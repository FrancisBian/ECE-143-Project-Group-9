0,Irreplaceable,"[Intro]
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left (Mmm)

[Verse 1]
To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet, that's my stuff
Yes, if I bought it, please don't touch (Don't touch)
And keep talking that mess that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time
And, it's my name that's on that jag
So remove your bags, let me call you a cab

[Pre-Chorus]
Standing in the front yard
Tellin' me, how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout, how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

[Chorus]
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

[Verse 2]
So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought, that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for?
'Cause you was untrue
Rollin' her around in the car that I bought you
Baby, drop them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves

[Pre-Chorus]
Standing in the front yard
Tellin' me, how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout, how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

[Chorus]
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I will have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable (Irreplaceable)

[Bridge]
So since I'm not your everything (Irreplaceable)
How about I'll be nothing (Nothing)
Nothing at all to you (Nothing)
Baby, I won't shed a tear for you (I won't shed a tear)
I won't lose a wink of sleep
'Cause the truth of the matter is
Replacing you was so easy

[Interlude]
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left (Mmm)
To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
To the left, to the left
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

[Chorus]
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking (Baby)
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute
You can pack all your bags (You must not know about me)
We're finished (You must not know about me)
'Cause you made your bed
Now lay in it
I can have another you by tomorrow
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable",Beyoncé,Beyonce,2006,"[1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 24, 87]",9

Shorty, I can see you ain’t lonely
Handful of niggease and they all got cheese
See you lookin’ at me now what its gon’ be
Just another tease far as I can see
Tryna get you up out this club
If it means spendin' a couple dubs
Throwin’ bout 30 stacks in the back make it rain like that

Girl I spend money like it don’t mean nothing and besides I got a thing for you

I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you... you already know
I wanna love you... you already know, girl

[Snoop Dogg]
Mobbin' through the club and I’m low pressin’
I’m sittin’ in the back in the smoker’s section (just smokin’)
Birds eye, I got a clear view
You can’t see me, but I can see you (baby I see you)
Hmm, it’s cool, we jet, the mood is set, your pussy is wet
You’re rubbin’ your back and touchin’ your neck
Your body is movin', you humpin' and jumpin'
Your titties is bouncin', you smilin' and grinnin' and lookin’ at me

[Akon]
Girl and while your lookin' at me I’m ready to hit the caddy
Right up on the patio move the patty to the caddy
Baby you got a phatty, the type I like to marry
Wantin’ to just give you everything and that’s kinda scary
Cause I'm loving the way you shake your ass
Bouncin', got me tippin' my glass
Normally don’t get caught up too fast
But I got a thing for you

Shady, Konvict, Upfront
Akon, Slim Shady
I see the one, could she be that lady? Ayy

[Chorus: Akon]
I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?
Look back and watch me
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1: Akon]
Upfront style, ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the 'Lac down
Konvict's got the whole thing packed now
Step in the club and wardrobe intact now
I feel it, dawnin' cracked now
Ooh, I see it dull and backed now
I'ma call her, then I put the mack down
Money no problem, pocket full of that now

I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Oh, looks like another club banger
They better hang on when they throw this thang on
Get a little drink on, they gon' flip
For this Akon shit, you can bank on it
Pedicure, manicure, kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Lookin' like one of them Putty-Cat Dolls
Tryin' to hold my woodie back through my drawers
Steps upstage, didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me, and she's like ""You're —""
I'm like, ""I know, let's cut to the chase""
No time to waste, back to my place
Plus from the club to the crib, it's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
And plus, I got a pal if your gal is game
In fact, he's the one singin' the song that's playin' (Akon!)

[Chorus: Akon]
I feel you creepin', I can you see from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?
Look back and watch me
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oooh

Eminem's rollin', D and 'em rollin'
Bu and all marvelous, them rollin'
Women just ho-in', big booty rollin'
Soon, I'll be all in them and throwin' D (D)
Hittin' no less than three (Three)
Block wheel style like whee (Whee)
Girl, I can tell you want me, because lately

[Chorus: Akon]
I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?

Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my—

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me (What would you do?)
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular? (Tell me, would you?)
Well, baby, I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl (Like you)
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you (Saying ""I do"")
Because

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sittin' on the grass, layin' side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot
My love (So don't give away)

My love (So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot, my love
Love, girl, my love, my love

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Now If I wrote you a love note
And made you smile at every word I wrote (What would you do?)
Would that make you wanna change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team? (Tell me, would you?)
See, what's the point in waitin' anymore?
'Cause girl, I've never been more sure (That, baby, it's you)
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you been waitin' for (Just say it, ""I do"")
Because

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sittin' on the grass, layin' side by side

Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love (So don't give away)

Shawty cool as a fan, on the move once again (Ay)
But he still has fans from Peru to Japan
Hey, listen, baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan (Nah)
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can
'Cause the girls worldwide throw they hands up high
When you wanna come and kick it with a stand-up guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen with a man so fly
And, babe, with friends so fly, I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle my B.I
They call me Candle Guy (Why?)
Simply 'cause I am on fire (Haha)
I hate to have to cancel my vacation, so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gon' try (Nah)
You don't come, I ain't gon' die
Hold up, what you mean you can't go? Why? (Why?)
Me and your boyfriend, we ain't no tie (Uh-huh)
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high (Man)
Baby, it's obvious that I ain't yo' guy
I ain't gon' lie, I'll fill your space
And forget your face, I swear I will
St. Barths, Anguilla, anywhere I chill (Nice)
Just bring with me any pair, I will (C'mon)

I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand

From my hands I could give you
Something that I made
From my mouth, I could sing you another brick that I laid
From my body, I could show you a place God knows
You should know the space is holy
Do you really wanna go?

[Intro]
I wear a mean dark pair of shades
And you can't see my eyes
Unless my head is bent, you dig

[Hook]
We fly high, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Foreign rides outside, it's like showbiz (we in the building)
We stay fly, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused

[Verse 1]
Ya boy gettin' paper (money), I buy big cars (foreign)
I need fly rides to drive in my garage (choose one!)
Stay sky high, twisted, fly with the stars (twinkle, twinkle)
G4 Flights, 80 grand large (ballin'!)
So we lean with it, pop with it (Bankhead)
'Vertible Jones, mean with the top missin' (flossin'!)
I'm sittin' clean with the bottom kitted (do it!)
I hopped out saggy jeans and my rock glistenin' (ballin'!)
But I spent 'bout 8 grand
Mami on stage doin' the rain dance (I think she like me)
She let it hit the floor, made it pop (what else?)
Got my pedal to the floor screamin', ""Fuck the cops!""

[Hook]
We fly high, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Foreign rides outside, it's like showbiz (we in the building)
We stay fly, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused

[Verse 2]
Slow down, tonight may be gone tomorrow (one chance)
So I speed through life like there's no tomorrow (speedin'!)
100 G's worth of ice on the Audemars (flossin'!)
And we in the street life 'til they call the law (ballin'!)
I made the whip get naked (what happened?)
While I switch gears, bitch lookin' at the bracelet
Step out, show me what you all about
Flashbacks of last night of me ballin' out (Harlem!)
1 AM we was at the club (what happened?)
2 AM: ten bottles of bub (money ain't a thing)
And 'bout 3-somethin' I was thinkin' 'bout grub
So I stumbled to the car, threw the drinks and the drugs (twisted)

[Hook]
We fly high, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Foreign rides outside, it's like showbiz (we in the building)
We stay fly, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused

[Verse 3]
Nigga, could you buy that? I keep 20 in the pocket (light change)
Talk a buck 80 if the Bentley is the topic (that Grey Poupon)
But of course got a Flying Spur
To the hood to roll dice on the side of the curb
But I know a G a bet may sound absurd (get your money up!)
Drive 80 up Lenox 'cause I got a urge (speedin'!)
The rap game like the crack game
Lifestyles, rich and famous, livin' in the fast lane (ballin'!)
So when I bleep, shorty bleep back
Lou' Vuitton belt where I'ma keep all the heat strapped
I beat the trial over Rucker (let's do it!)
All guns loaded and I'm back, motherfucker (Dipset)

You niggas need to stay focused
When you're dealin' with a motherfuckin' G
You know my name, Jones, One Eye, Capo Status

7,How To Save A Life,"[Verse 1]
Step one, you say we need to talk
He walks, you say sit down; it's just a talk
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

[Verse 2]
Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God He hears you
And pray to God He hears you, and

[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

[Verse 3]
As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

[Chorus]

Trying to study our approach
They like the way we do it, so original
I guess that they are slow, so they should leave the room
This beat is for the clubs and cars that go

[Verse 1: Divine from The D.E.Y.]
Yeah, you gonna remember me, boo
I'm gonna remember you too
I can't forget all the crazy shit we used to do
You was doing too much, I wasn't doing enough
That's what your friends are saying, you got a man anyway
I can't explain it either, I ain't never wanna leave ya
Hell yeah, it's hard to walk away when I see ya
When I see ya I remember the day
You put your shoes on and moved on before I could say...

[Verse 2: Paula DeAnda]
I saw you with your new girl just yesterday
And I feel that I must confess
Even though it kills me to have to say
I'll admit that I was impressed
Physically just short of perfection
Gotta commend you on your selection
Though I know I shouldn't be concerned
In the back of my mind, I can't help but question
Does she rub your feet? (When you've had a long day)
Scratch your scalp? (When you take out your braids)
Does she know that you like to play PS2 'til 6 in the morning like I do?

[Chorus: Paula DeAnda & Divine]
I can't explain this feeling (Yeah)
I think about it every day
And even though we've moved on (Uh-huh)
It gets so hard to walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
Walk away (Forever you will live in my memory)
Walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
Walk away (I can't forget how we used to be)

[Verse 3: Paula DeAnda]
Guess I gotta live my life from day to day
Hoping maybe you'll come back
And though I tell myself not to be afraid
To move on, but it seems I can't
Though a new man has given me attention
It ain't the same as your affection
Though I know I should be content
In the back of my mind, I can't help but question
Does he kiss me on the forehead? (Before we play)
Show up on my doorstep? (With a bouquet)
Does he call me in the middle of the day just to say, ""Baby, I love you"" (Like you used to?)

[Chorus: Paula DeAnda & Divine]
I can't explain this feeling (Yeah)
I think about it every day
And even though we've moved on (Uh-huh)
It gets so hard to walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
Walk away (Forever you will live in my memory)
Walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
Walk away (I can't forget how we used to be)

[Verse 4: Divine, Paula DeAnda, Both]
I'm gonna remember you (You're gonna remember me)
The things we did, the way we shared our fantasies
Just you and me; my friend, my love, my family
How did we lose a love that seemed meant to be?
Sometimes I kiss her and wish that it was you I'm kissing
Sometimes I miss him and wish that it was you I'm missing
Sometimes I hug her and wish that it was you I was hugging
And I realize how much I'm bugging
I miss you

[Bridge: Paula DeAnda & Divine]
So hard to express this feeling
'Cause nobody compares to you (To you)
And you know she'll never love you like I do (Yeah)

I think about it every day (Yeah)

Walk away (Walk away)

And she's probably getting frisky

Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know

Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats

Slashed a hole in all four tires

White-trash version of Shania karaoke

Three dollars worth of that bathroom polo

When me and Fif' got together to do this music
The more we became enveloped
We just developed a fellowship through it
It's no pretend shit, it's friendship, mi nemesis es su nemesis
Same for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images
But this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out
When it's beef you just gotta know when to butt in and butt out
If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it
It usually just evolves into one big brawl
And we all get involved in it
And we should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge with honor, pass it around and share it
And let it go to whoever's holdin'
The most current beef on their shoulders
And their soldiers got their backs 'til it's over
But tonight we ain't come in here to beef with nobody
We came to party: Banks, Ca$his, and Mr. Ferrari
So it's Shady, Aftermizath, back in that ass, you izzask?

26,Welcome To The Black Parade,"[Intro]
When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned?""
He said, ""Will you defeat them?
Your demons, and all the non-believers
The plans that they have made?
Because one day, I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer
To join the black parade...""
When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned?""

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know

[Chorus]
We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And in my heart I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it

[Verse 2]
A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back, let's shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end we hear the call

[Chorus]
To carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

[Bridge]
On and on, we carry through the fears (Oh, oh, oh)
Disappointed faces of your peers (Oh, oh, oh)
Take a look at me, 'cause I could not care at all
Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scars
Give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here, because it's who we are
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy, who had to sing this song
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
I don't care!

[Chorus]
We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on

Baby, come here and sit down, let's talk
I got a lot to say so I guess I'll start by
Saying that I love you
But you know, this thing ain't been no walk in the park for us
I swear it'll only take a minute
You'll understand when I finish, yeah
And I don't wanna see you cry
But I don't wanna be the one to tell you a lie so

[Pre-Chorus]
How do you let it go when you, you just don't know
What's on the other side of the door when you're walking out? Talk about it
And everything I tried to remember to say just went out my head
So I'ma do the best I can to get you to understand 'cause I know

[Chorus]
There's never a right time to say goodbye (Yeah)
But I gotta make the first move
'Cause if I don't you gonna start hating me
'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl, it's not you, it's me, I
Kinda gotta figure out what I need, oh
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go our separate ways
And I know it's hard but I gotta do it and it's killing me
'Cause there's never a right time, right time to say goodbye

[Verse 2]
Girl, I know your heart is breaking
And a thousand times I found myself asking, ""Why? Why?""
Why am I taking so long to say this?
But trust me, girl, I never
Meant to crush your world and I never
Thought I would see the day we grew apart
And I wanna know

How do you let it go when you, you just don't know

We should be apart, baby I

Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing and
There's no way we ever could
Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it

[Chorus]
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change

[Verse 2]
Now if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
But when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
Because when they own the information, oh
They can bend it all they want

[Chorus]
That's why we're waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
It's not that we don't care
We just know that the fight isn't fair
So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

Now little Lisa's only nine years old
She's tryin to figure out why the world is so cold
Why she's all alone and they never met her family
Momma's always gone and she never met her daddy
Part of her is missin and nobody'll listen
Momma's on drugs gettin high up in the kitchen
Bringin home men at different hours of the night
Startin with some laughs, usually endin in a fight
Sneakin in her room when her momma's knocked out
Tryin to have his way and little Lisa says ouch
She tries to resist but then all he does is beat her
Tries to tell her mom but her momma don't believe her
Lisa's stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get some clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and never come back (Like this)

She's steady tryin to figure why the world is so cold
Why she's not pretty and nobody seems to like her
Alcoholic stepdad always wanna strike her
Yells and abuses, leaves her with some bruises
Teachers ask questions, she's makin up excuses
Bleedin on the inside, cryin on the out
It's only one girl really knows what she's about
Her name is little Stacy and they become friends
Promise that they'll always be tight 'til the end
Until one day lil' Stacy gets shot
A drive-by bullet went stray up on her block
Now Nicole's stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get her clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and NEVER come back

She's steady tryin to figure why the world is so cold
So she pops X to get rid of all the pain
Plus she's havin sex with her boy who's sixteen
Emotions run deep as she thinks she's in love
So there's no protection, he's usin no glove
Never thinkin 'bout the consequences of her actions
Livin for today and not tomorrow's satisfaction
The days go by and her belly gets big
The father bails out, he ain't ready for a kid
Knowin her momma would blow it all out of proportion
Plus she lives poor so no money for abortion
Erica is stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get her clothes and pack
She says she 'bout to run away and NEVER come back, ah!

With her brown hair a-blowing

[Verse: Justin Timberlake]
You spend your nights alone and he never comes home
And every time you call him, all you get's a busy tone
I heard you found out that he's doin' to you
What you did to me, ain't that the way it goes?

So it goes without sayin' that you left me feelin' hurt
Just a classic case, a scenario
Tale as old as time, girl, you got what you deserved

To cure the lonely nights (Hey)

Let's jump in, see how far it goes
You got my heart in your daddy's boat
We've got all night to make it float
We could sit on the shore
We could just be friends
Or we could jump in

The whole world could change in a minute
Just one kiss could stop it spinning
We could think it through
But i don't want to, if you don't want to
We could keep things just the same
Leave here the way we came
With nothing to lose
But i don't want to, if you don't want to

[Verse 2]
I got your ring around my neck
And a couple of nights i don't regret
You've got a dream of a degree and a shirt that smells like me
Yeah we both got dreams
We could chase alone
Or we could make our own

The whole world could change in a minute
Just one kiss could stop it spinning
We could think it through

We could keep things just the same
Leave here the way we came

39,Watching You,"[Verse 1]
Driving through town
Just my boy and me
With a happy meal in his booster seat
Knowing that he couldn't have the toy
'Till his nuggets were gone
A green traffic light turned straight to red
I hit my brakes and mumbled under my breath
His fries went a-flying and his orange drink covered his lap
Well then my four year old said a four letter word
That started with ""S"" and I was concerned
So I said, ""Son now where did you learn to talk like that?""

[Chorus]
He said ""I've been watching you dad, ain't that cool?
I'm your buckaroo, I wanna be like you
And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are
We got cowboy boots and camo pants
Yeah we're just alike, hey ain't we dad?
I wanna do everything you do
So I've been watching you""

[Verse 2]
We got back home and I went to the barn
I bowed my head and I prayed real hard
Said, ""Lord please help me help my stupid self""
Then this side of bedtime later that night
Turning on my son's Scooby Doo nightlight
He crawled out of bed and he got down on his knees
He closed his little eyes, folded his little hands
And spoke to God like he was talking to a friend
And I said, ""Son now where'd you learn to pray like that?""

[Chorus]
He said ""I've been watching you dad, ain't that cool?
I'm your buckaroo, I wanna be like you
And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are
We like fixing things and holding mama's hand
Yeah we're just alike, hey ain't we dad?
I wanna do everything you do
So I've been watching you""

[Bridge]
With tears in my eyes I wrapped him in a hug
Said, ""My little bear is growing up""
He said, ""But when I'm big I'll still know what to do""

[Chorus]
Cause I've been watching you dad, ain't that cool?
I'm your buckaroo, I wanna be like you
And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are

40,Through Glass,"[Chorus]
I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
Oh, God, it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
That forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head
'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
All I know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
That forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head

[Verse 1]
How do you feel? That is the question
But I forget you don't expect an easy answer
When something like a soul becomes initialized and folded up
Like paper dolls and little notes, you can't expect a bit of hope
So while you're outside looking in, describing what you see
Remember what you're staring at is me

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
All I know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
That forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head

[Verse 2]
How much is real? So much to question
An epidemic of the mannequins, contaminating everything
We thought came from the heart, but never did right from the start
Just listen to the noises, null and void instead of voices
Before you tell yourself, it's just a different scene
Remember it's just different from what you've seen

[Chorus]
I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
And all I know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
That forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head
'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
And all I know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
That forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head

I'm looking at you through the glass

That forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head

42,My Little Girl,"[Verse 1]
Gotta hold on easy as I let you go
Gonna tell you how much I love you, though you think you already know
I remember I thought you looked like an angel wrapped in pink so soft and warm
You've had me wrapped around your finger since the day you were born

[Chorus]
You're beautiful baby from the outside in
Chase your dreams but always know the road that'll lead you home again
Go on, take on this whole world
But to me you know you'll always be, my little girl

[Verse 2]
When you were in trouble that crooked little smile could melt my heart of stone
Now look at you, I've turned around and you've almost grown
Sometimes you're asleep I whisper ""I Love You!"" in the moonlight at your door
As I walk away, I hear you say, ""Daddy Love You More!""

[Chorus]
You're beautiful baby from the outside in
Chase your dreams but always know the road that'll lead you home again
Go on, take on this whole world
But to me you know you'll always be, my little girl

[Verse 3]
Someday, some boy will come and ask me for your hand
But I won't say ""yes"" to him unless I know, he's the half
That makes you whole, he has a poet's soul, and the heart of a man's man
I know he'll say that he's in love
But between you and me, he won't be good enough!

43,It's Not Over,"[Verse 1]
I was blown away
What could I say?
It all seemed to make sense
You've taken away everything
And I can't deal with that
I try to see the good in life
But good things in life are hard to find
We'll blow it away, blow it away

Can we make this something good?
Well, I'll try to do it right this time around

Let's start over
Try to do it right this time around
It's not over
'Cause a part of me is dead and in the ground
This love is killing me, but you're the only one
It's not over

[Verse 2]
I've taken all I could take
And I cannot wait
We're wasting too much time
Being strong, holding on
Can't let it bring us down
My life with you means everything
So I won't give up that easily
I'll blow it away, blow it away

Can we make this something good?
'Cause it's all misunderstood
Well, I'll try to do it right this time around

44,Tim McGraw,"[Verse 1]
He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, ""That's a lie""
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

[Chorus]
But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

[Verse 2]
September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

[Chorus]
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

[Bridge]
And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:
""When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place""

[Chorus]
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
Oh, think of me

45,What Hurts The Most,"[Verse 1]
I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That don’t bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
I’m not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though goin' on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I’m okay
But that’s not what gets me

[Chorus]
What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin' so much to say
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowing
What could've been
And not seein' that love in you
Is what I was tryin’ to do

[Verse 2]
It’s hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I’m doin’ It
It’s hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I’m alone
Still harder
Gettin' up, gettin' dressed, livin’ with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken

[Chorus]
What hurts the most
Is being so close
And havin' so much to say much to say
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowing
What could've been
And not seeing that love in you
Is what I was trying to do, oh

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin' so much to say (much to say)
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been

Let's play a game, let's pretend for a second
You don't know who I am or what I do
Let's just put it to the side
I can feel your heart beating, I can hear you breathing
Look into your eyes, trying to see into your mind

See into your soul, no limits to the levels me and you can go
When it's me, I take control
But it's something about you that makes me wanna change
I like the way you dancing and the way you play the game

I like the way you take away the pain
The way you tell me that you want it, not saying a thing
The way you got me going, got me going outta my brain
I see us going at it, going in and outta them lanes

I don't want your innocence, I don't want you to stutter
I don't want a commitment and I don't want you to suffer
I don't want your number, baby, I want you to wonder
I want you to come up looking like there’s something you wanna

Tell me
What you thinking about when you got me waiting patiently
And usually, I don't have to wait for nobody
But there's something about you that really got me feeling weak
And I'm trying to find the words to speak

Boy, I got my eyes on you
So tell me what you wanna do
I can picture you in my room
Until the morning

I don't even know your name

You're pulsating, your heart is beating outta your chest
You're hyperventilating, you’re trying to catch your breath

I'm the first, I'm the next, I'm the end
I'm the force in your thoughts, that'll make your mind bend
Look how I approached you, look how I expose you
Look how I done studied every move, now I know you

I don't wanna control you, I wanna console you
And do everything that I told you
Get high with me, come touch the sky with me
Fly with me, see life with new eyes with me

(Don't stop)
I'm the dream, I'm the one, I'm the reason you come
I'm a king, I'm a hung, I'm a beast
I'm the last thing your eyes see, the passion's inside me
It's yours, now come try me, c'mon

Tell me
What you thinking about when your hands is all on me
‘Cause I've been thinking about all the possibilities
Ain't no other place that I really wanna be
‘Cause you swept me off my feet, ooh

Words is slurring, engine purring

I ain't talking bout the 2-3
Mami in the zone like the homie two-three
Jordan or James, makes no difference
We all ballin' the same
Nigga, I am the Mike Jordan of recordin'
Nigga, you might want to fall back from recordin'
What you write is not important
So it forced him to go for the hype
For being brave they may applaud him
But misery, I will assure them
Aww baby, just ignore them
Truth or dare, mami, listen and learn
I got a drop, I just took off the top, it's your turn

I'll take the cork off, you can take sips
I'll take you there, take my time
Take your clothes off, you take off mine
Ma, show me what you got

54,White & Nerdy,"[Chorus 1]
They see me mowin' my front lawn
I know they're all thinking I'm so white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Can't you see I'm white and nerdy?
Look at me, I'm white and nerdy
I wanna roll with the gangstas
But so far they all think I'm too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
I'm just too white and nerdy
Really, really white and nerdy

[Verse 1]
First in my class here at MIT
Got skills, I'm a champion at D&D
M.C. Escher—that's my favorite ""M.C.""
Keep your 40, I'll just have an Earl Grey tea
My rims never spin, to the contrary
You'll find that they're quite stationary
All of my action figures are cherry
Stephen Hawking's in my library
My MySpace page is all totally pimped out
Got people beggin' for my Top 8 spaces
Yo, I know pi to a thousand places
Ain't got no grills, but I still wear braces
I order all of my sandwiches with mayonnaise
I'm a whiz at Minesweeper—I could play for days
Once you see my sweet moves, you're gonna stay amazed
My fingers movin' so fast I'll set the place ablaze
There's no killer app  I haven't run
At Pascal, well, I'm number one
Do vector calculus just for fun
I ain't got a gat but I got a soldering gun
""Happy Days"" is my favorite theme song
I could sure kick your butt in a game of ping pong
I'll ace any trivia quiz you bring on
I'm fluent in JavaScript as well as Klingon
(Here's the part I sing on)

[Chorus 2]
They see me roll on my Segway
I know in my heart they think I'm white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Can't you see I'm white and nerdy?
Look at me, I'm white and nerdy
I'd like to roll with the gangstas
Although it's apparent I'm too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
I'm just too white and nerdy
How'd I get so white and nerdy?

[Verse 2]
I've been browsin', inspectin'
X-Men comics, you know I collect 'em
The pens in my pocket, I must protect 'em
My ergonomic keyboard never leaves me bored
Shopping online for deals on some writable media
I edit Wikipedia
I memorized Holy Grail really well
I can recite it right now and have you ""ROTFLOL""
I got a business doing websites
When my friends need some code, who do they call?
I do HTML for 'em all, even made a homepage for my dog, yo
I got myself a fanny pack
They were havin' a sale down at The Gap
Spend my nights with a roll of bubble wrap
Pop, pop, hope no one sees me, gettin' freaky
I'm nerdy in the extreme and whiter than sour cream
I was in AV Club and Glee Club and even the Chess Team
Only question I ever thought was hard
Was do I like Kirk or do I like Picard?
Spend every weekend at the Renaissance Fair
Got my name on my underwear

[Chorus 3]
They see me strollin', they laughin'
And rollin' their eyes 'cause I'm so white and nerdy
Just because I'm white and nerdy
Just because I'm white and nerdy
All because I'm white and nerdy
Holy cow, I'm white and nerdy!
I wanna bowl with the gangstas
But, oh well, it's obvious I'm white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
I'm just too white and nerdy

Hip hop, hip hop (Ugh!) is dead
(Had to flip this track again, y'all!)
Hip, hip hop, hip hop (Ugh!) is dead
Hip, hip hop (Ugh!)
Hip, hip hop is dead (NYC! Dirty South!)
Hip, hip hop (West Coast!)
Hip hop (Midwest!)
Hip hop (Let's go!)

[Hook: Nas & will.i.am]
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll load an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
(Hip hop just died this morning
And she's dead, she's dead)

[Verse 1: Nas]
Yeah, niggas smoke, chill, party and die in the same corner
Get cash, live fast, body their man's mama
Quick fast, trigger fingers on the llama
Revenge in their eyes, Hennessy and the ganja
Word to the wise with villain state of minds
Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind
Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind
(Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind)
Whenever, if ever, I roll up, it's sown up
Any ghetto will tell ya, ""Nas helped grow us up""
My face once graced promotional Sony trucks
Hundred million and billin', I helped blow 'em up
Gave my man my right, I could have went left
So like my girl Foxy, the kid went deaf
So people, who's your top 10? Is it MC Shan? Is it MC Ren?

[Hook: Nas & will.i.am]
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ

Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
(Hip hop just died this morning
And she's dead, she's dead)

[Verse 2: Nas]
The bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin'
Come through, something ill, missing the ceilin'
What influenced my raps? Stick-ups and killings
Kidnappings, project buildings, drug dealings
Criticize that, why's that?
‘Cause Nas rap is compared to legitimized crap
‘Cause we love to talk on nasty chickens
Most intellectuals will only half listen
So you can't blame jazz musicians
Or David Stern with his NBA fashion issues
Oh, I think they like me, in my white tee
You can't ice me, we here for life, B
On my second marriage, hip hop's my first wifey
And for that, we not taking it lightly
If hip hop should die, we die together
Bodies in the morgue lie together, all together now

[Hook: Nas & will.i.am]
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ

Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
(Hip hop just died this morning
And she's dead, she's dead)

[Verse 3: Nas]
Everybody sound the same, commercialize the game
Reminiscing when it wasn't all business
It forgot where it started
So we all gather here for the dearly departed
Hip-hopper since a toddler
One homeboy became a man, then a mobster
If it dies, let me get my last swig of vodka
RIP, we'll donate your lungs to a rasta
Went from turntables to MP3's
From ""Beat Street""to commercials on Mickey D's
From gold cables to Jacobs
From plain facials to Botox and face lifts
I'm looking over my shoulder
It's about 80 people from my hood that showed up
And they came to show love
Sold out concert and the doors are closed shut",Nas,Nas Featuring will.i.am,2006,"[56, 76]",2

But he talks like a gentlemen
Like you imagined
When you were young

Can we climb this mountain? I don't know
Higher now than ever before
I know we can make it if we take it slow
Let's take it easy
Easy now, watch it go

On the back of a hurricane that started turning
When you were young
When you were young

[Interlude]
And sometimes you close your eyes
And see the place where you used to live
When you were young

It's not a diss song, it's just a real song
Feel me?

[Couplet 1]
I heard motherfuckers saying they made Hov
Made Hov say ""Ok so make another Hov""
Niggas wasn't playing they day role
So we parted ways like Ben and J-Lo
I shoulda been did it but I been in a daze though
I put friends over business end of the day though
But when friends' business interests is Day Glow
Ain't nothing left to say though
I guess we forgot what we came for
Shoulda stayed in food and beverage
Too much flossing
Too much Sam Rothstein
I ain't a bitch but I gotta divorce them
Hov had to get the shallow shit up off him
And I ain't even want to be famous
Niggas is brainless to unnecessarily go through these changes
And I ain't even know how it came to this
Except that fame is
The worst drug known to man
It's stronger than, heroin
When you could look in the mirror like, ""There I am""
And still not see, what you've become
I know I'm guilty of it too but, not like them
You lost one

[Refrain (Chrisette Michele)]
Lose one, let go to get one
Get one, lose some to win some (You lost one)
Story of a champion, sorry I'm a champion
You lost one

[Couplet 2]
I don't think it's meant to be, be
But she loves her work more than she does me
And honestly, at twenty-three
I would probably love my work more than I did she
So, we, ain't we
It's me, and her
Cause what she prefers over me, is work
And that's, where we, differ
So I have to give her
Free, time, even if it hurts
So breathe, mami, it's deserved
You've been put on this earth to be
All you can be, like the reserves
And me ? My time in the army, it's served
So I have to allow she, her, time to serve
The time's now for her
In time she'll mature
And maybe we, can be, we, again like we were
Finally, my time's too short to share
And to ask her now, it ain't fair
So yeah, she lost one

[Refrain]

[Couplet 3]
My nephew died in the car I bought
So I'm under the belief it's partly my fault
Close my eyes and squeeze, try to block that thought
Place any burden on me, but please, not that Lord
But time don't go back, it goes forward
Can't run from the pain, go towards it
Some things can't be explained, what caused it ?
Such a beautiful soul, so pure, shit !
Gonna see you again, I'm sure of it
'Til that time, little man I'm nauseous
Your girlfriend's pregnant, the lord's gift
Almost lost my faith, that restored it
It's like having your life restarted
Can't wait for your child's life, to be a part of it
So now I'm child-like, waiting for a gift
To return, when I lost you, I lost it

61,Here It Goes Again,"[Verse 1]
It could be ten, but then again I can't remember
Half an hour since a quarter to four
Throw on your clothes, the second side of Surfer Rosa
And you leave me with my jaw on the floor
Hey!

[Chorus]
Oh, just when you think you're in control
Just when you think you've got a hold
Just when you get on a roll
Oh here it goes, here it goes, here it goes again
Oh here it goes again
I should've known, should've known, should've known again
But here it goes again
Oh, oh here it goes again

Starts out easy, something simple, something sleazy
Something inching past the edge of reserve
Now through the lines of the cheap Venetian blinds
Your car is pulling off of the curb

Just when you think you've got a hold

He gets up before the dawn
Packs a lunch and a thermos full of coffee
It's another day in the dusty haze
Those burnin' rays are wearin' down his body
The diesel's worth the price of gold
It's the cheapest grain he's ever sold
But he's still holdin' on

[Chorus]
He just takes the tractor another round
And pulls the plow across the ground
And sends up another prayer
He says, ""Lord, I never complain, I never ask 'Why?'
Please don't let my dreams run dry
Underneath, underneath this Amarillo Sky""

[Verse 2]
That hail storm back in '83
Sure did take a toll on his family
But he stayed strong and carried on
Just like his Dad and Granddad did before him
On his knees every night
He prays, ""Please let my crops and children grow""
'Cause that's all he is ever known

[Chorus]
He just takes the tractor another round
And pulls the plow across the ground
And sends up another prayer
He says, ""Lord, I never complain, I never ask 'Why?'
Please don't let my dreams run dry
Underneath, underneath this Amarillo Sky""

And he takes the tractor another round. (Another round)

64,Into The Ocean,"[Verse 1]
I'm just a normal boy
That sank when I fell overboard
My ship would leave the country
But I'd rather swim ashore
Without a life vest, I'd be stuck again
Wish I was much more masculine
Maybe then I could learn to swim
(Like fourteen miles away)
Now floating up and down
I spin, colliding into sound
Like whales beneath me diving down
I'm sinking to the bottom of my
Everything that freaks me out
The lighthouse beam has just run out
I'm cold as cold as cold can be
Be

[Chrous]
I want to swim away but don't know how
Sometimes it feels just like I'm falling in the ocean
Let the waves up take me down
Let the hurricane set in motion, yeah
Let the rain of what I feel right now come down
Let the rain come down

[Verse 2]
Where is the coastguard?
I keep looking each direction
For a spotlight, give me something
I need something for protection
Maybe flotsam junk will do just fine
The jetsam sunk, I'm left behind
I'm treading for my life believe me
(How can I keep up this breathing?)
Not knowing how to think
I scream aloud, begin to sink
My legs and arms are broken down
With envy for the solid ground
I'm reaching for the life within me
How can one man stop his ending?
I thought of just your face
Relaxed, and floated into space

[Chorus]
I want to swim away but don't know how
Sometimes it feels just like I'm falling in the ocean
Let the waves up take me down
Let the hurricane set in motion, yeah
Let the rain of what I feel right now come down
Let the rain come down

[Verse 3]
Now waking to the sun
I calculate what I had done
Like jumping from the bow, yeah
Just to prove that I knew how, yeah
It's midnight's late reminder of
The loss of her, the one I love
My will to quickly end it all
Set front row in my need to fall
Into the ocean, end it all
Into the ocean, end it all
Into the ocean, end it all
Into the ocean, end it all

65,Some People Change,"His old man was a rebel yeller
Bad boy to the bone
He'd say, ""Can't trust that other feller""
He'd judge 'em by the tone of their skin

He was raised to think like his Dad
Narrow mind, full of hate
On the road to nowhere fast
Till the Grace of God got in the way

Then he saw the light and hit his knees
And cried and said a prayer
Rose up a brand new man
Left the old one right there

Here's to the strong
Thanks to the brave
Don't give up hope

Against all odds
Against the grain
Love finds a way
Some people change

She was born with her mother's habit
You could say it's in her blood
She hates that she's gotta have it
As she fills her glass up

She'd love to kill that bottle
But all she can think about
Is a better life, a second chance
And everyone she's letting down
She throws that bottle down

Here's to the strong
Thanks to the brave
Don't give up hope

Against all odds
Against the grain
Love finds a way

My strings all get tangled, my wires all get crossed
Every now and then I'm right up on the edge
Dangling my toes out over the ledge
I just thank God you're here

Cause when I'm a bullet shot out of a gun
Cause when I'm a firecracker coming undone
Or when I'm a fugitive ready to run, all wild-eyed and crazy

It's hard loving' a man that's got a gypsy soul

That I couldn't live one day without your love

73,The Saints Are Coming,"[Intro: Billie Joe Armstrong]
There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
It's been the ruin of many a poor boy
God, I know I'm one

I cried to my daddy on the telephone: ""How long now""?
Until the clouds unroll and you come down, the line went
But the shadows still remain since your descent, your descent

The saints are coming, the saints are coming
I say no matter how I try, I realise there's no reply

[Verse 2: Bono]
A drowning sorrow floods the deepest grief, how long now?
Until a weather change condemns belief, how long now?
When the night watchman lets in the thief, what's wrong now?
Boom, cha, hey!

The saints are coming, the saints are coming
I say no matter how I try, I realise there's no reply

Hey, girl, you know you drive me crazy
One look puts the rhythm in my hand

You cry alone, and then
He swears he loves you

So why do you act like you don’t care?
Like all this love between us isn’t there

I know that you want me to pay for all the pain I’ve caused
But in the end, it all comes down to just one thing
It’s you and me, so I sing

When the pearls in our shells got up to dance
You call me a bad tipper of the cradle

Sharpening the knives of young wives
Take two years and call me when you're better
Take teardrops of mine, find yourself wetter

Shorty I'm never slipping got the Beretta in vision
And ready to pop the clip in, ready to get to tripping
Ready to show these folks a celebrity pistol whipping
Pimp stole the automobile and the roof for the tag missing
Polices' try to pursue me it's nothing but gas given
Addicted to fast living, guess I'm one of my dad's children
Think I'm bad now, you should've seen me before I had children
Give dick to your daddy's daughter and dare her to have children
Hope he got some insurance cause death her ass is enduring
Kill her in Mississippi and drive her ass to Missouri

85,I Loved Her First,"Look at the two of you dancing that way
Lost in the moment and each other's face
So much in love your alone in this place
Like there's nobody else in the world
I was enough for her not long ago
I was her number one, she told me so
And she still means the world to me
Just so you know
So be careful when you hold my girl
Time changes everything
Life must go on
And I'm not going to stand in your way

But I loved her first, I held her first
And a place in my heart will always be hers
From the first breath she breathed
When she first smiled at me
I knew the love of a father runs deep
And I prayed that she'd find you someday
But it still hard to give her away
I loved her first

How could that beautiful woman with you
Be the same freckle face kid that I knew
The one that I read all those fairy tales to
And tucked into bed all those nights
And I knew the first time I saw you with her
It was only a matter of time

But I loved her first and I held her first
And a place in my heart will always be hers
From the first breath she breathed
When she first smiled at me
I knew the love of a father runs deep
And I prayed that she'd find you someday
But its still hard to give her away
I loved her first

From the first breath she breathed

Read the lines in the mirror through the lipstick trace

Hit the switch, show niggas how the shit go

The Ds is chrome, the frame is black (So watch it lift up)
'Til the motherfucker bounce and break
And knock both of the screws out the licence plate
Let the games begin
These other rap niggas so far behind me could taste my rims
Shit, let the chronic burn as the Daytons spin
It ain’t been this much drama since I first heard Eminem
In the club, poppin' X pills like M&Ms
Call it Dre day, we celebratin', bitch bring a friend
Bottles on me, tell the waiter to order another round
And put that cheap-ass Hypnotic down (Put your ‘cris up!)
If you feel the same way
Who got 'em hittin' switches NY to LA

[Chorus]
(If I could fit the whole hood in the club)
Hop in the low-rider, long as you got bitches in the back
(I turn it into a strip-club)
Call it a lap-dance, when the six-fo' bounce that ass
(If I could fit the hole world in the club)
Tell the DJ to bang my shit, the west-coast in this bitch
(Pop bottles and twist up)
Roll up chronic and hash
In a blunt, call it Aftermath

Somebody tell me where the drinks at, where the bitches at
You fuckin' on the first night, meet me in the back
I got a pound of chronic, and a gang of freaks
Move bitch! Who the fuck you think they came to see?
The protégé of the D-R-E
Take a picture with him, then you gotta fuck me
And you gotta fuck Busta, can’t touch Eve
Got somethin' in my waist that you can’t touch either
That’s, my gangsta bitch, and like Crips and Bloods
I’m in the club on some gangsta shit (So nigga twist up)
Light another dub
Bitches get scared when niggas start fightin' in the club
Ain’t nothin' but a g-thing, baby it’s a g-thing
Bounce like you got hydraulics in your g-string
I fuck a different bitch seven days a week
Hit the switch, watch it bounce like a Scott Storch beat

Hoppin' out the same Cherry six-fo'
With the motherfucking top down, I'm The Game, nigga
Call your bitch, she ain't home, she with Game, nigga
Remember that, Dre you passed me the torch
I lit the chronic with it, now the world is my ashtray
Ridin' three-wheel motion ‘till the ass scrapes
Turn sunset into a motherfucking drag-race
Now watch it bounce
Hit the switch, let it bounce till the police shut the shit down

Tell 'em you came with me (We gonna twist up)

Same chronic, just a different smoke

This is for all you sophisticated ladies out there

[Verse 1]
She grew up in the city in a little subdivision
Her daddy wore a tie, mama never fried a chicken
Ballet, straight-As, most likely to succeed
They bought her a car after graduation
Sent her down South for some higher education
Put her on the fast track to a Law Degree
Now she's coming home to visit
Holding the hand of a wild-eyed boy
With a farmers tan

Shes riding in the middle of his pickup truck
Blaring Charlie Daniels, yelling, Turn it up!
They raised her up a lady, but there's one thing
They couldn't avoid
Ladies love country boys

[Verse 2]
You know mamas and daddies want better for their daughters
Hope they'll settle down with a doctor or a lawyer
And their uptown, ball gown, hand-me-down royalty
They never understand why their princess falls
For some camouflage britches and a southern-boy-drawl

She's riding in the middle of his pickup truck
Blaring Hank Jr., yelling, turn it up
They raised her up a lady, but there's one thing
They couldn't avoid, ladies love country boys

Right from wrong but its still going to turn them on

90,Nothing Left To Lose,"Something's in the air tonight
The sky's alive with a burning light
You can mark my words something's about to break

And I found myself in a bitter fight
While I've held your hand through the darkest night
Don't know where you're coming from but you're coming soon

To a kid from Oregon by way of California
All of this is more than I've ever known or seen

Come on and we'll sing, like we were free
Push the pedal down, watch the world around fly by us
Come on and we'll try, one last time
I'm off of the floor one more time to find you

And here we go, there's nothing left to choose
And here we go, there's nothing left to lose

So I packed my car and I headed east
Where I felt your fire and a sweet release
There's a fire in these hills, that's coming now

And I don't know much but I found you here
And I cannot wait another year
Don't know where you're coming from, but you're coming soon

To a kid from Oregon by way of California
All of this is more than I've ever known or seen

Come on and we'll sing, like we were free
Push the pedal down, watch the world around fly by us
Come on and we'll try, one last time
I'm off of the floor one more time to find you

And here we go, there's nothing left to choose
And here we go, there's nothing left to lose

I can still hear the trains out my window
From Hobart street to here in Nashville
I can still smell the pomegranates grow
And I don't know how hard this wind will blow
Or where we'll go

Come on and we'll sing, like we were free
Push the pedal, down watch the world around fly by us
Come on and we'll try, one last time
I'm off of the floor one more time to find you

93,I'll Be Home For Christmas (Live),"BLACK.

ELLIOT (Voiceover): Hello friend. Hello friend? That’s lame. Maybe I should give you a name? But that’s a slippery slope. You’re only in my head. We have to remember that. Shit. It’s actually happened. I’m talking to an imaginary person.

Within the black of frame, silhouettes begin forming.

ELLIOT (V.O.): What I'm about to tell you is top-secret.

We pull out to reveal we’re in an office looking out of a very tall Manhattan skyscraper. Shadowy figures sit and stand around a conference table, arguing.

ELLIOT (V.O.): A conspiracy bigger than all of us. There's a powerful group of people out there who are secretly running the world.

ELLIOT (V.O.): I'm talking about the guys that no one knows about. The guys that are invisible. The top 1% of the top 1%. The guys that play God without permission.

CUT TO BLACK.

ELLIOT (V.O.): And now I think they’re following me.

INT. NYC SUBWAY (MOVING) - MORNING

We finally meet ELLIOT (late 20s). His hoodie throws a sliced shadow over his face.

He sneaks looks at a couple of mysterious MEN DRESSED IN BLACK, one on either side of the train. One reads the NY Post. The other looks straight ahead, suspiciously so.

ELLIOT (V.O.): This is about last night. I should have gone to Angela’s birthday party. Instead I went to--

INT. RON’S COFFEE (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT

A large coffee shop with a fair amount of patrons. A cheesy sign that reads “Ron's Coffee” displays on the door. Elliot sits by himself, hoodie on, no coffee. His leg taps nervously.

Elliot intently watches as a mild-mannered Indian with a mustache walks into the shop. This is RON (40s-50s).

He orders a latte from the front and sits alone. He pulls out his iPad and sips his latte, enjoying the quiet evening to himself.

Elliot musters courage with a deep breath and walks over. He sits across from him without saying a word, his leg twitching.

RON stares at him.

ELLIOT: You're Ron.

He nervously gestures to the cheesy sign. Confused, Ron glares at him in response.

ELLIOT (nervous and robotic): But your real name is Rohit Mehta. You changed it to Ron when you bought your first Ron’s Coffee shop six years ago. Now you got 17 of 'em with 8 more coming next quarter.

An awkward silence. Ron tilts his head, not sure if he should be flattered or concerned.

RON (thick Indian accent): May I help you with something?

ELLIOT: I like coming here 'cause your Wi-Fi was fast. I mean, you're one of the few spots that has a fiber connection with gigabit speed. It's good. So good, it scratched that part of my mind, part that doesn't allow good to exist without condition, so I started intercepting all the traffic on your network. That's when I noticed something strange. It's when I decided to hack you.

Another awkward silence. Ron leans forward.

RON: Hack--

ELLIOT: I know you run a website - called Plato's Boys.

Alarms suddenly go off in Ron’s world.

RON: Pardon me?

ELLIOT: You're using Tor networking to keep the servers anonymous. You made it really hard for anyone to see it, but I saw it.

Even though Elliot came off a little amateurish at first, his confidence builds as he continues to talk.

ELLIOT: The onion routing protocol, it's not as anonymous as you think it is. Whoever's in control of the exit nodes is also in control of the traffic, which makes me...the one in control.

RON: I must ask you to kindly leave--

Elliot pulls out a thick folder of files and places it on the table.

ELLIOT: I own everything. All your emails. All your files. All your pics.

Ron flips through a few pages then slaps the folder close.

RON (angry): Get out of here right now, or I'll call the--

ELLIOT: Police? You want them to find out about the 100 terabytes of child pornography you serve to your 400,000 users?

Ron is stunned silent. Ron looks down, cornered and speechless. Elliot looks genuinely sympathetic.

ELLIOT: Personally, man, I was hoping it was just gonna be some BDSM stuff. You realize how much simpler that would have been?

RON: I did not hurt anyone. I never did. That's my personal life.

All the blood in Phil’s face as drained. Emotion begins to fill his face. Elliot looks at him, a mix of pity and guilt.

ELLIOT: I understand what it's like to be different. I'm very different too. I mean, I don't jerk off to little kids, but I don't know how to talk to people. My dad was the only one I could talk to. But he died.

At first, Ron is unsure on how to proceed. But sensing an opportunity, he takes a deep breath and nods sympathetically.

RON: I'm sorry to hear that. How did he pass, may I ask?

ELLIOT: Leukemia. He definitely got it from radiation at the company he worked at, though I couldn't prove it. Now he's dead. Company's fine, though.

Ron can’t help but start crying. Elliot genuinely feels for him.

ELLIOT: Oh hey. It's okay, Rohit. You don't have to worry anymore.

Ron looks up, confused.

RON (confused then angry): I don't understand. Are you blackmailing me? So that's what this is about money. That's all you care about, huh? No. If I pay you now, you'll want more and more. No matter how much I give. You will inform the police anyway. I won't pay you, sir. Remember, you also broke the law.

Elliot nods agreeingly. He looks out the windows, as if looking for something.

ELLIOT: Actually, you're right. Partly. See, I usually do this kind of thing from my computer, but this time I wanted to do it AFK. In person. Trying to work on my social anxiety. But there's always the threat of you fleeing after I call you out.

Elliot leans over and begins to zip up his bag, getting ready to stand.

ELLIOT: You'd tell your sys admin to take your servers down, wipe all the data.

Elliot stands, putting his oversized bookbag on.

ELLIOT: So I made sure to include the current time and and location on my anonymous tip.

Ron stands up with Elliot.

RON (desperate, nervous): Wait. Hold on. I'll give you the money. I'll pay you. How much do you want? I'll pay you.

Sirens can be heard. Lights swirl outside the windows.

ELLIOT: That's the part you were wrong about, Rohit. I don't give a shit about money.

POLICE race into the shop as Elliot breezes past them, heading out, leaving the chaos to surround the destroyed Phil.

Violent jazz slowly BUILDS on the soundtrack.

TITLE SEQUENCE

INT. NYC SUBWAY (MOVING) - MORNING

Back to present day, Elliot snaps awake. He eyes the two MEN IN BLACK who still sneak looks at him.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Now I'm being followed. The higher ups don't like someone with my powers. In three short minutes, I destroyed a man's business, life, existence. I deleted him.

On the far end of the packed train, a dark-haired man YAWNS loudly. He looks like a disheveled Californian who’s been forced to relocate. He wears cargo pants and what looks like a gas attendant shirt that reads: Computer Repair With A Smile. Below it, a logo reads MR. ROBOT (40s). He looks at Elliot with a stoner’s smile as he brushes his scraggly beard. Elliot doesn’t smile back. Across the crowd of people, the man shouts:

MR. ROBOT: Hey! Hey, you. Hey, kiddo. What's happening?

Elliot doesn’t answer. Instead, he looks away, pretending he didn’t hear him.

MR. ROBOT: Exciting time in the world right now. Exciting time.

Mr. Robot lies on his back, returning to his homeless slumber.

EXT. NYC STREETS - LATER

Elliot walks through the crowded streets of New York, carefully avoiding the touch of other humans. He carries a huge bookbag on his back.

INT. ALLSAFE OFFICES - LATER

He walks into the modest offices of AllSafe Cybersecurity, as announced by the boring, corporate logo.

ELLIOT (V.O.): But I'm only a vigilante hacker by night. By day, just a regular cyber security engineer, employee number ER28-0652.

INT. ALLSAFE OFFICES - GIDEON’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

The AllSafe boss, GIDEON GODDARD (40s), a bearded metrosexual with adult braces stands while ANGELA (20s), a blonde girl-nextdoor trapped in the prim and proper veneer of a private school upbringing, looks at him sternly. Gideon shouts through his glass doors:

GIDEON: Elliot, in here!

[indistinct chatter]

Angela: ...All over the price. Yeah, I can totally, I can totally handle it.

GIDEON: Look--

Elliot nervously walks in, curiously looking at Angela who pretends he’s not even there. Gideon passes a file to him.

GIDEON: They were hacked again. Last night.

ANGELA: Gideon--

ELLIOT (V.O.): That's my childhood friend Angela. She can be a bit high strung sometimes, but trust me she's one of the good ones.

Elliot looks over the notes.

ELLIOT: What am I looking at? Is this the log file? This was a RUDY attack.

Concerned, Gideon nods. Elliot shakes his head, impressed more than he usually is.

ELLIOT: This is awesome.

ANGELA: Gideon, will you please answer me?

GIDEON (to ELLIOT): Awesome? You think this is awesome? This is killing us, Elliot.

ANGELA: Gideon, I'm not leaving--

GIDEON: Angela! Let's just see how this meeting goes today. Their networks are getting attacked every week. Who knows if they'll still even be a client.

ELLIOT: They’re coming in?

Gideon’s look confirms it. He looks at Elliot’s hoodie.

GIDEON: Hey, what did we say about the dress code?

Elliot sheds his hoodie, revealing an oversized, button-downed dress shirt underneath. He hates it.

GIDEON: All right, now, look over those logs. And be ready this afternoon in case they have any questions. Okay?

ANGELA: Okay

INT. ALLSAFE OFFICES - HALLWAYS

Elliot and Angela walk out. Elliot smells something on her.

ELLIOT: Start smoking again?

ANGELA (ignores his question): Did you not get my texts last night? I sent you exactly 13 of them.

ELLIOT: Yeah, I'm sorry. I couldn't make it.

ANGELA (looks at him): You promised me that you were gonna try this time.

FLASHBACK

Last night, Elliot nervously walks up to the entrance of a packed bar. Through the big windows outside he sees Angela, laughing, smiling, drinking with friends. Elliot’s hand goes for the door, but his hand trembles--

ANGELA: Stop thinking about something else when I'm talking to you. I hate when you do that.

ELLIOT: Sorry, I was thinking about work.

ANGELA: Maybe that's why Gideon loves you so much. He thanks me all the time for bringing you in. But for some reason, I think you secretly hate it here.

ELLIOT (V.O.): She was right. I liked most of the people, but our business--a cyber security firm that protects corporations--I can't think of anything I hate more.

ELLIOT: No, I love it here.

Elliot and Angela both chuckle.

ANGELA: I'm sorry. I'm just in a bad mood. I'm late on my last two student loan payments, and I can't get Gideon to give me a raise.

A slick, good-looking white man named OLLIE (20s) walks up and kisses Angela.

OLLIE (to Angela): Hey.

ANGELA (to Ollie): Hi.

OLLIE (to Elliot): Yo, buddy. Missed you last night. Where were you?

ELLIOT: Gotta go, big meeting today.

Elliot doesn’t wait for a response, he disappears into the maze of cubicles quickly.

OLLIE (to Angela): Did you find out what happened?

ANGELA: Yeah. He said he was working.

OLLIE (not buying it): Oh, come on. You gotta talk to him.

ANGELA (rolls her eyes): We’re gonna be late for the staff meeting.

OLLIE: He can't stand me. And you know why. Angela, I can't have that kind of negativity in my life--

Angela glares at him. Ollie points.

OLLIE: That's exactly what I'm talking about.

EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - DAY

Elliot shiftlessly walks through the streets once again, big bookbag in tow. His eyes wander around in paranoia. He continues to eat his McDonald’s fries from the bag.

INT. PSYCHOLOGIST’S OFFICE - DAY

He sits across from his psychologist, KRISTA (30s-40s), a slender African-American woman who tries too hard at youth with a short dress.

They’re looking at each other in silence.

KRISTA: What are you thinking about?

ELLIOT: Nothing.

KRISTA: Wanna know what I’m thinking about? The first time you came to me.

ELLIOT (V.O.): I didn't exactly come to Krista. I was forced here. But I do like her. Hacking her was simple. Her password: Dylan 2791. Favorite artist and the year in which she was born, backwards. Though she's a psychologist, she's really bad at reading people. But I'm good at reading people. My secret: I look for the worst in them.

INSERT: Krista’s Gmail and Facebook. We land on her eHarmony profile.

ELLIOT (V.O): I know she went through a divorce four years ago. I know she was devastated by it and has been dating losers on eHarmony ever since.

INSERT: A profile pic of a salt and pepper handsome gent. He’s a nice fellow with a middle-aged face and a welcoming smile. His name is listed as Michael Hansen.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Her most recent foray Michael Hansen. I searched for him online, but nothing came up. No LinkedIn, no Facebook, nothing. Something about him bugs me, scratching that part of my mind again. But I'll hack him soon enough. I always do.

Back to the scene. Elliot eyes Krista.

KRISTA: I know you're not yelling like before, which is good. But I can tell you're still holding on to it. And we need to work on your anger issues, Elliot. You're angry at everyone, at society--

ELLIOT (V.O.): Fuck society.

KRISTA: I know you have a lot to be angry about, but keeping it to yourself and staying quiet like you're doing it's not going to help you. There's pain underneath. That's where our work needs to go.

Elliot says nothing. Krista leans forward.

KRISTA: What is it about society that disappoints you so much?

Elliot holds back as his eyes wander to the Apple insignia glowing off of Krista’s laptop on her desk.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Oh, I don't know. Is it that we collectively thought Steve Jobs was a great man, even when we knew he made billions off the backs of children?

His eyes shift to the glass framed Tour De France poster hanging on the wall featuring Lance Armstrong.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Or maybe it’s that it feels like all our heroes are counterfeit, the world itself just one big hoax.

His eyes refocus on the reflection of the glass frame, seeing that Krista’s browser from her laptop is on Twitter.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Spamming each other with our running commentary of bullshit masquerading as insight, our social media faking as intimacy.

Krista still eyes Elliot, waiting for him to respond. He returns his stare back at her, noticing the “I voted” sticker on her blouse.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Or is it that we voted for this? Not with our rigged elections--

His eyes now notice the expensive accessories of Krista. Her earrings, watch, shoes, her Hunger Games book in her bag.

ELLIOT (V.O.): But with our things, our property, our money. I'm not saying anything new. We all know why we do this, not because Hunger Games books makes us happy--

Krista crosses her legs, still waiting on Elliot to respond. That’s when Elliot spots a prescription bottle next to Krista’s purse on her desk chair.

ELLIOT (V.O.): But because we wanna be sedated. Because it’s painful not to pretend, because we’re cowards. Fuck society.

KRISTA (echoing): Elliot. You’re not saying anything, what’s wrong?

He finally responds to Krista.

ELLIOT: Nothing.

Krista collects herself, frustrated she’s getting nowhere.

ELLIOT: Don’t be frustrated.

KRISTA (confused): Why shouldn’t I be?

ELLIOT: You’re different than most. You at least try. You at least understand.

KRISTA (intrigued): Understand what?

ELLIOT: What it's like to feel alone. You understand the pain. You want to protect people from it. You want to protect me from it. I respect that about you.

Long silence.

KRISTA: Why do you think I know what it's like to feel alone?

ELLIOT (V.O.): Shit! From her emails!

KRISTA: Elliot?

ELLIOT: I don’t know.

Krista lets it go.

KRISTA: Let's talk about last night. Did you go to Angela's birthday party?

FLASHBACK: Last night, we pick up where we left off. Elliot’s hand trembles as he reaches for the door to the bar. He sweats as he closes his eyes and tries to force himself to go in, but can’t. The door opens, three people file out. Elliot quickly moves out of the way, avoiding physical contact at all costs. He takes a breath and looks through the windows again. Angela is happy, surrounded by friends, enjoying her birthday. Ollie walks up to her. They kiss. This is enough for Elliot to wrap his head in his hoodie and walk away--

Back to the scene.

ELLIOT: Yeah. It was nice.

KRISTA: Did you try to talk to anyone?

ELLIOT: Sure. I got a girl’s number.

KRISTA (impressed): You did?

ELLIOT (chuckles): She’s cute. She likes the Hunger Games.

KRISTA (back to being suspicious): You're hiding again, Elliot. When you hide, your delusions come back. It's a slippery slope. Let's talk about the men in black you've been seeing. Are they still there?

ELLIOT: No, I told you they're gone. The meds you gave me are working.

INT. ALLSAFE OFFICES - CUBICLE - LATER

Elliot types away at his computer. He glances up and notices Ollie approaching.

OLLIE: Yo man. Do you wanna--

Elliot reluctantly takes off his headphones.

OLLIE: Uh, do you wanna do lunch today?

ELLIOT: Uh yeah, I got other plans--

OLLIE: Other plans. Right. That’s what you said the last three times I asked you.

Ollie looks around.

OLLIE: Look, bud, you and Angela have been close for a long time, and that's even more reason why I want us to be on good terms. I - I just I feel like things have been awkward between us. Don't you?

ELLIOT: I’m okay with it being awkward between us.

OLLIE (awkwardly laughs): Um, yeah. I - I - I’m not okay with that.

OLLIE (more sympathetic tone): Um look, man, I love Angela, and I want us to to get along for her sake. I mean, that's what I'm that's what I'm here for. I just, I - I don't normally do stuff

As Ollie drones on again, Elliot’s stream of consciousness interrupts:

ELLIOT (V.O.): Am I that crazy not to like this guy? Among some of his Facebook likes are--

INSERT: Ollie’s Facebook profile and likes.

ELLIOT (V.O.): George W. Bush’s Decision Points, Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen, and the music of Josh Groban. Must I really justify myself any further?

Back to scene.

ELLIOT (V.O.): His was the easiest to hack. Password was 123456Seven.

INSERT: Ollie’s Gmail account.

ELLIOT (V.O.): I witnessed his first ""I love you"" with Angela over Gchat.

INSERT: Profile pic of a trashy woman named Stella B.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Then I witnessed the first of many infidelities with Stella B.

Back to the scene. Ollie’s still in the midst of his phony plea.

OLLIE: ...I've never done anything like this before.

ELLIOT (V.O.): I've thought about telling Angela, but she has shitty taste in men, and I'm not quite ready to see what comes after this just yet.

OLLIE: ...You like music. I like music. Maroon 5.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Plus I can manage Ollie easier than the others. For now, anyway.

OLLIE: And that's all I mean. I just want you to know that. I like you, bro, and I want you to like me too.

ELLIOT: I understand. I’ll try harder.

OLLIE: That's cool, man. Hey, whenever you're ready, I'd love to just...chill--

He puts his arm on Elliot’s shoulder-- but Elliot, not comfortable with the physical contact, shifts his shoulder away.

OLLIE: Oh, forgot about your no touching thing.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Truth is, I shouldn't hate Ollie; he's not that bad a guy. He's too dumb to be bad. In fact, when I think about the really bad people--

As if sensing it, Elliot peeks out of his cubicle. He sees a handful of business SUITS at the front. The SUITS head towards Gideon’s office.

ELLIOT (V.O.): E Corp, the largest conglomerate in the world. They're so big, they're literally everywhere.

E Corp’s logo, which looks like the Enron “E” logo, is shown on all the products inside of the office: desktops, smartphones, laptops.

ELLIOT (V.O.): A perfect monster of modern society. The E might as well stand for Evil.

An advertisement plays on a television and displays some of E Corp’s ventures. Agriculture, electronics, medicine, construction.

ELLIOT (V.O.): In fact, after a thorough, intensive self-reprogramming, that's all my mind hears, sees, or reads when they pop up in my world.

INSERT: E Corp advertisement.

WOMAN: That's what we have to offer. Together, we can change the world with E Corp--

INSERT: Replace E Corp logo with Evil Corp logo

ELLIOT (V.O.):  Krista would have a shit fit if she knew I did that. But that’s what they are...a conglomerate of evil. And now I have to help them.

Gideon and the team of SUITS walk up next to Elliot’s cubicle.

GIDEON: There are six on-site engineers on your account. Plus a few off-site.

Elliot sneaks a peek at the head suit, Steve Ballmer with a full mane of hair.

ELLIOT (V.O.): There he is, Terry Colby, the CTO.

TERRY COLBY looks around with a doofus smile.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Even though he's the head technology guy at one of the biggest companies in the world, he owns a Blackberry.

Elliot’s eyes shift to Terry’s Blackberry on his belt. Terry looks at Elliot’s desktop with confusion.

ELLIOT (V.O.): But also looks like he doesn't see a terminal very often. He's not a techie. He's a moron.

The suits, led by Gideon, keep on walking through the office.

ELLIOT (V.O.): An arrogant moron. The worst kind.

Elliot focuses on his terminal, but a person from the pack walks up to him. He’s good-looking, sharply dressed and has a rock star smile. His name is TYRELL WELLICK (30s). He reaches his hand out to Elliot. Elliot painfully takes it.

TYRELL (thick Swedish accent): Oh, hi. Tyrell Wellick. I'm Senior Vice President, Technology.

ELLIOT: I’m...Elliot. Just a tech.

TYRELL: Don't be so humble. You know, I started out exactly where you are, and to be honest, you know, my heart is still there. [looking at his screen] So I see you're running Gnome. You know, I'm actually on KDE myself. I know this desktop environment is supposed to be better but you know what they say. Old habits they die hard.

ELLIOT (V.O.): An executive running Linux with--

TYRELL: Yeah, I know what you're thinking. I'm an executive. I mean why am I even running Linux? Again old habits. It's gonna be fun working with you. I should join the rest of the group. Bonsoir, Elliot.

He takes off with an earnest smile.

Elliot sits back down in his cubicle with a resigned sigh. He takes in his small three-walled cube universe amidst the thirty other identical cubes.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Sometimes I dream of saving the world.

His eyes look over at Lloyd who is busy paying a Verizon bill online.

ELLIOT(V.O.): Saving everyone from the invisible hand, one that brands us with an employee badge.

Elliot eyes his fellow employees sympathetically, all looking like enslaved serfs with their company badges hanging off them.

EXT. NYC STREETS - NIGHT

Elliot walks through the streets alone as GROUPS OF FRIENDS laugh while walking in and out of bars. Credit cards are swiped, dollar-tips are thrown, a homeless man begs for change.

ELLIOT (V.O.): The one that forces us to work for them. The one that controls us every day without us knowing it. But I can’t stop it. I’m not that special.

INT. ELLIOT’S LOFT - NIGHT

Elliot enters his messy small loft.

ELLIOT (V.O.): I'm just anonymous. I'm just alone.

Elliot makes his way over to a fishbowl, swimming inside is a black fish named QWERTY.

ELLIOT (V.O.): If it weren't for Qwerty, I'd be completely empty.

MOMENTS LATER

ELLIOT (V.O.): I hate when I can't hold in my loneliness. This crying has been happening too often, every other week now. What do normal people do when they get this sad? They reach out to friends or family, I think.

INT. ELLIOT’S HOUSE (FLASHBACK) - DAY

A YOUNG ELLIOT (8) sits at the kitchen table. His MOTHER (30s), pretty but cold. Buttoned up, a short haircut, and expressionless face. She methodically smokes a cigarette. Young Elliot looks like he’s been scolded. His mother grabs his arms and slams them down on the table.

ELLIOT (V.O.) : That’s not an option.

INT. ELLIOT’S LOFT - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Elliot crushes up morphine pills. He puts the crushed powder on a small glass table and cuts it with a credit card.

ELLIOT (V.O.): I do morphine.

INT. ELLIOT’S LOFT - MOMENTS LATER

Elliot snorts up a line of morphine. He lies back down on the floor as it takes effect. He sprawls out on his couch, staring at Qwerty as it takes effect.

ELLIOT (V.O.): The key to doing morphine without turning into a junkie is to limit yourself to 30 milligrams a day. Anything more just builds up your tolerance. I check every pill I get for purity. I have 8 milligram Suboxone for maintenance in case I go through withdrawals--

Elliot’s eyes shift from Qwerty to an empty prescription bottle.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Shit! I’m out again.

He reaches out for it in disbelief.

MOMENTS LATER

SHAYLA (20s), a hipster girl, steps into the room. She slides an orange bottle full of pills.

ELLIOT: How much?

SHAYLA: On the house.

ELLIOT: No Shayla, not doing that. Okay? This is just a regular drug deal, like it always is.

Elliot offers her cash. Shayla resigns herself and takes it.

SHAYLA: So what are you you to tonight? 'Cause I tried to post something on your Facebook and couldn't find you.

ELLIOT: I’m not on Facebook.

SHAYLA: What? Why not?

ELLIOT: ‘Cause I hate Facebook.

SHAYLA (offended): That’s crazy.

Elliot shoots her a look, “I guess I’m crazy.” Disappointed, Shayla playfully pulls out two white pills from her pocket.

SHAYLA: Well you want to do these together then? Pure Molly.

The last line piques Elliot’s interest, though his look is already regretting the decision.

INT. ELLIOT’S LOFT - LATER

Elliot lies naked in his bed, smoking a joint, while a nude Shayla lies next to him, fast asleep. He wears a dumb look.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Don't ever make decisions when you're on morphine.

His cell beeps. He looks at it.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Instagram check-in for Krista at Pierre Loti. Okay, Michael Hansen. Time to find out who you really are.

EXT. PIERRE LOTI - NIGHT

Elliot, in a hoodie, walks by Pierre Loti across the street. He doesn’t walk towards it, instead he stays put, lurking around the corner.

Elliot looks around the city block he’s standing on. In the distance, a late night diner shows two MEN IN BLACK having coffee. Elliot hides in the shadows, watching them.

EXT. PIERRE LOTI - AWHILE LATER

Elliot’s spies Michael from across the street as he watches him kiss Krista goodbye. They part ways.

Michael hails a cab. Elliot snaps a picture of the number on top of Michael’s cab as it takes off. He quickly pulls out his cell phone and dials.

ELLIOT (into the phone): Uh, hi I just left my keys in one of your cabs. 56Y2. Sure.

Suddenly, the MR. ROBOT bum from the subway walks up to their table, begging for money. Elliot shoots a confused look-- but gets interrupted when the operator returns.

ELLIOT: 306 Hawthorne. Thank you. Thank you.

He hangs up and returns his gaze back to the two MEN IN BLACK. Mr. Robot is nowhere to be seen. He lets it go for now and returns to the task at hand.

EXT. 306 HAWTHORNE AVENUE - LATER

Elliot walks up and sees the cab, waiting by the curb. On the stoop in front of 306 Hawthorne, Michael begrudgingly walks his dog. It’s as if Michael has completely dropped his cheery, nice guy act.

MICHAEL: Come on, asshole, piss already! Come on!

He jerks the dog by his leash, causing him to YELP.

Elliot charges from across the street.

The cowed dog looks up sheepishly at Michael as it nervously paces around the small patch of grass.

MICHAEL: Come on! Will you will you go? - Come on, go, go!

He yanks the dog into the air by the leash, when Elliot finally gets there--

ELLIOT: Hey!

MICHAEL: Go, will ya?

The dog yelps again.

ELLIOT: Hey!

Michael stops and turns. Elliot looks at the dog with sympathy, but then back at Michael.

ELLIOT: May I borrow your phone? Mine's dead. I need to call my mom.

Michael reluctantly nods and pulls out his cell. He slides it unlocked with his passcode and hands it to him.

ELLIOT: Thank you.

Elliot takes it, immediately memorizing all the apps on his homescreen, specifically the E Corp app.

He dials his own number and calls. From within Elliot’s back pocket, we see his phone light up and vibrate.

Elliot gets his own voicemail. He hangs up, quickly deletes his call log and looks back at Michael.

ELLIOT: No answer. Thanks anyway.

Michael takes his phone back with a shrug.

EXT. NYC SUBWAY - LATER

Elliot walks out of the subway station, smoking a joint. His phone immediately vibrates. He looks at it with a question, then answers.

ELLIOT: Angela, is everything okay?

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. ALLSAFE OFFICES - CUBICLE

Angela stands apart from Lloyd, who is desperately trying to tackle a tech issue on his desktop.

ANGELA (into the phone, discreet): I need you to come to AllSafe.

ELLIOT: You're there? It's three in the morning.

ANGELA: They attacked Evil Corp servers again, but it's bad this time. It's a DDoS attack.

ELLIOT: Did you call Lloyd? He's on call.

ANGELA: Yeah, he's here.

ELLIOT: Is he talking to their tech department?

ANGELA: He's online with them, but so far nothing. I don't think that Lloyd can handle this. Look, Gideon just put me on this account. I can't screw up in my first week. I need you. Please.

Elliot looks back into the subway. He tosses his joint.

INT. ALLSAFE OFFICES - NIGHT

Elliot races in. Angela walks up to him, panicking.

ANGELA: Finally!

ELLIOT: Calm down, it’s only been an hour.

ANGELA: Yeah, well, an hour in Evil Corp time is like $13 million in revenue, approximately. Actually, I calculated that. That's exactly how much they lost.

ELLIOT: Don’t worry, I got you.

They approach Lloyd who is sweating bullets in his cubicle.

ELLIOT: Lloyd, what’s up?

No response, Lloyd is locked in on his terminal.

LLOYD: Elliot. This is bad. Worst DDoS attack I've ever seen.

ELLIOT: Did you reconfigure the DNS?

LLOYD: Yes!

ELLIOT: Stop the services.

LLOYD: I already stopped the services, tries to reboot the servers but they're not coming back up. Dude, someone is straight up fingerblasting their entire network right now.

Elliot types furiously on his desktop, navigating Evil Corp’s
servers.

Angela checks her phone.

ANGELA: They just started reporting on the outage.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Shit. This is worse than I thought. They’re in the network.

Elliot types away as Gideon walks in. Even though he’s angry, he keeps his cool. He sees Elliot, then faces Angela.

GIDEON: What's the status update? See here. I thought we set up security protocols - so that this doesn't happen. Where’s the attack coming from?

ELLIOT: Everywhere, obviously. - The USA, Finland, Thailand, Kuwait--

GIDEON: Start restarting the services, load sharing, redirect the traffic--and call Prolexic for help.

ELLIOT: Wait.

GIDEON: What?

ELLIOT: I don't think this is just a DDoS attack. I think they got a rootkit sitting inside the servers.

ANGELA: What’s a rootkit?

LLOYD: It's like a crazy serial rapist with a very big dick.

ANGELA: Jesus, Lloyd!

LLOYD: Sorry. It's malicious code that completely takes over their system. It can delete system files and stop programs. Viruses, worms--

ANGELA: How do we stop it?

LLOYD: That's the thing. It's fundamentally invisible you can't stop it. All of their servers are timing out. None of them are coming back up.

Elliot moves to Lloyd’s terminal to check something.

ELLIOT: That's because every time we restart the server the virus replicates itself during boot up and crashes the host.

LLOYD: How are we supposed to bring up the network if we can't restart the servers?

ELLIOT: We can't. Which is what they wanted. By defending ourselves, we ended up spreading the virus everywhere.

Everyone exchanges tense looks. Gideon tries to contain himself as he already knows what follows.

ELLIOT: Only thing we can do is we've gotta take the whole system offline, wipe the infected servers clean, then bring them back up.

GIDEON: You’re coming with me.

ELLIOT (whispers): Yeah.

GIDEON: Lloyd. Tell everybody to start taking everything offline.

LLOYD: Got it.

GIDEON (on the phone): Uh, the server farm in Dulles. We're gonna need the jet.

EXT. PRIVATE JET - NIGHT

Gideon and Elliot speed walk towards a slick black sedan already waiting for them.

INT. SERVER FARM - NIGHT

Elliot speed-walks into the loud WHIRRING of the large arrays of servers.

GIDEON: They're booting the network back up. Now, you're downloading the logs, right because--

ELLIOT: Stop. Tell him to stop.

GIDEON: What?

ELLIOT: Don't start the boot sequence. You guys missed one. There's an infected server up and running.

Elliot moves to the server display and points out  cs 30.

ELLIOT: What's the ETA before it hits this server? (Elliot)The backup server up and running?

A spectating TECH nervously stares at the display and then Elliot before shrugging.

Elliot returns to the console and starts to furiously type.

ELLIOT: The backup server up and running?

TECH: It's ready, but it's not configured for auto switch.

Elliot races towards the backup server, cs51. He finds it terminals in.

ELLIOT: We need to redirect the traffic, need to switch DNS.

The displays shows that the network is slowly coming back online, approaching the still-infected server, cs30.

GIDEON: This is impossible.

ELLIOT: You got this, you got this, you got this.

As Elliot continues to type, nearly all the servers but cs30 and cs51 have come back online. He manages to switch the DNS to cs51 at the last second.

ELLIOT: We still up?

Gideon holds his breath and watches as the network boots up the backup server and then the remaining ones before letting it all out.

GIDEON: We’re okay.

ELLIOT: Yeah.

Gideon squats down to Elliot with a huge grin on his face. He proudly squeezes Elliot’s shoulder. Elliot shies away from the contact.

ELLIOT: I'm gonna take a look at the infected server, okay? Give me a minute.

GIDEON (put off): Yeah. Uh I'll meet you at the elevators.

The spectators disperse along with Gideon. Elliot continues to furiously type.

ELLIOT (V.O.): They must have left a mark or something. Every hacker loves attention. They don't just do DDoS attacks for no reason.

That’s when Elliot stumbles upon a data file in the terminal that reads simply: fsociety00.

ELLIOT (V.O.): This is it. Fsociety. Is that supposed to be a joke? This was way too easy. They didn't hide it well at all.

He /dir’s it and a flurry of files go flying by, the last one being README.TXT. He opens it. It reads simply: leavemehere.

ELLIOT (V.O.): This note is for me. They're telling me to leave it here. But why? Doesn't matter. Time to shut them down.

Elliot can’t bring himself to delete the rootkit.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Why can't I delete it? I don't want to delete it. I want it to stay. What's wrong with me?

Elliot nervously looks around before he cancels the delete command.

ELLIOT (V.O.): I'll reconfigure the access to the root directory so only I can use it. And no one will know.

INT. PRIVATE JET (MOVING) - DAWN

Exhausted, Elliot and Gideon sit silently together. Though Elliot is used to the all-nighters, Gideon isn’t. He has a glass of wine as he sits back, deep in thought.

GIDEON: Did you know that I'm gay?

ELLIOT: Um...no.

After an awkward pause, Gideon uncomfortably nods.

GIDEON: Consider this me coming out to you then, okay? It's hard because I don't like to talk about my sex life. But my partner, he gets very paranoid. He thinks I'm ashamed of-- he wants me to be more public about it. So. Anyway, I'm gay.

ELLIOT (awkward pause): Thanks.

Gideon: Yeah.

Deep in thought again, Gideon takes a deep breath. Elliot notices the troubled look on his face.

ELLIOT: Hey, man, don't worry about it. Hackers have a short attention span. They'll get bored, harass someone else--

GIDEON: Evil Corp is thinking about leaving us. And I don't know if I can blame them...

Gideon takes another sip of his wine and leans back in his chair. He shakes his head.

ELLIOT: They could have called their other security teams.

GIDEON: Mm.

ELLIOT: They called you.

GIDEON: Well, somebody over there likes us, but Terry Colby, he's getting the pressure. And he calls the shots. Evil Corp is 80% of our business. If we lose them, it's gonna be it for us. It's gonna be it--for me.

They both sit in silence for a moment. Gideon looks over.

GIDEON: I feel like I can talk to you. I mean, more than the others, anyway.

They share a comfortable moment this time.

GIDEON: I'm sure, in a weird way, you'll be happy if we went under. Oh, come on. Come on. I know you hate wearing those stupid shirts.

ELLIOT: Gideon? I promise I'll find them.

INT. NYC SUBWAY (MOVING) - DAY

Elliot’s drained face stares stoically out, trying to piece together the mystery of the recent hacks.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Evil Corp service should be back up soon enough. I'll take a look at the dat file. I'll ask my IRC contacts about fsociety when I get home. I've never seen their name on the boards though. They've gotta be new, but they're good--

Elliot’s train of thought is interrupted when Mr. Robot sits across from him, donning the same gas attendant shirt.

MR. ROBOT: Rough night?

Shocked, Elliot’s eyes grow large.

MR. ROBOT: I'm getting off here. I think you should come with me. But only if you didn't delete it. You deleted it, we got nothing to talk about.

Mr. Robot stands and waits by the doors. Elliot sits there, paralyzed, not knowing what to do at all.

ELLIOT: Are you talking to me?

Mr. Robot says nothing, but the empty car states the obvious. The subway finally screeches to a halt. Elliot reamins seated as it stops. Mr. Robot walks off the subway. Elliot sits there for a moment, wondering if he should follow him as the doors close. He does.

PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS

Mr. Robot sits on the other side of the station. Elliot slowly walks over and sits next to him.

ELLIOT: Who are you?

MR. ROBOT: We gotta wait for the Q.

ELLIOT: Then what?

MR. ROBOT: Then we're going to Brooklyn. Out by Coney Island.

ELLIOT: Why? What’s there.

Mr. Robot is silent for a moment, taking a deep breath as he looks at Elliot.

MR. ROBOT: Obviously you're gonna ask a lot of questions. It's weird what you're doing right now, I get it. I-I can't tell you anything until we get there.

Mr. Robot pulls out a cigarette and lights it.

ELLIOT: Can't smoke in here.

Mr. Robot ignores him.

ELLIOT: You've been following me. Why? What do you want from me?

MR. ROBOT: My dad was a petty thief. Never could hold down a job. So, he just robbed, convenience stores, shops, small-time stuff. One time, he sat me down, he told me something I never forgot. He said, ""Everyone steals. That's how it works. You think people out there are getting exactly what they deserve? No. They're getting paid over or under, but someone in the chain always gets bamboozled. I steal, son, but I don't get caught. That's my contract with society. Now if you can catch me stealing, I'll go to jail. But if you can't, then I've earned the money. "" I respected that, man. I thought that shit was cool as a little kid. A few years after that, they finally caught him. Sent him to jail. Dies five years later. My respect goes with him. I thought he was free doing what he did, but he wasn't. He was in prison. Just like you are now, Elliot. But I'm gonna break you out.

Elliot shoots him a quiet, puzzled look. Mr. Robot puts on a pair of sunglasses, smiles big and then stares ahead.

EXT. CONEY ISLAND - STREETS - DAY

An impoverished, ghetto block. Elliot cautiously follows Mr. Robot down the street. An old Ferris wheel can be seen slowly spinning in the distance.

They finally reach a rundown, closed up arcade. The sign reads: FUN SOCIETY ARCADE (but the U and N are missing/faded). Robot walks up to the back door, gesturing Elliot to follow him.

THE BACK - CONTINUOUS

Mr. Robot opens the backdoor. Blue, green, and gray Ethernet cables run from all sides of the door. The sound of KEYBOARD STROKES emanates from within. ROMERO (50s) - a long, gray-haired hippie with a fanny pack - opens the door. He looks over Elliot before going back inside. Mr. Robot walks in. Elliot follows.

INT. FSOCIETY ARCADE - CONTINUOUS

An arcade with very little working games left. Using fallen games as tables for computers, four hackers type away: MOBLEY (30s) - an obese man with shaggy hair. TRENTON (16) - a Muslim girl hunched over at a terminal. DARLENE (20s) - an aggressive yet striking hipster who chain smokes. She wears a fur coat and blue Ray Bans.

ELLIOT: Why would you guys actually meet IRL?

None of them look up, all of them with earbuds plugged in as they type away. Silence fills the room. Mr. Robot gestures for Elliot to follow him around the corner, into the center of the arcade.

MR. ROBOT: You remember that hacker group O-Megz? They got outed by their own leader to the FBI, and six hackers went to prison for it? You know how they got 'em?

Mr. Robot walks over to the popcorn machine and starts eating straight out of it.

MR. ROBOT: They went on the dude's computer, tracked 'em all down through emails, VPN sessions, chat messages, texts. One guy, and the whole thing comes down. It's what's called--

ELLIOT: A central point of failure.

MR. ROBOT: Right. Because they refused to meet in person, they compromised each other every time they sent so much as a smiley face. The rule here is, it's done here, and only here. It ends when you walk out that door, and begins when you walk in. Our encryption is the real world.

ELLIOT: How do you talk to each other then?

Mr. Robot walks over to the kitchen sink and pours himself water from the tap.

MR. ROBOT: We don't. We come and go, work on the project when we can.

ELLIOT (discreet): How do you trust them?

MR. ROBOT: How do you trust them? - I give them an exercise. If they pass, they join us. If they fail...

ELLIOT: The DDoS attack last night...you were testing me.

Mr. Robot takes off his jacket as he sits down and smiles yes. Elliot peers back to the hackers.

ELLIOT: You said there was a project.

MR. ROBOT (nods):That'll come later. I just wanted you to see the place.

Mr. Robot starts typing away. Elliot stands there, unsure of how to proceed.

MR. ROBOT: There's not much you can do without a CPU.

INT. NYC SUBWAY (MOVING) - MORNING

A visibly unnerved Elliot sits in silence.

ELLIOT (V.O.): I'm crazy. I have to be crazy because that didn't just happen, right? This is a delusion. Is this a delusion? Shit, I'm a schizo.

INT. NYC STREETS - DAY

Elliot doesn’t walk the streets so carefully this time, as his mind swims in the mystery of what he just witnessed.

ELLIOT: Have I really lost it this time? No, no. Last night happened. It was real. Angela called me. I was at AllSafe. Evil Corp's servers were compromised. Those are facts, not delusions. I know. I know, I know I realize I'm saying all of this to an imaginary person, but I created you. I didn't create this.

EXT. ELLIOT’S APARTMENT BUILDING - STEPS - DAY

Elliot walks to his building and sees Angela sitting outside on the steps, waiting for him. She stands when she sees him.

ANGELA: Oh, thank God you're here. I was just about to go wait in the Starbucks. You live in a bad neighborhood. Do you know that?

ELLIOT: I do know that.

She shows him a BACK TO THE FUTURE II DVD.

ANGELA: Do you want to get high and watch your favorite movie? Oh, you saved our asses last night. I thought Gideon was definitely gonna fire me. Where have you been? I thought you'd be sleeping.

ELLIOT: I--yeah, I fell asleep on the train.

ANGELA (skeptical): That sounds like such a lie, but, whatever. I don't want to get into that right now. So you want to do this? I miss Qwerty, I hope she still loves me.

INT. ELLIOT’S LOFT

Elliot unlocks the door and they walk into the apartment. They share an awkward moment as they see Shayla, naked, asleep on Elliot’s bed.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Shit.

ELLIOT: She wasn't supposed to be here, okay? - Give me a minute and I'll get rid of her.

ANGELA: That’s okay. Um...this is great. Elliot, I’m happy for you.

ELLIOT: No, it’s not like that.

ANGELA: Well, maybe it should be, you know? It's good that you're dating.

Elliot reluctantly nods in defeat.

ANGELA: Well, I'll see you on Monday. We can do movie night next time. I promise, okay?

ELLIOT: Yeah.

ANGELA: Have fun.

Elliot nods as she walks out the door. Frustrated, he opens the door and slams it shut to wake Shayla.

Shayla stirs awake as he walks towards the bed.

SHAYLA: Elliot? Oh, shit. Is it Wednesday?

ELLIOT: Shayla--

SHAYLA: I have to move my car.

ELLIOT: Shayla, leave. NOW.

INT. ELLIOT’S LOFT - DAY

INSERT: Google, 4chan, message boards, blogs, news sites, etc.

ELLIOT (V.O.): No mention of Mr. Robot anywhere. No mention of fsociety. Not on any of the hacker boards. Not on IRC, forums, blogs, no one's heard of them.

INSERT: Google maps on the fsociety arcade.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Property was owned by Fun Society Amusement, LLC for 13 years. Owner was shot a killed a year and a half ago. No owner since. And the ownership history before that is sparse to nonexistent. This guy is good. Very good. Doesn't matter. Their arcade network's IP is in the dat file. That'll be enough to turn them in.

Elliot prints out the incriminating pages and files them in a blue manila envelope. Elliot sits back down, looking at the Google Maps picture of the fsociety arcade. The temptation is too strong, he cracks.

ELLIOT (V.O.): What’s your ask, Mr. Robot?

EXT. CONEY ISLAND STREETS - LATER

Elliot, carrying his bulky bookbag, walks through the slums of Coney Island, back to the fsociety arcade.

Outside, Darlene stands outside the back door and smokes. She has the thick fur coat on to protect her from the cold air.

Elliot enters through the metal gate and walks up to her. She doesn’t say anything to him.

ELLIOT: Hey man, where’s your boss?

Darlene shoots him an odd look.

DARLENE: Okay, cut the bullshit. When are you going to give us access to the root directory?

ELLIOT: What?

DARLENE: Dude, come on. I wrote that rootkit. I still have to put Colby's IP in the .dat file.

Darlene shakes her head with disgust and flicks her cigarette.

DARLENE: Dickhead.

She walks towards the back door, leaving Elliot perplexed. Mr. Robot enters from the street, holding a grocery bag full of goodies.

MR. ROBOT: Elliot! Good news. I scored the last bag of Twinkies from Gristedes. You want one?

ELLIOT: She just called me a dickhead.

MR. ROBOT (smiles): Yeah, that's Darlene.

Mr. Robot gestures towards the Ferris wheel.

MR. ROBOT: Hey, you like Ferris wheels?

EXT. CONEY ISLAND - FERRIS WHEEL - DAY

Elliot and Mr. Robot stand in a slow-moving, empty Ferris wheel car as it does its circular motion up. Mr. Robot looks down at the abandoned area with a grin, eating a twinkie.

MR. ROBOT: Ah, it's beautiful. Gets better the higher up you go, you know? Oh, I love it up here. You like it?

ELLIOT: I'm here to tell you I'm turning you in. I'm giving them all the information--

MR. ROBOT: Let me tell you why you're really here.

Confused, Elliot says nothing.

MR. ROBOT: You're here because you sense something wrong with the world. Something you can't explain. But you know it controls you and everyone you care about.

ELLIOT: What are you talking about?

MR. ROBOT: Money. Money hasn't been real since we got off the gold standard. It's become virtual. Software. The operating system of our world. And, Elliot, we are on the verge of taking down this virtual reality. Think about it. What if you could take down one conglomerate? A conglomerate so deeply entrenched in the world's economy, that too big to fail doesn’t even come close to describing it.

ELLIOT: You want to create another financial meltdown like the one we just had, but way worse. Yeah, why would I want that? Everyone would lose their money.

MR. ROBOT: What if I told you that this conglomerate just so happens to own 70% of the global consumer credit industry? Huh? If we hit their data center just right, we could systematically format all the servers, including backup.

ELLIOT: That would erase all--

MR. ROBOT: All the debt we owe them. Every record of every credit card, loan, and mortgage would be wiped clean. It would be impossible to reinforce outdated paper records. It would all be gone. The single biggest incident of wealth redistribution in history.

Elliot realizes what he’s talking about. To underline this, he sees an Evil Corp logo proudly displayed on top of a building in the horizon.

ELLIOT: Evil Corp. The conglomerate. That's why you picked me. Because I work at AllSafe.

Mr. Robot reaches into a pocket and pulls out a slip of paper with an IP address.

MR. ROBOT: Tomorrow, AllSafe is going to get a visit from the FBI and the U. S. Cyber Command. You are going to modify the dat file and put Colby's terminal IP address in there.

ELLIOT: Terry Colby? You're gonna frame him? No one's gonna believe that. I met him, he's a moron.

MR. ROBOT: So are the FBI. Even if they don't believe he did it, they'll believe he gave someone access to it.

ELLIOT: Yeah, he'll just go to jail. What good will that do?

MR. ROBOT: You don't take down a conglomerate by shooting them in the heart. That's the thing about conglomerates, they don't have hearts. You take them down limb by limb. And as they unravel, their illusion of control unravels.

Elliot takes a hard look at Mr. Robot, questioning his seemingly altruistic motives.

ELLIOT: Who are you?

Mr. Robot takes out a cigarette.

MR. ROBOT: That'll come later. Right now, you have a lot to think about. You have to change the dat file and put Colby's IP in there. You do that, you have set in motion the largest revolution the world will ever see.

Elliot’s look of doubt is all but whittled away.

Neil Diamond’s “If You Go Away” plays

”If you go away on this summer day”

INT. NYC SUBWAY STATION (MOVING) - NIGHT

Elliot can’t contain the flurry of emotions as they flash across his face.

Sensing Elliot’s excitement, a CHILD smiles at him. Touched, Elliot smiles back.

Elliot notices an E Corp advertisement on the subway wall about student debt. He stops and stares.

INT. ELLIOT’S LOFT - NIGHT

”And the moon stood still for the nightbird song”

Elliot skips around multiple pages on his computer. He’s on Angela’s Facebook page before looking over her bank statements and private E Corp student loans.  She owes $197,455.64.

Elliot types away on his computer, we see text as he’s skipping around. NY TIMES - Debt Slavery, The New American Dream. BBC - The global gap between rich and poor is at its highest level for 20 years and growing. HuffPost - Mortgage lenders now have more equity in U.S. homes than Americans.

Elliot looks over at Mr. Robot’s slip of paper next to him. He opens a new command-line and begins typing up the report.

MOMENTS LATER

The final pages of the new diagnostic report prints out. He places the report and a CD in a blue manila envelope. He pauses as he places it next to the white envelope he prepared earlier.

INT. NYC STREETS - NEXT MORNING

”If you go away, as I know you must”

The MEN IN BLACK on the sidewalk sneak Elliot looks. Elliot’s excitement from the night before starts a slow descent.

As Elliot walks to the subway, he stares at a poster for a blockbuster movie called VILLAINS, the tagline reads: Evil Always Wins.

INT. ALLSAFE OFFICES - CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

”Like the empty look I see on your face”

Gideon, Elliot, Lloyd, Angela, AllSafe account executives, FBI, and Evil Corp execs cramp the conference table. He nervously glances around the room, tensing up as Terry Colby and Tyrell Wellick walk in. Disappointedly, he pulls out the white envelope

The song stops playing after “Till your next hello/If you go away...”

TERRY COLBY: So, what do we got?

GIDEON: So, if you'll take a look at the first page of your agenda--

Everyone flips over one page of their packet. Terry looks over at Elliot. Elliot nervously looks back.

TERRY COLBY: You're the one who stopped the hack. You know, the gals in analysis said this was a tough one. All things being equal, it should have shut us down for days. So you did good.

ELLIOT (uncomfortable): Okay.

GIDEON: We should start with our account executive, Angela.

ANGELA: Okay, we first noticed the breach at 2:07 A.M. Eastern Standard on Friday night--

TERRY COLBY: You mean, Saturday?

ANGELA: Sorry, yes, technically, Saturday morning.

TERRY COLBY (condescending): Yeah, okay, Angela, that's what we're here for. The technicals.

Noting the condescension, Angela hides her anger.

ANGELA: Anyway, he arrived at the office at 2:35 and I instruct--

TERRY COLBY: Okay, wait, wait, wait. So that's almost a half hour after the initial breach. Why didn't anyone pipe in from their laptops?

ANGELA: It’s not protocol--

ELLIOT: It wouldn't have been secure if someone terminaled in on this. It was the smarter move to have someone come in - so they can log in on a secure line.

ANGELA (annoyed): Exactly. Then Lloyd was able to--

TERRY COLBY: Just--just actually, just one second.

Terry gestures to Tyrell. Tyrell leans in and Terry whispers something in his ear. Tyrell exchanges a glance with Gideon and they step outside the conference room. From the look on Gideon’s face, it’s not good. Angela looks like she’s gonna flip out.

TERRY COLBY: You know, I, uh, I always loved this view.

After the brief exchange, Gideon returns to Angela’s side, collects her papers, and walks her out of the conference room.

TERRY COLBY (to Elliot): Now that that's taken care of, let's pick it up where we left off.

ELLIOT: What happened to Angela? She knows more about what happened.

TERRY COLBY: She's not going to work out for us, not on this level. We need to stick to the more tech savvy here.

Elliot’s eyes shift back and forth between the embarrassed Angela who is walking down the hallway, the blue manila envelope still in his bag and Terry Colby’s curious look. Elliot instantly gains courage. He swaps the white manila for the blue.

Tyrell notes the envelope exchange.

TERRY COLBY: Now, let's get to the heart of this thing because I can't sit here and look through a packet for the next 20 minutes. All right, just who did this? Is it that hard? Who did this?

ELLIOT: I found the configuration file of the rootkit with a pattern of IP addresses. Once you decrypt it, you'll know where the hack came from.

CUT TO BLACK

FADE IN

INT. ELLIOT’S LOFT - MORNING

Elliot hasn’t slept and it shows. He checks his laptop and quickly searches around news blogs and hacker boards. His face falls. He checks his phone: 0 results.

ELLIOT (V.O.): 19 days. No news, no arrests, no revolution.

EXT. NYC STREETS - LATER

Elliots moves through the crowd, avoiding contact as usual.

INT. ALLSAFE OFFICES - DAY

Elliot looks over the cubicles at work, everything seems to be normal as ever.

ELLIOT (V.O.): No FBI, Colby, Evil Corp.

EXT. CONEY ISLAND - DAY

Elliot walks by the fsociety arcade, but it’s abandoned. No wires, no hackers, no Mr. Robot.

ELLIOT (V.O.): No Mr. Robot. No fsociety.

Elliot walks back to his apartment building.

ELLIOT (V.O.): I need to take my mind off things.

MOMENTS LATER

INT. ELLIOT’S LOFT - DAY

INSERT: Krista’s Facebook, Gmail, eHarmony profile, Michael’s eHarmony profile.

MICHAEL (Off Screen): Hello?

ELLIOT: Hi, this is Sam from Bank of E security fraud department. Unfortunately I have to inform you that your account's been compromised.

MICHAEL (O.S.): What? What happened?

ELLIOT: First before I can answer any questions, I need to verify some information. Are you still at 306 Hawthorne Avenue?

MICHAEL (O.S.): Yes. Apartment 2C.

ELLIOT: Great.

Elliot inputs keywords based on Michael’s responses for his command line program to run password checks with.

ELLIOT: And your security question, favorite baseball team?

MICHAEL (O.S.): Um, Yankees. I don't remember this being a security question--

ELLIOT: And lastly, your pet's name?

MICHAEL (O.S.): Um, Flipper. Who am I speaking to? Can I get your name and number--

Elliot disconnects and focuses on his command line program.

ELLIOT (V.O.): With those details plus a dictionary brute-force attack, it'll take my program maybe two minutes to crack his password.

While he waits, Elliot goes on Facebook and looks up Angela. He scans through the pictures of her and Ollie. Christmas vacations, Halloween, beach parties, barbecues, etc.

ELLIOT (V.O.): What I wouldn't give to be normal. To live in that bubble, the reality of the naive.

He switches Facebook accounts to Krista, his therapist. More happy pictures.

ELLIOT (V.O.): That's how I justify this. To keep their optimism intact. To protect them.

His password program BEEPS. He switches screens hurriedly and discovers the program didn’t come up with a single match.

ELLIOT (V.O.): How? He's too old to have a complicated password. It had to have been a combination of these things.

Elliot puts his head down and thinks.

ELLIOT (V.O.): I'm missing something, I'm missing something, I'm missing something. Michael Hansen isn't his real name.

He slouches as he rocks back and forth in his chair. He looks up, realizing what he missed.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Michael Hansen isn’t his real name.

EXT. 306 HAWTHORNE AVENUE - NIGHT

Michael walks down his street pushing a baby in a stroller. His WIFE walks next to him. They exchange words before she heads into the corner convenience store and he walks towards their apartment building, still pushing the stroller. We now see he’s also walking Flipper, his dog. Elliot sits on his stoop, in his hoodie, smoking a cigarette, waiting for him.

Elliot’s silhouette takes Michael by surprise.

ELLIOT: Lenny Shannon? Michael Hansen? Which one are you playing tonight? You're going to stop seeing Krista.

The sound of her name immediately makes Michael’s eyes grow wide. Elliot stands and faces him.

MICHAEL: What the fu--

ELLIOT: You're going to break up with her. You're never going to see her again.

MICHAEL (recognizing him): You're the guy that used my phone--

ELLIOT: You cheated on your current wife with seven different women. I got digital proof of all of it.

Stunned, Michael remains still. His wife stands in line at the checkout.

ELLIOT: Ashley Madison, online escorts, fake Facebook pages. I own it all. And if you don't stop seeing her, your wife will know everything along with the police.

MICHAEL: The police?

ELLIOT: Yeah, one of the escorts was 15.

Elliot shows Michael a picture of one of the escorts. Michael puts his head down with a wince.

ELLIOT (V.O.): That 15 part I made up, but he did have a proclivity for young escorts that helped the lie.

ELLIOT: But I'm not gonna do any of that as long as you break up with Krista. Tonight.

Michael looks up at him, now out of fear. His wife is putting away her wallet and is about to walk out.

MICHAEL: Done.

ELLIOT: You're also gonna tell her the truth. That you're married, cheat on your wife, you hire hookers. That you never had any intention of being serious with her.

MICHAEL: Why? That would destroy her. She thinks that...we're in love.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Exactly. Krista needs to avoid dickheads like you in the future. Her radar needs fixing.

ELLIOT: I'll know if you skip any detail. So don't.

Michael nods quickly as his wife exits the store.

ELLIOT: And one more thing I’m gonna need something from you.

INT. ELLIOT’S LOFT - NIGHT

Elliot brings Michael’s dog, Flipper, home. He gives Flipper some dog food. The dog chows down happily.

ELLIOT: Hmm. I like you, Flipper. You're cool.

MOMENTS LATER

ELLIOT (V.O.): I never want to be right about my hacks, but people always find a way to disappoint.

Elliot is on his computer burning a CD. The folder he’s copying is called MICHAEL_HANSEN. Once the burn is complete, he pulls out a sharpie and labels it PINK FLOYD - WISH YOU WERE HERE.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Michael Hansen now gets filed away among the others. Forever buried in my digital cemetery.

He grabs a large CD Case from underneath his bed and flips it open. Several other CDs labeled everything from the BEATLES to ZEPPELIN are in there. He files the newly fake-labeled CD and sends the envelope back under his bed. He jumps back on his computer and with a single keystroke deletes the Michael Hansen folder.

INT. PSYCHOLOGIST’S OFFICE - DAY

Elliot sits in his usual chair. He looks at Krista, who looks disheveled and completely out of it.

ELLIOT (V.O.): The look of disillusionment. He told her. She cried all night. Now comes the sadness. I don't like seeing her sad.

ELLIOT: You okay?

KRISTA: Sorry. Sorry. Go on.

ELLIOT: I think Angela blames me for what happened at the Evil Corp meeting. What do I do? I need to talk to her.

KRISTA: I think you just answered your own question. Talk to her.

ELLIOT: She won't respond to any of my texts or emails.

KRISTA (pointed): Then go to her in person. Tell her you need to talk. Communication is key, Elliot. Real human interaction. That's what's important for you right now.

Elliot understands, he can’t meet her eye contact.

INT. ALLSAFE OFFICES - DAY

Elliot quickly walks into the office. Angela sees him and begins to walk away. He tries to catch up.

ELLIOT: Hey. Do you..do you think we can talk?

ANGELA: What?

ELLIOT: You won't talk to me. You haven't talked to me since the meeting.

ANGELA: I don't want to talk to you because I feel embarrassed every time I think about what happened. Okay? It's fine. I'll get over it.

ELLIOT: It’s been three weeks--

ANGELA: I have to get back to work--

ELLIOT: You're just going to ignore me?

ANGELA: You didn't have to stick up for me in there. I know that you were just trying to help, just don't do it again. Even if I'm losing. Let me lose, okay? Don't look confused. Just say it. Okay?

ELLIOT: ...Okay.

Elliot nods. She puts her head down, disappointed in herself. Though this is awkward for him, Elliot slowly hugs her.

ANGELA: Elliot.

A momentary hesitation as they eye each other. The moment quickly feels like it could be a kiss. But then Elliot and Angela realize eyes are looking at them. They slowly turn only to realize the entire office is looking at the television screens past the pair. Gideon steps in and umutes the television.

ON TV:

Terry Colby is arrested by FBI and taken into custody. A MSNBC banner reads:

BREAKING NEWS - TERRY COLBY ARRESTED - CTO of Evil Corp in custody after investigation into hacking scandal.

Elliot’s eyes go wide.

EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - DAY

Elliot walks down the street, no longer in a zombified, shiftless state-- but with life and purpose.

ELLIOT (V.O.) (incredulous): It’s happening. It’s happening. It’s happening. It’s happening.

Elliot stops in Times Square and looks at the TV’s around him announcing news of the disastrous Evil Corp scandal. Pure amazement and joy begin to fill his face as he takes in the sight.

ELLIOT (V.O.) (incredulous): It’s happening. It’s happening. It’s happening. It’s happening.

He stretches his arms out like he’s just won the gold--

A MAN IN BLACK walks up to him. Elliot’s smiles is long gone.

MAN IN BLACK: Sir, step inside the car.

Other MEN IN BLACK stand behind Elliot. Sweating immediately, Elliot even notices POLICE looking the other way.

MAN IN BLACK: Sir. Get inside the vehicle. Now.

Helpless, Elliot slowly climbs in. Their car, a black Escalade, peels out.

EXT. NYC STREETS - DAY

The first MAN IN BLACK opens the door for Elliot to exit the car. They close him on all sides as they march towards a gargantuan skyscraper.

INT. SKY RISE - ELEVATOR (MOVING) - DAY

A nervous wreck, Elliot stands in the high speed elevator as it quickly climbs several stories into the air.

The elevator DINGS when it reaches the top floor. The doors open and Elliot looks out into the hall, pale as if he’s facing the gallows.

MAN IN BLACK: Go ahead.

Nervously, Elliot stares back at the MAN IN BLACK.

MAN IN BLACK: Sir, go on in.

Elliot looks down the hall again, it assumes a dizzingly blurry form as we see silhouettes dance in the room at it’s edge.

MAN IN BLACK: Sir, go on in.

INT. TOP FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

Elliot enters alone. He sees a number of MEN circle around a grand conference table. We only see their silhouettes, as they bicker and argue with one another.

Elliot’s silhouette now joins them, dead center in the mess of black outlines.

Realizing that Elliot has shown up, their loud arguing hushes into an abrupt silence. The dark shadows now face Elliot, who remains catatonic.

What follows is the longest silence of Elliot’s life as he and the dark faces exchange long, tense stares. No one speaks.

One blurred face leans forward, Tyrell Wellick. He’s wearing a thin smile.

TYRELL: Bonsoir, Elliot.

ELLIOT (V.O.): Please tell me you’re seeing this too...

Shake it up

I never loved nobody fully
Always one foot on the ground
And by protecting my heart truly
I got lost in the sounds

All of these words

All this music
And it breaks my heart

Suppose I never ever met you
Suppose we never fell in love
Suppose I never ever let you
Kiss me so sweet and so soft
Suppose I never ever saw you
Suppose you never ever called
Suppose I kept on singing love songs
Just to break my own fall

Just to break my fall
Just to break my fall

97,One Wing In The Fire,"[Verse 1]
Daddy's been a back-row Baptist
With his share of front-row sin
His Saturday night still on his breath
Every Sunday when he'd walk in
He's never led the Benediction
He's never sang in the choir
But he's an angel with no halo
And one wing in the fire

[Verse 2]
Mama lives by the Bible
The Bible lives by the bed
And she's lied alone so many nights
With scriptures in her head
Praying Good Lord, just be with him
I know his faith is tired
But he's an angel with no halo
And one wing in the fire

[Chorus]
And I know he lives a little left of living right
And he's come close to going way too far a few times
But I'd trade a thousand prayers
If just one prayer would come true
Lord, please believe in him like I believe in you

[Verse 2]
Daddy's always been there for me
From T-Ball to touchdowns
Fixed my car an' fixed my heart
When they've been broken down
I know he calls for more forgiveness
Than most folks do require
But he's an angel with no halo
An' one wing in the fire

[Chorus]
And I know he lives a little left of living right
And he's come close to going way too far a few times
But I'd trade a thousand prayers
If just one prayer would come true
Lord, please believe in him like I believe in you

[Outro]
Well, I just can't imagine
What Heaven might be like
If me and Mama make it
Without Daddy by our side
Lord, could you please remember
When it's time to call us higher
That he's an angel with no halo
And one wing in the fire",Trent Tomlinson,Trent Tomlinson,2006,"[99, 96]",2

Then I had to take him to the right
He was out of breath
But he kept on dancin' all night

[Verse 3: Chamillionaire]
It's the kid that stay ridin' big
The one police tried to catch ridin' dirty
In the club before eleven o'clock
Like I'm tryna catch a dime kinda early
Lookin' thick, her hair brown and curly
She love the way my ride shinin' pearly
City boys say she fine and pretty
And the country boys say she fine and purty (Yeah)
My pockets thick, it's green, it's curvy
And the ladies know soon as they see my jewelry
If bein' fresh to death is a crime
I think it's time for me to see the jury
You know Chamillionaire stay on the grind
A hustler like me is hard to find
I ain't really impressed, yes
Unless it's about some dollar signs
Ain't really no need to call you fine

Watchin' you do your step, do your step

This snowman is shaping up to be an 8
But not out of 10
The robots awake to find that they've been taped down
Wondering when they'll break through these chains
But little boys have action toys for brains
I'm living proof it can last a long time
Now the girls off the street are innocent and sweet
When they're all in bed
They got their make-up and dreams of wonderland
Sprinkled inside their heads
And soon they will change
But tonight Hollywood has never seemed so strange
Now mother's pray it'll last a long time

[Chorus]
I want to roll around like a kid in the snow
I want to re-learn what I already know
Just let me take flight
Dressed in red, through the night
On a great big sled

I want to wish you merry Christmas

Now they boys are all grown up
And their working their fingers to the bone
They go around chasing them girls on the weekend
You know they still can't be alone
I've been racking my brain
With thoughts of peace and love
How on earth did we get so mixed up?
I pray to god it don't last a long time

I want to roll around like a kid in the snow
I want to re-learn what I already know

That I like that, I like that

And I could tell she was leaving
And I thought, aw, she'll be back
Till she turned around and pointed at the wall and said

[Verse 2]
That picture from our honeymoon
That night in Frisco Bay
Just give it away
She said, give it away
And that big four-poster king-size bed
Where so much love was made
Just give it away
She said, just give it away

[Chorus]
Just give it away
There ain't nothing in this house worth fighting over
Oh, and we're both tired of fighting anyway
Just give it away

[Bridge]
So I tried to move on
But I found that each woman I held
Just reminded me of that day
Hmm

[Verse 3]
When that front door swung wide open
She flung her diamond ring
Said, give it away
Just give it away
And I said, now, honey, don't you even want
Your half of everything
She said, give it away
Just give it away

Just give it away
There ain't nothing in this house worth fighting over
Oh, and we're both tired of fighting anyway

So I'm still right here where she left me
Along with all the other things
She don't care about anymore

And that big four-poster king-size bed
Where all our love was made
She said, give it away

Flash the wrist, got the Johnny Dane watch froze
Five karat with the yellow stone in my earlobe
I'm squashin chatter when the light hit the pinky ring
Starched and clean, white cup full of lean
See me in that new Benz cause I'm also ballin
Or a old school slab with the fifth wheels fallin'

Just speculatin' with they gossip

[Verso 1: Anahí]
Ser o parecer quien te imaginas
No me puede hacer la dueña de tu vida
Si no me miras, baby

[Verso 2: Dulce María]
Mucho yo intenté por levantar la voz
Por despertar el interés vacío
Que te haga mío, baby

[Pre-coro: Anahí]
Y sé que tal vez ese día
Nunca me suceda

[Coro: RBD]
Pero tú en mis sueños siempre has de estar
Como una luz que me ilumina
Y al despertar quiero volverlo a intentar
Yo, sé que el corazón late más fuerte, más que un motor
Y aunque no sabes nada de mí
Un día te habré de alcanzar, amor

[Verso 3: Maite]
Cuando lo logré y me acerqué a ti
Me congelé, los nervios me mataban
No dije nada, baby

[Verso 4: Anahí y Dulce María, Anahí]
Otro día que me convencí de hablar
Te vi pasar con otra muy contento
No era el momento, baby

[Pre-coro: Dulce María]
Cómo sucedió que estoy loca
Tan enamorada

[Coro: RBD]
Pero tú en mis sueños siempre has de estar
Como una luz que me ilumina
Y al despertar quiero volverlo a intentar
Yo, sé que el corazón late más fuerte, más que un motor
Y aunque no sabes nada de mí
Un día te habré de alcanzar, amor

[Puente: Anahí, Dulce]
Verte pasar sin hablar es un cruel sufrimiento
Que desaparece de pronto cuando te pienso
Volando a mi lado, colgados de un sentimiento
No importan los días que pase o muera en el intento
Volverlo a Intentar

[Coro: RBD]
Pero tú en mis sueños siempre has de estar
Como una luz que me ilumina
Y al despertar quiero volverlo a intentar
Yo, sé que el corazón late más fuerte, más que un motor
Y aunque no sabes nada de mí
Un día te habré de alcanzar, amor

Workers were barely paid, no water, we barely bathe
There better be better days on the way that's on my daddy grave

I know you see me in that Phantom whiter than veneers

Odds are, you won't like what it is
When the storm arrives, would you be seen with me?
By the merciless eyes I've deceived?

I've seen angels fall from blinding heights
But you yourself are nothing so divine
Just next in line

Arm yourself because no one else here will save you

When you return to the night
And if you think you've won

Than you yourself, but if you must pretend
You may meet your end

118,Tell Me Baby,"[Verse 1]
They come from every state to find
Some dreams were meant to be declined
Tell the man what did you have in mind
What have you come to do?
No turning water into wine
No learning while you're in the line
I'll take you to the broken sign
You see these lights are blue
Come and get it
Lost it at the city limit
Say goodbye, cause they
Will find a way to trip it
Everybody's looking for a silly gimmick
Got to get away
Can't take it for another minute
This town is made of many things
Just look at what the current brings
So high it's almost promising
This place was made on you

[Chorus]
Tell me baby
What's your story?
Where you come from
And where you want to go this time, oh
Tell me lover
Are you lonely?
The thing we need is never all that hard to find, oh
Tell me baby
What's your story
Where you come from
And where you want to go this time, oh
You're so lovely
Are you lonely?
Giving up on the innocence you left behind

[Verse 2]
Some claim to have the fortitude
Too shrewd to blow the interlude
Sustaining pain to set the mood
Step out to be renewed
I'll move you like a baritone
Jungle brother's on the microphone
Getting over with the undertone
It's time to turn to stone
Chitty chitty baby
When your nose is in the nitty gritty
Life can be a little sweet
But life can be a little shitty
What a pity
Boston and a Kansas City
Looking for a hundred
But you only ever found a fifty
Three fingers in the honeycomb
You ring just like a xylophone
Devoted to the chromosome
The day that you left home

[Chorus]
Tell me baby
What's your story?
Where you come from
And where you want to go this time, oh
Tell me lover
Are you lonely?
The thing we need is never all that hard to find, oh

What's your story
Where you come from
And where you want to go this time, oh
You're so lovely

119,Over My Head (Cable Car),"[Verse 1]
I never knew
I never knew that everything was falling through
That everyone I knew was waiting on a queue
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth
But that's how it's gotta be
It's coming down to nothing more than apathy
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
The smoke and who's still standing when it clears

[Chorus]
And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind

[Verse 2]
Let's rearrange
I wish you were a stranger I could disengage
Just say that we agree and then never change
Soften a bit until we all just get along
But that's disregard
You find another friend and you discard
As you lose the argument in a cable car
Hanging above as the canyon comes between

[Chorus]
And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind

Everyone knows I'm in

And suddenly, I've become a part of your past
I'm becoming the part that don't last
I'm losing you and it's effortless
Without a sound, we lose sight of the ground
In the throw around
Never thought that you wanted to bring it down
I won't let it go down 'til we torch it ourselves

Takes me back to the fire in your eyes

I'm the Doctor's Advocate, nigga, Dre shot ya
Brought me back from the dead
That's why they call him the doctor
The 'Math gon' drop him
And 50 ain't rocking with him no more
It's okay! I get it popping
Whole club rocking, like a six-four Impala
Drink Cris', throw it up, call the shit hydraulics
Then piss in the cup, call the shit Hpnotiq (Brrrrat!)
I bleed Compton, spit crack and shit chronic
And you new niggas ain't shit but new niggas
Bathing Ape-shoe niggas, I'm talking to you, niggas
Bouncing in the '64, throwing up West side, man
Sell another 5 million albums? Yes, I am
Fresh like ""Damn, this nigga did it again
A hundred thousand on his neck, L.A. above the brim""
Inside the Lambo, the shotgun with Snoop
What would the muthafuckin' West Coast be
Without one crip and...?

Where niggas say ""Where you from?""
We don't never say ""Harlem""
Bandanna on the right side, gun on the left side
Niggas in New York know how to throw up the Westside
Word to Eazy, I'm so ill, believe me
I made room for Jeezy
But the rest of you niggas better be glad you breathing
All I need is one reason
I'm the king, and Dre said it: the West Coast need me
I don't know why you niggas keep trying me
Everybody know that I'm the heir to the Aftermath dynasty
And I ain't gotta make shit for the club
What DJ gon' turn down the thirty-eight snub?
You thirty-eight and you still rapping? Ughhh
I'm 26, nigga, so is the dubs
On the '07 Hummer, hop out, no bodyguards
When the chronic smoke clear all you gon' see is...

I ain't got beef with 50, no beef with Jay
What's beef when you getting head in the six-trey?
And the double Game chain, I keep 'em on display
Black T-shirt, so all you see is the A
Turn on the TV, and all you see is the A
You niggas better make up a dance and try to get radio play
Keep on snapping your fingers, I ain't going away
I don't regret what I spit, 'cause I know what I say
And niggas talking about me, they don't know when to stop
I got the Louis Vuitton belt buckle holding the Glock
No beam, no silencer; I know when to pop

I don't know what life will be in H.I.P. H.O.P

When kingdom come, you ready?
When kingdom come, I'm ready
When kingdom come I'm ready

[Verse 1]
Now everywhere I go they like HOV you back
Up out the corner office out the cul-de-sac
Where's Iceberg Slim he was the coldest cat
Get your swag back daddy where your focus at
Got to admit a little bit I was sick of rap
But despite that the boy is back
And I'm so evolved I'm so involved
I'm showing growth, I'm so in charge
I'm CEO and yeah glory to God
I'm so indebted, I should have been deaded
Selling blow in the park, this I know in my heart
Now I'm so enlightened I might glow in the dark
I been up in the office you might know him as Clark
But, just when you thought the whole world fell apart
I - take off the blazer loosen up the tie
Step inside the booth Superman is alive

I hear ""hurry up Hov'"" when I'm out in the public
'Cause niggas like: ""but you love it; you be it, you're of it
You breathe it, we need it; bring it back to the hustlas""
Had to dust off the Hammer dance, can't touch this
C'mon playboys, bring the cars back out
'Cause ya boy Hov is back, you know them broads coming out
Got 'em dancing on the banquette, like they from Bankhead
Fuck Cristal, so they ask me what we drinking
I thought dudes remark was rude okay
So I moved on to Dom, Krug Rosé
And it's much bigger issues in the world, I know
But I first had to take care of the world I know
I'm from the bottom, so I still feel 'em from the bottom
Underdog before my cape, still couldn't stop him
Flash Gordon when recording, spark the light in the dark
Peter Park', Spider-Man, all I do is climb the charts

Just when they thought it was all over
I put the whole world on my back and broad shoulders
The War-Hova, but who you know took over tracks like that
Guess what New York, New York - we back
And I ain't never been afraid of a drought
Since I was six, seventeen been getting money down South
Bout it, bout it, Master P
Ask the nigga Pimp C, ask my homie Bun B
I run the streets the streets don't run we
Y'all run, we chill still waters run deep
I repeat, sing a long with me
I run the streets, the streets don't run we

I remember when
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place

But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much

Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?

You really think you're in control?

Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me

My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on the limb

Ever since I was little, it looked like fun

It picked her up and she'll never get let down

All you people at the top don't know nothing about it
We don't give a fuck what the price is
So just leave us to our own devices and we'll leave you alone

In the dark when there's no one listening
In the times when we both get carried away
When we both get carried away

She says it all and she's pressed up against me
A little something just to take off the edge
A little more and I'll fall of the planet entirely

I'll be there when your last breath's taken away

Hey!
Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh
Hey!
Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh
Hey!

[Verse 1]
Four years, you think, for sure
That’s all you’ve got to endure
All the total dicks
All the stuck-up chicks
So superficial, so immature
Then when, you graduate
Ya take a look around and you say “Hey, wait!
This is the same as where I just came from
I thought it was over! Aw, that’s just great""

[Chorus 1]
The whole damned world is just as obsessed
With who‘s the best dressed and who’s having sex
Who‘s got the money, who gets the honeys
Who‘s kinda cute and who‘s just a mess
And you still don’t have the right look
And you don’t have the right friends
Nothing changes but the faces, the names and the trends
High school never ends
Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh
Hey!
Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh
Hey!

[Verse 2]
Check out the popular kids
You’ll never guess what Jessica did!
And how did Mary Kate lose all that weight?
And Katie had a baby so I guess Tom’s straight!
And the only thing that matters
Is climbing up that social ladder
Still care about your hair and the car you drive
Doesn’t matter if you’re 16 or 35
Reese Witherspoon, she’s the prom queen
Bill Gates, captain of the chess team
Jack Black, the clown, Brad Pitt, the quarterback
Seen it all before
I want my money back!

[Chorus 2]
The whole damned world is just as obsessed
With who’s the best dressed and who’s having sex
Who’s in the club and who’s on the drugs
Who’s throwing up before they digest
And you still don’t have the right look
And you don’t have the right friends
And you still listen to the same shit you did back then
High school never ends
Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh
(High school never ends)

[Chorus 1]
The whole damned world is just as obsessed
With who‘s the best dressed and who‘s having sex
Who‘s got the money, who gets the honeys
Who‘s kinda cute and who‘s just a mess
And I still don’t have the right look
And I still have the same three friends
And I’m pretty much the same as I was back then

139,A La Primera Persona,"[Chorus]
A la primera persona que me ayude a comprender
Pienso entregarle mi tiempo, pienso entregarle mi fe
Yo no pido que las cosas me salgan siempre bien
Pero es que ya estoy harto de perderte sin querer

[Chorus]
A la primera persona que me ayude a salir
De este infierno en el que yo mismo decidí vivir
Le regalo cualquier tarde pa' los dos
Lo que digo es que ahora mismo ya no tengo ni siquiera dónde estar

[Verse 1]
El oro pa' quien lo quiera pero si hablamos de ayer
Es tanto lo que he bebido y sigo teniendo sed
Al menos tú lo sabías, al menos no te decía
Que las cosas no eran como parecían
Pero es que

[Chorus]
A la primera persona que me ayude a sentir otra vez
Pienso entregarle mi vida, pienso entregarle mi fe
Aunque si no eres la persona que soñaba para mí
¿Qué voy a hacer? Nada
¿Qué voy a hacer de los sueños?
¿Qué voy a hacer con aquellos besos?
¿Qué puedo hacer con todo aquello
Que soñamos, dime dónde lo metemos?

[Verse 2]
¿Dónde guardo la mirada que me diste alguna vez?
¿Dónde guardo las promesas, dónde guardo el ayer?
¿Dónde guardo niña tu manera de tocarme?
¿Dónde guardo mi fe?
Aunque lo diga la gente yo no lo quiero escuchar
No hay más miedo que el que se siente cuando ya no sientes na
Niña tú lo ves tan facil, ay amor
Pero es que cuanto más sencillo tú lo ves
Más dificil se me hace

[Chorus]
A la primera persona que me ayude a caminar
Pienso entregarle mi tiempo, pienso entregarle hasta el mar
Yo no digo que sea fácil pero niña
Ahora mismo ya no tengo ni siquiera dónde estar

[Chorus]
A la primera persona que no me quiera juzgar
Pienso entregarle caricias que yo tenia guarda's
Yo no pido que las cosas me salgan siempre bien
Pero es que ya estoy harto de perderte
Y a la primera persona que me lleve a la verdad
Pienso entregarle mi tiempo, no quiero esperar más
Yo no te entiendo cuando me hablas, qué mala suerte
Y tú dices que la vida tiene cosas así de fuertes

[Verse 3]
Yo te puedo contar cómo es una llama por dentro
Yo puedo decirte cuánto es que pesa su fuego
Y es que amar en soledad es como un pozo sin fondo
Donde ni existe ni dios, donde no existen verdades
Es todo tan relativo como que estamos aquí
No sabemos pero, amor, dame sangre para vivir
Al menos tú lo sabías, al menos no te decía
Que las cosas no eran como parecían y es que

[Chorus]
A la primera persona que no me quiera juzgar
Pienso entregarle caricias que yo tenia guarda's
Niña tú lo ves tan facil, ay amor
Pero es que cuanto más sencillo tú lo ves
Más dificil se me hace
A la primera persona que no me quiera juzgar
Pienso entregarle caricias que yo tenia guarda's
Yo no digo que sea fácil pero niña

Is your game MVP like Steve Nash?

By day, I play the part in every way
Of simple, sweet, calm and collected
Pretend to my friends I'm a chameleon
Can make a girl feel disconnected
Feel like a star, a superhero
Sometimes it's hard to separate
Got too much on my plate

[Chorus]
If you could see the other side of me
I'm just like anybody else, can't you tell?
I hold the key to both realities
The girl that I want you to know
If only I could show, the other side, the other side
I want you to see, oh, the other side, the other side
The other side of me

[Verse 2]
Inside, I try to make the pieces fit right
A jigsaw puzzle everywhere
'Cause I flip the script so many times I forget
Who's on stage, who's in the mirror
Back in the spotlight, the crowd is calling
The paparazzi and the fame
It can drive a girl insane

[Chorus]
If you could see the other side of me
I'm just like anybody else, can't you tell?

152,Our Country,"Well I can stand beside
Ideals I think are right
And I can stand beside
The idea to stand and fight
I do believe
There's a dream for everyone
This is our country

There's room enough here
For science to live
And there's room enough here
For religion to forgive
And try to understand
All the people of this land
This is our country

From the east coast
To the west coast
Down the Dixie Highway
Back home
This is our country

That poverty could be
Just another ugly thing
And bigotry would be
Seen only as obscene
And the ones that run this land
Help the poor and common man
This is our country

From the east coast
To the west coast
Down the Dixie Highway
Back home
This is our country

The dream is still alive
Some day it will come true
And this country it belongs
To folks like me and you
So let the voice of freedom
Sing out through this land

To the west coast
Down the Dixie Highway

I love it when she calls me butter cup
Laughs and says I left the toilet seat up
She pops and tosses me a cold beer
And says my buddies always welcome here
When I get hungry, she takes me out
I ride the shotgun like a Shih Tzu hound
My tails a waggin', my tounge's hangin' out
It makes me wanna shout...

(”Hi Justin, this is your mother, and it's 2:33 on Monday afternoon
I was just calling to see how you were doing
You sounded really uptight last night
It made me a little nervous, and a l... and... well... it made me nervous, it sounded like you were nervous, too
I just wanted to make sure you were really okay
And wanted to see if you were checking in on your medication
You know I love you, and...
Take care, honey
I know you're under a lot of pressure
See ya. Bye bye”)

[Verse 1]
I have to block out thoughts of you so I don’t lose my head
They crawl in like a cockroach, leaving babies in my bed
Dropping little reels of tape to remind me that I’m alone
Playing movies in my head that make a porno feel like home
There's a burning in my pride, a nervous bleeding in my brain
An ounce of peace is all I want for you; will you never call again?
And will you never say that you loved me just to put it in my face?
And will you never try to reach me?
It is I that wanted space

[Hook]
Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what’s good for you

[Verse 2]
I’m sober now for 3 whole months
It’s one accomplishment that you helped me with
The one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing I won’t touch again
In a sick way, I want to thank you for holding my head up late at night
While I was busy waging wars on myself, you were trying to stop the fight
You never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicidal hate
You made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take
So I’ll drive so fucking far away that I never cross your mind
And do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind

And with a sad heart, I say bye to you and wave
Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I had made
And like a baby boy, I never was a man
Until I saw your blue eyes cry and I held your face in my hand
And then I fell down yelling, “Make it go away!”
Just make a smile come back and shine just like it used to be
And then she whispered “How can you do this to me?”

When The Pick of Destiny was released
It was a bomb
And all the critics said
That the D was done
The sun had set
And the chapter had closed
But one thing no one thought about
Was the D would rise again

[Hook 1]
Just like the phoenix
We'll fucking rise again
That's right, the phoenix
We'll rise again! Ya

[Verse 2]
'Cause the fiery heart of a champion
Cannot be quelched
By a failure or an embarrassment
No way, no
And the critics all agreed
It was a stinky pile of cheese
But that does not mean
That our hearts are not strong

Just like the phoenix
We'll fucking rise again, yah
That's right, the phoenix
We'll rise again!

And we ride with the pack

You ready? Let's go!
Yeah!
For those of you that wanna know what we're all about
It's like this, y'all, c'mon!

[Chorus]
This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Mike, he doesn't need his name up in lights
He just wants to be heard, whether it's the beat or the mic
He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him
But fuck 'em, he knows the code, it's not about the salary
It's all about reality and making some noise
Making a story, making sure his clique stays up
That means when he puts it down, Tak's pickin' it up, let's go

[Verse 2: Tak]
Who the hell is he, anyway? He never really talks much
Never concerned with status but still leaving 'em star-struck
Humbled through opportunities given despite the fact
That many misjudge him 'cause he makes a living from writing raps
Put it together himself, now the picture connects
Never asking for someone's help, or to get some respect
He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach
And now it all unfolds, the skill of an artist

[Verse 3: Ryu]
This is twenty percent skill, eighty percent beer
Be a hundred percent clear, 'cause Ryu is ill
Who would've thought he'd be the one to set the west in flames
And I heard him wreck it with The Crystal Method
""Name of the Game""
Came back, dropped Megadef, took 'em to church
I like ""Bleach"", man, Ryu had the stupidest verse
This dude is the truth, now, everybody givin' him guest spots
His stock's through the roof, I heard he fuckin' with S. Dot

[Chorus]
This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

[Verse 4: Ryu]
They call him Ryu the Sick, and he's spittin' fire with Mike
Got him out the dryer, he's hot, found him in Fort Minor with Tak
What a fucking nihilist, porcupine, he's a prick, he's a cock
The type women wanna be with and rappers hope he gets shot
Eight years in the making, patiently waiting to blow
Now, the record with Shinoda's taking over the globe
He's got a partner in crime, his shit is equally dope
You won't believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat

[Verse 5: Tak]
Tak, he's not your everyday on the block
He knows how to work with what he's got
Making his way to the top
He often gets a comment on his name, people keep asking him
""Was it given at birth or does it stand for an acronym?""
No, he's living proof, got him rocking the booth
He'll get you buzzing quicker than a shot of vodka with juice
Him and his crew are known around as one of the best
Dedicated to what they do, they give a hundred percent

[Verse 6: Mike Shinoda]
Forget Mike, nobody really knows how or why he works so hard
It seems like he's never got time
Because he writes every note and he writes every line
And I've seen him at work, when that light goes on in his mind
It's like a design is written in his head, every time
Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
And those motherfuckers he runs with, those kids that he signed?
Ridiculous, without even trying, how do they do it?

[Chorus]
This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill
Fifteen percent concentrated power of will
Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain
And a hundred percent reason to remember the name

Don't wanna be a Canadian idiot
Don't wanna be some beer-swillin' hockey nut

They all live on donuts and moose meat
And they leave the house without packin' heat
Never even bring their guns to the mall
And you know what else is too funny?
Their stupid Monopoly money
Can't take 'em seriously at all

Well, maple syrup and snow's what they export
They treat curling just like it's a real sport
They think their silly accent is so cute
Can't understand a thing they're talkin' aboot

[Chorus]
Sure, they've got their national healthcare
Cheaper meds, low crime rates and clean air
Then again, well, they've got Celine Dion
Eat their weight in Kraft macaroni
And dream of drivin' a Zamboni
All over Saskatchewan

[Verse 3]
Don't wanna be a Canadian idiot
Won't figure out their temperature in Celsius
See the map, they're hoverin' right over us
Tell you the truth, it makes me kinda nervous

[Chorus]
Always hear the same kind of story
Break their nose and they'll just say ""sorry""
Tell me what kind of freaks are that polite?
It's gotta mean they're all up to somethin'
So quick, before they see it comin'

Hey girl, I can see your body moving
And it's driving me crazy
And I didn't have the slightest idea

And everything so unexpected - the way you right and left it
So you can keep on shaking it (Let's go)

Refugees run the seas, 'cause we own our own boats

Whoo um, yeah
Life is like a road that you travel on
When there is one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There is a world outside every darkened door
Where blues will not haunt you anymore
Where brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today

[Chorus]
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you are going my way
I want to drive it all night long

[Verse 2]
Through all these cities and all these towns
It is in my blood and it is all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights
Knock me down get back up again
You are in my blood
I am not a lonely man
There is no load I cannot hold
Road so rough this I know
I will be there when the light comes in
Just tell them we are survivors

Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
An empty room can be so deafening
The silence makes you wanna scream
It drives you crazy
I chased away the shadows of your name
And burned the picture in a frame
But it couldn't save me

[Pre-Chorus]
And how could we quit something we never even tried?
Well, you still can't tell me why

[Chorus]
We built it up to watch it fall
Like we meant nothing at all
I gave and gave the best of me
But couldn't give you what you need
You walked away
You stole my life
Just to find what your looking for
But no matter how I try
I can't hate you anymore
I can't hate you anymore
(Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
You're not the person who you used to be
The one I want who wanted me
And that's a shame, but
There's only so many tears that you can cry
Before it drains the light right from your eyes
And I can't go on that way

[Pre-Chorus]
And so I'm letting of everything we were (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It doesn't mean it doesn't hurt

Sometimes you hold so tight, it slips right through your hands
Will I ever understand?

But couldn't give you what you need
You walked away

[Verse 1: Yung Joc]
Niggas in my face, damn near er' day
Ask a million questions like, Joc where ya' stay?
Tell 'em Collegepark, where they chop cars
Get twenty grand, spend a grand at the bar
Jest bought a zone, J's on my feet
I'm on that Patron, so get like me
'69 Cutlass with the bucket seats
Beat in my trunk, bought it just for the freaks
Catch me in the hood, posted at the store
Pistol in my lap, on the phone counting dough
If a girl choose, let her do her thing
Just like her mama, nice ass, nice brain
Er'body love me, I'm so fly
Niggas throw the deuces er'time I ride by
I know ya wonder why, I'm so cool
Don't ask me just do what you do (OK)

Cubes on my neck, pockets full of Ben Frank's
When I'm in the mall, hoes just pause
I pop a few tags, give me that on the wall
Time to flip the work, make the block bump
Boys from the hood call me black Donald Trump
Dope boy magic, seven days a week
Number one record, long as Nitti on the beat
Oh I think they like me, better yet I know
Lights camera action when I walk through the door
Niggas know my crew, we certified stars
Valet in the front 'bout thirty-five cars
Bitches in the back, black Beamer coupe's
Girls liking girls, time to recruit
If ya' got a problem, say it to my face
We can knuckle up any time any place

Time to set it off, let these nigga know
Have ya ever seen a Chevy with the butterfly doors?
I ride real slow, no need to speed
Gotta make sure ya' see the buckets on my feet
Fans on my trail, but they don't think I know
I keep my hands clean casue I never touch dope
Every time I see 'em, look 'em in they eyes
Ask me how I know, its me, surprise
Put it in the air, rep where ya' stay
Take a step back, blow the kush in they face
Stuntin' is a habit, let 'em see the karats

Te busco a solas con mi mejor vestido
Pero, ¿a dónde estás? ¿Qué es lo que ha pasado?
¿Qué es lo que queda después de tantos años?

Busco tu boca, tus manos, tus abrazos
Pero tú no sientes nada y te disfrazas de cordialidad

Ni rastro de los besos que antes me dabas

Sollozan estos ojos en los que ahora te ves

Como un juguete que choca contra un muro
Salgo a encontrarte y me pierdo en cuanto busco

Pongo mi espalda y algunos cuantos pasos
Y me apunto otra derrota mientras mi boca dice ""Nunca más""

186,Ridin',"Hi. I'm the Rap Critic. Let's talk about Chamillionaire. Now, back in the mid 2000's, there was a short time when Texas was all the rage in Hip-Hop. For a brief 2 or 3 years, you couldn't escape Houston rappers such as Mike Jones, Paul Wall, Lil Flip, and even old school cats like UGK started coming back on the scene. But among these emcees, few of them had as big a hit as Chamillionaire with Ridin', a forceful tune with a vibrating bass line, thumping drums, driving synths, and an unforgettable hook that brought him a number one hit on the billboard charts. Although, for a song that was such a club banger, it was actually an anthem against racial prejudice embedded in the American Police force, the likes of which we hadn't seen achieve such popularity since… well, N.W.A. For those who don't know, the phrase ""ridin' dirty"" refers to having something illegal in your car while driving, usually drugs. And in the context of the chorus...

They see me rollin, They hatin
Patrolling they tryin to catch me ridin dirty
Tryin to catch me ridin dirty

He's referring to racist cops who use their badge as an excuse to hassle people of color because they assume if they're rollin' in a nice ride, it MUST be because they're dealing drugs, and so these racist cops can't wait to reaffirm their biased views and pull over a black man with the intent of, ""put them in their place,"" as it were, that place being jail. And this is a very real problem. Seeing that black people are only about 13 percent of the American population, there is a disproportionate amount of Black people who are arrested for having marijuana in comparison to white people being arrested for having it, and if you've ever been to a predominantly white college, you know that that's not simply because white kids ""don't have as much""… So, in a slick way, this song is calling out that racial disparity, and by the sing-song nature of the chorus, it seems to take pleasure in subverting the cops' expectations

Grindin' to see if they can see me lean
I'm tinted so it ain't easy to be seen

Okay, so, we start off with Chamillionaire telling us of his desire to be seen, quickly followed by him telling us that because his car's tinted, you can't really see him… okay… not the strongest way to start a song like this, but whatever…

Ride with a new chick, she like hold up

AUGH!!! *calms down* Sorry, after that ""We Dem Boyz"" review, I'd just rather not hear that phrase in a rap song for a while

Next to the playstation controller
Is a full clip in my pistola, Send a jacker into a coma

Alright, here he's saying that if you try to steal his stuff, he'll… wait, wasn't this song about the police?

Send a jacker into a coma
Girl you ain't know, I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone

Wait, is he telling all of this to the girl he's in the car with? Well, I guess telling her that he can protect himself from any carjackers probably would make her feel safe, but… maybe when talking to a lady in your car, you shouldn't immediately follow up your line about owning a gun with a line about being mentally unstable…

Just tryin to bone ain't tryin to have no babies

That's… nice… so, how about those cops?

Laws on patrol and you know they hate me

Okay, so finally we get to the point: police harassing him purely based on the fact that he has a nice car

Twin steady twistin like ""hit this though""

Wait, so your friend is twisting up something that he wants you to take a hit of? Oh… oh…

Police pull up from behind and is in his throat

And when the police pulled up, he swallowed this thing that he wanted you to take a hit of?

Windows down gotta stop pollution

And then, you immediately rolled down the windows, to get rid of the smell this certain thing carried with it?

CDs change, niggas like ""who is that producing?""

Hey, don't change the subject, you are ridin' dirty! Well, I guess he never explicitly said that he WASN'T ridin' dirty, he just said they're trying to catch him ridin' dirty, but to his credit, he never said he was smoking anything while driving either: he said that his friend was about to light something up, and offered it to him, but he never took it. However, of course, if the cops smelled any weed on them at all, it'd be game over for the both of them, a fate that, statistically would be 3 times less likely to happen if they were white. Now, this is a bit of a nuanced criticism I'm going with here, because I'm not saying that if a black dude should be caught doing something illegal, he shouldn't go to jail, far from it; however, I'm saying that a young black male driving a nice car should be held under the same scrutiny by police officers as if he were, say, a late 20's, early 30's upper class white guy in a nice car. By the way, thank you, music video, for that illustration. But yeah, this guy's a young, rich rapper who got where he was by being a talented artist, and if he wants to enjoy the fruits of his success, he shouldn't be profiled because of it!

Got warrants in every city except Houston

Yeah, so what he has a warrant for his arrest in*change tone* every city in American except Houston? Jeez, man! And… what are you doing in Houston that's illegal anywhere else? Well, regardless, look, I understand about racial profiling and all that, but if you've got warrant's in almost every city in America, there's no way it's racial profiling at that point. I'm pretty sure you're just kind of a criminal. Either that, or he needs to stop letting his stoner friends ride passenger. Regardless, that was not a good way to end that verse. I mean, for the most part Cham doesn't directly come off as the stereotype that the police are making him out to be, so I tried to give the guy the benefit of a doubt, but a line like that throws all of it out the window, especially at the tail end there. I don't know, maybe a guest verse from Krayzie Bone could give us a more empathetic character, a guy who's getting hassled by cops, even though he's done nothing wrong

I been drinkin and smokin holy shit cause I really can't focus

Okay… never mind that idea…

I gotta get to home 'fore the po po's scope this

Okay, so… maybe he's drinking and smoking… at the same time… but hey, he might not be hurting anybody!

I gotta get to home 'fore the po po's scope this
Big ol Excursion swerving all up in the curb and...

Oh, on the curb? So, he's driving a Huge car down a… sidewalk…. that's… bad...

Doin a hundred while I puff on the blunt

Oh, driving at 100 miles per hour onto a sidewalk… that is… not better… Yeah, there's no justification for this! You can argue about making weed legal all day, but I think you'll have far fewer supporters for driving 100 miles per hour while drunk and high. Sorry, I'm gonna have to side with the police when it comes to actions that can directly lead to...

*plays car crash at the end of the song*

...well, that. Weird that we're supposed to be rooting for Krayzie Bone in this song as the cool badass when the tail end of the song shows you the exact reason why it's illegal to be impaired behind the wheel of a car!

DAMN! I done spilled my drink…

…precisely!

Yo I gotta hit the back streets
Wanted by the 6 pounds and
I got heat Glock Glock shots to the block we creep creep
Pop Pop hope cops don't see me

Oh, so you're committing murder now? The hell? We don't even know why he's doing it either! There's no justification for this happening, just out of nowhere, he decides, in his intoxicated stupor, that he's going to kill someone

With no regards for the law we dodge em like fuck em all

Okay, how is this song supposed to work again? Because the way the chorus and this verse is coming together, it sounds like they're saying ""Hey! Isn't it stupid how racist cops assume black people to be criminals?"" *guncock*""Let's justify these assumptions!"" Well, maybe something else is going on! Maybe, the idea is that Krayzie Bone is the one who's REALLY the criminal, but since the cops are so busy following Chamillionaire because he has a nice ride, they're letting the REAL criminal get away! Yeah, so Krayzie Bone is committing crimes, while Chamillionaire has nothing to do with--

We bust shots off in the air Krayzie Bone and Chamillionaire

Oh, so they ARE hanging out together. Well, there goes THAT theory

And they upset for sure cause they think they know
That they catchin me with plenty of the drank and dro

Well, if you're hanging out with Krayzie Bone, they will! Sorry, but Krayzie kinda ruined your vibe here. Whereas MAYBE you could excuse the last lyric in the first verse and take at face value the fact that Chamillionaire hadn't explicitly stated that he had done anything illegal, verifying the chorus as a justified chant against corruption in the American legal system, Krayzie Bone negates all of that, and makes it not about the common man mad at corruption in the police department, but about a reckless thug mad at police officers for doing their jobs, and sure, you can have a song about criminal lifestyles and all that, but the smugness and assuredness of that chorus led me to believe you guys were supposed to be the ones in the right in this scenario, being done wrong by the man, but when you're committing criminal acts, obviously out of love for being a criminal, since we have absolutely no reasonings behind your activities beyond ""wow, isn't shooting people and driving over the speed limit cool!?"" yeah, I'm sorry, but that doesn't garner as much empathy

So they get behind me tryin to check my tags, look at my rearview and they smilin
Thinkin they'll catch me on the wrong, they keep tryin
Steady denyin that it's racial profiling

You know, I'd be right there with ya on this if you hadn't mentioned the little part about having warrants in almost every city for your arrest! Call me cynical, but I highly doubt those warrants came from you running into EVERY racist cop in America. Okay, maybe I should let that line go, it was in the first verse, and from the way it was written, it might not have even been originally intended for this song. This is the third verse, and everything's completely different now… I guess…

Glove compartment gotta get my cash
Cause the crooked cops try to come up fast

You know, you could see this as a bad character move on his part, but honestly, hey, he just knows the game: in the case of crooked police, it's not about justice and equality on their end, so Cham might as well play along. And actually, when you think about stuff like parking tickets, speeding tickets, and getting out of jail on bail, the only lesson to really take away from all that is, ""give us enough money, and we'll leave you alone"". So, yeah, it's messed up, but Cham is circumventing wasting time with the system by giving the man what he wants

And been a baller that I am I talk to them, giving a damn bout not feeling my attitude
When they realize I ain't even ridin dirty bet you'll be leavin with an even madder mood

Yeah, take THAT, One time! Your racial prejudice blew up right in your face, giving me a legitimate reason to not take you seriously as an officer. You're an embarrassment to the force, acting on such bigoted, baseless principles! Just… don't look over there at Krayzie Bone, just, just look at me

Well, overall, I'd give this song a 3 out of 5. A LOT of this song is carried on a stellar hook and fun, bouncy production, and both emcees are quite lyrical with their delivery, by the end of the song encapsulating a lot of the distrust that black people in general have against the police. However, the constant deviations from the topic, most of which only serve to brag about getting chicks, being intoxicated and violent, ultimately fulfill the same role that racist cops look for when persecuting black people, and despite it still being drenched with tight wordplay, that fact alone throws out a lot of that goodwill. It's still a better than average song, and attempted to do more than typical mainstream rap song was doing at the time, but unfortunately, it didn't focus on delivering the topic strong enough to rate it higher

Reaching for that golden ring, we'd never let go
But who would ever let us put our filthy hands upon it?

The clouds are rolling in, because I'm gone again
And to him, I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside

I don't wanna be a murderer

I feel it in the air as I'm doin' my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

199,Is It Any Wonder?,"[Verse 1]
I, I always thought that I knew
I'd always have the right to
Be living in the kingdom of the good and true
And so on, but now I think I was wrong
And you were laughing along
And now I look a fool for thinking you were on my side

[Chorus 1]
Is it any wonder I'm tired?
Is it any wonder that I feel uptight?
Is it any wonder I don't know what's right?

[Verse 2]
Sometimes
It's hard to know where I stand
It's hard to know where I am
Well, maybe it's a puzzle I don't understand

But sometimes
I get the feeling that I'm
Stranded in the wrong time
Where love is just a lyric in a children's rhyme
A sound bite

[Chorus 2]
Is it any wonder I'm tired?
Is it any wonder that I feel uptight?
Is it any wonder I don't know what's right?

Oh, these days
After all the misery you made
Is it any wonder that I feel afraid?
Is it any wonder that I feel betrayed?

[Bridge]
Nothing left beside this old cathedral
Just the sad lonely spires
How do you make it right
Oh, but you try

[Chorus 3]
Is it any wonder I'm tired?
Is it any wonder that I feel uptight?
Is it any wonder I don't know what's right?

Oh, these days, after all the misery you made
Is it any wonder that I feel afraid?
Is it any wonder that I feel betrayed?",Keane,Keane,2006,"[98, 99, 97, 90, 88, 84, 81, 78, 81]",9
200,Not Ready To Make Nice,"[Produced by Rick Rubin]

[Verse 1]
Forgive, sounds good
Forget, I'm not sure I could
They say time heals everything
But I'm still waiting

[Verse 2]
I'm through with doubt
There's nothin' left for me to figure out
I've paid a price
And I'll keep payin'

[Chorus]
I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell and I don't have time
To go 'round and 'round and 'round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
'Cause I'm mad as hell, can't bring myself
To do what it is you think I should

[Verse 3]
I know you've said
Can't you just get over it?
It turned my whole world around
And I kinda like it

[Bridge]
I made my bed and I sleep like a baby
With no regrets and I don't mind sayin'
It's a sad, sad story when a mother will teach her
Daughter that she ought to hate a perfect stranger
And how in the world can the words that I said
Send somebody so over the edge
That they'd write me a letter sayin' that I better
Shut up and sing or my life will be over

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell and I don't have time
To go 'round and 'round and 'round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
'Cause I'm mad as hell, can't bring myself
To do what it is you think I should
I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell and I don't have time
To go 'round and 'round and 'round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
'Cause I'm mad as hell, can't bring myself
To do what it is you think I should
What it is you think I should

Fuel to the fire, that supplies your suspicion

210,Why You Wanna,"[Produced by Kevin ""Khao"" Cates]

[Intro]
Hey, T.I.P. pimpin'
Hey, shorty, why you gotta act like that?
I'm sayin', I'm just tryin' to be nice to you

[Chorus]
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye

[Verse 1]
Can't help but notice how you glowing, I can see in yo' face
Now, I just wonder if he know he close to being replaced
Swear I treat you like a queen you put me in his place
So you can give back his ring and the key to his place
Tell the nigga one thing, that you need your space
Selling niggas one thing, you don't need to chase
I wanna kiss you everywhere between your knees and waist
Hear the sounds that you making, get your knees to shake
Holla at me in the A, you feel you need to escape
I got a mansion and a gate, you with me and you safe
A Benz, a Phantom and a truck with 23's the case
600 G's in the safe, how much cheese it take?
This a chance you need to take, ain't no need to wait
Say the word, we can leave today, this song's special
And it feel like fate, hate to make a mistake
How the same thing making you sad making you stay?

[Chorus]
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye

[Verse 2]
Can he touch it like that, and make it feel like this?
How I left and came back and it's still like this?
Do he hit it from the back and make you feel it in your chest?
Take advantage of what you're concealing in your dress?
What, he think he too fresh to show that you the best?
Compliment you on your intellect and treat you with respect?
Give you sex 'til you sweat, tongue kissing on your neck?
It's been awhile since she got it like this, I bet
I can tell you ain't just another bitch I met
Ain't nobody got me open like this, not yet
You confused, ain't decided which way you should go yet
So how you keep saying no with your panties so wet?

[Chorus]
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye

[Interlude]
Ay, this nigga playing mind games, man
I think the time came that your mind changed, you understand?
Life is like a chess move
You need to make your next move your best move
Keep it pimpin', you understand? Hey
I mean, you know what I'm saying
I done showed you how I feel, you know what I'm saying
I put myself all the way out there, you know
The ball in your court, man
But I just got a question for you: Is you happy?

Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?

211,Ride For You,"[Verse 1 - Aundrea]
Lately, I've been tryna fight whatever's pulling us under
It's got a hold and really making me wonder
What it takes to get through
I gotta stick with you, my baby
Baby tell me:
Maybe I'm foolishly overreacting
But being without you I can't imagine
It's just to close to the heart and
And I won't stand it if were broken apart

[Chorus - Group]
Do you hear me?
Baby ya gotta believe in the things that make you & me win together
Don't you throw in the towel
I'm keeping my promise to you I got ya back now
When the chips are down
It seems like it's so hard for you to move ahead
Just know that I am by your side
There ain't no ifs, buts, or maybes
I'm gonna stay down and ride for you baby

[Verse 2 - Dawn]
We've been cutting it close with the backwards & forwards
It's rocking the boat; we gotta get control of this
Let's take it back to three years ago
When you said that we could make it through whatever, ever
And to me it sounded like you meant forever, ever
Leaving was not an option, baby, never, never
Now don't you believe in a love that's worth a fight
In you is everything that I'm missing
So give us a chance

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - D. Woods]
Don't you dare tell me we gotta let it go...
We been on top for too long just to let it go under
I don't wanna hear that
I just can't hear that
And know
Wherever you wanna take me
I'll go
I been with you for too long to start over with another
I know that you hear me
Just tell me you hear me

[Verso 1: Lil Wayne]
El joven Carter, soy mejor que los otros
No miento, me puedo tomar un verano libre
Puedo hacerselo a una mujer, puedo adelgazarla
Uno de mis coches, ahora voy sobre cosas buenas
Alinéalo, te garantizo que te voy a servir
El joven Chris dijo, ""run it"", así que corrí y se lo dije
Soy el joven Cash Money, Birdman Junior
Un presidente buscando una Monica

[Verso 2: Chris Brown]
El joven acaba de hacer 16, tengo el 64 (Chevrolet) y buenas motos
Tengo a 3 o 4 chicas, pero todo ese movimiento en ese bikini me vuelve loco
Para todo el tráfico en un ""stop"" porque hablas ese idioma que hablo
Ese tempo descarado con ese andar, quizás es la razón que todas estas no me verán

[Estribillo]
Puedes ser 3 años mayor pero estás bien, dame eso
Hablas como si te gustara lo que tengo, dame eso
Sé que te gusta como voy en mi Cadillac
Podrías estar en la parte de atrás diciendo, dame, dame, dame
Puedes ser 3 años mayor pero estás bien, dame eso
Hablas como si te gustara lo que tengo, dame eso
Sé que te gusta como voy en mi Cadillac
Podrías estar en la parte de atrás diciendo, dame, dame, dame

[Verso 3: Chris Brown]
Un descanso, dejame explicarte, que tu cuerpo me tiene preparado para hacerlo
Si tomas la oportunidad de que me ponga encima
Te puedo enseñar porqué lo hago bien, sobresalientes en la escuela
Soy un luchador, confia en mi y en mi edad, te tengo pensando de que soy demasiado joven para hacerlo
Puedo imaginarnos cambiando de carril en el Coupe, contigo en el teléfono gritando mi nombre, Chris

[Estribillo]
Puedes ser 3 años mayor pero estás bien, dame eso
Hablas como si te gustara lo que tengo, dame eso
Sé que te gusta como voy en mi Cadillac

Hablas como si te gustara lo que tengo, dame eso
Sé que te gusta como voy en mi Cadillac

Chica, en serio, te he estado mirando, esto es lo que tu cuerpo dice
Esto es lo que tu cuerpo dice

[Verso 4: Lil Wayne]
Cariño, ¿qué tal?, intento saludarte
No estoy decepcionado, pero te cegaré si te sonrío
Estás con el joven Chris y el mejor rapero
Deja tu teléfono, trae a tus amigas, deja que lo demás pase
Un poco de Patron, Hennessy, estoy bebiendo Cavalli Vodka
Llevo tejanos y calzoncillos Cavalli, mejor que un recién nacido
Puedo trabajarte como un sofá
Puedes quedarte desnuda
Me dejo las botas y mis joyas
Nunca sé lo que quieras, voy a dejarmelo puesto
Nunca sabes quién está en casa, lo aprendí de esa canción de Biggie
A una nueva, algo como una blanca
Creo que le gusto, me tiene de tono de llamada
Y le dije, ""Ten lo tuyo y no pares""
Dame ese ritmo y lo que tienes

221,Where'd You Go,"[Chorus: Skylar Grey & Jonah Matranga]
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
She said, ""Some days, I feel like shit
Some days, I wanna quit and just be normal for a bit.""
I don't understand why you have to always be gone
I get along, but the trips always feel so long
And I find myself trying to stay by the phone
'Cause your voice always helps me to not feel so alone
But I feel like an idiot, working my day around the call
But when I pick up, I don't have much to say

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here, singing “Where'd you go?""

[Chorus: Skylar Grey & Jonah Matranga]
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Come back home, you know, the place where you used to live
Used to barbeque up burgers and ribs
Used to have a little party every Halloween
With candy by the pile, but now
You only stop by every once in a while
Shit, I find myself just filling my time
With anything to keep the thought of you from my mind
I'm doing fine, and I’m planning to keep it that way
You can call me if you find that you have something to say

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
And I'll tell you, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here, singing “Where'd you go?”

[Chorus: Skylar Grey & Jonah Matranga]
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, no longer debating
Tired of sitting and hating and making these excuses
For why you're not around, and feeling so useless
It seems one thing has been true, all along
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess I've had it with you and your career
When you come back, I won't be here and you can sing it

[Chorus: Skylar Grey & Jonah Matranga]
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home

Sometimes it's just plain hard
Life can knock you down, it can break your heart

Life ain't always beautiful
You think you're on your way
And it's just a dead end road at the end of the day

But the struggle makes you stronger
And the changes make you wise
And happiness has its own way of takin' its sweet time

No, life ain't always beautiful
Tears will fall sometimes
Life ain't always beautiful, but it's a beautiful ride

Life ain't always beautiful
Some days I miss your smile
I get tired of walkin' all these lonely miles

And I wish for just one minute
I could see your pretty face
Guess I can dream, but life don't work that way

But the struggles makes me stronger
And the changes make me wise
And happiness has its own way of takin' its sweet time

223,Breathe (2 AM),"[Verse 1]
2 AM and she calls me 'cause I'm still awake
""Can you help me unravel my latest mistake?
I don't love him, winter just wasn't my season""
Yeah, we walk through the doors, so accusing their eyes
Like they have any right at all to criticize
Hypocrites, you're all here for the very same reason

[Chorus]
'Cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button, girl
So cradle your head in your hands
And breathe, just breathe
Oh, breathe, just breathe

[Verse 2]
May he turn 21 on the base at Fort Bliss
Just today he sat down to the flask in his fist
""Ain't been sober since maybe October of last year""
Here in town, you can tell he's been down for a while
But my god, it's so beautiful when the boy smiles
Wanna hold him, maybe, I'll just sing about it

[Chorus]
'Cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button, boys
So cradle your head in your hands
And breathe, just breathe
Oh, breathe, just breathe

There's a light at each end of this tunnel
You shout 'cause you're just as far in as you'll ever be out
And these mistakes you made, you'll just make them again
If you'd only try turning around

[Breakdown]
2 AM and I'm still awake, writing a song
If I get it all down on paper, it's no longer inside of me
Threatening the life it belongs to
And I feel like I'm naked in front of the crowd
'Cause these words are my diary screaming out loud
And I know that you'll use them, however you want to

[Chorus]
But you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button now
Sing it if you understand

You've got this new head filled up with smoke
And I've got my veins all tangled close
To those jukebox bars you frequent
The safest place to hide
A long night spent with your most obvious weakness, you start shaking at the thought
You are everything I want
'Cause you are everything I'm not

And we lay, we lay together
Just not too close, too close

Dancin' out on 7th street
Dancin' through the underground
Dancin' with the marionette
Are you happy now?

[Chorus]
Where do you go when you're lonely
Where do you go when you're blue
Where do you go when you're lonely
I'll follow you
When the stars go blue
Stars go blue
Stars go blue
Stars go blue

Laughin' with your pretty mouth
Laughin' with your broken eyes
Laughin' with your lover's tongue
In a lullaby

231,Every Time I Hear Your Name,"[Verse 1]
Finally got over that song of ours
Stopped chasin' little red sports cars
To check the license plates
And back wood drivin' by your place
Back makin' the rounds at our old haunts
Honky Tonks, restaurants
And seein' some of our old friends
It feels good to dance again
And I can finally smell your perfume
And not look around the room for you
And I can walk right by your picture in a frame
And not feel a thing, but when I hear your name

[Chorus]
I feel rain falling right out of the blue sky
And it's the fifth of May and I'm right there staring in your eyes
And nothing's change and we're still the same
And I get lost in the innocence of a first kiss
And I'm hanging onto every word running off of your lips
And that's all it takes and I'm in that place
Every time I hear your name

[Verse 2]
Got someone special in my life
Everyone thinks she'd make a great wife
Dad says he thinks she's the one
Reminds him of Mom when she was young
But it's way too soon to be talking 'bout rings
Don't wanna rush into anything
She's getting over someone too
Dinda like me and you
And she talks about him every once in a while
And I just nod my head an' smile
'Cause I know exactly what she's goin' through
Yeah, I've been there too
And when the conversation turns to you

[Chorus]
I get caught in a ""you were the only one for me""
Kinda thought, and your face is all that I see
I know I can't go back when I still go back
And there we are, a point down by the riverside
And I'm in your arms about to make love for the first time
And that's all it takes, and I'm in that place
Every time I hear your name

[Bridge]
So I'm thinkin' 'bout the words I left unsaid
(Every time I hear your name)
Stop tryin' to change the things I can't change
(Every time I hear your name)
In my heart, I know you're gone, but in my head

[Chorus]
I feel rain falling right out of the blue sky
And it's the fifth of May and I'm right there staring in your eyes
That's all it takes and I'm in that place
And there we are, a point down by the riverside
And I'm in your arms about to make love for the first time
And I can't explain, but I'm in that place
Every time I hear your name

Lemme show you how it’s supposed to be done, uh

[Verse 1: Jeannie Ortega]
Don't get me started, it's getting kinda crowded in here
Back up off me, I'm feeling like I'm suffocated
Now here's my problem, I'm not gonna be your chick on the side
Forget about it, you know damn well it wouldn't be right

[Pre-Hook: Jeannie Ortega]
I don’t know what you been thinking 'bout me
Did you think this was gonna be that easy?
Hell no, you must be going crazy

[Hook: Jeannie Ortega]
Why don't you get outta my life?
Get outta my sight
Get off of my back
Why don't you get back to your world?
Go back to your girl
I think you owe her
I know what's goin' on
I won't be second to none (no)
Back up, 'cause you're crowding my space
You need to get out of my face

[Verse 2: Jeannie Ortega]
Let’s be honest I’m not the type of chick you can use
And if you want it, if you want it you’ll have to choose
Oh, I’ve been through this, been cheated on, I know how it feels
How would I know that? You couldn't do the same to me

[Pre-Hook: Jeannie Ortega]
I don’t know what you been thinking 'bout me
Did you think this was gonna be that easy?
Hell no, you must be going crazy

Why don't you get outta my life?

Why don't you get back to your world?

I won't be second to none (oh no)
Back up, 'cause you're crowding my space
You need to get out of my face

[Verse 3: Papoose]
Bk, Bk Uh
They say you can't have your cake and eat it too
Tell me, what's the meaning?
What's the sense of me having cake if I can't eat it?
Cheaters never win, my friend, you're like creeping
But hate when your girl starts cheating
Imagine if you came home to your wife, opened your door and locked it
Then you found R. Kelly hiding in your closet
I knew you would start cheating before you even stopped it
I'm like when you double your money; I'm a profit
Albert Einstein was smart, but I'm some wiser
I'm a ladies man, your man is a womanizer
You gotta fight for love, can you make a fist?
Since your name is Jeannie, can I make a wish?
No minor setbacks, every move major
Grown folk behavior, just do me one favor
He put you on the side, let me be your savior

I've had a bad day
And nothing ever seems to go my way
I've got a heartache
Don't wanna think about it

And every time I try to smile
I cry
So I'll just hide my face
Get out of my way
Don't wanna talk about it

And I'll be fine
I just need some time

I'm hanging on today
And nothing's gonna stop me anyway
I'm holding on
I'm strong
I'm the only one who can make it change

I don't wanna fight
Gotta live my life
I'm gonna make it alright
I'm hanging on
And nothing's gonna stop me, anyway

[Verse 2:]
I went the wrong way
But I'm not lost
It's a good mistake
I saw the day break
I'm gonna shout about it

Oh
And every time I turn around
I find that I'm alone again
I've had a bad day
I'm gonna laugh about it

And I'll be fine
I'm gonna be alright

Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now
Never been afraid of standing out
But do I make you proud?

To question is to grow
That you still have faith
Is all I need to know
I've learned to love
Myself in spite of me
And I've learned to
Walk on the road that I believe

This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now
Never been afraid of standing out

Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now (stronger than I've ever been)
Never been afraid of standing out (never been afraid)
But do I make you proud?

242,How 'Bout You,"[Verse 1]
I know where I come from:
How 'bout you?
I don't need baggy clothes
Or rings in my nose to be cool
The scars on my knuckles
Match these scuffs on these cowboy boots
An' there's a whole lot more like me:
How 'bout you?
I punch the clock trying' to make it to the top:
How 'bout you?
I aren’t got no blue-blood trust fund
I can dip in to
Yeah, I wish Uncle Sam would give a damn
About the man who's collar's blue
But if he don't, hell, I'll make it on my own:
How 'bout you?

[Chorus]
An' how 'bout you?
Do you feel the way I do?
To tell the truth
I think we're the chosen few
But that's just me:
How 'bout you?

[Verse 2]
I still say: ""Yes, Ma'am"" to my Momma:
How 'bout you?
If I shake your hand, look you in the eye
You can bet your ass, it'll be the truth
I cover my heart with my hat
When they fly that Red, White and Blue
Just like my Daddy taught me:
How 'bout you?

[Chorus]
An' how 'bout you?
Do you feel the way I do?
To tell the truth
I think we're the chosen few
But that's just me:
How 'bout you?

[Verse 3]
I like my country rocking'
How 'bout you?
Just put me on a stage, man
Turn it up an' I'll turn it loose
Yeah, give me a crowd that's redneck an' loud
We'll raise the roof
Hell, I might just stay all night long
How 'bout you?
Do you feel the way I do?
To tell the truth
I think we're the chosen few
An' how 'bout you?
Do you feel the way I do?
Cause, man, I know where I come from:

243,Walk Away,"[Verse 1]
You've got your mother and your brother
Every other undercover telling you what to say (What to say)
You think I'm stupid, but the truth is that it's cupid, baby
Lovin' you has made me this way
So before you point your finger
Get your hands off of my trigger

And now the more you talk, the less I can take, oh

So tell me how come you never showed? (Never showed)
I gave you everything and never asked for anything

[Bridge]
I wanna love, I wanna fire
To feel the burn, my desires
I want a man by my side
Not a boy who runs and hides
Are you gonna fight for me?
Die for me?
Live and breathe for me?
Do you care for me?
'Cause if you don't, then boy, just leave

244,Somewhere Over The Rainbow,"When all the clouds darken up the skyway
There's a rainbow highway to be found
Leading from your window pain
To a place behind the sun
Just a step behind the rain

Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow
Where birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then oh why can't I

If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow
Why, oh, why can't I",Katharine McPhee,Katharine McPhee,2006,"[73, 50, 23, 12]",4

I wanna have the same last dream again
The one where I wake up and I'm alive
Just as the four walls close me within
My eyes are opened up with pure sunlight
I'm the first to know my dearest friends

Anything that's dead shall be re-grown
And your vicious pain, your warning sign
You will be fine

Hey oh, here I am
And here we go, life's waiting to begin

[Verse 2:]
Any type of love - it will be shown
Like every single tree reach for the sky
If you're gonna fall, I'll let you know
That I will pick you up, like you for I

Where everyone was working for this goal
Where all the children left without a trace
Only to come back, as pure as gold
To recite this all

Hoy he desperta'o
Acariciando la noticia de que tú no volverás, desorienta'o
Dando vueltas en mi cama, pensando si me amas
Yo que te he ama'o
Como nadie, como loco, amores como el mío pocos hay

Desorienta'o, en llanto desperté
Acariciando la noticia de no tenerla a uste'
Entiéndamen, los hombres también lloran
Y más cuando se va la persona que más adoran
Estoy en baja, down, ya no tengo ni palabras
Pensando en ti, dando vueltas en la cama
No es fácil vivir la agonía
De pensar en ti noche, mañana, y día
Estoy muriendo, sufriendo, yo te hago entender
Este amor, yo te lo juro, quise defender
Pero todo falló en todos los intentos
No aguanto la agonía y este sufrimiento

255,Settle For A Slowdown,"[Verse 1]
I must look just like a fool here
In the middle of the road
Standing there in your rear view
And getting soaked to the bone
This land is flat as it is mean
A man can see for a hundred miles
So I'm still praying I might see
The glow of a brake light

[Chorus 1]
But your wheels just turn
Down the road ahead
If it hurts at all
You ain't showed it yet
I keep a looking for
The slightest sign that you might miss
What you left behind
I know there's nothing stopping you now
But I'd settle for a slowdown

[Verse 2]
I held on longer than I should
Believing you might change your mind
And those bright lights of Hollywood
Would fade in time

[Chorus 1]

But your wheels just turn
Down the road ahead
If it hurts at all
You ain't showed it yet
You're just a tiny dot on that horizon line
Come on tap those brakes
Baby just one time
I know there's nothing stopping you now
I'm not asking you to turn back around

256,8th Of November,"He said goodbye to his momma
As he left South Dakota
To fight for the red white and blue
He was nineteen and green with a new M-16
Just doing what he had to do
He was dropped in the jungle
Where the choppers would rumble
With the smell of napalm in the air
The the Sargent said:
""Look up ahead""
Like a dark evil cloud
Twelve hundred came down
On him and twenty nine more
They fought for their lives
But most of them died
In the 173rd airborne

[Chorus]
On the eighth of November
The angels were crying
As they carried his brothers away
With the fire raining down
And the hell all around
There were few men left standing that day
Saw the eagle fly through a clear blue sky
1965, the eighth of November
Now he's fifty eight and his ponytail's gray
But the battle still plays in his head
He limps when he walks
But he's strong when he talks
About the shrapnel
They left in his leg
He puts on a grey suit
Over his airborne tattoo
And he ties it on one time a year
And remembers the fallen
As he orders a tall-one
And swallows it down with his tears

[Chorus]
Saw the eagle fly through a clear blue sky
1965
On the eighth of November
The angels were crying
As they carried his brothers away
With the fire raining down

That a love like ours won't last?

I spent 20 years trying to get out of this place
I was looking for something I couldn't replace
I was running away from the only thing I've ever known
Like a blind dog without a bone
I was a gypsy lost in the twilight zone
I hijacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold

Saving dimes, spending too much time on the telephone
Who says you can't go home

[Chorus]
Who says you can't go home
There's only one place they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy, born a rolling stone, who says you can't go home
Who says you can't go back, been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I want to go, who says you can't go home
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, its alright

[Verse 2]
I went as far as I could, I tried to find a new face
There isn't one of these lines that I would erase
I lived a million miles of memories on that road
With every step I take I know that I'm not alone
You take the home from the boy, but not the boy from his home
These are my streets, the only life I've ever known
Who says you can't go home

Who says you can't go home
There's only one place they call me one of their own

And it's hard to say
Who you are these days
But you run on anyway
Don't you, baby?
You keep running for another place
To find that saving grace
Don't you, baby? (Oh)

[Verse 3]
You're rolling up the carpet
Of your father's two-room mansion
No headroom for expansion no more
And there's a corner of the floor
They're telling you it's your's
You're confident but not really sure

[Chorus]
And it's hard to say
Who you are these days
But you run on anyway
Don't you, baby?
You keep running for another place

266,Everytime We Touch,"I still hear your voice when you sleep next to me
I still feel your touch in my dreams
Forgive me my weakness but I don’t know why
Without you it’s hard to survive

[Chorus]
Cause every time we touch
I get this feeling
And every time we kiss I swear I could fly
Can’t you feel my heart beat fast
I want this to last
I need you by my side
‘Cause every time we touch I feel estatic
And every time we kiss I reach for the sky
Can’t you hear my heart beat slow I can't let you go
I want u in my life
Your arms are my castle
Your heart is my sky
They wipe away tears that I cry(i cry.)
The good and the bad times
We’ve been through them all
You make me rise when I fall

[Chorus]
Cause every time we touch
I get this feeling
And every time we kiss I swear I could fly
Can’t u feel my heart beat fast
I want this to last
I need u by my side

What up, y'all? Yeah
(Soundtrakk, what's poppin', baby?)
Woo! (Ugh)
If y'all ain't know
I go by the name of Lupe Fiasco
(Kick, push, coast)
Representing that First and Fifteenth, yeah, uh
And this one right here
I dedicate this one right here (Uproxx...)
To all my homies out there grinding
You know what I'm saying? Legally and illegally, haha
You know what I'm talking about? (Woo!)
So, check it out, uh

[Verse 1]
First got it when he was six, didn't know any tricks
Matter of fact, first time he got on it, he slipped
Landed on his hip and busted his lip
For a week he had to talk with a lisp, like thisss... (Ugh)
Now we can end the story right here
But shorty didn't quit, it was something in the air (Ugh)
Yeah, he said it was something so appealing
He couldn't fight the feeling, something about it
He knew he couldn't doubt it, couldn't understand it
Branded, since the first kickflip he landed, ugh (Woo)
Labeled a misfit, a bandit
Ka-kunk, ka-kunk, ka-kunk; his neighbors couldn't stand it
So, he was banished to the park
Started in the morning, wouldn't stop 'til after dark, yeah
When they said ""It's getting late in here
So I'm sorry, young man, there's no skating here""

[Hook]
And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be

[Bridge]
So let's kick... (Ugh)
And push (Y-yeah, y-yeah-yeah)
And coast
Uh, uh, uh (Y-yeah, y-yeah-yeah)

[Verse 2]
My man got a little older, became a better roller
Yeah, no helmet, hell bent on killing himself
Is what his mama said, but he was feeling himself
Got a little more swagger in his style
Met his girlfriend, she was clapping in the crowd
Love is what-what was happening to him now, ugh!
He said ""I would marry you
But I'm engaged to these aerials and varials
And I don't think this board is strong enough to carry two""
She said ""Bow!
I weigh a hundred and twenty pounds"" (Woo!)
""Now, let me make one thing clear
I don't need to ride yours, I got mine right here""
So she took him to a spot he didn't know about
Some odd-end apartment parking lot
She said ""I don't normally take dates in here""
Security came and said ""I'm sorry, there's no skating here""

[Hook]
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
And away they roll
Just lovers intertwined with no place to go
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be

[Bridge]
So let's kick (Ugh, ugh)
And push, yeah, yeah (Woo, woo)
And coast... (Yeah, ugh!)
(Haha, swanky)
Yeah, yeah!

[Verse 3]
Before he knew, he had a crew that wasn't no punk
In they Spitfire shirts and SB dunks
They would push 'til they couldn't skate no more
Office building lobbies wasn't safe no more
And it wasn't like they wasn't getting chased no more
Just the freedom was better than breathing, they said (They said...)
An escape route they used to escape out
When things got crazy, they needed to break out
They'd head... to any place with stairs
Any good grinds, the world was theirs, ugh!
And their four wheels would take them there
Until the cops came and said, ""There's no skating here""

[Hook]
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
And away they rolled
Just rebels without a cause with no place to go
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
So come roll with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be

So let's kick (Ugh, ugh)

Every word I say, I mean it
Every single day, I feel it
But sometimes when you talk
It's obvious you want to show it
So don't blow it

[Chorus]
Tell me what we got, tell me it's a lot, tell me it's the real thing
Tell me not to change and always be the same, tell me that's a good thing
It's a good thing
Tell me not to lie, tell me not to wait
Tell me that you want the same things as me
Tell me that it's fate driving me insane
Tell me it's the real thing
That keeps me hanging on

I feel it inside when you come nearer

Tell me that you want the same things as me

It feels like you're taking a part of me with you

Tell me that you want the same things as me
Tell me that it's fate driving me insane

It started off, we were two peas in the pod
Motivated by love with the blessings of God
We were head over heels in this love thang
Funny ain't it thinkin back, our friends thought it was just a fling
I used to call you on the phone, late night tip
Mackin to you in your ear, conversation well equipped
I used to make you laugh, I used to make you smile
But all the while your roommates were in denial
We felt a lot of jealousy from the very start
Your so-called friends kept tryin to tear us apart
They used to tell you all kinda lies
Just like a wolf in sheep's clothing, the devil came in disguise
They transformed all your smiles into tears
To sabotage your happiness and blamed it on my busy career
I gave you e'rythang, aimin to please

But lately I've been on a mission for commission
So while you at home wishin you was with me I've been missin
But listen I'm tryin to lace you up with diamonds that glisten
I got a vision so baby you need to kill all the fiction
Don't listen to what your friends sayin, they just jealous
Cause they on the sidelines watchin while you in the game playin
I'm just sayin you should be stayin, but I ain't trippin
I'm in love with my money baby that's how I'm livin
You know I got you on my mind like an edge-up
And all of your naggin me and whinin it got me fed up
I'm on the grind hustlin, stackin my cash
But you just thank I'm in the streets chasin after some ass
Tryin to break that bread, I'm tryin to get that cake
But you complainin talkin 'bout you fin' to skate, baby what it do

[Paul Wall]
I'm tryin to tell you 'bout your friends hatin
While they be over there complainin I'm just on my grind paper chasin
You got them insecure thoughts in your mind
But instead of chasin hoes I be overtime on my grind
You steady listenin to the gossip in the beauty shop
But all them jealous single females want what you got
They would do anythang to take yo' place
Cause everytime I come around they be givin me that sex face
You ridin shotgun in the James Bond Benz
With the frog-eyed lens on them 20 inch do rims
So why you worried about your jealous so-called friends
I'm just on my grind tryin to stack me up some ends baby

Had to bang on homey, ear blocks, out in spots
Throwing them shots, like 'nigga, you know me'

That's why I put your ass under my arm
Fuckin' with him can bring bodily harm
And where you gonna hide in the streets when the body is gone
If it's one thing I learned that, never trust a female
On no scale, you just confirmed that

But lesson learned baby
I've made the turn

Wherever you are
No matter how far
Girl I'm gonna find my way to you
Through rivers of rain
Over mountains of pain
Do whatever on earth I've gotta do
I'll follow the dream I'll follow my heart
Girl I've gotta be
Wherever you are

So many miles to where we said goodbye
To the street of shattered dreams
I'm prayin' hard you didn't start a life
With someone who's not me
And if you're just gone
Girl I'll be movin' on

(Chorus)
Let the sunrise find me searchin'
Let the west wind carry my plea
Give this changed man one more last chance
Open your arms to me

Wherever you are
Through rivers of rain
Over mountains of pain
Do whatever on earth I've gotta do
I'll follow the dream I'll follow my heart
Girl I've gotta be
Wherever you are

My boo, no se limita a la hora de romper su pum-pum
Con curvas más calientes que el sur, right through
Enséñame si tienes la actitud, mami
Dale, go! Dale, go! Dale, go! Go!
Tiempo; llego el momento, baby, de perder el control
Trabájame ese cuerpo más que un shot de Winstrol
Sube ese temperamento, dame movimiento

296,Soundtrack To Your Life,"If you can hear me
And know that I'm right here
I heard your heartbeat
It took away the fear
'Cause my life is sliding
I tried to ride the wave
It came down crashing, it's time to start again
Backwards to go forward
Left at every corner
Been there and back again
And when the music ends

Your life is a flashback
A question, a photograph
A statement, a story, a struggle
A chance to laugh
'Cause if you don't laugh you cry
A last crescendo when you die
So hit the rewind and listen
It's the playback
The soundtrack to your life

First step, your last breath
Eveythings been planned
There's questions and answers
You'll never understand
I hold on but let go
Give you room to breathe
Remember the best things
Were never mine to keep
Starting at the ending
You won't break while your bending
Been there and back again
And when the music ends

Your life is a flashback
A question, a photograph
A statement, a story, a struggle
A chance to laugh
'Cause if you don't laugh you cry
A last crescendo when you die
So hit the rewind and listen
It's the playback
The soundtrack to your life

Soundtrack to your life
That it goes by like a bullet
And my name
It may be different than yours
But we are the same
Beat up broken back for more
I'll be dragging my own ass off the floor
I've throw myself right in it
What's the point if you don't live it

If you can hear me
And know that im right here
I heard your heartbeat
It took away the fear

Your life is a flashback
A question, a photograph
A statement, a story, a struggle
A chance to laugh
'Cause if you don't laugh you cry
A last crescendo when you die
So hit the rewind and listen
It's the playback

297,Upside Down,"[Verse 1]
Who's to say what's impossible?
Well they forgot, this world keeps spinning
And with each new day
I can feel a change in everything

And as the surface breaks, reflections fade
But in some ways, they remain the same
And as my mind begins to spread its wings
There's no stopping curiosity

[Chorus]
I wanna turn the whole thing upside down
I'll find the things they say just can't be found
I'll share this love I find with everyone
We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs
I don't want this feeling to go away

[Verse 2]
Who's to say I can't do everything?
Well I can try
And as I roll along I begin to find
Things aren't always just what they seem

I wanna turn the whole thing upside down
I'll find the things they say just can't be found
I'll share this love I find with everyone
We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs

Will it all keep spinning, spinning round and round and

I ain't got none, but I'm planning on growing some
Imagine all the Hebrews going dumb
Dancing on top of chariots and turning tight ones
Ooh, tell me when to go (dumb)
Talking on my Ghettro on the way to the store
My second or third trip
Some Henny, some Swishers and some Listerine strips
Dr. Greenthumb lips, just to ease my thoughts
Not just the cops, but the homies you got to watch
The moon is full, look at the dark clouds
Sitting in my scraper, watching Oakland Gone Wild, ta-dow

From the soil where them rappers be getting their lingo from

300,The Seashores Of Old Mexico,"[Verse 1]
I left, out of Tucson, with no destination in mind
I was running from trouble and the jail-term the Judge had in mind
And the border meant freedom, a new life, romance
And that's why I thought I should go
And start my life over on the seashores of old Mexico

[Verse 2]
My first night in Juarez, lost all the money I had
One bad senorita made use of one innocent lad
But I must keep on running; it's too late to turn back
I'm wanted in Tucson, I'm told
Yeah, and things'll blow over on the seashores of old Mexico

[Verse 3]
Two Mexican farmers en route to a town I can't say
Let me ride on the back of a flatbed half-loaded with hay
Down through Durango, Colima, Almiera
Then in the Manzanillos
Where I slept on the seashores of old Mexico

[Verse 4]
After one long siesta, I came wide awake in the night
I was startled by someone who shadowed the pale moonlight
My new-found companion, one young senorita
Who offered a broken hello
To the gringo she found on the seashores of old Mexico

[Verse 5]
She spoke of Sonora and swore that she'd never return
For her Mexican husband, she really had no great concern
Cause she loved the gringo, my red hair and lingo
That's all I needed to know
Yeah, I found what I needed on the seashores of old Mexico

[Outro]
Yeah, she loved the gringo, my red hair and lingo

Konvict {*echoes*} (Dat dada dat da)
(Dat dada dat da, dat dada dat da)
(Dat dada dat da, dada ooh)
Konvict Music, uh-huh

[Verse 1: Akon]
See I can kinda recall little ways back
Small tryin' to ball; always been black
And my hair I tried it all - I even went flat
Had a gumdee curly top and all that crap, now
Tryin' to be appreciated
Nappy headed brothers never had no ladies
Then I hit by the barber shop real quick
Had em give me little twist and it drove them crazy
And then I couldn't get no job
Cause corporate wouldn't hire no dreadlocks
Then I thought about my dogs on the block
Kinda understand why they chose a steal and rob
Was it the hair that got me this far? (uh-huh)
All these girls these cribs these cars (uh-huh)
I Hate to say it but it seem so flawed
Cause success didn't come 'til I cut it all off (uh-huh)

[Verse 2: India Arie]
Little girl with the press and curl
Age eight I got a Jheri curl
Thirteen then I got a relaxer
I was a source of so much laughter
Fifteen when it all broke off
Eighteen and then I went all natural
February two thousand and two I
Went on and did what I had to do
Cause it was time to change my life
To become the women that I am inside
Ninety-seven dreadlocks all gone
Looked in the mirror for the first time and saw that
Hey...

[Chorus: India.Arie]
I am not my hair, I am not this skin
I am not your ex-pec-tations no no
I am not my hair, I am not this skin
I am the soul that lives within

[Verse 3: India Arie]
Good hair means curls and waves
Bad hair means you look like a slave
At the turn of the century
It's time for us to redefine who we be;
You can shave it off like a South African beauty
Or get in on lock Like Bob Marley;
You can rock it straight like Oprah Winfrey -
If it's not what's on your head
It's what's underneath and say
Hey....

[Chorus]
I am not my hair, I am not this skin
I am not your expectations no
I am not my hair, I am not this skin
I am a soul that lives within

[Verse 4: Akon]
Who cares if you don't like that
With nothin' to lose post it with a wave cap
And the cops tryin' to harass cause I got waves
Ain't seen nothin' like that, not in my days (noo...)
Man, you gotta change all these feeling's
Steady judging one another by their appearance
Yes, India I feel ya girl
Now go ahead talk the rest of the world

[Bridge: India Arie]
(Oh, oh, oh) Does the way I wear my hair make me a better person?
(Whoa, whoa, whoa) Does the way I wear my hair make me a better friend? (Nooo...)
(Whoa, whoa, whoa) Does the way I wear my hair determine my integrity?
(Whoa, whoa, whoa) I am expressing my creativity...

[Verse 5: India Arie]
Breast cancer and chemotherapy
Took away her crown and glory
She promised God if she was to survive
She would enjoy everyday of her life ooh...
On national television
Her diamond eyes are sparkling
Bald headed like a full moon shining
Singing out to the whole wide world like
Hey...

[Chorus]
I am not my hair, I am not this skin
I am not your expectations no
I am not my hair, I am not this skin
I am a soul that lives within

[Outro]

Yeah the big boss man, he likes to crack that whip

Puts me somewhere at the bottom of his totem pole
Hell I do not even think he knows my name

Gotta change my answering machine
Now that I'm alone

Can't come to the phone
And I know it makes no sense
'Cause you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore

Gotta fix that calendar I have
That's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you
There's no more anniversary

And your memory
And how every song reminds me
Of what used to be
That's the reason

You and me seems organic just like the stars and planets
Yeah, we are, so what you gon' do?

Now get buck wild, shh, don't make a sound
I'll take you, lay you down
Make your body go 'round and 'round

I know you like my smile
Dig my style, dig the bow wow

317,World Wide Suicide,"[Verse 1]
I felt the earth on Monday, it moved beneath my feet
In the form of a morning paper, laid out for me to see
Saw his face in a corner picture, I recognized the name
Could not stop staring at the face I'd never see again
It's a shame to awake in a world of pain
What does it mean when a war has taken over
It's the same everyday in a hell man made
What can be saved, and who will be left to hold her?

[Chorus]
The whole world
World over
It's a worldwide suicide

[Verse 2]
Medals on a wooden mantle, next to a handsome face
That the president took for granted
Writing checks that others pay
And in all the madness
Thought becomes numb and naive
So much to talk about, nothing for to say
It's the same everyday and the wave won't break
Tell you to pray, while the devils on their shoulder
Laying claim to the take that our soldiers save
Does not equate, and the truth's already out there

[Chorus]
The whole world
World over
It's a worldwide suicide

The whole world
World over
It's a worldwide suicide

[Verse 3]
Looking in the eyes of the fallen
You got to know there's another, another, another, another
Another way
It's a shame to awake in a world of pain
What does it mean when a war has taken over
It's the same everyday and the wave won't break
Tell you to pray, while the devils on their shoulder

[Chorus]
The whole world
World over
It's a worldwide suicide

Because of you

I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you, I am afraid

[Verse 2]
I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with

I never stray too far from the sidewalk

I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing

I never stray too far from the sidewalk

325,Tonight I Wanna Cry,"[Verse 1]
Alone in this house again tonight
I got the TV on, the sound turned down and a bottle of wine
There's pictures of you and I on the walls around me
The way that it was and could have been surrounds me
I'll never get over you walking away

[Chorus]
I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that being strong meant never losing your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain
To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain
From my eyes
Tonight I wanna cry

[Verse 2]
Would it help if I turned a sad song on
""All By Myself"" would sure hit me hard now that you're gone
Or maybe unfold some old yellow lost love letters
It's going to hurt bad before it gets better
But I'll never get over you by hiding this way

[Chorus]
I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that being strong meant never losing your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain

327,Believe,"[Verse 1]
Old man Wrigley lived in that white house
Down the street where I grew up
Mama used to send me over with things
We struck a friendship up
I spent a few long summers
Out on his old porch swing

[Verse 2]
Said he was in the war when in the navy
Lost his wife, lost his baby
Broke down and asked him one time
""How you keep from goin' crazy""
He said, ""I'll see my wife and son in just a little while""
I asked him what he meant, he looked at me and smiled

[Chorus]
Said, ""I raise my hands
Bow my head
I'm findin' more and more truth
In the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to life
Than just what I can see, oh, I believe""

[Verse 3]
A few years later I was off at college
Talkin' to mom on the phone one night
Gettin' all caught up on the gossip
The ins and outs of the small town life
She said, ""Oh, by the way son
Old man Wrigley has died""

[Verse 4]
Later on that night
I laid there thinkin' back
Thought about a couple long-lost summers
I didn't know whether to cry or laugh
If there was ever anybody
Deserved a ticket to the other side
It'd be that sweet old man
Who looked me in the eye

[Chorus]
Said, ""I raise my hands
Bow my head
I'm findin' more and more truth
In the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to life
Than just what I can see...""

I can't quote the book
The chapter or the verse
You can't tell me it all ends

No, this can't be all there is

You're like water for my soul when it gets thirsty
Without you there's no me
You're the air that I breathe
Sometimes the world is dark and I just can't see
With these, demons surround all around to bring me down to negativity
But I believe, yes I believe, I said I believe
I'll stand on my own two feet
Won't be brought down on one knee
Fight with all of my might and get these demons to flee

Hashem's rays fire blaze burn bright and I believe
Out of darkness comes light, twilight unto the heights

You're a slave to yourself and you don't even know
You want to live the fast life but your brain moves slow
If you're trying to stay high, bound to stay low
You want God but you can't deflate your ego
If you're already there then there's nowhere to go
If you're cup's already full then its bound to overflow
If you're drowning in the water's and you can't stay afloat
Ask Hashem for mercy, and he'll throw you a rope
You're looking for help from God you say he couldn't be found
Searching up to the sky and looking beneath the ground
Like a King without his Crown
You keep fallin' down
You really want to live but can't get rid of your frown
Tried to reach unto the heights and wound bound down on the ground
Given up your pride and the you heard a sound
Out of night comes day and out of day comes light
Nullified to the One like sunlight in a ray
Makin' room for his love and a fire gone blaze
Makin' room for his love and a fire gone blaze

337,"Jesus, Take The Wheel","[Verse 1]
She was driving last Friday on the way to Cincinnati
On a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her Mama and her Daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was running low on faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was going way too fast
Before she knew it, she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

[Chorus]
Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel

[Verse 2]
It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said, ""I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight""

[Chorus]
Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Oh, Jesus, take the wheel

'Cause she don't tell me to

She don't tell me to

Any other woman I know would have tried
To control me and it would be over

Look at this photograph
Every time I do, it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?
And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out
And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must've done it half a dozen times
I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I, I
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
(Goodbye)

[Verse 2]
Remember the old arcade?
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down
We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel
Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I, I

It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it
If I could, I'd relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it

Every memory of walking out the front door

347,Touch The Sky,"[Produced by Just Blaze]

[Hook: Kanye West]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky
Gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boy's street team: I couldn't work the locks
Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van
Any pessimists, I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment
Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance, I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance, I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line: ""Dawg, in due time!""
Now he look at me, like, ""Damn, dawg! You where I am!""
A hip-hop legend
I think I died in that accident, ‘cause this must be Heaven

[Hook: Kanye West]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky
Gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Now let's take them hi-ah-igh-igh-igh-ighhhh
(Top of the world, baby, top top of the world!)
A-la-la-la-lah-la-lahhhhh
(Top of the world, baby, on top of the world!)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
I'd do anything to say I got it
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K. West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog, I was havin' nervous breakdowns
Like ""Man, these niggas that much better than me?""
Baby, I'm goin' on an aeroplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm tryin' to right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song

[Hook 2: Kanye West]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Yes, yes, yes, guess who's on third?
Lupe steal like Lupin the 3rd
Here like ear 'til I'm beer on the curb
Peachfuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Let's slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth
But, before you say another word
I'm back on the block like I'm layin' on the street
I'm tryna stop lyin' like I'm Mumm-Ra
But I'm not lyin' when I'm layin' on the beat, en garde
Or touché, Lupe cool as the unthawed
But I still feel possessed as a gun charge
Come as correct as a porn star
In a fresh pair steps in my best foreign car
So, I represent the first
Now let me end my verse right where the horns are, like uh

[Hook 2: Kanye West]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky

Pero jamás he visto una cosa más bella que tu mirar
Y es que son tus ojos tu sonrisa y tu boca
Y t u carita de coqueta a la primero lo que me gusta a mí
Y soy yo quien se pone siempre como un loco

Ayer hacía mucho mucho pero mucho calor
Y yo sentía frío porque no tenía todo tu amor
Hoy en cambio hace frío y siento mucho calor
Porque estás tú de nuevo conmigo mi gran amor

359,Goodbye My Lover,"[Verse 1]
Did I disappoint you or let you down?
Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?
Cause I saw the end before we'd begun
Yes I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won
So I took what's mine by eternal right
Took your soul out into the night
It may be over but it won't stop there
I am here for you, if you'd only care
You touched my heart, you touched my soul
You changed my life and all my goals
And love is blind but that I knew when
My heart was blinded by yours
I've kissed your lips and held your hand
Shared your dreams and shared your bed
I know you well, I know your smell
I've been addicted to you

[Chorus]
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

[Verse 2]
I am a dreamer and when I wake
You can't break my spirit - it's my dreams you take
And as you move on, remember me
Remember us and all we used to be
I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile
I've watched you sleeping for a while
I'd be the father of your child
I'd spend a lifetime with you
I know your fears and you know mine
We've had our doubts but now we're fine
And I love you, I swear that's true
I cannot live without you

[Chorus]
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

[Bridge]
And I still hold your hand in mine
In mine when I'm asleep
And I will bare my soul in time
When I'm kneeling at your feet

[Chorus]
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

Hello you, how was the rest?
You made it through but nevertheless
I got you out on a wire
You be love and I'll be a liar
Tell it all and fill up the air
But make it loud cause nobody's there
Nobody’s there

Stop, turn, take a look around
At all the lights and sounds
Let them bring you in
Slow burn, let it all fade out
Pull the curtain down

Make it new but stay in the lines
Just let go but keep it inside
Smile big for everyone
Even when you know what they've done
They gave you the end but not where to start
Not how to build, how to tear it apart
So tell it all and fill up the air
But make it loud cause nobody's there
Nobody’s there

Stop, turn, take a look around

Let them bring you in

363,Wasteland,"[Intro]
Change my attempt, good intentions

[Verse 1]
Crouched over, you were not there, living in fear
But signs were not really that scarce, obvious tears
But I will not hide you through this, I want you to help them
Please see the bleeding heart perched on my shirt
Die, withdraw, hide in cold sweat, quivering lips
Ignore remorse, naming a kid, living wasteland
This time you've tried all that you can, turning you red

[Chorus]
Change my attempt, good intentions
Should I? Could I?
Here we are with your obsession
Should I? Could I?

[Verse 2]
Crowned, hopeless, the article read, ""living wasteland""
This time you've tried all that you can, turning you red
But I will not hide you through this, I want you to help

Change my attempt, good intentions
Should I? Could I?
Here we are with your obsession
Should I? Could I?

Heave the silver, hollow sliver
Piercing through another victim
Turn and tremble, be judgmental
Ignorant to all the symbols
Blind the face with beauty paste

Self inflicted his perdition

I’m so scared about the future and I wanna talk to you
Oh, I wanna talk to you

You can take a picture of something you see
In the future where will I be?
You can climb a ladder up to the Sun
Or write a song nobody has sung
Or do something that's never been done

[Verse 2]
Are you lost or incomplete?
Do you feel like a puzzle, you can't find your missing piece?
Tell me how do you feel
Well, I feel like they're talking in a language I don't speak
And they're talking it to me

So you take a picture of something you see
In the future where will I be?
You can climb a ladder up to the Sun

Or do something that's never been done

So you don't know where you're going and you wanna talk?
And you feel like you're going where you've been before?

I, I'm driving black on black

I got this feeling in my veins this train is coming off the track
I'll ask polite if the devil needs a ride
'Cause the angel on my right ain't hanging out with me tonight
I'm driving past your house while you were sneaking out
I got the car door opened up so you can jump in on the run
Your mom don't know that you were missing
She'd be pissed if she could see the parts of you that I've been kissing

You're beside me on the seat
Got your hand between my knees
And you control how fast we go by just how hard you wanna squeeze
It's hard to steer when you're breathing in my ear
But I got both hands on the wheel while you got both hands on my gears
By now, no doubt that we were heading south
I guess nobody ever taught her not to speak with a full mouth
'Cause this was it, like flicking on a switch
It felt so good I almost drove into the ditch

We were parked out by the tracks
We're sitting in the back and we just started getting busy
When she whispered ""What was that?""
""The wind, I think 'cause no one else knows where we are""
And that was when she started screamin'
""That's my dad outside the car!""
Oh please, the keys, they're not in the ignition
Must have wound up on the floor while we were switching our positions
I guess they knew that she was missing
As I tried to tell her dad it was her mouth that I was kissing

Don't get me wrong, you were so good and I really wish I could
Stay a little bit longer, love you a little bit stronger
And go a little deeper, baby with you
But since this thang is calling I gotta answer dry your eyes

Posted on a corner like a light pole
They used to call us track stars
Before they even stopped we ran to dem cars
And everybody on the block got the same agenda
Hustle from the beginning of January til the end of December
Wasn't smokin purple then it was more like bobby brown
On that hen dog got a nigga drinking straight brown (7/11 nigga you know)
You know 10 to 4 shake 'em up talk shit get my drink and let 'em go

Why you think they love me so much (ha ha!)

We had a lot of good times together (Come on, baby, come on darlin', darlin')
We did everything together

Yeah, we would wake up early in the morning (All I need, all I need, all I need is a chance to make it right)
And just get in the car and just ride on out (Just one chance)
Remember that? (All I need, all I need, is just one wish)
Use to watch the sunrise
(One wish, one wish)

Use to watch the sunset (All I need, all I need, all I need is a chance to make it right)
We was everything to each other, you know? (Just one chance)
(All I need, all I need, is just one wish)
Damn, I miss those days

One little, itty, bitty wish
If I could just have one wish

[Intro]
Damn baby..
Just don't understand where we went wrong
I gave you my heart
I gave you my soul
I gave you...

[Verse 1]
As a matter of fact I was the one who said I love you first
It was about eight years ago, don't act like you don't know
We were sittin' at home in your mama's livin' room
Cause, we couldn't be alone
See your mama knew I was something else, she knew how I felt
Back then we were in school and that's your favorite excuse
Growin' up I was a fool and I can't lie I'm missing you
Listen and don't trip
I think I need a bottle with a genie in it
Here's my wish list

[Hook]
First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'll make you my whole life
And you'll be my wife, make it right this time

If I had one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish

[Verse 2]
Now tell me is this the only way I can get you right back in
If so then searchin' I'll go, then I can have you for sho
Then you'll be loving me, holding me, kissing me
So girl don't tell me what I'm feeling is make believe
I swear if I lose a second chance with you
I wouldn't know what to do
I'll probably check myself into some kind of clinic
I couldn't be alone because without you I'm sick
Here's my wish list

[Hook]
First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes cause I'll be okay if I get one

I stay dressed to impress

Except how I'm gettin home tomorrow
Cease will drop you off when he see his P.O

Man she spilled a drink on my cream Wallows
Reach the gate, hungry just ate
Riffin, she got to be to work by eight
This must mean she ain't tryna wait
Conversate, sex on the first date
I state, ""You know what you do to me""
She starts off, ""But I don't usually""
Then I whipped it out, rubber no doubt
Step out, show me what you all about
Fingers in your mouth, open up your blouse
Pull your G-string down South
I threw that back out, in the parking lot

Speedin' be leanin' got 'em fiendin'

Ohh, she put her beer down
Here she comes

Hustlers shootin' eight ball
Throwin' darts at the wall
Feelin' damn near ten feet tall
Here she comes, Lord help us all

Poor ole boy, it ain't his fault
It's so hard not to stare

Now Honey, you can't blame her
For what her mama gave her

And I'm thankful for that each and every day
And if I count all my blessings, I get a smile on my face

And tell me we'll be alright
If you promise never to leave

386,When I'm Gone,"[Intro]
Yeah, it's my life
In my own words, I guess

[Verse 1]
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart and you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
""Daddy, look what I made!"" ""Dad's gotta go catch a plane""
""Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?""
""I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writin' a song, this song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself""
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

[Verse 2]
I keep havin' this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screamin' she don't want me to sing
""You're makin' Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?""
""Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more"" ""Daddy, you're lyin'!
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leavin' no more, Daddy, you're mine!""
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door, tryna block it
""Daddy, please! Daddy, don't leave! Daddy, no, stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it with ya!""
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man, I can hear 'em
They're sayin', ""You got one more chance to do right and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late!""
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and this spotlight is on and I'm singin'

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

Sixty-thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow, and thank you all for comin' out
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
""Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!""
But baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
""I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin
I get the point, fine, me and Mommy are goin'.""

Just take another pill, yeah, I bet you you will
You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real.""
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream, ""Die, Shady!"" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was
Supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles, and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

387,Who I Am Hates Who I've Been,"[Verse 1]
I watched the proverbial sunrise
Coming up over the Pacific and
You might think I'm losing my mind
But I will shy away from the specifics

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause I don't want you to know where I am
'Cause then you'll see my heart
In the saddest state it's ever been
This is no place to try and live my life

[Chorus 1]
(Stop right there) That's exactly where I lost it
(See that line?) Well, I never should have crossed it
(Stop right there) Well, I never should have said
That it's the very moment that I wish that I could take back

[Chorus 2]
I'm sorry for
The person I became
I'm sorry that
It took so long for me to change
I'm ready to
Be sure I never become that way again
'Cause who I am hates who I've been
Who I am hates who I've been

[Verse 2]
I talk to absolutely no one
Couldn't keep to myself enough
And the things bottled inside have finally begun
To create so much pressure that I'll soon blow up
And I heard the reverberating footsteps
Syncing up to the beating of my heart
And I was positive that unless
I got myself together I would watch me fall apart

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I can't let that happen again
'Cause then you'll see my heart
In the saddest state it's ever been
This is no place to try and live my life

[Chorus 1]
(Stop right there) That's exactly where I lost it
(See that line?) I never should have crossed it
(Stop right there) I never should have said
That it's the very moment that I wish that I could take back
(Stop right there) That's exactly where I lost it
(See that line?) Well, I never should have crossed it
(Stop right there) Well, I never should have said
That it's the very moment that I wish that I could take back

I'm sorry for
The person I became
I'm sorry that
It took so long for me to change

Who I am hates who I've been
And who I am will take the second chance You gave me

394,Cowboys Are Frequently Secretly (Fond Of Each Other),"Well, there's many a strange impulse out on the plains of West Texas
There's many a young boy who feels things he can't comprehend
And a small town don't like it when somebody falls between sexes
No, a small town don't like it when a cowboy has feelings for men

And I believe to my soul that inside every man there's the feminine
And inside every lady there's a deep manly voice loud and clear
Well, a cowboy may brag about things that he's done with his women
But the ones who brag loudest are the ones that are most likely queer

Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other
Say, what do you think all them saddles and boots was about?
And there's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels for his brother
And inside every cowboy there's a lady that'd love to slip out

And there's always somebody who says what the others just whisper
And mostly that someone's the first one to get shot down dead
So when you talk to a cowboy don't treat him like he was a sister
You can't fuck with a lady that's sleepin' in each cowboy's head

Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other
What did you think all them saddles and boots was about?
And there's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels for his brother
And inside every lady there's a cowboy who wants to come out
And inside every cowboy there's a lady that'd love to slip out",Willie Nelson,Willie Nelson,2006,[52],1

398,My Old Friend,"[Verse 1]
My old friend, I recall
The times we had hanging on my wall
I would not trade them for gold
Because they laugh and they cry me
Somehow sanctify me
They are woven in the stories I have told
And tell again

[Verse 2]
My old friend, I apologize
For the years that have passed
Since the last time you and I
Dusted off those memories
But the running and the races
The people and the places
There is always somewhere else I had to be
Time gets slim, my old friend

[Interlude]
Do not know why, do not know why
Do not know why, do not know why

[Verse 3]
My old friend, this song is for you
Because a few simple verses
Was the least that I could do
To tell the world that you were here
Because the love and the laughter
Will live on long after
All of the sadness and the tears
We will meet again, my old friend

They call me the Juice and you know I'ma stunt
Riding in the car with some bump in the trunk
Tone in my lap and you know it's a pump
Breaking down the good green, rolling the blunt
Ghetto pimp type, girls say I'm the man
Ice on the wrist with the ice in the chain
Riding through the hood, got me gripping the grain
And I'm sipping the same, while I'm changing the lane
Eyes real tight cause I'm choking the green
Vision messed up, 'cause I'm drinking the lean
Messing with a D-Boy, riding them big toys
Make your main gal wanna get on my team
She gotta give it up before she get in my car
I ain't Denzel, but I know I'm a star
Cause when I'm in the club, I be back in the fog
In the V.I.P. part & be buying the bar

DJ Paul is a dog, one you do not trust
You leave your green around me, nigga your green gonna get lit up
You leave your drank around me, believe your drank gonna get drunk up
You leave your girl around me, if she bad she gonna get stuck

Riding 'round what they like

But them hoes gonna come out
Just really wanna smoke my weed
Fuck these hoes and stack my g's
Stop at the light and pause on Three
Hit the mall and it be all on me, but
Gotta keep one eye up on the po-po
Close the window, when I roll the indo
Know they mad cause I'm rolling Benzo

So when I'm in Memphis, Tennekee
I just might not bring my own 'cause them niggas there let me smoke for free

Coughing and choking constantly
Taste like fruit when you hit it
Gotta have bread to get it

Roll that shit, light that shit, hit that shit, hold that shit
Blow that shit out slow, then pass it to me bro

MJ finna sprinkle in some of that
Super incredible, have a nigga running back
Where that nigga with the hood sticky number at

And it's making me lose control

The hammer may strike, be dead on the ground
A net to my hand, a cross on his crown
We're done if, who we're undone
Finished if who we are incomplete
As one we are everything
We are everything we need

We belong together
Like the open seas and shores
Wedded by the planet force

What good is a life
With no one to share
The light of the moon
The honor of a swear?
The kingdom of men
Is hollow within
Without depth
Without the care
That it takes to make a perfect love
The passion to find the other truth
To visualize the straightened from the skewed
To trade a common comfort for a view
Would you try to live the way in which you speak?
Taste the milk of your mother earth's love?
Spread the word of consciousness you seek?
We are everything we need

[Chorus]
We belong together
Like the open seas and shores
Wedded by the planet force

All this independent strength

Feel what it's like to be new

Where I send my thoughts to far off destinations
So they may have a chance of finding a place
Where they're far more suited than here

Well, I cannot guess what we'll discover
When we turn the dirt with our palms cupped like shovels
But I know our filthy hands can wash one another's
And not one speck will remain

I do believe it's true
That there are roads left in both of our shoes
But if the silence takes you, then I hope it takes me too
So, brown eyes, I'll hold you near

From the Chi, like Tim it's a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise of the minimum wage?
And I know that the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allāhu Akbar and throw in some hot cars
Things we see on the screen that's not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars - I know it

Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today (Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today)

And nothing last forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way

They say people in your life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And Gran keep praying and keep believing
In Jesus, and one day that you see him

The devil is alive I feel him breathin

And put them lottery tickets just to tease us

That it is easy for you to blame everything on me

Continue to take this from you

I might as well have threw away my love
As much as you accused me

Don't you know I wish I knew that you would treat me this way
If you don't promise me that you've changed your ways, I'm leaving today

I should have lied, I should have cheated
Maybe I should have went out to the club
Or maybe I, I should have done it
I should have given away all my love
Or maybe I, I should have played you
'Cause you don't appreciate me, no
And I tried to stay down with you
But your making it hard on me

And my friends are just as screwy as me

Preppy girls never looked at me
Why should they? I ain't nobody
Got nothing in my pocket

Look at all those movie stars

Looking for forgiveness

Where life's wooly and wild
Came an Air Force brat

And from bucking broncs
To honky tonks

Having too much fun

Well, once again he was spinning 'round
Took the whole world on
And he turned us on
To that Western Underground
And from ""Bareback Jack""
To ""This Cowboy's Hat""

He would not slow down
From town to town
Like children running through the rain

Couldn't handle forgiveness, now I'm far, beyond gone
And I can hardly remember, the look of my own eyes
How can I love this, a life so dishonest, it made me compromise

All the chicks be lovin Twista when he spittin 'em rhymes

Try and stick me, I'ma let off a full clip
It ain't my fault you done fucked up your re-up
At the dice game, who told you put a G up?
Everybody mad when they paper don't stack right
But when I come around y'all niggas better act right

Tell her, ""Meet me at the Mondrian so we can do our thang.""
She can bring the lingerie with her, I sup-pose
Then we can go from fully dressed to just havin' no clothes
Then she can run and tell her best friend 'bout my sex game
Then her best friend could potentially be next, mane
Listen mane, shit changed, I came up, I'm doin' my thang

438,Skin (Sarabeth),"Sarah Beth is scared to death
To hear what the doctor will say
She hasn't been well
Since the day that she fell
And the bruise, it just won't go away

So she sits and she waits, with her mother and dad
And flips through an old magazine
Till a nurse with a smile
Stands at the door
And says, 'Will you please come with me?'

Sarah Beth is scared to death
'Cause the doctor just told her the news
Between the red cells and white
Something's not right
But we're gonna take care of you

Six chances in ten, it won't come back again
With the therapy we're gonna try
It's just been approved
It's the strongest there is
I think we caught it in time

Sarah Beth closes her eyes
She dreams she's dancing
Around and around, without any cares
And her very first love is holding her close
And the soft wind is blowing her hair

Sarah Beth is scared to death
As she sits, holding her mom
Says it would be a mistake
For someone to take
A girl with no hair to the prom

For just this morning, right there on her pillow
Was the cruelest of any surprise
And she cried when she gathered it all in her hands
The proof that she couldn't deny

Sarah Beth closes her eyes
She dreams she's dancing
Around and around, without any cares
And her very first love is holding her close
And the soft wind is blowing her hair

It's quarter to seven, that boy is at the door
Her Daddy ushers him in
When he takes off his cap, they all start to cry
'Cause this morning where his hair had been
Softly, she touches just skin

They go dancing
Around and around, without any cares
And her very first, true love is holding her close
And for a moment, she isn't scared",Rascal Flatts,Rascal Flatts,2006,"[95, 77, 98]",3

444,Comin' To Your City,"[Chorus:]
Well we're comin to your city
Gonna play our guitars and sing you a country song
We'll all be flyin higher than a jet air liner
And if you want a little bang in your ying yang come along

Well we flew through Cincinnati
And we all got really happy
Grabbed a bowl of that Skyline Chili along the way
Then we rolled on into Canton
Scared the hell out of Marilyn Manson
And the party started happenin
Hey hey hey

Then in the middle of a Charleston night
We ran into Jesco White
And a little moonshine got us right plum smacked insane

[Chorus]

Well we broke down in Greenville
In the middle of a hayfield
But a Bud Light truck pulled up and helped us out

So we then headed up to Philly
Partied down like real hillbillies
Brought the Music Mafia
And rocked it out

And Chippewa's where we go
When we're up in Buffalo
Don't you know those yankees drink enough to DROWN

[Chorus]

Listen up
Now LA's got the freaks
At Pink's and 15 dollar drinks
And San Antonio was a wild wild rodeo

And then Phoenix, Arizona
We drank way too much Corona
And we woke up by the river
In Jeff City, MO

[Chorus]

Yeah, yeah
We're comin to your city
We're gonna play our guitars and sing you a country song
We'll all be flyin higher than a jet air liner
And if you want a little bang in your ying yang
If you wanna little zing in your zang zang
If you wanna little ting in your tang tang
Come along, come along, come along, come along

Yeah, we're comin to your city",Big and Rich,Big & Rich,2006,[89],1
445,More Than Words,"(Verse 1)
Saying I love you
Is not the words I want to hear from you
Its not that I want you not to say
But if you only knew
How easy it would be to show me how you feel

More than words
Is all you have to do to make it real
Then you wouldn't have to say
That you love me, yeah
Cause I'd already know

(Verse 2)
What would you do (what would you do)
If my heart was torn in two?
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say
If I took those words away
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying I Love You

(just saying I love you, saying I love you)
More than words
(just saying I love you, saying I love you)

(Verse 3)
Now that I've tried to (now that I've tried to)
Talk to you and make you understand
All you have to do is
Close your eyes and just reach out your hand
And touch me
Hold me close don't ever let me go

More than words
Is all you ever needed me to show
Then you wouldn't have to say
That you love me, yeah
Cause I'd already know

(just saying I love you, saying I love you)
More than words

447,Best I Ever Had,"So you sailed away into a grey sky morning
Now I'm here to stay, love can be so boring
And nothing's quite the same now
I just say your name now

But it's not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
You don't want me back
You're just the best I ever had

So you stole my world, now I'm just a phony
Remembering the girl leaves me down and loney
Well send it in a letter
Make yourself feel better

But it's not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
You dont want me back
You're just the best I ever had

And it might take some time to patch me up inside
But I can't take it so I, I run away and hide
And I might find in time that you were always right
You're always right

So you sailed away into a grey sky morning
Now, I'm here to stay, love can be so boring
Was it what you wanted?
Could it be I'm haunted?

But it's not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
You dont want me back
You're just the best I ever had

You're just the best I ever had",Gary Allan,Gary Allan,2006,[94],1
448,Stricken,"[Verse 1]
You walk on like a woman in suffering
Won't even bother now to tell me why
You come alone, letting all of us savor the moment
Leaving me broken another time
You come on like a bloodstained hurricane
Leave me alone, let me be this time
You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption
I don't want to mention, the reason I know

[Chorus]
That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss will I run

[Verse 2]
You don't know what your power has done to me
I want to know if I'll heal inside
I can't go on with a holocaust about to happen
Seeing you laughing another time
You'll never know why your face has haunted me
My very soul has to bleed this time
Another hole in the wall of my inner defenses
Leaving me breathless, the reason I know

[Chorus]
That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss will I run
Into the abyss will I run

Won't even bother now to tell me why

When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need

When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones

450,Pretty Vegas,"Falling asleep at the wheel again, baby
You're drifting over the line, line, yeah
Your hands are tight but you're losing grip quickly
Fix me, can you read the signs?

Thumbing your way to Vegas, dirty
And dreaming of the other side
Save your tears and laughter
Because it doesn't matter what you find

It ain't pretty
After the show
It ain't pretty when the pretty leaves you
With no place to go
If you think you need it
Here's the place to feed it
But it ain't pretty

When everything that you do is wrong
And you feel like you can barely survive, yeah
When those around you are crumbling downwards
Buried in the sunset alive

Thumbing your way to Vegas, dirty
And screaming like you're back from hell
Save your dreams and occupations
'Cause it doesn't matter what you sell

It ain't pretty
After the show
It ain't pretty when the pretty leaves you
With no place to go
If you think you want it
Here's the place to get it
But it ain't pretty

The party's over and the road is long
The party's over and you're moving on
The party's over and the road is long

If you think you want it
Then just come out and say it
It ain't pretty

Falling asleep at the wheel again, baby
You're drifting over the line, line, yeah
Your hands are tight but you're losing grip quickly
Fix me, can you read the signs?

Thumbing your way to Vegas, dirty
And dreamin' like you're outta control
Save your tears and laughter
Because this is the ride
And this is the show

It ain't pretty

It ain't pretty when the pretty leaves you
With no place to go
If you think you want it
Just come in and get it

Campicu, llego el frontú
No trates de apagarme porque te apagas tú
Doble U, apágale la luz
Mami, acelera duro ese cucú
Tiene veinte enemigas, dos amigas
Pantalla en la barriga, tatuaje en la vejiga
En el culipande'o ella mata la liga
Siga, si-si-si-siga

Bizcochito, dame un beso con sabor a caramelo

Cielo, a ese trago le hace falta hielo

Pues tenga lo suyo, sin orgullo
Yo tengo el agua pa' ese capullo (Sss)

Coge lo que es tuyo (Tu-tu-tu-tuyo)
