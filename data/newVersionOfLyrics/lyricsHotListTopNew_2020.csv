I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold

I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Verse 2]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you

Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

Фу, ты чудовище!

[Куплет 1: Eminem]
Я могу проглотить бутылку спиртного и буду будто Годзилла
Лучше падай на землю, будто лист осенний
Со мной весь отряд, гуляет по этой тусовке
Кроссовер зомби-апокалипсиса и большого Бобби
""The Brain"" Хинана, который возможно
Стал тоже причиной моей борьбы с манией
Шейди в этой суке, я в полном поряде
Считайте, что переходить мне дорогу - дорогого стоит
Если они проспали меня, то, сука, лучше страдать от бессонницы
СДВГ, гидроксикат
Передай мне Courvoisi' (Хэй, хэй)
В АА с АК, ближний бой, наконец устроим развлекуху
Лучше уйти, отлететь, будто в отпуск
Этот бит крэй-крэйзи, Ray J, Х-А-Х-А-Х-А
Смеясь всю дорогу до банка, я распускаю интриги
Они не могут укротить или усмирить того, кто

[Припев: Juice WRLD, Eminem]
Монстр
Если ты встанешь у меня на пути, я скормлю тебя монстру (Yeah)
Днем я нормальный, но ночью превращаюсь в монстра (Yeah)
Когда луна светит, как «Ледовый путь дальнобойщиков»
Я выгляжу как злодей из этих блокбастеров
Годзилла извергает пламя, монстр
Кровь на танцполе и на ковре Луи Ви
Пламя, Годзилла, пламя, монстр
Кровь на танцполе и на ковре Луи Ви

[Куплет 2: Eminem]
Я просто продукт Слик Рика и Onyx, сказал всем лизать мои яйца
Шокировал их кучей вещей, что их бесила
Перечислить их все не хватит силы
И посреди всего этого
Я в психбольнице с волшебным шаром
Пытаюсь разглядеть, останусь ли таким же завтра?
Рисперидон, шепот голосов
Мой кулак снова прижат к стене, обрисован карандашом
Это как раз та песня, от которой можно взбеситься
Ты только что наставил пистолет на парня с ракетной установкой
Я будто с Лох-Несса, мифический
Быстро, скажи суке исчезнуть, как и водке
Когда слышу скрип бутылки, я

Если тебе всегда было насрать, подними руку
Потому как я собрался в трип, планирую отдых
Я сфокусирован, как мой указательный, так что всё, что вы когда-либо получите, это
Мой злоебучий палец (Палец), проверку простаты (-статы)
Как я потею с кучей фанов?
Как шапка вора, я — пламя
И мне на пенсию рано
Всё ещё герой твоей драмы
Чики теряют контроль: я с годами прекрасней
От меня они текут, как вода из-под крана
Что посеешь, то и пожнешь, как в поле рожь, как в теле нож
Ведь я взял подачу своей пачки прямо с биты, бейсбол
Как Kid Ink, сука, я с такой легкостью заполучил их, что они называют меня Дидди
Ведь я создаю группы и они стреляют на раз, два
Сука, я игрок, я слишком скуп для Шер
Я даже ухом не пошевелю, даже не притворюсь, что мне не все равно
Но я говорю сучке, что женюсь на ней, если она похоронит своё
Лицо на моих гениталиях, настоящий Ричард Рамирес
Кристиан Ривера, потому что мои тексты не нравятся людям
Так что меня бы за них посадили на стул
Как паралич, и это страшно, назовем это Гарри Кэрэй
Потому что каждый Том, Дик и Гарри носят с собой и трясутся над гребаным словарем
Клянутся и божатся, что могут круто зачитывать, эта херня уморительная
Пора поместить этих сучек в колонку некрологов
Мы разошлись во взглядах, как косоглазие
Управляюсь с этим, будто руль с машиной (Mark Jack)
Любитель пострелять, ношу ствол, но сохраняю анонимность
Злая половина Bad Meets
Evil, значит, назад откинься
Иди к Fat Beats с макси-синглом
Посмотри на мои тексты: что привлекает этих людей?
Моя гангстерскость, сука, как Apache с цепляющей мелодией
Я складываю фишки, ты только пачки Читос
Наполнил ядом и уничтожил их
Другими словами, я их выжал, как сок
Я не хочу причинять им боль, но я сделал это в приступе ярости
Я снова убиваю, и никто не ускользнет от него
Я убью их и сброшу все эти чертовы тела в озеро
Уничтожая все, сжигая и предавая их
И я заставляю бояться любого, кто хочет выйти с пером
Но никто не хочет этого, но все равно получат все это
Потому что я начинаю чувствовать себя психбольным
Я Атилла, убей или будешь убит, пчела-убийца, обычная горилла
Ты вытаскиваешь убийцу изнутри меня
Ты не захочешь быть врагом демона, который вошел в меня
И быть на том конце меня, какая это была бы глупость
Каждая частичка меня - воплощение плевка
Когда я буду поблизости, ублюдок, тебе лучше пригнуться
Или ты умрешь в ту же минуту, как столкнешься со мной
Сто процентов тебя - это одна пятая процента меня
Я собираюсь прикончить тебя, сука, я бессмертен
Ты хочешь баттл, я свободен, я подрываю так, будто я сапер
Я непобедим, я неотвратим, я неотразим
Я на унитазе, есть полный денег трейлер, ведь мне платят сполна
Я не боюсь потянуть за ручку...

We took a hard left, but we're alright
Yeah, life sure can try to put love through it, but
We built this right, so nothing's ever gonna move it

When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation

Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good

You know the vibes

Trips that you plan for the next whole week
Bands too long for a nigga so cheap
And your flex OD, and your sex OD
You got it, girl, you got it (Oh)
Oh lemme tell you
You got it, girl, you got it
You should deal with a five star nigga
Know you work more than just 6 figures
I'm applying the pressure my finger on the trigger
I know you got a roster just full of hittas
But you need a first line up like Kawhi to the Clippers
Been through so much shit that you don't even know the difference
Made so many mental notes that you can't save a picture
Got so many cuts and bruises I was still invested
Still treat you like the best like KD to the Nets

You ain't even all that fine in person

Hundred thousand in my mouth like, ""What's happenin'?""
Not the big cheap teeth, that's embarrasin'
He ain't me, you can keep the comparisons
My bitch probably one of the baddest
Good girl, turned her into a savage
Dispatch, got a problem in traffic
We came through in matching G-Wagens
Low-key, I've been keeping it classy
Could be really out here doin' 'em nasty
Niggas couldn't even see me in last year
Just started and them niggas in last gear
I ain't even try to and I passed 'em

Drop a song, I be giving them captions
Stand alone, not your regular rapper

Wanna do shows and make me some songs
Make sure that other shit come in, get sold
We fuck with the strippers 'cause we play with poles
We play with our money and not with our nose
I used to go to the West to get loads
I just came back from the West with a trophy
I'm on some more shit
She said she miss it and sendin' emojis
No time to kick it, I'm always in motion
Can't say I miss you, I don't got emotions

I'm on that me-and-the-bro-kick-a-door shit

I'm at a fish I don't wanna be in
I'm not prepared and I have no clothes
I can face my back
Ask yourself if it's possible to buy a seat

Where is my hand?
I said to myself, ""Do you dance?"" (Satan)
Do you know that I love myself?
Is everything in life real?

Holiday does not match with confidence

I want you to have a child
Everything was destroyed by poverty
And that man right in front of me

We can control the lightning chain
Yes, that's my son
What is your name?

Because you're still in prison, I'm sorry
Taxis in hell cost six dollars per minute
And I'm so happy with other people

We can control the lighting chain
Yes, that's my son
What is your name?

We do not want to be dinner
Terry, I do not know
I want to read my ears
This place exists

It is the disease of tension
But what I say is done
Education? Eh, it's nice for me to think about it
Find out the good things

No human contact
Yes, everyone is right, yes
I'm very happy with the animals
And you can heal him

I do not like you, you are so beautiful

What is there to say?
There ain't a better time than today
But maybe I'll lay down for a little, yeah
Instead of always trying to figure everything out
And all I do is say sorry
Half the time I don't even know what I'm saying it about

No, they don't like it when I'm down
But when I'm flying, oh
It make 'em so uncomfortable
So different, what's the difference?

[Verse 2]
Well, it ain't that bad
It could always be worse
I'm running out of gas, hardly anything left
Hope I make it home from work
Well, so tired of being so tired
Why I gotta build something beautiful just to go set it on fire?
I'm no liar, but
Sometimes the truth don't sound like the truth
Maybe 'cause it ain't
I just love the way it sound when I say it
Yeah, it's what I do
If you know me, it ain't anything new
Wake up to the moon, haven't seen the sun in a while
But I heard that the sky's still blue, yeah
I heard they don't talk about me too much no more
And that's a problem with a closed door

No, they don't like it when I'm down

There's a whole lot more for me waitin' on the other side
I'm always wonderin' if it feel like summer
I know maybe I'm too late, I could make it there some other time
I'll finally discover
That there's a whole lot more for me waitin'
That there's a whole lot more for me waitin'
I know maybe I'm too late, I could make it there some other time
Then I'll finally discover
That it ain't that bad, ain't so bad

While in the cell with Lil' Hakeem, after I slapped him I had told him
“I don't know how you get down with them clowns but I'm a soldier”
No one could understand, I had way too much aggression
That built over the years from my abandoned adolescence
See I done been lied to, backstabbed, and heartbroken
I wanted to cry but I was too afraid to open
Prayin’ one day I’d find a peace of mind by the ocean
I spent all my time committing crimes to get closer
While at my nana house I play the couch, starin' at the ceiling
Tryin’ not to get in my feelings
Thinkin' of a way I could make these millions
Maybe that'll take this pain away and clear up all these rainy days, yeah

No que caralho 'cê 'tava pensando? (Gangue)
Meu veículo é vermelho e o barulho é tipo uma montanha-russa
Hoje em dia, eu equilibrei todo o meu ódio junto com o amor
Hoje em dia, eu despejo toda a minha dor em um copo (Bebi)
Sonhador, esse só é um efeito colateral de quando 'cê tá nós (Jogo)
Fácil, os meus manos estão logo atrás de mim, e eles estão no limite
Acredite em mim, a gente mete o louco na cidade apenas pra ficar chapados (Ooh)
E eles ficam surpresos quando me vê vivo
Tenta aí, mas eu não posso ser morto Tentaram nove vezes, mas eu continuo aqui
Pula nesse carro, pode vir direto pra esse carro
Faço um hot box nesse carro, me deixa tipo ooh (Ooh)

Transando no oeste, traficando no oeste (Sim!)
Faca metálica de ouro, eu posso te matar no oeste (Sim)
Eu acabei de colocar um pente novo minha arma
Acabei de gozar na buceta dela, e agora ela está molhada
Eu costumava andar na parte de trás do busão (Sim), agora eu ando em um jatinho particular (Sim)

[Pós-Refrão: Young Thug]
Eu costumava pular pra fora do ônibus, agora eu pulo pra fora de um jato
Eu costumava dizer a ela: ""Amor, agora é só nós"", agora eu esqueci essa porra
Eu gostava dela, mas agora eu amo o jeito que ela bebe o meu gozo

Walk you 'round the foothills of my town
Probably feel like you've been there before
After hearing all the stories I've been telling you
For six months now

We'll probably have to sleep in separate bedrooms
Pack a shirt for church because we'll go
I'm not trying to scare you off but
I just thought that we should talk a few things out
Before we hit the road

[Chorus]
If I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She falls in love a little faster than I do
And my dad will check your tires
Pour you whiskey over ice and
Take you fishin' but pretend that he don't like you
Oh, if we break up I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine

[Verse 3]
My sister's gonna ask a million questions
Say anything she can to turn you red
And when you meet my high school friends
They'll buy you drinks and fill you in
On all the crazy nights I can't outlive

So if I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She falls in love a little faster than I do
And my dad will check your tires
Pour you whiskey over ice and
Buy you dinner but pretend that he don't like you
Oh, if we break up I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine

If I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She feels every heartache I go through
And if my dad sees me cryin'

I move mountains on my own, don't need nobody help
Changed your mind when I changed my life, better start believin' in myself
And we all out lookin' for, lookin' for God so we never see it in ourself
Shit, divine intervention move in stealth
It's hard to tell what the prayer compelled
You can find me dancin' in between the raindrops
Tryna find a way to make the pain stop

Got a nigga feeling brainwashed
My instability's trademark
Copy-written in all my decisions
This is not supposed to be a way of livin'
Turned my temple down into a prison, shit

Yeah, back on Vincent with the braces on
Used to slide out the back without the neighbors knowin'
Pose for the picture with the pearly whites
Dead lens zoomin' in, catchin' all my strikes
Used to trade Jordan for some molly
And she gave me all I need for the night, forties suffice
Morally alright, but I need some advice
And I know that I'm actin' foolish

Half a blunt, yeah, we coolin'
Twist it up, puttin' on OutKast
Hunnid, Texas heat, and yeah, we cruisin'

If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

[Verse 2]
Was never the right time, whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face

[Pre-Chorus]
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't

[Chorus]
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

[Bridge]
Would we be better off by now
If I'd have let my walls come down?
Maybe, I guess we'll never know
You know, you know

[Chorus]
Before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go",Lewis Capaldi,Lewis Capaldi,2020,[85],1
82,Those Kinda Nights,"[Intro: Bizarre & Ed Sheeran]
Damn, girl, with your sexy ass, haha
Let me holla at you
D.A. got that dope
It's one of those kinda nights

[Verse 1: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
Yes, this beat’s takin' me back to my D12 days
When we hit the club to go and hell-raise
Probably end up baggin' the cocktail waitress
And takin’ her straight back to the Motel-8
Yeah, Bizarre's tryna get a lap dance
Off a Xanax and Jack Dan' (Ayo)
Stripper walk by, I'm like ""Goddamn""
She's like ""That's harassment,"" I'm like ""Yeah, and?"" (Woo)
Holy Toledo, it's Miss Ohio
That’s the best ass I’ve seen in a while
We should be datin', she’s from Cleveland
But she's a bengal, this chick is catty
Is that a mini-skirt if it's a maxi?
That's the shortest thing for a dress since an addy (Since an addy)
She said ""Fuck off"" and threw her liquor at me
It’s one of those kinda nights
Then I said, I said

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then, the smoke and the bottle are on me, ah
Slip into the red dress you like
When we arrive, we probably won't leave, ah
I love the way you move like that
When you push your body on mine, oh my
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sun rise
It's one of those kinda nights

[Verse 2: Eminem]
This beat keeps takin' me back like my ex does
Only 'cause how good the sex was
Hit up the next club, met Alexa
But she was so extra, called her etcetera
Had her like, ""Oh my God
My whole iPod's filled with your songs, I mow my lawn to 'em""
I said, ""Oh my God, you know my songs?
That's totally awesome, I'm Marshall, what's goin' on? Ah (Haha)
Seriously though, jokes aside, how you doin'? You straight?""
She said, ""No, I'm bi""
She said, ""Are you drunk?,"" I said, ""No, I'm high
I'm checkin' out the chick,"" she said, ""So am I""
""What's in the cup, let me see that
Girl, where the rest of that promethazine at?""
She said, ""Cool, gotta run out to my Cadillac though
And I'll be like Fat Joe, and bring the lean back""
Then I said

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then, the smoke and the bottle are on me, ah
Slip into the red dress you like
When we arrive, we probably won't leave, ah
I love the way you move like that
When you push your body on mine, oh my
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sun rise
It's one of those kinda—

[Verse 3: Eminem]
OMG
Like the gas in the tank, she's gettin' low on me
Said she wants to go with me
I said, ""Go with you where?"" She said, ""Out""
I said, ""I'm a candle, I'll go out if you blow on me""
Walk her out to the parkin' lot, here comes the brigade
Turn like a flip page, Swifty look shitfaced
Say peace to McVay and me and this chick take off like a sick day
Drivin' around, I said, ""Let's pull over,"" she said, ""No problemo
Windows are dark tint, roll up the car windows""
Monte Carlo in park, bumpin' Bizarre's demo
Gettin' head in the bucket, Marshmello
Yeah, I never in the club met a woman worth knowin'
But if you're ho'in
Opposites attract, I'm someone, you're a no one
I'm high and you're bi, I'm comin', you're goin'

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then, the smoke and the bottle are on me, ah
Slip into the red dress you like
When we arrive, we probably won't leave, ah

Where I grew up, gettin' dressed up means
Buttoned down shirt and a good pair of jeans
Wasn’t Sunday supper without collard greens
Dad was boss, Christ is king
Friday night was livin' for them lights to come on
Then I turned to Miller Lites when I turned 21
There's some things about me that I can’t change
I'll always be the man that home made

[Chorus]
Home made me love a dirt road
Home made me crave some ice cold homemade
Sweet tea only mama knows how to make

Home made me wanna settle down in a home made

My pickup lines didn't seem to work
Guess my pickup truck must've got to her
Windows down, singin' every word

I don't wanna be alone, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)

[Verse 1]
Here I am, alone again
Can't get out of this hole I'm in
It's like the walls are closin' in
You can't help me, no one can
I can feel these curtains closin'
I go to open 'em
But something pulls 'em closed again
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
Feels like I'm loathing in Las Vegas
Haven't got the vaguest why I'm so lost
But I'd make you this small wager
If I bet you I'll be in tomorrow's paper
Who would the odds favor?
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
I'm so much like my father, you would think that I knew him
I keep pacin' this room, Valium, then chase it with booze
One little taste, it'll do
Maybe I'll take it and snooze, then tear up the stage in a few
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
Fuck the Colt 45, I'ma need somethin' stronger
If I pop any caps, it better be off of vodka
Round after round after round, I'm gettin' loaded (Haha)
That's a lot of shots, huh? (Double entendre)
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness (Yeah)
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)

[Verse 2]
Now I'm starin' at the room service menu off a benzo
I can hear the music continue to crescendo
I can see the whole fuckin' venue from my window
That's when you know you're schizo (Hello, darkness, my old friend)
'Cause I keep peekin' out the curtain from the hotel
The music is so loud
But it's almost as though I don't hear no sound
I should get ready for the show now
Wait, is this the whole crowd? I thought this shit was sold out
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
But it's only the opening act, it's early, don't overreact
Then something told me relax
And just hope for the show to be packed
Don't wanna hit the stage before they fill each row to the max
'Cause that'd be totally wack
You can't murder a show nobody's at (Hello darkness, my old friend)
But what if nobody shows? Panic mode
'Bout to snap and go motherfuckin' wacko at any second
'Bout to cancel the show just as fans below rush the entrance
Plan is a go to wreck shit, cameras in all directions (Hello, darkness, my old friend)
The press is 'bout to go ape shit, bananas on all the networks
Commando with extra clips, I got ammo for all the hecklers
I'm armed to the teeth, another Valium, fall off the bed
Hit the ground and crawl to the dresser
Alcohol on my breath as I reach for the scope
I'm blackin' out, I'm all out of meds
With them benzodiazepines gone
Now it's just magazines sprawled out on the floor
Fuck the media, I'm goin' all out, this is war
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness (Yeah)
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore (Hello, darkness, my old friend)

[Verse 3]
People start to show up, time to start the show up
It's 10:05 PM and the curtain starts to go up
And I'm already sweatin', but I'm locked and loaded
For rapid fire spittin' for all the concert-goers
Scopes for sniper vision, surprise from out of nowhere
As I slide the clip in from inside the hotel
Leanin' out the window, going Keyser Söze
Finger on the trigger, but I'm a licensed owner
With no prior convictions, so law says sky's the limit
So my supply's infinite, strapped like I'm a soldier
Got 'em hopping over walls and climbing fences
Some of them John Travolta, staying alive by inches
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
Cops are knockin', oh fuck, thought I blocked the entrance
Guess show time is over
No suicide note, just a note for target distance
But if you'd like to know the reason why I did this
You'll never find a motive, truth is I have no idea
I am just as stumped, no signs of mental illness
Just tryin' to show ya the reason why we're so fucked
'Cause by the time it's over, won't make the slightest difference
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore

Ayy, when you told me that you'd love me
Was I a fool to believe in you?
When you told me I was special
Was I dumb for trusting you?
When you told me that you want me
Did you really want me?
Or was this all a joke to you? (To you, to you)

[Интро: Young M.A & Eminem]
Вот, что мы делаем? Окей
Аминь!

[Куплет 1: Young M.A]
Мне нравятся сучки, которые любят тверкать, тверкать
Тряси, тряси, качай, качай
Нигга, мы добились успеха, добились успеха, они ненавидят это, ненавидят это
Я супер-про, сама настойчивость, ловец нала
Не люблю сравнения, не выношу ожидания, я заплачу за терпение
Но я ненавижу платить по счетам (Ненавижу это)
И я заработала миллион без контракта с мейджор-лейблом (Я сделала это)
Да, ее жопа фальшивая, но она пришла (Она пришла, уф)
Деньги не вещь, ведь они не реальны
Это лишь брокерский сленг (Хах)
И нет, ничего от ""Saweetie"", ни при чем здесь Quavo (Migo)
Чувак, я просто накурена, пусть мои шлюшки залягут на дно (Ууу)
Я просто хочу бабок, и я сейчас не про баб (Ууу)
Поступай правильно и уничтожь ее тело, режим Дрэйка (Привет)
Сука, я ем в ресторане, грей свою плиту молча (Привет)
Презираю твою жизни, пока состою в банде (Гррр)
Ты можешь покинуть эти земли, сука, я гребу бабло (Хах)
Я сладкая как торт (Ха), храбрая, как лев, у
Как дела Маршал? Я марсианин, режим Уэйна (Факты)
Шея в поту, капли стекают по лбу, я будто стою под дождем (Кап, кап, кап)
Восемь ниггеров, восемь хитов, возьми восемь душ (Бррр)
Собери песо и я свободна, так? (Уплачен)
Самодельные цели (Хэй)
Когда боль уходит (Хах)
Куда она идет? (Куда?)
Конец косяка, вот куда жаришка идет (There)
В небеса, вот куда мой мозг летит (Воу)
Та же стая, тот же дьявол, продающий ту же одежду. (Воу)
Пиноккио и мой ствол, одинаковый нос
Я и мои ниггеры должны есть, мы делим одну плиту (Что?)
Дело закрыто, трупы в переулке, сука, улочка перекрыта

[Куплет 2: Eminem]
Конец игры, Танос над вами, ШЛЮШКИ
Над моим дерьмо, но я не крашу пальцы ног (йе)
Захвати вантуз, ведь Маршалл и М.А залетают в трубы лихо
Зови нас Тирет-турбо, потому как даже Дре знает, что (Дре знает)
Бит вламывается как заряженный Detox, тебе понадобятся трое спецов
Полицейский надевает на меня наручники за уклонение, но я не останавливаюсь
Пожалуйста, чувак, мне нужно, чтоб вы все продолжали нести хуйню, я питаюсь ею
Я полная противоположность этим отсталым, которые плюются своими слабыми рифмами, я покидаю бойню
Каждая мысль будет настолько ядовитой, что вы поперхнетесь, суки
Заткну ваши пищеводы, перекрою доступ к кислороду
И надеру ваши задницы будто в боксерском зале
Присматривай получше за Slim'ом, лучше хлопай когда я снова в топе
Я не добью, отдам любому, кто захочет подойти и прикончить, и не подумаю вмешаться
Меня спрашивают, закончилась ли война с MGK? Конечно
Я очистил его от смертных грехов, Я Бог, а Господь прощает даже сатанистов
Я двигаюсь дальше, но ты знаешь, что твои угрызения совести исчезают, когда ты рождаешься с рогами Люцифера
И ты из школы Notorious, Puba, Cube, а The Poor Righteous Teachers обучали моих студентов
Показали им все «Чертежи» и «Формулы»
Но, похоже, чем больше они изучают мою музыку, тем больше напоминают мне глаза
И я смотрю, как зрачки расширяются
Но я подумываю о том, чтобы крикнуть ""Сбросить бомбы!"" в игре
Будто я в толпе перед концертом Арианы Гранде

[Припев: Eminem]
Вот идет Саддам Хусейн, Рухолла Хомейни
Где же Усама? Я был ладен с работой в последнее время
Посмотри, как я себя веду, они хотят, чтобы я ушел
Они хотят прикончить меня в моем же доме, я не мешаю
Черт, я не понимаю, почему они меня ненавидят
Я такой же клоун, как Джон Уэйн Гейси
Они называют меня сумасшедший Канье
APESHIT, Бейонсе, Джей-Зи
И я вернулся с Дре, детка
И его операционной
Но он никогда не надевает халата, от Снупа, до Шейди

[Куплет 3: Eminem]
Шейди как тень или твой силуэт, интеллект, я лучше проверю, почему ты расстроен
Потому что я познакомился с твоей сучкой в инете, и теперь у меня есть минет, как под головой подушка
Эта малышка Ким обхватила губами стояк, а затем дунула
Как на пыльный картридж от старой Нинтендо
Вот же были времена, но клянусь не стану бедным снова, неа
Я не курю, но у меня есть бумага, чтобы быть откровенным, я роллю Индику
И я держу ее одной запятой, ноль, ноль, ноль, ноль
Реально, реально, реально, убийство, убийство, убийство, убивать, убивать, убивать
Никелированный, двадцать второй, второй, второй
Сука, заткнись нахуй, пока я тебя тоже не пристрелил
Чтобы получить несколько просмотров на YouTube я не буду снимать хуйню
Или то как забегаю в церковь, пью, пью, пью
Потому что это то, что я де-ла-ю
Но даже для неподготовленного человеческого глаза
Мы с тобой разные, ты и я
Кто-то должен был объяснить тебе почему
Если пойдешь против меня, то это просто безумие, ты умрешь (Ага)
Вот почему меня называют камикадзе, это просто самоубийство, да
Но я знаю магию, и вот мой последний трюк
Я собираюсь сказать ""абракадабра"" и вытащить Кролика из своей шляпы
У меня вот-вот начнется рецидив, и держу пари, что ты не знаешь, как будешь реагировать
Но выражение отвращения, я не сомневаюсь, что оно появится
Как только я начну, блять, пожирать трек
И ты отвергаешь это из страха
Как сауды когда башни рухнули

[Припев: Eminem]
Вот идет Саддам Хусейн, Рухолла Хомейни

With a big old adios to wishes wasted on them falling stars

Because I try to minus the problems that I attract
And half the time the wheels that's in the back of my mind
Just keep on turning 'til the tires flat and burn until the fire crack
I do not lie though, facts may seem a little farfetched
That's only 'cause I may be make believe and full of darkness
When I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place
Walk and drop in change inside your empty guitar case
That's charity um, I move carelessly that's why I'm always tripping
I guess that's like electrolytes you help me go the distance
Not too efficient but the way it's always been
Until the day we have to meet again

The beauty starts to fade
The joy has turned to pain
I hear the symphony playin'
Ten thousand violins
Souls floating away like feathers in the wind

[Verse: Eminem]
They said my last album I sounded bitter
No, I sound like a spitter
Who ninety percent of
These hypocrites are tryna get rid of
But why would I get a chip on my shoulder?
I was considered, one time, as the illest
Bitch, I'm still as fly as your zipper
True, I just get richer
But if it was ever all about skrilla
Then I woulda quit a long motherfucking time ago
Bitch, shut the fuck up
I should go say that shit to Tech N9ne or to Jigga
Nobody said shit about 2 Chainz as long as he's been here, shit
No wonder you're mad, now I'm
Looking at them plaques, count 'em (Yeah)
I'm LL Cool J, Bigger and Deffer, that's how come (Uh)
I sell like four mil' when I put out a bad album (What?)
Revival flopped, came back and I scared the crap out 'em
But Rolling Stone stars, I get two and a half outta
Five, and I'll laugh out loud
'Cause that's what they gave BAD back in the day
Which actually made me not feel as bad now, 'cause
If it happened to James
It can happen to Shady
They do the same shit to Brady
More people hate me than love me
This game will make you go crazy
'Bout to go for B-R-O-K-E
I was the G, the O-A-T
Once I was played in rotation
At every radio station
They said I'm lyrically amazing
But I have nothing to say
But then when I put out Revival and I had something to say
They said that they hated the awake me
I lose the rage, I'm too tame
I get it back, they say I'm too angry
I need to get me some Dre beats
No, I should hook up with Tay Keith
Fans keep on pulling me one way
Haters pull me in another
Got more hooks in me than Swae Lee
'Bout to pick up some weights and lift 'til my tattoo of Hailie's face stretches
They said I'm just a whiner, I sound like a baby
I dish it out but can't take it
But I take it, dish it back out
And they get all bent out of shape
This shit's almost comical
Wait, and I meant no disrespect
I wasn't dissin' Tech, that was not a shot at 2 Chainz or to Jay-Z
They probably feel the same way because lately
Instead of us being credited for longevity
And being able to keep it up for this long at this level, we
Get told we'll never be what we were
Bitch, if I was as half as good as I was
I'm still twice as good as you'll ever be
Only way that you're ahead of me's alphabetically
'Cause if you diss me I'm coming after you like the letter V
Killing everything, play this tune, it's your eulogy
It's your funeral, prepare to die
This is music for you to be murdered by",Eminem,Eminem,2020,[67],1
102,I Can See,"[Verse 1]
I'm so close I can taste it
The man on the moon keep playing
Practical jokes, planting the mirrors and smoke
That I fade away in
You be complaining
And I can't explain it
I guess, nothin' compare to the feeling
The feeling amazing
Now I'm switchin' location
'Cause Heaven too far when you live in the basement
I'm lookin' for balance, I'm in an oasis
Well, I need somebody to save me, hmm
Before I drive myself crazy

[Chorus]
And now I know if life is but a dream then so are we
Show me something, show me something, show me something
And now I know if life is but a dream then so are we
Show me something, show me something, something I can see

[Verse 2]
Yeah, don't tell me to stop
Let me keep goin' until I cannot
Life is a fantasy until you wake up in shock
Hittin' the ground, I'm hittin' the ground, I fell from the top
You never expect to drop, so hold on, but
That just the way it goes, your God don't wait for no one
And when that's all you know, it keep you on your toes
You got so far to go, but look at where you came from

[Chorus]
And now I know if life is but a dream then so are we
Show me something, show me something, show me something
And now I know if life is but a dream then so are we
Show me something, show me something, something I can see",Mac Miller,Mac Miller,2020,[68],1
103,In Too Deep,"[Verse 1]
""This could never work,"" is what we said at first
But whatever this is, it's working
But we're in two different worlds and (Yeah)
I'm not your husband (Nah), you ain't my girlfriend
All I know is that (What?)
When I'm with you, I'm a different person, yeah
And I ain't never met a chick as perfect
Girl, you're a ten, so here I am (Yeah)
Laying here with her again
Thinking 'bout you
She's asleep, you're texting me around two
Crying face emoji, you say, ""This is me without you""
We're sneaking out to meet at cheap hotel rooms or
Sex in the car, then I'll text you tomorrow
Do I question it? Nah, no objection at all
'Cause both of us are still involved, so
As I'm peelin' off, all I'm thinking 'bout is

[Chorus]
I'm not happy here (Nah), with her
Rather have you (Yeah), rather have me too
'Cause you're not happy there (You're not happy there), with him
Rather have me (I know, but), we’re just in too deep

[Verse 2]
You're laying there with him, thinking 'bout me
He's asleep, you say, ""Let's meet around three""
You went to leave the house, he caught you sneaking out, now he's freaking out
You thought he was sleepin' soundly, woah
You say you're going for a drive, you don't question him
When he stumbles in, like, ""Where the fuck you've been?""
Then you pump his ear with what he wants to hear
Tell him you love him, yeah, wipe each other's tears
But it's been a couple years since we been doin' dirt
You or my girl, don't wanna see either of you get hurt
But now the lines are getting super blurred
Can't tell if I'm cheating on her with you or cheating on you with her
But really, nobody's at fault, can't help who you love
Hope they don't overhear us talk
'Cause we both are getting sloppy
Probably subconsciously part of me's hoping we get caught 'cause

[Chorus]
I'm not happy here (Nah), with her
Rather have you (Yeah), rather have me too
'Cause you're not happy there (You're not happy there), with him
Rather have me (I know, but), we’re just in too deep

[Verse 3]
We're laying here with them, thinking 'bout us
'Cause now when we get home, we get jealous
Of each other being someone else's
Call us Long John Silver's 'cause we selfish
But I just wanna see ya
Don't care if it's at the Ritz or Motel 6
If I'm there with ya, rich or poor
When I'm laying here with ya, it could be the kitchen floor
I could stay in bed with ya starin' at ya 'til the morn'
I just wanna be your secret lover, yeah
I'd rather share ya than to not have you at all
So once a year or twice a month I'm here if you want it
Yeah, I'm open season
And I'm always game, so I keep it a hundred, dear, haha
'Cause we could never be each other's everythings, you got a wedding ring
So it's him instead of me, but I'll be your second string, now and forever because

[Chorus]
I'm not happy here (Nah), with her
Rather have you (Yeah), rather have me too
'Cause you're not happy there (You're not happy there), with him
Rather have me (I know, but), we’re just in too deep (I'm in way too deep)",Eminem,Eminem,2020,[71],1

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah, things like this ain't built to last
I might just fade like those before me
When will you forget my past?
Got questions, ask, you know the stories
And you need to let me know
When you're leaving, where you go
Can I come?
Do you believe me, are you close?
Yeah, even if you don't
That'll get you sprung

[Chorus]
Do I, do I, do I love?
Can I, can I, can I get enough?

[Verse 2]
Yeah, don't run away, love
Hate love, heartbreak will have you bankrupt
Too many days in a daze, better wake up
I put your face in a place where the space was
Nobody makes you feel like you but (Do I?)
And you don't know what you should do
You just lookin' for someone to make you move, ooh, tell me (Do I?)
I make this planet feel like home
It's us versus time, the door is closing
So far beyond all our control
You saved a soul so close to broken
It's so much better when you wait
Forever and a day, that's all I got
Put it together then it break
All the energy it take, it never stop

[Chorus]
Do I, do I, do I love?
Can I, can I, can I get enough?

[Bridge]
Yeah, I never slip, I never fall
I tried to tell you 'bout a better life
And get involved big or small
It's been my fault, I keep it safe, it's in the vault
Blindfolded, keep it going 'til we hit a wall, yeah
I'm never going through the motions
I'm just tryna lay your body down slowly
We can only go up
We can only go up

Everybody's gotta live
And everybody's gonna die
Everybody's gotta live
I think you know the reason why
Yeah, sometimes the going gets so good, yeah
But then again it get pretty rough, yeah
But when I have you in my arms, baby

Everybody's gotta live

Saw a blind man standin' on the corner, baby, yeah
And he couldn't hardly tie his shoes, yeah
Harmonica and guitar strapped around his neck
But he sure could, he sure could play the blues

Everybody's gotta live
And everybody's gonna die
Everybody's gonna try to have a good, good time
I think you know the reason why, yeah

[Verse 3]
Feel like I've seen a million sunsets, yeah
If you're with me I'll never go away
That's when I stopped and I took a look at my baby
She said, ""If you're with me, I won't go away""

106,Marsh,"[Intro]
My name is Marsh and this world, I'm out of it (Out of it)
'Cause with all this A-B-C shit, I'm starting to sound like ALF a bit
Ha, I kill me, this medicine's counterfeit
I was mislead by the sound of it, how am I gonna get turnt up on this Valium shit? (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Checked in at the Royal Garden
To chill and avoid my problems
Until paranoia caused me
To feel like I'm going bonkers
For real, think my toilet's talkin'
I spilled like, like forty bottles
Of pills, think your boy is startin'
To feel like a spoiled carton of milk
'Cause it just occurred
My girl's cheatin', I'm kickin' that fucking bitch to the curb
But the word ""fucking"" ain't meant to be a descriptive word
The type of bitch she is, ain't no adjective, it's a verb
Ho thinks her snatch is magical
But that's how she attracts men, though
Traps 'em and attack similar to an actual arachnid
Or a vaginal tarantula or black widow
In fact, it'll be nothin' to throw that lil' bitch with a capital B out the back window
Of the black Cadillac limo like a whack demo
When I'm strapped, when I spit rapid, like a ratchet
A halfwit, I'll aim at, then I'll
Been fire bitch, I can outrap Reynolds
A pad and pen'll be great, but a napkin'll do
Return of the whack sicko
Head spinnin' like Invisibl Skratch Piklz
Yeah, Shady's back, see the bat signal
It's time to go bat shit, like you accidentally ate a Louisville slugger and crapped it
I'd like to introduce myself
Hi there, bitch...

[Chorus]
My name is Marsh and, I'm out this world (This world)
S on my chest (Superman) like it's plural (It's lit)
Call me extra, extraterrestrial
Extra, extra, extraterrestrial (Skrrt, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I could keep beefin', fuck is the point?
I could make it really difficult for motherfuckers to come to Detroit
If you're still looking for smoke, I already gave you an L
I'd rather just see you in Hell, but I should get Puff on the joint (Diddy)
Wait, run it back, I said give you an L, inhale
Puff on the joint, I am the blunt you avoid
Used to get jumped for my ProWings
When I was growing up they said a Slinky's a wonderful toy
My mother thought I was such a fun little boy
""Oh, what a bundle of joy""
Until the morning she suffered a punch in the groin
From a tantrum I was throwing
Like a motherfuckin' disgruntled employee
I don't cut the beat 'til I fuckin' destroy it
Once I get going, rain, thunder, it's storming
Puddles are forming, I hear somebody's voice
In my head, say it's still a dream
Then he said kill emcees
Trippie Redd, with pills and lean
Sipping meds in the limousine
Getting head, guillotine

[Chorus]
My name’s Marsh and, I'm out this world (This world)
S on my chest (Superman) like it's plural (It's lit)
Call me extra, extraterrestrial (Yeah)
Extra, extra, extraterrestrial

Yeah
So all of y'all can just suck a penis (Suck a penis)
I'll do the opposite (I'll do the opposite)
Eat you pussies like cunnilingus (Like cunnilingus)
There ain't no stoppin' it (There ain't no stoppin' it)
They say I'm such a genius (They say I'm such a genius)
When that Kamikaze hit (When that Kamikaze hit)
Now they call me ""butterfingers"" (They call me ""butterfingers"")
'Cause I just keep droppin' shit (I just keep droppin' shit)
You wanna butt heads? Shut up, Beavis, haha
I got your bitch with her butt out
I'm hittin' a lick 'cause she stickin' her tongue out (Bitch)
You got no hitters, you might be pitchin' a shut out
She 'bout to give up the dugout (Yeah)
I should just live in a nuthouse
Right now, I live in an igloo (Yeah)
And I'm not chillin' the fuck out
Treat you like a stepparent, does to a stepchild with red hair and
Plus I get dough like Ed Sheeran, so call me the ginger bread man
I'm a stan of Redman, X-Clan and I'm a Treach fan
But I look up to myself (Yeah)
Like a fucking headstand (Yeah)
So why, w-w-why else would I call myself an alien?
How could I hit a dry spell? (Yeah), I'm named after the wetlands

[Chorus]
I'm Marsh and, I'm out this world (This world)

Tu sais, si j'avais une chance de tout recommencer (Oh, oh)
Je ne changerais rien (Oh, oh)
D.A. a trouvé cette drogue
Je crie sans regret

[Refrain: Don Toliver]
Tu as traversé le plus dur, l'ego a été le plus gros, je t'ai fait une star (je crie n'avoir aucun regret)
J'ai avancé lentement, j'ai essayé de faire profil bas, les Vette ressemblent à une tempête (crier sans regrets)
Je t'ai fait subir des trucs stupides, tu crois que je fais de la merde (je n'ai pas de regrets)
Je me sens si seule, comme si j'étais perdue, comme si-

[Couplet 1: Eminem & Don Toliver]
Ouais, l'ancien moi leur manque
Je pense qu'ils veulent que je fasse une overdose de codéine
Ils veulent que ma vie soit bouleversée comme en 2003
Ils veulent des sièges au premier rang, je leur donne des saignements de nez
Ils veulent que j'implose, que j'explose, que je me déteste, que je m'érode
Je leur crie dessus sans regrets et j'accuse
J'arrache mes vêtements
J'ai dû aller voir le doc comme Kool Moe Dee (Ouais)
Jamais fallu grand-chose pour convaincre Dre
Jamais été influencé par la couleur ou les teintes de la peau
Depuis le premier jour, Hellraiser avec les deux lames d'un sensei
Abandonner, no comprende (Woo)
Cerveau en conserve, probablement baisé dans la membrane
L'esprit de Slim Sha est dans un trou, mais il est fou
Jeu de stylo comme si je venais de frapper dans le dixième bloc ( Criant sans regrets)
Ouais, je vis sur le bord, je m'assois sur le rebord
Pour vous chier sur la tête, j'ai été sur le banc
Pardonner et oublier est la seule chose que je pourrais regretter
L'enfer a voulu se venger, tu m'as laissé pour mort
J'ai rampé hors de ma tombe, tu ferais mieux d'être prêt et de te préparer
Mes ennemis ne m'ont pas encore mis à terre (je crie n'avoir aucun regret)

[Refrain: Don Toliver & Eminem]
Tu as traversé le plus dur, l'ego a été le plus gros, je t'ai fait une star (je crie n'avoir aucun regret)
J'ai avancé lentement, j'ai essayé de faire profil bas, les Vette ressemblent à une tempête (crier sans regrets, ouais, pas d'excuses, je ne reprends pas la merde)
Je t'ai fait subir des trucs stupides, tu crois que je fais de la merde (je n'ai pas de regrets)
Je me sens si seule, comme si j'étais (ouais) perdue

[Couplet 2: Eminem]
Toute la haine, je ne peux pas dire exactement d'où elle vient
Mais ça recommence, hein ?
Vous étiez tous dans mon coin
Maintenant tu viens de me soutenir dans un
Des témoins innocents, je vais forcément frapper
Pour certains adversaires, je porte de gros calibre
Donc certaines cibles auront le tir mortel
Certains, je les ai à peine touchés
Je peux faire une erreur et exploser et finir par chier
Ou dire des conneries, penser que je dirige de la merde
J'ai perdu ma colère pour faire subir à Earl et Tyler, le Créateur, le plus gros du travail (Ouais)
Je n'aurais jamais dû faire une réponse, j'aurais dû viser les faux
Ce sont des traîtres, car les serpents ne sont que des connards
Ils peuvent se faire baiser avec huit cents putains de vibomasseur à la fois (Ouais)
Et pour tous ceux qui ont frôlé la mort
Et je ne peux pas écouter ""Arose"" sans pleurer
Pour ceux qui se sentent bas comme si vous étiez en pleine crise d'angoisse
Mais c'est seulement pour ceux que j'inspire
Arme jamais dégainée sans tirer
Ma volonté je l'impose, les ennemis vont se sentir comme dans les affres d'un lion de montagne
Ils parlent de mes filles qui espèrent que je m'envoie des shot (Shot)
Parce que ma première pensée est de piétiner et d'écrire mille punchlines
Mais parfois, c'est comme si on laissait tomber une enclume sur un château de cartes
Ou Godzilla écrasant un croûton avec des bottes de combat
Ou larguer une putain de bombe nucléaire sur une fourmilière
(Je crie n'avoir aucun regrets) Je ne peux pas le faire, nan

[Refrain: Don Toliver & Eminem]
Tu as traversé le plus dur, l'ego a été le plus gros, je t'ai fait une star (je crie n'avoir aucun regret, a tout pris)
J'ai avancé lentement, j'ai essayé de faire profil bas, les Vette ressemblent à une tempête (crier sans regrets, ouais, pas de regrets, mais pas de drapeau blanc non plus)

'Cause I'm getting green, Incredible Hulk
'Cause I usually get it in bulk
But I still will stomp your head to a pulp (Yeah)

So get ready to die from second hand
Get a whiff of the doctor's medicine
Like sedatives you'll get popped, Excedrin

Like I just left the damn concession stand (Yeah)
A mic in my hand's a weapon (What?)

Every single one of you
Whether separate or all of you band together

Meaning abortions that live 'cause they were still born

Where are you goin'? Can I come too?
The whole world is open, a playground for me and you
And we could be fine, shit, who the hell knows?
It's your eyes and your ears and your mouth and your nose
Head and your shoulders, your knees and your toes
I dream of this moment
Will it come true?

110,Stepdad,"[Intro]
Ayo
(This a song about)
My, my stepdad
(Let's see if this ever happened to you)
I, I hate
My, my stepdad

[Verse 1]
One thing that sticks in my craw
When I was six and I saw my stepfather hittin' my Ma
Socked her right in her eyeball
I'm startin' to think I'm psychotic
With all the pictures I draw of
Shit that I've already witnessed, it’s probably twisted my thoughts
All I can hear is drama with Mom and him
I can always hear 'em arguin' down the hallways
The walls are thin so the noise is startin' to feel like the norm
Our dog pissed on the carpet, he stomped it so hard
Doctors had to put it down
He killed my chihuahua, this motherfucker!

[Chorus]
I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (Stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', ""Bye-bye stepdad"" (Stepdad)

[Verse 2]
Outside, I look like I'm calm
Inside, I'm a tickin' time bomb
'Cause of this motherfucker, who sticks his dick in my mom (My mom)
Last night, he said I left the kitchen light on
But he walked in there this morning and purposely flipped it, I saw him
Hickory switch to my bottom, I counted sixty-nine times
He swatted me with it, I'd cry
He just started hittin' me harder
God, I wish I could just jaw him
If I could get my weight up
But I'm just a second grader
This prick is bigger than I am
But I've been readin' at school about this shit called liquid cyanide
I'm fantasizin' at night when he's sleepin' at just the right time
Sneak up with a lethal injection
And put him down like they did to my dog
I'm talkin' euthanasia (Euthanasia), like kids in Taiwan
This fuckin' shit's like Saigon (Saigon)
Neighbors called police on him
So many battery charges, this dude's like lithium-ion
Then Mom and him let bygones (Bygones)
Just be bygones
So on eggshells, I walk and just try not to piss this guy off
But this is why I...

[Chorus]
I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (Stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', ""Bye-bye stepdad"" (Stepdad)

[Verse 3]
So this year, I'm goin' into the fifth and I'm tall
I'm five foot six on my block, I'm the toughest kid but I got
Way bigger fish to fry
Which is why I'm tryin' to get this bitch to fly off
The handle and wait for the fist to fly to put this guy in a pine box
He's always lookin' for chaos but tonight I've cooked up a plan
So this Christmas, I got some color books and some crayons
I'm layin' on the floor, in the living room with some friends colorin'
He walks by, kicks my arm and goes, ""Oops"" and just laughs
I yelled for Mom (Mom) and as she's rushin' to my defense
I stood up and said, ""Fuck you, punk"" and I took off and ran
To my bedroom, as I fled
Knowin' shit would hit the fan
Slammed the door and hid behind it with an aluminum bat
He kicked it in
I swung it hard as I could at his head
His noodle went splat, he fell right at the foot of my bed
I'm a little bit scared but my anger's overtooken the fear
I threw down the bat and just started whoopin' his ass
Beat him with my bare hands, the big bad wolf ain't so bad
""Ding-dong,"" the pussy is dead, the bully finally gets his
Stomped him until he pissed enough to fill a two-liter with
Then buried him next to my dog
And if I go to juvie for this, I'ma tell 'em

[Chorus]
I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (Stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', ""Bye-bye stepdad"" (Stepdad)
'Cause I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (Stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', ""Bye-bye stepdad"" (Stepdad)",Eminem,Eminem,2020,[93],1
111,Take What You Want,"[Intro: Post Malone]
[Harmonizowanie]

[Refren: Ozzy Osbourne]
Czuję, jak kruszysz się w mych rękach, aż do twego serca z kamienia
Wykrwawiłaś mnie do sucha, tak jak łzy, których nie ukazujesz
Dlaczego nie weźmiesz tego, czego ode mnie chcesz?
Wziąć tego, co chcesz ode mnie
Wziąć tego, co chcesz i pójść
Dlaczego nie weźmiesz tego, czego ode mnie chcesz?
Wziąć tego, co chcesz ode mnie
Wziąć tego, co chcesz i pójść

[Zwrotka 1: Post Malone]
Nigdy niczego nie potrzebowałem od Ciebie
I wszystko, o co zapytałem było dla prawdy (Wszystko, o co zapytałem było)
Pokazałaś swój język, był w parze rozwidlony
Twój jad był śmiertelny, prawie tobie uwierzyłem (Prawie tobie uwierzyłem)
Tak, żerowałaś na każdym moim błędzie
Czekałaś na mnie, powstrzymywałaś mnie od wierzenia, że utonę
Marnowałem siebie, jak plagę
Próbuję szukać swojej drogi do wyjścia, szukać swojej drogi do wyjścia (Szukać swojej drogi do wyjścia)

[Pre-Refren 1: Post Malone]
I nareszcie przyszedł ten dzień
Zacząłem oddawać swoje serce
Na litość boską, kości mi się złamią
Ale nigdy nie nabędziesz mojej duszy, nie-e

[Refren: Post Malone]
Czuję, jak kruszysz się w mych rękach, aż do twego serca z kamienia
Wykrwawiłaś mnie do sucha, tak jak łzy, których nie ukazujesz
Dlaczego nie weźmiesz tego, czego ode mnie chcesz?
Wziąć tego, co chcesz ode mnie
Wziąć tego, co chcesz i pójść
Dlaczego nie weźmiesz tego, czego ode mnie chcesz?
Wziąć tego, co chcesz ode mnie
Wziąć tego, co chcesz i pójść

[Zwrotka 2: Travis Scott]
Wziąłem kamienie, którymi rzucałaś, zrobiłem łańcuchy dla ekipy (Lód)
Wziąłem ze sobą dziesięć dziwek, ta fura była stworzona dla dwóch (Tak, panie)
Przebiegały przez nią, nic nie pozostało do zrobienia
Potrzebuję więcej powodów, aby żyć tego wieczoru (Prosto w górę!)
Ja piłem na zawsze i brałem cokolwiek
Wierzyłem o myśleniu, że ty kiedyś wrócisz
Pójdźmy naszymi własnymi drogami, którąkolwiek
Mówisz, że jak, to jakkolwiek długo
Bo wiesz, że ja nigdy nie będę sam (Tak)

[Pre-Refren 2: Travis Scott]
Miłość (Miłość, tak)
Laska będzie się ruszać (Laska będzie, laska będzie się ruszać)
Potrzebuję tego na widoku (Potrzebuję tego na, potrzebuję tego na widoku)
Zepsuj to wszystko (Zepsuj to, zepsuj to wszystko)
Daj jej tą lufkę (Daj jej tą, daj jej tą lufkę)
Cały mój gang (Cały mój, cały mój gang)
Laska stała się zła (Laska stała się, laska stała się zła)

[Refren: Ozzy Osbourne z Postem Malonem]
Czuję, jak kruszysz się w mych rękach, aż do twego serca z kamienia
Wykrwawiłaś mnie do sucha, tak jak łzy, których nie ukazujesz
Dlaczego nie weźmiesz tego, czego ode mnie chcesz?
Wziąć tego, co chcesz ode mnie
Wziąć tego, co chcesz i pójść
Dlaczego nie weźmiesz tego, czego ode mnie chcesz?
Wziąć tego, co chcesz ode mnie
Wziąć tego, co chcesz i pójść

[Outro: Post Malone i Ozzy Osbourne]
Weź to wszystko
Dlaczego nie (Weź to, co chcesz, weź to, czego potrzebujesz)
Weź to, czego potrzebujesz ode mnie, tak
(Weź to, co chcesz) Dlaczego nie (Weź to, czego potrzebujesz)

Everywhere a nigga take you, just know that my face good
Modify your energy so your bank and your skin glow

If you're waitin' on love, then you waitin' for a while
If your neighbors wake up, then we gotta turn it down
So you say I'm the type you like keepin' around
You like keepin' around

[Chorus]
Late at night, eleven, we're cruisin'
Lately, I've been watchin' your movements
If I'm the only one that you're choosin'
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin'?
Late at night, eleven, we're cruisin'
Lately, I've been watchin' your movements
If I'm the only one that you're choosin'
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin'?

[Bridge]
Ooh, don't you forget about me
Ooh, don't you forget about me
Ooh, don't you forget about me
Ooh, don't forget about me
Ooh, don't you forget about me
Ooh, don't forget about me, yeah
Ooh, don't you forget about me
Ooh, don't you forget about me

[Chorus]
Late at night, eleven, we're cruisin'
(Lately, I've been watchin' your, watchin' your)
If I'm the only one that you're choosin'
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin'?

[Outro]
Don't you forget about me
If I'm the only one that you're
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin', usin'?
If I'm the only one that you're
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin', usin'?
Don't you forget about me
If I'm the only one that you're
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin', usin'?
If I'm the only one that you're
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin', usin'?",Khalid,Khalid,2020,[83],1

123,Leave Em Alone,"[Intro: PnB Rock]
Hitmaka
Ow
I see
Girl, you out here tryna be my wifey
I'ma eat that pussy like it’s ice cream
Bet you ain't met a nigga like me

[Verse 1: Layton Greene]
No need to say what I been through
He already know what I'm into
He be reading my mind like it’s simple
Got him banging my line like it's his too
Never gotta worry 'bout no issues
He pay it on time when the rent due
Made him ice out my neck and the wrist too
Hold down your pussy and your pistol (Let him know, girl)

[Pre-Chorus: PnB Rock]
I see
Girl, you out here tryna be my wifey
I'ma eat that pussy like it's ice cream
Bet you ain't met a nigga like me

[Chorus: Layton Greene]
I can't leave 'em alone
Try to change my ways, but the dope boy turnin’ me on
Trap niggas know what I want
So caught up that I can’t leave 'em alone (Can’t leave 'em alone)
Try to change my ways, but the dope boy turnin' me on
Trap niggas know what I want
So caught up that I can't leave ’em alone

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Why you tryna leave me alone?
I'm a D-boy, you know that come with doin' you wrong
Nah, I'm playin', you should know that we been in this too long
And all your friends really wish that they was on what we on
Girl, you know I got that deep stroke, that heart skip a beat stroke
That put us both to sleep stroke, forget about him, he broke
Serious as they come, I don't play no jokes
Middle of the winter, I'll give that ass a heatstroke, yeah (Let 'em know)

[Pre-Chorus: PnB Rock]
I see
Girl, you out here tryna be my wifey
I'ma eat that pussy like it's ice cream
Bet you ain't met a nigga like me

[Chorus: Layton Greene]
I can't leave 'em alone
Try to change my ways, but the dope boy turnin' me on
Trap niggas know what I want
So caught up that I can't leave 'em alone (Can't leave 'em alone)
Try to change my ways, but the dope boy turnin' me on
Trap niggas know what I want
So caught up that I can't leave 'em alone

[Verse 3: Yung Miami]
Jackrabbit when he put the dick in it
How you nut and you barely put the tip in it?
Sixty seconds, got him gone, that's a quick minute
He ain't never felt some pussy with some grip in it
Hair done, nails done like a bad bitch
Broke niggas turned me to a savage
I can't fuck him if he average
Way more bad than your last bitch (Period)

[Chorus: Layton Greene]
I can't leave 'em alone
Try to change my ways, but the dope boy turnin' me on
Trap niggas know what I want
So caught up that I can't leave 'em alone (Can't leave 'em alone)
Try to change my ways, but the dope boy turnin' me on
Trap niggas know what I want
So caught up that I can't leave 'em alone

[Outro: Hitmaka]
I swear we not tryin'
Ayy, yo, 4Rest, let's go grab homegirl from the front, you know what I'm sayin'?
'Cause, uh
I'ma need her right here, tuh

124,Conversations In The Dark,"[Verse 1]
Talk, let's have conversations in the dark
World is sleeping, I'm awake with you, with you
Watch movies that we've both already seen
I ain't even looking at the screen
It's true, I got my eyes on you

[Pre-Chorus]
And you say that you're not worth it
You get hung up on your flaws
Well, in my eyes, you are perfect as you are

[Chorus]
I won't ever try to change you, change you
I will always want the same you, same you
Swear on everything I pray to
That I won't break your heart
I'll be there when you get lonely, lonely
Keep the secrets that you told me, told me
And your love is all you owe me
And I won't break your heart

[Verse 2]
On Sunday mornings we sleep in 'til noon
Oh, I could sleep wherever next to you, next to you
And we, we got places we both gotta be
But there ain't nothing I would rather do
Than blow off all my plans for you

[Pre-Chorus]
And you say that you're not worth it
And get hung up on your flaws
But in my eyes, you are perfect as you are
As you are

[Chorus]
I won't ever try to change you, change you
I will always want the same you, same you
Swear on everything I pray to
That I won't break your heart
I'll be there when you get lonely, lonely
Keep the secrets that you told me, told me
And your love is all you owe me

I'm not the one I think you should fuck with
Just lettin' you know in advance (No)
I got a goon holdin' a burner
You can get left with a tan (Fire)
He a junkie for the dumb shit (How?)
Want all the smoke like a strand (Dope)
Just protecting the brand (You gotta protect the brand)
Too much to count right now, I don't got enough hands

They dissin', I know that they wishin' I give 'em a chance

Get the drop, go hit up his block (Right now)
The chopper hold ninety-nine plus one
That's a 100 some shots for a opp (Brr)
Put on for my city every time I drop
Couple niggas stuck and they mad that I'm not
Hate that I'm hot like what's under the pot
Got 'em where I want 'em, I hear that a lot

Big speaker, big stepper, still in rotation with the trappers and the jackers
Hot boy ridin' with the pump, asthma
Double R truck, red seats, plasma
I'm hittin' a bitch from the back, got her sayin' the brand
And free all the bros out the can (Gang)
Never see him, so we clappin' his mans like hands
Why would you play with the clan?
F and the N, A and the R
Infrared beam, it glow in the dark
Put in the work and don't tell what you saw
I'm a big driver, controllin' the car (Big bands)
They ridin', I'm wrong or right (Don't matter)

You know the brand, we winnin' (Let's go)
Better ask 'bout DaBaby and see what they say
That lil' nigga ain't playin', he wit' it (Yeah)
Nigga know I keep fire on me 24/7
You get cooked like a pan, a skillet by protecting the brand
How you standin' on that? I come step on you like you a pair of tennis (Okay)
Ain't that what they call it in Memphis? (Uh-huh)
Know a few niggas ballin' in Memphis (Ball)
Got a bag, I'm with Bagg, I'ma let you know (Yeah)
If I pull that bitch out, I'ma let it blow (Boom)
Nigga, you know I'm hot, and my bitch a hot girl
We'll pop out like we Meg and Yo
It was time to go right by the brand and your boy showed his hand
That lil' nigga was scared to go
I think these niggas scared of the label
Got a brand with my brand, way ahead of your label
We made niggas famous
Put one of yo ass on the news, now your mama scared of the cable
Ayy, baby, what you gon' do if a nigga walk down

It's probably cheaper to keep her

Champagne and rolled-up notes
شامپاین میزنیم و پولای رول شده رو آماده میکنیم
Prenups and broken homes
توافقای قبل از ازدواج و زوج هایی که از همدیگه طلاق گرفتن
Surrounded, but still alone
کلی آدم دور و برمونه، اما هنوزم تنهایییم
Let's leave the party
بیا این پارتی رو ول کنیم بریم

[Post-Chorus: Ed Sheeran, Both, Khalid]
That's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
این رفتار اون کسی که هستیم نیستش (ما هستیم، هستیم، هستیم)
We are not beautiful, yeah
ما خوشگل (پولدار) نیستیم
Yeah, that's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
اره، این رفتار اون کسی که هستیم نیستش (ما هستیم، هستیم، هستیم)

Eu derrubei esses caras igual uns dominós

A pedra no anel dela me deixa disléxico
Pega o din', preciso protege-lo
Levei minha mão, mas não me arrependo
Essas vadias mentindo só querem me dar
Só estão tentando me pegar
Querem as roupas e a receita
Eu quero o pão igual o gergelim

Solía mantenerlos cerca, ahora están muertos para mí (Maldición)
Solía tener amigos, ahora tengo enemigos (Uh)
Enemigos, sí, es muy triste

[Verso 1: Post Malone]
Decían que no llegaría tan lejos, ah, ah
¿Piensan que no vemos quiénes son, son, son?
Riendo al banco como ja, ja, ja
Supongo que solo estoy hablando mucho, bla, bla, bla  (Cállate la puta boca)
Entonces, ¿a dónde fueron? (Uh)
Cuando estaba en bancarrota no podía ni comprar cigarrillos
Ahora tu mamá necesita boletos para mi concierto en el estadio (Concierto en el estado)
A ella le encanta cuando me escucha en la radio, oh
Sé que es difícil tragarse su orgullo
Me disculpo porque no puedes superarme (Superarme)
Ahora estás fuera de mi vida, estoy tan aliviado, yo

Solía tener amigos, ahora tengo enemigos (Maldición)
Solía mantenerlos cerca, ahora están muertos para mí (Uh)

Cerca de mis enemigos (Vamos)
Necesito mejor energía (¿Eh?)
Cuando te dije que te jodieras, pensaste que estaba jugando, ¿eh?
(Sí, sí) Pero lo decía literal
Ella quiere quedar, le dije a la mierda eso (No)
Ella me mira como si estuviera sorprendida
Empaquetan el correo y estoy solo en casa
Cuando la caja toca la puerta, van por 35
Trato de poner de mi parte para mis compañeros, se convierten en enemigos antes de que el ojo de un negro lo haga
Alcanzas un batido, voy a sostener un puño
Dándole a un negro un cuarto de libra sin las papas fritas
Acabo de conseguir doble platino sin colaboraciones
Sólo para mostrarle a un negro que en realidad no lo necesito
Pásale a un hombre un plato y puede hacerlo temblar
Está garantizado que se doblará y morderá la mano que lo alimenta
Y sé que piensas que no lo veo
Y sé que tu perra no tiene auto
Me estás obligando a que vaya y le compre un pequeño Prius
Follemos frente a la cámara, podemos llamarlo incluso
Los amigos son como el otoño, cada año se van
Y voy a rastrillarlos en una pila, tirarlos en una bolsa
Atarlos junto a sus perras y dejarlos
Porque la mayoría de estos negros son engañosos
Y yo (Uh)

Es demasiado tarde para cambiar esta mierda (Demasiado tarde)
Así que no intentes decirme que estás feliz por mí ahora

I feel like the greatest
Only been at this for two years, thank God this shit happened so quick
Fashion me the latest, money comin' in but so do hatred
Shit ain't how I pictured, but I faced it
Emotions, I erased it, fuck havin' feelings, I replaced it
Should've peeped that fu' shit from the basis
This when the mistakes hit, tired of gettin' caught up in this fake shit
I just can't sit comfy with no snake shit

[Refrain]
I been holdin' demons inside, I can't lie
So if you ain't ready to die, then don't try
I gotta make it home so my mama don't cry
I'd rather do the sentence, least time'll go by
Feel the pain, so numb, I don't feel nothin'
Shooters still runnin' 'round with no chill button
Still be totin' in the town, finna drill somethin'
Let a nigga run up on me thinkin' I won't kill somethin'

And I keep the gang with me, try it, bet we air shit
Everybody get it, if it's static, we don't spare shit
Really on my bully, 2020, we ain't playin'
Now it's lit for everything, don't care 'bout what you sayin'
Mama, she was prayin', I was on that block late
Really put in twenty years of work, but then I got weight
Sunday I ain't never go to church because that block pay
Big .40 cal' in my shirt, no karate
Fuck what the opps say, fuck what the cops say
Big Smelly drive, E for E, that's the block way
If you feel a way, grrt-baow what the Glock say
All my niggas tryna get the bag, fuck the pop way

I just want my name to be around when I ain't here
Livin' in the moment, but I want this shit for years

Words that they did not say, dick suckin' crazy
Everybody tryna beach for clout like it's wavy
Guess I'm just too real, I stood solid, how they made me
I can never be a goofy nigga if they paid me
Songs too heat now, everything is wavy
Lot of niggas think it's competition, they amaze me
I was goin' downhill, jail kinda saved me
Gotta keep the hard work, ain't no gettin' lazy
Smokin' opposition kinda sorta got me dazy
Think you'd last a day up in my shoes, then nigga, trade me
Bitch, I need a billion in blues like I'm JAY-Z
Huh, R.I.P. to Mavy
Bitch, I'm cookin' now, got the sauce like it's gravy
If you want a feature, get your money right and pay me
Still, when the time come, it might be a maybe
It depend on the type of record that you gon' play me
I can't do a wack verse, industry would trade me
Every time you hear my name, you know I'm goin' crazy
Really, I'm a trench kid, SB really made me
Really had the same goal and dream since a baby, ooh-ooh-ooh

Wheezy outta here

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Yeah, rest in peace to Bankroll‚ show 'em how to do it
Baby goin' crazy‚ he been gettin' straight to it
I done caught so many flights I end up fuckin' all the stewardesses
Catch me in Atlanta‚ no security with my jewelry
Found I was rich, my baby mama talkin' suin' me
'Nother bitch tellin' lies on the pussy like she screwin' me
Catch him down bad, that's his ass‚ nigga, you or me
SI diamonds on the chain, he ain't foolin' me
We was skippin' school on the train‚ duckin' truancy
My main partner turned into a rat, he talkin' 'bout robbin' me
I pray the judge give that boy a bond so I can pop him
We was in the hood, sellin' bags, shootin' choppers
Fucked around and tried to go and lease a helicopter
Baby really a problem, somebody gotta stop him
And the haters watchin' too hard, I think they got binoculars
Every nigga with me on go, it ain't no stoppin' us
Niggas actin' like they got the bag, I'm tryna stop it up
Do this for the bros down the road, gotta lock it up
All you gotta do is say it's smoke, then we're poppin' up
Baby got the streets on hold, he ain't drop yet
I've been goin' hard, it's gon' be hard for you to top that
I make it look easy, but this shit really a process
I'm really a millionaire, still in the projects

Baby puttin' on for the city
Baby, he the realest, Baby prolly got a couple million
Baby hang with four or five killers

Baby keep it real with his people
Baby like a preacher, Baby prolly still sell reefer

Huh? Baby prolly still got them 'bows
I tell my bitch I'm faithful, but I still got the hoes
Baby gettin' jiggy, on stage with the Glizzy
Baby CEO, he shake the game like he Diddy
You would think it's Mardi Gras, I got these bitches showin' titties
And I ain't throwin' beads, I pull them bitches' weaves
I'm stallin' bitches out, if I'm a dog, then she a flea
And when I fuck her doggystyle the only time I'm on my knee
I barely wanna hit her, got her beggin', ""Baby, please""
I tell a bitch to shut up, you 'bout to fuck my nut up
The label's CEO keep beggin' me to keep the gun up
They know, you play with Baby, Baby beat him, cut up
Private plane, Wi-Fi, on the FaceTime with Johnny
I told him ice my wrist up, I like to hold my fist up
How that boy DaBaby in the air not gettin' his dick sucked?
Why he keep the fire and throw them fours in every picture?
'Cause nigga...

¡Da-ddy Yan-kee!
You beat me
You got me into your game and you hurt me
I might spend my money with you
I think I am a millionaire throwing money in the air
Because you are beautiful, I flirt
So let's discuss and I never come back, that's why (Rrr!)
I want to go home with you, but you don't let me (Oh, oh, oh)
That baby is a threat, I think you're my partner (Let's go!)
One drink (Hey), two drinks (Hey), the problem started
Because alcohol got into my system (Prr)
Who will say what happened here, will have problems with us
Don't blame me, blame her (Come on!)

But I know how delicious I spent it (Ah)
Midnight arrived (Night)
We were just beginning to touch each other (Touch)
Is that my boyfriend was waiting for me
Before twelve o'clock (Twelve)
How good we spent yesterday (Yesterday)
I know I failed and he must forgive me (Eh, eh)
And if I see him again tomorrow (Ah)
I will say that he don't know me

That booty that even a blind man can see
And even the holiest wants to be unfaithful (Leggo)

I only feel good with you
If having you is bad, I pay my sentence, baby

But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Man, it doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought me some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

And the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, and snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really grab me tight

Jack frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that santa's on his way -
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And ev'rymother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so i'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although its been said many times
Many ways: ""merry christmas to you""

Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays
Cause no matter how far away you roam
If you want to be happy in a million ways
For the holidays, you can't beat home, sweet home
(Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays)
(When you pine for the sunshine of a friendly gaze
I met a man who lives in Tennessee and he was headin' for
Pennsylvania and some homemade pumpkin pie
From Pennsylvania folks are trav'lin' down to Dixie's sunny shore
From Atlantic to Pacific, gee, the traffic is terrific
Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays
Cause no matter how far away you roam
If you want to be happy in a million ways
For the holidays, you can't beat home, sweet home
For the holidays, you can't beat home, sweet home",Perry Como,Perry Como,2020,[37],1
169,Blue Christmas,"[Verse 1]
I'll have a Blue Christmas without you
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
(Ahh, ahh)
Won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me
(Ooh)

[Verse 2]
And when those blue snowflakes start fallin'
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
That's when those blue memories start callin'
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
(Ahh, ahh)
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas

[Bridge]
(Oooooaaaooooh
Oooooaaaooooh)

[Outro]
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
(Ahh, ahh)
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)",Elvis Presley,Elvis Presley,2020,[40],1
170,White Christmas,"[Verse 1]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

[Verse 2]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
""May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white""

[Verse 1]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

[Verse 2]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
""May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white""",Bing Crosby,Bing Crosby,2020,[42],1
171,Jingle Bells,"[Chorus]
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

[Verse 1]
Dashing through the snow (Rudolph)
In a one-horse open sleigh (today)
O'er the fields we go (Rudolph)
Laughing all the way (today)
Bells on bob-tail ring
Making our spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

[Chorus]
Jingle bells, jingle, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

I love those JINGLE bells
Those holiday JINGLE bells
All those happy JINGLE BE double LES
I love those JINGLE bells

Jingle all the way

(Some other version:)
Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
Through the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bob-tail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Echo: Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, O
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
We ran into a drifted bank
And there we got upsot

A day or two ago
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed at me as
I there sprawling laid
But quickly drove away

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young
Take the girls along
And sing this sleighing song
Just bet a bob-tailed bay
Two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! You'll take the lead",Frank Sinatra,Frank Sinatra,2020,[43],1
172,Like It's Christmas,"[Intro]
Dum-dum-dum-dum

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
The snow on the ground, the love in the air
Sleigh bells are ringin'
This is what it's all about
The fire is warm, the angels are singin'

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas with Joe Jonas]
And I don't wanna miss a single thing
Don't wanna put end to all this cheer
But as long as you're with me
It's always the time of the year

[Chorus: Joe Jonas with Nick Jonas]
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas
Never wanna stop
Feelin' like the first thing on your wishlist
Right up at the top
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside
Nothin' fake about the way you bring me to life
You make every day feel like it's Christmas
Everyday that I'm with you

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas with Nick Jonas]
Look at the lights
Twinklin' bright 24/7
Every inch of Central Park is covered in white
This could be heaven

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas with Nick Jonas]
And I don't wanna miss a single thing
Don't wanna put end to all this cheer
But as long as you're with me
It's always the time of the year, yeah (woo!)

[Chorus: Joe Jonas with Nick Jonas, Nick Jonas]
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas (Like it's Christmas)
Never wanna stop
Feelin' like the first thing on your wishlist
Right up at the top
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside
Nothin' fake about the way you bring me to life
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas
Everyday that I'm with you

[Bridge: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Woo, woo, woo, yeah (Every day that I'm with you)
Every day, every night (Oh, oh, all day)

[Chorus: Joe Jonas with Nick Jonas]
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas
Never wanna stop
Feelin' like the first thing on your wishlist
Right up at the top (And I can't deny)
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside
Nothin' fake about the way you bring me to life
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas
Everyday that I'm with you

[Outro: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Hey, hey, yeah
Everyday, la-la-la
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside
No matter the reason, no matter decision
My heart will keep beatin', you better believe
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas (Like it's Christmas)
Everyday that I'm with you (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Everyday that I'm with you (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Everyday that I'm with you",Jonas Brothers,Jonas Brothers,2020,[44],1
173,Baby It's Cold Outside,"[Verse 1: Marilyn Maxwell & Dean Martin]
I really can't stay (But, baby, it's cold outside)
I've got to go away (But, baby, it's cold outside)
This evening has been (Been hoping that you'd drop in)
So very nice (I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice)
My mother will start to worry (Beautiful, what's your hurry?)
My father will be pacing the floor (Listen to the fireplace roar)
So, really, I'd better scurry (Beautiful, please don't hurry)
But maybe just a half a drink more (Put some records on while I pour)
The neighbors might think (Baby, it's bad out there)
Say, what's in this drink? (No cab's to be had out there)
I wish I knew how (Your eyes are like starlight now)
To break this spell (I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)
I ought to say, ""No, no, no, sir"" (Mind if I move in closer?)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (What's the sense of hurtin' my pride?)

[Chorus: Marilyn Maxwell, Dean Martin & Both]
I really can't stay
(Oh, baby, don't hold out)
Baby, it's cold outside

[Verse 2: Marilyn Maxwell & Dean Martin]
I simply must go (But, baby, it's cold outside)
The answer is no (But, baby, it's cold outside)
Your welcome has been (How lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (Look out the window at the storm)
My sister will be suspicious (Gosh your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (Waves upon the tropical shore)
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious (Gosh your lips are delicious)
But maybe just a cigarette more (Never such a blizzard before)
I've gotta get home (But, baby, you'd freeze out there)
Say, lend me a coat (It's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand (I thrill when you touch my hand)
But don't you see? (How can you do this thing to me?)
There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Think of my lifelong sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied (If you got pneumonia and died)

[Chorus: Marilyn Maxwell, Dean Martin & Both]
I really can't stay
(Get over that cold out)
Baby, it's cold
Baby, it's cold outside",Dean Martin,Dean Martin,2020,[45],1
174,"You're A Mean One, Mr. Grinch","[Verse 1]
You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
You really are a heel
You're as cuddly as a cactus
You're as charming as an eel, Mr. Grinch
You're a bad banana
With a greasy black peel

[Verse 2]
You're a monster, Mr. Grinch
Your heart's an empty hole
Your brain is full of spiders
You've got garlic in your soul, Mr. Grinch
I wouldn't touch you
With a thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole

[Verse 3]
You're a vile one, Mr. Grinch
You have termites in your smile
You have all the tender sweetness
Of a seasick crocodile, Mr. Grinch
Given the choice between the two of you
I'd take the seasick crocodile

[Verse 4]
You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch
You're a nasty, wasty skunk
Your heart is full of unwashed socks
Your soul is full of gunk, Mr. Grinch
The three words that best describe you
Are as follows, and I quote:
""Stink. Stank. Stunk.""

[Verse 5]
You're a rotter, Mr. Grinch
You're the king of sinful sots
Your heart's a dead tomato splotched
With moldy purple spots, Mr. Grinch
Your soul is an appalling dump heap
Overflowing with the most disgraceful assortment
Of deplorable rubbish imaginable
Mangled up in tangled-up knots

[Verse 6]
You nauseate me, Mr. Grinch
With a nauseous super-naus
You're a crooked, jerky jockey
And you drive a crooked hoss, Mr. Grinch
You're a three-decker sauerkraut and toadstool sandwich
With arsenic sauce",Thurl Ravenscroft,Thurl Ravenscroft,2020,[49],1

176,Hate Me,"[Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
Hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me

[Verse 1: Ellie Goulding]
I bet you don't kiss her with your eyes closed
I bet you're still walkin' on a tightrope
Miss me so much, you've been goin' psycho
You ain't gotta say it, baby, I know

[Pre-Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
It's a thin line between all this love and hate
And if you switch sides, you're gon' have to claim your place
So baby, this time you're gon' have to seal your fate
Yeah baby, this time you're gon' have to seal your fate

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
And tell me how you hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me
Hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me

[Drop: Ellie Goulding]
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me

[Verse 2: Juice WRLD]
Hate me, hate me, tell me how you hate me
Tell me how I'm trash and you could easily replace me
Tell me that I'm strung out, wasted on the daily
Prolly 'cause there's no one around me numbin' all my pain
Prolly 'cause there's no umbrella to shield me from all the rain
Probably because you're the one playin' the mind games
You hate me because I don't let you play no mind games
They give me migraines and damage my brain
Date me, break me, easily replace me
Hopefully, you see it clear, hopefully it's HD
Bet you wonder why the last few months I've been spacey
In your head, I sing...

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
And tell me how you hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me
Hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me
