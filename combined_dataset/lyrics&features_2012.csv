Not that old, 23
Got my life ahead of me
What's the point in having fun?
I'll do it when I'm 81
My favourite party's when nobody attends (You Know)
I'm in pants my watching a box set of Friends (For Sure)

Different song, same old shit
Long as it gets YouTube hits
MSN, after ten
You're really gonna do that joke again?
You thought that we'd be better, we been three years now together
Still got semen on my sweater from the one time we met Ke$ha
When I rap I slur, yes I got a lisp sir
Least I'm not rapping half pissed like Ke$ha

5,5,I Cry,"Hi, I’m the Rap Critic. And I’d like to talk about Flo Rida. Well, I mean, I’d like to, but I can’t seem to… I can’t, uh… I can’t care. I mean, this guy has literally no personality. Nothing to draw me into wanting to look up anything about him as a person or as an artist. Which is what makes his success so baffling. If you consider the fact that the guy has NO presence on hip-hop websites or pop music sites in general, he doesn’t hang out with any specific crowd of people like Young Money or Mayback music, and if the guy combined the record sales of his last three albums he STILL wouldn’t be going gold, it’s staggeringly confusing to know that he’s had five top 10 songs in the last three years

You know, I wouldn’t be surprised if he was some rapping android, created by Warner Music Group to make inoffensive generic party songs that elicit maximum positive responses from night club patrons. And it’s not just because he makes club music, it’s because…well, I’ll put it like this. Have you ever seen that episode of Futurama where this character named Slurms MacKenzie, as a mascot for this company is contractually obligated to party all the time despite how tired he gets? Yeah, Flo Rida is the hip-hop version of that. When I hear his party songs, I don’t hear a person having fun. Take Lil’ Jon, for example. No one would argue that his music was nothing more than ridy, rambunctious music for clubs. But you know what? When you heard him screaming and shouting all over the track, you understood what type of person he was. Loud, raucous, and probably a lot of fun to be around at a party. What I get from Flo Rida when he makes a club song is that…he has to make a song about being in the club. I mean, that’s it. Every song is, “I Must Say Something About Models, And Then I’ll Say I’m Popping Bottles…”

But then I heard the title of this new song by Flo Rida called “I Cry”. And it kinda took me back a little bit. I mean, with a title like that, it can’t be just about partying, right? You have to say something other than “party party party”, and “drink drink drink!” So, out of pure curiosity, let’s look at Flo Rida’s latest single, I Cry

I know, caught up in the middle
I cry just a little, when I think of letting go

Oh, hey! This song actually does sound like it’s gonna be about something! So this song is about him being sad and having to let something go. I wonder what he could possibly be talking about? What actual peak into Flo Rida’s psyche are we going to get with this unexpectedly more reflective, sad and somber-

(second half of the chorus comes in with a dubstep beat)
I know, caught up in the middle
I cry just a little, when I think of letting go

Wha… What are you doing? The song is called “I Cry”. Why is the beat so up-tempo and not unhappy? Are you really gonna do this? Are you really gonna rap about being sad and melancholy over a manic dubstep beat?! Dude, not every song you make has to be for the clubs! You can have a couple slower, thoughtful songs. Not everything has to be, “I’m partying hard, IN THE CLUB!” “I’m lookin’ at this girl’s fat booty IN THE CLUB!” “I’m sad and contemplating the darker moments of my life. IN THE CLUB!” Well, whatever. Maybe he really has something to say, but they’d only let him do it over another ripped EDM song. Well, let’s hear it

I know you wanna get behind the wheel, but (there’s) only one Rida

…Oh. So it’s gonna be one of THOSE songs, huh? You know, those songs where the chorus is about one thing, but the verse is about something completely different? *Young Jeezy’s My President and Fat Joe’s Lean Back* Fantastic

Can’t let go, I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to Japan, quake losers and survivors

Oh, wait, oh, okay! So this song is dedicated to those who died in the earthquake in Japan!

Can’t let go, I got fans in Okinawa

W-Wait a minute, did you just allude to the idea of you having fans anywhere, let alone in Japan? Yeah, okay. Look, maybe it’s different in other countries, but in America… You know what? I’m detracting from the intention of this song. I think I should actually let this go. I mean, it’s not often that you get a song that relates to current events, especially from someone like…

Norway, no you didn’t get my flowers

What?

Norway, no you didn’t get my flowers
No way to say it better but the killer was a coward

Oh, he’s talking about the guy who caused the terror attacks in Norway. But wait…

Norway, no you didn’t get my flowers

…Why would you specifically note that you didn’t bring them flowers? Like, you might as well have said “Hey, your family died horrifically by being thrown into an active volcano. And uh, I bought nothing to symbolize my sympathy.” I mean, you don’t really have to send them flowers or anything, but when you specifically state that you didn’t, you kinda come off like a jerk! Or maybe this song is about how Flo Rida is some self-aware robot that sees the tragedy in the world and wants to do something to change it. But since he’s been programmed to only make crappy club music, he must let go of his aspirations. Kinda sad when you think about it!

Get mad ‘cause (of) the quarter million on my necklace

Wait…never mind

DUI never said I was driving reckless

Uh, why did you just bring that up? How does that in any way relate to the line before it? What, do you think your expensive chain is the reason why cops arrested you for being drunk while driving? You didn’t get a DUI because you have a chain; you got it because alcohol inheritance slows down reaction time, you moron!

You and I know that jealousy is not impressive

Neither is forgetting the topic of your own song, which is… What’s this song about again?

Oh no, I can’t stop, I was destined

Destined for what? Destined to be rich and successful? Is this what you’re supposed to be crying about? Because you know the song is called “I Cry”, right?

Champagne buckets, still got two tears in it

Oh, no! You have a quarter million dollars worth of jewelry on your neck, but you cry two tears into your bucket of $800 champagne?! Are you falling on hard times, Flo Rida?! Look, I understand how money doesn’t buy happiness, and that you can be rich and still have problems, but let me explain to you how empathy works. If you want the general public to care about how you feel, and the emotion you’re trying to get across is sadness, it makes it a little harder for us to really get it if you keep mentioning how much money you have. Because most of us don’t have that much money! See, there are plenty of musicians who are richer than all of us, but we still feel their music because they don’t bring it up in their sad songs. You think Man in the Mirror would have had the same impact if in the middle of the verse, Michael Jackson just started talking about the electric bill of his neverland ranch, and the fact that his last album raked in more money in a week than we’ll ever see in our entire lives? No! Because that pulls you out of the emotion of the song!

Buy my momma chandeliers, I’m in tears dammit
30 years you’d have thought these emotions vanished
Tryna live, tryna figure how your sister vanished
No cheers, I know you wouldn’t panic

Wait, w-w-w-wait. So this song is about the disappearance of your sister. -Or aunt, since he said “your” sister in reference to his mom.- And your family having to deal with such a tragedy? Wow. I-I didn’t even know that that had happened. I don’t think anyone knew; I mean that’s truly sad to have a family member suddenly disappear without any knowledge of where they can be. Well I’m certainly glad you decided to wait UNTIL THE LAST FOUR LINES OF THE SONG TO TELL US THAT! Seriously, was this devastating info not important enough to tell us about a couple lines ago?! Do gold chains and boogady vehicles take precedence over your freaking missing sister?! Geez, dude, what’s wrong with you?!

When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down, I know it’s all better now

So, whenever you need to feel better, you just stare at the ceiling? I mean, I get looking at a sunset, a sunset’s beautiful. But first, you just look at the ceiling? He doesn’t even say he prays or anything, he just says, “I look at the ceiling, and I feel better now.”

Good god, this is some obvious pseudo-feel good crap right here. I give this a 2 out of 5. And yeah I know this episode is short, but you know what? This guy doesn’t deserve a full episode. And even so, what can you say about this, man? When what he’s rapping about isn’t unintelligible, he’s pretty much bragging about himself, with sprinkles of sadness thrown in every couple lines, and you know what? It was exactly what I was expecting. So let’s end this here so I can talk about a rapper that actually matters, like Kendrick Lamar, whose single probably still isn’t charting that well, if at all

Wait, what? Swimming Pools is actually in the top 40 right now, making the ending of my last episode completely irrelevant? Huh. Why is it that every time I’m optimistic about a good artist, they either disappear or become terrible? But when I’m either pessimistic about a good artist or I just want a bad artist to go away, they always stick around- Flo Rida, I hope your success is unending and that you stick around forever

8,8,Some Nights,"[Chorus 1]
Some nights, I stay up cashing in my bad luck
Some nights, I call it a draw
Some nights, I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights, I wish they'd just fall off
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
What do I stand for?
What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know anymore

[Verse 1]
This is it, boys, this is war
What are we waiting for?
Why don't we break the rules already?
I was never one to believe the hype
Save that for the black and white
Try twice as hard and I'm half as liked
But here they come again to jack my style

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And that's alright
(That's Alright)
I found a martyr in my bed tonight
She stops my bones from wondering
Just who I, who, I, who I am
Oh, who am I?

[Chorus 2]
Well, some nights, I wish that this all would end
'Cause I could use some friends for a change
And some nights, I'm scared you'll forget me again
Some nights, I always win (I always win)
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
What do I stand for?
What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know

[Bridge 1]
(Oh, come on) So this is it?
I sold my soul for this?
Washed my hands of that for this?
I miss my mom and dad for this?
(Oh, come on) No
When I see stars, when I see stars, that's all they are
When I hear songs, they sound like a swan
So, come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on

[Verse 2]
Well, that is it, guys, that is all
Five minutes in and I'm bored again
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands
This one is not for the folks back home
Sorry to leave, Mom, I had to go
Who the fuck wants to die alone
All dried up in the desert sun?

[Bridge 2]
My heart is breaking for my sister
And the con that she called ""love""
And then I look into my nephew's eyes
Man, you wouldn't believe the most amazing things
That can come from
Some terrible nights

[Outro]
The other night, you wouldn't believe
The dream I just had about you and me
I called you up, but we'd both agree
It's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance, oh
For the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance, oh","['some', 'nights', 'i', 'stay', 'up', 'cash', 'in', 'my', 'bad', 'luck', 'some', 'nights', 'i', 'call', 'it', 'a', 'draw', 'some', 'nights', 'i', 'wish', 'that', 'my', 'lips', 'could', 'build', 'a', 'castle', 'some', 'nights', 'i', 'wish', 'theyd', 'just', 'fall', 'off', 'but', 'i', 'still', 'wake', 'up', 'i', 'still', 'see', 'your', 'ghost', 'oh', 'lord', 'im', 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'i', 'stand', 'for', 'oh', 'what', 'do', 'i', 'stand', 'for', 'what', 'do', 'i', 'stand', 'for', 'most', 'nights', 'i', 'dont', 'know', 'anymore', 'this', 'be', 'it', 'boys', 'this', 'be', 'war', 'what', 'be', 'we', 'wait', 'for', 'why', 'dont', 'we', 'break', 'the', 'rule', 'already', 'i', 'be', 'never', 'one', 'to', 'believe', 'the', 'hype', 'save', 'that', 'for', 'the', 'black', 'and', 'white', 'try', 'twice', 'as', 'hard', 'and', 'im', 'half', 'as', 'like', 'but', 'here', 'they', 'come', 'again', 'to', 'jack', 'my', 'style', 'and', 'thats', 'alright', 'i', 'find', 'a', 'martyr', 'in', 'my', 'bed', 'tonight', 'she', 'stop', 'my', 'bone', 'from', 'wonder', 'just', 'who', 'i', 'who', 'i', 'who', 'i', 'be', 'oh', 'who', 'be', 'i', 'well', 'some', 'nights', 'i', 'wish', 'that', 'this', 'all', 'would', 'end', 'cause', 'i', 'could', 'use', 'some', 'friends', 'for', 'a', 'change', 'and', 'some', 'nights', 'im', 'scar', 'youll', 'forget', 'me', 'again', 'but', 'i', 'still', 'wake', 'up', 'i', 'still', 'see', 'your', 'ghost', 'oh', 'lord', 'im', 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'i', 'stand', 'for', 'oh', 'what', 'do', 'i', 'stand', 'for', 'what', 'do', 'i', 'stand', 'for', 'most', 'nights', 'i', 'dont', 'know', 'i', 'sell', 'my', 'soul', 'for', 'this', 'wash', 'my', 'hand', 'of', 'that', 'for', 'this', 'i', 'miss', 'my', 'mom', 'and', 'dad', 'for', 'this', 'when', 'i', 'see', 'star', 'when', 'i', 'see', 'star', 'thats', 'all', 'they', 'be', 'when', 'i', 'hear', 'songs', 'they', 'sound', 'like', 'a', 'swan', 'so', 'come', 'on', 'oh', 'come', 'on', 'oh', 'come', 'on', 'oh', 'come', 'on', 'well', 'that', 'be', 'it', 'guy', 'that', 'be', 'all', 'five', 'minutes', 'in', 'and', 'im', 'bore', 'again', 'ten', 'years', 'of', 'this', 'im', 'not', 'sure', 'if', 'anybody', 'understand', 'this', 'one', 'be', 'not', 'for', 'the', 'folks', 'back', 'home', 'sorry', 'to', 'leave', 'mom', 'i', 'have', 'to', 'go', 'who', 'the', 'fuck', 'want', 'to', 'die', 'alone', 'all', 'dry', 'up', 'in', 'the', 'desert', 'sun', 'my', 'heart', 'be', 'break', 'for', 'my', 'sister', 'and', 'the', 'con', 'that', 'she', 'call', 'love', 'and', 'then', 'i', 'look', 'into', 'my', 'nephews', 'eye', 'man', 'you', 'wouldnt', 'believe', 'the', 'most', 'amaze', 'things', 'that', 'can', 'come', 'from', 'some', 'terrible', 'nights', 'the', 'other', 'night', 'you', 'wouldnt', 'believe', 'the', 'dream', 'i', 'just', 'have', 'about', 'you', 'and', 'me', 'i', 'call', 'you', 'up', 'but', 'wed', 'both', 'agree', 'its', 'for', 'the', 'best', 'you', 'didnt', 'listen', 'its', 'for', 'the', 'best', 'we', 'get', 'our', 'distance', 'oh', 'for', 'the', 'best', 'you', 'didnt', 'listen', 'its', 'for', 'the', 'best', 'we', 'get', 'our', 'distance', 'oh']",419,​fun.,fun.,2012,"[9, 8, 6, 6, 5, 4, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 8, 11, 11, 14, 17, 28, 32, 32, 41, 47, 59, 64, 67, 76, 76, 74, 69, 68, 68, 68, 70, 76, 82, 89, 62]",43,Some Nights,https://open.spotify.com/track/6t6oULCRS6hnI7rm0h5gwl,6t6oULCRS6hnI7rm0h5gwl,spotify:track:6t6oULCRS6hnI7rm0h5gwl,Some Nights,7iycyHwOW2plljYIK6I1Zo,spotify:album:7iycyHwOW2plljYIK6I1Zo,fun.,5nCi3BB41mBaMH9gfr6Su0,spotify:artist:5nCi3BB41mBaMH9gfr6Su0,277.04,12.0,69.0,2012-02-21,0.672,0.738,0.0,-7.045,1.0,0.0506,0.0178,6.75e-05,0.0927,0.392,107.93799999999999,"['baroque pop', 'metropopolis', 'modern rock', 'pop', 'pop rock']",[],1.0

Happy in your aisles, in my shopping zone
Cause you get me, you get me, you get me, me, me, me

And can it be so bad, if it’s on the sale rack?
I’m spending, I’m spending, I’m spending, ing, ing, ing

And it’s long gone, money I will grieve
Time to realize Tar-chay is bad for me

Cause I knew you were trouble when I walked in
So shame on me now-ow
Curse you ever-present dollar bins
Cause you bring me down

Oh I knew you were trouble when I walked in
So shame on me now-ow
Knew the throw pil-lows would do me in
Oh my marriage, this will be a battleground

Oh, oh, Target always trouble
Oh, oh, Target, always trouble

No priorities. The stress, I want to cry
I’m blowing through my cash, and that’s the reason why
We’re drowning, we’re drowning, we’re drowning, ing, ing, ing

Need to move on, grow up and face the heat
Nothing new is worth feeling guil-ty
And now I see, now I see, now I see

I was all wrong, now I have the key
And I realize, that I could free, yeah!

With a budget, stroll past the dollar bins
No shame for me now
I knew what I’d spend before I pulled in
I’m a whole new girl, oh

Now I budget, Tar-get’s not a sin
No shame for me now
I grow me up, like I’ve never been
Now I’m saving extra money all around

Oh, oh, no more money trouble
Oh, oh, no more money trouble

And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That we’d never know free, or how, to save, or anything, yeah

Now I budget, Tar-get’s not a sin
No shame for me now
I knew I could spend before I pulled in
I’m a whole new girl, now

I know with a budget, Tar-get’s not a sin (your loss, Target, your loss, Target)
No shame for me now
Grew up, have cash, it’s a win-win
Now I’m saving extra money all around

Oh, oh, no more money trouble
Oh oh, no more more money trouble
Knew what I could spend before I pulled in

10,10,Let Me Love You (Until You Learn To Love Yourself),"[Verse 1]
Much as you blame yourself, you can't be blamed for the way that you feel
Had no example of a love that was even remotely real
How can you understand something that you never had?
Ooh, baby, if you let me, I can help you out with all of that

[Chorus]
Girl let me love you
And I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl let me love you
And all your trouble
Don't be afraid, girl let me help
Girl let me love you
And I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl let me love you
A heart of numbness gets brought to life
I'll take you there
Girl let me love you
Girl let me love you, baby, oh
Girl let me love you
Girl let me love you, baby
Girl let me love you
Let me love you, let me love you, oh

[Verse 2]
I can see the pain behind your eyes
It's been there for quite a while
I just wanna be the one to remind you what it is to smile
I would like to show you what true love can really do

[Chorus]
Girl let me love you
And I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl let me love you
And all your trouble
Don't be afraid, girl let me help
Girl let me love you
And I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl let me love you
A heart of numbness, gets brought to life
I'll take you there
Girl let me love you, baby
Girl let me love you
Let me love you, let me love you, baby
Girl let me love you
Girl let me love you, baby
Girl let me love you
Let me love you, girl let me love you, baby

[Bridge]
For every heart that beats
For every heart that beats
For every heart that beats
For every heart that beats
Heart that beats
Heart that beats
Heart that beats
Heart that beats

[Chorus]
Girl let me love you
And I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl let me love you
And all your trouble
Don't be afraid, girl let me help
Girl let me love you
And I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl let me love you
A heart of numbness, gets brought to life
I'll take you there

""Hey, Macklemore, can we go thrift shopping?""
What what, what, what
What what, what, what
What what, what, what
What what, what, what
What what, what, what
Bada, bada, bada doo da
What what, what, what
Bada, bada, bada doo da

Bada, bada, bada doo da
Bada, bada, bada doo da
Bada, bada, bada doo da
Bada, bada, bada doo da
Bada, bada, bada doo da

[Chorus: Wanz]
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got 20 dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Now
Walk into the club like, ""What up? I got a big cock""
Nah, I'm just pumped, I bought some shit from a thrift shop
Ice on the fringe is so damn frosty
The people like, ""Damn, that's a cold ass honkey""
Rollin' in hella deep, headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink 'cept my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standin' next to me
Probably should've washed this, smells like R. Kelly sheets
Piss...
But shit, it was 99 cents!
Fuck it, coppin' it, washin' it, 'bout to go and get some compliments
Passin' up on those moccasins someone else has been walkin' in
Bummy and grungy, fuck it man, I am stunting and flossin'
And saving my money and I'm hella happy; that’s a bargain, bitch
I'ma take your grandpa's style, I'ma take your grandpa's style
No, for real, ask your grandpa, can I have his hand-me-downs? (Thank you!)
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie brown leather jacket that I found diggin'
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a knee board
Hello, hello, my ace man, my mellow
John Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no
I could take some Pro Wings, make 'em cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like, ""Ah, he got the Velcros""

[Chorus: Wanz]
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got 20 dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got 20 dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
What you know about rockin' a wolf on your noggin?
What you knowin' about wearin' a fur fox skin?
I'm diggin', I'm diggin'
I'm searchin' right through that luggage
One man's trash, that's another man's come up
Thank your granddad for donatin' that plaid button-
up shirt 'cause right now, I'm up in hurr stuntin'
I'm at the Goodwill, you can find me in the bins
I'm not, I'm not stuck on searchin' in that section (Mens)
Your grammy, your auntie, your mama, your mammy
I'll take those flannel zebra jammies
Second hand and I'll rock that, motherfucker
The built-in onesie with the socks on the motherfucker
I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker
They be like, ""Oh, that Gucci? That's hella tight""
I'm like, ""Yo, that's 50 dollars for a T-shirt""
Limited edition, let's do some simple addition
50 dollars for a T-shirt, that's just some ignorant bitch shit
I call that getting-swindled-and-pimped shit
I call that getting tricked by business
That shirt's hella dough
And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't
Peep game, come take a look through my telescope
Tryna get girls from a brand?
Man, you hella won't! Man, you hella won't!

[Interlude]
Goodwill, poppin' tags, yeah!

[Chorus: Wanz]
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got 20 dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome

[Bridge: Wanz]
I'll wear your granddad's clothes
I look incredible
I'm in this big-ass coat
From that thrift shop down the road
I'll wear your granddad's clothes (Damn right)
I look incredible (Now come on, man)
I’m in this big-ass coat (Big-ass coat)
From that thrift shop down the road (Let's go, come on!)

[Chorus: Wanz]
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got 20 dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up

13,13,Try,"[Intro]
Ever wonder about what he's doing
How it all turned to lies?
Sometimes I think﻿ that it's better to never ask why

[Chorus]
Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns
Doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try
You gotta get up and try try try

[Break]
Eh, eh, eh

[Verse 1]
Funny how the heart can be deceiving
More than just a couple times
Why do we fall in love so easy
Even when it's not right

[Chorus]
Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns
Doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try
You gotta get up and try try try

[Verse 2]
Ever worried that it might be ruined
And does it make you wanna cry?
When you're out there doing what you're doing
Are you just getting by?
Tell me are you just getting by by by

[Chorus]
Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns
Doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try
You gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try
You gotta get up and try try try
Gotta get up and try try try

15,15,Girl On Fire,"[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Spirit of Marilyn callin' me, audibly
Bawling, she said that she would never leave, continued to torture me
Telling me to come with her, underneath my comforter
And she brought a gun with her, pills and some rum with her
Took me on the balcony, telling me to jump with her
Yeah I'm in the ghost, but I ain't doing stunts with her
I ain't trying to be that, haters wanna see that
But I got 'em aggy, 'cause I win the gold like Gabby

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
She's just a girl, and she's on fire
Hotter than a fantasy, lonely like a highway
She's living in a world, and it's on fire
Feeling the catastrophe, but she knows she can fly away

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Oh, she got both feet on the ground
And she's burning it down
Oh, she got her head in the clouds
And she's not backing down

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire

[Verse 3: Alicia Keys]
Looks like a girl, but she's a flame
So bright, she can burn your eyes
Better look the other way
You can try, but you'll never forget her name
She's on top of the world
Hottest of the hottest girls say

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Oh, we got our feet on the ground
And we're burning it down
Oh, got our head in the clouds
And we're not coming down

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
This girl is on fire (fire, fire)
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire (fire, fire)
This girl is on fire

[Bridge: Alicia Keys]
Everybody stands, as she goes by
'Cause they can see the flame that's in her eyes
Watch her when she's lighting up the night
Nobody knows that she's a lonely girl
And it's a lonely world
But she gon' let it burn, baby, burn, baby

[Verse 5: Nicki Minaj]
Dear God, If you're here God
Make the fire disappear when they stare God
Take away my fear when they interfere God
Do you fear God? 'Cause I fear God
And in my backyard, that's a deer, God
And that's a horse ranch, and to my core fans
Keep reppin' me, do it 'til the death of me
'X' in the box, 'cause ain't nobody checkin' me

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
This girl is on fire (Fire, fire)
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire (Fire, fire)
This girl is on fire

16,16,The A Team,"[Verse 1]
White lips, pale face
Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, days end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

[Chorus]
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

[Verse 2]
Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

[Chorus]
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly

[Bridge]
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyes and hopin' for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

[Alternate Chorus]
And we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Fly, fly

So this is what you meant
When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

[Chorus]
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

[Verse 2]
So this is where you fell
And I am left to sail
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turn in the rags and giving the commodities a rain check

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes, to ashes

[Verse 1]
Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes
Lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me

[Chorus]
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it

Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me
Then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now
And I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down
I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted
As soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently, I'm over-influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me

I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it

[Refrain]
Pour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)

[Bridge]
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang

[Chorus]
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it

[Interlude: Sherane]
(Pool full of Kendrick's lies in it)
Aw man… where is she takin' me?
Where is she takin' me?
(Pool full of liquor ima die in it)

[Verse 3]
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do, then you're like me
Makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release
Everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh?
Don't you feel bad? I probably sleep
And never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough

[Outro]
They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
K-Dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off
That nigga's straight, man, that nigga ain't trippin'
We gon' do the same ol' shit
I'ma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways
Fall right in ****'s lap
And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that
And I hope that bitch that set him up out there
We gon' pop that bitch too
Wait hold up, ayy, I see somebody
[Car door opens and gunshots are fired]
Aha! Got them niggas, K-Dot, you good?
L****, you good?
Yeah, blood, I'm good – Dave, you good?
Dave? Dave, say somethin' – Dave?

[Intro: James Fauntleroy & Big Sean]
What of the dollar you murdered for?
Is that the one fighting for your soul?
Or your brother's the one that you're running from?
But if you got money, fuck it, ‘cause I want some
B-I-G, who fuckin' with me?
Oh, God! Whoa, okay

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Ain't nobody fuckin' with my clique
Clique, clique, clique, clique
Ain't nobody fresher than my muh'fuckin' clique
Clique, clique, clique, clique
As I look around, they don't do it like my clique
Clique, clique, clique, clique
And all these bad bitches, man
They want the-, they want the-, they want the-

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
(B-I-G, oh, God! Go)
I tell a bad bitch do whatever I say
My block behind me, like I'm coming out the driveway
It's grind day, from Friday to next Friday
I been up straight for nine days, I need a spa day (spa day)
Yup, she tryin' to get me that poon-tang
I might let my crew bang, my crew deeper than Wu-Tang
I'm rollin' with... fuck I'm saying? Girl, you know my crew name
You know 2 Chainz? Scrrr!
I'm pullin' up in that Bruce Wayne
But I'm the fuckin' villain
Man, they kneelin' when I'm walking in the buildin'
Freaky women I be feelin' from the bank accounts I'm fillin'
What a feelin'! Ah man, they gotta be
Young player from the D
That's killing everything that he see for the dough

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Ain't nobody fuckin' with my clique
Clique, clique, clique, clique
Ain't nobody fresher than my muh'fuckin' clique
Clique, clique, clique, clique
As I look around, they don't do it like my clique
Clique, clique, clique, clique
And all these bad bitches, man
They want the, they want the, they want the

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
(Click clack, stick 'em up!)
Yeah, I'm talkin' Ye, yeah, I'm talkin' Rih
Yeah, I'm talkin' B, nigga, I'm talkin' me
Yeah, I'm talkin' bossy, I ain't talkin' Kelis
Your money too short, you can't be talking to me
Yeah, I'm talkin' LeBron, we ball in our family tree
G.O.O.D. Music drug-dealing cousin
Ain't nothin' fuckin' with we, me
Turn that 62 to 125, 125 to a 250
250 to a half a million, ain't nothin' nobody can do with me
Now, who with me? ¡Vámonos! Call me Hov or Jefe
Translation: I'm the shit, 'least that what my neck say
'Least that what my check say, lost my homie for a decade
Nigga down for like 12 years
Ain't hug his son since the second grade
Uh, he never told—who he gonna tell?
We top of the totem pole
It's the Dream Team meets the Supreme Team
And all our eyes green, it only means one thing
You ain't fuckin' with the clique

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Ain't nobody fuckin' with my clique
Clique, clique, clique, clique
Ain't nobody fresher than my muh'fuckin' clique
Clique, clique, clique, clique
As I look around, they don't do it like my clique
Clique, clique, clique, clique
And all these bad bitches, man
They want the, they want the, they want the

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Break records at Louis, ate breakfast at Gucci
My girl a superstar all from a home movie
Bow on our arrival, the un-American idols
What niggas did in Paris, got 'em hangin' off the Eiffel
Yeah, I'm talkin' business, we talkin' CIA
I'm talkin' George Tenet, I seen him the other day
He asked me about my Maybach, think he had the same
Except mine tinted and his might have been rented
You know, white people get money, don't spend it
Or maybe they get money, buy a business
I rather buy 80 gold chains and go ign'ant
I know Spike Lee gon' kill me, but let me finish
Blame it on the pigment, we livin' no limits
Them gold Master P ceilings was just a figment
Of our imagination, MTV cribs
Now I'm lookin' at a crib right next to where TC lives
That's Tom Cruise, whatever she accuse
He wasn't really drunk, he just had a frew brews
Pass the refreshments, a cool, cool beverage
Everything I do need a news crew's presence
Speedboat swerve, homie, watch out for the waves
I'm way too black to burn from sunrays
So I just meditate at the home in Pompeii
About how I could build a new Rome in one day
Every time I'm in Vegas they screamin' like he's Elvis
But I just wanna design hotels and nail it
Shit is real, got me feelin' Israelian
Like Bar Refaeli, or Gisele—no, that's Brazilian
Went through, deep depression when my mama passed
Suicide, what kinda talk is that?
But I been talkin' to God for so long
That if you look at my life I guess he's talkin' back
Fuckin' with my clique

[Outro: Big Sean]
Ain't nobody fresher than my muh'fuckin' clique
As I look around, they don't do it like my clique

At the end of it all, you're still my best friend

Which way is wrong?
How do I say that I need to move on?
You know we're heading separate ways

26,26,We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,"[Verse 1]
I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough,"" 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed ""space"" (what?)
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
Like, ever

[Verse 2]
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me, falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you, would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, ever, ever (ever) getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah)

I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say, ""Never say never""
Ugh, so he calls me up and he's like, ""I still love you""
And I'm like, ""I just- I mean, this is exhausting, you know?
Like, we are never getting back together, like, ever""

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever (ooh) getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me

We both know, it's a cruel world (Cruel world)
But I will (But I will) take my chances

I stand back and point at you, you, you

30,30,Little Talks,"[Refrain: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir, Ragnar Þórhallsson]
Hey! Hey! Hey!

[Verse 1: Nanna, Ragnar & Both]
I don't like walking around this old and empty house
So hold my hand, I'll walk with you my dear
The stairs creak as you sleep; it's keeping me awake
It's the house telling you to close your eyes
Some days I can't even dress myself
It's killing me to see you this way
'Cause though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our
Bodies safe to shore

[Refrain: Nanna, Ragnar]
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

[Verse 2: Nanna, Ragnar & Both]
There's an old voice in my head that's holding me back
Well, tell her that I miss our little talks
Soon it will be over and buried with our past
We used to play outside when we were young, and full of life and full of love
Some days, I don't know if I am wrong or right
Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear
'Cause though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our
Bodies safe to shore

[Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar]
Hey! Don't listen to a word I say
Hey! The screams all sound the same
Hey! Though the truth may vary, this ship will carry our
Bodies safe to shore

[Refrain: Nanna, Ragnar]
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

[Bridge: Nanna, Ragnar]
You're gone, gone, gone away; I watched you disappear
All that's left is a ghost of you
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart; there's nothing we can do
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon
Now wait, wait, wait for me; please hang around
I'll see you when I fall asleep

32,32,Sweet Nothing,"[Verse 1: Florence Welch]
You took my heart, and you held it in your mouth
And with a word all my love came rushing out
And every whisper, it's the worst
Emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now

[Chorus: Florence Welch]
So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm trying to hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing

[Verse 2: Florence Welch]
It isn't easy for me to let it go
'Cause I've swallowed every single word
And every whisper, every sigh
Eats away at this heart of mine
And there is a hollow in me now

[Chorus: Florence Welch]
So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm trying to hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing

[Bridge: Florence Welch]
And it's not enough to tell me that you care
When we both know the words are empty air
You give me nothing
Nothing

Well I came home
Like a stone
And I fell heavy into your arms
These days of dust
Which we've known
Will blow away with this new sun

Wait for now
And I'll kneel down
Know my ground

And I will wait, I will wait for you

And relent
Well you forgave and I won't forget
Know what we've seen
And him with less
Now in some way
Shake the excess

And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you

So I'll be bold
As well as strong
And use my head alongside my heart
So tame my flesh
And fix my eyes
A tethered mind, freed from the lies

But I'll kneel down
Wait for now
I'll kneel down
Know my ground
Raise my hands
Paint my spirit gold
And bow my head
Keep my heart slow

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh, pop that pussy for a real nigga
Pull out my black card, that's my lil' nigga
Make a movie with your bitch, Steven Spiel nigga
Smokin' on Keysh, Cole, gimme me chills nigga
What's your real name? And not your stripper name
I make it rain on ya, like a windowpane
Bandz a make her dance, Tunechi make her cum
Hit-it-from-the-side-like-a-mothafuckin'-bass-drum
Two hoes on one fuckin' pole, two hoes on my fuckin' pole
I don't tip, I pay bills, bitches call me Buffalo
Her stomach in and her ass out
I'm flyer than the ones they pass out
If money grow on trees, I branched out
I'm just waitin' for my bitch to cash out (Ha ha)

[Chorus: Juicy J & Lil Wayne]
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
All these chicks poppin' pussy, I'm just poppin' bandz
I'm just waitin' for my bitch to cash out
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
Tunechi
These chicks clappin' and they ain't usin' hands
(Young Mula Baby)
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
All these chicks poppin' pussy, I'm just poppin' bandz
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
These chicks clappin' and they ain't usin' hands

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz!
2 Chainz, four bracelets
Let me see that ass clap; standin' ovation
If yo girl don't swallow kids, man, that ho basic
Got 2 bitches with me: take a shot of one ho, usin' her friend for a chaser
Bandz a make her bust it, let me see you touch it
Money talk, you ain't got none, end of discussion
Bandz a make her do it, pocket full of money
Young nigga gettin' head while the engine runnin'
Let me see you wiggle, do it for a real nigga
I be laughin' to the bank, all you do is giggle
Ballin' in my coupe, call it sports car
Drop the top and freak it, treat that bitch just like a porn star

35,35,Thinkin Bout You,"[Verse 1]
A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain in
Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but boy, they pour when

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, ooh no, no, no
I've been thinkin' bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' bout you, do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

[Chorus]
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

[Verse 2]
No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though, I'm lying down

[Pre-Chorus]
Thinkin' 'bout you, ooh no, no, no
I've been thinkin' bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' bout you, do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

[Chorus]
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

[Bridge]
Yes, of course, I remember, how could I forget (How could I forget?) how you feel? (How you feel)
You know you were my first time, a new feel
It won't ever get old, not in my soul, not in my spirit, keep it alive
We'll go down this road 'til it turns from color to black and white

[Chorus]
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?

I don't know how you do what you do

39,39,Stupid Boy,"She was precious like a flower
She grew wild, wild but innocent
A perfect prayer in a desperate hour
She was everything beautiful, and different

Stupid boy, you can't fence that in
Stupid boy, it's like holding back the wind
She laid her heart and soul right in your hands
And you stole her every dream and you crushed her plans
She never even knew she had a choice and that's what happens
When the only voice she hears is telling her she can't
Stupid boy

So what made you think you could take a life
And just push it, push it around
I guess to build yourself up so high
You had to take her and break her down

She laid her heart and soul right in your hands
And you stole her every dream and you crushed her plans
She never even knew she had a choice and that's what happens
When the only voice she hears is telling her she can't
You stupid boy

Oh, you always had to be right
But now you've lost the only thing that ever made you feel alive

You stole her every dream and you crushed her plans
She never even knew she had a choice and that's what happens
When the only voice she hears, is telling her she can't

You stupid boy, oh
Is the same old same old stupid boy

It took a while for her to figure out she could run

40,40,Better Dig Two,"[Verse 1]
I told you on the day we wed
I was gonna love you 'til I's dead
Made you wait 'til our wedding night
That's the first and the last time I wear white

[Verse 2]
So if the ties that bind ever do come loose
Tie them in a knot like a hangman's noose
'Cause I'll go to heaven or I'll go to hell
Before I'll see you with someone else

[Pre-Chorus]
Put me in the ground
Put me six foot down
And let the stone say:

[Chorus]
Here lies the girl whose only crutch
Was loving one man just a little too much
If you go before I do
I'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two

[Verse 3]
Well
It won't be whiskey, it won't be meth
It'll be your name on my last breath
If divorce or death ever do us part
The coroner will call it a broken heart

[Pre-Chorus]
So put me in the ground
Put me six foot down
And let the stone say:

[Chorus]
Here lies the girl whose only crutch
Was loving one man just a little too much
If you go before I do
I'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two
Dig two

[Bridge]
I took your name when I took those vows
I meant 'em back then and I mean 'em right now
Oh, right now

[Verse 4]
If the ties that bind ever do come loose
If forever ever ends for you
If that ring gets a little too tight
You might as well read me my last rites

[Pre-Chorus]
And let the stone say:

[Chorus]
Here lies the girl whose only crutch
Was loving one man just a little too much
If you go before I do
Gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig, uh!
There'll be a stone right next to mine
We'll be together 'til the end of time
Don't you go before I do
I'm gonna tell the gravedigger that he better dig two

I'm different, yeah I'm different
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing

[Verse 1]
Pull up to the scene but my roof gone
When I leave the scene, bet your boo gone
And I beat the pussy like a new song
2 Chainz but I got me a few on
Everything hot, skip lukewarm
Tell shawty bust it open, Uncle Luke on
Got the present for the present and a gift wrapping
I don't feel good but my trigger happy
Bet the stripper happy, bet they wish they had me
And I wish a nigga would like a kitchen cabinet
And me and you are cut from a different fabric
I fucked her so good, it's a bad habit
Bitch sit down, you got a bad atti'
Gave her the wrong number and a bad addy
You ain't going nowhere like a bad navi
Ass so big, I told her to look back at it (whoa)
Look back at it (whoa) look back at it (whoa)
Then I put a fat rabbit on the Craftmatic
I am so high, attic
I am so high like an, addict

I'm different, yeah I'm different
I'm different, yeah I'm different
I'm different, yeah I'm different

2 Chainz got your girl on the celly
And when I get off the celly, I made her meet at the telly
When she meet at the telly, I put it straight in her belly
When it go in the belly, it ain't shit you can tell me
Hair long, money long
Me and broke niggas, we don't get along
Hair long, money long
Me and broke niggas, we don't get along
I paid a thousand dollars for my sneakers
Ye told ya, a 100K for a feature

Beat it up, beat it up, then I get some head
Well I might get some head then I beat it up
I don't give a fuck, switch it up, nigga live it up
Yeah it's going down, so get up
Might valet park a Brinks truck

Touch my own skin and hope that I'm still breathing
And I think back to when my brother and my sister slept
In an unlocked place the only time I feel safe

43,43,Blow Me (One Last Kiss),"[Verse 1]
White knuckles
And sweaty palms from hanging on too tight
Clenched shut jaw
I've got another headache again tonight
Eyes on fire, eyes on fire
And they burn from all the tears
I've been crying, I've been crying
I've been dying over you
Tie a knot in the rope
Tryna hold, tryna to hold
But there's nothing to grasp so
I let go

[Chorus]
I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
Have you had a shit day?
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

[Verse 2]
I won't miss
All of the fighting that we always did
Take it in
I mean what I say when I say there is nothing left
No more sick
Whiskey dick
No more battles for me
You'll be calling a trick
Cause you no longer sleep
I'll dress nice
I'll look good
I'll go dancing alone
I will laugh
I'll get drunk
I'll take somebody home

[Chorus]
I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
Have you had a shit day?
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

[Interlude]
Blow me one last kiss
Blow me one last kiss

[Bridge]
I will do what I please
Anything that I want
I will breathe
I will breathe
I won't worry at all
You will pay for your sins
You'll be sorry, my dear
All the lies, all the ""why's"" will be crystal clear

[Chorus]
I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
Have you had a shit day?

I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
And now you're in my way
I trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my way

[Pre-Chorus]
Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?

[Chorus]
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

[Verse 2]
You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
But still you're in my way
I beg and borrow and steal
At first sight and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it
But it's in my way

Ripped jeans, skin was showing
Hot night, wind was blowing

45,45,Little Things,"[Verse 1: Zayn & Liam & Both]
Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me
But bear this in mind it was meant to be
And I'm joining up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks
And it all makes sense to me
I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes
When you smile, you've never loved your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine
But I’ll love them endlessly

[Chorus: Zayn and Liam]
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if I do, it's you, oh it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things

[Verse 2: Louis & Harry & Harry and Louis & Harry and Niall]
You can't go to bed without a cup of tea
Maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep
Though it makes no sense to me
I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much you weigh
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me

[Chorus: Harry and Niall & Harry]
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true, it's you, it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things

[Bridge: Niall]
You never love yourself half as much as I love you
You'll never treat yourself right darling but I want you to
If I let you know, I'm here for you
Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you, oh

[Chorus: Harry & All]
And I've just let these little things slip out of my mouth
'Cause it's you, oh it's you, it's you they add up to
And I'm in love with you and all these little things
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true, it's you, it's you they add up to
I'm in love with you, and all your little things","['your', 'hand', 'fit', 'in', 'mine', 'like', 'its', 'make', 'just', 'for', 'me', 'but', 'bear', 'this', 'in', 'mind', 'it', 'be', 'mean', 'to', 'be', 'and', 'im', 'join', 'up', 'the', 'dot', 'with', 'the', 'freckle', 'on', 'your', 'cheek', 'and', 'it', 'all', 'make', 'sense', 'to', 'me', 'i', 'know', 'youve', 'never', 'love', 'the', 'crinkle', 'by', 'your', 'eye', 'when', 'you', 'smile', 'youve', 'never', 'love', 'your', 'stomach', 'or', 'your', 'thighs', 'the', 'dimple', 'in', 'your', 'back', 'at', 'the', 'bottom', 'of', 'your', 'spine', 'but', 'i’ll', 'love', 'them', 'endlessly', 'i', 'wont', 'let', 'these', 'little', 'things', 'slip', 'out', 'of', 'my', 'mouth', 'but', 'if', 'i', 'do', 'its', 'you', 'oh', 'its', 'you', 'they', 'add', 'up', 'to', 'im', 'in', 'love', 'with', 'you', 'and', 'all', 'these', 'little', 'things', 'you', 'cant', 'go', 'to', 'bed', 'without', 'a', 'cup', 'of', 'tea', 'maybe', 'thats', 'the', 'reason', 'that', 'you', 'talk', 'in', 'your', 'sleep', 'and', 'all', 'those', 'conversations', 'be', 'the', 'secrets', 'that', 'i', 'keep', 'though', 'it', 'make', 'no', 'sense', 'to', 'me', 'i', 'know', 'youve', 'never', 'love', 'the', 'sound', 'of', 'your', 'voice', 'on', 'tape', 'you', 'never', 'want', 'to', 'know', 'how', 'much', 'you', 'weigh', 'you', 'still', 'have', 'to', 'squeeze', 'into', 'your', 'jeans', 'but', 'youre', 'perfect', 'to', 'me', 'i', 'wont', 'let', 'these', 'little', 'things', 'slip', 'out', 'of', 'my', 'mouth', 'but', 'if', 'its', 'true', 'its', 'you', 'its', 'you', 'they', 'add', 'up', 'to', 'im', 'in', 'love', 'with', 'you', 'and', 'all', 'these', 'little', 'things', 'you', 'never', 'love', 'yourself', 'half', 'as', 'much', 'as', 'i', 'love', 'you', 'youll', 'never', 'treat', 'yourself', 'right', 'darling', 'but', 'i', 'want', 'you', 'to', 'if', 'i', 'let', 'you', 'know', 'im', 'here', 'for', 'you', 'maybe', 'youll', 'love', 'yourself', 'like', 'i', 'love', 'you', 'oh', 'and', 'ive', 'just', 'let', 'these', 'little', 'things', 'slip', 'out', 'of', 'my', 'mouth', 'cause', 'its', 'you', 'oh', 'its', 'you', 'its', 'you', 'they', 'add', 'up', 'to', 'and', 'im', 'in', 'love', 'with', 'you', 'and', 'all', 'these', 'little', 'things', 'i', 'wont', 'let', 'these', 'little', 'things', 'slip', 'out', 'of', 'my', 'mouth', 'but', 'if', 'its', 'true', 'its', 'you', 'its', 'you', 'they', 'add', 'up', 'to', 'im', 'in', 'love', 'with', 'you', 'and', 'all', 'your', 'little', 'things']",323,One Direction,One Direction,2012,"[46, 53, 67, 65, 41]",5,Little Things,https://open.spotify.com/track/7kSLdGdXLey7pzLsWpdg1h,7kSLdGdXLey7pzLsWpdg1h,spotify:track:7kSLdGdXLey7pzLsWpdg1h,Take Me Home: Yearbook Edition,5SxEsi1PNyo1XfEKDYcFKF,spotify:album:5SxEsi1PNyo1XfEKDYcFKF,One Direction,4AK6F7OLvEQ5QYCBNiQWHq,spotify:artist:4AK6F7OLvEQ5QYCBNiQWHq,219.64,17.0,75.0,2012-11-09,0.7070000000000001,0.222,7.0,-11.716,1.0,0.0329,0.7879999999999999,0.0,0.205,0.556,110.095,"['boy band', 'dance pop', 'pop', 'post-teen pop', 'talent show']",[],1.0
46,46,Anything Could Happen,"[Verse 1]
Stripped to the waist we fall into the river
Cover your eyes so you don't know the secret
I've been trying to hide
We held our breath to see our names are written
On the wreck of '86
That was the year I knew the panic was over

Yes, since we found out
Since we found out

That anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen

Anything could happen
Anything could happen

After the war, we said we'd fight together
I guess we thought that's just what humans do
Letting darkness grow
As if we need its palette and we need its color

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But now I've seen it through
And now I know the truth

[Hook]
That anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could

Baby, I'll give you everything you need
I'll give you everything you need, oh
I'll give you everything you need
But I don't think I need you

48,48,Catch My Breath,"[Verse 1]
I don't wanna be left behind
Distance was a friend of mine
Catching breath in a web of lies
I've spent most of my life
Riding waves, playing acrobat
Shadowboxing the other half
Learning how to react
I've spent most of my time

[Pre-Chorus]
Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right

[Chorus]
Catch my breath
No one can hold me back, I ain't got time for that
Catch my breath
Won't let 'em get me down, it's all so simple now

[Verse 2]
Addicted to the love I found
Heavy heart, now a weightless cloud
Making time for the ones that count
I'll spend the rest of my time
Laughing hard with the windows down
Leaving footprints all over town
Keeping faith, karma comes around
I will spend the rest of my life

[Pre-Chorus]
Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right

[Chorus]
Catch my breath
No one can hold me back, I ain't got time for that
Catch my breath
Won't let 'em get me down, it's all so simple now

You helped me see
The beauty in everything

[Pre-Chorus]
Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right
Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right

49,49,Goodbye In Her Eyes,"[Verse 1]
I could tell that it was over
When her lips met mine
There was an emptiness in her voice
Hesitation when she smiled
She didn't have to say a word
It was just so plain to see
She'd found what she'd been looking for
And I knew it wasn't me

[Chorus 1]
I saw goodbye in her eyes
I don't think I can change it
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I feel like a clown
Can't wash off his makeup
The life she wanted, it was gone
Prince Charming I wasn't
But I would trade a thousand Babylons
To be in her arms tomorrow
Oh, but like the tide, her love has come and gone
And it's time for me to go

[Chorus 2]
I saw goodbye in her eyes
I don't think I can change it
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it (now she sees right through me)
Should I hold on to what we have got?
Is it just a waste of time?
One thing that I know for sure
I saw goodbye in her eyes
I saw goodbye in her eyes

[Bridge]
I know you got somebody new now
All my candles have burned out
He is going to love the way you shine (so did I)
So did I
So don't smile at me if it ain't what you mean
(Goodbye)

[Chorus 3]
With that goodbye in your eyes
I know that I can't change it (now you see right through me)
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it
I saw goodbye in your eyes
I know that I can't change it (now you see right through me goodbye in your eyes)
Should I hold on?
We will never make it (now you see right through me goodbye in your eyes)
Should I hold on?
Is it just a waste of time?
One thing that I know for sure
I saw goodbye in your eyes

50,50,Beer Money,"[Verse 1]
When the lights go down
And you're stuck here in this town
With nowhere to go
So you escape through the radio

And you worked all week
To barely make ends meet
Well, I gotta a little cash burning holes in my pocket
Foot on the gas, taking off like a rocket

[Chorus]
So come on, come on, baby, I'm buying
I got enough to last us all night and
You got the kiss that tastes like honey
And I got a little beer money
Tonight, tonight, baby, we're drinking
Let's wake the town that never stops sleeping
You got the kiss that tastes like honey
And I got a little beer money

[Verse 2]
We can dance in the dark
Blow the speakers out of this car
Light it up, burn it down
Until the morning rolls around

In a field where we can scream
Get away with almost anything
Yeah, every now and then you gotta raise a little hell
Hope we get lucky and stay out of jail

[Chorus]
So come on, come on, baby, I'm buying
I got enough to last us all night and
You got the kiss that tastes like honey
And I got a little beer money
Tonight, tonight, baby, we're drinking
Let's wake the town that never stops sleeping

People say I'm just a rough boy
I ain't no good for you girl
It's a dead end street, trying to love me

I can see why they're all talking
Looking back at my past
I've got a bad name but a man can change
I'm living proof of that

[Chorus]
Till my last day, till my last breath
Of everyone that can, I can love you the best
Till my last day, I'll be loving you
All the way up till they lay me down
Six feet under the cold hard ground
Till my last day, I'll be loving you

Baby I might meet all my friends
Shoot the bull, have a beer or two
But you know I'll be the first one to leave
In a hurry to get to you
Somewhere deep inside your angel eyes
I found a place to rest
Don't ever doubt that I'll be around
And baby don't you ever forget

Till my last day, till my last breath
Of everyone that can, I can love you the best
Till my last day, I'll be loving you
All the way up till they lay me down
Six feet under the cold hard ground

I saw you standing in the middle of the thunder and lightning
I know you're feeling like you just can't win, but you're trying
It's hard to keep on keeping on when you're being pushed around
Don't even know which way is up
You just keep spinnin' down, 'round down

[Chorus]
Every storm runs, runs out of rain
Just like every dark night turns into day
Every heartache will fade away
Just like every storm runs, runs out of rain

[Verse 2]
So hold your head up and tell yourself
That there's something more
And walk out that door
Go find a new rose
Don't be afraid of the thorns
'Cause we all have thorns
Just put your feet up to the edge
Put your face in the wind
And when you fall back down
Keep on rememberin'

[Chorus]
Every storm runs, runs out of rain
Just like every dark night turns into day
Every heartache will fade away
Just like every storm runs, runs out of rain

It's gonna run out of pain
It's gonna run out of sting
It's gonna leave you alone
It's gonna set you free, set you free

And from my bed I can feel the sun

I can hear the crazy

You were raised on an asphalt farm
Ain't never heard a rooster crow
Never walked barefoot by a river
Felt the mud up between your toes

You never thrown it in four wheel
Climb up on in here girl
Let me show you how country feels

Let your hair down, hair down
Get you some of this laid on back
Kick your shoes off, kick 'em off
Get you some of this slow down fast
I'll take you up and down these hollers and hills
Let me show you how country feels

[Verse 2]
Never watched the sun go down
From the bed of a pickup truck
Ever been so into somebody
You're still lying there when it comes back up

Cut a path through that cornfield
Park down by the water
Let me show you how country feels

All we do right is make love
And we both know now that ain’t enough

[Chorus]
Ain’t gonna beg you to stay
Ain't gotta ask you what's wrong
Ain’t no reason running after something already gone
Take off your leavin' dress
Let’s do what we do best
I guess everybody’s got their way of moving on
Girl rest your head one more time in my bed
Love me like you loved me when you loved me
And you didn’t have to try
Let’s lay down tonight
And kiss tomorrow goodbye

[Verse 2]
Baby who we are just didn’t work
But maybe we can leave with something out of all this hurt

59,59,Birthday Song,"[Intro: 2 Chainz]
Yeah birthday, it's your birthday
If I die bury me inside that Louis store

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
They ask me what I do and who I do it for
And how I come up with this shit up in the studio
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
When I die, bury me inside the Gucci store
When I die, bury me inside the Louis store
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
She got a big booty so I call her Big Booty
Scrr..Scrr.. wrists moving, cooking, getting to it
I'm in the kitchen, yams everywhere
Just made a jug, I got bands everywhere
You the realest nigga breathing if I hold my breath
Referee, with the whistle, brrrrrt, hold his tech
Extendo clip, extendo roll
When your girl leave me she need a hair salon
Hair weave killer going on a trapathon
See I done had more bombs than Pakistan
Dope bomb, dro bomb, and a pill bomb
See nigga, I'm balling, you in will call
When I die, bury me inside the jewelry store
When I die, bury me inside the Truey store
True to my religion, two everything I'm too different
So when I die, bury me next to two bitches

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Ah, Yeezy Yeezy how you do it huh
It's my birthday, I deserve to be greedy huh
She holding out, she ain't giving to the needy huh
You go downstairs and fall asleep with the TV on
Ya'll been together ten years, you deserve a ménage
Especially if you put that BMW in the garage
Especially if you paid a couple payments on her Mamma crib
Went to her niece's graduation, man I hate those kids
Last birthday she got you a new sweater
Put it on, give her a kiss, and tell her ""Do better !""
She said ""How bout I get you jewelry from the West End ?""
How bout she hit the Westin and get her best friend
I'm joking, I'm just serious, I asked her
Don't be acting like no actress, if we preaching then we practice
Don't be reaching, don't be touching shit
We in Kanye West's Benz
Cause I will turn you back to a pedestrian

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz & Kanye West]
It's your birthday, it's your birthday
Bad bitch contest, you in first place
You in first place, you in first place
Bad bitch contest, you in first place
I show up with a check to your work place
(Then hand the valet the keys to the Merces)
Tell the DJ play your song, this shit come on
(What I'm seeing from the back I can't front on)
They ask me what I do and who I do it for
When I die, bury me inside the booty club
Get it girl, get it girl, get it get it girl
I might switch it up and get your girl

[Hook]

[Outro: 2 Chainz (Kanye West)]
Deuce and Ye
We like Snoop and Dre
Isn't this your birthday, baby
You deserve a coupe today
(You in first place, you in first place)
(Bad bitch contest you in first place)

60,60,Remember You,"[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
She's about to earn some bragging rights
I'm 'bout to give it up like I've been holding back all night
Girl, take pride in what you want to do
Even if that means a new man every night inside of you
Baby, I don't mind
You can tell by how I roll
Cause my clique hot and my cup cold
My talk slurred cause I’m so throwed
And I'm wiping sweat from my last show
And he's TG and I'm XO
I'm only here for one night
Then I'ma be a memory
Say it in my ear, so I can hear what you say to me
I got cups full of that Rosé
Smoke anything that's passed to me
Don't worry 'bout my voice
I won't need it for what I'm about to do to you

[Hook: The Weeknd]
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I might have to take your number when I'm through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I might have to take your number when I'm through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Old rapping ass
Light years past the class
Hit it, don't have to pass
Nigga, we the new Aftermath
Niggas after fame, I just had to laugh
Niggas after fame, I'm after cash
You's a fan, I'm a player
I'm the man, you's a hater
And I only smoke papers
That's how you tell I'm Taylor'd
Nigga listen
Break it down, rolling weed on the island of my kitchen
And not a thing goes down without permission
Look, everything I got on I was made for
Everything that I got I done came for
All the shit that you see I done slaved for
All the cars and the crib, yeah that's paid for
Need I say more
Spend so much money on clothes
Said fuck a store, making my own
I hope that you're rolling one up while you're singing along
And know I was rolling one while I was making this song
Pour out some shots
You're taking too long
Young and I'm rich
And plus all of my friends on that Bombay and lemonade

[Hook: The Weeknd]
Do to you
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I might have to take your number when I'm through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I might have to take your number when I'm through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm on some gin, you on some gin
I'm moving slow, I'm driving fast
I hit the weed, you take the wheel
We lose control
Drop the top in that 69
And that motor roar in that old Chevelle
Can’t say a thing, how you supposed to feel
Stacking all of this paper, dawg
I like to call this shit old news
And these haters jocking our old moves
Popping champagne cause we made it
Back of the Phantom, we faded
All of this shit that I did I probably won't remember tomorrow

[Hook: The Weeknd]
Do to you
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I might have to take your number when I'm through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I might have to take your number when I'm through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me

61,61,Ball,"[Verse 1: T.I.]
Okay we walk off in this bitch, ballin’ in this bitch
Hoppin’ out of Lambos and Ferraris in this bitch
Poppin’ bottles with a thick red super model bitch
They may talk a lot of that but they can't do a lot of this
Ay, Rico told me turn the lights on
So I grab the Audemar and threw the ice on
I’ma big dawg, got em pissed off
A lot of niggas rapping, ain’t none this raw
They like, eh look at T.I., ballin’ in the V.I
Bunch of bad bitches with him looking like Aaliyah
We just pull up, hop out, go in, show out
Buy the whole bar, pop bottles go hard

[Chorus: Rico Love & (T.I.)]
This club so packed, these hoes so drunk
This club so packed, these hoes so drunk

(I got a bottle, got a model, got a molly, got a blunt)

[Verse 2: T.I.]
The club full of bad bitches and they came to play
Okay it must be your ass cause it ain't your face
Now if you looking for them bottles and them stacks, girl
You make your way up to my section where it’s at, girl
Okay now do you wanna kick it with a nigga with a meal ticket
Broke niggas looking mad, they just gotta deal with it
Get right ho, roll a dice ho
And you ain't gotta be a dyke cause you like hoes
For everyday I spent behind the wall
I do it big, ride, fly, stunt, shine and ball
I got a bunch of money, so come and get it from me
And a bucket full of bottles, bust it open
If you wanna get drunk

[Chorus: Rico Love & (T.I.)]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga
Pop that pussy like a gun, pull the trigger
Shake that ass like a salt shaker
I keep a L lit up like an elevator
Bitch, shake it like a dog, hop like a frog, ride it like a horse
I throw that dick like darts
Drink all muddy, flag all bloody
I’m killin’ these hoes like that nigga Ted Bundy
I’m a good looking rapper, I ain’t tryna stunt
I'ma fire my blunt like Donald Trump
Where you at, ho? Where you at, ho?
Can a nigga stick key up in ya back door?
Tunechi

[Verse 4: T.I.]
And do ya thing in slow motion like Soulja Slim
And come around, wipe me down like Boosie (Free Boosie)
That thang up for me, show me that you love me
If it’s really too much for you you can bring a couple buddies
Everyday I do my thang, big stones and chains
She let me drill all in her mouth, no novacaine
Them other broke niggas, all they did was told ya thangs
I could get ya on that G4 and show ya thangs
I like my women fat ass, pretty toes and thangs
Long hair don't care long as none down there
If it's manicured I can have fun down there
Take you to whatever club, throw some money in the air

62,62,Madness,"...Even though you think
You've taught it through
Think of me that would miss you too
I've helped you before
Let's do it once more...

Behind enemy lines
Beyond what lies in my mind
Eyes full of lies
Have set their gaze upon me
To watch me grow weary

I kneel and pray
They would grant me peace
Wishing they would cease
To make me sink deeper
To watch me drown with laughter

'Worry not I've never left
This dwelling of mine

Follow me through the abysmal
Hole in your soul
I'll shelter you from harm

Clouded by this maddening haze
Through the eyes of dementia
A torched dimension
Yearns to consume
The entire world seems to be
Bound to a pyre
Quick to be devoured by the scorching
Heat of the flames

Enchanting vision of my own demise

Drifts into my mind
Casting doubt and fear
Ephemeral lucidity
Overpowering anxiety
Endless illness

'Resistance is futile
For not only do i possess you
I Am You
I 'am your muse in madness
You are my slave, my hostage","['even', 'though', 'you', 'think', 'youve', 'teach', 'it', 'through', 'think', 'of', 'me', 'that', 'would', 'miss', 'you', 'too', 'ive', 'help', 'you', 'before', 'let', 'do', 'it', 'once', 'more', 'behind', 'enemy', 'line', 'beyond', 'what', 'lie', 'in', 'my', 'mind', 'eye', 'full', 'of', 'lie', 'have', 'set', 'their', 'gaze', 'upon', 'me', 'to', 'watch', 'me', 'grow', 'weary', 'i', 'kneel', 'and', 'pray', 'they', 'would', 'grant', 'me', 'peace', 'wish', 'they', 'would', 'cease', 'to', 'make', 'me', 'sink', 'deeper', 'to', 'watch', 'me', 'drown', 'with', 'laughter', 'worry', 'not', 'ive', 'never', 'leave', 'this', 'dwell', 'of', 'mine', 'follow', 'me', 'through', 'the', 'abysmal', 'hole', 'in', 'your', 'soul', 'ill', 'shelter', 'you', 'from', 'harm', 'cloud', 'by', 'this', 'madden', 'haze', 'through', 'the', 'eye', 'of', 'dementia', 'a', 'torch', 'dimension', 'yearn', 'to', 'consume', 'the', 'entire', 'world', 'seem', 'to', 'be', 'bind', 'to', 'a', 'pyre', 'quick', 'to', 'be', 'devour', 'by', 'the', 'scorch', 'heat', 'of', 'the', 'flame', 'enchant', 'vision', 'of', 'my', 'own', 'demise', 'drift', 'into', 'my', 'mind', 'cast', 'doubt', 'and', 'fear', 'ephemeral', 'lucidity', 'overpower', 'anxiety', 'endless', 'illness', 'resistance', 'be', 'futile', 'for', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'i', 'possess', 'you', 'i', 'be', 'you', 'i', 'be', 'your', 'muse', 'in', 'madness', 'you', 'be', 'my', 'slave', 'my', 'hostage']",178,Brought by Pain,Muse,2012,"[65, 67, 66, 68, 64, 63, 67, 61, 66, 60, 64, 69, 79, 82, 91, 95, 84]",17,Madness,https://open.spotify.com/track/0c4IEciLCDdXEhhKxj4ThA,0c4IEciLCDdXEhhKxj4ThA,spotify:track:0c4IEciLCDdXEhhKxj4ThA,The 2nd Law,3KuXEGcqLcnEYWnn3OEGy0,spotify:album:3KuXEGcqLcnEYWnn3OEGy0,Muse,12Chz98pHFMPJEknJQMWvI,spotify:artist:12Chz98pHFMPJEknJQMWvI,281.04,13.0,69.0,2012-09-24,0.502,0.41700000000000004,10.0,-7.665,1.0,0.0718,0.127,0.00419,0.106,0.218,180.301,"['modern rock', 'permanent wave', 'piano rock', 'post-grunge', 'rock']",[],1.0

Start a little storm
Make a little rain

I'm going to leave you guessing how this funnel is going to hit

64,64,Did It For The Girl,"I got the Chevy all shined up
Paid a little more for a hair cut
Ironed up a pearl snap, left that old ball cap
Gave myself a little extra smell good splash

I did it for the girl dancin' in the sunset
Get to see her sippin' on Corona, little silhouette
Did it for the moonlight, slow ride, slidin' over by my side
Been waiting on that all night kiss, I did it for the girl

I dialed her up some more George Strait
Me and old George sang Marina Del Rey
There by the water's edge, big sky turnin' red
That perfect night, she said she can't forget

I did it for the girl dancin' in the sunset
Get to see her sippin' on Corona, little silhouette
Did it for the moonlight, slow ride, slidin' over by my side
Been waiting on that all night kiss, I did it for the girl

I did it for that long hair, fallin' down, layin' on her shoulders
Those blue eyes want me to hold her

I did it for the girl dancin' in the sunset
Get to see her sippin' on Corona, little silhouette
Did it for the moonlight, slow ride, slidin' over by my side
Been waiting on that all night kiss

I did it for the girl dancin' on the front porch
Reachin' out to grab my shirt, pull me through the front door

I don't wanna go there
We should never go there
Damn, why you wanna go there?
I guess I gotta go there

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
You're hearing rumors about me and you can't stomach the thought
Of someone touching my body when you're so close to my heart
I won't deny what they saying because most of it is true
But it was all before I fell for you, so please, babe

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
So please don't judge me and I won't judge you
'Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful
Please don't judge me and I won't judge you
And if you love me, then let it be beautiful

(Oh)
Let it be beautifu-u-ul (Oh)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Everything I say right now is gonna be used in another fight
And I've been through this so many times
Can we change the subject?
You gonna start asking me questions like
""Was she attractive? Was she an actress?""
Baby, the fact is

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
You're hearing rumors about me and saw some pictures online
Saying they got you so angry, making you wish you were blind
Before we start talking crazy, saying some things we'll regret
Can we just slow it down and press reset? (Damn)
You're beautiful, so baby

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
(So baby)
So please don't judge me and I won't judge you
'Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful
Please don't judge me and I won't judge you
And if you love me, then let it be beautiful

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Just let the past, just be the past
And focused on things that are gonna make us laugh
Take me as I am (Take me as I am) and not who I was (Not who I was)
I'll promise I'll be the one that you can trust, so please

[Chorus: Chris Brown, with Sevyn Streeter]
So please don't judge me (Don't judge me)
And I won't judge you (And I won't 'cause)

You might be a redneck ...

The Grand Ole Opry coming to you live from ...

[Verse 1]
When your wheelhouse is the land of cotton
The first time you leave it can be strange, it can be shockin'
Not everybody drives a truck, not everybody drinks sweet tea
Not everybody owns a gun, wears a ball cap, boots, and jeans
Not everybody goes to church
Or watches every NASCAR race
Not everybody knows the words to
""Ring Of Fire"" or ""Amazing Grace""

[Chorus]
Oh, Dixie Land
I hope you understand
When I miss my Tennessee home
And I've been away way too long
I can't see this world unless I go
Outside my southern comfort zone

[Verse 2]
I have walked the streets of Rome, I have been to foreign lands
I know what it's like to talk and have nobody understand
I have seen the Eiffel Tower lit up on a Paris night
I have kissed a West Coast girl underneath the Northern Lights
I know what it's like to be the only one like me
To take a good hard look around and be a minority

[Chorus]
And I miss my Tennessee home
I can see the ways that I've grown
I can't see this world unless I go
Outside my southern comfort zone

[Bridge]
I miss your biscuits and your gravy
Fireflies dancing in the night
You have fed me, you have saved me
Billy Graham and Martha White
I have since become a drifter
And I just can't wait to pack
Cause I know the route I leave on
It will always bring me back

I wish I was in Dixie Again
I miss my Tennessee Home
I've been away way too long
I can't see this world unless I go
Outside my southern comfort zone

67,67,Let It Be,"SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE OF MONELL POLICY AND PRACTICE OF TORTURE AND COVER-UP, AND OF DEFENDANTS MARTIN’S, SHINES’, NEEDHAM’S AND HILLARD’S INVOLVEMENT [REDACTED]

1. Mayor Richard M. Daley was the States’ Attorney of Cook County from 1981 through 1988, and he has served as Mayor of the City of Chicago from 1989 to the present.

2. On or about February 25, 1982, Police Superintendent Richard Brzeczek informed States Attorney Richard M. Daley by letter of the allegations made by Dr. John Raba, that Andrew Wilson had been beaten and electric shocked by Chicago Police detectives at Area 2 on February 14, 1982. 2/25/82 Brzeczek Letter to Daley; Brzeczek Affidavit.

3. Brzeczek further informed Daley that he would not initiate a criminal investigation into the allegations that Wilson was tortured unless Daley authorized such an investigation. Id.

4. Daley never authorized a criminal investigation, and the Chicago Police Department therefore did not initiate a criminal investigation into Wilson’s allegations, and on May 19, 1983, Daley honored Burge and four other Area 2 detectives for their work in the Wilson case” Brzeczek Dep., Wilson v. City of Chicago, pp 123-24; Brzeczek Affidavit; Chicago Tribune, 5/20/83, “Daley Hails 11 in Crime War.”

5. The Chicago Police Department never investigated numerous allegations of police torture and abuse which arose from the manhunt to find and arrest Andrew Wilson and which were lodged with its IAD and OPS in February of 1982. Wilson v. City of Chicago, 6 F3d 1230 (7th Cir. 1993).

6. On November 12, 1982, Andrew Wilson testified at his motion to suppress hearing that he was tortured by Jon Burge, John Yucaitis, and other Area 2 detectives by electric shock, bagging, beating and burning on a radiator. People v. Wilson. 2

7. In their Memorandum In Opposition To Motion To Bar Testimony Concerning Other Alleged Victims of Police Misconduct, filed on January 22, 1992 before the Chicago Police Board in the Matter of Charges Filed against Respondents Jon Burge, John Yucaitis and Patrick O’Hara, Cases # 1856-58, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of the City of Chicago and Chicago Police Superintendent Leroy Martin, judicially admitted that: At the hearing, Andrew Wilson will testify that on February 14, 1982, he was arrested at an apartment by several officers, including respondents Burge and Yucaitis. As Wilson was being taken to the car to be transported to Area II, he heard Burge telling the transporting officers not to “mess with” Wilson and that they would deal with him when they arrived at the station. Wilson was then taken to Area II by Yucaitis and three other officers. Transcript of Testimony of Andrew Wilson, July 7, 10, 11, 1989, at 2914-31 When they arrived at Area II, Wilson was taken to a room where the four transporting officers, including Yucaitis, and other officers started beating him. They hit him, kicked him, knocked him down and slammed him into a window so hard that it broke. In addition, one of the officers grabbed a plastic garbage bag and put it over Wilson’s head, holding it around his neck so that he could not breathe. The officers took the bag off when Wilson bit a hole in it. The officers stopped beating Wilson when Burge entered the room and stated that if it had been him, he would not have left any marks on Wilson. Tr. at 2932-36 Wilson was taken to a second room and handcuffed to the wall. Yucaitis then took Wilson to a telephone and told him to call his brother. When Wilson replied that he did not want to talk but wanted a lawyer, he was taken back to the second room again handcuffed to the wall. Tr. At 2937-44. Burge entered the room and told Wilson he was going to make a statement because Burge’s reputation was at stake. Burge left the room and Yucaitis came in with a brown paper bag. Yucaitis opened the bag and took out a black box about 12-14 inches long, 8-9 inches wide and 6 ½-7 inches high. The box had a crank and two wires with clamps. Yucaitis squatted down in front of Wilson with the box between his own legs, and put one clamp in Wilson’s nose and one on Wilson’s ears, and cranked the box. The shock caused Wilson’s teeth to grind and was so painful that he kicked Yucaitis. Yucaitis punched him in the mouth and cranked the box again. Yucaitis left the room and then returned, put the black box in the bag, and left again. Tr. at 2947-55. Respondent O’Hara then came in and took Wilson to see the Assistant State’s Attorney, Lawrence Hyman. According to Wilson’s testimony, with O’Hara present, Wilson asked Hyman, “You want me to make a statement after they’ve been torturing me?” O’Hara took Wilson back to the second room. Tr. at 2956-59. Burge later returned to the second room with the brown paper bag and said, “Fun time.” Burge put a pair of handcuffs on Wilson’s other arm and another pair on Wilson’s 3 ankles. He then placed the bag in the garbage can and left. He returned, took out the black box, put the clamps on Wilson’s ears and cranked the box. The shock caused Wilson’s to grind his teeth and knocked Wilson out of his chair. Wilson kept rubbing the clips from the electrical device off his ears. Tr at 2961-63. Wilson was then handcuffed across the radiator, kneeling with his arms outstretched. Burge and another officer put the clamps on Wilson’s little fingers and cranked the box repeatedly this time for longer periods. As he was being shocked, Wilson’s chest, leg and face were forced against the radiator and he was burned. Tr. at 2963-66 When Burge stopped cranking and took the clamps off Wilson’s little fingers, he took another shocking device out of the bag. It plugged into an electrical outlet and had a cord sticking out of it. Burge placed the device very near Wilson’s skin so that he could feel it tingling. Burge then jabbed the second device into Wilson’s back and Wilson got a full jolt, slamming Wilson into the grill on the window. Wilson began spitting out blood. Burge and the other officer put the devices back in the bag and left. Tr. at 296-68. A while later, Wilson was taken to Area I headquarters for a lineup. At Area I, Burge stuck his gun in Wilson’s mouth and cocked it back and forth. When Wilson arrived back at Area II after the lineup, Burge told him that if he did not make a statement, he would shock him again. Later, Burge told Wilson he was going to “fry his black ass.” Tr. at 2969-75. Memorandum In Opposition, pp.4-6.

8. In February of 1992, Andrew Wilson testified before the Police Board on behalf of the City in the Matter of Charges Filed against Respondents Jon Burge, John Yucaitis and Patrick O’Hara, Cases # 1856-58, and described his torture in a manner consistent with how the City described it in its January 22, 1992 Memorandum In Opposition To Motion To Bar Testimony Concerning Other Alleged Victims of Police Misconduct, at pp. 4-6; Police Board Testimony of Andrew Wilson.

9. In Wilson v. City of Chicago, 86-C-2360, the City of Chicago, who was a Defendant in that case, admitted in its Amended Answer, dated July 13, 1995, that Andrew Wilson was tortured by Jon Burge on February 14, 1982.

10. Melvin Jones testified on August 5, 1982 at his motion to suppress hearing that he was arrested and transported to Area 2 at 92nd and Cottage Grove on February 5, 1982, and 4 placed in an interview room. People v. Melvin Jones, 8/5/82, pp. 61-62.

11. Melvin Jones testified that while being held in an interview room and interrogated, Lieutenant Jon Burge pulled up a chair and sat in front of Jones who was cuffed to the wall, that Burge had a little wooden box with a long cord, that Burge pulled down Jones’ pants to his ankles and electrically shocked Jones on his foot, then on his thigh and then on his penis. Jones testified that he kept hollering and telling Burge that he wasn’t supposed to do this to him, that Burge said to him that he had no proof, that Burge asked detective Flood, who was present for the shocking, if he saw anything and Flood looked at the ceiling and said no. Jones further stated that Burge said, “[n]o court and no State are going to take your word against a Lieutenant’s word,” and Burge later hit him in the head with a stapler. People v. Jones, 8/5/82, pp. 65-71, 74.

12. Melvin Jones further testified that on February 6, 1982, while he was still being detained in an Area 2 interview room, Defendant McWeeny entered the room with another detective and questioned Jones, after which Lieutenant Burge entered the room and asked McWeeny if Jones had started talking yet. Jones further stated that when McWeeny said Jones hadn’t said anything yet, Burge pulled out a gun and cocked it, put it up to Jones’ head and said
he was going to “blow Jones’ black head off.” Id. pp. 76-79.

13. Melvin Jones testified on February 19, 1992 on behalf of the City at the Chicago Police Board Hearing, that McWeeny told Burge to get out of the room and McWeeny stated to him later that evening that he [McWeeny] “had got the Lieutenant off me for right now. He said, if you are going to talk, you know, it would be easier for me.” Id. at 79; Chicago Police Board, 2/19/92, p. 856.

14. Cassandra Watson, Melvin Jones’ attorney in 1982, testified at the Chicago Police 5 Board Hearings on 2/19/92 that Jones told her within the first 10 days of February, 1982 that he had been beaten and threatened at Area 2, that while he was in an interview room at Area 2 a gun had been placed to his head, and that Lieutenant Burge had electrically shocked him with an electrical shock box. Chicago Police Board Proceedings, 2/19/92, pp. 960-62.

15. Jones testified on behalf of the City in the Police Board proceedings against Burge, and again identified Burge as the person who tortured him. Id., p. 826).

16. In their Memorandum In Opposition, filed on January 22, 1992 before the Chicago Police Board, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of Chicago Police Superintendent Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted that: Melvin Jones will testify that on February 5, 1982, just nine days prior to Andrew Wilson’s arrest, he was taken to an Area II interrogation room where he was handcuffed and questioned by Area II detectives concerning his knowledge and participation in a murder. When he failed to give information implicating himself in the murder, respondent Burge entered the room and told Jones that he was going to talk. Burge then asked Jones if he had ever heard of him, and when Jones replied that he had not, Burge told him that before he left the station Jones would “wish he had never set eyes on him.” Burge left the interrogation room but returned after Jones persisted in his refusal to talk to the interrogating detectives. Burge had Jones cuffed to a second ring and then produced and plugged into the wall socket a wooden box measuring approximately 10"" x 6"" x 6"", with tweezers and a long nail type device. He again asked Jones if he was going to talk. When Jones again refused, Burge pulled down Jones’ pants and shorts and, using
the electrical device, shocked Jones three times, on the foot, thigh, and penis. While he was shocking Jones, Burge demanded that Jones talk. He told Jones that he had also shocked “Satan” (Anthony Holmes) and “Cochise,” forcing them to crawl all over the floor. He also told Jones that nobody would believe his word against a lieutenant’s. Burge asked another Area II detective present in the room if he had seen anything, and the detective looked at the ceiling and said no. Burge also tied a sock in Jones’ mouth. Burge was interrupted in his interrogation of Jones, apparently by the news that a policeman had been shot and killed on a bus in his area. Later, Burge also struck Jones with a stapler. When Jones continued to deny knowing anything about the murder, Burge again entered the interrogation room. He pointed a gun at Jones’ head, cocked it and told Jones he was going to “blow his black head off.” 6

Men” which was tendered by counsel for Andrew Wilson to the Committee and its counsel at the Chicago City Council Hearings held on December 24, 1990, listed more than thirty victims of alleged torture at Area 2, including Aaron Patterson, Madison Hobley, Stanley Howard, and Leroy Orange.

87. At the Christmas Eve hearing, evidence that SA Daley refused to investigate when requested to do so by Superintendent Brzeczek. was presented, and Daley responded publicly, with his office stating that “Andrew Wilson refused to testify before the grand jury about the 19 allegations.” Chicago Tribune, 12/25/90, “Hearing Examines Brutality Charges;” Chicago Sun Times, 12/25/90, “Davis Urges New Review of Police Brutality Cases.”

88. The “Fact Sheet: Evidence of Police Torture By Commander Jon Burge and His
Men” which listed more than thirty victims of alleged torture at Area 2, including Aaron Patterson, Madison Hobley, Stanley Howard, and Leroy Orange, was tendered by counsel for Andrew Wilson to Superintendent Leroy Martin on or about December 19, 1990.

89. In a letter dated January 9, 1991, OPS Director Gayle Shines wrote to counsel for Andrew Wilson that “Superintendent Martin has referred to me your letter of 19 December and the attached Fact Sheet.”

90. The City Council or its Finance committee never issued a report or took any other action after the December 24th torture hearings.

91. On January 28, 1991, Amnesty International issued a Report calling for “a full inquiry into allegations that Chicago police systematically tortured criminal suspects from 1972 to 1984,” and in response, the spokesman for Mayor Daley said she had “‘no comment whatsoever.’” Chicago Sun Times, 1/28/91, “Police Torture Probe Sought Here.”

92. On or about November 2, 1990 OPS Director Gayle Shines approved as
“compelling” and forwarded to Superintendent Martin the 25 page Report and findings made by OPS investigator Michael Goldston concerning allegations of torture and abuse at Area 2. This Report included the following findings:
As to the matter of alleged physical abuse, the preponderance of the evidence is that abuse did occur and that it was systematic. The time span involved covers more than ten years. The type of abuse described was not limited to the usual beating, but went into such esoteric areas as psychological techniques and planned torture. The evidence presented by some individuals convinced juries and appellate courts that personnel assigned to Area 2 engaged in methodical abuse. 20 The number of incidents in which an Area 2 command member is identified as an accused can lead to only one conclusion. Particular command members were aware of the systematic abuse and participated in it either by actively participating in same or failing to take any action to bring it to an end. This conclusion is also supported by the number of incidents in which Area 2 offices are named as the location of the abuse.
OPS Special Project Conclusion Reports and Findings, and Cover Letter, Shines to Martin, dated November 2, 1990 (Goldston Report).

93. In her forwarding memo of November 2, 1990, OPS Director Shines, while
approving the conclusions of Goldston and Sanders, further informed Superintendent Martin that they both did “a masterful job of marshaling the facts in this intensive and extensive project and their conclusions are compelling.” 11/2/90 Cover Memo, Shines to Martin, with OPS Special Project Conclusion Reports and Findings enclosed.

94. On or about November 2, 1990, OPS Director Gayle Shines approved “as
compelling” and forwarded to Superintendent Martin the 66 page report and conclusions of OPS investigator Francine Sanders which found that based on “the overwhelming body of evidence which supports the allegations” that administrative charges of excessive force should be sustained against Jon Burge and John Yucaitis including that they “repeatedly administered electrical stimulation to Mr [Andrew] Wilson’s body in order to create pain” and that Burge “held Mr. Wilson, while handcuffed, against a hot radiator causing burns to Mr. Wilson’s face, chest and thigh.” Chicago Police Office of Professional Standards (OPS) Special Investigative Report and Findings, October 26, 1990 (Sanders Report), pp.62-66.

95. Martin acknowledged the “ serious nature” of Goldston’s conclusions Martin memo to Shines, 11/18/90.

96. At no time from receiving the Goldston Report in November of 1990 until he left 21 office in April of 1992, did Martin, OPS Director Shines, or any other City policymaking official take any steps to further investigate the allegations made by the some fifty victims listed in the Goldston report.

97. Instead, Martin, after waiting three months, wrote Shines seeking “further
clarification” concerning the Goldston and Sanders Reports. Memo, Martin to Shines, 2/6/91.

98. Despite all of the torture evidence contained in the Goldston and Sanders Reports, in the Fact Sheet, and that was previously presented to Martin and the City Council, the City and Martin did not seek the prosecution of Burge and his confederates in the Wilson case, for a continuing conspiracy on the basis of the numerous other torture cases listed in the Goldston report, or to prosecute Burge for the numerous other cases which were documented in the
evidence presented, including the Patterson and Madison Hobley cases.

99. In her April 30, 1991 memorandum to Martin, Shines supplied the “clarifications” sought by Martin, and informed him that the OPS findings “reflect the unprecedented comprehensiveness of this investigation.” Shines memo, 4/30/91.

100. With her April 30, 1991 memorandum to Superintendent Martin, OPS Director
Shines included investigator Goldston’s clarification memo, in which Goldston set forth that his investigation established that Area 2 detectives and supervisors Jon Burge, John Byrne, Peter Dignan, Charles Grunhard, John Yucaitis, Thomas McKenna, and Patrick O’Hara were “players”
whose names “repeatedly appeared as connected to allegations of abuse.” Goldston Memo of 4/30/91, attached to Shines Memo to Martin of the same date.

101. After waiting an additional seven months, in November of 1991, Superintendent Leroy Martin approved the findings set forth in the Chicago Police Office of Professional 22 Standards (OPS) Special Investigative Report and Findings, dated October 26, 1990 (Sanders Report), Burge and Yucaitis were administratively charged by the CPD for abusing Andrew Wilson in the manner found in the Report, and separation proceedings were initiated before the
Chicago Police Board. Cr 123543 (reopened).

102. However, after secret communications with Corporation Counsel Kelly Welch, which the City still refuses to produce, Martin refused to accept or adopt the Goldston findings, open any additional criminal or administrative investigations into the numerous allegations of Area 2 torture, to commission additional investigation into the alleged systemic pattern and practice of torture, or to discipline or seek criminal charges against any of the named officers, but rather contacted the Police Foundation in order to have them evaluate the methodology used by Goldston in arriving at his findings. Martin Letter to Williams, 11/8/91; City Privilege Log.

103. During this time period, community groups, including Citizen’s Alert, by letters and in face to face meetings, were demanding that Martin release the results of the OPS investigation into torture at Area 2. Powers Letter to Martin, 8/14/91.

104. Instead, Martin, through his lawyers at the Corporation Counsel’s Office, fought production and public release of the Goldston Report and its findings. See, generally, proceedings in Fallon v. Dillon, 90 C 6722.

105. In November of 1991, after Defendant Martin and Corporation Counsel Kelly
Welsh had initiated proceedings before the Police Board to fire Burge, Yucaitis and O’Hara for torturing Andrew Wilson, Mayor Daley “defended his decision not to take action against the officers when he was state’s attorney in 1982, explaining that . . [Wilson] refused to cooperate with his office at that time.” Chicago Tribune, 11/26/91 “3 Cops Face Hearing in Torture Case.” 23

106. On or about February 7, 1992, the Goldston and Sanders were publicly released, over the City’s strenuous objection, pursuant to the order of Judge Milton Shadur in the case of Fallon v. Dillon, #90-C-6722.

107. In an article which appeared in the February 8, 1992 Chicago Tribune,
Superintendent Leroy Martin, whgo was one of the previous Area 2 Commanders, was quoted as saying that it was an “outright lie” that Area 2 commanders knew about or condoned torture. Chicago Tribune, “13 Years of Cop Torture Alleged,” February 8, 1992.

108. In the same article, Mayor Richard M. Daley was quoted as saying of the Report, “these are only allegations . . . not substantiated cases,” as defending Martin’s suppression of the report, stating: “it’s allegations, rumors, stories, things like that” and of denying that the torture
at Area 2 was “systematic.” Chicago Tribune, 2/8/92, “13 Years of Cop Torture Alleged;” Los Angeles Times, 2/8/92, “Chicago Police Used Torture Report Says,”

109. In their Memorandum In Opposition To Motion To Bar Testimony Concerning
Other Alleged Victims of Police Misconduct, filed on January 22, 1992 before the Police Board in the Matter of Charges Filed against Respondents Jon Burge, John Yucaitis and Patrick O’Hara, Cases # 1856-58, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of Chicago Police Superintendent Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, made the following judicial admission concerning the testimony of “seven additional victims of torture tactics at Area II
headquarters:” The testimony regarding similar acts sets forth detailed accounts of tortuous treatment that are almost identical to the torture suffered by Andrew Wilson. The testimony reveals an astounding pattern or plan on the part of respondents [Burge, Yucaitis and O’Hara] to torture certain suspects, often with substantial criminal records, into confessing to crimes
or to condone such activity. 24 Memorandum In Opposition To Motion To Bar Testimony Concerning Other Alleged Victims of Police Misconduct, p. 1.

110. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,
on behalf of Superintendent Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, identified the “seven
additional victims of torture tactics at Area II headquarters” as Melvin Jones, Anthony Holmes,
George Powell, Donald White, Shadeed Mumin, Leroy Orange, and Lawrence Poree. Id., pp. 7-
14.
111. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,
on behalf of Martin and the City, made the following judicial admission - - - that the similar acts
testimony of Melvin Jones, Anthony Holmes, George Powell, Donald White, Shadeed Mumin,
Leroy Orange, and Lawrence Poree
[I]s highly probative of the modus operandi used or condoned in the torturing of suspects
to elicit statements. Respondents [Burge, Yucaitis and O’Hara’s] methods of torture
through electric shock, bagging, and holding a gun to a suspect’s head are more that
sufficiently unique to establish a modus operandi for 404 b purposes. In addition, the
testimony establishes a pattern of and plan to torture these suspects in these similar ways
to elicit confessions to violent crimes.
Id. p. 17.
112. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,
on behalf of Martin and the City, judicially admitted that the similar acts testimony of Melvin
Jones, Anthony Holmes, George Powell, Donald White, Shadeed Mumin, Leroy Orange, and
Lawrence Poree:
clearly establishes respondents’ [Burge, Yucaitis and O’Hara’s] motive and intent in
torturing or condoning the torture of Wilson. Respondents generally engaged in these
similar practices in order to coerce a confession to a serious crime.
Id. p. 22. 25
113. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,
on behalf of Martin and the City, judicially admitted that the similar acts testimony of Melvin
Jones, Anthony Holmes, George Powell, Donald White, Shadeed Mumin, Leroy Orange, and
Lawrence Poree:
shows the physical existence of one or more electric shock devices at Area II, prior to
and subsequent to Wilson’s arrest, and Burge’s possession of and familiarity with the use
of the devices. It is also admissible to show knowledge of that technique and of the
bagging technique, about which respondents deny knowing, and the technique of putting
a gun to the head of a victim.
Id., p. 24.
114. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,
on behalf of Martin and the City, made the following judicial admission:
There is no question that the similarities between [Andrew] Wilson’s testimony
and the similar victims’ testimony is more than sufficient to meet the 404 b standard.
Burge was the main perpetrator of the torture in almost all of the cases, and, when he was
not the principal, he was still involved. In the case of all but one of the victims, the
victim was picked up and taken to Area II where he was then interrogated regarding his
knowledge or involvement in a serious offense. Although Donald White was taken
instead to Area I, he was taken there and interrogated by Area II detectives. All of the
victims were black and generally had significant criminal histories.
Also similar was the way in which several victims were threatened with
consequences if they refused to make a statement. After an initial refusal, the
punishment would begin and then would become stronger and more painful as the
refusals to speak persisted. The most striking similarities, however, are found in the
methods of torture used on the suspects. Wilson was electro shocked by Yucaitis using
the black box and by Burge who used the black box and a curling-iron looking device,
was “bagged” and beaten, and was threatened with a gun placed in his mouth. Jones,
Holmes, Poree, Powell and Orange were similarly electro shocked by Burge. Holmes,
Powell, White and Mumin were all “bagged” and beaten to the point where they lost or
almost lost consciousness. Burge pointed a cocked gun at Jones’s head, hit Poree in the
head with a pistol, and placed a revolver containing one bullet at Mumin’s head and
snapped it three times slowly. White had a gun placed in his mouth. Additionally, each
of the victims was slapped around and punched.
Burge’s statements to the victims were also very similar. Burge told both Jones
and Mumin that nobody would ever believe their word against his. As he did in relation
to Wilson, he referred to the absence of marks on Mumin’s body. He said “fun time” as 26
he approached Wilson and Poree with the black box, and laughed when he bagged
Mumin. He told Wilson he would “fry his black ass” and Jones he would “blow his
black head off.”
As the case law cited above aptly demonstrates, these actions or the condoning of
these actions are overwhelming in their similarity.
Id., pp. 25-26.
115. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,
on behalf of Chicago Police Superintendent Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, made the
following judicial admission:
Given the similarities between the serious offenses charged and the offenses to which the
similar victims will testify, there is no question that the offenses are close enough in time
to be relevant to this case. Tak[ing] the offenses in sequence, they reveal a pattern of
almost identical acts of torture directed towards persons suspected of violent crimes.
While the sequence spans twelve years, each offense is close enough to the next to
connect it to the relevant pattern of behavior. Moreover, Melvin Jones’ and Donald
White’s testimony will demonstrate that they were tortured just days before Andrew
Wilson was tortured.
Id., p. 28.
116. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,
on behalf of Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted:
Indeed, as the testimony of the similar victims shows, respondents [Burge, Yucaitis and
O’Hara] counted on the fact that their testimony would be believed over that of a convict
when they persisted in their pattern of torture.
Id., p. 28.
117. In a document filed in the case of Wilson v. City of Chicago, Jon Burge, Patrick
O’Hara and John Yucaitis, 86-C-2360, entitled “City of Chicago’s Memorandum in Response
To Plaintiff Andrew Wilson’s Motion for Summary Judgment,” the City, through its lawyers,
made the following judicial admission:
Plaintiff Andrew Wilson has testified that he was beaten, kicked, punched, burned by
being harnessed to a radiator, and repeatedly electro shocked on his hands, face, ears, and 27
between his legs by defendant police officers. Plaintiff now seeks summary judgment that
this outrageous conduct, unsanctioned and condemned by the City, and for which
defendant officers were fired and/or disciplined, was within the defendants’ scope of
employment.
City Memorandum in Response To Plaintiff Wilson’s Motion for Summary Judgment, p. 1.
118. In a document filed in the case of Wilson v. City of Chicago, 86-C-2360, entitled
“City of Chicago’s Memorandum in Response To Plaintiff Andrew Wilson’s Motion for
Summary Judgment,” the City, through its lawyers, made the following judicial admission:
The instrumentalities by which defendants tortured plaintiff also illustrate that defendant
officers were not in the scope of their employment. Plaintiff has failed to furnish any
evidence to suggest that the instruments used by the officers to shock him - - -the black
box device and the modified curling iron - - were furnished by the City.
Id., p. 17.
119. In its Memorandum in Response To Plaintiff Andrew Wilson’s Motion for
Summary Judgment,” the City, through its lawyers, made the judicial admission that
Burge “cruelly torture[d]” Andrew Wilson and “denie[d] him necessary medical
assistance.”
Id., p. 19.
120. In this Memorandum, the City, through its lawyers, made the following admission
concerning it change of position from defending Burge for his alleged torture of Andrew Wilson
to asserting that said torture was so outrageous as to be outside the scope of Burge’s
employment: “The change in the City’s position was the result of inquiries undertaken by the
City in good faith and in the public interest.” Id. p. 12.
121. On July 30, 1992, almost two years after Superintendent Martin had first received
the Goldston findings, the Police Foundation submitted its report to Superintendent of Police
Matt Rodriguez. After noting that because “hangings, shockings, ‘baggings’ beatings, chokings,
and beatings were alleged to occur, many in the Area 2 Headquarters itself, a thorough and
rigorous investigation seemed required,” and that it passed no judgment as to whether the torture
alleged had in fact took place, the Report criticized Goldston’s methodology. Police Foundation 28
Report, “An Analysis of the Methods Employed in the Preparation of the Goldston Report,”
7/30/92.
122. The Police Foundation recommended, inter alia, that the Chicago Police
Department investigate or re-investigate cases of serious misconduct listed in the Goldston
Report, create a database concerning these investigations, rigorously and uniformly investigate
them, and create a monitoring system to identify patterns of serious police misconduct. Id.
123. Almost three years after first receiving the Goldston Report, OPS Director Shines
reopened the Cannon, Howard, Adkins, Craft, Holmes, White and Michael Johnson cases and
assigned OPS investigators to them. Numerous other serious Area 2 torture cases, including
those of Plaintiff, Leroy Orange, Melvin Jones, Anthony Homes, George Powell, and Madison
Hobley, were not opened or reopened. Shines’ Dep. in Santiago v. Marquez; CRs of named
Victims.
124. Leroy Orange testified on May 22,1985, at his trial that on January 12, 1984 he
was taken to Area 2 and interrogated. During this interrogation, he was handcuffed behind his
back to a circle in the wall, a plastic bag was put over his head, and when the bag was put over
his head a second time he was punched in the stomach. People v. Orange, 5/22/85, pp. 1112-14.
125. Leroy Orange further testified that he was shocked on the arm with an electrical
device, and that an officer stuck his hands between his legs and squeezed his testicles. Id. at
1114; Affidavits of Leroy Orange.
126. Leroy Orange averred in ¶¶ 11-13 of an affidavit that he was interviewed in the
summer of 1990 by a male OPS investigator at Pontiac Correctional Center, and after reviewing
a stack of photographs, he identified Jon Burge as one of the detectives involved in his torture. 29
127. OPS Investigator Michael Goldston listed Orange as a victim tortured by Burge in
his 1990 OPS report. Goldston Report.
128. Detectives McWeeny and Madigan testified at Orange’s trial that they were
partners and they arrested Orange on January 12, 1984, and they transported him to Area 2
Headquarters where they locked him in an interview room, and the next day they conducted lineups with him. People v. Orange, pp. 615-17, 624,1232-34.
129. Leroy Orange stated at his bond hearing on January 14, 1984 that he had pin marks
on his butt, that was the only visible bruise he had to show, and that “other things happened.”
People v. Orange, Kidd, 1/14/84, p. 3.
130. Orange’s co-defendant, Leonard Kidd, also stated at the January 14th bond hearing
that he was hurting between his legs where the police jumped on him, and his lawyer also noted
on the record that Kidd was limping and that he came in injured. Id.
131. On February 9, 1984, Orange’s attorney told a reporter for the Chicago Sun Times
that officers administered electrical shocks to Orange’s buttocks and anus with a “black box.”
“Cop ‘black box’ torture charged,” Chicago Sun Times, 2/9/84.
132. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,
on behalf of Chicago Superintendent Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted that:
In January of 1984, Leroy Orange was taken to Area II where he was interrogated and
tortured while Burge was in the room. Orange was shocked and jolted repeatedly with a
black box plugged into the wall. Orange’s pants were pulled down while electroshock
was applied to his body, including his buttocks. He was then asked if he was ready to
make a statement, and he replied that he was. Orange reported this torture to his
attorney, Earl Washington, who reported it to the media..
Memorandum In Opposition, January 22, 1992, p. 13.
133. In February of 1984, the OPS registered a complaint, number 136454, alleging that 30
Jon Burge and others who allegedly tortured Leroy Orange on January 12 and 13, 1984.
134. The OPS entered a not sustained finding on these allegations without ever taking a
statement from Orange, Burge or any other Area 2 detective or supervisor.
135. The Chicago Police Department has since destroyed the OPS file in complaint
number 136454.
136. On or about September 24, 1979, the OPS registered complaint number 108817
alleging that George Powell was beaten and suffocated with a bag while being questioned at
Area 2, the OPS entered a not sustained finding on these allegations without ever taking a
statement from Powell, Burge, or any other Area 2 detective or supervisor, and the Chicago
Police Department has since destroyed the OPS file in complaint number 108817.
137. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago
lawyers, on behalf of Superintendent Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted
that:
On September 20, 1979, George Powell was arrested at his girlfriend’s house and
taken to Area II where he was handcuffed to a wall. Burge brought in a long object with a
cord, similar to a cattle prod, and said he was go to do to Powell what he had done to
“Satan.” Burge shocked Powell on his stomach and chest, such that Powell almost passed
out. Also, while slapping ans questioning Powell, Burge put a bag over Powell’s head
and Powell had to bite a hole in it in order to breathe. Powell’s mother filed a complaint
with the office of Professional standards, who ultimately made a finding of not sustained.
Memorandum In Opposition, filed on January 22, 1992 in the Matter of Charges Filed against
Respondents Jon Burge, John Yucaitis and Patrick o’Hara, Cases # 1856-58, p. 9.

shocked, suffocated with a plastic bag, and beaten by Jon Burge and other Area 2 detectives
during his interrogation in September of 1999. 31
139. On May 11, 1989, Andrew Wilson's lawyers in Wilson’s civil rights trial filed
""Plaintiff's Proffer of Other Acts of Beating, Torture and Electroshock By Defendant Burge and
Other Detectives."" and served it on the City through counsel.

three separate times. Burge also applied the end of an electric shock device, housed in a
black box, to Holmes’ handcuffs, giving Holmes an intense shock, and causing him to
fall out of his chair and roll on the floor.
142. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,
on behalf of Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted:
On May 30, 1973, at approximately 4:00 a.m., Anthony Holmes, whose street name is
“Satan,” was taken to Area II headquarters where he was held, interrogated and tortured
for approximately six hours. Respondent Burge presided over his interrogation, during
which, in an effort to obtain a confession, plastic bags were placed over Holmes’ head,
causing him to pass out three times. Burge also applied the end of an electric shock
device, housed in a black box, to Holmes’ handcuffs, giving Holmes an intense shock,
which caused him to fall out of his chair and roll on the floor. The shock was extremely
painful and caused Holmes to press his jaws together and grit his teeth.

144. Neither the OPS nor the CPD opened an investigation into Anthony Holmes’
allegations in response Plaintiff Wilson’s Proffer, in response to the City’s statements in their
January 22, 1992 Memorandum, or at any other time. 32
145. Plaintiff’s Proffer also listed Lawrence Poree, stating:
Lawrence Poree was interrogated on two occasions in 1973 by Burge and Hoke. The
first time they showed him a wooden box, with no top and a generator inside with two
wires. Burge said “this is what we got for niggers like you.” Later (that year) Burge and
Hoke put Poree, while handcuffed, on a table and hit him. They then pulled his pants
down and applied electric shock to his arm, testicles and under his armpits.
146. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,
on behalf of Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted that:
Lawrence Poree will testify that on two occasions in 1973, he was interrogated by
respondent Burge and another detective. The first time they showed him a wooden box
with no top, a generator inside, and two wires. Burge then said, “this is what we’ve got
for niggers like you.” Later in 1973, Burge and [detective] Hoke put Poree, while
handcuffed, on a table and hit him. They then pulled his pants down and applied
electroshock to his arm and armpits, and to his testicles.
On August 7, 1979, Poree was arrested and brought to Area II where he was
interrogated by Burge. Poree was handcuffed in the interrogation room, and the black
box was on the table. Burge came in and said, “fun time again.” Poree was handcuffed
to the wall and hit in the head with a pistol. Apparently referring to Anthony Holmes,
Burge said “You can ask your fat friend about the box.” Burge shocked Poree eight or
nine times on the arms, chest, forehead, and back, causing him to clench his teeth and
bite his tongue and his mouth to bleed.

City Memorandum, or at any other time.
149. In U.S. ex. rel. Maxwell v. Gilmore, 1999 WL 130331 (N.D.Ill.) at *14; Judge
Shadur stated the following in his decision:
It is now common knowledge that in the early to mid-1980s Chicago Police Commander
Jon Burge and many officers working under him regularly engaged in the physical abuse 33
and torture of prisoners to extract confessions. Both internal police accounts and
numerous lawsuits and appeals brought by suspects alleging such abuse substantiate that
those beatings and other means of torture occurred as an established practice, not just on
an isolated basis.
150. At the May 13, 2003 oral argument in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in US
ex. rel. Leonard Hinton v. McArdory, Seventh Circuit Judge Diane Wood made the following statement
from the bench: “terrible things were happening in Area 2, things that should make us ashamed
of our police force and justice system.”
151. In Wilson v. City of Chicago, 120 F.3d 681, 683-85 (7th Cir. 1997), the Seventh
Circuit Court of Appeals held that Defendant Burge acted within the scope of his employment
with the City “when he tortured Wilson,” stating:
Burge was not pursuing a frolic of his own. He was enforcing the criminal law of Illinois
overzealously by extracting confessions from criminal suspects by improper means. He
was, as it were, too loyal an employee. He was acting squarely within the scope of his
employment.
152. OPS investigator Veronica [Tillman] Messenger was assigned to investigate the reopened Darrel Cannon OPS complaint (CR #134723) in May, 1993. CR # 134723, TillmanMessenger Testimony, People v. Cannon.

as saying that he was “‘inclined to believe’ Cannon’s claim that detectives working under
former police Cmdr John Burge extracted a confession from Cannon through torture” and that
“personally, I was inclined to believe there was torture.” Chicago Tribune, September 10,
2004.
159. After Darrell Cannon presented evidence that he was tortured to the Illinois
Prisoner Review Board on August 27, 2004 and September 3, 2004, Board Chairman Jorge

upstairs. Burge entered the room and told Mumin to get up and turn around to the wall.
Mumin was then handcuffed behind him to a ring or hook on the wall such that he could
not sit down. Burge told Mumin that he wanted to know about the robbery, and Mumin
replied that he had no knowledge of what burge was talking about. Burge told Mumin
he would talk before Mumin left left there and tightened Mumin’s handcuffs. The
handcuffs were painful and cut off Mumin’s circulation. Burge then left the room.
Burge returned after a half hour and loosened the handcuffs, asking Mumin if he
was ready to talk. When Mumin said he didn’t know what Burge was talking about,
Burge became angry and pushed him into a wall. He then removed Mumin’s handcuffs,
took him to an office down the hall and handcuffed him. Burge said, “You’re not going
to talk, huh?” and Mumin replied that he didn’t know what Burge was talking about.
Burge said, “do you know that we can bury you in the penitentiary?” Mumin replied
that he still didn’t know what Burge was talking about.
Burge then told Mumin that they really wanted his son, and Mumin repeated that
he didn’t know what Burge was talking about. Burge became angry and pulled out a
fully loaded .44 Magnum. He took out all the bullets except for one, spun it, placed it at 42
Mumin’s head and snapped it three times slowly. Burge told Mumin he was “damned
lucky” that Burge didn’t kill him and that he wanted to know about the “fucking
robbery.”
Burge became angry, jumped up from the desk and snatched a brownish plastic
typewriter cover. He said, “you’ll fucking talk or I’ll kill you,” and placed the cover
over his head. Burge held the cover over his head and pushed it down in his face so he
couldn’t breathe. Mumin, who was handcuffed behind his back, passed out. Burge put it
on his head three times. The third time, Mumin hollered and Burge took the cover off
and laughed. Burge asked him if he was ready to sign a statement and mumin told him
he would do anything. Burge told Mumin that if he told anybody, nobody would believe
him because there were no marks on him and that he had better sign the statement.

219. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago
lawyers, on behalf of Superintendent Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted:
On the evening of February 12, 1982, two days before Andrew Wilson’s arrest, Donald
White was picked up by police officers and taken to 11th and State. He was taken to a
room on the 5th floor by Hill, McKenna, Katalinic and respondent O’Hara, and they
began asking him who killed the police officers. They continued to ask him and White
repeatedly told them that he did not shoot the officers. Hill got mad and said “I am tired
of this fucking shit.” He took a black garbage bag and put it over White’s head and then
someone began beating him on his head. Although he could not see them with the bag
over his head, there had to have been at least four people hitting him. O’Hara was in
the room, as was Burge at various times. When White still stated that he did not shoot
the officers and did not know anything, they put the bag back over his head two more
times and beat him again. White almost lost consiousness. At one point, someone
stuck a gun in his mouth. White then said he would tell them anything they wanted to
know. Hill then asked him questions, and, when White didn’t have it right, Hill
pretended he was going to hit White.
White testified to these facts in a deposition taken in connection with Andrew
Wilson’s civil trial. White had not told anyone for five years that he had been abused
because he feared for his life at the hands of the police officers. When he finally agreed
to testify about the abuse he suffered, he did so only on the condition that
Wilson’s lawyers would move him out of Illinois. In addition, because he was
afraid and did not know who he could trust, he did not file an OPS complaint. His
mother, however, did file an OPS complaint in connection with his torture at the hands
of the police officers. OPS reached a finding of “not sustained.” 48

Burge during the investigation. A now retired Area Two detective who took part in the
dragnet told the Reader that ""there were a million volunteers....Normally you'd have 15 to
20 violent crimes guys on duty. Now you've got not only them, you've got the property
crimes guys, the gang crimes guys. Detectives from Area One were there. The brass was
there because it was such a heater case....My partner and I worked 36 hours straight.
Burge had to send someone to his house to get clean socks and a shirt. He didn't go
home."" The detective said, ""It was a reign of terror. I don't know what Kristallnacht was
like, but this was probably close."" Complaints were widespread, with Jesse Jackson
saying that the community was living ""under military occupation.""

339. In her statement, Pryweller averred that during this conversation, Burge and
Dwyer described how they dealt with “niggers” during interrogations, stating that they “give

Robert Kirschner testified as an expert that he was a forensic pathologist, a member of the
Human Rights Program at the University of Chicago, a forensic consultant to physicians for
human rights, that he had participated in several missions and investigations around the world
investigating police and other governmental torture, that over the past 15 years he has evaluated
approximately 200 torture victims around the world, and that he has often been called on to
evaluate whether there is systematic torture being practiced by the police and other
governmental authorities. Kirschner further testified that he has done much of his work on
behalf of the United Nations, for whom he has written portions of a protocol which defines the
methodologies of torture and how to properly investigate and evaluate cases of alleged torture.

used across the world. Id. at 5-6, 10-45, 57-59, 69, 80-81, 90-93, 96.
346. Dr. Kirschner further testified that in his opinion there was a pattern and practice
of torture at Area 2 and later at Area 3 Headquarters under the command of Jon Burge, and that
this opinion was based, inter alia, on his evaluations of several alleged Area 2 and 3 torture 71
victims, including Andrew Wilson, Darrell Cannon, Leroy Orange and Marcus Wiggins,
discussions with Chicago detectives who acknowledged that there was police torture at Area 2,
the fact that frequent allegations of electric shock, bagging, Russian Roulette only arose from
Area 2 and later from Area 3 Headquarters while Jon Burge was the commander, and not
against other officers in other station houses, and that the patterns and methodologies at Area 2
and 3 under Burge and Byrne closely mirrored those which he observed, investigated, and
evaluated in places such as Turkey and Israel. Id. at 5-6, 10-45, 57-59, 69, 80-81, 90-93, 96.
347. In an affidavit executed in August of 2004, Richard Brzeczek averred that he was
the Chicago Police Superintendent from January 11, 1980 until April 29,1983. Affidavit of
Richard Brzeczek, ¶1.
348. Brzeczek further averred that he made the following true and accurate statements
to Chicago Tribune reporter Steve Mills which appeared in an April 29 2002 Chicago Tribune
article:
Twenty years later, Brzeczek, now a defense attorney, said that there is ‘no doubt in my
mind’ that Burge and his detectives tortured some suspects. The whole situation at Area 2
[was] a disgrace and an embarrassment. It’s time something is done about it,” Brzeczek
said, referring to the former Burnside station on the southside where most of the torture
allegedly occurred.
Id., ¶¶ 4-5.
349. Brzeczek further averred that “subsequent to [his] resignation from the Chicago
Police Department, [he] monitored litigation initiated by persons making claims and/or
allegations regarding torture sustained at the hands of police officers at Detective Division Area
2. [He] further monitored the prosecution of certain police officers previously assigned to Area 2
based on allegations of torture and other improper treatment of prisoners under their control 72
before the Chicago police Board. [He] also monitored media coverage of allegations and legal
actions arising out of allegations of torture and other improper treatment brought by persons
against police officers assigned to Detective Division Area 2.” Id., ¶ 10.
350. Brzeczek further averred that “based on the fact that allegations continued to arise
alleging torture and other improper treatment occurring at a time after [he] left the Chicago
Police Department on April 29, 1983, and based upon the fact that Richard M. Daley, State’s
Attorney of Cook County, did not conduct (or at least affiant is not aware of any such action),
any investigation into the allegations brought to his attention by the affiant in the letter as
aforesaid, affiant was and is convinced that some persons held in custody at Area 2 had to be
tortured.” Id., ¶11.
351. In his affidavit, Brzeczek further averred that “based on the sheer number of the
allegations, the findings of the courts in certain litigation brought against officers assigned to the
Detective Division Area 2, and the fact that police officers were discharged and/or suspended for
their roles in allegations made against them for the improper treatment of prisoners while
assigned to Detective Division Area 2, the affiant was and is convinced that some persons were
tortured while in custody at Detective Division Area 2.” Id., ¶12.

Police Department?
A: In all professions.
Q: Okay. And its, do you acknowledge - - -
A: Including, including the Chicago Police Department.
City Council Hearing, Committee on Police, Fire an Municipal Institutions, Public
Hearing on Police Brutality, Day 5, October 11, 1989, p. 285.

agree or - - -
A: Yes.
Q: Do you agree that there is in fact in force and functioning a code of silence
among police officers?
A: To some extent, yes, sir.

358. On or about October 19, 1987, OPS Director Fogel sent a document entitled
“Proposed Revamping of Office of Professional Standards,” to the Mayor of the City of Chicago
in which he wrote:
By accepting all cases, even erring on the liberal side, to be accommodative to the
public, OPS gives the appearance of moving forward on all complaints. The opposite
occurs. The appearance of doing a thorough investigation with full due process
and endless unnecessary reviews for all, actually operates to immunize police
from internal discipline, increases their overtime, leads to an enormous “paper storm”
and has institutionalized lying.
“Proposed Revamping of Office of Professional Standards,” October 19, 1987, p. 2.

360. In Jones v. City of Chicago, 856 F. 2d 985, (7th Cir. 1987) the Seventh Circuit 76
Court of Appeals affirmed a jury verdict against Area 2 Violent Crimes detectives, supervisors
and commanding officers, including detectives James Houtsma, Dennis McGuire, John McCabe,
and Raymond McNally, Sgt. Alvin Palmer, Lt. Griffith, and Commander Milton Deas, for
conspiracy to “railroad” 18 year old George Jones for a 1981 murder, stating:
We cannot say that the jury acted unreasonably in finding that all of the
individual defendants were voluntary participants in a common venture to
railroad George Jones.
Jones v. City of Chicago, 856 F. 2d at 992.
361. In Jones v. City of Chicago, the Seventh Circuit affirmed a jury verdict against the
City of Chicago for maintaining a “street files”custom or policy which led to the railroading of
18 year old George Jones for a 1981 murder, stating:
The custom in question is the maintenance of the ""street files,"" police
files withheld from the state's attorney and therefore unavailable as a
source of exculpatory information that might induce him not to prosecute
or, failing that, would at least be available to defense counsel under
Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215, 83 S. Ct. 1194 (1963). As
we noted recently, information undermining the credibility of a government
witness is within the scope of Brady's rule. See United States v.
Herrera-Medina, 853 F.2d 564, slip op. at 5 (7th Cir. 1988).
Although the lawfulness of the street-files practice has never been
adjudicated, the City, which has abandoned the practice, does not challenge
the jury's implicit finding that it denied criminal defendants due process
of law. Brady v. Maryland does not require the police to keep written
records of all their investigatory activities; but attempts to circumvent
the rule of that case by retaining records in clandestine files
deliberately concealed from prosecutors and defense counsel cannot be
tolerated. The City sensibly does not attempt to defend such behavior in
this court.
There is little doubt that the clandestine character of the street files
played a role in Jones's misfortunes. Cf. Harris v. City of Pagedale, 821
F.2d 499, 507 (8th Cir. 1987). If the state's attorney had had [*996]
access to them, he would have discovered memos by Kelly and especially by
Laverty that would have given any prosecutor pause. Alternatively, defense 77
counsel would have obtained them prior to trial and the trial would have
ended even sooner than it did. The only question is whether this custom was
a custom of the City of Chicago. As the custom was department-wide
and of long standing, the jury was entitled to conclude that it had been
consciously approved at the highest policy-making level for decisions
involving the police department -- the standard suggested by the recent
plurality opinion in City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U.S. 112, 108 S.
Ct. 915, 99 L. Ed. 2d 107 (1988). See also Stokes v. Bullins, 844 F.2d 269,
273 (5th Cir. 1988).
Jones, 856 F. 2d at 995.

Defendant Burge and Other Detectives,"" filed on May 11, 1989 and served on the City of
Chicago by Andrew Wilson's lawyers in Wilson’s civil rights trial set forth that:
Edward James and James Lewis were arrested in Memphis, Tennessee by Burge
and Area 2 detective Wagner. Burge said “wait until we get you back to the
horror chamber. We know how to squeeze a man’s nuts.” When they returned to
Chicago, Burge asked if the man on duty was the one who killed Fred Hampton
and Mark Clark. Burge said “when we get through with you you’ll be glad to tell
us what we want.”
Area 2 Burge presided over the interrogation of Lewis and James in separate
rooms. Burge laughed when each asked for an attorney saying “you know better
than that.’ Lewis was hit in the throat and slapped in the side of the head, injuring
his eardrum. When James refused to talk, he was struck in the mouth by Burge
and punched in the neck. James was told he was “gonna talk before 12:00.”

interrogations, and abuse in their testimony at their motion to suppress hearing in March of
1980. People v. James and Lewis, 3/10/80.

Howard Collins was arrested by Burge and then detective, now commander, Hoke. They
drove him around in their police vehicle, pointed their guns at him and then pulled the
triggers, but the chambers were empty. He was taken to Area II where he was
interrogated and beaten by Burge and Hoke for one and one half hours, during which time they
put a rope around his neck in a noose-like fashion, and injured his throat. When
Reverend Daniel, a police Board member, came to Area II to inquire about Collins, he was
released. An OPS complaint was subsequently filed.

575. From 1972 to the present, the only police department discipline which has been
imposed against any Area 2 or Area 3 detective, supervisor, or command officer for any
allegations of torture or physical abuse made against them has been the firing of Jon Burge and

576. From 1972 to the present, the City of Chicago and its Police Department has
conducted no criminal investigations into any of the allegations of torture or other physical abuse
made against Area 2 and Area 3 detectives and supervisors, including, but not limited to, the
alleged victims named above.
577. From 1972 to the present, the City of Chicago and its Police Department has not

allegations of torture or other physical abuse, including, but not limited to, those made by the
alleged victims named above.

Brutality Claims,” Chicago Tribune, May 21, 2003.
583. On March 3, 1998, upon becoming Police Superintendent, Terry Hillard told the
Chicago Sun Times that “barring new evidence, it's time to close the book on the Burge era and
move on.” Hillard Dep., Santiago v. Marquez, 5/3/99, pp. 32-33, 35-36, 43-46
584. In an August 31, 1998 memo from the office of the Superintendent , Thomas
Needham, General Counsel to the Superintendent, to Leonard Benefico, Office of Professional
Standards, Needham listed the following cases:
Darrell Cannon CR#134723
Stanley Howard CR# 142017
Gregory Banks CR# 188617
Lee Holmes CR# 126802
Philip Adkins CR# 142201
Donald White CR# 169867
Lavert Jones CR# 200390
Stanley Ware CR# 202019 112
Michael Johnson CR# 125071
and wrote that “you are hereby instructed to classify all of the allegations in the above
referenced complaint register files as ‘not sustained.’” August 31, 1998 memo from Thomas
Needham, General Counsel to the Superintendent, to Leonard Benefico, Office of Professional
Standards.
585. As a basis for this unprecedented order, Needham cited the age of the cases and the
purported lack of “new evidence,” when, in fact, a wealth of new evidence had been developed
by the OPS investigators in almost all of the cases. Id.; CR files of listed cases; Testimony of
OPS investigators at People v. Cannon Hearing.
586. Superintendent Hillard, after talking to Neeedham about his decision, ratified his
actions in “not sustaining’” these cases, stating, under oath, that “I support Tom Needham 100
percent when it comes down to representing me in this department in hard cases like that.”
Hillard Dep., Santiago v. Marquez, 5/3/99, pp. 32-33, 35-36.
587. In a letter dated August 2, 1999, from Citizens Alert, addressed to Superintendent
Terry Hillard, OPS Director Callie Baird and Police Board President Demitrius Carney, the
signators wrote:
We write as a group of public officials, citizens and organizations concerned with
police violence and discipline to urge you to immediately reopen and review several
Office of Professional Standards (OPS) investigations into police torture, and to open
investigations in numerous other torture cases where no OPS investigations have been
conducted. We further urge you to commission an independent investigation into the
obvious violations of police regulations and procedure and legal process by certain OPS
and police officials during the torture investigations which were conducted by the OPS.
August 2, 1999 Letter from Citizens Alert, Mary Powers et. al. to Hillard, Carney, and Baird.
588. In the August 2, 1999 letter, the signators further wrote: 113
Recent news articles and publicly released documents and depositions reveal that the
OPS reopened nine torture investigations in 1992 and 1993 as a result of prior OPS
findings that physical abuse of African American suspects at Area 2 from 1973 to 1986
included ""psychological techniques and planned torture,"" was ""systematic,"" and
""methodical,"" and that Area 2 command members, particularly Jon Burge, ""were aware
of the systematic abuse and perpetuated it either by actively participating in same or
failing to take any action to bring it to an end."" Goldston Report, pp 2-3. The now public
evidence further reveals that OPS investigators Tillman, Lawrence, and Cosey conducted
thorough investigations in each of these cases, discovered new evidence not available
during the initial investigations, and sustained findings in six of the cases. The sustained
findings included findings that victims were electric shocked, suffocated with a plastic
bag, suspended in air by their handcuffs, beaten and stomped, and racially abused. The
evidence further shows that these sustained findings were entered against several police
officers who were and are still Chicago police officers in good standing, most notably
Lieutenant Peter Dignan, who had allegations of torture and abuse sustained against him
in five of the six cases. The evidence further reveals that these findings and the
investigative files were tendered to OPS Director Gayle Shines in 1994 for her review,
and that she overturned the findings in four of the cases in late 1994 and early 1995, at
the same time that Peter Dignan was nominated by the Mayor and the Department for
merit promotion to Lieutenant. Ms. Shines has admitted that in the approximately 2500
sustained cases which she reviewed during her eight year career as Director, she
overturned a total of 10 cases, including these four against Dignan.
The evidence further shows that in the other two cases, Darrell Cannon and Stanley
Howard, Ms. Shines never completed her review of the sustained findings of torture, but
rather kept these files in her office for four years, together with the other seven files.
Cannon, who was on trial in a murder case, and Howard, who is on death row, sought
these files by subpoena, but Shines and the Department failed to produce these files,
which contained highly exculpatory evidence. Furthermore, after Ms. Shines left the OPS
in 1998, counsel to the Superintendent, Thomas Needham, obtained the nine torture files
from the OPS and, without consultation with the Superintendent, summarily reversed the
sustained findings and closed the cases. Needham, who, as a longtime assistant state’s
attorney, was closely connected to the prosecution of several torture victims, including
Cannon, admitted that his summary reversals of the torture findings were not based on
the merits of the cases, but rather on the fact that the files had languished in Shines’
office for so long a period of time. The Superintendent never reviewed these cases on the
merits as he is required by police procedure to do, and he only learned of his counsel’s
unjustifiable actions by reading about them in a February 1999 Chicago Tribune article.
Additionally, the public evidence reveals that the OPS failed to investigate numerous
additional documented cases of police torture against African American suspects. In the
case of Melvin Jones, Mary Powers of Citizen’s Alert specifically requested by a letter
dated July 26, 1989 that the OPS open an investigation into the recently revealed
allegations that Jones was electric shocked at by Jon Burge and several other Area 2
detectives who remain on the force to this day. Contrary to police and OPS procedure, no
investigation was ever opened, despite the fact that the City has subsequently admitted in 114
official court papers that Jones was in fact tortured. Similarly, in the Shadeed Mumin
case, an investigation was opened and OPS investigators developed compelling new
evidence that he was tortured by Burge and an unidentified detective. Just as the OPS
investigator was about to identify this officer, the OPS discontinued the investigation,
supposedly because the investigation had not been assigned a complaint register number.
In numerous other cases, including Aaron Patterson and nine other men who are
presently on death row as a result of confessions which they allege were tortured from
them, the OPS has failed to conduct any investigation whatsoever into these most serious
allegations.
Id.
589. In the August 2, 1999 letter, the signators made the following demands:
1. Given Ms. Shines’ clear misconduct, lack of objectivity, and failure to complete her
review of the Cannon and Howard sustained findings, that new OPS Director, Callie
Baird, conduct an independent review on the merits of the six sustained torture
cases;
2. If Ms. Baird concurs with one or more of the sustained findings, that the
Superintendent fully and fairly review those findings on the merits, as he is required by
police procedure to do;
3. That counsel Thomas Needham be disqualified from any role in reviewing or
otherwise participating in any torture investigations;
4. That Peter Dignan and any other active officers against whom torture findings were
entered by OPS investigators be suspended pending complete review;
5. That the department and its OPS open an investigation into the allegations that Melvin
Jones was electric shocked by Jon Burge and other still active detectives and consider
in making its findings that the City has admitted that Jones was in fact tortured;
6. That the Department and its OPS reopen and complete the Shadeed Mumin
investigation;
7. That the Department and its OPS open investigations into the other numerous
documented cases of police torture, as listed in the Appendix attached hereto,
including those allegations made by men on death row;
8. That the Department commission an independent investigation into the serious
violations of departmental rules and court process by high ranking police and OPS
officials, including Thomas Needham and Gayle Shines;
9. That the Department and the OPS Director meet with representatives from the
undersigned groups and discuss these proposals and to periodically report on the
progress of these investigations;
10.That these investigations and findings be subject to public scrutiny.

592. Superintendent Hillard subsequently met with representatives from the signators of
the August 2, 1999 Citizens Alert letter.
593. Other than Hillard’s meeting with representatives from the signators of the August
2, 1999 Citizens Alert letter, no action was taken on any of the demands made in the letter. 116
594. In an e mail dated 1/10/02, Corporation Counsel Mara S. Georges wrote to her
assistant: “Sheila O’Grady would like us to explore bringing an action against Burge. Will you
please think about it and give us your thoughts?” “New documents Report that City Considered
Suing Burge, City continues Paying For Fired Commander’s Legal Defense,” NBC 5.com.,
4/29/04.
595. On January 1, 2002, Sheila O’Grady was Mayor Daley’s Chief of Staff. Id.
596. In response, Jeffrey Given, Georges’ assistant, wrote that suing Burge “would
seem to undercut our ability to defend [against the inmates’] suit by challenging the underlying
facts . . .” “City Considered Suing Burge; Officials Weighed Their Options to Fight Growing
Uproar over Torture Allegations Against the Fired Police Commander,” Chicago Tribune,
4/29/04.
597. Mindful that the torture allegations were gaining new momentum, Given and
Georges also considered mounting a public relations campaign to counter continuing negative
publicity about Burge and the City’s role in the torture scandal. Id.
598. Given and Georges recognized that the campaign would not be easy for a wide
variety of reasons, including that some of Burge’s men were still on the police force, the
department had been embarrassed by Needham’s unilateral shelving of the OPS torture
investigations despite the investigators’ sustained findings, and that the Tribune’s then recent
series on the continuing CPD practice of obtaining false confessions had again focused attention
on the issue, and Given further stated “but query how we’ll do in the court of public opinion
after a long, public, expensive and embarrassing discovery process?” NBC5.com; Chicago
Tribune.
599. Instead of suing Burge, or otherwise distancing the City from him, the City decided 117
to invest unlimited public funds in representing Burge and at least thirty-five other Area 2
detectives accused of torture and abuse in the four torture cases and to fight production and
public disclosure of additional documents that would further expose the City’s central role in the
torture scandal in civil and criminal cases and with the Special Prosecutor. Id.
600. On August 27, 2004 in his sworn testimony before the Prisoner Review Board,
former Area 2 Commander and Superintendent Leroy Martin falsely denied that he did not have
contemporaneous knowledge of the allegations of torture and abuse against Jon Burge and other
Area 2 detectives while he was Commander. Tr. of 8/27/04 Parole Revocation Hearing of Darrell
Cannon.
601. In her concurring opinion in Hinton v. Uchtman (sub. nom.)___F 3d ___ (7th Cir.
2005), Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Diane Wood found:
[T]he claim Hinton has made regarding his confession illustrates dramatically the
high price our system of criminal justice pays when police abuse runs rampant: a
cloud hangs over everything that the bad actors touched . . . [A] mountain of
evidence indicates that torture was an ordinary occurrence at the Area Two station
of the Chicago Police Department during the exact time period pertinent to
Hinton's case. Eventually, as this sorry tale came to light, the Office of
Professional Standards Investigation of the Police Department looked into the
allegations, and it issued a report that concluded that police torture under the
command of Lt. Jon Burge — the officer in charge of Hinton's case — had been a
regular part of the system for more than ten years. And, in language reminiscent
of the news reports of 2004 concerning the notorious Abu Ghraib facility in Iraq,
the report said that ""[t]he type of abuse described was not limited to the usual
beating, but went into such esoteric areas as psychological techniques and
planned torture."" The report detailed specific cases, such as the case of Andrew
Wilson, who was taken to Area Two on February 14, 1982. There a group led by
Burge beat Wilson, stuffed a bag over his head, handcuffed him to a radiator, and
repeatedly administered electric shocks to his ears, nose, and genitals. See People
v. Wilson, 506 N.E.2d 571 (Ill. 1987). Burge eventually lost his job with the
police, though not until 1992. See In the Matter of the Charges Filed Against Jon
Burge, No. 91-1856 (Chicago Police Board, February 11, 1993). To this day,
Burge has not been prosecuted for any of these actions, though it appears that he
at least thinks that he may still be at some risk of prosecution. See, for example, 118
""Cop brutality probe must be thorough, fair,"" Chi. Sun-Times, May 16, 2002
(editorial); Hal Dardick, ""Burge repeatedly takes 5th; Former police commander
stays mum on torture questions,"" Chi. Tribune, Sept. 2, 2004 (noting allegations
that Burge or people reporting to him had tortured 108 Black and Latino suspects
between August 1972 and September 1991). . . .
Behavior like that attributed to Burge imposes a huge cost on society: it
creates distrust of the police generally, despite the fact that most police officers
would abhor such tactics, and it creates a cloud over even the valid convictions in
which the problem officer played a role. Indeed, the alleged conduct is so
extreme that, if proven, it would fall within the prohibitions established by the
United Nations Convention Against Torture (""CAT""), which defines torture as
""any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is
intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a
third person information or a confession . . .,"" thereby violating the fundamental
human rights principles that the United States is committed to uphold. . . .",[],0,University of Chicago,Terry McDermott,2012,[70],1,Let It Be - The Voice Performance,https://open.spotify.com/track/2fWICX9qjREvP8caDxrJMz,2fWICX9qjREvP8caDxrJMz,spotify:track:2fWICX9qjREvP8caDxrJMz,The Complete Season 3 Collection (The Voice Performance),7lYOddO9UUTeM3IWd3Q5oD,spotify:album:7lYOddO9UUTeM3IWd3Q5oD,Terry McDermott,70vDOyUxrgVhYM63LkJfvV,spotify:artist:70vDOyUxrgVhYM63LkJfvV,234.52,12.0,19.0,2012-01-01,0.475,0.597,0.0,-6.2989999999999995,1.0,0.0305,0.0114,0.0,0.19899999999999998,0.39799999999999996,142.024,['deep talent show'],[],

She rolled in
My little sandy town
She spent the summer there
A couple houses down
Well it was magic in the air
When she caught my eye
We shared three short months
And one long goodbye

[Chorus]
She was the one that got away
The one that wrecked my heart
I should've never let her go
I should've begged her to stay

Well she kissed my lips
Down on Ocean Drive

Wishing I could hold her

I been hanging round this place, I been looking through your space
I been waiting' for you, I've been waiting' for you
All the places that you go, all the people that you know
I've been looking for you, I've been looking for you

[Verse 2]
And all these pretty people up on El Cerrito Place
They all got something in their pockets, all got something on their face
They roll down to La Brea where it meets the boulevard
Singing' hallelujah while they dance over the stars
They all say they're going' far

[Chorus]
Me I've been looking for you baby, I've been looking for you baby
I've been looking for you baby, I've been looking for you baby
All night long, all night long, all night long

[Verse 3]
Someone said they might have seen you where the ocean meets the land
So I've been out here all night looking for your footprints in the sand
Did you hear the ocean singing, baby did you sing along
While you danced out in the water to some ol' forgotten song
Were you even here at all?

[Chorus]
Me I've been looking for you baby, I've been looking for you baby
I've been looking for you baby, I've been looking for you baby
All night long, all night long, all night long

[Verse 4]
Somehow I wound up in the desert just after daylight
Where the Joshua Trees grow that little place you always liked
These pioneer town people ain't got too much to say
And if you ever were here baby they ain't giving' you away

[Verse 5]
Now it's been two days
I'm still looking for you baby, I've been looking for you baby
I've been looking for you baby, I've been looking for you baby
All night long, all night long, all night long

Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels, but I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song but I do, I do
Walked in, expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is, but I do

[Chorus]
And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again

[Verse 2]
You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you, but I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy, but I do

[Chorus]
But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again

[Bridge]
And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk
About the movies that your family watches
Every single Christmas, and I will talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past

[Chorus]
'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did

73,73,Diced Pineapples,"[Intro: Wale]
Diced pineapple
Tonight you shall reach a height that the sky won't catch you
The highest form of my admiration
I ain't no connoisseur but I'm, kinda sure you will admire my taste
And before the sun graze ya, I'm tryin to see how deep you are
And believe me shorty I ain't talking 'bout no intimate conversation
I wanna see if I can make you reach things unobtainable
When I peek into your nature
And I promise you my goals will exceed any physical pleasure
I wanna, give you what's better than better
The better my effort, the wetter her treasure
The more these mere moments seem like heavens or, temporary forevers
Shorty get it together, hah, diced pineapple
May your love come down so my mind might have you
You designed my imagination
Let me redefine foreplay 'til you need five and
Tell me shorty you got it baby
If it's not it baby, hope it's progress baby
Let it all drip baby
If you stop that shaking, no more talking baby
No more talking baby

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Shorty so fine, pussy so fresh
Diced pineapples, damn, my baby tastes the best
I nearly lost my mind, guess it was a test
Swept her off her feet and went and bought her ass a Lex
Paid it off cash so I never wrote a check
Leave my cars at her crib, I'm just stuntin' on her ex
Pussy's excellent and I know it sound a mess
I love to make her toes curl as I'm lickin' on her flesh (ugh)
Sex all night, couple shots of CÎROC
Crib on the water, got LeBron up the block
Money ain't the thing, baby, welcome to the mob
Diced pineapples, talking diamonds by the jar
Bitch so bad got me wishing I could sing
Her uniform Isabel Marant when you on the team
Double MG, them other niggas fell off
Baby girl, I just wanna see you well off

[Chorus: Drake]
Call me crazy, shit at least you’re calling
Feels better when you let it out, don't it girl?
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right, aww yeah

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Shorty so fine, pussy so fresh
Diced pineapples, I just bought my girl a set
I know my lifestyle wild, I do it for the set
She know how to make me smile and she do it with the sex
Pop bottles, make love, Thug Passion
Red bottoms, Moncler, high fashion
Belt buckles, door handles, gold plated
Balmain, rich denim, out Vegas
French Riviera, baby girl lets take a trip
I'ma trip go to Cannes, France to catch a flick
Baby listen, this position is a blessing
And with your permission, hopefully you'll learn a lesson (ugh)
I'm so fly that I shouldn't even walk
She so fine she ain't even gotta talk
Diced pineapples, talking diamonds by the jar
She never wrote a song but I know that she's a star

[Chorus: Drake]
Call me crazy, shit at least you’re calling
Feels better when you let it out, don't it girl?
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right, aww yeah

[Verse 3: Wale]
Something about her, probably can't live without her
Roll up some sour, let me kiss on her fountain
Mission accomplished, you increasing your heart rate
And I won't ever rest, we meet at the peak of your mountain
Eager to show you, thinking that I should know you
And you eager to work perfect, I can employ you
Designer shit spoil you, rub you down with the oil
To get on a higher tree, gonna have to climb a sequoia
Hol' up, showing off some Agent Provocateur
Rushing you out your drawers though patiently get you off
Hate when they be too anxious though, hate when they be too dull
Like to go deep but I hate to get too deeply involved
How sweet is you? (sweet is you?) Let me see some proof
Fuck making pussy talk, I like to make it sing a tune
All we need is we, we don’t need no room
Right now I’m trying to eat, and we don’t need a spoon

[Chorus: Drake]
Call me crazy, shit at least you’re calling
Feels better when you let it out, don't it girl?
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right

74,74,Poetic Justice,"[Produced by Scoop DeVille & Sounwave]

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Every second, every minute, man I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch put your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood
I'm talking 'bout dark room, perfume, go, go

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I recognize your fragrance, hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit, uh
And I know your taste is, a little bit hmm, high maintenance, uh
Everybody else basic, you live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em? I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off, fuck that
Pour up plenty of champagne, cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and y'all curled in that little bitty Range I heard that
She wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga don't approach her with that Atari, nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs 'less I write it down for real, P.S

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song

[Verse 2: Drake]
I really hope you play this, cause ol' girl you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one off vacations
You've been taking clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
Young East African Girl, you too busy fucking with your other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your momma to the motherland, I could do it
Maybe one day when you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's all right here in the city and you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life but Goddamn you got adjusted
I mean I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin, and your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doing that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
And they say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write 'em down for real, P.S

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Every time I write these words, they become a taboo
Making sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talking poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
It's you looking in the mirror, love is not just a verb
It's you looking for it, maybe, call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common and what we have common is pain
I mean you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steering, sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it, uh-huh
That's your heartbeat, it either caught me or it called me, uh-huh
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly and right before you go blind, P.S

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song

""Yo I don't care who this nigga over here for, if he don't tell where he come, it's a wrap! I'm sorry""
""Hol' up hol' up hol' up, we gon' do it like this, OK? I'mma tell you where I'm from, OK? You gon' tell me where you from, OK? Or where your Grandma stay, where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, OK?""

76,76,One Of Those Nights,"[Verse 1]
She's getting dressed up, putting on that lipstick
Shimmy shakeing, right into them cutoffs baby, oh yeah
You're getting off work, cashing out that paycheck
Gotta change that shirt and pick that girl up on her front step
Here she comes now lookin' so fine
You've been waiting on this night for such a long, long time

[Verse 2]
She slides in and you roll down Main Street
You turn right when that red light turns green
Sun sets now, you're half way to heaven
She picks a song, you turn it up to 11
You say, ""Do you wanna?"" and she says, ""Hell, yeah""
So you hit the party, all your buddies are jealous
Someday you'll be looking back on your life
At the memories, this is gonna be one of those nights

[Verse 3]
Crowded backyard, everybody's laughin'
Kinda party, next week you'll say I was there when it happened
Coming up on midnight, 'bout time to get gone
And then the DJ starts to play your favorite song
You slow dance for 3 minutes or so, and then she whispers, ""Baby, let's go.""

[Verse 4]
And when she slides in and she gives you the green light
You hold off 'till you turn on the headlights
Someday when you're looking back on your life
At the memories, this is gonna be one of those nights
Yeah, one of those nights

[Bridge]
Full moon through a crack in the windshield
You hold her close and you'll never forget how her heartbeat feels
No, you never will
'Cause someday when you're looking back on your life
At the memories, this is gonna be one of those nights

Yeah, one of those nights
One of those nights

77,77,Rest Of My Life,"[Intro: Usher]
If you live for somethin', you're not alone my friend
So fill up your cup and lift your lighter, a toast to life

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
They say what don't kill me can make me stronger
So two drinks a night should help me live longer
I blow some smoke just to give my lungs a test
'Cause why tip-toe through life to arrive safely at death?
I'm on a journey, yeah I'm on a roll
Sometimes gotta close my eyes just to open my soul
And tonight is the night I got a feeling that I'm about to act a fool
So if you go fix some drinks me and Usher about to break some rules

[Hook: Usher]
That's somewhere to go, but the world is movin' slow
I was born for the fast life
I go for broke, a lesson I can't afford
But for what it's worth I'm ready to pay
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
Oh, oh, oh

[Break: Usher]
Na na, hey, oh
Na na, hey, oh
Na na, hey, oh
Na na, hey
For the rest of my life

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
If I got one life to live, I'ma party 'til I'm dead
What the hell is a life worth livin' if it's not on the edge?
Tryna keep my balance, I'm twisted so just in case I fall
Written on my tombstone should say ""Women, Weed, and Alcohol""

[Hook: Usher]
That's somewhere to go, but the world is movin' slow
I was born for the fast life
I go for broke, a lesson I can't afford
But for what it's worth I'm ready to pay
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
Oh, oh, oh

Na na, hey, oh
Na na, hey

[Interlude: Usher]
If you live for somethin', you're not alone my friend
So fill up your cup, lift your lighters, a toast to life

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
I'm stuck in this moment, freeze the hands of time
Cause I feel inner peace when I'm out of my mind
And you can call me crazy, but I like to roll the dice
So I'm willin' to bet that I'ma be crazy for the rest of...

78,78,Stubborn Love,"[Verse 1]
She'll lie and steal and cheat
And beg you from her knees
Make you think she means it this time
She'll tear a hole in you the one you can't repair
But I still love her
I don't really care

[Bridge]
When we were young, oh oh we did enough
When it got cold, ooh ooh we bundled up
I can't be told, ah ah it can't be done

[Verse 2]
It's better to feel pain, than nothing at all
The opposite of love is indifference
So pay attention now
I'm standing on your porch screamin' out
And I won't leave until you come downstairs

[Chorus]
So keep your head up, keep your love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, keep your love

[Verse 3]
And I don't blame you, dear
For running like you did all these years
I would do the same, you best believe
And the highway signs say we're close
But I don't read those things anymore
I never trusted my own eyes

[Bridge]
When we were young, oh oh we did enough
When it got cold, ooh ooh we bundled up
I can't be told, ah ah it can't be done

Used to drive a Nissan now she in a Beamer
I don’t want ‘er cause she from the corner
And I heard that Beamer was a loaner
Her old man, the owner
And don't even drink Carona's
What type of drink you want bruh
On champagne forever
On dirty sprite forever
You can come sip with me
If you’d like to change the weather
If you wanna live better
We can buy a crib, where ever
Don’t get too thirsty, get used to the cheddar
I wanna tell the world about you just so they can get jealous
And if you see ‘er ‘fore I do tell ‘er I wish that I’ve met ‘er

[Hook]
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin’ for ‘er too
I heard she keep her promises, and never turn on you
I heard she ain’t gon cheat and she gon never make no move
I heard she be there anytime you need ‘er, she come through
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
I’m lookin’ for ‘er

[Verse 2]
Send ‘er my way
Tell ‘er I’ve been lookin’ for ‘er in the broad day
Hangin’ with the dope boys in the hallways
And I know, to keep ‘er, yeah you gotta get that pay
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin’ for ‘er too
I heard she got a pretty face and stand up like a stallion
I heard that she a precious jewel, you treat her to medallions
I wanna be the one to find out if I go to prowlin
And if I get her number, you know I can’t wait to dial it
And if we get together, girl, you know we gon be wildin
And when we get together we make magic and it’s ours
Whenever you up here, ain't nun nobody can do about it

[Hook]
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin’ for ‘er too
I heard she keep her promises, and never turn on you
I heard she ain’t gon cheat and she gon never make no move
I heard she be there anytime you need ‘er, she come through
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
I’m lookin’ for ‘er

[Verse 3]
She a hood girl
But she a good girl
She been mislead
Now she ready for the world
I want your energy
To take control of me
I’ve tried to go to sleep
And seen ‘er in my dreams
Just in case I run across her today I'mma stay clean
Just in case you recognize her face, send ‘er to me
And tell ‘er I’ve been lookin’ for ‘er with a flashlight
You can't tell a nigga nothin because I got my cash right
And tell ‘er if she honest I promise to stay true
Make sure, when you tell ‘er, tell ‘er we goin past the moon

[Hook]
Turn on the lights

81,81,Tip It On Back,"[Verse 1]
I see main street closing
Miles of “for sale” signs
And them fields ain’t growing
Fast enough to get us by
I feel the sweet release
Of a Friday night
For a couple of hours we can run this town
Till it runs dry

[Chorus]
Tip it on back, make it feel good
Sip a little more than you know you should
Let the smoke roll, off of your lips
Let it all go whatever it is
And tip it on back

[Verse 2]
So grab the girl you came with
And set her world on fire
And watch her sway and singing to the music
Until it’s all alright
Yeah

[Chorus]
Tip it on back, make it feel good
Sip a little more than you know you should
Let the smoke roll, off of your lips
Let it all go whatever it is
And tip it on back

[Verse 3]
I don’t wanna lose this feeling
And I don’t wanna close my eyes
I don’t wanna remember what I’m here to forget tonight
So tip it on back

[Chorus]
Tip it on back, make it feel good
Sip a little more than you know you should
Let the smoke roll, off of your lips
Let it all go whatever it is
And tip it on back

[Verse 4]
Yeah, I don’t wanna lose this feeling
I don’t wanna close my eyes
I don’t wanna remember what i’m here to forget tonight
So tip it on back
Just tip it on back

83,83,Take A Walk,"[Verse 1]
All these kind of places
Make it seem like it's been ages
And tomorrow some new building will scrape the sky
I love this country dearly
I can feel the ladder clearly
But I never thought I'd be alone to try

Once I was outside Penn Station
Selling red and white carnations
We were still alone
My wife and I
Before we marry, save my money
Brought my dear wife over
Now I work to bring my family stateside

But off the boat they stayed a while
Then scattered across the coast
Once a year I'll see them for a week or so
At most I took a walk

[Hook]
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Practice isn't perfect
But the market cuts a loss
I remind myself that times could be much worse
My wife won't ask me questions
And there's not so much to ask
And she'll never flaunt around an empty purse

Once my mother-in-law came
Just to stay a couple nights
Then decided she would stay the rest of her life
I watch my little children
Play some board game in the kitchen
And I sit and pray they never feel my strife

But then my partner called to say the pension funds were gone
He made some bad investments
Now the accounts are overdrawn
I took a walk

[Hook]
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
Honey it's your son
I think I borrowed just too much
We had taxes, we had bills
We had a lifestyle to front
And tonight I swear I'll come home
And we'll make love like we're young
Tomorrow you'll cook dinner
For the neighbors and their kids
We can rip apart those socialists
And all their damn taxes
You'll see I am no criminal
I'm down on both bad knees
I'm just too much a coward
To admit when I'm in need
I took a walk

[Hook]
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh","['all', 'these', 'kind', 'of', 'place', 'make', 'it', 'seem', 'like', 'its', 'be', 'age', 'and', 'tomorrow', 'some', 'new', 'build', 'will', 'scrape', 'the', 'sky', 'i', 'love', 'this', 'country', 'dearly', 'i', 'can', 'feel', 'the', 'ladder', 'clearly', 'but', 'i', 'never', 'think', 'id', 'be', 'alone', 'to', 'try', 'once', 'i', 'be', 'outside', 'penn', 'station', 'sell', 'red', 'and', 'white', 'carnations', 'we', 'be', 'still', 'alone', 'my', 'wife', 'and', 'i', 'before', 'we', 'marry', 'save', 'my', 'money', 'bring', 'my', 'dear', 'wife', 'over', 'now', 'i', 'work', 'to', 'bring', 'my', 'family', 'stateside', 'but', 'off', 'the', 'boat', 'they', 'stay', 'a', 'while', 'then', 'scatter', 'across', 'the', 'coast', 'once', 'a', 'year', 'ill', 'see', 'them', 'for', 'a', 'week', 'or', 'so', 'at', 'most', 'i', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'ohohoh', 'i', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'ohohoh', 'practice', 'isnt', 'perfect', 'but', 'the', 'market', 'cut', 'a', 'loss', 'i', 'remind', 'myself', 'that', 'time', 'could', 'be', 'much', 'worse', 'my', 'wife', 'wont', 'ask', 'me', 'question', 'and', 'theres', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'to', 'ask', 'and', 'shell', 'never', 'flaunt', 'around', 'an', 'empty', 'purse', 'once', 'my', 'motherinlaw', 'come', 'just', 'to', 'stay', 'a', 'couple', 'nights', 'then', 'decide', 'she', 'would', 'stay', 'the', 'rest', 'of', 'her', 'life', 'i', 'watch', 'my', 'little', 'children', 'play', 'some', 'board', 'game', 'in', 'the', 'kitchen', 'and', 'i', 'sit', 'and', 'pray', 'they', 'never', 'feel', 'my', 'strife', 'but', 'then', 'my', 'partner', 'call', 'to', 'say', 'the', 'pension', 'fund', 'be', 'go', 'he', 'make', 'some', 'bad', 'investments', 'now', 'the', 'account', 'be', 'overdraw', 'i', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'ohohoh', 'i', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'ohohoh', 'honey', 'its', 'your', 'son', 'i', 'think', 'i', 'borrow', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'we', 'have', 'tax', 'we', 'have', 'bill', 'we', 'have', 'a', 'lifestyle', 'to', 'front', 'and', 'tonight', 'i', 'swear', 'ill', 'come', 'home', 'and', 'well', 'make', 'love', 'like', 'be', 'young', 'tomorrow', 'youll', 'cook', 'dinner', 'for', 'the', 'neighbor', 'and', 'their', 'kid', 'we', 'can', 'rip', 'apart', 'those', 'socialists', 'and', 'all', 'their', 'damn', 'tax', 'youll', 'see', 'i', 'be', 'no', 'criminal', 'im', 'down', 'on', 'both', 'bad', 'knees', 'im', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'a', 'coward', 'to', 'admit', 'when', 'im', 'in', 'need', 'i', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'ohohoh', 'i', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'ohohoh', 'i', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'ohohoh', 'i', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'take', 'a', 'walk', 'ohohoh']",426,Passion Pit,Passion Pit,2012,"[86, 91, 93, 99, 93, 90, 90, 89, 85, 86, 95, 87, 89, 85, 87, 99]",16,Take a Walk,https://open.spotify.com/track/4Sfa7hdVkqlM8UW5LsSY3F,4Sfa7hdVkqlM8UW5LsSY3F,spotify:track:4Sfa7hdVkqlM8UW5LsSY3F,Gossamer,14JU5SskmcyckE5I8PY6lv,spotify:album:14JU5SskmcyckE5I8PY6lv,Passion Pit,7gjAu1qr5C2grXeQFFOGeh,spotify:artist:7gjAu1qr5C2grXeQFFOGeh,264.493,12.0,67.0,2012-07-20,0.5660000000000001,0.755,11.0,-5.526,1.0,0.0368,0.0338,0.0,0.315,0.445,101.006,"['alternative dance', 'indie pop', 'indie rock', 'indietronica', 'modern rock', 'pop rock', 'rock', 'shimmer pop']",[],1.0

Hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
Ooh

[Verse 1]
I'm the kind of girl who doesn't say a word
Who sits at the curb and waits for the world
But I'm about to break out, about to break out
I'm like a crook tonight
I caught you staring at me, and I was thinking clearly
And now I'm like a bee and I'm hunting for the honey
And I'm kinda shy, but you're super fly, yeah
I could be your kryptonite, like

Ready or not, here I come
Where you at? The night is young
In the crowd, the music's loud
But I will find you
Ready or not, here I come
I like your face, do you like my song?
Just sing it, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
And I'll find you

Hello, my name is (Bridgit), nice to meet you
I think you're famous, where have I seen you?
You'll be my William, I'll be your Kate
Living like a fairy tale
We could have a palace right next to Oprah
Thirty-seven cars and a yacht down in Boca
Take me away, wherever you say
Yeah, we could be setting sail, like

You and me dance from the night to the dawn
Ready or not, here I come boy, it's on
Ready or not, here I come, here I come
You're like a breath of fresh air in my lungs
You and me dance from the night to the dawn

If you ain't got two kids by 21
You're probably gonna die alone
At least that's what tradition told you
And it don't matter if you don't believe
Come Sunday morning you best be
There in the front row, like you're s'posed to
Same hurt in every heart
Same trailer, different park

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama's hooked on Mary Kay
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down

[Chorus]
Mary Mary quite contrary
We get bored so we get married
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round

[Verse 2]
We think the first time's good enough
So we hold on to high school love
Say we won't end up like our parents
Tiny little boxes in a row
Ain't what you want it's what you know
Just happy in the shoes you're wearin'
Same checks we're always cashin'
To buy a little more distraction

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause Mama's hooked on Mary Kay
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane
And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down

[Chorus]
Mary Mary quite contrary
We get bored so we get married
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round
Mary Mary quite contrary
We're so bored until we're buried
And just like dust we settle in this town
On this broken merry go 'round
And 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops nobody knows
And it ain't slowin' down
This merry go 'round

You got baby mama drama, you ain't even got you no baby!
You fugazi, b-boss up, boss up with your time dog
You ain't got time for no hoes, I ain't even got time for no time off!""
I'm on

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Okay, this to all of my enemies that see me gettin' guap right now
See me gettin' guap right now, see me gettin' guap right now
This to all of my hatin' hoes that see me gettin' guap right now
See me gettin' guap right now, hell yeah, I won't stop right now
This to all my old hoes that see me gettin' guap right now
See me gettin' guap right now, hell yeah, I won't stop right now (Oh God)
See me gettin' guap right now, hell nah, I won't stop right now (Oh God, boi, boi, boi)
Hell nah, I won't stop right now, see me gettin' guap right now

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Okay, I need 50k large (Right now)
My homie just beat the charge (Right now)
My brother need a new job (Right now)
So I be goin' so hard (Right now)
I need my face on a black card (Right now)
My iPhone need a charge (Right now)
My fish tank need sharks (right now)
I need a blimp to say the worlds ours (Right now)
So these niggas can know I do what they can't
I'm stuntin' for all the people who ain't
You still hatin'? You should be fuckin' ashamed
Far as I came, guess when you're running the game they want you to sprain
Yeah, I know, I know, but I don't get my stress on
Takin' shots, swear it's like my stomachs made of Teflon
They like, ""Boy, won't you get your rest on?""
Bitch, cause I'm up for every hour I was slept on
And last night I dreamed about two girls, bisexual
They was tryin' things, trisexual
Then I woke up in a city where the population match the death toll
Drew my blueprint, got it illustrated, F.F. affiliated
Millions chasin' go to sleep wake up continuated
Life of a Don, Chandon sippin', never had a palm readin'
Always had my palms itchin' time to get it
Boy, I was taught to get it 'til it's gone
Even when I got it, watch me get it like I don't

[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean & Kanye West]
Hol' up, hol' up, tell me what you see (What you see)
Pull up (Swerve), watch these mothafuckas freak (Watch 'em freak)
S-say what up though when you see me in the streets
G.O.O.D. Music in this bitch, now drop that mothafuckin' beat, woah

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Okay, this to all of my enemies that see me gettin' guap right now (D-Town)
See me gettin' guap right now, see me gettin' guap right now
This to all of my hatin' hoes that see me gettin' guap right now
See me gettin' guap right now, hell yeah, I won't stop right now
This to all my old hoes that see me gettin' guap right now
See me gettin' guap right now, hell yeah, I won't stop right now
See me gettin' guap right now, hell nah, I won't stop right now
Hell nah, I won't stop right now, see me gettin' guap right now

87,87,Two Black Cadillacs,"[Verse 1]
Two black Cadillacs driving in a slow parade
Headlights shining bright in the middle of the day
One is for his wife
The other for the woman who loved him at night
Two black Cadillacs meeting for the first time

[Chorus]
And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils didn’t bother to cry
Bye bye, bye bye
Yeah they took turns laying a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
He’s not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye

[Break]
Two black Cadillacs
Two black Cadillacs

[Verse 2]
Two months ago, his wife called the number on his phone
Turns out he'd been lying to both of them for oh so long
They decided then, he’d never get away with doing this to them
Two black Cadillacs waiting for the right time, the right time

[Chorus]
And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils didn’t bother to cry
Bye bye, bye bye
Yeah, they took turns laying a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
He’s not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Yeah, yeah
Two black Cadillacs

[Bridge]
It was the first and the last time they saw each other face to face
They shared a crimson smile and just walked away
And left the secret at the grave

[Chorus]
And the preacher said he was a good man
And his brother said he was a good friend
But the women in the two black veils, they didn’t bother to cry
Bye bye, bye bye (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, they took turns laying a rose down
Threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
He’s not the only one who had a secret to hide
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye

We don’t wanna
We don’t wanna
We don’t wanna neva end
We don’t wanna
We don’t wanna neva end
We don’t wanna
We don’t wanna neva end
We don’t wanna neva

[Chorus]
We don’t wanna neva end
It's like our life has just began
You walkin’ out, you comin’ back again
Cause we became the best of friends
You got all the questions and I know all the answers
I done took your heart, girl and hold it up for ransom
We don’t wanna neva end
We don’t wanna
We don’t wanna neva end
We don’t wanna

[Verse 1]
I could tell you was into me from our instant chemistry
As I reflect memory, you ride or you die for me
I'll go to war over you want, I dont give a fuck by showing you
You know what it is shawty, forever my lil shawty
Long as I’m swimmin’ in Benjamins, you shop with no limited
You reminisce every session, know you’ll come back again
I know you can’t breath without me, you gon' need your oxygen
I damn near gave you a overdose on my own medicine
I took a sip of your tea and I ain’t been right ever since
As I think to myself what’d it be is it heaven sent
Let’s put the past behind us
And go far away where nobody can find us

[Chorus]
We don’t wanna neva end
It's like our life has just began
You walkin’ out, you comin’ back again
Cause we became the best of friends
You got all the questions and I know all the answers
I done took your heart, girl and hold it up for ransom
We don’t wanna neva end
We don’t wanna
We don’t wanna neva end
We don’t wanna

[Verse 2]
You could leave today I bet you’ll come back tomorrow
I could see the hate is comin’ from a mile up
And it’s only preparin’ us for what we got comin’
If I did come your way and you feel like runnin’
Run in my direction and don’t you run from me
Cause any time we get together, we goin’ stuntin’
And I’m applyin’ major pressure, feel it in your stomach
It’s lightnin', it’s thunderin', you describin', got me wonderin'
Butterfly, butterfly
Will you gon ever leave?
Any time you leave my side
I know you comin’ back
I know you comin’ back to me

[Chorus]
We don’t wanna neva end
It's like our life has just began
You walkin’ out, you comin’ back again
Cause we became the best of friends
You got all the questions and I know all the answers
I done took your heart, girl and hold it up for ransom
We don’t wanna neva end
We don’t wanna
We don’t wanna neva end
We don’t wanna

[Bridge]
Is there anything you wanna know?
Is there any place you rather be?
You walk until your feet get sore
I bet you walking back
And I bet you walking back to me
Actually that’s a guarantee
My friendship a guarantee
You got my ego in another league
I ain’t tryna be cocky
I got your heart in my pocket

[Chorus]
We don’t wanna neva end
It's like our life has just began
You walkin’ out, you comin’ back again
Cause we became the best of friends
You got all the questions and I know all the answers
I done took your heart, girl and hold it up for ransom

89,89,Young & Gettin' It,"[Intro: Kirko Bangz]
Young and I’m getting it, young and I’m getting it
Young and I’m getting it, young and I’m getting it
I’m just young and I'm living, shit
I just want the money, y’all can keep them bitches
Cause I’m young and I’m getting it, I’m young and I’m getting it

[Hook: Kirko Bangz]
Ok, I wake up in the morning and I see dollar signs
And shawty wanna roll, I’m like oh man she fine
I got money all in my pocket and my Audemars on shine
So why you hating on me, huh, I’m just living my life
I’m just young and I’m getting it, young and I’m getting it
Young and I’m getting it, young and I’m getting it
I’m just young and I don’t give a shit
I just want the money, y’all can keep them bitches
Cause I’m young and I’m getting it, I’m young and I’m getting it

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Yeah, young nigga I get money and fuck hoes on my spare time
She don’t fuck on the first night, then she don’t meet my deadline
Niggas smokin that Bob Marley, that Bob Marley like Yea Mon
I’m sipping on the whole eighth of the purp shit, bed time
I cop foreigns like Jordans, y'all niggas ain’t important
Shawty want that molly, and I’ma get what she order
Tats all on my body, strapped up like a war
Eat the pussy I prolly, if it smell like water
Her neck talk say fuck me, my wrist talk say suck me
The niggas claiming they balling, I take your bitch Kris Humphries
And make them buy me a whip nigga, nothing less than the 6 nigga
Yall ran your mouth like hoes, all you are some bitch niggas

[Hook: Kirko Bangz]
Ok, I wake up in the morning and I see dollar signs
And shawty wanna roll, I’m like oh man she fine
I got money all in my pocket and my Audermar on shine
So why you hating on me, huh, I’m just living my life
I’m just young and I’m getting it, young and I’m getting it
Young and I’m getting it, young and I’m getting it
I’m just young and I don’t give a shit
I just want the money, y’all can keep them bitches
Cause I’m young and I’m getting it, I’m young and I’m getting it

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Okay, your baby mama: I bought that, side chick: I bought that
Main chick: I bought that, and your dream girl just called back
I’m still repping that north side with that big P on my ballcap
These broke niggas don’t like me, cause they say I think I’m all that
Now Coon cop that ‘rarri, I don’t even feel salty
Niggas claimin my flows I should put these niggas on Maury
And I ain’t claming these hoes, have these haters looking all sorry
When I pulled up in that Rolls, swag was surfing on ‘em like gnarley
I’m with 3 hoes like Santa Claus, and I’m the boss, Diana Ross
Hit you girl by mistake nigga, wasn’t even in my plan at all
I told homie I hit it there, this nigga wanna be playing it off
Knowing that girl is main thang, that shit don’t like nigga, bang bang!

92,92,Dance For You,"[Verse 1]
I just wanna show you how much I appreciate you, yes
Wanna show you how much I'm dedicated to you, yes
Wanna show you how much I will forever be true, yes
Wanna show you how much you got your girl feeling good, yes
Wanna show you how much, how much you understood, yes
Wanna show you how much I value what you say
Not only are you loyal, you're patient with me babe, yes
Wanna show you how much I really care about your heart
Wanna show you how much I hate being apart, yes
Wanna show you show you show you till you through with me
I wanna keep it how it is but you can never say how it used to be!

[Pre-Chorus]
Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night
I wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch!

[Chorus]
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy, I like it when you watch me, ah
Tonight it's going down
I'll be rocking on my babe, rocking, rocking on my babe
Swirling on my babe, swirling, swirling on my babe
Baby, let me put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody
'Cause it's about to go down

[Verse 2]
You'll never need two 'cause I will be your number one
Them other chicks are superficial
But I know you know I'm the one
That's why I'm all into you
'Cause I can recognize that you know that
That's why I'm backing this thing back
Pop-popping this thing back
Drop, drop, drop-dropping this thing back
This is for the time you gave me flowers
For the world that is ours
For the mula, for the power of love
And no I won't never ever e-ever give you up
And I wanna say thank you in case I don't thank you enough
A woman in the street and a freak in the you know what
Sit back, sit back, it's the pre-game show
Daddy, you know what's up

[Pre-Chorus]
Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night
I wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch

[Chorus]
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy, I like it when you watch me, ah
Tonight it's going down
I'll be rocking on my babe, rocking, rocking on my babe
I'll be swirling on my babe, swirling, swirling on you, babe
I wanna put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody
'Cause it's about to go down

[Bridge]
I'm a take this time to show you how much you mean to me
'Cause you are all I need
No money can emphasize
Or describe
The love that's in-between the lines
Boy look into my eyes
While I'm grinding on you
This is beyond sex
I'm high on you
If it's real then you know how I feel
Rocking on you, babe, rocking, rocking on you, babe
Swirling on you, babe
In my mind all I can think about is a frame for our future
And the pictures of the past and a chance to make this love last

[Hook]
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah
Tonight it's going down
I'll be rocking on my babe, rocking, rocking on my babe
I'll be swirling on my babe, swirling, swirling on my babe
I wanna put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody
'Cause it's about to go down

[Outro]
Watch me p-pop it, p-pop it for you, baby
Drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it for you, baby
Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch me roll it, baby

Watch me p-pop it, p-pop it for you, baby
Drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it for you, baby

This ain't for no fuck-nigga
If you a real nigga, then fuck with me
This one for the hood niggas
Hipster bitches that shop at Lenox
Dark skinned, light skinned
Asian and white women
Hypebeasts we know aboutchea'
Don't buy shoes unless they popular
For the hoes, my nigga
That's pussy poppin' at Magic City
Got that strong, my nigga
Then come match that shit with me
Smokin' mid, my nigga
Then don't pass that shit to me
This one for my niggas
And bitches 'bout that money (Cash Out)
Gotta love, Chesire Bridge
Them bad hoes at Onyx
I don't fuck with no snitches
So don't tell me who tellin'
This one for them colleges
Them bad hoes at Spelman
Shout out to them freshmen
On Instagram straight flexin'
Popped a molly, I'm sweatin', woo
Popped a molly, I'm sweatin', woo
Mama always told me: ""Boy, count your blessings.""
In God I trust, so I kept counting them Franklins
I'm too fly, you know this
Let me give your ass a checklist
One gold watch, two gold chains
Six gold rings, it's nothin' (Goddamn!)
OG Jordans, them high socks
No shirt on, I'm stuntin' (Okay!)
And this song for them fuck-niggas
Who hating on you this summer (Fuck 'em!)
Talk shit behind your back
But won't say shit in public (Fuck 'em!)

And truth be told, I'm wavin' my flag before it goes bad, yeah yeah

I wanna feel it even if it hurts
If I gotta cry to get to the other side
Let's go cause we're gon' survive, oh

Yeah, but we're still here after the bomb drops

The fire starts then we explode
When the smoke clears we dry our tears

Sometimes you're my general
You quarterback all these plays
Sometimes you're my enemy and I'm throwin' grenades
We'll just be chillin' and laughin', I'm layin' on your chest
I don't know what I did cause things just went left
But here we go back down that road
That's just the way that it goes

I’ll be representing, representing
I’ll be representing, representing

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
You represent for bad bitches all around the world
The way you put it down in between the sheets
Is like no other girl
You done take it a whole another level of freakiness
When you blow my mind
To the point where all the other women
Kinda feeling like you stole their shine
So I better come with it, then I better come spilt it
And I can admit that I’m feeling a little pressure
When you’re telling me I better come get it
But I’m the man for the job
Can’t nobody do it quite like I do
And the same go for you
We a match made in heaven
I’ma stand right by you
While you saying

[Pre-chorus: Kelly Rowland, Ludacris, Both]
Just wanna keep all your attention baby
(Yeah, alright, alright, alright, hey)
It turns me on to know I turn you on
Yeah, ok, ok, ok, hey
Can I grab the wheel and drive you crazy?
(Yeah, alright, alright, alright, hey)
Sit in the front row and watch me perform
(You do that and you gonna learn today)

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland & Ludacris]
I’ll Be representing, representing
Get on that thang, get on that thang
Get on that thang and represent
I’ll be representing, representing
Get on that thang, get on that thang
Get on that thang
Watch how I put it down

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Put it down like ay
Only know you can do it
Then I’ma hit every single one of your spots
And really you don’t need to walk me through it
But you can talk me through it
What I’m asking if it’s mine
Cause I'mma be your motivation
Just tryna see if you can break my fucking spine
I’m so attracted, to the way you carry yourself
And keep your composure
You a lady in the street
But behind closed doors you’re a fucking soldier
A brother would never know
That’s how you like it ha
But that booty pack a mean punch
And I’ma spike it, huh, while you saying

[Pre-chorus: Kelly Rowland, Ludacris, Both]
Just wanna keep all your attention baby
(Yeah, alright, alright, alright, hey)
It turns me on to know I turn you on
Yeah, ok, ok, ok, hey

I’ll be representing, representing
Get on that thang, get on that thang
Get on that thang and represent
I’ll be representing, representing
Get on that thang, get on that thang
Get on that thang
Watch how I put it down

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
You’re incredible, edible, unforgettable
Body is so angelical, the rebel with a cause
Speaking in hypotheticals
Could I marry you if I wanted to
I’ll take you how you coming
Just learn to live with your flaws
Even though it’s not that many
You give me that good and plenty
Then I walk around all day grinning
My mind and body are gone
That jj so sublime throw it in the air and turn to sunshine
You make me wanna call the crib
And say I’m never coming home, Luda!
While you saying

[Pre-Hook: Kelly Rowland, Ludacris, Both]
Just wanna keep all your attention baby (Keep all your attention)
(Yeah, alright, alright, alright, hey)
It turns me on to know I turn you on
Yeah, ok, ok, ok, hey
Can I grab the wheel and drive you crazy? (Yeah)

96,96,My Life,"The shuffle goes on, now it's My Life by Eminem, 50 and Adam

A guitar riff introduces the song, a little beat comes on
Adam sings the chorus saying maybe his life might be against him
He feels like running away. Without a place to go
Confused, disillusioned, like this is some sick plot from a director that hates him

50 then relates his life lessons saying how he came from nothing and how he regretted helping other people sometimes because they are ungrateful, so he decides to keep his 50 cents to himself instead of helping others because he could instead be an entrepreneur and start a business or something he doesn't need to be anyone's savior

Eminem says he's getting ready for war, training or something
Sharpening his machete. He doesn't fool me, he only says it's lyrically to avoid all the prosecution from lawyers and whatever
He knows the world is against him, he feels it under his skin, so he prepares for the time his fate goes against him. Wishes he could somehow open your eyes to the truth

50 again says that was a good thing. Waking up from the neediness and accepting some of the hate and use it as a motivation to get stronger. It doesn't do any good to just wallow in self pity, you gotta improve despite the bad circumstances","['the', 'shuffle', 'go', 'on', 'now', 'its', 'my', 'life', 'by', 'eminem', '50', 'and', 'adam', 'a', 'guitar', 'riff', 'introduce', 'the', 'song', 'a', 'little', 'beat', 'come', 'on', 'adam', 'sing', 'the', 'chorus', 'say', 'maybe', 'his', 'life', 'might', 'be', 'against', 'him', 'he', 'feel', 'like', 'run', 'away', 'without', 'a', 'place', 'to', 'go', 'confuse', 'disillusion', 'like', 'this', 'be', 'some', 'sick', 'plot', 'from', 'a', 'director', 'that', 'hat', 'him', '50', 'then', 'relate', 'his', 'life', 'lessons', 'say', 'how', 'he', 'come', 'from', 'nothing', 'and', 'how', 'he', 'regret', 'help', 'other', 'people', 'sometimes', 'because', 'they', 'be', 'ungrateful', 'so', 'he', 'decide', 'to', 'keep', 'his', '50', 'cents', 'to', 'himself', 'instead', 'of', 'help', 'others', 'because', 'he', 'could', 'instead', 'be', 'an', 'entrepreneur', 'and', 'start', 'a', 'business', 'or', 'something', 'he', 'doesnt', 'need', 'to', 'be', 'anyones', 'savior', 'eminem', 'say', 'hes', 'get', 'ready', 'for', 'war', 'train', 'or', 'something', 'sharpen', 'his', 'machete', 'he', 'doesnt', 'fool', 'me', 'he', 'only', 'say', 'its', 'lyrically', 'to', 'avoid', 'all', 'the', 'prosecution', 'from', 'lawyers', 'and', 'whatever', 'he', 'know', 'the', 'world', 'be', 'against', 'him', 'he', 'feel', 'it', 'under', 'his', 'skin', 'so', 'he', 'prepare', 'for', 'the', 'time', 'his', 'fate', 'go', 'against', 'him', 'wish', 'he', 'could', 'somehow', 'open', 'your', 'eye', 'to', 'the', 'truth', '50', 'again', 'say', 'that', 'be', 'a', 'good', 'thing', 'wake', 'up', 'from', 'the', 'neediness', 'and', 'accept', 'some', 'of', 'the', 'hate', 'and', 'use', 'it', 'as', 'a', 'motivation', 'to', 'get', 'stronger', 'it', 'doesnt', 'do', 'any', 'good', 'to', 'just', 'wallow', 'in', 'self', 'pity', 'you', 'gotta', 'improve', 'despite', 'the', 'bad', 'circumstances']",229,James Kirk Bogucheski,50 Cent Featuring Eminem & Adam Levine,2012,"[99, 80, 27]",3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0

In this crazy world of choices, I've only got a few
Either you're coming with me or I'm coming with you

You never have to worry if what I say is true
Girl, I've been looking for you
And when I saw you I knew
That I finally found, I finally found you

[Verse 3: Sammy Adams]
Yeah, so can I get love?
Too much to ask for, really so tough
Find yourself moving with the sex of the drums
Got my hands full, grabbing all these girls, girls
Hands up, hands up
Dance floor chillin' when I hold two cups
Can't stop spilling 'cause I'm drunk as fuck
And my song comes on and the club goes nuts
Every province I go, city I sleep, it's best that ya’ll know
Running around, and doing all these shows
Round the whole globe, I come, and you go girl
And you need to think of it
Just wrap for the night, baby, live a bit
With a place to hit, and your pants to zip
You can make a scene and party, are you into it?

I'm a sorry sucker
And this happens all the time
I find out that everybody talks
Everybody talks, everybody talks

I can hear the chit chat
Take me to your love shack
Mama's always got a backtrack
When everybody talks back

Hey honey you could be my drug
You could be my new prescription
Too much could be an overdose
All this trash talk make me itching

And that was when I kissed her
And then she made my lips hurt

Never thought I'd live
To see the day
When everybody's words
Got in the way

Hey sugar show me all your love
All you're giving me is friction
Hey sugar what you gotta say?

Hundred out the lot, I be leanin', that CÎROC
Hundred large, bring a mop
Car's tinted like Barack
Got a Brinks truck in my pocket (Pocket)
30 chains on my collar (Collar)
Two drops, no mileage (Mileage)

And I'm inhalin' smoke, bitch know that (Know that)
Filthy rich before rap ('Fore rap)

I love my big booty bitches, my life a Godfather picture
Local club in my city, I fell in love with a stripper
Bitches know I'm that nigga, talkin' four-door Bugatti
I'm the life of the party, let's get these hoes on the Molly
You know I came to stunt, so drop that pussy, bitch
I got what you want, drop that pussy, bitch (Woo)
Film it, film it, this bitch want me to film it
Ballin', ballin' like I play for New England
Spend it, spend it, spend a stack every minute
That's 50... one hundred, I see no fuckin' limits
Shout out to Uncle Luke (Huh)
Shout out my bitches too (Huh)
We the 2 Live Crew
Two for me, two for you (Woo)

Money comin', money goin', ain't like you could take it with you (Alright)
It's about to be a hit right now, fuck back then we the shit right now
Dropped Take Care, bought a mothafuckin' crib
And I'm pickin' up the keys to the bitch right now
OVO that's major shit, Toronto with me that's mayor shit
Gettin cheddar packs like K.D., OKC that's player shit
We don't dress alike, we don't rap alike
I shine different, I rhyme different
Only thing you got is some years on me
Man fuck you and your time difference
I'm Young Papi, Champagne
They know the face and they know the name
Got one watch that could prolly pay for like all your chains
And you'd owe me change, ah!
Greystone, 20 bottles that's all me
On the couch, wildin' out yelling free my niggas 'til they all free
One of my closest dawgs got three kids and they all three
But we always been that type of crew that been good without a plan B, so

That’s gangsta: Al Capone
I make that pussy spit like Bone
I'm talkin' 'bout bone, bone, bone bone
I'm fuckin' with French, excuse my French
I lose my mind before I lose my bitch
Money ain't a thing but a chicken wing
Bitch I ball like two eyelids
YMCM beat that pussy up, stop playin'
I make her ass scream and holla like rock bands
I'm a beast, I'm off the leash
I am rich like a bitch
On my Proactiv shit, pop that pussy like a zit
I go by the name Lil Tunechi
Your girl is a groupie
And nigga, you's a square
And I will twist you like in a Rubik's
Motherfucker I'm on my skateboard
Watch me do a trick, ho
I’m 5'5"" but I could 6-9
Then beat that pussy like Klitschko
It's French Montana, fuck Joe
It's Weezy F, fuck hoes

101,101,When I Was Your Man,"[Verse 1]
Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize

[Chorus]
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

[Verse 2]
My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made (oh)
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize

[Chorus]
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

[Bridge]
Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

[Chorus]
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man

I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life
I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me

A little time to look around me

Let it go, let it go, homie
You know we can see through them blinds, homie
And see through the truth and them lies, homie
Just let it go, let it go, let it go
Ohhhh, ohhhh
Ohhhh, ohhhh
(Uh, all niggas know what the fuck is, man
Young Khalifa Man
Hahahahahah)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, I done stayed on top of my game
Gained control of my lane
Paid so much for my frames
Put these lil' niggas to shame
Ordered so many them bottles, so many them bottles, you would think I'm insane
Already changed the game once, I done told you but now I'mma do it and now I'mma do it again
Tell the club owners we need more sections
I made these lil' niggas go cop they Rolexes
You get the venue, you gon' need more bouncers
And tell the weed man we gon' need more ounces
Hundred grand in a rubber band
Use to be the kid, now homie, I'm the man
Hundred grand in a rubber band
I used to be the kid, now homie, I'm the man

[Hook: Akon]
Let it go, let it go, homie
You know we can see through them blinds, homie
And see through the truth and them lies, homie
Just let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, homie
You know they can't see what we see, homie
Difference from the real and make believe, homie
So let it go, let it go, let it go

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Living my life about peace
Sharing this money and trying to get all my niggas up off of them streets
Used to look up to some niggas but now it seem that it all come down to me
Make sure my family gon' eat
Grinding from up underneath
Now they just say I'm a, now they just say I'm a beast
And now all these haters looking at me pitifully
Cause I'm the shit, literally
And I be stuntin' when I ride past my old school
I say fuck the new car, I cop the old-school

[Hook: Akon]
Let it go, let it go, homie
You know we can see through them blinds, homie
And see through the truth and them lies, homie
Just let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, homie
You know they can't see what we see, homie
Difference from the real and make believe, homie
So let it go, let it go, let it go

[Bridge: Akon]
Let it go, let it go, let it go
So let them go, let them go, let them go
Let them know
Let them know, let them know

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
This time I feel like it;s now or never
Ain't going nowhere, so no matter what they say, I'll be here forever
Even though some folks will make it so you can't win
Don't need to take it on the chin
Remember, homie, you ain't even gotta hold it in

[Hook: Akon]
Let it go, let it go, homie
You know we can see through them blinds, homie
And see through the truth and them lies, homie
Just let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, homie
You know they can't see what we see, homie
Difference from the real and make believe, homie
So let it go, let it go, let it go

[Bridge: Akon]
Let it go, let it go, let it go
So let them go, let them go, let them go
Let them know
Let them know, let them know

I can usually drink you right off of my mind
But I miss you tonight
I can normally push you right out of my heart
But I'm too tired to fight
Yeah the whole thing begins
And I let you sink into my veins
And I feel the pain like it's new
Everything that we were
Everything that you said
Everything that I did and that I couldn't do
Plays through tonight

Tonight your memory burns like a fire
With every one, it grows higher and higher
And I can't get over it

I just sit in these flames
And pray that you'll come back
Close my eyes tightly, hold on and
Hope that I'm dreaming

But I can't forget

I'm down to my last cigarette
Yeah, you're probably asleep deep inside of your dreams
While I'm sitting here crying and trying to see
Yeah, wherever you are, baby now I am sure you moved on
And aren't thinking twice about me and you tonight

Tonight your memory burns like a fire

I know that you can't hear me
But baby I need you to save me tonight

   To admit you to the 'little nucleus,' the 'little group,' the 'little clan' at the Verdurins', one condition sufficed, but that one was indispensable; you must give tacit adherence to a Creed one of whose articles was that the young pianist, whom Mme. Verdurin had taken under her patronage that year, and of whom she said ""Really, it oughtn't to be allowed, to play Wagner as well as that!"" left both Planté and Rubinstein 'sitting'; while Dr. Cottard was a more brilliant diagnostician than Potain. Each 'new recruit' whom the Verdurins failed to persuade that the evenings spent by other people, in other houses than theirs, were as dull as ditch-water, saw himself banished forthwith. Women being in this respect more rebellious than men, more reluctant to lay aside all worldly curiosity and the desire to find out for themselves whether other drawing-rooms might not sometimes be as entertaining, and the Verdurins feeling, moreover, that this critical spirit and this demon of frivolity might, by their contagion, prove fatal to the orthodoxy of the little church, they had been obliged to expel, one after another, all those of the 'faithful' who were of the female sex

   Apart from the doctor's young wife, they were reduced almost exclusively that season (for all that Mme. Verdurin herself was a thoroughly 'good' woman, and came of a respectable middle-class family, excessively rich and wholly undistinguished, with which she had gradually and of her own accord severed all connection) to a young woman almost of a 'certain class,' a Mme. de Crécy, whom Mme. Verdurin called by her Christian name, Odette, and pronounced a 'love,' and to the pianist's aunt, who looked as though she had, at one period, 'answered the bell': ladies quite ignorant of the world, who in their social simplicity were so easily led to believe that the Princesse de Sagan and the Duchesse de Guermantes were obliged to pay large sums of money to other poor wretches, in order to have anyone at their dinner-parties, that if somebody had offered to procure them an invitation to the house of either of those great dames, the old doorkeeper and the woman of 'easy virtue' would have contemptuously declined

   The Verdurins never invited you to dinner; you had your 'place laid' there. There was never any programme for the evening's entertainment. The young pianist would play, but only if he felt inclined, for no one was forced to do anything, and, as M. Verdurin used to say: ""We're all friends here. Liberty Hall, you know!""

   If the pianist suggested playing the Ride of the Valkyries, or the Prelude to Tristan, Mme. Verdurin would protest, not that the music was displeasing to her, but, on the contrary, that it made too violent an impression. ""Then you want me to have one of my headaches? You know quite well, it's the same every time he plays that. I know what I'm in for. Tomorrow, when I want to get up—nothing doing!"" If he was not going to play they talked, and one of the friends—usually the painter who was in favour there that year—would ""spin,"" as M. Verdurin put it, ""a damned funny yarn that made 'em all split with laughter,"" and especially Mme. Verdurin, for whom—so strong was her habit of taking literally the figurative accounts of her emotions—Dr. Cottard, who was then just starting in general practice, would ""really have to come one day and set her jaw, which she had dislocated with laughing too much.""

   Evening dress was barred, because you were all 'good pals,' and didn't want to look like the 'boring people' who were to be avoided like the plague, and only asked to the big evenings, which were given as seldom as possible, and then only if it would amuse the painter or make the musician better known. The rest of the time you were quite happy playing charades and having supper in fancy dress, and there was no need to mingle any strange element with the little 'clan.'

   But just as the 'good pals' came to take a more and more prominent place in Mme. Verdurin's life, so the 'bores,' the 'nuisances' grew to include everybody and everything that kept her friends away from her, that made them sometimes plead 'previous engagements,' the mother of one, the professional duties of another, the 'little place in the country' of a third. If Dr. Cottard felt bound to say good night as soon as they rose from table, so as to go back to some patient who was seriously ill; ""I don't know,"" Mme. Verdurin would say, ""I'm sure it will do him far more good if you don't go disturbing him again this evening; he will have a good night without you; to-morrow morning you can go round early and you will find him cured."" From the beginning of December it would make her quite ill to think that the 'faithful' might fail her on Christmas and New Year's Days. The pianist's aunt insisted that he must accompany her, on the latter, to a family dinner at her mother's

   ""You don't suppose she'll die, your mother,"" exclaimed Mme. Verdurin bitterly, ""if you don't have dinner with her on New Year's Day, like people in the provinces!""

   Her uneasiness was kindled again in Holy Week: ""Now you, Doctor, you're a sensible, broad-minded man; you'll come, of course, on Good Friday, just like any other day?"" she said to Cottard in the first year of the little 'nucleus,' in a loud and confident voice, as though there could be no doubt of his answer. But she trembled as she waited for it, for if he did not come she might find herself condemned to dine alone

   ""I shall come on Good Friday—to say good-bye to you, for we are going to spend the holidays in Auvergne.""

   ""In Auvergne? To be eaten by fleas and all sorts of creatures! A fine lot of good that will do you!"" And after a solemn pause: ""If you had only told us, we would have tried to get up a party, and all gone there together, comfortably.""

   And so, too, if one of the 'faithful' had a friend, or one of the ladies a young man, who was liable, now and then, to make them miss an evening, the Verdurins, who were not in the least afraid of a woman's having a lover, provided that she had him in their company, loved him in their company and did not prefer him to their company, would say: ""Very well, then, bring your friend along."" And he would be put to the test, to see whether he was willing to have no secrets from Mme. Verdurin, whether he was susceptible of being enrolled in the 'little clan.' If he failed to pass, the faithful one who had introduced him would be taken on one side, and would be tactfully assisted to quarrel with the friend or mistress. But if the test proved satisfactory, the newcomer would in turn be numbered among the 'faithful.' And so when, in the course of this same year, the courtesan told M. Verdurin that she had made the acquaintance of such a charming gentleman, M. Swann, and hinted that he would very much like to be allowed to come, M. Verdurin carried the request at once to his wife. He never formed an opinion on any subject until she had formed hers, his special duty being to carry out her wishes and those of the 'faithful' generally, which he did with boundless ingenuity

   ""My dear, Mme. de Crécy has something to say to you. She would like to bring one of her friends here, a M. Swann. What do you say?""

   ""Why, as if anybody could refuse anything to a little piece of perfection like that. Be quiet; no one asked your opinion. I tell you that you are a piece of perfection.""

   ""Just as you like,"" replied Odette, in an affected tone, and then went on: ""You know I'm not fishing for compliments.""

   ""Very well; bring your friend, if he's nice.""

   Now there was no connection whatsoever between the 'little nucleus' and the society which Swann frequented, and a purely worldly man would have thought it hardly worth his while, when occupying so exceptional a position in the world, to seek an introduction to the Verdurins. But Swann was so ardent a lover that, once he had got to know almost all the women of the aristocracy, once they had taught him all that there was to learn, he had ceased to regard those naturalisation papers, almost a patent of nobility, which the Faubourg Saint-Germain had bestowed upon him, save as a sort of negotiable bond, a letter of credit with no intrinsic value, which allowed him to improvise a status for himself in some little hole in the country, or in some obscure quarter of Paris, where the good-looking daughter of a local squire or solicitor had taken his fancy. For at such times desire, or love itself, would revive in him a feeling of vanity from which he was now quite free in his everyday life, although it was, no doubt, the same feeling which had originally prompted him towards that career as a man of fashion in which he had squandered his intellectual gifts upon frivolous amusements, and had made use of his erudition in matters of art only to advise society ladies what pictures to buy and how to decorate their houses; and this vanity it was which made him eager to shine, in the sight of any fair unknown who had captivated him for the moment, with a brilliance which the name of Swann by itself did not emit. And he was most eager when the fair unknown was in humble circumstances. Just as it is not by other men of intelligence that an intelligent man is afraid of being thought a fool, so it is not by the great gentleman but by boors and 'bounders' that a man of fashion is afraid of finding his social value underrated. Three-fourths of the mental ingenuity displayed, of the social falsehoods scattered broadcast ever since the world began by people whose importance they have served only to diminish, have been aimed at inferiors. And Swann, who behaved quite simply and was at his ease when with a duchess, would tremble^ for fear of being despised, and would instantly begin to pose, were he to meet her grace's maid

   Unlike so many people, who, either from lack of energy or else from a resigned sense of the obligation laid upon them by their social grandeur to remain moored like houseboats to a certain point on the bank of the stream of life, abstain from the pleasures which are offered to them above and below that point, that degree in life in which they will remain fixed until the day of their death, and are content, in the end, to describe as pleasures, for want of any better, those mediocre distractions, that just not intolerable tedium which is enclosed there with them; Swann would endeavour not to find charm and beauty in the women with whom he must pass time, but to pass his time among women whom he had already found to be beautiful and charming. And these were, as often as not, women whose beauty was of a distinctly 'common' type, for the physical qualities which attracted him instinctively, and without reason, were the direct opposite of those that he admired in the women painted or sculptured by his favourite masters. Depth of character, or a melancholy expression on a woman's face would freeze his senses, which would, however, immediately melt at the sight of healthy, abundant, rosy human flesh

   If on his travels he met a family whom it would have been more correct for him to make no attempt to know, but among whom a woman caught his eye, adorned with a special charm that was new to him, to remain on his 'high horse' and to cheat the desire that she had kindled in him, to substitute a pleasure different from that which he might have tasted in her company by writing to invite one of his former mistresses to come and join him, would have seemed to him as cowardly an abdication in the face of life, as stupid a renunciation of a new form of happiness as if, instead of visiting the country where he was, he had shut himself up in his own rooms and looked at 'views' of Paris. He did not immure himself in the solid structure of his social relations, but had made of them, so as to be able to set it up afresh upon new foundations wherever a woman might take his fancy, one of those collapsible tents which explorers carry about with them. Any part of it which was not portable or could not be adapted to some fresh pleasure he would discard as valueless, however enviable it might appear to others. How often had his credit with a duchess, built up of the yearly accumulation of her desire to do him some favour for which she had never found an opportunity, been squandered in a moment by his calling upon her, in an indiscreetly worded message, for a recommendation by telegraph which would put him in touch at once with one of her agents whose daughter he had noticed in the country, just as a starving man might barter a diamond for a crust of bread. Indeed, when it was too late, he would laugh at himself for it, for there was in his nature, redeemed by many rare refinements, an element of clownishness. Then he belonged to that class of intelligent men who have led a life of idleness, and who seek consolation and, perhaps, an excuse in the idea, which their idleness offers to their intelligence, of objects as worthy of their interest as any that could be attained by art or learning, the idea that 'Life' contains situations more interesting and more romantic than all the romances ever written. So, at least, he would assure and had no difficulty in persuading the more subtle among his friends in the fashionable world, notably the Baron de Charlus, whom he liked to amuse with stories of the startling adventures that had befallen him, such as when he had met a woman in the train, and had taken her home with him, before discovering that she was the sister of a reigning monarch, in whose hands were gathered, at that moment, all the threads of European politics, of which he found himself kept informed in the most delightful fashion, or when, in the complexity of circumstances, it depended upon the choice which the Conclave was about to make whether he might or might not become the lover of somebody's cook

   It was not only the brilliant phalanx of virtuous dowagers, generals and academicians, to whom he was bound by such close ties, that Swann compelled with so much cynicism to serve him as panders. All his friends were accustomed to receive, from time to time, letters which called on them for a word of recommendation or introduction, with a diplomatic adroitness which, persisting throughout all his successive 'affairs' and using different pretexts, revealed more glaringly than the clumsiest indiscretion, a permanent trait in his character and an unvarying quest. I used often to recall to myself when, many years later, I began to take an interest in his character because of the similarities which, in wholly different respects, it offered to my own, how, when he used to write to my grandfather (though not at the time we are now considering, for it was about the date of my own birth that Swann's great 'affair' began, and made a long interruption in his amatory practices) the latter, recognising his friend's handwriting on the envelope, would exclaim: ""Here is Swann asking for something; on guard!"" And, either from distrust or from the unconscious spirit of devilry which urges us to offer a thing only to those who do not want it, my grandparents would meet with an obstinate refusal the most easily satisfied of his prayers, as when he begged them for an introduction to a girl who dined with us every Sunday, and whom they were obliged, whenever Swann mentioned her, to pretend that they no longer saw, although they would be wondering, all through the week, whom they could invite to meet her, and often failed, in the end, to find anyone, sooner than make a sign to him who would so gladly have accepted

   Occasionally a couple of my grandparents' acquaintance, who had been complaining for some time that they never saw Swann now, would announce with satisfaction, and perhaps with a slight inclination to make my grandparents envious of them, that he had suddenly become as charming as he could possibly be, and was never out of their house. My grandfather would not care to shatter their pleasant illusion, but would look at my grandmother, as he hummed the air of:

              What is this mystery?
              I cannot understand it;

   Or of:

              Vision fugitive...;
              In matters such as this
             'Tis best to close one's eyes

   A few months later, if my grandfather asked Swann's new friend ""What about Swann? Do you still see as much of him as ever?"" the other's face would lengthen: ""Never mention his name to me again!""

   ""But I thought that you were such friends...""

   He had been intimate in this way for several months with some cousins of my grandmother, dining almost every evening at their house. Suddenly, and without any warning, he ceased to appear. They supposed him to be ill, and the lady of the house was going to send to inquire for him when, in her kitchen, she found a letter in his hand, which her cook had left by accident in the housekeeping book. In this he announced that he was leaving Paris and would not be able to come to the house again. The cook had been his mistress, and at the moment of breaking off relations she was the only one of the household whom he had thought it necessary to inform

   But when his mistress for the time being was a woman in society, or at least one whose birth was not so lowly, nor her position so irregular that he was unable to arrange for her reception in 'society,' then for her sake he would return to it, but only to the particular orbit in which she moved or into which he had drawn her. ""No good depending on Swann for this evening,"" people would say; ""don't you remember, it's his American's night at the Opera?"" He would secure invitations for her to the most exclusive drawing-rooms, to those houses where he himself went regularly, for weekly dinners or for poker; every evening, after a slight 'wave' imparted to his stiffly brushed red locks had tempered with a certain softness the ardour of his bold green eyes, he would select a flower for his buttonhole and set out to meet his mistress at the house of one or other of the women of his circle; and then, thinking of the affection and admiration which the fashionable folk, whom he always treated exactly as he pleased, would, when he met them there, lavish upon him in the presence of the woman whom he loved, he would find a fresh charm in that worldly existence of which he had grown weary, but whose substance, pervaded and warmly coloured by the flickering light which he had slipped into its midst, seemed to him beautiful and rare, now that he had incorporated in it a fresh love

   But while each of these attachments, each of these flirtations had been the realisation, more or less complete, of a dream born of the sight of a face or a form which Swann had spontaneously, and without effort on his part, found charming, it was quite another matter when, one day at the theatre, he was introduced to Odette de Crécy by an old friend of his own, who had spoken of her to him as a ravishing creature with whom he might very possibly come to an understanding; but had made her out to be harder of conquest than she actually was, so as to appear to be conferring a special favour by the introduction. She had struck Swann not, certainly, as being devoid of beauty, but as endowed with a style of beauty which left him indifferent, which aroused in him no desire, which gave him, indeed, a sort of physical repulsion; as one of those women of whom every man can name some, and each will name different examples, who are the converse of the type which our senses demand. To give him any pleasure her profile was too sharp, her skin too delicate, her cheek-bones too prominent, her features too tightly drawn. Her eyes were fine, but so large that they seemed to be bending beneath their own weight, strained the rest of her face and always made her appear unwell or in an ill humour. Some time after this introduction at the theatre she had written to ask Swann whether she might see his collections, which would interest her so much, she, ""an ignorant woman with a taste for beautiful things,"" saying that she would know him better when once she had seen him in his 'home,' where she imagined him to be ""so comfortable with his tea and his books""; although she had not concealed her surprise at his being in that part of the town, which must be so depressing, and was ""not nearly smart enough for such a very smart man."" And when he allowed her to come she had said to him as she left how sorry she was to have stayed so short a time in a house into which she was so glad to have found her way at last, speaking of him as though he had meant something more to her than the rest of the people she knew, and appearing to unite their two selves with a kind of romantic bond which had made him smile. But at the time of life, tinged already with disenchantment, which Swann was approaching, when a man can content himself with being in love for the pleasure of loving without expecting too much in return, this linking of hearts, if it is no longer, as in early youth, the goal towards which love, of necessity, tends, still is bound to love by so strong an association of ideas that it may well become the cause of love if it presents itself first. In his younger days a man dreams of possessing the heart of the woman whom he loves; later, the feeling that he possesses the heart of a woman may be enough to make him fall in love with her. And 50, at an age when it would appear—since one seeks in love before everything else a subjective pleasure—that the taste for feminine beauty must play the larger part in its procreation, love may come into being, love of the most physical order, without any foundation in desire. At this time of life a man has already been wounded more than once by the darts of love; it no longer evolves by itself, obeying its own incomprehensible and fatal laws, before his passive and astonished heart. We come to its aid; we falsify it by memory and by suggestion; recognising one of its symptoms we recall and recreate the rest. Since we possess its hymn, engraved on our hearts in its entirety, there is no need of any woman to repeat the opening lines, potent with the admiration which her beauty inspires, for us to remember all that follows. And if she begin in the middle, where it sings of our existing, henceforward, for one another only, we are well enough attuned to that music to be able to take it up and follow our partner, without hesitation, at the first pause in her voice

   Odette de Crécy came again to see Swann; her visits grew more frequent, and doubtless each visit revived the sense of disappointment which he felt at the sight of a face whose details he had somewhat forgotten in the interval, not remembering it as either so expressive or, in spite of her youth, so faded; he used to regret, while she was talking to him, that her really considerable beauty was not of the kind which he spontaneously admired. It must be remarked that Odette's face appeared thinner and more prominent than it actually was, because her forehead and the upper part of her cheeks, a single and almost plane surface, were covered by the masses of hair which women wore at that period, drawn forward in a fringe, raised in crimped waves and falling in stray locks over her ears; while as for her figure, and she was admirably built, it was impossible to make out its continuity (on account of the fashion then prevailing, and in spite of her being one of the best-dressed women in Paris) for the corset, jetting forwards in an arch, as though over an imaginary stomach, and ending in a sharp point, beneath which bulged out the balloon of her double skirts, gave a woman, that year, the appearance of being composed of different sections badly fitted together; to such an extent did the frills, the flounces, the inner bodice follow, in complete independence, controlled only by the fancy of their designer or the rigidity of their material, the line which led them to the knots of ribbon, falls of lace, fringes of vertically hanging jet, or carried them along the bust, but nowhere attached themselves to the living creature, who, according as the architecture of their fripperies drew them towards or away from her own, found herself either strait-laced to suffocation or else completely buried

   But, after Odette had left him, Swann would think with a smile of her telling him how the time would drag until he allowed her to come again; he remembered the anxious, timid way in which she had once begged him that it might not be very long, and the way in which she had looked at him then, fixing upon him her fearful and imploring gaze, which gave her a touching air beneath the bunches of artificial pansies fastened in the front of her round bonnet of white straw, tied with strings of black velvet. ""And won't you,"" she had ventured, ""come just once and take tea with me?"" He had pleaded pressure of work, an essay—which, in reality, he had abandoned years ago—on Vermeer of Delft. ""I know that I am quite useless,"" she had replied, ""a little wild thing like me beside a learned great man like you. I should be like the frog in the fable! And yet I should so much like to learn, to know things, to be initiated. What fun it would be to become a regular bookworm, to bury my nose in a lot of old papers!"" she had gone on, with that self-satisfied air which a smart woman adopts when she insists that her one desire is to give herself up, without fear of soiling her fingers, to some unclean task, such as cooking the dinner, with her ""hands right in the dish itself."" ""You will only laugh at me, but this painter who stops you from seeing me,"" she meant Vermeer, ""I have never even heard of him; is he alive still? Can I see any of his things in Paris, so as to have some idea of what is going on behind that great brow which works so hard, that head which I feel sure is always puzzling away about things; just to be able to say 'There, that's what he's thinking about!' What a dream it would be to be able to help you with your work.""

   He had sought an excuse in his fear of forming new friendships, which he gallantly described as his fear of a hopeless passion. ""You are afraid of falling in love? How funny that is, when I go about seeking nothing else, and would give my soul just to find a little love somewhere!"" she had said, so naturally and with such an air of conviction that he had been genuinely touched. ""Some woman must have made you suffer. And you think that the rest are all like her. She can't have understood you: you are so utterly different from ordinary men. That's what I liked about you when I first saw you; I felt at once that you weren't like everybody else.""

   ""And then, besides, there's yourself——"" he had continued, ""I know what women are; you must have a whole heap of things to do, and never any time to spare.""

   ""I? Why, I have never anything to do. I am always free, and I always will be free if you want me. At whatever hour of the day or night it may suit you to see me, just send for me, and I shall be only too delighted to come. Will you do that? Do you know what I should really like—to introduce you to Mme. Verdurin, where I go every evening. Just fancy my finding you there, and thinking that it was a little for my sake that you had gone.""

   No doubt, in thus remembering their conversations, in thinking about her thus when he was alone, he did no more than call her image into being among those of countless other women in his romantic dreams; but if, thanks to some accidental circumstance (or even perhaps without that assistance, for the circumstance which presents itself at the moment when a mental state, hitherto latent, makes itself felt, may well have had no influence whatsoever upon that state), the image of Odette de Crécy came to absorb the whole of his dreams, if from those dreams the memory of her could no longer be eliminated, then her bodily imperfections would no longer be of the least importance, nor would the conformity of her body, more or less than any other, to the requirements of Swann's taste; since, having become the body of her whom he loved, it must henceforth be the only one capable of causing him joy or anguish

   It so happened that my grandfather had known—which was more than could be said of any other actual acquaintance—the family of these Verdurins. But he had entirely severed his connection with what he called ""young Verdurin,"" taking a general view of him as one who had fallen—though without losing hold of his millions—among the riff-raff of Bohemia. One day he received a letter from Swann asking whether my grandfather could put him in touch with the Verdurins. ""On guard! on guard!"" he exclaimed as he read it, ""I am not at all surprised; Swann was bound to finish up like this. A nice lot of people! I cannot do what he asks, because, in the first place, I no longer know the gentleman in question. Besides, there must be a woman in it somewhere, and I don't mix myself up in such matters. Ah, well, we shall see some fun if Swann begins running after the little Verdurins.""

   And on my grandfather's refusal to act as sponsor, it was Odette herself who had taken Swann to the house

   The Verdurins had had dining with them, on the day when Swann made his first appearance, Dr. and Mme. Cottard, the young pianist and his aunt, and the painter then in favour, while these were joined, in the course of the evening, by several more of the 'faithful.'

   Dr. Cottard was never quite certain of the tone in which he ought to reply to any observation, or whether the speaker was jesting or in earnest. And so in any event he would embellish all his facial expressions with the offer of a conditional, a provisional smile whose expectant subtlety would exonerate him from the charge of being a simpleton, if the remark addressed to him should turn out to have been facetious. But as he must also be prepared to face the alternative, he never dared to allow this smile a definite expression on his features, and you would see there a perpetually flickering uncertainty, in which you might decipher the question that he never dared to ask: ""Do you really mean that?"" He was no more confident of the manner in which he ought to conduct himself in the street, or indeed in life generally, than he was in a drawing-room; and he might be seen greeting passers-by, carriages, and anything that occurred with a malicious smile which absolved his subsequent behaviour of all impropriety, since it proved, if it should turn out unsuited to the occasion, that he was well aware of that, and that if he had assumed a smile, the jest was a secret of his own

   On all those points, however, where a plain question appeared to him to be permissible, the Doctor was unsparing in his endeavours to cultivate the wilderness of his ignorance and uncertainty and so to complete his education

   So it was that, following the advice given him by a wise mother on his first coming up to the capital from his provincial home, he would never let pass either a figure of speech or a proper name that was new to him without an effort to secure the fullest information upon it

   As regards figures of speech, he was insatiable in his thirst for knowledge, for often imagining them to have a more definite meaning than was actually the case, he would want to know what, exactly, was intended by those which he most frequently heard used: 'devilish pretty,' 'blue blood,' 'a cat and dog life,' 'a day of reckoning,' 'a queen of fashion, 'to give a free hand,' 'to be at a deadlock,' and so forth; and in what particular circumstances he himself might make use of them in conversation. Failing these, he would adorn it with puns and other 'plays upon words' which he had learned by rote. As for the names of strangers which were uttered in his hearing, he used merely to repeat them to himself in a questioning tone, which, he thought, would suffice to furnish him with explanations for which he would not ostensibly seek

   As the critical faculty, on the universal application of which he prided himself, was, in reality, completely lacking, that refinement of good breeding which consists in assuring some one whom you are obliging in any way, without expecting to be believed, that it is really yourself that is obliged to him, was wasted on Cottard, who took everything that he heard in its literal sense. However blind she may have been to his faults, Mme. Verdurin was genuinely annoyed, though she still continued to regard him as brilliantly clever, when, after she had invited him to see and hear Sarah Bernhardt from a stage box, and had said politely: ""It is very good of you to have come, Doctor, especially as I'm sure you must often have heard Sarah Bernhardt; and besides, I'm afraid we're rather too near the stage,"" the Doctor, who had come into the box with a smile which waited before settling upon or vanishing from his face until some one in authority should enlighten him as to the merits of the spectacle, replied: ""To be sure, we are far too near the stage, and one is getting sick of Sarah Bernhardt. But you expressed a wish that I should come. For me, your wish is a command. I am only too glad to be able to do you this little service. What would one not do to please you, you are so good."" And he went on, ""Sarah Bernhardt; that's what they call the Voice of God, ain't it? You see, often, too, that she 'sets the boards on fire.' That's an odd expression, ain't it?"" in the hope of an enlightening commentary, which, however, was not forthcoming

   ""D'you know,"" Mme. Verdurin had said to her husband, ""I believe we are going the wrong way to work when we depreciate anything we offer the Doctor. He is a scientist who lives quite apart from our everyday existence; he knows nothing himself of what things are worth, and he accepts everything that we say as gospel.""

   ""I never dared to mention it,"" M. Verdurin had answered, ""but I've noticed the same thing myself."" And on the following New Year's Day, instead of sending Dr. Cottard a ruby that cost three thousand francs, and pretending that it was a mere trifle, M. Verdurin bought an artificial stone for three hundred, and let it be understood that it was something almost impossible to match

   When Mme. Verdurin had announced that they were to see M. Swann that evening; ""Swann!"" the Doctor had exclaimed in a tone rendered brutal by his astonishment, for the smallest piece of news would always take utterly unawares this man who imagined himself to be perpetually in readiness for anything. And seeing that no one answered him, ""Swann! Who on earth is Swann?"" he shouted, in a frenzy of anxiety which subsided as soon as Mme. Verdurin had explained, ""Why, Odette's friend, whom she told us about.""

   ""Ah, good, good; that's all right, then,"" answered the Doctor, at once mollified. As for the painter, he was overjoyed at the prospect of Swann's appearing at the Verdurins', because he supposed him to be in love with Odette, and was always ready to assist at lovers' meetings. ""Nothing amuses me more than match-making,"" he confided to Cottard; ""I have been tremendously successful, even with women!""

   In telling the Verdurins that Swann was extremely 'smart,' Odette had alarmed them with the prospect of another 'bore.' When he arrived, however, he made an excellent impression, an indirect cause of which, though they did not know it, was his familiarity with the best society. He had, indeed, one of those advantages which men who have lived and moved in the world enjoy over others, even men of intelligence and refinement, who have never gone into society, namely that they no longer see it transfigured by the longing or repulsion with which it fills the imagination, but regard it as quite unimportant. Their good nature, freed from all taint of snobbishness and from the fear of seeming too friendly, grown independent, in fact, has the ease, the grace of movement of a trained gymnast each of whose supple limbs will carry out precisely the movement that is required without any clumsy participation by the rest of his body. The simple and elementary gestures used by a man of the world when he courteously holds out his hand to the unknown youth who is being introduced to him, and when he bows discreetly before the Ambassador to whom he is being introduced, had gradually pervaded, without his being conscious of it, the whole of Swann's social deportment, so that in the company of people of a lower grade than his own, such as the Verdurins and their friends, he instinctively shewed an assiduity, and made overtures with which, by their account, any of their 'bores' would have dispensed. He chilled, though for a moment only, on meeting Dr. Cottard; for seeing him close one eye with an ambiguous smile, before they had yet spoken to one another (a grimace which Cottard styled ""letting 'em all come""), Swann supposed that the Doctor recognised him from having met him already somewhere, probably in some house of 'ill-fame,' though these he himself very rarely visited, never having made a habit of indulging in the mercenary sort of love. Regarding such an allusion as in bad taste, especially before Odette, whose opinion of himself it might easily alter for the worse, Swann assumed his most icy manner. But when he learned that the lady next to the Doctor was Mme. Cottard, he decided that so young a husband would not deliberately, in his wife's hearing, have made any allusion to amusements of that order, and so ceased to interpret the Doctor's expression in the sense which he had at first suspected. The painter at once invited Swann to visit his studio with Odette, and Swann found him very pleasant. ""Perhaps you will be more highly favoured than I have been,"" Mme. Verdurin broke in, with mock resentment of the favour, ""perhaps you will be allowed to see Cottard's portrait"" (for which she had given the painter a commission). ""Take care, Master Biche,"" she reminded the painter, whom it was a time-honoured pleasantry to address as 'Master,' ""to catch that nice look in his eyes, that witty little twinkle. You know, what I want to have most of all is his smile; that's what I've asked you to paint—the portrait of his smile."" And since the phrase struck her as noteworthy, she repeated it very loud, so as to make sure that as many as possible of her guests should hear it, and even made use of some indefinite pretext to draw the circle closer before she uttered it again. Swann begged to be introduced to everyone, even to an old friend of the Verdurins, called Saniette, whose shyness, simplicity and good-nature had deprived him of all the consideration due to his skill in palaeography, his large fortune, and the distinguished family to which he belonged. When he spoke, his words came with a confusion which was delightful to hear because one felt that it indicated not so much a defect in his speech as a quality of his soul, as it were a survival from the age of innocence which he had never wholly outgrown. All the consonants which he did not manage to pronounce seemed like harsh utterances of which his gentle lips were incapable. By asking to be made known to M. Saniette, Swann made M. Verdurin reverse the usual form of introduction (saying, in fact, with emphasis on the distinction: ""M. Swann, pray let me present to you our friend Saniette"") but he aroused in Saniette himself a warmth of gratitude, which, however, the Verdurins never disclosed to Swann, since Saniette rather annoyed them, and they did not feel bound to provide him with friends. On the other hand the Verdurins were extremely touched by Swann's next request, for he felt that he must ask to be introduced to the pianist's aunt. She wore a black dress, as was her invariable custom, for she believed that a woman always looked well in black, and that nothing could be more distinguished; but her face was exceedingly red, as it always was for some time after a meal. She bowed to Swann with deference, but drew herself up again with great dignity. As she was entirely uneducated, and was afraid of making mistakes in grammar and pronunciation, she used purposely to speak in an indistinct and garbling manner, thinking that if she should make a slip it would be so buried in the surrounding confusion that no one could be certain whether she had actually made it or not; with the result that her talk was a sort of continuous, blurred expectoration, out of which would emerge, at rare intervals, those sounds and syllables of which she felt positive. Swann supposed himself entitled to poke a little mild fun at her in conversation with M. Verdurin, who, however, was not at all amused

   ""She is such an excellent woman!"" he rejoined. ""I grant you that she is not exactly brilliant; but I assure you that she can talk most charmingly when you are alone with her.""

   ""I am sure she can,"" Swann hastened to conciliate him. ""All I meant was that she hardly struck me as 'distinguished,'"" he went on, isolating the epithet in the inverted commas of his tone, ""and, after all, that is something of a compliment.""

   ""Wait a moment,"" said M. Verdurin, ""now, this will surprise you; she writes quite delightfully. You have never heard her nephew play? It is admirable; eh, Doctor? Would you like me to ask him to play something, M. Swann?""

   ""I should count myself most fortunate..."" Swann was beginning, a trifle pompously, when the Doctor broke in derisively. Having once heard it said, and never having forgotten that in general conversation emphasis and the use of formal expressions were out of date, whenever he heard a solemn word used seriously, as the word 'fortunate' had been used just now by Swann, he at once assumed that the speaker was being deliberately pedantic. And if, moreover, the same word happened to occur, also, in what he called an old 'tag' or 'saw,' however common it might still be in current usage, the Doctor jumped to the conclusion that the whole thing was a joke, and interrupted with the remaining words of the quotation, which he seemed to charge the speaker with having intended to introduce at that point, although in reality it had never entered his mind

   ""Most fortunate for France!"" he recited wickedly, shooting up both arms with great vigour. M. Verdurin could not help laughing

   ""What are all those good people laughing at over there? There's no sign of brooding melancholy down in your corner,"" shouted Mme. Verdurin. ""You don't suppose I find it very amusing to be stuck up here by myself on the stool of repentance,"" she went on peevishly, like a spoiled child

   Mme. Verdurin was sitting upon a high Swedish chair of waxed pine-wood, which a violinist from that country had given her, and which she kept in her drawing-room, although in appearance it suggested a school 'form,' and 'swore,' as the saying is, at the really good antique furniture which she had besides; but she made a point of keeping on view the presents which her 'faithful' were in the habit of making her from time to time, so that the donors might have the pleasure of seeing them there when they came to the house. She tried to persuade them to confine their tributes to flowers and sweets, which had at least the merit of mortality; but she was never successful, and the house was gradually filled with a collection of foot-warmers, cushions, clocks, screens, barometers and vases, a constant repetition and a boundless incongruity of useless but indestructible objects

   From this lofty perch she would take her spirited part in the conversation of the 'faithful,' and would revel in all their fun; but, since the accident to her jaw, she had abandoned the effort involved in real hilarity, and had substituted a kind of symbolical dumb-show which signified, without endangering or even fatiguing her in any way, that she was 'laughing until she cried.' At the least witticism aimed by any of the circle against a 'bore,' or against a former member of the circle who was now relegated to the limbo of 'bores'—and to the utter despair of M. Verdurin, who had always made out that he was just as easily amused as his wife, but who, since his laughter was the 'real thing,' was out of breath in a moment, and so was overtaken and vanquished by her device of a feigned but continuous hilarity—she would utter a shrill cry, shut tight her little bird-like eyes, which were beginning to be clouded over by a cataract, and quickly, as though she had only just time to avoid some indecent sight or to parry a mortal blow, burying her face in her hands, which completely engulfed it, and prevented her from seeing anything at all, she would appear to be struggling to suppress, to eradicate a laugh which, were she to give way to it, must inevitably leave her inanimate. So, stupefied with the gaiety of the 'faithful,' drunken with comradeship, scandal and asseveration, Mme. Verdurin, perched on her high seat like a cage-bird whose biscuit has been steeped in mulled wine, would sit aloft and sob with fellow-feeling

   Meanwhile M. Verdurin, after first asking Swann's permission to light his pipe (""No ceremony here, you understand; we're all pals!""), went and begged the young musician to sit down at the piano

   ""Leave him alone; don't bother him; he hasn't come here to be tormented,"" cried Mme. Verdurin. ""I won't have him tormented.""

   ""But why on earth should it bother him?"" rejoined M. Verdurin. ""I'm sure M. Swann has never heard the sonata in F sharp which we discovered; he is going to play us the pianoforte arrangement.""

   ""No, no, no, not my sonata!"" she screamed, ""I don't want to be made to cry until I get a cold in the head, and neuralgia all down my face, like last time; thanks very much, I don't intend to repeat that performance; you are all very kind and considerate; it is easy to see that none of you will have to stay in bed, for a week.""

   This little scene, which was re-enacted as often as the young pianist sat down to play, never failed to delight the audience, as though each of them were witnessing it for the first time, as a proof of the seductive originality of the 'Mistress' as she was styled, and of the acute sensitiveness of her musical 'ear.' Those nearest to her would attract the attention of the rest, who were smoking or playing cards at the other end of the room, by their cries of 'Hear, hear!' which, as in Parliamentary debates, shewed that something worth listening to was being said. And next day they would commiserate with those who had been prevented from coming that evening, and would assure them that the 'little scene' had never been so amusingly done

   ""Well, all right, then,"" said M. Verdurin, ""he can play just the andante.""

   ""Just the andante! How you do go on,"" cried his wife. ""As if it weren't 'just the andante' that breaks every bone in my body. The 'Master' is really too priceless! Just as though, 'in the Ninth,' he said 'we need only have the finale,' or 'just the overture' of the Meistersinger.""

   The Doctor, however, urged Mme. Verdurin to let the pianist play, not because he supposed her to be malingering when she spoke of the distressing effects that music always had upon her, for he recognised the existence of certain neurasthenic states—but from his habit, common to many doctors, of at once relaxing the strict letter of a prescription as soon as it appeared to jeopardise, what seemed to him far more important, the success of some social gathering at which he was present, and of which the patient whom he had urged for once to forget her dyspepsia or headache formed an essential factor

   ""You won't be ill this time, you'll find,"" he told her, seeking at the same time to subdue her mind by the magnetism of his gaze. ""And, if you are ill, we will cure you.""

   ""Will you, really?"" Mme. Verdurin spoke as though, with so great a favour in store for her, there was nothing for it but to capitulate. Perhaps, too, by dint of saying that she was going to be ill, she had worked herself into a state in which she forgot, occasionally, that it was all only a 'little scene,' and regarded things, quite sincerely, from an invalid's point of view. For it may often be remarked that invalids grow weary of having the frequency of their attacks depend always on their own prudence in avoiding them, and like to let themselves think that they are free to do everything that they most enjoy doing, although they are always ill after doing it, provided only that they place themselves in the hands of a higher authority which, without putting them to the least inconvenience, can and will, by uttering a word or by administering a tabloid, set them once again upon their feet

   Odette had gone to sit on a tapestry-covered sofa near the piano, saying to Mme. Verdurin, ""I have my own little corner, haven't I?""

   And Mme. Verdurin, seeing Swann by himself upon a chair, made him get up. ""You're not at all comfortable there; go along and sit by Odette; you can make room for M. Swann there, can't you, Odette?""

   ""What charming Beauvais!"" said Swann, stopping to admire the sofa before he sat down on it, and wishing to be polite

   ""I am glad you appreciate my sofa,"" replied Mme. Verdurin, ""and I warn you that if you expect ever to see another like it you may as well abandon the idea at once. They never made any more like it. And these little chairs, too, are perfect marvels. You can look at them in a moment. The emblems in each of the bronze mouldings correspond to the subject of the tapestry on the chair; you know, you combine amusement with instruction when you look at them;—I can promise you a delightful time, I assure you. Just look at the little border around the edges; here, look, the little vine on a red background in this one, the Bear and the Grapes. Isn't it well drawn? What do you say? I think they knew a thing or two about design! Doesn't it make your mouth water, this vine? My husband makes out that I am not fond of fruit, because I eat less than he does. But not a bit of it, I am greedier than any of you, but I have no need to fill my mouth with them when I can feed on them with my eyes. What are you all laughing at now, pray? Ask the Doctor; he will tell you that those grapes act on me like a regular purge. Some people go to Fontainebleau for cures; I take my own little Beauvais cure here. But, M. Swann, you mustn't run away without feeling the little bronze mouldings on the backs. Isn't it an exquisite surface? No, no, not with your whole hand like that; feel them property!""

   ""If Mme. Verdurin is going to start playing about with her bronzes,"" said the painter, ""we shan't get any music to-night.""

   ""Be quiet, you wretch! And yet we poor women,"" she went on, ""are forbidden pleasures far less voluptuous than this. There is no flesh in the world as soft as these. None. When M. Verdurin did me the honour of being madly jealous... come, you might at least be polite. Don't say that you never have been jealous!""

   ""But, my dear, I have said absolutely nothing. Look here, Doctor, I call you as a witness; did I utter a word?""

   Swann had begun, out of politeness, to finger the bronzes, and did not like to stop

   ""Come along; you can caress them later; now it is you that are going to be caressed, caressed in the ear; you'll like that, I think. Here's the young gentleman who will take charge of that.""

   After the pianist had played, Swann felt and shewed more interest in him than in any of the other guests, for the following reason:

   The year before, at an evening party, he had heard a piece of music played on the piano and violin. At first he had appreciated only the material quality of the sounds which those instruments secreted. And it had been a source of keen pleasure when, below the narrow ribbon of the violin-part, delicate, unyielding, substantial and governing the whole, he had suddenly perceived, where it was trying to surge upwards in a flowing tide of sound, the mass of the piano-part, multiform, coherent, level, and breaking everywhere in melody like the deep blue tumult of the sea, silvered and charmed into a minor key by the moonlight. But at a given moment, without being able to distinguish any clear outline, or to give a name to what was pleasing him, suddenly enraptured, he had tried to collect, to treasure in his memory the phrase or harmony—he knew not which—that had just been played, and had opened and expanded his soul, just as the fragrance of certain roses, wafted upon the moist air of evening, has the power of dilating our nostrils. Perhaps it was owing to his own ignorance of music that he had been able to receive so confused an impression, one of those that are, notwithstanding, our only purely musical impressions, limited in their extent, entirely original, and irreducible into any other kind. An impression of this order, vanishing in an instant, is, so to speak, an impression sine materia. Presumably the notes which we hear at such moments tend to spread out before our eyes, over surfaces greater or smaller according to their pitch and volume; to trace arabesque designs, to give us the sensation of breadth or tenuity, stability or caprice. But the notes themselves have vanished before these sensations have developed sufficiently to escape submersion under those which the following, or even simultaneous notes have already begun to awaken in us. And this indefinite perception would continue to smother in its molten liquidity the motifs which now and then emerge, barely discernible, to plunge again and disappear and drown; recognised only by the particular kind of pleasure which they instil, impossible to describe, to recollect, to name; ineffable;—if our memory, like a labourer who toils at the laying down of firm foundations beneath the tumult of the waves, did not, by fashioning for us facsimiles of those fugitive phrases, enable us to compare and to contrast them with those that follow. And so, hardly had the delicious sensation, which Swann had experienced, died away, before his memory had furnished him with an immediate transcript, summary, it is true, and provisional, but one on which he had kept his eyes fixed while the playing continued, so effectively that, when the same impression suddenly returned, it was no longer uncapturable. He was able to picture to himself its extent, its symmetrical arrangement, its notation, the strength of its expression; he had before him that definite object which was no longer pure music, but rather design, architecture, thought, and which allowed the actual music to be recalled. This time he had distinguished, quite clearly, a phrase which emerged for a few moments from the waves of sound. It had at once held out to him an invitation to partake of intimate pleasures, of whose existence, before hearing it, he had never dreamed, into which he felt that nothing but this phrase could initiate him; and he had been filled with love for it, as with a new and strange desire

   With a slow and rhythmical movement it led him here, there, everywhere, towards a state of happiness noble, unintelligible, yet clearly indicated. And then, suddenly having reached a certain point from which he was prepared to follow it, after pausing for a moment, abruptly it changed its direction, and in a fresh movement, more rapid, multiform, melancholy, incessant, sweet, it bore him off with it towards a vista of joys unknown. Then it vanished. He hoped, with a passionate longing, that he might find it again, a third time. And reappear it did, though without speaking to him more clearly, bringing him, indeed, a pleasure less profound. But when he was once more at home he needed it, he was like a man into whose life a woman, whom he has seen for a moment passing by, has brought a new form of beauty, which strengthens and enlarges his own power of perception, without his knowing even whether he is ever to see her again whom he loves already, although he knows nothing of her, not even her name

   Indeed this passion for a phrase of music seemed, in the first few months, to be bringing into Swann's life the possibility of a sort of rejuvenation. He had so long since ceased to direct his course towards any ideal goal, and had confined himself to the pursuit of ephemeral satisfactions, that he had come to believe, though without ever formally stating his belief even to himself, that he would remain all his life in that condition, which death alone could alter. More than this, since his mind no longer entertained any lofty ideals, he had ceased to believe in (although he could not have expressly denied) their reality. He had grown also into the habit of taking refuge in trivial considerations, which allowed him to set on one side matters of fundamental importance. Just as he had never stopped to ask himself whether he would not have done better by not going into society, knowing very well that if he had accepted an invitation he must put in an appearance, and that afterwards, if he did not actually call, he must at least leave cards upon his hostess; so in his conversation he took care never to express with any warmth a personal opinion about a thing, but instead would supply facts and details which had a value of a sort in themselves, and excused him from shewing how much he really knew. He would be extremely precise about the recipe for a dish, the dates of a painter's birth and death, and the titles of his works. Sometimes, in spite of himself, he would let himself go so far as to utter a criticism of a work of art, or of some one's interpretation of life, but then he would cloak his words in a tone of irony, as though he did not altogether associate himself with what he was saying. But now, like a confirmed invalid whom, all of a sudden, a change of air and surroundings, or a new course of treatment, or, as sometimes happens, an organic change in himself, spontaneous and unaccountable, seems to have so far recovered from his malady that he begins to envisage the possibility, hitherto beyond all hope, of starting to lead—and better late than never—a wholly different life, Swann found in himself, in the memory of the phrase that he had heard, in certain other sonatas which he had made people play over to him, to see whether he might not, perhaps, discover his phrase among them, the presence of one of those invisible realities in which he had ceased to believe, but to which, as though the music had had upon the moral barrenness from which he was suffering a sort of recreative influence, he was conscious once again of a desire, almost, indeed, of the power to consecrate his life. But, never having managed to find out whose work it was that he had heard played that evening, he had been unable to procure a copy, and finally had forgotten the quest. He had indeed, in the course of the next few days, encountered several of the people who had been at the party with him, and had questioned them; but most of them had either arrived after or left before the piece was played; some had indeed been in the house, but had gone into another room to talk, and those who had stayed to listen had no clearer impression than the rest. As for his hosts, they knew that it was a recently published work which the musicians whom they had engaged for the evening had asked to be allowed to play; but, as these last were now on tour somewhere, Swann could learn nothing further. He had, of course, a number of musical friends, but, vividly as he could recall the exquisite and inexpressible pleasure which the little phrase had given him, and could see, still, before his eyes the forms that it had traced in outline, he was quite incapable of humming over to them the air. And so, at last, he ceased to think of it

   But to-night, at Mme. Verdurin's, scarcely had the little pianist begun to play when, suddenly, after a high note held on through two whole bars, Swann saw it approaching, stealing forth from underneath that resonance, which was prolonged and stretched out over it, like a curtain of sound, to veil the mystery of its birth—and recognised, secret, whispering, articulate, the airy and fragrant phrase that he had loved. And it was so peculiarly itself, it had so personal a charm, which nothing else could have replaced, that Swann felt as though he had met, in a friend's drawing-room, a woman whom he had seen and admired, once, in the street, and had despaired of ever seeing her again. Finally the phrase withdrew and vanished, pointing, directing, diligent among the wandering currents of its fragrance, leaving upon Swann's features a reflection of its smile. But now, at last, he could ask the name of his fair unknown (and was told that it was the andante movement of Vinteuil's sonata for the piano and violin), he held it safe, could have it again to himself, at home, as often as he would, could study its language and acquire its secret

   And so, when the pianist had finished, Swann crossed the room and thanked him with a vivacity which delighted Mme. Verdurin

   ""Isn't he charming?"" she asked Swann, ""doesn't he just understand it, his sonata, the little wretch? You never dreamed, did you, that a piano could be made to express all that? Upon my word, there's everything in it except the piano! I'm caught out every time I hear it; I think I'm listening to an orchestra. Though it's better, really, than an orchestra, more complete.""

   The young pianist bent over her as he answered, smiling and underlining each of his words as though he were making an epigram: ""You are most generous to me.""

   And while Mme. Verdurin was saying to her husband, ""Run and fetch him a glass of orangeade; it's well earned!"" Swann began to tell Odette how he had fallen in love with that little phrase. When their hostess, who was a little way off, called out, ""Well! It looks to me as though some one was saying nice things to you, Odette!"" she replied, ""Yes, very nice,"" and he found her simplicity delightful. Then he asked for some information about this Vinteuil; what else he had done, and at what period in his life he had composed the sonata;—what meaning the little phrase could have had for him, that was what Swann wanted most to know

   But none of these people who professed to admire this musician (when Swann had said that the sonata was really charming Mme. Verdurin had exclaimed, ""I quite believe it! Charming, indeed! But you don't dare to confess that you don't know Vinteuil's sonata; you have no right not to know it!""—and the painter had gone on with, ""Ah, yes, it's a very fine bit of work, isn't it? Not, of course, if you want something 'obvious,' something 'popular,' but, I mean to say, it makes a very great impression on us artists.""), none of them seemed ever to have asked himself these questions, for none of them was able to reply

   Even to one or two particular remarks made by Swann on his favourite phrase, ""D'you know, that's a funny thing; I had never noticed it; I may as well tell you that I don't much care about peering at things through a microscope, and pricking myself on pin-points of difference; no; we don't waste time splitting hairs in this house; why not? well, it's not a habit of ours, that's all,"" Mme. Verdurin replied, while Dr. Cottard gazed at her with open-mouthed admiration, and yearned to be able to follow her as she skipped lightly from one stepping-stone to another of her stock of ready-made phrases. Both he, however, and Mme. Cottard, with a kind of common sense which is shared by many people of humble origin, would always take care not to express an opinion, or to pretend to admire a piece of music which they would confess to each other, once they were safely at home, that they no more understood than they could understand the art of 'Master' Biche. Inasmuch as the public cannot recognise the charm, the beauty, even the outlines of nature save in the stereotyped impressions of an art which they have gradually assimilated, while an original artist starts by rejecting those impressions, so M. and Mme. Cottard, typical, in this respect, of the public, were incapable of finding, either in Vinteuil's sonata or in Biche's portraits, what constituted harmony, for them, in music or beauty in painting. It appeared to them, when the pianist played his sonata, as though he were striking haphazard from the piano a medley of notes which bore no relation to the musical forms to which they themselves were accustomed, and that the painter simply flung the colours haphazard upon his canvas. When, on one of these, they were able to distinguish a human form, they always found it coarsened and vulgarised (that is to say lacking all the elegance of the school of painting through whose spectacles they themselves were in the habit of seeing the people—real, living people, who passed them in the streets) and devoid of truth, as though M. Biche had not known how the human shoulder was constructed, or that a woman's hair was not, ordinarily, purple

   And yet, when the 'faithful' were scattered out of earshot, the Doctor felt that the opportunity was too good to be missed, and so (while Mme. Verdurin was adding a final word of commendation of Vinteuil's sonata) like a would-be swimmer who jumps into the water, so as to learn, but chooses a moment when there are not too many people looking on: ""Yes, indeed; he's what they call a musiciandi primo cartello!"" he exclaimed, with a sudden determination

   Swann discovered no more than that the recent publication of Vinteuil's sonata had caused a great stir among the most advanced school of musicians, but that it was still unknown to the general public

   ""I know some one, quite well, called Vinteuil,"" said Swann, thinking of the old music-master at Combray who had taught my grandmother's sisters

   ""Perhaps that's the man!"" cried Mme. Verdurin

   ""Oh, no!"" Swann burst out laughing. ""If you had ever seen him for a moment you wouldn't put the question.""

   ""Then to put the question is to solve the problem?"" the Doctor suggested

   ""But it may well be some relative,"" Swann went on. ""That would be bad enough; but, after all, there is no reason why a genius shouldn't have a cousin who is a silly old fool. And if that should be so, I swear there's no known or unknown form of torture I wouldn't undergo to get the old fool to introduce me to the man who composed the sonata; starting with the torture of the old fool's company, which would be ghastly.""

   The painter understood that Vinteuil was seriously ill at the moment, and that Dr. Potain despaired of his life

   ""What!"" cried Mme. Verdurin, ""Do people still call in Potain?""

   ""Ah! Mme. Verdurin,"" Cottard simpered, ""you forget that you are speaking of one of my colleagues—I should say, one of my masters.""

   The painter had heard, somewhere, that Vinteuil was threatened with the loss of his reason. And he insisted that signs of this could be detected in certain passages in the sonata. This remark did not strike Swann as ridiculous; rather, it puzzled him. For, since a purely musical work contains none of those logical sequences, the interruption or confusion of which, in spoken or written language, is a proof of insanity, so insanity diagnosed in a sonata seemed to him as mysterious a thing as the insanity of a dog or a horse, although instances may be observed of these

   ""Don't speak to me about 'your masters'; you know ten times as much as he does!"" Mme. Verdurin answered Dr. Cottard, in the tone of a woman who has the courage of her convictions, and is quite ready to stand up to anyone who disagrees with her. ""Anyhow, you don't kill your patients!""

   ""But, Madame, he is in the Academy."" The Doctor smiled with bitter irony. ""If a sick person prefers to die at the hands of one of the Princes of Science... It is far more smart to be able to say, 'Yes, I have Potain.'""

   ""Oh, indeed! More smart, is it?"" said Mme. Verdurin. ""So there are fashions, nowadays, in illness, are there? I didn't know that.... Oh, you do make me laugh!"" she screamed, suddenly, burying her face in her hands. ""And here was I, poor thing, talking quite seriously, and never seeing that you were pulling my leg.""

   As for M. Verdurin, finding it rather a strain to start laughing again over so small a matter, he was content with puffing out a cloud of smoke from his pipe, while he reflected sadly that he could never again hope to keep pace with his wife in her Atalanta-flights across the field of mirth

   ""D'you know; we like your friend so very much,"" said Mme. Verdurin, later, when Odette was bidding her good night. ""He is so unaffected, quite charming. If they're all like that, the friends you want to bring here, by all means bring them.""

   M. Verdurin remarked that Swann had failed, all the same, to appreciate the pianist's aunt

   ""I dare say he felt a little strange, poor man,"" suggested Mme. Verdurin. ""You can't expect him to catch the tone of the house the first time he comes; like Cottard, who has been one of our little 'clan' now for years. The first time doesn't count; it's just for looking round and finding out things. Odette, he understands all right, he's to join us to-morrow at the Châtelet. Perhaps you might call for him and bring him."" ""No, he doesn't want that.""

   ""Oh, very well; just as you like. Provided he doesn't fail us at the last moment.""

   Greatly to Mme. Verdurin's surprise, he never failed them. He would go to meet them, no matter where, at restaurants outside Paris (not that they went there much at first, for the season had not yet begun), and more frequently at the play, in which Mme. Verdurin delighted. One evening, when they were dining at home, he heard her complain that she had not one of those permits which would save her the trouble of waiting at doors and standing in crowds, and say how useful it would be to them at first-nights, and gala performances at the Opera, and what a nuisance it had been, not having one, on the day of Gambetta's funeral. Swann never spoke of his distinguished friends, but only of such as might be regarded as detrimental, whom, therefore, he thought it snobbish, and in not very good taste to conceal; while he frequented the Faubourg Saint-Germain he had come to include, in the latter class, all his friends in the official world of the Third Republic, and so broke in, without thinking: ""I'll see to that, all right. You shall have it in time for the Danicheff revival. I shall be lunching with the Prefect of Police to-morrow, as it happens, at the Elysée.""

   ""What's that? The Elysée?"" Dr. Cottard roared in a voice of thunder

   ""Yes, at M. Grévy's,"" replied Swann, feeling a little awkward at the effect which his announcement had produced

   ""Are you often taken like that?"" the painter asked Cottard, with mock-seriousness

   As a rule, once an explanation had been given, Cottard would say: ""Ah, good, good; that's all right, then,"" after which he would shew not the least trace of emotion. But this time Swann's last words, instead of the usual calming effect, had that of heating, instantly, to boiling-point his astonishment at the discovery that a man with whom he himself was actually sitting at table, a man who had no official position, no honours or distinction of any sort, was on visiting terms with the Head of the State

   ""What's that you say? M. Grévy? Do you know M. Grévy?"" he demanded of Swann, in the stupid and incredulous tone of a constable on duty at the palace, when a stranger has come up and asked to see the President of the Republic; until, guessing from his words and manner what, as the newspapers say, 'it is a case of,' he assures the poor lunatic that he will be admitted at once, and points the way to the reception ward of the police infirmary

   ""I know him slightly; we have some friends in common"" (Swann dared not add that one of these friends was the Prince of Wales). ""Anyhow, he is very free with his invitations, and, I assure you, his luncheon-parties are not the least bit amusing; they're very simple affairs, too, you know; never more than eight at table,"" he went on, trying desperately to cut out everything that seemed to shew off his relations with the President in a light too dazzling for the Doctor's eyes

   Whereupon Cottard, at once conforming in his mind to the literal interpretation of what Swann was saying, decided that invitations from M. Grévy were very little sought after, were sent out, in fact, into the highways and hedge-rows. And from that moment he never seemed at all surprised to hear that Swann, or anyone else, was 'always at the Elysée'; he even felt a little sorry for a man who had to go to luncheon-parties which, he himself admitted, were a bore

   ""Ah, good, good; that's quite all right then,"" he said, in the tone of a customs official who has been suspicious up to now, but, after hearing your explanations, stamps your passport and lets you proceed on your journey without troubling to examine your luggage

   ""I can well believe you don't find them amusing, those parties; indeed, it's very good of you to go to them!"" said Mme. Verdurin, who regarded the President of the Republic only as a 'bore' to be especially dreaded, since he had at his disposal means of seduction, and even of compulsion, which, if employed to captivate her 'faithful,' might easily make them 'fail.' ""It seems, he's as deaf as a post; and eats with his fingers.""

   ""Upon my word! Then it can't be much fun for you, going there."" A note of pity sounded in the Doctor's voice; and then struck by the number—only eight at table—""Are these luncheons what you would describe as 'intimate'?"" he inquired briskly, not so much out of idle curiosity as in his linguistic zeal

   But so great and glorious a figure was the President of the French Republic in the eyes of Dr. Cottard that neither the modesty of Swann nor the spite of Mme. Verdurin could ever wholly efface that first impression, and he never sat down to dinner with the Verdurins without asking anxiously, ""D'you think we shall see M. Swann here this evening? He is a personal friend of M. Grévy's. I suppose that means he's what you'd call a 'gentleman'?"" He even went to the length of offering Swann a card of invitation to the Dental Exhibition

   ""This will let you in, and anyone you take with you,"" he explained, ""but dogs are not admitted. I'm just warning you, you understand, because some friends of mine went there once, who hadn't been told, and there was the devil to pay.""

   As for M. Verdurin, he did not fail to observe the distressing effect upon his wife of the discovery that Swann had influential friends of whom he had never spoken

   If no arrangement had been made to 'go anywhere,' it was at the Verdurins' that Swann would find the 'little nucleus' assembled, but he never appeared there except in the evenings, and would hardly ever accept their invitations to dinner, in spite of Odette's entreaties

   ""I could dine with you alone somewhere, if you'd rather,"" she suggested

   ""But what about Mme. Verdurin?""

   ""Oh, that's quite simple. I need only say that my dress wasn't ready, or that my cab came late. There is always some excuse.""

   ""How charming of you.""

   But Swann said to himself that, if he could make Odette feel (by consenting to meet her only after dinner) that there were other pleasures which he preferred to that of her company, then the desire that she felt for his would be all the longer in reaching the point of satiety. Besides, as he infinitely preferred to Odette's style of beauty that of a little working girl, as fresh and plump as a rose, with whom he happened to be simultaneously in love, he preferred to spend the first part of the evening with her, knowing that he was sure to see Odette later on. For the same reason, he would never allow Odette to call for him at his house, to take him on to the Verdurins'. The little girl used to wait, not far from his door, at a street corner; Rémi, his coachman, knew where to stop; she would jump in beside him, and hold him in her arms until the carriage drew up at the Verdurins'. He would enter the drawing-room; and there, while Mme. Verdurin, pointing to the roses which he had sent her that morning, said: ""I am furious with you!"" and sent him to the place kept for him, by the side of Odette, the pianist would play to them—for their two selves, and for no one else—that little phrase by Vinteuil which was, so to speak, the national anthem of their love. He began, always, with a sustained tremolo from the violin part, which, for several bars, was unaccompanied, and filled all the foreground; until suddenly it seemed to be drawn aside, and—just as in those interiors by Pieter de Hooch, where the subject is set back a long way through the narrow framework of a half-opened door—infinitely remote, in colour quite different, velvety with the radiance of some intervening light, the little phrase appeared, dancing, pastoral, interpolated, episodic, belonging to another world. It passed, with simple and immortal movements, scattering on every side the bounties of its grace, smiling ineffably still; but Swann thought that he could now discern in it some disenchantment. It seemed to be aware how vain, how hollow was the happiness to which it shewed the way. In its airy grace there was, indeed, something definitely achieved, and complete in itself, like the mood of philosophic detachment which follows an outburst of vain regret. But little did that matter to him; he looked upon the sonata less in its own light—as what it might express, had, in fact, expressed to a certain musician, ignorant that any Swann or Odette, anywhere in the world, existed, when he composed it, and would express to all those who should hear it played in centuries to come—than as a pledge, a token of his love, which made even the Verdurins and their little pianist think of Odette and, at the same time, of himself—which bound her to him by a lasting tie; and at that point he had (whimsically entreated by Odette) abandoned the idea of getting some 'professional' to play over to him the whole sonata, of which he still knew no more than this one passage. ""Why do you want the rest?"" she had asked him. ""Our little bit; that's all we need."" He went farther; agonised by the reflection, at the moment when it passed by him, so near and yet so infinitely remote, that, while it was addressed to their ears, it knew them not, he would regret, almost, that it had a meaning of its own, an intrinsic and unalterable beauty, foreign to themselves, just as in the jewels given to us, or even in the letters written to us by a woman with whom we are in love, we find fault with the 'water' of a stone, or with the words of a sentence because they are not fashioned exclusively from the spirit of a fleeting intimacy and of a 'lass unparalleled.'

   It would happen, as often as not, that he had stayed so long outside, with his little girl, before going to the Verdurins' that, as soon as the little phrase had been rendered by the pianist, Swann would discover that it was almost time for Odette to go home. He used to take her back as far as the door of her little house in the Rue La Pérouse, behind the Arc de Triomphe. And it was perhaps on this account, and so as not to demand the monopoly of her favours, that he sacrificed the pleasure (not so essential to his well-being) of seeing her earlier in the evening, of arriving with her at the Verdurins', to the exercise of this other privilege, for which she was grateful, of their leaving together; a privilege which he valued all the more because, thanks to it, he had the feeling that no one else would see her, no one would thrust himself between them, no one could prevent him from remaining with her in spirit, after he had left her for the night

   And so, night after night, she would be taken home in Swann's carriage; and one night, after she had got down, and while he stood at the gate and murmured ""Till to-morrow, then!"" she turned impulsively from him, plucked a last lingering chrysanthemum in the tiny garden which flanked the pathway from the street to her house, and as he went back to his carriage thrust it into his hand. He held it pressed to his lips during the drive home, and when, in due course, the flower withered, locked it away, like something very precious, in a secret drawer of his desk

   He would escort her to her gate, but no farther. Twice only had he gone inside to take part in the ceremony—of such vital importance in her life—of 'afternoon tea.' The loneliness and emptiness of those short streets (consisting, almost entirely, of low-roofed houses, self-contained but not detached, their monotony interrupted here and there by the dark intrusion of some sinister little shop, at once an historical document and a sordid survival from the days when the district was still one of ill repute), the snow which had lain on the garden-beds or clung to the branches of the trees, the careless disarray of the season, the assertion, in this man-made city, of a state of nature, had all combined to add an element of mystery to the warmth, the flowers, the luxury which he had found inside

   Passing by (on his left-hand side, and on what, although raised some way above the street, was the ground floor of the house) Odette's bedroom, which looked out to the back over another little street running parallel with her own, he had climbed a staircase that went straight up between dark painted walls, from which hung Oriental draperies, strings of Turkish beads, and a huge Japanese lantern, suspended by a silken cord from the ceiling (which last, however, so that her visitors should not have to complain of the want of any of the latest comforts of Western civilisation, was lighted by a gas-jet inside), to the two drawing-rooms, large and small. These were entered through a narrow lobby, the wall of which, chequered with the lozenges of a wooden trellis such as you see on garden walls, only gilded, was lined from end to end by a long rectangular box in which bloomed, as though in a hothouse, a row of large chrysanthemums, at that time still uncommon, though by no means so large as the mammoth blossoms which horticulturists have since succeeded in making grow. Swann was irritated, as a rule, by the sight of these flowers, which had then been 'the rage' in Paris for about a year, but it had pleased him, on this occasion, to see the gloom of the little lobby shot with rays of pink and gold and white by the fragrant petals of these ephemeral stars, which kindle their cold fires in the murky atmosphere of winter afternoons. Odette had received him in a tea-gown of pink silk, which left her neck and arms bare. She had made him sit down beside her in one of the many mysterious little retreats which had been contrived in the various recesses of the room, sheltered by enormous palmtrees growing out of pots of Chinese porcelain, or by screens upon which were fastened photographs and fans and bows of ribbon. She had said at once, ""You're not comfortable there; wait a minute, I'll arrange things for you,"" and with a titter of laughter, the complacency of which implied that some little invention of her own was being brought into play, she had installed behind his head and beneath his feet great cushions of Japanese silk, which she pummelled and buffeted as though determined to lavish on him all her riches, and regardless of their value. But when her footman began to come into the room, bringing, one after another, the innumerable lamps which (contained, mostly, in porcelain vases) burned singly or in pairs upon the different pieces of furniture as upon so many altars, rekindling in the twilight, already almost nocturnal, of this winter afternoon, the glow of a sunset more lasting, more roseate, more human—filling, perhaps, with romantic wonder the thoughts of some solitary lover, wandering in the street below and brought to a standstill before the mystery of the human presence which those lighted windows at once revealed and screened from sight—she had kept an eye sharply fixed on the servant, to see whether he set each of the lamps down in the place appointed it. She felt that, if he were to put even one of them where it ought not to be, the general effect of her drawing-room would be destroyed, and that her portrait, which rested upon a sloping easel draped with plush, would not catch the light. And so, with feverish impatience, she followed the man's clumsy movements, scolding him severely when he passed too close to a pair of beaupots, which she made a point of always tidying herself, in case the plants should be knocked over—and went across to them now to make sure that he had not broken off any of the flowers. She found something 'quaint' in the shape of each of her Chinese ornaments, and also in her orchids, the cattleyas especially (these being, with chrysanthemums, her favourite flowers), because they had the supreme merit of not looking in the least like other flowers, but of being made, apparently, out of scraps of silk or satin. ""It looks just as though it had been cut out of the lining of my cloak,"" she said to Swann, pointing to an orchid, with a shade of respect in her voice for so 'smart' a flower, for this distinguished, unexpected sister whom nature had suddenly bestowed upon her, so far removed from her in the scale of existence, and yet so delicate, so refined, so much more worthy than many real women of admission to her drawing-room. As she drew his attention, now to the fiery-tongued dragons painted upon a bowl or stitched upon a fire-screen, now to a fleshy cluster of orchids, now to a dromedary of inlaid silver-work with ruby eyes, which kept company, upon her mantelpiece, with a toad carved in jade, she would pretend now to be shrinking from the ferocity of the monsters or laughing at their absurdity, now blushing at the indecency of the flowers, now carried away by an irresistible desire to run across and kiss the toad and dromedary, calling them 'darlings.' And these affectations were in sharp contrast to the sincerity of some of her attitudes, notably her devotion to Our Lady of the Laghetto who had once, when Odette was living at Nice, cured her of a mortal illness, and whose medal, in gold, she always carried on her person, attributing to it unlimited powers. She poured out Swann's tea, inquired ""Lemon or cream?"" and, on his answering ""Cream, please,"" went on, smiling, ""A cloud!"" And as he pronounced it excellent, ""You see, I know just how you like it."" This tea had indeed seemed to Swann, just as it seemed to her, something precious, and love is so far obliged to find some justification for itself, some guarantee of its duration in pleasures which, on the contrary, would have no existence apart from love and must cease with its passing, that when he left her, at seven o'clock, to go and dress for the evening, all the way home, sitting bolt upright in his brougham, unable to repress the happiness with which the afternoon's adventure had filled him, he kept on repeating to himself: ""What fun it would be to have a little woman like that in a place where one could always be certain of finding, what one never can be certain of finding, a really good cup of tea."" An hour or so later he received a note from Odette, and at once recognised that florid handwriting, in which an affectation of British stiffness imposed an apparent discipline upon its shapeless characters, significant, perhaps, to less intimate eyes than his, of an untidiness of mind, a fragmentary education, a want of sincerity and decision. Swann had left his cigarette-case at her house. ""Why,"" she wrote, ""did you not forget your heart also? I should never have let you have that back.""

   More important, perhaps, was a second visit which he paid her, a little later. On his way to the house, as always when he knew that they were to meet, he formed a picture of her in his mind; and the necessity, if he was to find any beauty in her face, of fixing his eyes on the fresh and rosy protuberance of her cheekbones, and of shutting out all the rest of those cheeks which were so often languorous and sallow, except when they were punctuated with little fiery spots, plunged him in acute depression, as proving that one's ideal is always unattainable, and one's actual happiness mediocre. He was taking her an engraving which she had asked to see. She was not very well; she received him, wearing a wrapper of mauve crêpe de Chine, which draped her bosom, like a mantle, with a richly embroidered web. As she stood there beside him, brushing his cheek with the loosened tresses of her hair, bending one knee in what was almost a dancer's pose, so that she could lean without tiring herself over the picture, at which she was gazing, with bended head, out of those great eyes, which seemed so weary and so sullen when there was nothing to animate her, Swann was struck by her resemblance to the figure of Zipporah, Jethro's Daughter, which is to be seen in one of the Sistine frescoes. He had always found a peculiar fascination in tracing in the paintings of the Old Masters, not merely the general characteristics of the people whom he encountered in his daily life, but rather what seems least susceptible of generalisation, the individual features of men and women whom he knew, as, for instance, in a bust of the Doge Loredan by Antonio Rizzo, the prominent cheekbones, the slanting eyebrows, in short, a speaking likeness to his own coachman Rémi; in the colouring of a Ghirlandaio, the nose of M. de Palancy; in a portrait by Tintoretto, the invasion of the plumpness of the cheek by an outcrop of whisker, the broken nose, the penetrating stare, the swollen eyelids of Dr. du Boulbon. Perhaps because he had always regretted, in his heart, that he had confined his attention to the social side of life, had talked, always, rather than acted, he felt that he might find a sort of indulgence bestowed upon him by those great artists, in his perception of the fact that they also had regarded with pleasure and had admitted into the canon of their works such types of physiognomy as give those works the strongest possible certificate of reality and trueness to life; a modern, almost a topical savour; perhaps, also, he had so far succumbed to the prevailing frivolity of the world of fashion that he felt the necessity of finding in an old masterpiece some such obvious and refreshing allusion to a person about whom jokes could be made and repeated and enjoyed to-day. Perhaps, on the other hand, he had retained enough of the artistic temperament to be able to find a genuine satisfaction in watching these individual features take on a more general significance when he saw them, uprooted and disembodied, in the abstract idea of similarity between an historic portrait and a modern original, whom it was not intended to represent. However that might be, and perhaps because the abundance of impressions which he, for some time past, had been receiving—though, indeed, they had come to him rather through the channel of his appreciation of music—had enriched his appetite for painting as well, it was with an unusual intensity of pleasure, a pleasure destined to have a lasting effect upon his character and conduct, that Swann remarked Odette's resemblance to the Zipporah of that Alessandro de Mariano, to whom one shrinks from giving his more popular surname, now that 'Botticelli' suggests not so much the actual work of the Master as that false and banal conception of it which has of late obtained common currency. He no longer based his estimate of the merit of Odette's face on the more or less good quality of her cheeks, and the softness and sweetness—as of carnation-petals—which, he supposed, would greet his lips there, should he ever hazard an embrace, but regarded it rather as a skein of subtle and lovely silken threads, which his gazing eyes collected and wound together, following the curving line from the skein to the ball, where he mingled the cadence of her neck with the spring of her hair and the droop of her eyelids, as though from a portrait of herself, in which her type was made clearly intelligible

   He stood gazing at her; traces of the old fresco were apparent in her face and limbs, and these he tried incessantly, afterwards, to recapture, both when he was with Odette, and when he was only thinking of her in her absence; and, albeit his admiration for the Florentine masterpiece was probably based upon his discovery that it had been reproduced in her, the similarity enhanced her beauty also, and rendered her more precious in his sight. Swann reproached himself with his failure, hitherto, to estimate at her true worth a creature whom the great Sandro would have adored, and counted himself fortunate that his pleasure in the contemplation of Odette found a justification in his own system of aesthetic. He told himself that, in choosing the thought of Odette as the inspiration of his dreams of ideal happiness, he was not, as he had until then supposed, falling back, merely, upon an expedient of doubtful and certainly inadequate value, since she contained in herself what satisfied the utmost refinement of his taste in art. He failed to observe that this quality would not naturally avail to bring Odette into the category of women whom he found desirable, simply because his desires had always run counter to his aesthetic taste. The words 'Florentine painting' were invaluable to Swann. They enabled him (gave him, as it were, a legal title) to introduce the image of Odette into a world of dreams and fancies which, until then, she had been debarred from entering, and where she assumed a new and nobler form. And whereas the mere sight of her in the flesh, by perpetually reviving his misgivings as to the quality of her face, her figure, the whole of her beauty, used to cool the ardour of his love, those misgivings were swept away and that love confirmed now that he could re-erect his estimate of her on the sure foundations of his aesthetic principles; while the kiss, the bodily surrender which would have seemed natural and but moderately attractive, had they been granted him by a creature of somewhat withered flesh and sluggish blood, coming, as now they came, to crown his adoration of a masterpiece in a gallery, must, it seemed, prove as exquisite as they would be supernatural

   And when he was tempted to regret that, for months past, he had done nothing but visit Odette, he would assure himself that he was not unreasonable in giving up much of his time to the study of an inestimably precious work of art, cast for once in a new, a different, an especially charming metal, in an unmatched exemplar which he would contemplate at one moment with the humble, spiritual, disinterested mind of an artist, at another with the pride, the selfishness, the sensual thrill of a collector

   On his study table, at which he worked, he had placed, as it were a photograph of Odette, a reproduction of Jethro's Daughter. He would gaze in admiration at the large eyes, the delicate features in which the imperfection of her skin might be surmised, the marvellous locks of hair that fell along her tired cheeks; and, adapting what he had already felt to be beautiful, on aesthetic grounds, to the idea of a living woman, he converted it into a series of physical merits which he congratulated himself on finding assembled in the person of one whom he might, ultimately, possess. The vague feeling of sympathy which attracts a spectator to a work of art, now that he knew the type, in warm flesh and blood, of Jethro's Daughter, became a desire which more than compensated, thenceforward, for that with which Odette's physical charms had at first failed to inspire him. When he had sat for a long time gazing at the Botticelli, he would think of his own living Botticelli, who seemed all the lovelier in contrast, and as he drew towards him the photograph of Zipporah he would imagine that he was holding Odette against his heart

   It was not only Odette's indifference, however, that he must take pains to circumvent; it was also, not infrequently, his own; feeling that, since Odette had had every facility for seeing him, she seemed no longer to have very much to say to him when they did meet, he was afraid lest the manner—at once trivial, monotonous, and seemingly unalterable—which she now adopted when they were together should ultimately destroy in him that romantic hope, that a day might come when she would make avowal of her passion, by which hope alone he had become and would remain her lover. And so to alter, to give a fresh moral aspect to that Odette, of whose unchanging mood he was afraid of growing weary, he wrote, suddenly, a letter full of hinted discoveries and feigned indignation, which he sent off so that it should reach her before dinner-time. He knew that she would be frightened, and that she would reply, and he hoped that, when the fear of losing him clutched at her heart, it would force from her words such as he had never yet heard her utter: and he was right—by repeating this device he had won from her the most affectionate letters that she had, so far, written him, one of them (which she had sent to him at midday by a special messenger from the Maison Dorée—it was the day of the Paris-Murcie Fête given for the victims of the recent floods in Murcia) beginning ""My dear, my hand trembles so that I can scarcely write——""; and these letters he had kept in the same drawer as the withered chrysanthemum. Or else, if she had not had time to write, when he arrived at the Verdurins' she would come running up to him with an ""I've something to say to you!"" and he would gaze curiously at the revelation in her face and speech of what she had hitherto kept concealed from him of her heart

   Even as he drew near to the Verdurins' door, and caught sight of the great lamp-lit spaces of the drawing-room windows, whose shutters were never closed, he would begin to melt at the thought of the charming creature whom he would see, as he entered the room, basking in that golden light. Here and there the figures of the guests stood out, sharp and black, between lamp and window, shutting off the light, like those little pictures which one sees sometimes pasted here and there upon a glass screen, whose other panes are mere transparencies. He would try to make out Odette. And then, when he was once inside, without thinking, his eyes sparkled suddenly with such radiant happiness that M. Verdurin said to the painter: ""H'm. Seems to be getting warm."" Indeed, her presence gave the house what none other of the houses that he visited seemed to possess: a sort of tactual sense, a nervous system which ramified into each of its rooms and sent a constant stimulus to his heart

   And so the simple and regular manifestations of a social organism, namely the 'little clan,' were transformed for Swann into a series of daily encounters with Odette, and enabled him to feign indifference to the prospect of seeing her, or even a desire not to see her; in doing which he incurred no very great risk since, even although he had written to her during the day, he would of necessity see her in the evening and accompany her home

   But one evening, when, irritated by the thought of that inevitable dark drive together, he had taken his other 'little girl' all the way to the Bois, so as to delay as long as possible the moment of his appearance at the Verdurins', he was so late in reaching them that Odette, supposing that he did not intend to come, had already left. Seeing the room bare of her, Swann felt his heart wrung by sudden anguish; he shook with the sense that he was being deprived of a pleasure whose intensity he began then for the first time to estimate, having always, hitherto, had that certainty of finding it whenever he would, which (as in the case of all our pleasures) reduced, if it did not altogether blind him to its dimensions

   ""Did you notice the face he pulled when he saw that she wasn't here?"" M. Verdurin asked his wife. ""I think we may say that he's hooked.""

   ""The face he pulled?"" exploded Dr. Cottard who, having left the house for a moment to visit a patient, had just returned to fetch his wife and did not know whom they were discussing

   ""D'you mean to say you didn't meet him on the doorstep—the loveliest of Swanns?""

   ""No. M. Swann has been here?""

   ""Just for a moment. We had a glimpse of a Swann tremendously agitated. In a state of nerves. You see, Odette had left.""

   ""You mean to say that she has gone the 'whole hog' with him; that she has 'burned her boats'?"" inquired the Doctor cautiously, testing the meaning of his phrases

   ""Why, of course not; there's absolutely nothing in it; in fact, between you and me, I think she's making a great mistake, and behaving like a silly little fool, which she is, incidentally.""

   ""Come, come, come!"" said M. Verdurin, ""How on earth do you know that there's 'nothing in it'? We haven't been there to see, have we now?""

   ""She would have told me,"" answered Mme. Verdurin with dignity. ""I may say that she tells me everything. As she has no one else at present, I told her that she ought to live with him. She makes out that she can't; she admits, she was immensely attracted by him, at first; but he's always shy with her, and that makes her shy with him. Besides, she doesn't care for him in that way, she says; it's an ideal love, 'Platonic,' you know; she's afraid of rubbing the bloom off—oh, I don't know half the things she says, how should I? And yet he's exactly the sort of man she wants.""

   ""I beg to differ from you,"" M. Verdurin courteously interrupted. ""I am only half satisfied with the gentleman. I feel that he 'poses.'""

   Mme. Verdurin's whole body stiffened, her eyes stared blankly as though she had suddenly been turned into a statue; a device by means of which she might be supposed not to have caught the sound of that unutterable word which seemed to imply that it was possible for people to 'pose' in her house, and, therefore, that there were people in the world who 'mattered more' than herself

   ""Anyhow, if there is nothing in it, I don't suppose it's because our friend believes in her virtue. And yet, you never know; he seems to believe in her intelligence. I don't know whether you heard the way he lectured her the other evening about Vinteuil's sonata. I am devoted to Odette, but really—to expound theories of aesthetic to her—the man must be a prize idiot.""

   ""Look here, I won't have you saying nasty things about Odette,"" broke in Mme. Verdurin in her 'spoiled child' manner. ""She is charming.""

   ""There's no reason why she shouldn't be charming; we are not saying anything nasty about her, only that she is not the embodiment of either virtue or intellect. After all,"" he turned to the painter, ""does it matter so very much whether she is virtuous or not? You can't tell; she might be a great deal less charming if she were.""

   On the landing Swann had run into the Verdurins' butler, who had been somewhere else a moment earlier, when he arrived, and who had been asked by Odette to tell Swann (but that was at least an hour ago) that she would probably stop to drink a cup of chocolate at Prévost's on her way home. Swann set off at once for Prévost's, but every few yards his carriage was held up by others, or by people crossing the street, loathsome obstacles each of which he would gladly have crushed beneath his wheels, were it not that a policeman fumbling with a note-book would delay him even longer than the actual passage of the pedestrian. He counted the minutes feverishly, adding a few seconds to each so as to be quite certain that he had not given himself short measure, and so, possibly, exaggerated whatever chance there might actually be of his arriving at Prévost's in time, and of finding her still there. And then, in a moment of illumination, like a man in a fever who awakes from sleep and is conscious of the absurdity of the dream-shapes among which his mind has been wandering without any clear distinction between himself and them, Swann suddenly perceived how foreign to his nature were the thoughts which he had been revolving in his mind ever since he had heard at the Verdurins' that Odette had left, how novel the heartache from which he was suffering, but of which he was only now conscious, as though he had just woken up. What! all this disturbance simply because he would not see Odette, now, till to-morrow, exactly what he had been hoping, not an hour before, as he drove toward Mme. Verdurin's. He was obliged to admit also that now, as he sat in the same carriage and drove to Prévost's, he was no longer the same man, was no longer alone even—but that a new personality was there beside him, adhering to him, amalgamated with him, a creature from whom he might, perhaps, be unable to liberate himself, towards whom he might have to adopt some such stratagem as one uses to outwit a master or a malady. And yet, during this last moment in which he had felt that another, a fresh personality was thus conjoined with his own, life had seemed, somehow, more interesting

   It was in vain that he assured himself that this possible meeting at Prévost's (the tension of waiting for which so ravished, stripped so bare the intervening moments that he could find nothing, not one idea, not one memory in his mind beneath which his troubled spirit might take shelter and repose) would probably, after all, should it take place, be much the same as all their meetings, of no great importance. As on every other evening, once he was in Odette's company, once he had begun to cast furtive glances at her changing countenance, and instantly to withdraw his eyes lest she should read in them the first symbols of desire and believe no more in his indifference, he would cease to be able even to think of her, so busy would he be in the search for pretexts which would enable him not to leave her immediately, and to assure himself, without betraying his concern, that he would find her again, next evening, at the Verdurins'; pretexts, that is to say, which would enable him to prolong for the time being, and to renew for one day more the disappointment, the torturing deception that must always come to him with the vain presence of this woman, whom he might approach, yet never dared embrace

   She was not at Prevost's; he must search for her, then, in every restaurant upon the boulevards. To save time, while he went in one direction, he sent in the other his coachman Rémi (Rizzo's Doge Loredan) for whom he presently—after a fruitless search—found himself waiting at the spot where the carriage was to meet him. It did not appear, and Swann tantalised himself with alternate pictures of the approaching moment, as one in which Rémi would say to him: ""Sir, the lady is there,"" or as one in which Rémi would say to him: ""Sir, the lady was not in any of the cafés."" And so he saw himself faced by the close of his evening—a thing uniform, and yet bifurcated by the intervening accident which would either put an end to his agony by discovering Odette, or would oblige him to abandon any hope of finding her that night, to accept the necessity of returning home without having seen her

   The coachman returned; but, as he drew up opposite him, Swann asked, not ""Did you find the lady?"" but ""Remind me, to-morrow, to order in some more firewood. I am sure we must be running short."" Perhaps he had persuaded himself that, if Rémi had at last found Odette in some café, where she was waiting for him still, then his night of misery was already obliterated by the realisation, begun already in his mind, of a night of joy, and that there was no need for him to hasten towards the attainment of a happiness already captured and held in a safe place, which would not escape his grasp again. But it was also by the force of inertia; there was in his soul that want of adaptability which can be seen in the bodies of certain people who, when the moment comes to avoid a collision, to snatch their clothes out of reach of a flame, or to perform any other such necessary movement, take their time (as the saying is), begin by remaining for a moment in their original position, as though seeking to find in it a starting-point, a source of strength and motion. And probably, if the coachman had interrupted him with, ""I have found the lady,"" he would have answered, ""Oh, yes, of course; that's what I told you to do. I had quite forgotten,"" and would have continued to discuss his supply of firewood, so as to hide from his servant the emotion that he had felt, and to give himself time to break away from the thraldom of his anxieties and abandon himself to pleasure

   The coachman came back, however, with the report that he could not find her anywhere, and added the advice, as an old and privileged servant, ""I think, sir, that all we can do now is to go home.""

   But the air of indifference which Swann could so lightly assume when Rémi uttered his final, unalterable response, fell from him like a cast-off cloak when he saw Rémi attempt to make him abandon hope and retire from the quest

   ""Certainly not!"" he exclaimed. ""We must find the lady. It is most important. She would be extremely put out—it's a business matter—and vexed with me if she didn't see me.""

   ""But I do not see how the lady can be vexed, sir,"" answered Rémi, ""since it was she that went away without waiting for you, sir, and said she was going to Prévost's, and then wasn't there.""

   Meanwhile the restaurants were closing, and their lights began to go out. Under the trees of the boulevards there were still a few people strolling to and fro, barely distinguishable in the gathering darkness. Now and then the ghost of a woman glided up to Swann, murmured a few words in his ear, asked him to take her home, and left him shuddering. Anxiously he explored every one of these vaguely seen shapes, as though among the phantoms of the dead, in the realms of darkness, he had been searching for a lost Eurydice

   Among all the methods by which love is brought into being, among all the agents which disseminate that blessed bane, there are few so efficacious as the great gust of agitation which, now and then, sweeps over the human spirit. For then the creature in whose company we are seeking amusement at the moment, her lot is cast, her fate and ours decided, that is the creature whom we shall henceforward love. It is not necessary that she should have pleased us, up till then, any more, or even as much as others. All that is necessary is that our taste for her should become exclusive. And that condition is fulfilled so soon as—in the moment when she has failed to meet us—for the pleasure which we were on the point of enjoying in her charming company is abruptly substituted an anxious torturing desire, whose object is the creature herself, an irrational, absurd desire, which the laws of civilised society make it impossible to satisfy and difficult to assuage—the insensate, agonising desire to possess her

   Swann made Rémi drive him to such restaurants as were still open; it was the sole hypothesis, now, of that happiness which he had contemplated so calmly; he no longer concealed his agitation, the price he set upon their meeting, and promised, in case of success, to reward his coachman, as though, by inspiring in him a will to triumph which would reinforce his own, he could bring it to pass, by a miracle, that Odette—assuming that she had long since gone home to bed,—might yet be found seated in some restaurant on the boulevards. He pursued the quest as far as the Maison Dorée, burst twice into Tortoni's and, still without catching sight of her, was emerging from the Café Anglais, striding with haggard gaze towards his carriage, which was waiting for him at the corner of the Boulevard des Italiens, when he collided with a person coming in the opposite direction; it was Odette; she explained, later, that there had been no room at Prévost's, that she had gone, instead, to sup at the Maison Dorée, and had been sitting there in an alcove where he must have overlooked her, and that she was now looking for her carriage

   She had so little expected to see him that she started back in alarm. As for him, he had ransacked the streets of Paris, not that he supposed it possible that he should find her, but because he would have suffered even more cruelly by abandoning the attempt. But now the joy (which, his reason had never ceased to assure him, was not, that evening at least, to be realised) was suddenly apparent, and more real than ever before; for he himself had contributed nothing to it by anticipating probabilities,—it remained integral and external to himself; there was no need for him to draw on his own resources to endow it with truth—'twas from itself that there emanated, 'twas itself that projected towards him that truth whose glorious rays melted and scattered like the cloud of a dream the sense of loneliness which had lowered over him, that truth upon which he had supported, nay founded, albeit unconsciously, his vision of bliss. So will a traveller, who has come down, on a day of glorious weather, to the Mediterranean shore, and is doubtful whether they still exist, those lands which he has left, let his eyes be dazzled, rather than cast a backward glance, by the radiance streaming towards him from the luminous and unfading azure at his feet

   He climbed after her into the carriage which she had kept waiting, and ordered his own to follow

   She had in her hand a bunch of cattleyas, and Swann could see, beneath the film of lace that covered her head, more of the same flowers fastened to a swansdown plume. She was wearing, under her cloak, a flowing gown of black velvet, caught up on one side so as to reveal a large triangular patch of her white silk skirt, with an 'insertion,' also of white silk, in the cleft of her low-necked bodice, in which were fastened a few more cattleyas. She had scarcely recovered from the shock which the sight of Swann had given her, when some obstacle made the horse start to one side. They were thrown forward from their seats; she uttered a cry, and fell back quivering and breathless

   ""It's all right,"" he assured her, ""don't be frightened."" And he slipped his arm round her shoulder, supporting her body against his own; then went on: ""Whatever you do, don't utter a word; just make a sign, yes or no, or you'll be out of breath again. You won't mind if I put the flowers straight on your bodice; the jolt has loosened them. I'm afraid of their dropping out; I'm just going to fasten them a little more securely.""

   She was not used to being treated with so much formality by men, and smiled as she answered: ""No, not at all; I don't mind in the least.""

   But he, chilled a little by her answer, perhaps, also, to bear out the pretence that he had been sincere in adopting the stratagem, or even because he was already beginning to believe that he had been, exclaimed: ""No, no; you mustn't speak. You will be out of breath again. You can easily answer in signs; I shall understand. Really and truly now, you don't mind my doing this? Look, there is a little—I think it must be pollen, spilt over your dress,—may I brush it off with my hand? That's not too hard; I'm not hurting you, am I? I'm tickling you, perhaps, a little; but I don't want to touch the velvet in case I rub it the wrong way. But, don't you see, I really had to fasten the flowers; they would have fallen out if I hadn't. Like that, now; if I just push them a little farther down.... Seriously, I'm not annoying you, am I? And if I just sniff them to see whether they've really lost all their scent? I don't believe I ever smelt any before; may I? Tell the truth, now.""

   Still smiling, she shrugged her shoulders ever so slightly, as who should say, ""You're quite mad; you know very well that I like it.""

   He slipped his other hand upwards along Odette's cheek; she fixed her eyes on him with that languishing and solemn air which marks the women of the old Florentine's paintings, in whose faces he had found the type of hers; swimming at the brink of her fringed lids, her brilliant eyes, large and finely drawn as theirs, seemed on the verge of breaking from her face and rolling down her cheeks like two great tears. She bent her neck, as all their necks may be seen to bend, in the pagan scenes as well as in the scriptural. And although her attitude was, doubtless, habitual and instinctive, one which she knew to be appropriate to such moments, and was careful not to forget to assume, she seemed to need all her strength to hold her face back, as though some invisible force were drawing it down towards Swann's. And Swann it was who, before she allowed her face, as though despite her efforts, to fall upon his lips, held it back for a moment longer, at a little distance between his hands. He had intended to leave time for her mind to overtake her body's movements, to recognise the dream which she had so long cherished and to assist at its realisation, like a mother invited as a spectator when a prize is given to the child whom she has reared and loves. Perhaps, moreover, Swann himself was fixing upon these features of an Odette not yet possessed, not even kissed by him, on whom he was looking now for the last time, that comprehensive gaze with which, on the day of his departure, a traveller strives to bear away with him in memory the view of a country to which he may never return

   But he was so shy in approaching her that, after this evening which had begun by his arranging her cattleyas and had ended in her complete surrender, whether from fear of chilling her, or from reluctance to appear, even retrospectively, to have lied, or perhaps because he lacked the audacity to formulate a more urgent requirement than this (which could always be repeated, since it had not annoyed her on the first occasion), he resorted to the same pretext on the following days. If she had any cattleyas pinned to her bodice, he would say: ""It is most unfortunate; the cattleyas don't need tucking in this evening; they've not been disturbed as they were the other night; I think, though, that this one isn't quite straight. May I see if they have more scent than the others?"" Or else, if she had none: ""Oh! no cattleyas this evening; then there's nothing for me to arrange."" So that for some time there was no change from the procedure which he had followed on that first evening, when he had started by touching her throat, with his fingers first and then with his lips, but their caresses began invariably with this modest exploration. And long afterwards, when the arrangement (or, rather, the ritual pretence of an arrangement) of her cattleyas had quite fallen into desuetude, the metaphor ""Do a cattleya,"" transmuted into a simple verb which they would employ without a thought of its original meaning when they wished to refer to the act of physical possession (in which, paradoxically, the possessor possesses nothing), survived to commemorate in their vocabulary the long forgotten custom from which it sprang. And yet possibly this particular manner of saying ""to make love"" had not the precise significance of its synonyms. However disillusioned we may be about women, however we may regard the possession of even the most divergent types as an invariable and monotonous experience, every detail of which is known and can be described in advance, it still becomes a fresh and stimulating pleasure if the women concerned be—or be thought to be—so difficult as to oblige us to base our attack upon some unrehearsed incident in our relations with them, as was originally for Swann the arrangement of the cattleyas. He trembled as he hoped, that evening, (but Odette, he told himself, if she were deceived by his stratagem, could not guess his intention) that it was the possession of this woman that would emerge for him from their large and richly coloured petals; and the pleasure which he already felt, and which Odette tolerated, he thought, perhaps only because she was not yet aware of it herself, seemed to him for that reason—as it might have seemed to the first man when he enjoyed it amid the flowers of the earthly paradise—a pleasure which had never before existed, which he was striving now to create, a pleasure—and the special name which he was to give to it preserved its identity—entirely individual and new

   The ice once broken, every evening, when he had taken her home, he must follow her into the house; and often she would come out again in her dressing-gown, and escort him to his carriage, and would kiss him before the eyes of his coachman, saying: ""What on earth does it matter what people see?"" And on evenings when he did not go to the Verdurins' (which happened occasionally, now that he had opportunities of meeting Odette elsewhere), when—more and more rarely—he went into society, she would beg him to come to her on his way home, however late he might be. The season was spring, the nights clear and frosty. He would come away from an evening party, jump into his victoria, spread a rug over his knees, tell the friends who were leaving at the same time, and who insisted on his going home with them, that he could not, that he was not going in their direction; then the coachman would start off at a fast trot without further orders, knowing quite well where he had to go. His friends would be left marvelling, and, as a matter of fact, Swann was no longer the same man. No one ever received a letter from him now demanding an introduction to a woman. He had ceased to pay any attention to women, and kept away from the places in which they were ordinarily to be met. In a restaurant, or in the country, his manner was deliberately and directly the opposite of that by which, only a few days earlier, his friends would have recognised him, that manner which had seemed permanently and unalterably his own. To such an extent does passion manifest itself in us as a temporary and distinct character, which not only takes the place of our normal character but actually obliterates the signs by which that character has hitherto been discernible. On the other hand, there was one thing that was, now, invariable, namely that wherever Swann might be spending the evening, he never failed to go on afterwards to Odette. The interval of space separating her from him was one which he must as inevitably traverse as he must descend, by an irresistible gravitation, the steep slope of life itself. To be frank, as often as not, when he had stayed late at a party, he would have preferred to return home at once, without going so far out of his way, and to postpone their meeting until the morrow; but the very fact of his putting himself to such inconvenience at an abnormal hour in order to visit her, while he guessed that his friends, as he left them, were saying to one another: ""He is tied hand and foot; there must certainly be a woman somewhere who insists on his going to her at all hours,"" made him feel that he was leading the life of the class of men whose existence is coloured by a love-affair, and in whom the perpetual sacrifice which they are making of their comfort and of their practical interests has engendered a spiritual charm. Then, though he may not consciously have taken this into consideration, the certainty that she was waiting for him, that she was not anywhere or with anyone else, that he would see her before he went home, drew the sting from that anguish, forgotten, it is true, but latent and ever ready to be reawakened, which he had felt on the evening when Odette had left the Verdurins' before his arrival, an anguish the actual cessation of which was so agreeable that it might even be called a state of happiness. Perhaps it was to that hour of anguish that there must be attributed the importance which Odette had since assumed in his life. Other people are, as a rule, so immaterial to us that, when we have entrusted to any one of them the power to cause so much suffering or happiness to ourselves, that person seems at once to belong to a different universe, is surrounded with poetry, makes of our lives a vast expanse, quick with sensation, on which that person and ourselves are ever more or less in contact. Swann could not without anxiety ask himself what Odette would mean to him in the years that were to come. Sometimes, as he looked up from his victoria on those fine and frosty nights of early spring, and saw the dazzling moonbeams fall between his eyes and the deserted streets, he would think of that other face, gleaming and faintly roseate like the moon's, which had, one day, risen on the horizon of his mind and since then had shed upon the world that mysterious light in which he saw it bathed. If he arrived after the hour at which Odette sent her servants to bed, before ringing the bell at the gate of her little garden, he would go round first into the other street, over which, at the ground-level, among the windows (all exactly alike, but darkened) of the adjoining houses, shone the solitary lighted window of her room. He would rap upon the pane, and she would hear the signal, and answer, before running to meet him at the gate. He would find, lying open on the piano, some of her favourite music, the Valse des Roses, the Pauvre Fou of Tagliafico (which, according to the instructions embodied in her will, was to be played at her funeral); but he would ask her, instead, to give him the little phrase from Vinteuil's sonata. It was true that Odette played vilely, but often the fairest impression that remains in our minds of a favourite air is one which has arisen out of a jumble of wrong notes struck by unskilful fingers upon a tuneless piano. The little phrase was associated still, in Swann's mind, with his love for Odette. He felt clearly that this love was something to which there were no corresponding external signs, whose meaning could not be proved by any but himself; he realised, too, that Odette's qualities were not such as to justify his setting so high a value on the hours he spent in her company. And often, when the cold government of reason stood unchallenged, he would readily have ceased to sacrifice so many of his intellectual and social interests to this imaginary pleasure. But the little phrase, as soon as it struck his ear, had the power to liberate in him the room that was needed to contain it; the proportions of Swann's soul were altered; a margin was left for a form of enjoyment which corresponded no more than his love for Odette to any external object, and yet was not, like his enjoyment of that love, purely individual, but assumed for him an objective reality superior to that of other concrete things. This thirst for an untasted charm, the little phrase would stimulate it anew in him, but without bringing him any definite gratification to assuage it. With the result that those parts of Swann's soul in which the little phrase had obliterated all care for material interests, those human considerations which affect all men alike, were left bare by it, blank pages on which he was at liberty to inscribe the name of Odette. Moreover, where Odette's affection might seem ever so little abrupt and disappointing, the little phrase would come to supplement it, to amalgamate with it its own mysterious essence. Watching Swann's face while he listened to the phrase, one would have said that he was inhaling an anaesthetic which allowed him to breathe more deeply. And the pleasure which the music gave him, which was shortly to create in him a real longing, was in fact closely akin, at such moments, to the pleasure which he would have derived from experimenting with perfumes, from entering into contract with a world for which we men were not created, which appears to lack form because our eyes cannot perceive it, to lack significance because it escapes our intelligence, to which we may attain by way of one sense only. Deep repose, mysterious refreshment for Swann,—for him whose eyes, although delicate interpreters of painting, whose mind, although an acute observer of manners, must bear for ever the indelible imprint of the barrenness of his life,—to feel himself transformed into a creature foreign to humanity, blinded, deprived of his logical faculty, almost a fantastic unicorn, a chimaera-like creature conscious of the world through his two ears alone. And as, notwithstanding, he sought in the little phrase for a meaning to which his intelligence could not descend, with what a strange frenzy of intoxication must he strip bare his innermost soul of the whole armour of reason, and make it pass, unattended, through the straining vessel, down into the dark filter of sound. He began to reckon up how much that was painful, perhaps even how much secret and unappeased sorrow underlay the sweetness of the phrase; and yet to him it brought no suffering. What matter though the phrase repeated that love is frail and fleeting, when his love was so strong! He played with the melancholy which the phrase diffused, he felt it stealing over him, but like a caress which only deepened and sweetened his sense of his own happiness. He would make Odette play him the phrase again, ten, twenty times on end, insisting that, while she played, she must never cease to kiss him. Every kiss provokes another. Ah, in those earliest days of love how naturally the kisses spring into life. How closely, in their abundance, are they pressed one against another; until lovers would find it as hard to count the kisses exchanged in an hour, as to count the flowers in a meadow in May. Then she would pretend to stop, saying: ""How do you expect me to play when you keep on holding me? I can't do everything at once. Make up your mind what you want; am I to play the phrase or do you want to play with me?"" Then he would become annoyed, and she would burst out with a laugh which, was transformed, as it left her lips, and descended upon him in a shower of kisses. Or else she would look at him sulkily, and he would see once again a face worthy to figure in Botticelli's 'Life of Moses,' he would place it there, giving to Odette's neck the necessary inclination; and when he had finished her portrait in distemper, in the fifteenth century, on the wall of the Sixtine, the idea that she was, none the less, in the room with him still, by the piano, at that very moment, ready to be kissed and won, the idea of her material existence, of her being alive, would sweep over him with so violent an intoxication that, with eyes starting from his head and jaws that parted as though to devour her, he would fling himself upon this Botticelli maiden and kiss and bite her cheeks. And then, as soon as he had left the house, not without returning to kiss her once again, because he had forgotten to take away with him, in memory, some detail of her fragrance or of her features, while he drove home in his victoria, blessing the name of Odette who allowed him to pay her these daily visits, which, although they could not, he felt, bring any great happiness to her, still, by keeping him immune from the fever of jealousy—by removing from him every possibility of a fresh outbreak of the heart-sickness which had manifested itself in him that evening, when he had failed to find her at the Verdurins'—might help him to arrive, without any recurrence of those crises, of which the first had been so distressing that it must also be the last, at the termination of this strange series of hours in his life, hours almost enchanted, in the same manner as these other, following hours, in which he drove through a deserted Paris by the light of the moon: noticing as he drove home that the satellite had now changed its position, relatively to his own, and was almost touching the horizon; feeling that his love, also, was obedient to these immutable laws of nature, he asked himself whether this period, upon which he had entered, was to last much longer, whether presently his mind's eye would cease to behold that dear countenance, save as occupying a distant and diminished position, and on the verge of ceasing to shed on him the radiance of its charm. For Swann was finding in things once more, since he had fallen in love, the charm that he had found when, in his adolescence, he had fancied himself an artist; with this difference, that what charm lay in them now was conferred by Odette alone. He could feel reawakening in himself the inspirations of his boyhood, which had been dissipated among the frivolities of his later life, but they all bore, now, the reflection, the stamp of a particular being; and during the long hours which he now found a subtle pleasure in spending at home, alone with his convalescent spirit, he became gradually himself again, but himself in thraldom to another

   He went to her only in the evenings, and knew nothing of how she spent her time during the day, any more than he knew of her past; so little, indeed, that he had not even the tiny, initial clue which, by allowing us to imagine what we do not know, stimulates a desire foreknowledge. And so he never asked himself what she might be doing, or what her life had been. Only he smiled sometimes at the thought of how, some years earlier, when he still did not know her, some one had spoken to him of a woman who, if he remembered rightly, must certainly have been Odette, as of a 'tart,' a 'kept' woman, one of those women to whom he still attributed (having lived but little in their company) the entire set of characteristics, fundamentally perverse, with which they had been, for many years, endowed by the imagination of certain novelists. He would say to himself that one has, as often as not, only to take the exact counterpart of the reputation created by the world in order to judge a person fairly, when with such a character he contrasted that of Odette, so good, so simple, so enthusiastic in the pursuit of ideals, so nearly incapable of not telling the truth that, when he had once begged her, so that they might dine together alone, to write to Mme. Verdurin, saying that she was unwell, the next day he had seen her, face to face with Mme. Verdurin, who asked whether she had recovered, blushing, stammering, and, in spite of herself, revealing in every feature how painful, what a torture it was to her to act a lie; and, while in her answer she multiplied the fictitious details of an imaginary illness, seeming to ask pardon, by her suppliant look and her stricken accents, for the obvious falsehood of her words

   On certain days, however, though these came seldom, she would call upon him in the afternoon, to interrupt his musings or the essay on Ver-meer to which he had latterly returned. His servant would come in to say that Mme. de Crécy was in the small drawing-room. He would go in search of her, and, when he opened the door, on Odette's blushing countenance, as soon as she caught sight of Swann, would appear—changing the curve of her lips, the look in her eyes, the moulding of her cheeks—an all-absorbing smile. Once he was left alone he would see again that smile, and her smile of the day before, another with which she had greeted him sometime else, the smile which had been her answer, in the carriage that night, when he had asked her whether she objected to his rearranging her cattleyas; and the life of Odette at all other times, since he knew nothing of it, appeared to him upon a neutral and colourless background, like those sheets of sketches by Watteau upon which one sees, here and there, in every corner and in all directions, traced in three colours upon the buff paper, innumerable smiles. But, once in a while, illuminating a chink of that existence which Swann still saw as a complete blank, even if his mind assured him that it was not so, because he was unable to imagine anything that might occupy it, some friend who knew them both, and suspecting that they were in love, had not dared to tell him anything about her that was of the least importance, would describe Odette's figure, as he had seen her, that very morning, going on foot up the Rue Abbattucci, in a cape trimmed with skunks, wearing a Rembrandt hat, and a bunch of violets in her bosom. This simple outline reduced Swann to utter confusion by enabling him suddenly to perceive that Odette had an existence which was not wholly subordinated to his own; he burned to know whom she had been seeking to fascinate by this costume in which he had never seen her; he registered a vow to insist upon her telling him where she had been going at that intercepted moment, as though, in all the colourless life—a life almost nonexistent, since she was then invisible to him—of his mistress, there had been but a single incident apart from all those smiles directed towards himself; namely, her walking abroad beneath a Rembrandt hat, with a bunch of violets in her bosom

   Except when he asked her for Vinteuil's little phrase instead of the Valse des Roses, Swann made no effort to induce her to play the things that he himself preferred, nor, in literature any more than in music, to correct the manifold errors of her taste. He fully realised that she was not intelligent. When she said how much she would like him to tell her about the great poets, she had imagined that she would suddenly get to know whole pages of romantic and heroic verse, in the style of the Vicomte de Borelli, only even more moving. As for Vermeer of Delft, she asked whether he had been made to suffer by a woman, if it was a woman that had inspired him, and once Swann had told her that no one knew, she had lost all interest in that painter. She would often say: ""I'm sure, poetry; well, of course, there'd be nothing like it if it was all true, if the poets really believed the things they said. But as often as not you'll find there's no one so mean and calculating as those fellows. I know something about poetry. I had a friend, once, who was in love with a poet of sorts. In his verses he never spoke of anything but love, and heaven, and the stars. Oh! she was properly taken in! He had more than three hundred thousand francs out of her before he'd finished."" If, then, Swann tried to shew her in what artistic beauty consisted, how one ought to appreciate poetry or painting, after a minute or two she would cease to listen, saying: ""Yes... I never thought it would be like that."" And he felt that her disappointment was so great that he preferred to lie to her, assuring her that what he had said was nothing, that he had only touched the surface, that he had not time to go into it all properly, that there was more in it than that. Then she would interrupt with a brisk, ""More in it? What?... Do tell me!"", but he did not tell her, for he realised how petty it would appear to her, and how different from what she had expected, less sensational and less touching; he was afraid, too, lest, disillusioned in the matter of art, she might at the same time be disillusioned in the greater matter of love

   With the result that she found Swann inferior, intellectually, to what she had supposed. ""You're always so reserved; I can't make you out."" She marvelled increasingly at his indifference to money, at his courtesy to everyone alike, at the delicacy of his mind. And indeed it happens, often enough, to a greater man than Swann ever was, to a scientist or artist, when he is not wholly misunderstood by the people among whom he lives, that the feeling in them which proves that they have been convinced of the superiority of his intellect is created not by any admiration for his ideas—for those are entirely beyond them—but by their respect for what they term his good qualities. There was also the respect with which Odette was inspired by the thought of Swann's social position, although she had no desire that he should attempt to secure invitations for herself. Perhaps she felt that such attempts would be bound to fail; perhaps, indeed, she feared lest, merely by speaking of her to his friends, he should provoke disclosures of an unwelcome kind. The fact remains that she had consistently held him to his promise never to mention her name. Her reason for not wishing to go into society was, she had told him, a quarrel which she had had, long ago, with another girl, who had avenged herself by saying nasty things about her. ""But,"" Swann objected, ""surely, people don't all know your friend."" ""Yes, don't you see, it's like a spot of oil; people are so horrid."" Swann was unable, frankly, to appreciate this point; on the other hand, he knew that such generalisations as ""People are so horrid,"" and ""A word of scandal spreads like a spot of oil,"" were generally accepted as true; there must, therefore, be cases to which they were literally applicable. Could Odette's case be one of these? He teased himself with the question, though not for long, for he too was subject to that mental oppression which had so weighed upon his father, whenever he was faced by a difficult problem. In any event, that world of society which concealed such terrors for Odette inspired her, probably, with no very great longing to enter it, since it was too far removed from the world which she already knew for her to be able to form any clear conception of it. At the same time, while in certain respects she had retained a genuine simplicity (she had, for instance, kept up a friendship with a little dressmaker, now retired from business, up whose steep and dark and fetid staircase she clambered almost every day), she still thirsted to be in the fashion, though her idea of it was not altogether that held by fashionable people. For the latter, fashion is a thing that emanates from a comparatively small number of leaders, who project it to a considerable distance—with more or less strength according as one is nearer to or farther from their intimate centre—over the widening circle of their friends and the friends of their friends, whose names form a sort of tabulated index. People 'in society' know this index by heart, they are gifted in such matters with an erudition from which they have extracted a sort of taste, of tact, so automatic in its operation that Swann, for example, without needing to draw upon his knowledge of the world, if he read in a newspaper the names of the people who had been guests at a dinner, could tell at once how fashionable the dinner had been, just as a man of letters, merely by reading a phrase, can estimate exactly the literary merit of its author. But Odette was one of those persons (an extremely numerous class, whatever the fashionable world may think, and to be found in every section of society) who do not share this knowledge, but imagine fashion to be something of quite another kind, which assumes different aspects according to the circle to which they themselves belong, but has the special characteristic—common alike to the fashion of which Odette used to dream and to that before which Mme. Cottard bowed—of being directly accessible to all. The other kind, the fashion of 'fashionable people,' is, it must be admitted, accessible also; but there are inevitable delays. Odette would say of some one: ""He never goes to any place that isn't really smart.""

   And if Swann were to ask her what she meant by that, she would answer, with a touch of contempt, ""Smart places! Why, good heavens, just fancy, at your age, having to be told what the smart places are in Paris! What do you expect me to say? Well, on Sunday mornings there's the Avenue de l'Impératrice, and round the lake at five o'clock, and on Thursdays the Eden-Théâtre, and the Hippodrome on Fridays; then there are the balls...""

   ""What balls?""

   ""Why, silly, the balls people give in Paris; the smart ones, I mean. Wait now, Herbinger, you know who I mean, the fellow who's in one of the jobbers' offices; yes, of course, you must know him, he's one of the best-known men in Paris, that great big fair-haired boy who wears such swagger clothes; he always has a flower in his buttonhole and a light-coloured overcoat with a fold down the back; he goes about with that old image, takes her to all the first-nights. Very well! He gave a ball the other night, and all the smart people in Paris were there. I should have loved to go! but you had to shew your invitation at the door, and I couldn't get one anywhere. After all, I'm just as glad, now, that I didn't go; I should have been killed in the crush, and seen nothing. Still, just to be able to say one had been to Herbinger's ball. You know how vain I am! However, you may be quite certain that half the people who tell you they were there are telling stories.... But I am surprised that you weren't there, a regular 'tip-topper' like you.""

   Swann made no attempt, however, to modify this conception of fashion; feeling that his own came no nearer to the truth, was just as fatuous, devoid of all importance, he saw no advantage to be gained by imparting it to his mistress, with the result that, after a few months, she ceased to take any interest in the people to whose houses he went, except when they were the means of his obtaining tickets for the paddock at race-meetings or first-nights at the theatre. She hoped that he would continue to cultivate such profitable acquaintances, but she had come to regard them as less smart since the day when she had passed the Marquise de Villeparisis in the street, wearing a black serge dress and a bonnet with strings

   ""But she looks like a pew-opener, like an old charwoman, darling! That a marquise! Goodness knows I'm not a marquise, but you'd have to pay me a lot of money before you'd get me to go about Paris rigged out like that!""

   Nor could she understand Swann's continuing to live in his house on the Quai d'Orléans, which, though she dared not tell him so, she considered unworthy of him

   It was true that she claimed to be fond of 'antiques,' and used to assume a rapturous and knowing air when she confessed how she loved to spend the whole day 'rummaging' in second-hand shops, hunting for 'bric-à-brac,' and things of the 'right date.' Although it was a point of honour, to which she obstinately clung, as though obeying some old family custom, that she should never answer any questions, never give any account of what she did during the daytime, she spoke to Swann once about a friend to whose house she had been invited, and had found that everything in it was 'of the period.' Swann could not get her to tell him what 'period' it was. Only after thinking the matter over she replied that it was 'mediaeval'; by which she meant that the walls were panelled. Some time later she spoke to him again of her friend, and added, in the hesitating but confident tone in which one refers to a person whom one has met somewhere, at dinner, the night before, of whom one had never heard until then, but whom one's hosts seemed to regard as some one so celebrated and important that one hopes that one's listener will know quite well who is meant, and will be duly impressed: ""Her dining-room... is... eighteenth century!"" Incidentally, she had thought it hideous, all bare, as though the house were still unfinished; women looked frightful in it, and it would never become the fashion. She mentioned it again, a third time, when she shewed Swann a card with the name and address of the man who had designed the dining-room, and whom she wanted to send for, when she had enough money, to see whether he could not do one for her too; not one like that, of course, but one of the sort she used to dream of, one which, unfortunately, her little house would not be large enough to contain, with tall sideboards, Renaissance furniture and fireplaces like the Château at Blois. It was on this occasion that she let out to Swann what she really thought of his abode on the Quai d'Orléans; he having ventured the criticism that her friend had indulged, not in the Louis XVI style, for, he went on, although that was not, of course, done, still it might be made charming, but in the 'Sham-Antique.'

   ""You wouldn't have her live, like you, among a lot of broken-down chairs and threadbare carpets!"" she exclaimed, the innate respectability of the middle-class housewife rising impulsively to the surface through the acquired dilettantism of the 'light woman.'

   People who enjoyed 'picking-up' things, who admired poetry, despised sordid calculations of profit and loss, and nourished ideals of honour and love, she placed in a class by themselves, superior to the rest of humanity. There was no need actually to have those tastes, provided one talked enough about them; when a man had told her at dinner that he loved to wander about and get his hands all covered with dust in the old furniture shops, that he would never be really appreciated in this commercial age, since he was not concerned about the things that interested it, and that he belonged to another generation altogether, she would come home saying: ""Why, he's an adorable creature; so sensitive! I had no idea,"" and she would conceive for him a strong and sudden friendship. But, on the other hand, men who, like Swann, had these tastes but did not speak of them, left her cold. She was obliged, of course, to admit that Swann was most generous with his money, but she would add, pouting: ""It's not the same thing, you see, with him,"" and, as a matter of fact, what appealed to her imagination was not the practice of disinterestedness, but its vocabulary

   Feeling that, often, he could not give her in reality the pleasures of which she dreamed, he tried at least to ensure that she should be happy in his company, tried not to contradict those vulgar ideas, that bad taste which she displayed on every possible occasion, which all the same he loved, as he could not help loving everything that came from her, which even fascinated him, for were they not so many more of those characteristic features, by virtue of which the essential qualities of the woman emerged, and were made visible? And so, when she was in a happy mood because she was going to see the Reine Topaze, or when her eyes grew serious, troubled, petulant, if she was afraid of missing the flower-show, or merely of not being in time for tea, with muffins and toast, at the Rue Royale tea-rooms, where she believed that regular attendance was indispensable, and set the seal upon a woman's certificate of 'smartness,' Swann, enraptured, as all of us are, at times, by the natural behaviour of a child, or by the likeness of a portrait, which appears to be on the point of speaking, would feel so distinctly the soul of his mistress rising to fill the outlines of her face that he could not refrain from going across and welcoming it with his lips. ""Oh, then, so little Odette wants us to take her to the flower-show, does she? she wants to be admired, does she? very well, we will take her there, we can but obey her wishes."" As Swann's sight was beginning to fail, he had to resign himself to a pair of spectacles, which he wore at home, when working, while to face the world he adopted a single eyeglass, as being less disfiguring. The first time that she saw it in his eye, she could not contain herself for joy: ""I really do think—for a man, that is to say—it is tremendously smart! How nice you look with it! Every inch a gentleman. All you want now is a title!"" she concluded, with a tinge of regret in her voice. He liked Odette to say these things, just as, if he had been in love with a Breton girl, he would have enjoyed seeing her in her coif and hearing her say that she believed in ghosts. Always until then, as is common among men whose taste for the fine arts develops independently of their sensuality, a grotesque disparity had existed between the satisfactions which he would accord to either taste simultaneously; yielding to the seduction of works of art which grew more and more subtle as the women in whose company he enjoyed them grew more illiterate and common, he would take a little servant-girl to a screened box in a theatre where there was some decadent piece which he had wished to see performed, or to an exhibition of impressionist painting, with the conviction, moreover, that an educated, 'society' woman would have understood them no better, but would not have managed to keep quiet about them so prettily. But, now that he was in love with Odette, all this was changed; to share her sympathies, to strive to be one with her in spirit was a task so attractive that he tried to find satisfaction in the things that she liked, and did find a pleasure, not only in copying her habits but in adopting her opinions, which was all the deeper because, as those habits and opinions sprang from no roots in her intelligence, they suggested to him nothing except that love, for the sake of which he had preferred them to his own. If he went again to Serge Panine, if he looked out for opportunities of going to watch Olivier Métra conducting, it was for the pleasure of being initiated into every one of the ideas in Odette's mind, of feeling that he had an equal share in all her tastes. This charm of drawing him closer to her, which her favourite plays and pictures and places possessed, struck him as being more mysterious than the intrinsic charm of more beautiful things and places, which appealed to him by their beauty, but without recalling her. Besides, having allowed the intellectual beliefs of his youth to grow faint, until his scepticism, as a finished 'man of the world,' had gradually penetrated them unawares, he held (or at least he had held for so long that he had fallen into the habit of saying) that the objects which we admire have no absolute value in themselves, that the whole thing is a matter of dates and castes, and consists in a series of fashions, the most vulgar of which are worth just as much as those which are regarded as the most refined. And as he had decided that the importance which Odette attached to receiving cards tot a private view was not in itself any more ridiculous than the pleasure which he himself had at one time felt in going to luncheon with the Prince of Wales, so he did not think that the admiration which she professed for Monte-Carlo or for the Righi was any more unreasonable than his own liking for Holland (which she imagined as ugly) and for Versailles (which bored her to tears). And so he denied himself the pleasure of visiting those places, consoling himself with the reflection that it was for her sake that he wished to feel, to like nothing that was not equally felt and liked by her

   Like everything else that formed part of Odette's environment, and was no more, in a sense, than the means whereby he might see and talk to her more often, he enjoyed the society of the Verdurins. With them, since, at the heart of all their entertainments, dinners, musical evenings, games, suppers in fancy dress, excursions to the country, theatre parties, even the infrequent 'big evenings' when they entertained 'bores,' there were the presence of Odette, the sight of Odette, conversation with Odette, an inestimable boon which the Verdurins, by inviting him to their house, bestowed on Swann, he was happier in the little 'nucleus' than anywhere else, and tried to find some genuine merit in each of its members, imagining that his tastes would lead him to frequent their society for the rest of his life. Never daring to whisper to himself, lest he should doubt the truth of the suggestion, that he would always be in love with Odette, at least when he tried to suppose that he would always go to the Verdurins' (a proposition which, a priori, raised fewer fundamental objections on the part of his intelligence), he saw himself for the future continuing to meet Odette every evening; that did not, perhaps, come quite to the same thing as his being permanently in love with her, but for the moment while he was in love with her, to feel that he would not, one day, cease to see her was all that he could ask. ""What a charming atmosphere!"" he said to himself. ""How entirely genuine life is to these people! They are far more intelligent, far more artistic, surely, than the people one knows. Mme. Verdurin, in spite of a few trifling exaggerations which are rather absurd, has a sincere love of painting and music! What a passion for works of art, what anxiety to give pleasure to artists! Her ideas about some of the people one knows are not quite right, but then their ideas about artistic circles are altogether wrong! Possibly I make no great intellectual demands upon conversation, but I am perfectly happy talking to Cottard, although he does trot out those idiotic puns. And as for the painter, if he is rather unpleasantly affected when he tries to be paradoxical, still he has one of the finest brains that I have ever come across. Besides, what is most important, one feels quite free there, one does what one likes without constraint or fuss. What a flow of humour there is every day in that drawing-room! Certainly, with a few rare exceptions, I never want to go anywhere else again. It will become more and more of a habit, and I shall spend the rest of my life among them.""

   And as the qualities which he supposed to be an intrinsic part of the Verdurin character were no more, really, than their superficial reflection of the pleasure which had been enjoyed in their society by his love for Odette, those qualities became more serious, more profound, more vital, as that pleasure increased. Since Mme. Verdurin gave Swann, now and then, what alone could constitute his happiness; since, on an evening when he felt anxious because Odette had talked rather more to one of the party than to another, and, in a spasm of irritation, would not take the initiative by asking her whether she was coming home, Mme. Verdurin brought peace and joy to his troubled spirit by the spontaneous exclamation: ""Odette! You'll see M. Swann home, won't you?""; since, when the summer holidays came, and after he had asked himself uneasily whether Odette might not leave Paris without him, whether he would still be able to see her every day, Mme. Verdurin was going to invite them both to spend the summer with her in the country; Swann, unconsciously allowing gratitude and self-interest to filter into his intelligence and to influence his ideas, went so far as to proclaim that Mme. Verdurin was ""a great and noble soul."" Should any of his old fellow-pupils in the Louvre school of painting speak to him of some rare or eminent artist, ""I'd a hundred times rather,"" he would reply, ""have the Verdurins."" And, with a solemnity of diction which was new in him: ""They are magnanimous creatures, and magnanimity is, after all, the one thing that matters, the one thing that gives us distinction here on earth. Look you, there are only two classes of men, the magnanimous, and the rest; and I have reached an age when one has to take sides, to decide once and for all whom one is going to like and dislike, to stick to the people one likes, and, to make up for the time one has wasted with the others, never to leave them again as long as one lives. Very well!"" he went on, with the slight emotion which a man feels when, even without being fully aware of what he is doing, he says something, not because it is true but because he enjoys saying it, and listens to his own voice uttering the words as though they came from some one else, ""The die is now cast; I have elected to love none but magnanimous souls, and to live only in an atmosphere of magnanimity. You ask me whether Mme. Verdurin is really intelligent. I can assure you that she has given me proofs of a nobility of heart, of a loftiness of soul, to which no one could possibly attain—how could they?—without a corresponding loftiness of mind. Without question, she has a profound understanding of art. But it is not, perhaps, in that that she is most admirable; every little action, ingeniously, exquisitely kind, which she has performed for my sake, every friendly attention, simple little things, quite domestic and yet quite sublime, reveal a more profound comprehension of existence than all your textbooks of philosophy.""

   * * *

   He might have reminded himself, all the same, that there were various old friends of his family who were just as simple as the Verdurins, companions of his early days who were just as fond of art, that he knew other 'great-hearted creatures,' and that, nevertheless, since he had cast his vote in favour of simplicity, the arts, and magnanimity, he had entirely ceased to see them. But these people did not know Odette, and, if they had known her, would never have thought of introducing her to him

   And so there was probably not, in the whole of the Verdurin circle, a single one of the 'faithful' who loved them, or believed that he loved them, as dearly as did Swann. And yet, when M. Verdurin said that he was not satisfied with Swann, he had not only expressed his own sentiments, he had unwittingly discovered his wife's. Doubtless Swann had too particular an affection for Odette, as to which he had failed to take Mme. Verdurin daily into his confidence; doubtless the very discretion with which he availed himself of the Verdurins' hospitality, refraining, often, from coming to dine with them for a reason which they never suspected, and in place of which they saw only an anxiety on his part not to have to decline an invitation to the house of some 'bore' or other; doubtless, also, and despite all the precautions which he had taken to keep it from them, the gradual discovery which they were making of his brilliant position in society—doubtless all these things contributed to their general annoyance with Swann. But the real, the fundamental reason was quite different. What had happened was that they had at once discovered in him a locked door, a reserved, impenetrable chamber in which he still professed silently to himself that the Princesse de Sagan was not grotesque, and that Cottard's jokes were not amusing; in a word (and for all that he never once abandoned his friendly attitude towards them all, or revolted from their dogmas), they had discovered an impossibility of imposing those dogmas upon him, of entirely converting him to their faith, the like of which they had never come across in anyone before. They would have forgiven his going to the houses of 'bores' (to whom, as it happened, in his heart of hearts he infinitely preferred the Verdurins and all their little 'nucleus') had he consented to set a good example by openly renouncing those 'bores' in the presence of the 'faithful.' But that was an abjuration which, as they well knew, they were powerless to extort

   What a difference was there in a 'newcomer' whom Odette had asked them to invite, although she herself had met him only a few times, and on whom they were building great hopes—the Comte de Forcheville! (It turned out that he was nothing more nor less than the brother-in-law of Saniette, a discovery which filled all the 'faithful' with amazement: the manners of the old palaeographer were so humble that they had always supposed him to be of a class inferior, socially, to their own, and had never expected to learn that he came of a rich and relatively aristocratic family.) Of course, Forcheville was enormously the 'swell,' which Swann was not or had quite ceased to be; of course, he would never dream of placing, as Swann now placed, the Verdurin circle above any other. But he lacked that natural refinement which prevented Swann from associating himself with the criticisms (too obviously false to be worth his notice) that Mme. Verdurin levelled at people whom he knew. As for the vulgar and affected tirades in which the painter sometimes indulged, the bag-man's pleasantries which Cottard used to hazard,—whereas Swann, who liked both men sincerely, could easily find excuses for these without having either the courage or the hypocrisy to applaud them, Forcheville, on the other hand, was on an intellectual level which permitted him to be stupified, amazed by the invective (without in the least understanding what it all was about), and to be frankly delighted by the wit. And the very first dinner at the Verdurins' at which Forcheville was present threw a glaring light upon all the differences between them, made his qualities start into prominence and precipitated the disgrace of Swann

   There was, at this dinner, besides the usual party, a professor from the Sorbonne, one Brichot, who had met M. and Mme. Verdurin at a watering-place somewhere, and, if his duties at the university and his other works of scholarship had not left him with very little time to spare, would gladly have come to them more often. For he had that curiosity, that superstitious outlook on life, which, combined with a certain amount of scepticism with regard to the object of their studies, earn for men of intelligence, whatever their profession, for doctors who do not believe in medicine, for schoolmasters who do not believe in Latin exercises, the reputation of having broad, brilliant, and indeed superior minds. He affected, when at Mme. Verdurin's, to choose his illustrations from among the most topical subjects of the day, when he spoke of philosophy or history, principally because he regarded those sciences as no more, really, than a preparation for life itself, and imagined that he was seeing put into practice by the 'little clan' what hitherto he had known only from books; and also, perhaps, because, having had drilled into him as a boy, and having unconsciously preserved, a feeling of reverence for certain subjects, he thought that he was casting aside the scholar's gown when he ventured to treat those subjects with a conversational licence, which seemed so to him only because the folds of the gown still clung

   Early in the course of the dinner, when M. de Forcheville, seated on the right of Mme. Verdurin, who, in the 'newcomer's' honour, had taken great pains with her toilet, observed to her: ""Quite original, that white dress,"" the Doctor, who had never taken his eyes off him, so curious was he to learn the nature and attributes of what he called a ""de,"" and was on the look-out for an opportunity of attracting his attention, so as to come into closer contact with him, caught in its flight the adjective 'blanche' and, his eyes still glued to his plate, snapped out, ""Blanche? Blanche of Castile?"" then, without moving his head, shot a furtive glance to right and left of him, doubtful, but happy on the whole. While Swann, by the painful and futile effort which he made to smile, testified that he thought the pun absurd, Forcheville had shewn at once that he could appreciate its subtlety, and that he was a man of the world, by keeping within its proper limits a mirth the spontaneity of which had charmed Mme. Verdurin

   ""What are you to say of a scientist like that?"" she asked Forcheville. ""You can't talk seriously to him for two minutes on end. Is that the sort of thing you tell them at your hospital?"" she went on, turning to the Doctor. ""They must have some pretty lively times there, if that's the case. I can see that I shall have to get taken in as a patient!""

   ""I think I heard the Doctor speak of that wicked old humbug, Blanche of Castile, if I may so express myself. Am I not right, Madame?"" Brichot appealed to Mme. Verdurin, who, swooning with merriment, her eyes tightly closed, had buried her face in her two hands, from between which, now and then, escaped a muffled scream

   ""Good gracious, Madame, I would not dream of shocking the reverent-minded, if there are any such around this table, sub rosa... I recognise, moreover, that our ineffable and Athenian—oh, how infinitely Athenian—Republic is capable of honouring, in the person of that obscurantist old she-Capet, the first of our chiefs of police. Yes, indeed, my dear host, yes, indeed!"" he repeated in his ringing voice, which sounded a separate note for each syllable, in reply to a protest by M. Verdurin. ""The Chronicle of Saint Denis, and the authenticity of its information is beyond question, leaves us no room for doubt on that point. No one could be more fitly chosen as Patron by a secularising proletariat than that mother of a Saint, who let him see some pretty fishy saints besides, as Suger says, and other great St. Bernards of the sort; for with her it was a case of taking just what you pleased.""

   ""Who is that gentleman?"" Forcheville asked Mme. Verdurin. ""He seems to speak with great authority.""

   ""What! Do you mean to say you don't know the famous Brichot? Why, he's celebrated all over Europe.""

   ""Oh, that's Bréchot, is it?"" exclaimed Forcheville, who had not quite caught the name. ""You must tell me all about him""; he went on, fastening a pair of goggle eyes on the celebrity. ""It's always interesting to meet well-known people at dinner. But, I say, you ask us to very select parties here. No dull evenings in this house, I'm sure.""

   ""Well, you know what it is really,"" said Mme. Verdurin modestly. ""They feel safe here. They can talk about whatever they like, and the conversation goes off like fireworks. Now Brichot, this evening, is nothing. I've seen him, don't you know, when he's been with me, simply dazzling; you'd want to go on your knees to him. Well, with anyone else he's not the same man, he's not in the least witty, you have to drag the words out of him, he's even boring.""

   ""That's strange,"" remarked Forcheville with fitting astonishment

   A sort of wit like Brichot's would have been regarded as out-and-out stupidity by the people among whom Swann had spent his early life, for all that it is quite compatible with real intelligence. And the intelligence of the Professor's vigorous and well-nourished brain might easily have been envied by many of the people in society who seemed witty enough to Swann. But these last had so thoroughly inculcated into him their likes and dislikes, at least in everything that pertained to their ordinary social existence, including that annex to social existence which belongs, strictly speaking, to the domain of intelligence, namely, conversation, that Swann could not see anything in Brichot's pleasantries; to him they were merely pedantic, vulgar, and disgustingly coarse. He was shocked, too, being accustomed to good manners, by the rude, almost barrack-room tone which this student-in-arms adopted, no matter to whom he was speaking. Finally, perhaps, he had lost all patience that evening as he watched Mme. Verdurin welcoming, with such unnecessary warmth, this Forcheville fellow, whom it had been Odette's unaccountable idea to bring to the house. Feeling a little awkward, with Swann there also, she had asked him on her arrival: ""What do you think of my guest?""

   And he, suddenly realising for the first time that Forcheville, whom he had known for years, could actually attract a woman, and was quite a good specimen of a man, had retorted: ""Beastly!"" He had, certainly, no idea of being jealous of Odette, but did not feel quite so happy as usual, and when Brichot, having begun to tell them the story of Blanche of Castile's mother, who, according to him, ""had been with Henry Plantagenet for years before they were married,"" tried to prompt Swann to beg him to continue the story, by interjecting ""Isn't that so, M. Swann?"" in the martial accents which one uses in order to get down to the level of an unintelligent rustic or to put the 'fear of God' into a trooper, Swann cut his story short, to the intense fury of their hostess, by begging to be excused for taking so little interest in Blanche of Castile, as he had something that he wished to ask the painter. He, it appeared, had been that afternoon to an exhibition of the work of another artist, also a friend of Mme. Verdurin, who had recently died, and Swann wished to find out from him (for he valued his discrimination) whether there had really been anything more in this later work than the virtuosity which had struck people so forcibly in his earlier exhibitions

   ""From that point of view it was extraordinary, but it did not seem to me to be a form of art which you could call 'elevated,'"" said Swann with a smile

   ""Elevated... to the height of an Institute!"" interrupted Cottard, raising his arms with mock solemnity. The whole table burst out laughing

   ""What did I tell you?"" said Mme. Verdurin to Forcheville. ""It's simply impossible to be serious with him. When you least expect it, out he comes with a joke.""

   But she observed that Swann, and Swann alone, had not unbent. For one thing he was none too well pleased with Cottard for having secured a laugh at his expense in front of Forcheville. But the painter, instead of replying in a way that might have interested Swann, as he would probably have done had they been alone together, preferred to win the easy admiration of the rest by exercising his wit upon the talent of their dead friend

   ""I went up to one of them,"" he began, ""just to see how it was done; I stuck my nose into it. Yes, I don't think! Impossible to say whether it was done with glue, with soap, with sealing-wax, with sunshine, with leaven, with excrem...""

   ""And one make twelve!"" shouted the Doctor, wittily, but just too late, for no one saw the point of his interruption

   ""It looks as though it were done with nothing at all,"" resumed the painter. ""No more chance of discovering the trick than there is in the 'Night Watch,' or the 'Regents,' and it's even bigger work than either Rembrandt or Hals ever did. It's all there,—and yet, no, I'll take my oath it isn't.""

   Then, just as singers who have reached the highest note in their compass, proceed to hum the rest of the air in falsetto, he had to be satisfied with murmuring, smiling the while, as if, after all, there had been something irresistibly amusing in the sheer beauty of the painting: ""It smells all right; it makes your head go round; it catches your breath; you feel ticklish all over—and not the faintest clue to how it's done. The man's a sorcerer; the thing's a conjuring-trick, it's a miracle,"" bursting outright into laughter, ""it's dishonest!"" Then stopping, solemnly raising his head, pitching his voice on a double-bass note which he struggled to bring into harmony, he concluded, ""And it's so loyal!""

   Except at the moment when he had called it ""bigger than the 'Night Watch,'"" a blasphemy which had called forth an instant protest from Mme. Verdurin, who regarded the 'Night Watch' as the supreme masterpiece of the universe (conjointly with the 'Ninth' and the 'Samothrace'), and at the word ""excrement,"" which had made Forcheville throw a sweeping glance round the table to see whether it was 'all right,' before he allowed his lips to curve in a prudish and conciliatory smile, all the party (save Swann) had kept their fascinated and adoring eyes fixed upon the painter

   ""I do so love him when he goes up in the air like that!"" cried Mme. Verdurin, the moment that he had finished, enraptured that the table-talk should have proved so entertaining on the very night that Forcheville was dining with them for the first time. ""Hallo, you!"" she turned to her husband, ""what's the matter with you, sitting there gaping like a great animal? You know, though, don't you,"" she apologised for him to the painter, ""that he can talk quite well when he chooses; anybody would think it was the first time he had ever listened to you. If you had only seen him while you were speaking; he was just drinking it all in. And to-morrow he will tell us everything you said, without missing a word.""

   ""No, really, I'm not joking!"" protested the painter, enchanted by the success of his speech. ""You all look as if you thought I was pulling your legs, that it was just a trick. I'll take you to see the show, and then you can say whether I've been exaggerating; I'll bet you anything you like, you'll come away more 'up in the air' than I am!""

   ""But we don't suppose for a moment that you're exaggerating; we only want you to go on with your dinner, and my husband too. Give M. Biche some more sole, can't you see his has got cold? We're not in any hurry; you're dashing round as if the house was on fire. Wait a little; don't serve the salad just yet.""

   Mme. Cottard, who was a shy woman and spoke but seldom, was not lacking, for all that, in self-assurance when a happy inspiration put the right word in her mouth. She felt that it would be well received; the thought gave her confidence, and what she was doing was done with the object not so much of shining herself, as of helping her husband on in his career. And so she did not allow the word 'salad,' which Mme. Verdurin had just uttered, to pass unchallenged

   ""It's not a Japanese salad, is it?"" she whispered, turning towards Odette

   And then, in her joy and confusion at the combination of neatness and daring which there had been in making so discreet and yet so unmistakable an allusion to the new and brilliantly successful play by Dumas, she broke down in a charming, girlish laugh, not very loud, but so irresistible that it was some time before she could control it

   ""Who is that lady? She seems devilish clever,"" said Forcheville

   ""No, it is not. But we will have one for you if you will all come to dinner on Friday.""

   ""You will think me dreadfully provincial, sir,"" said Mme. Cottard to Swann, ""but, do you know, I haven't been yet to this famous Francillon that everybody's talking about. The Doctor has been (I remember now, he told me what a very great pleasure it had been to him to spend the evening with you there) and I must confess, I don't see much sense in spending money on seats for him to take me, when he's seen the play already. Of course an evening at the Théâtre-Français is never wasted, really; the acting's so good there always; but we have some very nice friends,"" (Mme. Cottard would hardly ever utter a proper name, but restricted herself to ""some friends of ours"" or ""one of my friends,"" as being more 'distinguished,' speaking in an affected tone and with all the importance of a person who need give names only when she chooses) ""who often have a box, and are kind enough to take us to all the new pieces that are worth going to, and so I'm certain to see this Francillon sooner or later, and then I shall know what to think. But I do feel such a fool about it, I must confess, for, whenever I pay a call anywhere, I find everybody talking—it's only natural—about that wretched Japanese salad. Really and truly, one's beginning to get just a little tired of hearing about it,"" she went on, seeing that Swann seemed less interested than she had hoped in so burning a topic. ""I must admit, though, that it's sometimes quite amusing, the way they joke about it: I've got a friend, now, who is most original, though she's really a beautiful woman, most popular in society, goes everywhere, and she tells me that she got her cook to make one of these Japanese salads, putting in everything that young M. Dumas says you're to put in, in the play. Then she asked just a few friends to come and taste it. I was not among the favoured few, I'm sorry to say. But she told us all about it on her next 'day'; it seems it was quite horrible, she made us all laugh till we cried. I don't know; perhaps it was the way she told it,"" Mme. Cottard added doubtfully, seeing that Swann still looked grave

   And, imagining that it was, perhaps, because he had not been amused by Francillon: ""Well, I daresay I shall be disappointed with it, after all. I don't suppose it's as good as the piece Mme. de Crécy worships, Serge Panine. There's a play, if you like; so deep, makes you think! But just fancy giving a receipt for a salad on the stage of the Théâtre-Français! Now, Serge Panine—! But then, it's like everything that comes from the pen of M. Georges Ohnet, it's so well written. I wonder if you know the Maître des Forges, which I like even better than Serge Panine.""

   ""Pardon me,"" said Swann with polite irony, ""but I can assure you that my want of admiration is almost equally divided between those masterpieces.""

   ""Really, now; that's very interesting. And what don't you like about them? Won't you ever change your mind? Perhaps you think he's a little too sad. Well, well, what I always say is, one should never argue about plays or novels. Everyone has his own way of looking at things, and what may be horrible to you is, perhaps, just what I like best.""

   She was interrupted by Forcheville's addressing Swann. What had happened was that, while Mme. Cottard was discussing Francillon, Forcheville had been expressing to Mme. Verdurin his admiration for what he called the ""little speech"" of the painter. ""Your friend has such a flow of language, such a memory!"" he had said to her when the painter had come to a standstill, ""I've seldom seen anything like it. He'd make a first-rate preacher. By Jove, I wish I was like that. What with him and M. Bréchot you've drawn two lucky numbers to-night; though I'm not so sure that, simply as a speaker, this one doesn't knock spots off the Professor. It comes more naturally with him, less like reading from a book. Of course, the way he goes on, he does use some words that are a bit realistic, and all that; but that's quite the thing nowadays; anyhow, it's not often I've seen a man hold the floor as cleverly as that, 'hold the spittoon,' as we used to say in the regiment, where, by the way, we had a man he rather reminds me of. You could take anything you liked—I don't know what—this glass, say; and he'd talk away about it for hours; no, not this glass; that's a silly thing to say, I'm sorry; but something a little bigger, like the battle of Waterloo, or anything of that sort, he'd tell you things you simply wouldn't believe. Why, Swann was in the regiment then; he must have known him.""

   ""Do you see much of M. Swann?"" asked Mme. Verdurin

   ""Oh dear, no!"" he answered, and then, thinking that if he made himself pleasant to Swann he might find favour with Odette, he decided to take this opportunity of flattering him by speaking of his fashionable friends, but speaking as a man of the world himself, in a tone of good-natured criticism, and not as though he were congratulating Swann upon some undeserved good fortune: ""Isn't that so, Swann? I never see anything of you, do I?—But then, where on earth is one to see him? The creature spends all his time shut up with the La Trémoïlles, with the Laumes and all that lot!"" The imputation would have been false at any time, and was all the more so, now that for at least a year Swann had given up going to almost any house but the Verdurins'. But the mere names of families whom the Verdurins did not know were received by them in a reproachful silence. M. Verdurin, dreading the painful impression which the mention of these 'bores,' especially when flung at her in this tactless fashion, and in front of all the 'faithful,' was bound to make on his wife, cast a covert glance at her, instinct with anxious solicitude. He saw then that in her fixed resolution to take no notice, to have escaped contact, altogether, with the news which had just been addressed to her, not merely to remain dumb but to have been deaf as well, as we pretend to be when a friend who has been in the wrong attempts to slip into his conversation some excuse which we should appear to be accepting, should we appear to have heard it without protesting, or when some one utters the name of an enemy, the very mention of whom in our presence is forbidden; Mme. Verdurin, so that her silence should have the appearance, not of consent but of the unconscious silence which inanimate objects preserve, had suddenly emptied her face of all life, of all mobility; her rounded forehead was nothing, now, but an exquisite study in high relief, which the name of those La Trémoïlles, with whom Swann was always 'shut up,' had failed to penetrate; her nose, just perceptibly wrinkled in a frown, exposed to view two dark cavities that were, surely, modelled from life. You would have said that her half-opened lips were just about to speak. It was all no more, however, than a wax cast, a mask in plaster, the sculptor's design for a monument, a bust to be exhibited in the Palace of Industry, where the public would most certainly gather in front of it and marvel to see how the sculptor, in expressing the unchallengeable dignity of the Verdurins, as opposed to that of the La Trémoïlles or Laumes, whose equals (if not, indeed, their betters) they were, and the equals and betters of all other 'bores' upon the face of the earth, had managed to invest with a majesty that was almost Papal the whiteness and rigidity of his stone. But the marble at last grew animated and let it be understood that it didn't do to be at all squeamish if one went to that house, since the woman was always tipsy and the husband so uneducated that he called a corridor a 'collidor'!

   ""You'd need to pay me a lot of money before I'd let any of that lot set foot inside my house,"" Mme. Verdurin concluded, gazing imperially down on Swann

   She could scarcely have expected him to capitulate so completely as to echo the holy simplicity of the pianist's aunt, who at once exclaimed: ""To think of that, now! What surprises me is that they can get anybody to go near them; I'm sure I should be afraid; one can't be too careful. How can people be so common as to go running after them?""

   But he might, at least, have replied, like Forcheville: ""Gad, she's a duchess; there are still plenty of people who are impressed by that sort of thing,"" which would at least have permitted Mme. Verdurin the final retort, ""And a lot of good may it do them!"" Instead of which, Swann merely smiled, in a manner which shewed, quite clearly, that he could not, of course, take such an absurd suggestion seriously. M. Verdurin, who was still casting furtive and intermittent glances at his wife, could see with regret, and could understand only too well that she was now inflamed with the passion of a Grand Inquisitor who cannot succeed in stamping out a heresy; and so, in the hope of bringing Swann round to a retractation (for the courage of one's opinions is always a form of calculating cowardice in the eyes of the 'other side'), he broke in:

   ""Tell us frankly, now, what you think of them yourself. We shan't repeat it to them, you may be sure.""

   To which Swann answered: ""Why, I'm not in the least afraid of the Duchess (if it is of the La Trémoïlles that you're speaking). I can assure you that everyone likes going to see her. I don't go so far as to say that she's at all 'deep'—"" he pronounced the word as if it meant something ridiculous, for his speech kept the traces of certain mental habits which the recent change in his life, a rejuvenation illustrated by his passion for music, had inclined him temporarily to discard, so that at times he would actually state his views with considerable warmth—""but I am quite sincere when I say that she is intelligent, while her husband is positively a bookworm. They are charming people.""

   His explanation was terribly effective; Mme. Verdurin now realised that this one state of unbelief would prevent her 'little nucleus' from ever attaining to complete unanimity, and was unable to restrain herself, in her fury at the obstinacy of this wretch who could not see what anguish his words were causing her, but cried aloud, from the depths of her tortured heart, ""You may think so if you wish, but at least you need not say so to us.""

   ""It all depends upon what you call intelligence."" Forcheville felt that it was his turn to be brilliant. ""Come now, Swann, tell us what you mean by intelligence.""

   ""There,"" cried Odette, ""that's one of the big things I beg him to tell me about, and he never will.""

   ""Oh, but..."" protested Swann

   ""Oh, but nonsense!"" said Odette

   ""A water-butt?"" asked the Doctor

   ""To you,"" pursued Forcheville, ""does intelligence mean what they call clever talk; you know, the sort of people who worm their way into society?""

   ""Finish your sweet, so that they can take your plate away!"" said Mme. Verdurin sourly to Saniette, who was lost in thought and had stopped eating. And then, perhaps a little ashamed of her rudeness, ""It doesn't matter; take your time about it; there's no hurry; I only reminded you because of the others, you know; it keeps the servants back.""

   ""There is,"" began Brichot, with a resonant smack upon every syllable, ""a rather curious definition of intelligence by that pleasing old anarchist Fénelon...""

   ""Just listen to this!"" Mme. Verdurin rallied Forcheville and the Doctor. ""He's going to give us Fénelon's definition of intelligence. That's interesting. It's not often you get a chance of hearing that!""

   But Brichot was keeping Fénelon's definition until Swann should have given his own. Swann remained silent, and, by this fresh act of recreancy, spoiled the brilliant tournament of dialectic which Mme. Verdurin was rejoicing at being able to offer to Forcheville

   ""You see, it's just the same as with me!"" Odette was peevish. ""I'm not at all sorry to see that I'm not the only one he doesn't find quite up to his level.""

   ""These de La Trémouailles whom Mme. Verdurin has exhibited to us as so little to be desired,"" inquired Brichot, articulating vigorously, ""are they, by any chance, descended from the couple whom that worthy old snob, Sévigné, said she was delighted to know, because it was so good for her peasants? True, the Marquise had another reason, which in her case probably came first, for she was a thorough journalist at heart, and always on the look-out for 'copy.' And, in the journal which she used to send regularly to her daughter, it was Mme. de La Trémouaille, kept well-informed through all her grand connections, who supplied the foreign politics.""

   ""Oh dear, no. I'm quite sure they aren't the same family,"" said Mme. Verdurin desperately

   Saniette who, ever since he had surrendered his untouched plate to the butler, had been plunged once more in silent meditation, emerged finally to tell them, with a nervous laugh, a story of how he had once dined with the Duc de La Trémoïlle, the point of which was that the Duke did not know that George Sand was the pseudonym of a woman. Swann, who really liked Saniette, felt bound to supply him with a few facts illustrative of the Duke's culture, which would prove that such ignorance on his part was literally impossible; but suddenly he stopped short; he had realised, as he was speaking, that Saniette needed no proof, but knew already that the story was untrue for the simple reason that he had at that moment invented it. The worthy man suffered acutely from the Verdurins' always finding him so dull; and as he was conscious of having been more than ordinarily morose this evening, he had made up his mind that he would succeed in being amusing, at least once, before the end of dinner. He surrendered so quickly, looked so wretched at the sight of his castle in ruins, and replied in so craven a tone to Swann, appealing to him not to persist in a refutation which was already superfluous, ""All right; all right; anyhow, even if I have made a mistake that's not a crime, I hope,"" that Swann longed to be able to console him by insisting that the story was indubitably true and exquisitely funny. The Doctor, who had been listening, had an idea that it was the right moment to interject ""Se non è vero,"" but he was not quite certain of the words, and was afraid of being caught out

   After dinner, Forcheville went up to the Doctor. ""She can't have been at all bad looking, Mme. Verdurin; anyhow, she's a woman you can really talk to; that's all I want. Of course she's getting a bit broad in the beam. But Mme. de Crécy! There's a little woman who knows what's what, all right. Upon my word and soul, you can see at a glance she's got the American eye, that girl has. We are speaking of Mme. de Crécy,"" he explained, as M. Verdurin joined them, his pipe in his mouth. ""I should say that, as a specimen of the female form—""

   ""I'd rather have it in my bed than a clap of thunder!"" the words came tumbling from Cottard, who had for some time been waiting in vain until Forcheville should pause for breath, so that he might get in his hoary old joke, a chance for which might not, he feared, come again, if the conversation should take a different turn; and he produced it now with that excessive spontaneity and confidence which may often be noticed attempting to cover up the coldness, and the slight flutter of emotion, inseparable from a prepared recitation. Forcheville knew and saw the joke, and was thoroughly amused. As for M. Verdurin, he was unsparing of his merriment, having recently discovered a way of expressing it by a symbol, different from his wife's, but equally simple and obvious. Scarcely had he begun the movement of head and shoulders of a man who was 'shaking with laughter' than he would begin also to cough, as though, in laughing too violently, he had swallowed a mouthful of smoke from his pipe. And by keeping the pipe firmly in his mouth he could prolong indefinitely the dumb-show of suffocation and hilarity. So he and Mme. Verdurin (who, at the other side of the room, where the painter was telling her a story, was shutting her eyes preparatory to flinging her face into her hands) resembled two masks in a theatre, each representing Comedy, but in a different way

   M. Verdurin had been wiser than he knew in not taking his pipe out of his mouth, for Cottard, having occasion to leave the room for a moment, murmured a witty euphemism which he had recently acquired and repeated now whenever he had to go to the place in question: ""I must just go and see the Duc d'Aumale for a minute,"" so drolly, that M. Verdurin's cough began all over again

   ""Now, then, take your pipe out of your mouth; can't you see, you'll choke if you try to bottle up your laughter like that,"" counselled Mme. Verdurin, as she came round with a tray of liqueurs

   ""What a delightful man your husband is; he has the wit of a dozen!"" declared Forcheville to Mme. Cottard. ""Thank you, thank you, an old soldier like me can never say 'No' to a drink.""

   ""M. de Forcheville thinks Odette charming,"" M. Verdurin told his wife

   ""Why, do you know, she wants so much to meet you again some day at luncheon. We must arrange it, but don't on any account let Swann hear about it. He spoils everything, don't you know. I don't mean to say that you're not to come to dinner too, of course; we hope to see you very often. Now that the warm weather's coming, we're going to have dinner out of doors whenever we can. That won't bore you, will it, a quiet little dinner, now and then, in the Bois? Splendid, splendid, that will be quite delightful....

   ""Aren't you going to do any work this evening, I say?"" she screamed suddenly to the little pianist, seeing an opportunity for displaying, before a 'newcomer' of Forcheville's importance, at once her unfailing wit and her despotic power over the 'faithful.'

   ""M. de Forcheville was just going to say something dreadful about you,"" Mme. Cottard warned her husband as he reappeared in the room. And he, still following up the idea of Forcheville's noble birth, which had obsessed him all through dinner, began again with: ""I am treating a Baroness just now, Baroness Putbus; weren't there some Putbuses in the Crusades? Anyhow they've got a lake in Pomerania that's ten times the size of the Place de la Concorde. I am treating her for dry arthritis; she's a charming woman. Mme. Verdurin knows her too, I believe.""

   Which enabled Forcheville, a moment later, finding himself alone with Mme. Cottard, to complete his favourable verdict on her husband with: ""He's an interesting man, too; you can see that he knows some good people. Gad! but they get to know a lot of things, those doctors.""

   ""D'you want me to play the phrase from the sonata for M. Swann?"" asked the pianist

   ""What the devil's that? Not the sonata-snake, I hope!"" shouted M. de Forcheville, hoping to create an effect. But Dr. Cottard, who had never heard this pun, missed the point of it, and imagined that M. de Forcheville had made a mistake. He dashed in boldly to correct it: ""No, no. The word isn't serpent-à-sonates, it's serpent-à-sonnettes!"" he explained in a tone at once zealous, impatient, and triumphant

   Forcheville explained the joke to him. The Doctor blushed

   ""You'll admit it's not bad, eh, Doctor?""

   ""Oh! I've known it for ages.""

   Then they were silenced; heralded by the waving tremolo of the violin-part, which formed a bristling bodyguard of sound two octaves above it—and as in a mountainous country, against the seeming immobility of a vertically falling torrent, one may distinguish, two hundred feet below, the tiny form of a woman walking in the valley—the little phrase had just appeared, distant but graceful, protected by the long, gradual unfurling of its transparent, incessant and sonorous curtain. And Swann, in his heart of hearts, turned to it, spoke to it as to a confidant in the secret of his love, as to a friend of Odette who would assure him that he need pay no attention to this Forcheville

   ""Ah! you've come too late!"" Mme. Verdurin greeted one of the 'faithful,' whose invitation had been only 'to look in after dinner,' ""we've been having a simply incomparable Brichot! You never heard such eloquence! But he's gone. Isn't that so, M. Swann? I believe it's the first time you've met him,"" she went on, to emphasize the fact that it was to her that Swann owed the introduction. ""Isn't that so; wasn't he delicious, our Brichot?""

   Swann bowed politely

   ""No? You weren't interested?"" she asked dryly

   ""Oh, but I assure you, I was quite enthralled. He is perhaps a little too peremptory, a little too jovial for my taste. I should like to see him a little less confident at times, a little more tolerant, but one feels that he knows a great deal, and on the whole he seems a very sound fellow.""

   The party broke up very late. Cottard's first words to his wife were: ""I have rarely seen Mme. Verdurin in such form as she was to-night.""

   ""What exactly is your Mme. Verdurin? A bit of a bad hat, eh?"" said Forcheville to the painter, to whom he had offered a 'lift.' Odette watched his departure with regret; she dared not refuse to let Swann take her home, but she was moody and irritable in the carriage, and, when he asked whether he might come in, replied, ""I suppose so,"" with an impatient shrug of her shoulders. When they had all gone, Mme. Verdurin said to her husband: ""Did you notice the way Swann laughed, such an idiotic laugh, when we spoke about Mme. La Trémoïlle?""

   She had remarked, more than once, how Swann and Forcheville suppressed the particle 'de' before that lady's name. Never doubting that it was done on purpose, to shew that they were not afraid of a title, she had made up her mind to imitate their arrogance, but had not quite grasped what grammatical form it ought to take. Moreover, the natural corruptness of her speech overcoming her implacable republicanism, she still said instinctively ""the de La Trémoïlles,"" or, rather (by an abbreviation sanctified by the usage of music-hall singers and the writers of the 'captions' beneath caricatures, who elide the 'de'), ""the d'La Trémoïlles,"" but she corrected herself at once to ""Madame La Trémoïlle.—The Duchess, as Swann calls her,"" she added ironically, with a smile which proved that she was merely quoting, and would not, herself, accept the least responsibility for a classification so puerile and absurd

   I don't mind saying that I thought him extremely stupid.""

   M. Verdurin took it up. ""He's not sincere. He's a crafty customer, always hovering between one side and the other. He's always trying to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds. What a difference between him and Forcheville. There, at least, you have a man who tells you straight out what he thinks. Either you agree with him or you don't. Not like the other fellow, who's never definitely fish or fowl. Did you notice, by the way, that Odette seemed all out for Forcheville, and I don't blame her, either. And then, after all, if Swann tries to come the man of fashion over us, the champion of distressed Duchesses, at any rate the other man has got a title; he's always Comte de Forcheville!"" he let the words slip delicately from his lips, as though, familiar with every page of the history of that dignity, he were making a scrupulously exact estimate of its value, in relation to others of the sort

   ""I don't mind saying,"" Mme. Verdurin went on, ""that he saw fit to utter some most venomous, and quite absurd insinuations against Brichot. Naturally, once he saw that Brichot was popular in this house, it was a way of hitting back at us, of spoiling our party. I know his sort, the dear, good friend of the family, who pulls you all to pieces on the stairs as he's going away.""

   ""Didn't I say so?"" retorted her husband. ""He's simply a failure; a poor little wretch who goes through life mad with jealousy of anything that's at all big.""

   Had the truth been known, there was not one of the 'faithful' who was not infinitely more malicious than Swann; but the others would all take the precaution of tempering their malice with obvious pleasantries, with little sparks of emotion and cordiality; while the least indication of reserve on Swann's part, undraped in any such conventional formula as ""Of course, I don't want to say anything—"" to which he would have scorned to descend, appeared to them a deliberate act of treachery. There are certain original and distinguished authors in whom the least 'freedom of speech' is thought revolting because they have not begun by flattering the public taste, and serving up to it the commonplace expressions to which it is used; it was by the same process that Swann infuriated M. Verdurin. In his case as in theirs it was the novelty of his language which led his audience to suspect the blackness of his designs

   Swann was still unconscious of the disgrace that threatened him at the Verdurins', and continued to regard all their absurdities in the most rosy light, through the admiring eyes of love

   As a rule he made no appointments with Odette except for the evenings; he was afraid of her growing tired of him if he visited her during the day as well; at the same time he was reluctant to forfeit, even for an hour, the place that he held in her thoughts, and so was constantly looking out for an opportunity of claiming her attention, in any way that would not be displeasing to her. If, in a florist's or a jeweller's window, a plant or an ornament caught his eye, he would at once think of sending them to Odette, imagining that the pleasure which the casual sight of them had given him would instinctively be felt, also, by her, and would increase her affection for himself; and he would order them to be taken at once to the Rue La pérouse, so as to accelerate the moment in which, as she received an offering from him, he might feel himself, in a sense, transported into her presence. He was particularly anxious, always, that she should receive these presents before she went out for the evening, so that her sense of gratitude towards him might give additional tenderness to her welcome when he arrived at the Verdurins', might even—for all he knew—if the shopkeeper made haste, bring him a letter from her before dinner, or herself, in person, upon his doorstep, come on a little extraordinary visit of thanks. As in an earlier phase, when he had experimented with the reflex action of anger and contempt upon her character, he sought now by that of gratification to elicit from her fresh particles of her intimate feelings, which she had never yet revealed

   Often she was embarrassed by lack of money, and under pressure from a creditor would come to him for assistance. He enjoyed this, as he enjoyed everything which could impress Odette with his love for herself, or merely with his influence, with the extent of the use that she might make of him. Probably if anyone had said to him, at the beginning, ""It's your position that attracts her,"" or at this stage, ""It's your money that she's really in love with,"" he would not have believed the suggestion, nor would he have been greatly distressed by the thought that people supposed her to be attached to him, that people felt them, to be united by any ties so binding as those of snobbishness or wealth. But even if he had accepted the possibility, it might not have caused him any suffering to discover that Odette's love for him was based on a foundation more lasting than mere affection, or any attractive qualities which she might have found in him; on a sound, commercial interest; an interest which would postpone for ever the fatal day on which she might be tempted to bring their relations to an end. For the moment, while he lavished presents upon her, and performed all manner of services, he could rely on advantages not contained in his person, or in his intellect, could forego the endless, killing effort to make himself attractive. And this delight in being a lover, in living by love alone, of the reality of which he was inclined to be doubtful, the price which, in the long run, he must pay for it, as a dilettante in immaterial sensations, enhanced its value in his eyes—as one sees people who are doubtful whether the sight of the sea and the sound of its waves are really enjoyable, become convinced that they are, as also of the rare quality and absolute detachment of their own taste, when they have agreed to pay several pounds a day for a room in an hotel, from which that sight and that sound may be enjoyed

   One day, when reflections of this order had brought him once again to the memory of the time when some one had spoken to him of Odette as of a 'kept' woman, and when, once again, he had amused himself with contrasting that strange personification, the 'kept' woman—an iridescent mixture of unknown and demoniacal qualities, embroidered, as in some fantasy of Gustave Moreau, with poison-dripping flowers, interwoven with precious jewels—with that Odette upon whose face he had watched the passage of the same expressions of pity for a sufferer, resentment of an act of injustice, gratitude for an act of kindness, which he had seen, in earlier days, on his own mother's face, and on the faces of friends; that Odette, whose conversation had so frequently turned on the things that he himself knew better than anyone, his collections, his room, his old servant, his banker, who kept all his title-deeds and bonds;—the thought of the banker reminded him that he must call on him shortly, to draw some money. And indeed, if, during the current month, he were to come less liberally to the aid of Odette in her financial difficulties than in the month before, when he had given her five thousand francs, if he refrained from offering her a diamond necklace for which she longed, he would be allowing her admiration for his generosity to decline, that gratitude which had made him so happy, and would even be running the risk of her imagining that his love for her (as she saw its visible manifestations grow fewer) had itself diminished. And then, suddenly, he asked himself whether that was not precisely what was implied by 'keeping' a woman (as if, in fact, that idea of 'keeping' could be derived from elements not at all mysterious nor perverse, but belonging to the intimate routine of his daily life, such as that thousand-franc note, a familiar and domestic object, torn in places and mended with gummed paper, which his valet, after paying the household accounts and the rent, had locked up hi a drawer in the old writing-desk whence he had extracted it to send it, with four others, to Odette) and whether it was not possible to apply to Odette, since he had known her (for he never imagined for a moment that she could ever have taken a penny from anyone else, before), that title, which he had believed so wholly inapplicable to her, of 'kept' woman. He could not explore the idea further, for a sudden access of that mental lethargy which was, with him, congenital, intermittent and providential, happened, at that moment, to extinguish every particle of light in his brain, as instantaneously as, at a later period, when electric lighting had been everywhere installed, it became possible, merely by fingering a switch, to cut off all the supply of light from a house. His mind fumbled, for a moment, in the darkness, he took off his spectacles, wiped the glasses, passed his hands over his eyes, but saw no light until he found himself face to face with a wholly different idea, the realisation that he must endeavour, in the coming month, to send Odette six or seven thousand-franc notes instead of five, simply as a surprise for her and to give her pleasure

   In the evening, when he did not stay at home until it was time to meet Odette at the Verdurins', or rather at one of the open-air restaurants which they liked to frequent in the Bois and especially at Saint-Cloud, he would go to dine in one of those fashionable houses in which, at one time, he had been a constant guest. He did not wish to lose touch with people who, for all that he knew, might be of use, some day, to Odette, and thanks to whom he was often, in the meantime, able to procure for her some privilege or pleasure. Besides, he had been used for so long to the refinement and comfort of good society that, side by side with his contempt, there had grown up also a desperate need for it, with the result that, when he had reached the point after which the humblest lodgings appeared to him as precisely on a par with the most princely mansions, his senses were so thoroughly accustomed to the latter that he could not enter the former without a feeling of acute discomfort. He had the same regard—to a degree of identity which they would never have suspected—for the little families with small incomes who asked him to dances in their flats (""straight upstairs to the fifth floor, and the door on the left"") as for the Princesse de Parme, who gave the most splendid parties in Paris; but he had not the feeling of being actually 'at the ball' when he found himself herded with the fathers of families in the bedroom of the lady of the house, while the spectacle of wash-hand-stands covered over with towels, and of beds converted into cloak-rooms, with a mass of hats and great-coats sprawling over their counterpanes, gave him the same stifling sensation that, nowadays, people who have been used for half a lifetime to electric light derive from a smoking lamp or a candle that needs to be snuffed. If he were dining out, he would order his carriage for half-past seven; while he changed his clothes, he would be wondering, all the time, about Odette, and in this way was never alone, for the constant thought of Odette gave to the moments in which he was separated from her the same peculiar charm as to those in which she was at his side. He would get into his carriage and drive off, but he knew that this thought had jumped in after him and had settled down upon his knee, like a pet animal which he might take everywhere, and would keep with him at the dinner-table, unobserved by his fellow-guests. He would stroke and fondle it, warm himself with it, and, as a feeling of languor swept over him, would give way to a slight shuddering movement which contracted his throat and nostrils—a new experience, this,—as he fastened the bunch of columbines in his buttonhole. He had for some time been feeling neither well nor happy, especially since Odette had brought Forcheville to the Verdurins', and he would have liked to go away for a while to rest in the country. But he could never summon up courage to leave Paris, even for a day, while Odette was there. The weather was warm; it was the finest part of the spring. And for all that he was driving through a city of stone to immure himself in a house without grass or garden, what was incessantly before his eyes was a park which he owned, near Combray, where, at four in the afternoon, before coming to the asparagus-bed, thanks to the breeze that was wafted across the fields from Méséglise, he could enjoy the fragrant coolness of the air as well beneath an arbour of hornbeams in the garden as by the bank of the pond, fringed with forget-me-not and iris; and where, when he sat down to dinner, trained and twined by the gardener's skilful hand, there ran all about his table currant-bush and rose

   After dinner, if he had an early appointment in the Bois or at Saint-Cloud, he would rise from table and leave the house so abruptly—especially if it threatened to rain, and so to scatter the 'faithful' before their normal time—that on one occasion the Princesse des Laumes (at whose house dinner had been so late that Swann had left before the coffee came in, to join the Verdurins on the Island in the Bois) observed:

   ""Really, if Swann were thirty years older, and had diabetes, there might be some excuse for his running away like that. He seems to look upon us all as a joke.""

   He persuaded himself that the spring-time charm, which he could not go down to Combray to enjoy, he would find at least on the He des Cygnes or at Saint-Cloud. But as he could think only of Odette, he would return home not knowing even if he had tasted the fragrance of the young leaves, or if the moon had been shining. He would be welcomed by the little phrase from the sonata, played in the garden on the restaurant piano. If there was none in the garden, the Verdurins would have taken immense pains to have a piano brought out either from a private room or from the restaurant itself; not because Swann was now restored to favour; far from it. But the idea of arranging an ingenious form of entertainment for some one, even for some one whom they disliked, would stimulate them, during the time spent in its preparation, to a momentary sense of cordiality and affection. Now and then he would remind himself that another fine spring evening was drawing to a close, and would force himself to notice the trees and the sky. But the state of excitement into which Odette's presence never failed to throw him, added to a feverish ailment which, for some time now, had scarcely left him, robbed him of that sense of quiet and comfort which is an indispensable background to the impressions that we derive from nature

   One evening, when Swann had consented to dine with the Verdurins, and had mentioned during dinner that he had to attend, next day, the annual banquet of an old comrades' association, Odette had at once exclaimed across the table, in front of everyone, in front of Forcheville, who was now one of the 'faithful,' in front of the painter, in front of Cottard:

   ""Yes, I know, you have your banquet to-morrow; I sha'n't see you, then, till I get home; don't be too late.""

   And although Swann had never yet taken offence, at all seriously, at Odette's demonstrations of friendship for one or other of the 'faithful,' he felt an exquisite pleasure on hearing her thus avow, before them all, with that calm immodesty, the fact that they saw each other regularly every evening, his privileged position in her house, and her own preference for him which it implied. It was true that Swann had often reflected that Odette was in no way a remarkable woman; and in the supremacy which he wielded over a creature so distinctly inferior to himself there was nothing that especially flattered him when he heard it proclaimed to all the 'faithful'; but since he had observed that, to several other men than himself, Odette seemed a fascinating and desirable woman, the attraction which her body held for him had aroused a painful longing to secure the absolute mastery of even the tiniest particles of her heart. And he had begun to attach an incalculable value to those moments passed in her house in the evenings, when he held her upon his knee, made her tell him what she thought about this or that, and counted over that treasure to which, alone of all his earthly possessions, he still clung. And so, after this dinner, drawing her aside, he took care to thank her effusively, seeking to indicate to her by the extent of his gratitude the corresponding intensity of the pleasures which it was in her power to bestow on him, the supreme pleasure being to guarantee him immunity, for as long as his love should last and he remain vulnerable, from the assaults of jealousy

   When he came away from his banquet, the next evening, it was pouring rain, and he had nothing but his victoria. A friend offered to take him home in a closed carriage, and as Odette, by the fact of her having invited him to come, had given him an assurance that she was expecting no one else, he could, with a quiet mind and an untroubled heart, rather than set off thus in the rain, have gone home and to bed. But perhaps, if she saw that he seemed not to adhere to his resolution to end every evening, without exception, in her company, she might grow careless, and fail to keep free for him just the one evening on which he particularly desired it

   It was after eleven when he reached her door, and as he made his apology for having been unable to come away earlier, she complained that it was indeed very late; the storm had made her unwell, her head ached, and she warned him that she would not let him stay longer than half an hour, that at midnight she would send him away; a little while later she felt tired and wished to sleep

   ""No cattleya, then, to-night?"" he asked, ""and I've been looking forward so to a nice little cattleya.""

   But she was irresponsive; saying nervously: ""No, dear, no cattleya tonight. Can't you see, I'm not well?""

   ""It might have done you good, but I won't bother you.""

   She begged him to put out the light before he went; he drew the curtains close round her bed and left her. But, when he was in his own house again, the idea suddenly struck him that, perhaps, Odette was expecting some one else that evening, that she had merely pretended to be tired, that she had asked him to put the light out only so that he should suppose that she was going to sleep, that the moment he had left the house she had lighted it again, and had reopened her door to the stranger who was to be her guest for the night. He looked at his watch. It was about an hour and a half since he had left her; he went out, took a cab, and stopped it close to her house, in a little street running at right angles to that other street, which lay at the back of her house, and along which he used to go, sometimes, to tap upon her bedroom window, for her to let him in. He left his cab; the streets were all deserted and dark; he walked a few yards and came out almost opposite her house. Amid the glimmering blackness of all the row of windows, the lights in which had long since been put out, he saw one, and only one, from which overflowed, between the slats of its shutters, dosed like a wine-press over its mysterious golden juice, the light that filled the room within, a light which on so many evenings, as soon as he saw it, far off, as he turned into the street, had rejoiced his heart with its message: ""She is there—expecting you,"" and now tortured him with: ""She is there with the man she was expecting."" He must know who; he tiptoed along by the wall until he reached the window, but between the slanting bars of the shutters he could see nothing; he could hear, only, in the silence of the night, the murmur of conversation. What agony he suffered as he watched that light, in whose golden atmosphere were moving, behind the closed sash, the unseen and detested pair, as he listened to that murmur which revealed the presence of the man who had crept in after his own departure, the perfidy of Odette, and the pleasures which she was at that moment tasting with the stranger

   And yet he was not sorry that he had come; the torment which had forced him to leave his own house had lost its sharpness when it lost its uncertainty, now that Odette's other life, of which he had had, at that first moment, a sudden helpless suspicion, was definitely there, almost within his grasp, before his eyes, in the full glare of the lamp-light, caught and kept there, an unwitting prisoner, in that room into which, when he would, he might force his way to surprise and seize it; or rather he would tap upon the shutters, as he had often done when he had come there very late, and by that signal Odette would at least learn that he knew, that he had seen the light and had heard the voices; while he himself, who a moment ago had been picturing her as laughing at him, as sharing with that other the knowledge of how effectively he had been tricked, now it was he that saw them, confident and persistent in their error, tricked and trapped by none other than himself, whom they believed to be a mile away, but who was there, in person, there with a plan, there with the knowledge that he was going, in another minute, to tap upon the shutter. And, perhaps, what he felt (almost an agreeable feeling) at that moment was something more than relief at the solution of a doubt, at the soothing of a pain; was an intellectual pleasure. If, since he had fallen in love, things had recovered a little of the delicate attraction that they had had for him long ago—though only when a light was shed upon them by a thought, a memory of Odette—now it was another of the faculties, prominent in the studious days of his youth, that Odette had quickened with new life, the passion for truth, but for a truth which, too, was interposed between himself and his mistress, receiving its light from her alone, a private and personal truth the sole object of which (an infinitely precious object, and one almost impersonal in its absolute beauty) was Odette—Odette in her activities, her environment, her projects, and her past. At every other period in his life, the little everyday words and actions of another person had always seemed wholly valueless to Swann; if gossip about such things were repeated to him, he would dismiss it as insignificant, and while he listened it was only the lowest, the most commonplace part of his mind that was interested; at such moments he felt utterly dull and uninspired. But in this strange phase of love the personality of another person becomes so enlarged, so deepened, that the curiosity which he could now feel aroused in himself, to know the least details of a woman's daily occupation, was the same thirst for knowledge with which he had once studied history. And all manner of actions, from which, until now, he would have recoiled in shame, such as spying, to-night, outside a window, to-morrow, for all he knew, putting adroitly provocative questions to casual witnesses, bribing servants, listening at doors, seemed to him, now, to be precisely on a level with the deciphering of manuscripts, the weighing of evidence, the interpretation of old monuments, that was to say, so many different methods of scientific investigation, each one having a definite intellectual value and being legitimately employable in the search for truth

   As his hand stole out towards the shutters he felt a pang of shame at the thought that Odette would now know that he had suspected her, that he had returned, that he had posted himself outside her window. She had often told him what a horror she had of jealous men, of lovers who spied. What he was going to do would be extremely awkward, and she would detest him for ever after, whereas now, for the moment, for so long as he refrained from knocking, perhaps even in the act of infidelity, she loved him still. How often is not the prospect of future happiness thus sacrificed to one's impatient insistence upon an immediate gratification. But his desire to know the truth was stronger, and seemed to him nobler than his desire for her. He knew that the true story of certain events, which he would have given his life to be able to reconstruct accurately and in full, was to be read within that window, streaked with bars of light, as within the illuminated, golden boards of one of those precious manuscripts, by whose wealth of artistic treasures the scholar who consults them cannot remain unmoved. He yearned for the satisfaction of knowing the truth which so impassioned him in that brief, fleeting, precious transcript, on that translucent page, so warm, so beautiful. And besides, the advantage which he felt—which he so desperately wanted to feel—that he had over them, lay perhaps not so much in knowing as in being able to shew them that he knew. He drew himself up on tiptoe. He knocked. They had not heard; he knocked again; louder; their conversation ceased. A man's voice—he strained his ears to distinguish whose, among such of Odette's friends as he knew, the voice could be—asked:

   ""Who's that?""

   He could not be certain of the voice. He knocked once again. The window first, then the shutters were thrown open. It was too late, now, to retire, and since she must know all, so as not to seem too contemptible, too jealous and inquisitive, he called out in a careless, hearty, welcoming tone:

   ""Please don't bother; I just happened to be passing, and saw the light. I wanted to know if you were feeling better.""

   He looked up. Two old gentlemen stood facing him, in the window, one of them with a lamp in his hand; and beyond them he could see into the room, a room that he had never seen before. Having fallen into the habit, When he came late to Odette, of identifying her window by the fact that it was the only one still lighted in a row of windows otherwise all alike, he had been misled, this time, by the light, and had knocked at the window beyond hers, in the adjoining house. He made what apology he could and hurried home, overjoyed that the satisfaction of his curiosity had preserved their love intact, and that, having feigned for so long, when in Odette's company, a sort of indifference, he had not now, by a demonstration of jealousy, given her that proof of the excess of his own passion which, in a pair of lovers, fully and finally dispenses the recipient from the obligation to love the other enough. He never spoke to her of this misadventure, he ceased even to think of it himself. But now and then his thoughts in their wandering course would come upon this memory where it lay unobserved, would startle it into life, thrust it more deeply down into his consciousness, and leave him aching with a sharp, far-rooted pain. As though this had been a bodily pain, Swann's mind was powerless to alleviate it; in the case of bodily pain, however, since it is independent of the mind, the mind can dwell upon it, can note that it has diminished, that it has momentarily ceased. But with this mental pain, the mind, merely by recalling it, created it afresh. To determine not to think of it was but to think of it still, to suffer from it still. And when, in conversation with his friends, he forgot his sufferings, suddenly a word casually uttered would make him change countenance as a wounded man does when a clumsy hand has touched his aching limb. When he came away from Odette, he was happy, he felt calm, he recalled the smile with which, in gentle mockery, she had spoken to him of this man or of that, a smile which was all tenderness for himself; he recalled the gravity of her head which she seemed to have lifted from its axis to let it droop and fall, as though against her will, upon his lips, as she had done on that first evening in the carriage; her languishing gaze at him while she lay nestling in his arms, her bended head seeming to recede between her shoulders, as though shrinking from the cold

   But then, at once, his jealousy, as it had been the shadow of his love, presented him with the complement, with the converse of that new smile with which she had greeted him that very evening,—with which, now, perversely, she was mocking Swann while she tendered her love to another—of that lowering of her head, but lowered now to fall on other lips, and (but bestowed upon a stranger) of all the marks of affection that she had shewn to him. And all these voluptuous memories which he bore away from her house were, as one might say, but so many sketches, rough plans, like the schemes of decoration which a designer submits to one in outline, enabling Swann to form an idea of the various attitudes, aflame or faint with passion, which she was capable of adopting for others. With the result that he came to regret every pleasure that he tasted in her company, every new caress that he invented (and had been so imprudent as to point out to her how delightful it was), every fresh charm that he found in her, for he knew that, a moment later, they would go to enrich the collection of instruments in his secret torture-chamber

   A fresh turn was given to the screw when Swann recalled a sudden expression which he had intercepted, a few days earlier, and for the first time, in Odette's eyes. It was after dinner at the Verdurins'. Whether it was because Forcheville, aware that Saniette, his brother-in-law, was not in favour with them, had decided to make a butt of him, and to shine at his expense, or because he had been annoyed by some awkward remark which Saniette had made to him, although it had passed unnoticed by the rest of the party who knew nothing of whatever tactless allusion it might conceal, or possibly because he had been for some time looking out for an opportunity of securing the expulsion from the house of a fellow-guest who knew rather too much about him, and whom he knew to be so nice-minded that he himself could not help feeling embarrassed at times merely by his presence in the room, Forcheville replied to Saniette's tactless utterance with such a volley of abuse, going out of his way to insult him, emboldened, the louder he shouted, by the fear, the pain, the entreaties of his victim, that the poor creature, after asking Mme. Verdurin whether he should stay and receiving no answer, had left the house in stammering confusion and with tears in his eyes. Odette had looked on, impassive, at this scene; but when the door had closed behind Saniette, she had forced the normal expression of her face down, as the saying is, by several pegs, so as to bring herself on to the same level of vulgarity as Forcheville; her eyes had sparkled with a malicious smile of congratulation upon his audacity, of ironical pity for the poor wretch who had been its victim; she had darted at him a look of complicity in the crime, which so clearly implied: ""That's finished him off, or I'm very much mistaken. Did you see what a fool he looked? He was actually crying,"" that Forcheville, when his eyes met hers, sobered in a moment from the anger, or pretended anger with which he was still flushed, smiled as he explained: ""He need only have made himself pleasant and he'd have been here still; a good scolding does a man no harm, at any time.""

   One day when Swann had gone out early in the afternoon to pay a call, and had failed to find the person at home whom he wished to see, it occurred to him to go, instead, to Odette, at an hour when, although he never went to her house then as a rule, he knew that she was always at home, resting or writing letters until tea-time, and would enjoy seeing her for a moment, if it did not disturb her. The porter told him that he believed Odette to be in; Swann rang the bell, thought that he heard a sound, that he heard footsteps, but no one came to the door. Anxious and annoyed, he went round to the other little street, at the back of her house, and stood beneath her bedroom window; the curtains were drawn and he could see nothing; he knocked loudly upon the pane, he shouted; still no one came. He could see that the neighbours were staring at him. He turned away, thinking that, after all, he had perhaps been mistaken in believing that he heard footsteps; but he remained so preoccupied with the suspicion that he could turn his mind to nothing else. After waiting for an hour, he returned. He found her at home; she told him that she had been in the house when he rang, but had been asleep; the bell had awakened her; she had guessed that it must be Swann, and had run out to meet him, but he had already gone. She had, of course, heard him knocking at the window. Swann could at once detect in this story one of those fragments of literal truth which liars, when taken by surprise, console themselves by introducing into the composition of the falsehood which they have to invent, thinking that it can be safely incorporated, and will lend the whole story an air of verisimilitude. It was true that, when Odette had just done something which she did not wish to disclose, she would take pains to conceal it in a secret place in her heart. But as soon as she found herself face to face with the man to whom she was obliged to lie, she became uneasy, all her ideas melted like wax before a flame, her inventive and her reasoning faculties were paralysed, she might ransack her brain but would find only a void; still, she must say something, and there lay within her reach precisely the fact which she had wished to conceal, which, being the truth, was the one thing that had remained. She broke off from it a tiny fragment, of no importance in itself, assuring herself that, after all, it was the best thing to do, since it was a detail of the truth, and less dangerous, therefore, than a falsehood. ""At any rate, this is true,"" she said to herself; ""that's always something to the good; he may make inquiries; he will see that this is true; it won't be this, anyhow, that will give me away."" But she was wrong; it was what gave her away; she had not taken into account that this fragmentary detail of the truth had sharp edges which could not: be made to fit in, except to those contiguous fragments of the truth from which she had arbitrarily detached it, edges which, whatever the fictitious details in which she might embed it, would continue to shew, by their overlapping angles and by the gaps which she had forgotten to fill, that its proper place was elsewhere

   ""She admits that she heard me ring, and then knock, that she knew it was myself, that she wanted to see me,"" Swann thought to himself. ""But that doesn't correspond with the fact that she did not let me in.""

   He did not, however, draw her attention to this inconsistency, for he thought that, if left to herself, Odette might perhaps produce some falsehood which would give him a faint indication of the truth; she spoke; he did not interrupt her, he gathered up, with an eager and sorrowful piety, the words that fell from her lips, feeling (and rightly feeling, since she was hiding the truth behind them as she spoke) that, like the veil of a sanctuary, they kept a vague imprint, traced a faint outline of that infinitely precious and, alas, undiscoverable truth;—what she had been doing, that afternoon, at three o'clock, when he had called,—a truth of which he would never possess any more than these falsifications, illegible and divine traces, a truth which would exist henceforward only in the secretive memory of this creature, who would contemplate it in utter ignorance of its value, but would never yield it up to him. It was true that he had, now and then, a strong suspicion that Odette's daily activities were not hi themselves passionately interesting, and that such relations as she might have with other men did not exhale, naturally, in a universal sense, or for every rational being, a spirit of morbid gloom capable of infecting with fever or of inciting to suicide. He realised, at such moments, that that interest, that gloom, existed in him only as a malady might exist, and that, once he was cured of the malady, the actions of Odette, the kisses that she might have bestowed, would become once again as innocuous as those of countless other women. But the consciousness that the painful curiosity with which Swann now studied them had its origin only in himself was not enough to make him decide that it was unreasonable to regard that curiosity as important, and to take every possible step to satisfy it. Swann had, in fact, reached an age the philosophy of which—supported, in his case, by the current philosophy of the day, as well as by that of the circle in which he had spent most of his life, the group that surrounded the Princesse des Laumes, in which one's intelligence was understood to increase with the strength of one's disbelief in everything, and nothing real and incontestable was to be discovered, except the individual tastes of each of its members—is no longer that of youth, but a positive, almost a medical philosophy, the philosophy of men who, instead of fixing their aspirations upon external objects, endeavour to separate from the accumulation of the years already spent a definite residue of habits and passions which they can regard as characteristic and permanent, and with which they will deliberately arrange, before anything else, that the kind of existence which they choose to adopt shall not prove inharmonious. Swann deemed it wise to make allowance in his life for the suffering which he derived from not knowing what Odette had done, just as he made allowance for the impetus which a damp climate always gave to his eczema; to anticipate in his budget the expenditure of a considerable sum on procuring, with regard to the daily occupations of Odette, information the lack of which would make him unhappy, just as he reserved a margin for the gratification of other tastes from which he knew that pleasure was to be expected (at least, before he had fallen in love) such as his taste for collecting things, or for good cooking

   When he proposed to take leave of Odette, and to return home, she begged him to stay a little longer, and even detained him forcibly, seizing him by the arm as he was opening the door to go. But he gave no thought to that, for, among the crowd of gestures and speeches and other little incidents which go to make up a conversation, it is inevitable that we should pass (without noticing anything that arouses our interest) by those that hide a truth for which our suspicions are blindly searching, whereas we stop to examine others beneath which nothing lies concealed. She kept on saying: ""What a dreadful pity; you never by any chance come in the afternoon, and the one time you do come then I miss you."" He knew very well that she was not sufficiently in love with him to be so keenly distressed merely at having missed his visit, but as she was a good-natured woman, anxious to give him pleasure, and often sorry when she had done anything that annoyed him, he found it quite natural that she should be sorry, on this occasion, that she had deprived him of that pleasure of spending an hour in her company, which was so very great a pleasure, if not to herself, at any rate to him. All the same, it was a matter of so little importance that her air of unrelieved sorrow began at length to bewilder him. She reminded him, even more than was usual, of the faces of some of the women created by the painter of the Primavera.' She had, at that moment, their downcast, heartbroken expression, which seems ready to succumb beneath the burden of a grief too heavy to be borne, when they are merely allowing the Infant Jesus to play with a pomegranate, or watching Moses pour water into a trough. He had seen the same sorrow once before on her face, but when, he could no longer say. Then, suddenly, he remembered it; it was when Odette had lied, in apologising to Mme. Verdurin on the evening after the dinner from which she had stayed away on a pretext of illness, but really so that she might be alone with Swann. Surely, even had she been the most scrupulous of women, she could hardly have felt remorse for so innocent a lie. But the lies which Odette ordinarily told were less innocent, and served to prevent discoveries which might have involved her in the most terrible difficulties with one or another of her friends. And so, when she lied, smitten with fear, feeling herself to be but feebly armed for her defence, unconfident of success, she was inclined to weep from sheer exhaustion, as children weep sometimes when they have not slept. She knew, also, that her lie, as a rule, was doing a serious injury to the man to whom she was telling it, and that she might find herself at his mercy if she told it badly. Therefore she felt at once humble and culpable in his presence. And when she had to tell an insignificant, social lie its hazardous associations, and the memories which it recalled, would leave her weak with a sense of exhaustion and penitent with a consciousness of wrongdoing

   What depressing lie was she now concocting for Swann's benefit, to give her that pained expression, that plaintive voice, which seemed to falter beneath the effort that she was forcing herself to make, and to plead for pardon? He had an idea that it was not merely the truth about what had occurred that afternoon that she was endeavouring to hide from him, but something more immediate, something, possibly, which had not yet happened, but might happen now at any time, and, when it did, would throw a light upon that earlier event. At that moment, he heard the front-door bell ring. Odette never stopped speaking, but her words dwindled into an inarticulate moan. Her regret at not having seen Swann that afternoon, at not having opened the door to him, had melted into a universal despair

   He could hear the gate being closed, and the sound of a carriage, as though some one were going away—probably the person whom Swann must on no account meet—after being told that Odette was not at home. And then, when he reflected that, merely by coming at an hour when he was not in the habit of coming, he had managed to disturb so many arrangements of which she did not wish him to know, he had a feeling of discouragement that amounted, almost, to distress. But since he was in love with Odette, since he was in the habit of turning all his thoughts towards her, the pity with which he might have been inspired for himself he felt for her only, and murmured: ""Poor darling!"" When finally he left her, she took up several letters which were lying on the table, and asked him if he would be so good as to post them for her. He walked along to the post-office, took the letters from his pocket, and, before dropping each of them into the box, scanned its address. They were all to tradesmen, except the last, which was to Forcheville. He kept it in his hand. ""If I saw what was in this,"" he argued, ""I should know what she calls him, what she says to him, whether there really is anything between them. Perhaps, if I don't look inside, I shall be lacking in delicacy towards Odette, since in this way alone I can rid myself of a suspicion which is, perhaps, a calumny on her, which must, in any case, cause her suffering, and which can never possibly be set at rest, once the letter is posted.""

   He left the post-office and went home, but he had kept the last letter in his pocket. He lighted a candle, and held up close to its flame the envelope which he had not dared to open. At first he could distinguish nothing, but the envelope was thin, and by pressing it down on to the stiff card which it enclosed he was able, through the transparent paper, to read the concluding words. They were a coldly formal signature. If, instead of its being himself who was looking at a letter addressed to Forcheville, it had been Forcheville who had read a letter addressed to Swann, he might have found words in it of another, a far more tender kind! He took a firm hold of the card, which was sliding to and fro, the envelope being too large for it and then, by moving it with his finger and thumb, brought one line after another beneath the part of the envelope where the paper was not doubled, through which alone it was possible to read

   In spite of all these manoeuvres he could not make it out clearly. Not that it mattered, for he had seen enough to assure himself that the letter was about some trifling incident of no importance, and had nothing at all to do with love; it was something to do with Odette's uncle. Swann had read quite plainly at the beginning of the line ""I was right,"" but did not understand what Odette had been right in doing, until suddenly a word which he had not been able, at first, to decipher, came to light and made the whole sentence intelligible: ""I was right to open the door; it was my uncle."" To open the door! Then Forcheville had been there when Swann rang the bell, and she had sent him away; hence the sound that Swann had heard

   After that he read the whole letter; at the end she apologised for having treated Forcheville with so little ceremony, and reminded him that he had left his cigarette-case at her house, precisely what she had written to Swann after one of his first visits. But to Swann she had added: ""Why did you not forget your heart also? I should never have let you have that back."" To Forcheville nothing of that sort; no allusion that could suggest any intrigue between them. And, really, he was obliged to admit that in all this business Forcheville had been worse treated than himself, since Odette was writing to him to make him believe that her visitor had been an uncle. From which it followed that he, Swann, was the man to whom she attached importance, and for whose sake she had sent the other away. And yet, if there had been nothing between Odette and Forcheville, why not have opened the door at once, why have said, ""I was right to open the door; it was my uncle."" Right? if she was doing nothing wrong at that moment how could Forcheville possibly have accounted for her not opening the door? For a time Swann stood still there, heartbroken, bewildered, and yet happy; gazing at this envelope which Odette had handed to him without a scruple, so absolute was her trust in his honour; through its transparent window there had been disclosed to him, with the secret history of an incident which he had despaired of ever being able to learn, a fragment of the life of Odette, seen as through a narrow, luminous incision, cut into its surface without her knowledge. Then his jealousy rejoiced at the discovery, as though that jealousy had had an independent existence, fiercely egotistical, gluttonous of every thing that would feed its vitality, even at the expense of Swann himself. Now it had food in store, and Swann could begin to grow uneasy afresh every evening, over the visits that Odette had received about five o'clock, and could seek to discover where Forcheville had been at that hour. For Swann's affection for Odette still preserved the form which had been imposed on it, from the beginning, by his ignorance of the occupations in which she passed her days, as well as by the mental lethargy which prevented him from supplementing that ignorance by imagination. He was not jealous, at first, of the whole of Odette's life, but of those moments only in which an incident, which he had perhaps misinterpreted, had led him to suppose that Odette might have played him false. His jealousy, like an octopus which throws out a first, then a second, and finally a third tentacle, fastened itself irremovably first to that moment, five o'clock in the afternoon, then to another, then to another again. But Swann was incapable of inventing his sufferings. They were only the memory, the perpetuation of a suffering that had come to him from without

   From without, however, everything brought him fresh suffering. He decided to separate Odette from Forcheville, by taking her away for a few days to the south. But he imagined that she was coveted by every male person in the hotel, and that she coveted them in return. And so he, who, in old days, when he travelled, used always to seek out new people and crowded places, might now be seen fleeing savagely from human society as if it had cruelly injured him. And how could he not have turned misanthrope, when in every man he saw a potential lover for Odette? Thus his jealousy did even more than the happy, passionate desire which he had originally felt for Odette had done to alter Swann's character, completely changing, in the eyes of the world, even the outward signs by which that character had been intelligible

   A month after the evening on which he had intercepted and read Odette's letter to Forcheville, Swann went to a dinner which the Verdurins were giving in the Bois. As the party was breaking up he noticed a series of whispered discussions between Mme. Verdurin and several of her guests, and thought that he heard the pianist being reminded to come next day to a party at Chatou; now he, Swann, had not been invited to any party

   The Verdurins had spoken only in whispers, and in vague terms, but the painter, perhaps without thinking, shouted out: ""There must be no lights of any sort, and he must play the Moonlight Sonata in the dark, for us to see by.""

   Mme. Verdurin, seeing that Swann was within earshot, assumed that expression in which the two-fold desire to make the speaker be quiet and to preserve, oneself, an appearance of guilelessness in the eyes of the listener, is neutralised in an intense vacuity; in which the unflinching signs of intelligent complicity are overlaid by the smiles of innocence, an expression invariably adopted by anyone who has noticed a blunder, the enormity of which is thereby at once revealed if not to those who have made it, at any rate to him in whose hearing it ought not to have been made. Odette seemed suddenly to be in despair, as though she had decided not to struggle any longer against the crushing difficulties of life, and Swann was anxiously counting the minutes that still separated him from the point at which, after leaving the restaurant, while he drove her home, he would be able to ask for an explanation, to make her promise, either that she would not go to Chatou next day, or that she would procure an invitation for him also, and to lull to rest in her arms the anguish that still tormented him. At last the carriages were ordered. Mme. Verdurin said to Swann:

   ""Good-bye, then. We shall see you soon, I hope,"" trying, by the friendliness of her manner and the constraint of her smile, to prevent him from noticing that she Was not saying, as she would always have until then:

   ""To-morrow, then, at Chatou, and at my house the day after."" M. and Mme. Verdurin made Forcheville get into their carriage; Swann's was drawn up behind it, and he waited for theirs to start before helping Odette into his own

   ""Odette, we'll take you,"" said Mme. Verdurin, ""we've kept a little corner specially for you, beside M. de Forcheville.""

   ""Yes, Mme. Verdurin,"" said Odette meekly

   ""What! I thought I was to take you home,"" cried Swann, flinging discretion to the winds, for the carriage-door hung open, time was precious, and he could not, in his present state, go home without her

   ""But Mme. Verdurin has asked me...""

   ""That's all right, you can quite well go home alone; we've left you like this dozens of times,"" said Mme. Verdurin

   ""But I had something important to tell Mme. de Crécy.""

   ""Very well, you can write it to her instead.""

   ""Good-bye,"" said Odette, holding out her hand

   He tried hard to smile, but could only succeed in looking utterly dejected

   ""What do you think of the airs that Swann is pleased to put on with us?"" Mme. Verdurin asked her husband when they had reached home. ""I was afraid he was going to eat me, simply because we offered to take Odette back. It really is too bad, that sort of thing. Why doesn't he say, straight out, that we keep a disorderly house? I can't conceive how Odette can stand such manners. He positively seems to be saying, all the time, 'You belong to me!' I shall tell Odette exactly what I think about it all, and I hope she will have the sense to understand me."" A moment later she added, inarticulate with rage: ""No, but, don't you see, the filthy creature..."" using unconsciously, and perhaps in satisfaction of the same obscure need to justify herself—like Françoise at Combray when the chicken refused to die—the very words which the last convulsions of an inoffensive animal in its death agony wring from the peasant who is engaged in taking its life. And when Mme. Verdurin's carriage had moved on, and Swann's took its place, his coachman, catching sight of his face, asked whether he was unwell, or had heard bad news

   Swann sent him away; he preferred to walk, and it was on foot, through the Bois, that he came home. He talked to himself, aloud, and in the same slightly affected tone which he had been used to adopt when describing the charms of the 'little nucleus' and extolling the magnanimity of the Verdurins. But just as the conversation, the smiles, the kisses of Odette became as odious to him as he had once found them charming, if they were diverted to others than himself, so the Verdurins' drawing-room, which, not an hour before, had still seemed to him amusing, inspired with a genuine feeling for art and even with a sort of moral aristocracy, now that it was another than himself whom Odette was going to meet there, to love there without restraint, laid bare to him all its absurdities, its stupidity, its shame

   He drew a fanciful picture, at which he shuddered in disgust, of the party next evening at Chatou. ""Imagine going to Chatou, of all places! Like a lot of drapers after closing time! Upon my word, these people are sublime in their smugness; they can't really exist; they must all have come out of one of Labiche's plays!""

   The Cottards would be there; possibly Brichot. ""Could anything be more grotesque than the lives of these little creatures, hanging on to one another like that. They'd imagine they were utterly lost, upon my soul they would, if they didn't all meet again to-morrow at Chatou!"" Alas! there would be the painter there also, the painter who enjoyed match-making, who would invite Forcheville to come with Odette to his studio. He could see Odette, in a dress far too smart for the country, ""for she is so vulgar in that way, and, poor little thing, she is such a fool!""

   He could hear the jokes that Mme. Verdurin would make after dinner, jokes which, whoever the 'bore' might be at whom they were aimed, had always amused him because he could watch Odette laughing at them, laughing with him, her laughter almost a part of his. Now he felt that it was possibly at him that they would make Odette laugh. ""What a fetid form of humour!"" he exclaimed, twisting his mouth into an expression of disgust so violent that he could feel the muscles of his throat stiffen against his collar. ""How, in God's name, can a creature made in His image find anything to laugh at in those nauseating witticisms? The least sensitive nose must be driven away in horror from such stale exhalations. It is really impossible to believe that any human being is incapable of understanding that, in allowing herself merely to smile at the expense of a fellow-creature who has loyally held out his hand to her, she is casting herself into a mire from which it will be impossible, with the best will in the world, ever to rescue her. I dwell so many miles above the puddles in which these filthy little vermin sprawl and crawl and bawl their cheap obscenities, that I cannot possibly be spattered by the witticisms of a Verdurin!"" he cried, tossing up his head and arrogantly straightening his body. ""God knows that I have honestly attempted to pull Odette out of that sewer, and to teach her to breathe a nobler and a purer air. But human patience has its limits, and mine is at an end,"" he concluded, as though this sacred mission to tear Odette away from an atmosphere of sarcasms dated from longer than a few minutes ago, as though he had not undertaken it only since it had occurred to him that those sarcasms might, perchance, be directed at himself, and might have the effect of detaching Odette from him

   He could see the pianist sitting down to play the Moonlight Sonata, and the grimaces of Mme. Verdurin, in terrified anticipation of the wrecking of her nerves by Beethoven's music. ""Idiot, liar!"" he shouted, ""and a creature like that imagines that she's fond of Art!"" She would say to Odette, after deftly insinuating a few words of praise for Forcheville, as she had so often done for himself: ""You can make room for M. de Forcheville there, can't you, Odette?""... '""In the dark!' Codfish! Pander!""... 'Pander' was the name he applied also to the music which would invite them to sit in silence, to dream together, to gaze in each other's eyes, to feel for each other's hands. He felt that there was much to be said, after all, for a sternly censorous attitude towards the arts, such as Plato adopted, and Bossuet, and the old school of education in France

   In a word, the life which they led at the Verdurins', which he had so often described as 'genuine,' seemed to him now the worst possible form of life, and their 'little nucleus' the most degraded class of society. ""It really is,"" he repeated, ""beneath the lowest rung of the social ladder, the nethermost circle of Dante. Beyond a doubt, the august words of the Florentine refer to the Verdurins! When one comes to think of it, surely people 'in society' (and, though one may find fault with them now and then, still, after all they are a very different matter from that gang of blackmailers) shew a profound sagacity in refusing to know them, or even to dirty the tips of their fingers with them. What a sound intuition there is in that 'Noli me tangere' motto of the Faubourg Saint-Germain.""

   He had long since emerged from the paths and avenues of the Bois, he had almost reached his own house, and still, for he had not yet thrown off the intoxication of grief, or his whim of insincerity, but was ever more and more exhilarated by the false intonation, the artificial sonority of his own voice, he continued to perorate aloud in the silence of the night: ""People 'in society' have their failings, as no one knows better than I; but, after all, they are people to whom some things, at least, are impossible. So-and-so"" (a fashionable woman whom he had known) ""was far from being perfect, but, after all, one did find in her a fundamental delicacy, a loyalty in her conduct which made her, whatever happened, incapable of a felony, which fixes a vast gulf between her and an old hag like Verdurin. Verdurin! What a name! Oh, there's something complete about them, something almost fine in their trueness to type; they're the most perfect specimens of their disgusting class! Thank God, it was high time that I stopped condescending to promiscuous intercourse with such infamy, such dung.""

   But, just as the virtues which he had still attributed, an hour or so earlier, to the Verdurins, would not have sufficed, even although the Verdurins had actually possessed them, if they had not also favoured and protected his love, to excite Swann to that state of intoxication in which he waxed tender over their magnanimity, an intoxication which, even when disseminated through the medium of other persons, could have come to him from Odette alone;—so the immorality (had it really existed) which he now found in the Verdurins would have been powerless, if they had not invited Odette with Forcheville and without him, to unstop the vials of his wrath and to make him scarify their 'infamy.' Doubtless Swann's voice shewed a finer perspicacity than his own when it refused to utter those words full of disgust at the Verdurins and their circle, and of joy at his having shaken himself free of it, save in an artificial and rhetorical tone, and as though his words had been chosen rather to appease his anger than to express his thoughts. The latter, in fact, while he abandoned himself to invective, were probably, though he did not know it, occupied with a wholly different matter, for once he had reached his house, no sooner had he closed the front-door behind him than he suddenly struck his forehead, and, making his servant open the door again, dashed out into the street shouting, in a voice which, this time, was quite natural; ""I believe I have found a way of getting invited to the dinner at Chatou to-morrow!"" But it must have been a bad way, for M. Swann was not invited; Dr. Cottard, who, having been summoned to attend a serious case in the country, had not seen the Verdurins for some days, and had been prevented from appearing at Chatou, said, on the evening after this dinner, as he sat down to table at their house:

   ""Why, aren't we going to see M. Swann this evening? He is quite what you might call a personal friend..."" ""I sincerely trust that we sha'n't!"" cried Mme. Verdurin. ""Heaven preserve us from him; he's too deadly for words, a stupid, ill-bred boor.""

   On hearing these words Cottard exhibited an intense astonishment blended with entire submission, as though in the face of a scientific truth which contradicted everything that he had previously believed, but was supported by an irresistible weight of evidence; with timorous emotion he bowed his head over his plate, and merely replied: ""Oh—oh—oh—oh—oh!"" traversing, in an orderly retirement of his forces, into the depths of his being, along a descending scale, the whole compass of his voice. After which there was no more talk of Swann at the Verdurins'

                                _______________________________

   And so that drawing-room which had brought Swann and Odette together became an obstacle in the way of their meeting. She no longer said to him, as she had said in the early days of their love: ""We shall meet, anyhow, to-morrow evening; there's a supper-party at the Verdurins',"" but ""We sha'n't be able to meet to-morrow evening; there's a supper-party at the Verdurins'."" Or else the Verdurins were taking her to the Opéra-Comique, to see Une Nuit de Cléopâtre, and Swann could read in her eyes that terror lest he should ask her not to go, which, but a little time before, he could not have refrained from greeting with a kiss as it flitted across the face of his mistress, but which now exasperated him. ""Yet I'm not really angry,"" he assured himself, ""when I see how she longs to run away and scratch from maggots in that dunghill of cacophony. I'm disappointed; not for myself, but for her; disappointed to find that, after living for more than six months in daily contact with myself, she has not been capable of improving her mind even to the point of spontaneously eradicating from it a taste for Victor Massé! More than that, to find that she has not arrived at the stage of understanding that there are evenings on which anyone with the least shade of refinement of feeling should be willing to forego an amusement when she is asked to do so. She ought to have the sense to say: 'I shall not go,' if it were only from policy, since it is by what she answers now that the quality of her soul will be determined once and for all."" And having persuaded himself that it was solely, after all, in order that he might arrive at a favourable estimate of Odette's spiritual worth that he wished her to stay at home with him that evening instead of going to the Opéra-Comique, he adopted the same line of reasoning with her, with the same degree of insincerity as he had used with himself, or even with a degree more, for in her case he was yielding also to the desire to capture her by her own self-esteem

   ""I swear to you,"" he told her, shortly before she was to leave for the theatre, ""that, in asking you not to go, I should hope, were I a selfish man, for nothing so much as that you should refuse, for I have a thousand other things to do this evening, and I shall feel that I have been tricked and trapped myself, and shall be thoroughly annoyed, if, after all, you tell me that you are not going. But my occupations, my pleasures are not everything; I must think of you also. A day may come when, seeing me irrevocably sundered from you, you will be entitled to reproach me with not having warned you at the decisive hour in which I felt that I was going to pass judgment on you, one of those stern judgments which love cannot long resist. You see, your Nuit de Cléopâtre (what a title!) has no bearing on the point. What I must know is whether you are indeed one of those creatures in the lowest grade of mentality and even of charm, one of those contemptible creatures who are incapable of foregoing a pleasure. For if you are such, how could anyone love you, for you are not even a person, a definite, imperfect, but at least perceptible entity. You are a formless water that will trickle down any slope that it may come upon, a fish devoid of memory, incapable of thought, which all its life long in its aquarium will continue to dash itself, a hundred times a day, against a wall of glass, always mistaking it for water. Do you realise that your answer will have the effect—I do not say of making me cease from that moment to love you, that goes without saying, but of making you less attractive to my eyes when I realise that you are not a person, that you are beneath everything in the world and have not the intelligence to raise yourself one inch higher? Obviously, I should have preferred to ask you, as though it had been a matter of little or no importance, to give up your Nuit de Cléopâtre (since you compel me to sully my lips with so abject a name), in the hope that you would go to it none the less. But, since I had resolved to weigh you in the balance, to make so grave an issue depend upon your answer, I considered it more honourable to give you due warning.""

   Meanwhile, Odette had shewn signs of increasing emotion and uncertainty. Although the meaning of his tirade was beyond her, she grasped that it was to be included among the scenes of reproach or supplication, scenes which her familiarity with the ways of men enabled her, without paying any heed to the words that were uttered, to conclude that men would not make unless they were in love; that, from the moment when they were in love, it was superfluous to obey them, since they would only be more in love later on. And so, she would have heard Swann out with the utmost tranquillity had she not noticed that it was growing late, and that if he went on speaking for any length of time she would ""never"" as she told him with a fond smile, obstinate but slightly abashed, ""get there in time for the Overture.""

   On other occasions he had assured himself that the one thing which, more than anything else, would make him cease to love her, would be her refusal to abandon the habit of lying. ""Even from the point of view of coquetry, pure and simple,"" he had told her, ""can't you see how much of your attraction you throw away when you stoop to lying? By a frank admission—how many faults you might redeem! Really, you are far less intelligent than I supposed!"" In vain, however, did Swann expound to her thus all the reasons that she had for not lying; they might have succeeded in overthrowing any universal system of mendacity, but Odette had no such system; she contented herself, merely, whenever she wished Swann to remain in ignorance of anything that she had done, with not telling him of it. So that a lie was, to her, something to be used only as a special expedient; and the one thing that could make her decide whether she should avail herself of a lie or not was a reason which, too, was of a special and contingent order, namely the risk of Swann's discovering that she had not told him the truth

   Physically, she was passing through an unfortunate phase; she was growing stouter, and the expressive, sorrowful charm, the surprised, wistful expressions which she had formerly had, seemed to have vanished with her first youth, with the result that she became most precious to Swann at the very moment when he found her distinctly less good-looking. He would gaze at her for hours on end, trying to recapture the charm which he had once seen in her and could not find again. And yet the knowledge that, within this new and strange chrysalis, it was still Odette that lurked, still the same volatile temperament, artful and evasive, was enough to keep Swann seeking, with as much passion as ever, to captivate her. Then he would look at photographs of her, taken two years before, and would remember how exquisite she had been. And that would console him, a little, for all the sufferings that he voluntarily endured on her account

   When the Verdurins took her off to Saint-Germain, or to Chatou, or to Meulan, as often as not, if the weather was fine, they would propose to remain there for the night, and not go home until next day. Mme. Verdurin would endeavour to set at rest the scruples of the pianist, whose aunt had remained in Paris: ""She will be only too glad to be rid of you for a day. How on earth could she be anxious, when she knows you're with us? Anyhow, I'll take you all under my wing; she can put the blame on me.""

   If this attempt failed, M. Verdurin would set off across country until he came to a telegraph office or some other kind of messenger, after first finding out which of the 'faithful' had anyone whom they must warn. But Odette would thank him, and assure him that she had no message for anyone, for she had told Swann, once and for all, that she could not possibly send messages to him, before all those people, without compromising herself. Sometimes she would be absent for several days on end, when the Verdurins took her to see the tombs at Dreux, or to Compiègne, on the painter's advice, to watch the sun setting through the forest—after which they went on to the Château of Pierrefonds

   ""To think that she could visit really historic buildings with me, who have spent ten years in the study of architecture, who am constantly bombarded, by people who really count, to take them over Beauvais or Saint-Loup-de-Naud, and refuse to take anyone but her; and instead of that she trundles off with the lowest, the most brutally degraded of creatures, to go into ecstasies over the petrified excretions of Louis-Philippe and Viollet-le-Duc! One hardly needs much knowledge of art, I should say, to do that; though, surely, even without any particularly refined sense of smell, one would not deliberately choose to spend a holiday in the latrines, so as to be within range of their fragrant exhalations.""

   But when she had set off for Dreux or Pierrefonds—alas, without allowing him to appear there, as though by accident, at her side, for, as she said, that would ""create a dreadful impression,""—he would plunge into the most intoxicating romance in the lover's library, the railway timetable, from which he learned the ways of joining her there in the afternoon, in the evening, even in the morning. The ways? More than that, the authority, the right to join her. For, after all, the time-table, and the trains themselves, were not meant for dogs. If the public were carefully informed, by means of printed advertisements, that at eight o'clock in the morning a train started for Pierrefonds which arrived there at ten, that could only be because going to Pierrefonds was a lawful act, for which permission from Odette would be superfluous; an act, moreover, which might be performed from a motive altogether different from the desire to see Odette, since persons who had never even heard of her performed it daily, and in such numbers as justified the labour and expense of stoking the engines

   So it came to this; that she could not prevent him from going to Pierrefonds if he chose to do so. Now that was precisely what he found that he did choose to do, and would at that moment be doing were he, like the travelling public, not acquainted with Odette. For a long time past he had wanted to form a more definite impression of Viollet-le-Duc's work as a restorer. And the weather being what it was, he felt an overwhelming desire to spend the day roaming in the forest of Compiègne

   It was, indeed, a piece of bad luck that she had forbidden him access to the one spot that tempted him to-day. To-day! Why, if he went down there, in defiance of her prohibition, he would be able to see her that very day! But then, whereas, if she had met, at Pierrefonds, some one who did not matter, she would have hailed him with obvious pleasure: ""What, you here?"" and would have invited him to come and see her at the hotel where she was staying with the Verdurins, if, on the other hand, it was himself, Swann, that she encountered there, she would be annoyed, would complain that she was being followed, would love him less in consequence, might even turn away in anger when she caught sight of him. ""So, then, I am not to be allowed to go away for a day anywhere!"" she would reproach him on her return, whereas in fact it was he himself who was not allowed to go

   He had had the sudden idea, so as to contrive to visit Compiègne and Pierrefonds without letting it be supposed that his object was to meet Odette, of securing an invitation from one of his friends, the Marquis de Forestelle, who had a country house in that neighbourhood. This friend, to whom Swann suggested the plan without disclosing its ulterior purpose, was beside himself with joy; he did not conceal his astonishment at Swann's consenting at last, after fifteen years, to come down and visit his property, and since he did not (he told him) wish to stay there, promised to spend some days, at least, in taking him for walks and excursions in the district. Swann imagined himself down there already with M. de Forestelle. Even before he saw Odette, even if he did not succeed in seeing her there, what a joy it would be to set foot on that soil where, not knowing the exact spot in which, at any moment, she was to be found, he would feel all around him the thrilling possibility of her suddenly appearing: in the courtyard of the Château, now beautiful in his eyes since it was on her account that he had gone to visit it; in all the streets of the town, which struck him as romantic; down every ride of the forest, roseate with the deep and tender glow of sunset;—innumerable and alternative hiding-places, to which would fly simultaneously for refuge, in the uncertain ubiquity of his hopes, his happy, vagabond and divided heart. ""We mustn't, on any account,"" he would warn M. de Forestelle, ""run across Odette and the Verdurins. I have just heard that they are at Pierrefonds, of all places, to-day. One has plenty of time to see them in Paris; it would hardly be worth while coming down here if one couldn't go a yard without meeting them."" And his host would fail to understand why, once they had reached the place, Swann would change his plans twenty times in an hour, inspect the dining-rooms of all the hotels in Compiègne without being able to make up his mind to settle down in any of them, although he had found no trace anywhere of the Verdurins, seeming to be in search of what he had claimed to be most anxious to avoid, and would in fact avoid, the moment he found it, for if he had come upon the little 'group,' he would have hastened away at once with studied indifference, satisfied that he had seen Odette and she him, especially that she had seen him when he was not, apparently, thinking about her. But no; she would guess at once that it was for her sake that he had come there. And when M. de Forestelle came to fetch him, and it was time to start, he excused himself: ""No, I'm afraid not; I can't go to Pierrefonds to-day. You see, Odette is there."" And Swann was happy in spite of everything in feeling that if he, alone among mortals, had not the right to go to Pierrefonds that day, it was because he was in fact, for Odette, some one who differed from all other mortals, her lover; and because that restriction which for him alone was set upon the universal right to travel freely where one would, was but one of the many forms of that slavery, that love which was so dear to him. Decidedly, it was better not to risk a quarrel with her, to be patient, to wait for her return. He spent his days in poring over a map of the forest of Compiègne, as though it had been that of the 'Pays du Tendre'; he surrounded himself with photographs of the Château of Pierrefonds. When the day dawned on which it was possible that she might return, he opened the time-table again, calculated what train she must have taken, and, should she have postponed her departure, what trains were still left for her to take. He did not leave the house, for fear of missing a telegram, he did not go to bed, in case, having come by the last train, she decided to surprise him with a midnight visit. Yes! The front-door bell rang. There seemed some delay in opening the door, he wanted to awaken the porter, he leaned out of the window to shout to Odette, if it was Odette, for in spite of the orders which he had gone downstairs a dozen times to deliver in person, they were quite capable of telling her that he was not at home. It was only a servant coming in. He noticed the incessant rumble of passing carriages, to which he had never before paid any attention. He could hear them, one after another, a long way off, coming nearer, passing his door without stopping, and bearing away into the distance a message which was not for him. He waited all night, to no purpose, for the Verdurins had returned unexpectedly, and Odette had been in Paris since midday; it had not occurred to her to tell him; not knowing what to do with herself she had spent the evening alone at a theatre, had long since gone home to bed, and was peacefully asleep

   As a matter of fact, she had never given him a thought. And such moments as these, in which she forgot Swann's very existence, were of more value to Odette, did more to attach him to her, than all her infidelities. For in this way Swann was kept in that state of painful agitation which had once before been effective in making his interest blossom into love, on the night when he had failed to find Odette at the Verdurins' and had hunted for her all evening. And he did not have (as I had, afterwards, at Combray in my childhood) happy days in which to forget the sufferings that would return with the night. For his days, Swann must pass them without Odette; and as he told himself, now and then, to allow so pretty a woman to go out by herself in Paris was just as rash as to leave a case filled with jewels in the middle of the street. In this mood he would scowl furiously at the passers-by, as though they were so many pickpockets. But their faces—a collective and formless mass—escaped the grasp of his imagination, and so failed to feed the flame of his jealousy. The effort exhausted Swann's brain, until, passing his hand over his eyes, he cried out: ""Heaven help me!"" as people, after lashing themselves into an intellectual frenzy in their endeavours to master the problem of the reality of the external world, or that of the immortality of the soul, afford relief to their weary brains by an unreasoning act of faith. But the thought of his absent mistress was incessantly, indissolubly blended with all the simplest actions of Swann's daily life—when he took his meals, opened his letters, went for a walk or to bed—by the fact of his regret at having to perform those actions without her; like those initials of Philibert the Fair which, in the church of Brou, because of her grief, her longing for him, Margaret of Austria intertwined everywhere with her own. On some days, instead of staying at home, he would go for luncheon to a restaurant not far off, to which he had been attracted, some time before, by the excellence of its cookery, but to which he now went only for one of those reasons, at once mystical and absurd, which people call 'romantic'; because this restaurant (which, by the way, still exists) bore the same name as the street in which Odette lived: the Lapérouse. Sometimes, when she had been away on a short visit somewhere, several days would elapse before she thought of letting him know that she had returned to Paris. And then she would say quite simply, without taking (as she would once have taken) the precaution of covering herself, at all costs, with a little fragment borrowed from the truth, that she had just, at that very moment, arrived by the morning train. What she said was a falsehood; at least for Odette it was a falsehood, inconsistent, lacking (what it would have had, if true) the support of her memory of her actual arrival at the station; she was even prevented from forming a mental picture of what she was saying, while she said it, by the contradictory picture, in her mind, of whatever quite different thing she had indeed been doing at the moment when she pretended to have been alighting from the train. In Swann's mind, however, these words, meeting no opposition, settled and hardened until they assumed the indestructibility of a truth so indubitable that, if some friend happened to tell him that he had come by the same train and had not seen Odette, Swann would have been convinced that it was his friend who had made a mistake as to the day or hour, since his version did not agree with the words uttered by Odette. These words had never appeared to him false except when, before hearing them, he had suspected that they were going to be. For him to believe that she was lying, an anticipatory suspicion was indispensable. It was also, however, sufficient. Given that, everything that Odette might say appeared to him suspect. Did she mention a name: it was obviously that of one of her lovers; once this supposition had taken shape, he would spend weeks in tormenting himself; on one occasion he even approached a firm of 'inquiry agents' to find out the address and the occupation of the unknown rival who would give him no peace until he could be proved to have gone abroad, and who (he ultimately learned) was an uncle of Odette, and had been dead for twenty years

   Although she would not allow him, as a rule, to meet her at public gatherings, saying that people would talk, it happened occasionally that, at an evening party to which he and she had each been invited—at Forcheville's, at the painter's, or at a charity ball given in one of the Ministries—he found himself in the same room with her. He could see her, but dared not remain for fear of annoying her by seeming to be spying upon the pleasures which she tasted in other company, pleasures which—while he drove home in utter loneliness, and went to bed, as anxiously as I myself was to go to bed, some years later, on the evenings when he came to dine with us at Combray—seemed illimitable to him since he had not been able to see their end. And, once or twice, he derived from such evenings that kind of happiness which one would be inclined (did it not originate in so violent a reaction from an anxiety abruptly terminated) to call peaceful, since it consists in a pacifying of the mind: he had looked in for a moment at a revel in the painter's studio, and was getting ready to go home; he was leaving behind him Odette, transformed into a brilliant stranger, surrounded by men to whom her glances and her gaiety, which were not for him, seemed to hint at some voluptuous pleasure to be enjoyed there or elsewhere (possibly at the Bal des Incohérents, to which he trembled to think that she might be going on afterwards) which made Swann more jealous than the thought of their actual physical union, since it was more difficult to imagine; he was opening the door to go, when he heard himself called back in these words (which, by cutting off from the party that possible ending which had so appalled him, made the party itself seem innocent in retrospect, made Odette's return home a thing no longer inconceivable and terrible, but tender and familiar, a thing that kept close to his side, like a part of his own daily life, in his carriage; a thing that stripped Odette herself of the excess of brilliance and gaiety in her appearance, shewed that it was only a disguise which she had assumed for a moment, for his sake and not in view of any mysterious pleasures, a disguise of which she had already wearied)—in these words, which Odette flung out after him as he was crossing the threshold: ""Can't you wait a minute for me? I'm just going; we'll drive back together and you can drop me."" It was true that on one occasion Forcheville had asked to be driven home at the same time, but when, on reaching Odette's gate, he had begged to be allowed to come in too, she had replied, with a finger pointed at Swann: ""Ah! That depends on this gentleman. You must ask him. Very well, you may come in, just for a minute, if you insist, but you mustn't stay long, for, I warn you, he likes to sit and talk quietly with me, and he's not at all pleased if I have visitors when he's here. Oh, if you only knew the creature as I know him; isn't that so, my love, there's no one that really knows you, is there, except me?""

   And Swann was, perhaps, even more touched by the spectacle of her addressing him thus, in front of Forcheville, not only in these tender words of predilection, but also with certain criticisms, such as: ""I feel sure you haven't written yet to your friends, about dining with them on Sunday. You needn't go if you don't want to, but you might at least be polite,"" or ""Now, have you left your essay on Vermeer here, so that you can do a little more to it to-morrow? What a lazy-bones! I'm going to make you work, I can tell you,"" which proved that Odette kept herself in touch with his social engagements and his literary work, that they had indeed a life in common. And as she spoke she bestowed on him a smile which he interpreted as meaning that she was entirely his

   And then, while she was making them some orangeade, suddenly, just as when the reflector of a lamp that is badly fitted begins by casting all round an object, on the wall beyond it, huge and fantastic shadows which, in time, contract and are lost in the shadow of the object itself, all the terrible and disturbing ideas which he had formed of Odette melted away and vanished in the charming creature who stood there before his eyes. He had the sudden suspicion that this hour spent in Odette's house, in the lamp-light, was, perhaps, after all, not an artificial hour, invented for his special use (with the object of concealing that frightening and delicious thing which was incessantly in his thoughts without his ever being able to form a satisfactory impression of it, an hour of Odette's real life, of her life when he was not there, looking on) with theatrical properties and pasteboard fruits, but was perhaps a genuine hour of Odette's life; that, if he himself had not been there, she would have pulled forward the same armchair for Forcheville, would have poured out for him, not any unknown brew, but precisely that orangeade which she was now offering to them both; that the world inhabited by Odette was not that other world, fearful and supernatural, in which he spent his time in placing her—and which existed, perhaps, only in his imagination, but the real universe, exhaling no special atmosphere of gloom, comprising that table at which he might sit down, presently, and write, and this drink which he was being permitted, now, to taste; all the objects which he contemplated with as much curiosity and admiration as gratitude, for if, in absorbing his dreams, they had delivered him from an obsession, they themselves were, in turn, enriched by the absorption; they shewed him the palpable realisation of his fancies, and they interested his mind; they took shape and grew solid before-his eyes, and at the same time they soothed his troubled heart. Ah! had fate but allowed him to share a single dwelling with Odette, so that in her house he should be in his own; if, when asking his servant what there would be for luncheon, it had been Odette's bill of fare that he had learned from the reply; if, when Odette wished to go for a walk, in the morning, along the Avenue du Bois-de-Boulogne, his duty as a good husband had obliged him, though he had no desire to go out, to accompany her, carrying her cloak when she was too warm; and in the evening, after dinner, if she wished to stay at home, and not to dress, if he had been forced to stay beside her, to do what she asked; then how completely would all the trivial details of Swann's life, which seemed to him now so gloomy, simply because they would, at the same time, have formed part of the life of Odette, have taken on—like that lamp, that orangeade, that armchair, which had absorbed so much of his dreams, which materialised so much of his longing,—a sort of superabundant sweetness and a mysterious solidity

   And yet he was inclined to suspect that the state for which he so much longed was a calm, a peace, which would not have created an atmosphere favourable to his love. When Odette ceased to be for him a creature always absent, regretted, imagined; when the feeling that he had for her was no longer the same mysterious disturbance that was wrought in him by the phrase from the sonata, but constant affection and gratitude, when those normal relations were established between them which would put an end to his melancholy madness; then, no doubt, the actions of Odette's daily life would appear to him as being of but little intrinsic interest—as he had several times, already, felt that they might be, on the day, for instance, when he had read, through its envelope, her letter to Forcheville. Examining his complaint with as much scientific detachment as if he had inoculated himself with it in order to study its effects, he told himself that, when he was cured of it, what Odette might or might not do would be indifferent to him. But in his morbid state, to tell the truth, he feared death itself no more than such a recovery, which would, in fact, amount to the death of all that he then was

   After these quiet evenings, Swann's suspicions would be temporarily lulled; he would bless the name of Odette, and next day, in the morning, would order the most attractive jewels to be sent to her, because her kindnesses to him overnight had excited either his gratitude, or the desire to see them repeated, or a paroxysm of love for her which had need of some such outlet

   But at other times, grief would again take hold of him; he would imagine that Odette was Forcheville's mistress, and that, when they had both sat watching him from the depths of the Verdurins' landau, in the Bois, on the evening before the party at Chatou to which he had not been invited, while he implored her in vain, with that look of despair on his face which even his coachman had noticed, to come home with him, and then turned away, solitary, crushed,—she must have employed, to draw Forcheville's attention to him, while she murmured: ""Do look at him, storming!"" the same glance, brilliant, malicious, sidelong, cunning, as on the evening when Forcheville had driven Saniette from the Verdurins'

   At such times Swann detested her. ""But I've been a fool, too,"" he would argue. ""I'm paying for other men's pleasures with my money. All the same, she'd better take care, and not pull the string too often, for I might very well stop giving her anything at all. At any rate, we'd better knock off supplementary favours for the time being. To think that, only yesterday, when she said she would like to go to Bayreuth for the season, I was such an ass as to offer to take one of those jolly little places the King of Bavaria has there, for the two of us. However she didn't seem particularly keen; she hasn't said yes or no yet. Let's hope that she'll refuse. Good God! Think of listening to Wagner for a fortnight on end with her, who takes about as much interest in music as a fish does in little apples; it will be fun!"" And his hatred, like his love, needing to manifest itself in action, he amused himself with urging his evil imaginings further and further, because, thanks to the perfidies with which he charged Odette, he detested her still more, and would be able, if it turned out—as he tried to convince himself—that she was indeed guilty of them, to take the opportunity of punishing her, emptying upon her the overflowing vials of his wrath. In this way, he went so far as to suppose that he was going to receive a letter from her, in which she would ask him for money to take the house at Bayreuth, but with the warning that he was not to come there himself, as she had promised Forcheville and the Verdurins to invite them. Oh, how he would have loved it, had it been conceivable that she would have that audacity. What joy he would have in refusing, in drawing up that vindictive reply, the terms of which he amused himself by selecting and declaiming aloud, as though he had actually received her letter

   The very next day, her letter came. She wrote that the Verdurins and their friends had expressed a desire to be present at these performances of Wagner, and that, if he would be so good as to send her the money, she would be able at last, after going so often to their house, to have the pleasure of entertaining the Verdurins in hers. Of him she said not a word; it was to be taken for granted that their presence at Bayreuth would be a bar to his

   Then that annihilating answer, every word of which he had carefully rehearsed overnight, without venturing to hope that it could ever be used, he had the satisfaction of having it conveyed to her. Alas! he felt only too certain that with the money which she had, or could easily procure, she would be able, all the same, to take a house at Bayreuth, since she wished to do so, she who was incapable of distinguishing between Bach and Clapisson. Let her take it, then; she would have to live in it more frugally, that was all. No means (as there would have been if he had replied by sending her several thousand-franc notes) of organising, each evening, in her hired castle, those exquisite little suppers, after which she might perhaps be seized by the whim (which, it was possible, had never yet seized her) of falling into the arms of Forcheville. At any rate, this loathsome expedition, it would not be Swann who had to pay for it. Ah! if he could only manage to prevent it, if she could sprain her ankle before starting, if the driver of the carriage which was to take her to the station would consent (no matter how great the bribe) to smuggle her to some place where she could be kept for a time in seclusion, that perfidious woman, her eyes tinselled with a smile of complicity for Forcheville, which was what Odette had become for Swann in the last forty-eight hours

   But she was never that for very long; after a few days the shining, crafty eyes lost their brightness and their duplicity, that picture of an execrable Odette saying to Forcheville: ""Look at him storming!"" began to grow pale and to dissolve. Then gradually reappeared and rose before him, softly radiant, the face of the other Odette, of that Odette who al^o turned with a smile to Forcheville, but with a smile in which there was nothing but affection for Swann, when she said: ""You mustn't stay long, for this gentleman doesn't much like my having visitors when he's here. Oh! if you only knew the creature as I know him!"" that same smile with which she used to thank Swann for some instance of his courtesy which she prized so highly, for some advice for which she had asked him in one of those grave crises in her life, when she could turn to him alone

   Then, to this other Odette, he would ask himself what could have induced him to write that outrageous letter, of which, probably, until then, she had never supposed him capable, a letter which must have lowered him from the high, from the supreme place which, by his generosity, by his loyalty, he had won for himself in her esteem. He would become less dear to her, since it was for those qualities, which she found neither in Forcheville nor in any other, that she loved him. It was for them that Odette so often shewed him a reciprocal kindness, which counted for less than nothing in his moments of jealousy, because it was not a sign of reciprocal desire, was indeed a proof rather of affection than of love, but the importance of which he began once more to feel in proportion as the spontaneous relaxation of his suspicions, often accelerated by the distraction brought to him by reading about art or by the conversation of a friend, rendered his passion less exacting of reciprocities

   Now that, after this swing of the pendulum, Odette had naturally returned to the place from which Swann's jealousy had for the moment driven her, in the angle in which he found her charming, he pictured her to himself as full of tenderness, with a look of consent in her eyes, and so beautiful that he could not refrain from moving his lips towards her, as though she had actually been in the room for him to kiss; and he preserved a sense of gratitude to her for that bewitching, kindly glance, as strong as though she had really looked thus at him, and it had not been merely his imagination that had portrayed it in order to satisfy his desire

   What distress he must have caused her! Certainly he found adequate reasons for his resentment, but they would not have been sufficient to make him feel that resentment, if he had not so passionately loved her. Had he not nourished grievances, just as serious, against other women, to whom he would, none the less, render willing service to-day, feeling no anger towards them because he no longer loved them? If the day ever came when he would find himself in the same state of indifference with regard to Odette, he would then understand that it was his jealousy alone which had led him to find something atrocious, unpardonable, in this desire (after all, so natural a desire, springing from a childlike ingenuousness and also from a certain delicacy in her nature) to be able, in her turn, when an occasion offered, to repay the Verdurins for their hospitality, and to play the hostess in a house of her own

   He returned to the other point of view—opposite to that of his love and of his jealousy, to which he resorted at times by a sort of mental equity, and in order to make allowance for different eventualities—from which he tried to form a fresh judgment of Odette, based on the supposition that he had never been in love with her, that she was to him just a woman like other women, that her life had not been (whenever he himself was not present) different, a texture woven in secret apart from him, and warped against him

   Wherefore believe that she would enjoy down there with Forcheville or with other men intoxicating pleasures which she had never known with him, and which his jealousy alone had fabricated in all their elements? At Bayreuth, as in Paris, if it should happen that Forcheville thought of him at all, it would only be as of some one who counted for a great deal in the life of Odette, some one for whom he was obliged to make way, when they met in her house. If Forcheville and she scored a triumph by being down there together in spite of him, it was he who had engineered that triumph by striving in vain to prevent her from going there, whereas if he had approved of her plan, which for that matter was quite defensible, she would have had the appearance of being there by his counsel, she would have felt herself sent there, housed there by him, and for the pleasure which she derived from entertaining those people who had so often entertained her, it was to him that she would have had to acknowledge her indebtedness

   And if—instead of letting her go off thus, at cross-purposes with him, without having seen him again—he were to send her this money, if he were to encourage her to take this journey, and to go out of his way to make it comfortable and pleasant for her, she would come running to him, happy, grateful, and he would have the joy—the sight of her face—which he had not known for nearly a week, a joy which none other could replace. For the moment that Swann was able to form a picture of her without revulsion, that he could see once again the friendliness in her smile, and that the desire to tear her away from every rival was no longer imposed by his jealousy upon his love, that love once again became, more than anything, a taste for the sensations which Odette's person gave him, for the pleasure which he found in admiring, as one might a spectacle, or in questioning, as one might a phenomenon, the birth of one of her glances, the formation of one of her smiles, the utterance of an intonation of her voice. And this pleasure, different from every other, had in the end created in him a need of her, which she alone, by her presence or by her letters, could assuage, almost as disinterested, almost as artistic, as perverse as another need which characterised this new period in Swann's life, when the sereness, the depression of the preceding years had been followed by a sort of spiritual superabundance, without his knowing to what he owed this unlooked-for enrichment of his life, any more than a person in delicate health who from a certain moment grows stronger, puts on flesh, and seems for a time to be on the road to a complete recovery:—this other need, which, too, developed in him independently of the visible, material world, was the need to listen to music and to learn to know it

   And so, by the chemical process of his malady, after he had created jealousy out of his love, he began again to generate tenderness, pity for Odette. She had become once more the old Odette, charming and kind. He was full of remorse for having treated her harshly. He wished her to come to him, and, before she came, he wished to have already procured for her some pleasure, so as to watch her gratitude taking shape in her face and moulding her smile

   So, too, Odette, certain of seeing him come to her in a few days, as tender and submissive as before, and plead with her for a reconciliation, became inured, was no longer afraid of displeasing him, or even of making him angry, and refused him, whenever it suited her, the favours by which he set most store

   Perhaps she did not realise how sincere he had been with her during their quarrel, when he had told her that he would not send her any money, but would do what he could to hurt her. Perhaps she did not realise, either, how sincere he still was, if not with her, at any rate with himself, on other occasions when, for the sake of their future relations, to shew Odette that he was capable of doing without her, that a rupture was still possible between them, he decided to wait some time before going to see her again

   Sometimes several days had elapsed, during which she had caused him no fresh anxiety; and as, from the next few visits which he would pay her, he knew that he was likely to derive not any great pleasure, but, more probably, some annoyance which would put an end to the state of calm in which he found himself, he wrote to her that he was very busy, and would not be able to see her on any of the days that he had suggested. Meanwhile, a letter from her, crossing his, asked him to postpone one of those very meetings. He asked himself, why; his suspicions, his grief, again took hold of him. He could no longer abide, in the new state of agitation into which he found himself plunged, by the arrangements which he had made in his preceding state of comparative calm; he would run to find her, and would insist upon seeing her on each of the following days. And even if she had not written first, if she merely acknowledged his letter, it was enough to make him unable to rest without seeing her. For, upsetting all Swann's calculations, Odette's acceptance had entirely changed his attitude. Like everyone who possesses something precious, so as to know what would happen if he ceased for a moment to possess it, he had detached the precious object from his mind, leaving, as he thought, everything else in the same state as when it was there. But the absence of one part from a whole is not only that, it is not simply a partial omission, it is a disturbance of all the other parts, a new state which it was impossible to foresee from the old

   But at other times—when Odette was on the point of going away for a holiday—it was after some trifling quarrel for which he had chosen the pretext, that he decided not to write to her and not to see her until her return, giving the appearance (and expecting the reward) of a serious rupture, which she would perhaps regard as final, to a separation, the greater part of which was inevitable, since she was going away, which, in fact, he was merely allowing to start a little sooner than it must. At once he could imagine Odette, puzzled, anxious, distressed at having received neither visit nor letter from him and this picture of her, by calming his jealousy, made it easy for him to break himself of the habit of seeing her. At odd moments, no doubt, in the furthest recesses of his brain, where his determination had thrust it away, and thanks to the length of the interval, the three weeks' separation to which he had agreed, it was with pleasure that he would consider the idea that he would see Odette again on her return; but it was also with so little impatience that he began to ask himself whether he would not readily consent to the doubling of the period of so easy an abstinence. It had lasted, so far, but three days, a much shorter time than he had often, before, passed without seeing Odette, and without having, as on this occasion he had, premeditated a separation. And yet, there and then, some tiny trace of contrariety in his mind, or of weakness in his body,—by inciting him to regard the present as an exceptional moment, one not to be governed by the rules, one in which prudence itself would allow him to take advantage of the soothing effects of a pleasure and to give his will (until the time should come when its efforts might serve any purpose) a holiday—suspended the action of his will, which ceased to exert its inhibitive control; or, without that even, the thought of some information for which he had forgotten to ask Odette, such as if she had decided in what colour she would have her carriage repainted, or, with regard to some investment, whether they were 'ordinary' or 'preference' shares that she wished him to buy (for it was all very well to shew her that he could live without seeing her, but if, after that, the carriage had to be painted over again, if the shares produced no dividend, a fine lot of good he would have done),—and suddenly, like a stretched piece of elastic which is let go, or the air in a pneumatic machine which is ripped open, the idea of seeing her again, from the remote point in time to which it had been attached, sprang back into the field of the present and of immediate possibilities

   It sprang back thus without meeting any further resistance, so irresistible, in fact, that Swann had been far less unhappy in watching the end gradually approaching, day by day, of the fortnight which he must spend apart from Odette, than he was when kept waiting ten minutes while his coachman brought round the carriage which was to take him to her, minutes which he passed in transports of impatience and joy, in which he recaptured a thousand times over, to lavish on it all the wealth of his affection, that idea of his meeting with Odette, which, by so abrupt a repercussion, at a moment when he supposed it so remote, was once more present and on the very surface of his consciousness. The fact was that this idea no longer found, as an obstacle in its course, the desire to contrive without further delay to resist its coming, which had ceased to have any place in Swann's mind since, having proved to himself—or so, at least, he believed—that he was so easily capable of resisting it, he no longer saw any inconvenience in postponing a plan of separation which he was now certain of being able to put into operation whenever he would. Furthermore, this idea of seeing her again came back to him adorned with a novelty, a seductiveness, armed with a virulence, all of which long habit had enfeebled, but which had acquired new vigour during this privation, not of three days but of a fortnight (for a period of abstinence may be calculated, by anticipation, as having lasted already until the final date assigned to it), and had converted what had been, until then, a pleasure in store, which could easily be sacrificed, into an unlooked-for happiness which he was powerless to resist. Finally, the idea returned to him with its beauty enhanced by his own ignorance of what Odette might have thought, might, perhaps, have done on finding that he shewed no sign of life, with the result that he was going now to meet with the entrancing revelation of an Odette almost unknown

   But she, just as she had supposed that his refusal to send her money was only a feint, saw nothing but a pretext in the question which he came, now, to ask her, about the repainting of her carriage, or the purchase of stock. For she could not reconstruct the several phases of these crises through which he passed, and in the general idea which she formed of them she made no attempt to understand their mechanism, looking only to what she knew beforehand, their necessary, never-failing and always identical termination. An imperfect idea (though possibly all the more profound in consequence), if one were to judge it from the point of view of Swann, who would doubtless have considered that Odette failed to understand him, just as a morphinomaniac or a consumptive, each persuaded that he has been thrown back, one by some outside event, at the moment when he was just going to shake himself free from his inveterate habit, the other by an accidental indisposition at the moment when he was just going to be finally cured, feels himself to be misunderstood by the doctor who does not attach the same importance to these pretended contingencies, mere disguises, according to him, assumed, so as to be perceptible by his patients, by the vice of one and the morbid state of the other, which in reality have never ceased to weigh heavily and incurably upon them while they were nursing their dreams of normality and health. And, as a matter of fact, Swann's love had reached that stage at which the physician and (in the case of certain affections) the boldest of surgeons ask themselves whether to deprive a patient of his vice or to rid him of his malady is still reasonable, or indeed possible

   Certainly, of the extent of this love Swann had no direct knowledge. When he sought to measure it, it happened sometimes that he found it diminished, shrunken almost to nothing; for instance, the very moderate liking, amounting almost to dislike, which, in the days before he was in love with Odette, he had felt for her expressive features, her faded complexion, returned on certain days. ""Really, I am making distinct headway,"" he would tell himself on the morrow, ""when I come to think it over carefully, I find out that I got hardly any pleasure, last night, out of being in bed with her; it's an odd thing, but I actually thought her ugly."" And certainly he was sincere, but his love extended a long way beyond the province of physical desire. Odette's person, indeed, no longer held any great place in it. When his eyes fell upon the photograph of Odette on his table, or when she came to see him, he had difficulty in identifying her face, either in the flesh or on the pasteboard, with the painful and continuous anxiety which dwelt in his mind. He would say to himself, almost with astonishment, ""It is she!"" as when suddenly some one shews us in a detached, externalised form one of our own maladies, and we find in it no resemblance to what we are suffering. ""She?""—he tried to ask himself what that meant; for it is something like love, like death (rather than like those vague conceptions of maladies), a thing which one repeatedly calls in question, in order to make oneself probe further into it, in the fear that the question will find no answer, that the substance will escape our grasp—the mystery of personality. And this malady, which was Swann's love, had so far multiplied, was so closely interwoven with all his habits, with all his actions, with his thoughts, his health, his sleep, his life, even with what he hoped for after his death, was so entirely one with him that it would have been impossible to wrest it away without almost entirely destroying him; as surgeons say, his case was past operation

   By this love Swann had been so far detached from all other interests that when by chance he reappeared in the world of fashion, reminding himself that his social relations, like a beautifully wrought setting (although she would not have been able to form any very exact estimate of its worth), might, still, add a little to his own value in Odette's eyes (as indeed they might have done had they not been cheapened by his love itself, which for Odette depreciated everything that it touched by seeming to denounce such things as less precious than itself), he would feel there, simultaneously with his distress at being in places and among people that she did not know, the same detached sense of pleasure as he would have derived from a novel or a painting in which were depicted the amusements of a leisured class; just as, at home, he used to enjoy the thought of the smooth efficiency of his household, the smartness of his own wardrobe and of his servants' liveries, the soundness of his investments, with the same relish as when he read in Saint-Simon, who was one of his favourite authors, of the machinery of daily life at Versailles, what Mme. de Maintenon ate and drank, or the shrewd avarice and great pomp of Lulli. And in the small extent to which this detachment was not absolute, the reason for this new pleasure which Swann was tasting was that he could emigrate for a moment into those few and distant parts of himself which had remained almost foreign to his love and to his pain. In this respect the personality, with which my great-aunt endowed him, of 'young Swann,' as distinct from the more individual personality of Charles Swann, was that in which he now most delighted. Once when, because it was the birthday of the Princesse de Parme (and because she could often be of use, indirectly, to Odette, by letting her have seats for galas and jubilees and all that sort of thing), he had decided to send her a basket of fruit, and was not quite sure where or how to order it, he had entrusted the task to a cousin of his mother who, delighted to be doing a commission for him, had written to him, laying stress on the fact that she had not chosen all the fruit at the same place, but the grapes from Crapote, whose speciality they were, the straw berries from Jauret, the pears from Chevet, who always had the best, am soon, ""every fruit visited and examined, one by one, by myself."" And ii the sequel, by the cordiality with which the Princess thanked him, hi had been able to judge of the flavour of the strawberries and of the ripe ness of the pears. But, most of all, that ""every fruit visited and examinee one by one, by myself"" had brought balm to his sufferings by carrying hi mind off to a region which he rarely visited, although it was his by right, as the heir of a rich and respectable middle-class family in which had been handed down from generation to generation the knowledge of the 'right places' and the art of ordering things from shops

   Of a truth, he had too long forgotten that he was 'young Swann' not to feel, when he assumed that part again for a moment, a keener pleasure than he was capable of feeling at other times—when, indeed, he was grown sick of pleasure; and if the friendliness of the middle-class people, for whom he had never been anything else than 'young Swann,' was less animated than that of the aristocrats (though more flattering, for all that, since in the middle-class mind friendship is inseparable from respect), no letter from a Royal Personage, offering him some princely entertainment, could ever be so attractive to Swann as the letter which asked him to be a witness, or merely to be present at a wedding in the family of some old friends of his parents; some of whom had 'kept up' with him, like my grandfather, who, the year before these events, had invited him to my mother's wedding, while others barely knew him by sight, but were, they thought, in duty bound to shew civility to the son, to the worthy successor of the late M. Swann

   But, by virtue of his intimacy, already time-honoured, with so many of them, the people of fashion, in a certain sense, were also a part of his house, his service, and his family. He felt, when his mind dwelt upon his brilliant connections, the same external support, the same solid comfort as when he looked at the fine estate, the fine silver, the fine table-linen which had come down to him from his forebears. And the thought that, if he were seized by a sudden illness and confined to the house, the people whom his valet would instinctively run to find would be the Duc de Chartres, the Prince de Reuss, the Duc de Luxembourg and the Baron de Charlus, brought him the same consolation as our old Françoise derived from the knowledge that she would, one day, be buried in her own fine clothes, marked with her name, not darned at all (or so exquisitely darned that it merely enhanced one's idea of the skill and patience of the seamstress), a shroud from the constant image of which in her mind's eye she drew a certain satisfactory sense, if not actually of wealth and prosperity, at any rate of self-esteem. But most of all,—since in every one of his actions and thoughts which had reference to Odette, Swann was constantly subdued and swayed by the unconfessed feeling that he was, perhaps not less dear, but at least less welcome to her than anyone, even the most wearisome of the Verdurins' 'faithful,'—when he betook himself to a world in which he was the paramount example of taste, a man whom no pains were spared to attract, whom people were genuinely sorry not to see, he began once again to believe in the existence of a happier life, almost to feel an appetite for it, as an invalid may feel who has been in bed for months and on a strict diet, when he picks up a newspaper and reads the account of an official banquet or the advertisement of a cruise round Sicily

   If he was obliged to make excuses to his fashionable friends for not paying them visits, it was precisely for the visits that he did pay her that he sought to excuse himself to Odette. He still paid them (asking himself at the end of each month whether, seeing that he had perhaps exhausted her patience, and had certainly gone rather often to see her, it would be enough if he sent her four thousand francs), and for each visit he found a pretext, a present that he had to bring her, some information which she required, M. de Charlus, whom he had met actually going to her house, and who had insisted upon Swann's accompanying him. And, failing any excuse, he would beg M. de Charlus to go to her at once, and to tell her, as though spontaneously, in the course of conversation, that he had just remembered something that he had to say to Swann, and would she please send a message to Swann's house asking him to come to her then and there; but as a rule Swann waited at home in vain, and M. de Charlus informed him, later in the evening, that his device had not proved successful. With the result that, if she was now frequently away from Paris, even when she was there he scarcely saw her; that she who, when she was in love with him, used to say, ""I am always free"" and ""What can it matter to me, what other people think?"" now, whenever he wanted to see her, appealed to the proprieties or pleaded some engagement. When he spoke of going to a charity entertainment, or a private view, or a first-night at which she was to be present, she would expostulate that he wished to advertise their relations in public, that he was treating her like a woman off the streets. Things came to such a pitch that, in an effort to save himself from being altogether forbidden to meet her anywhere, Swann, remembering that she knew and was deeply attached to my great-uncle Adolphe, whose friend he himself also had been, went one day to see him in his little flat in the Rue de Bellechasse, to ask him to use his influence with Odette. As it happened, she invariably adopted, when she spoke to Swann about my uncle, a poetical tone, saying: ""Ah, he! He is not in the least like you; it is an exquisite thing, a great, a beautiful thing, his friendship for me. He's not the sort of man who would have so little consideration for me as to let himself be seen with me everywhere in public."" This was embarrassing for Swann, who did not know quite to what rhetorical pitch he should screw himself up in speaking of Odette to my uncle. He began by alluding to her excellence, a priori, the axiom of her seraphic super-humanity, the revelation of her inexpressible virtues, no conception of which could possibly be formed. ""I should like to speak to you about her,"" he went on, ""you, who know what a woman supreme above all women, what an adorable being, what an angel Odette is. But you know, also, what life is in Paris. Everyone doesn't see Odette in the light in which you and I have been Privileged to see her. And so there are people who think that I am behaving rather foolishly; she won't even allow me to meet her out of doors, at the theatre. Now you, in whom she has such enormous confidence, couldn't you say a few words for me to her, just to assure her that she exaggerate the harm which my bowing to her in the street might do her?""

   My uncle advised Swann not to see Odette for some days, after which she would love him all the more; he advised Odette to let Swann meet her everywhere, and as often as he pleased. A few days later Odette told Swann that she had just had a rude awakening; she had discovered that my uncle was the same as other men; he had tried to take her by assault. She calmed Swann, who, at first, was for rushing out to challenge my uncle to a duel, but he refused to shake hands with him when they met again. He regretted this rupture all the more because he had hoped, if he had met my uncle Adolphe again sometimes and had contrived to talk things over with him in strict confidence, to be able to get him to throw a light on certain rumours with regard to the life that Odette had led, in the old days, at Nice. For my uncle Adolphe used to spend the winter there, and Swann thought that it might indeed have been there, perhaps, that he had first known Odette. The few words which some one had let fall, in his hearing, about a man who, it appeared, had been Odette's lover, had left Swann dumbfounded. But the very things which he would, before knowing them, have regarded as the most terrible to learn and the most impossible to believe, were, once he knew them, incorporated for all time in the general mass of his sorrow; he admitted them, he could no longer have understood their not existing. Only, each one of them in its passage traced an indelible line, altering the picture that he had formed of his mistress. At one time indeed he felt that he could understand that this moral 'lightness,' of which he would never have suspected Odette, was perfectly well known, and that at Baden or Nice, when she had gone, in the past, to spend several months in one or the other place, she had enjoyed a sort of amorous notoriety. He attempted, in order to question them, to get into touch again with certain men of that stamp; but these were aware that he knew Odette, and, besides, he was afraid of putting the thought of her into their heads, of setting them once more upon her track. But he, to whom, up till then, nothing could have seemed so tedious as was all that pertained to the cosmopolitan life of Baden or of Nice, now that he learned that Odette had, perhaps, led a 'gay' life once in those pleasure-cities, although he could never find out whether it had been solely to satisfy a want of money which, thanks to himself, she no longer felt, or from some capricious instinct which might, at any moment, revive in her, he would lean, in impotent anguish, blinded and dizzy, over the bottomless abyss into which had passed, in which had been engulfed those years of his own, early in MacMahon's Septennat, in which one spent the winter on the Promenade des Anglais, the summer beneath the limes of Baden, and would find in those years a sad but splendid profundity, such as a poet might have lent to them; and he would have devoted to the reconstruction of all the insignificant details that made up the daily round on the Côte d'Azur in those days, if it could have helped him to understand something that still baffled him in the smile or in the eyes of Odette, more enthusiasm than does the aesthete who ransacks the extant documents of fifteenth-century Florence, so as to try to penetrate further into the soul of the Primavera, the fair Vanna or the Venus of Botticelli. He would sit, often, without saying a word to her, only gazing at her and dreaming; and she would comment: ""You do look sad!"" It was not very long since, from the idea that she was an excellent creature, comparable to the best women that he had known, he had passed to that of her being 'kept'; and yet already, by an inverse process, he had returned from the Odette de Crécy, perhaps too well known to the holiday-makers, to the 'ladies' men' of Nice and Baden, to this face, the expression on which was so often gentle, to this nature so eminently human. He would ask himself: ""What does it mean, after all, to say that everyone at Nice knows who Odette de Crécy is? Reputations of that sort, even when they're true, are always based upon other people's ideas""; he would reflect that this legend—even if it were authentic—was something external to Odette, was not inherent in her like a mischievous and ineradicable personality; that the creature who might have been led astray was a woman with frank eyes, a heart full of pity for the sufferings of others, a docile body which he had pressed tightly in his arms and explored with his fingers, a woman of whom he might one day come into absolute possession if he succeeded in making himself indispensable to her. There she was, often tired, her face left blank for the nonce by that eager, feverish preoccupation with the unknown things which made Swann suffer; she would push back her hair with both hands; her forehead, her whole face would seem to grow larger; then, suddenly, some ordinary human thought, some worthy sentiment such as is to be found in all creatures when, in a moment of rest or meditation, they are free to express themselves, would flash out from her eyes like a ray of gold. And immediately the whole of her face would light up like a grey landscape, swathed in clouds which, suddenly, are swept away and the dull scene transfigured, at the moment of the sun's setting. The life which occupied Odette at such times, even the future which she seemed to be dreamily regarding, Swann could have shared with her. No evil disturbance seemed to have left any effect on them. Rare as they became, those moments did not occur in vain. By the process of memory, Swann joined the fragments together, abolished the intervals between them, cast, as in molten gold, the image of an Odette compact of kindness and tranquillity, for whom he was to make, later on (as we shall see in the second part of this story) sacrifices which the other Odette would never have won from him. But how rare those moments were, and how seldom he now saw her! Even in regard to their evening meetings, she would never tell him until the last minute whether she would be able to see him, for, reckoning on his being always free, she wished first to be certain that no one else would offer to come to her. She would plead that she was obliged to wait for an answer which was of the very greatest importance, and if, even after she had made Swann come to her house, any of her friends asked her, half-way through the evening, to join them at some theatre, or at supper afterwards, she would jump for joy and dress herself with all speed. As her toilet progressed, every movement that she made brought Swann nearer to the moment when he would have to part from her, when she would fly off with irresistible force; and when at length she was ready, and, Plunging into her mirror a last glance strained and brightened by her anxiety to look well, smeared a little salve on her lips, fixed a stray loci of hair over her brow, and called for her cloak of sky-blue silk with golden tassels, Swann would be looking so wretched that she would be unable to restrain a gesture of impatience as she flung at him: ""So that is how you thank me for keeping you here till the last minute! And I thought I was being so nice to you. Well, I shall know better another time!"" Sometime... at the risk of annoying her, he made up his mind that he would find out where she had gone, and even dreamed of a defensive alliance with Forcheville, who might perhaps have been able to tell him. But anyhow, when he knew with whom she was spending the evening, it was very seldom that he could not discover, among all his innumerable acquaintance, some one who knew—if only indirectly—the man with whom she had gone out, and could easily obtain this or that piece of information about him. And while he was writing to one of his friends, asking him to try to get a little light thrown upon some point or other, he would feel a sense of relief on ceasing to vex himself with questions to which there was no answer and transferring to some one else the strain of interrogation. It is true that Swann was little the wiser for such information as he did receive. To know a thing does not enable us, always, to prevent its happening, but after all the things that we know we do hold, if not in our hands, at any rate in our minds, where we can dispose of them as we choose, which gives us the illusion of a sort of power to control them. He was quite happy whenever M. de Charlus was with Odette. He knew that between M. de Charlus and her nothing untoward could ever happen, that when M. de Charlus went anywhere with her, it was out of friendship for himself, and that he would make no difficulty about telling him everything that she had done. Sometimes she had declared so emphatically to Swann that it was impossible for him to see her on a particular evening, she seemed to be looking forward so keenly to some outing, that Swann attached a very real importance to the fact that M. de Charlus was free to accompany her. Next day, without daring to put many questions to M. de Charlus, he would force him, by appearing not quite to understand his first answers, to give him more, after each of which he would feel himself increasingly relieved, for he very soon learned that Odette had spent her evening in the most innocent of dissipations

   ""But what do you mean, my dear Mémé, I don't quite understand.... You didn't go straight from her house to the Musée Grévin? Surely you went somewhere else first? No? That is very odd! You don't know how amusing you are, my dear Mémé. But what an odd idea of hers to go on to the Chat Noir afterwards; it was her idea, I suppose? No? Yours? That's strange. After all, it wasn't a bad idea; she must have known dozens of people there? No? She never spoke to a soul? How extraordinary! Then you sat there like that, just you and she, all by yourselves? I can picture you, sitting there! You are a worthy fellow, my dear Mémé; I'm exceedingly fond of you.""

   Swann was now quite at ease. To him, who had so often happened, when talking to friends who knew nothing of his love, friends to whom he hardly listened, to hear certain detached sentences (as, for instance, ""I saw Mme. de Crécy yesterday; she was with a man I didn't know.""), sentences which dropped into his heart and passed at once into a solid state, grew hard as stalagmites, and seared and tore him as they lay there irremovable,—how charming, by way of contrast, were the words: ""She didn't know a soul; she never spoke to a soul."" How freely they coursed through him, how fluid they were, how vaporous, how easy to breathe! And yet, a moment later, he was telling himself that Odette must find him very dull if those were the pleasures that she preferred to his company. And their very insignificance, though it reassured him, pained him as if her enjoyment of them had been an act of treachery

   Even when he could not discover where she had gone, it would have sufficed to alleviate the anguish that he then felt, for which Odette's presence, the charm of her company, was the sole specific (a specific which in the long run served, like many other remedies, to aggravate the disease, but at least brought temporary relief to his sufferings), it would have sufficed, had Odette only permitted him to remain in her house while she was out, to wait there until that hour of her return, into whose stillness and peace would flow, to be mingled and lost there, all memory of those intervening hours which some sorcery, some cursed spell had made him imagine as, somehow, different from the rest. But she would not; he must return home; he forced himself, on the way, to form various plans, ceased to think of Odette; he even reached the stage, while he undressed, of turning over all sorts of happy ideas in his mind: it was with a light heart, buoyed with the anticipation of going to see some favourite work of art on the morrow, that he jumped into bed and turned out the light; but no sooner had he made himself ready to sleep, relaxing a self-control of which he was not even conscious, so habitual had it become, than an icy shudder convulsed his body and he burst into sobs. He did not wish to know why, but dried his eyes, saying with a smile: ""This is delightful; I'm becoming neurasthenic."" After which he could not save himself from utter exhaustion at the thought that, next day, he must begin afresh his attempt to find out what Odette had been doing, must use all his influence to contrive to see her. This compulsion to an activity without respite, without variety, without result, was so cruel a scourge that one day, noticing a swelling over his stomach, he felt an actual joy in the idea that he had, perhaps, a tumour which would prove fatal, that he need not concern himself with anything further, that it was his malady which was going to govern his life, to make a plaything of him, until the not-distant end. If indeed, at this period, it often happened that, though without admitting it even to himself, he longed for death, it was in order to escape not so much from the keenness of his sufferings as from the monotony of his struggle

   And yet he would have wished to live until the time came when he no longer loved her, when she would have no reason for lying to him, when at length he might learn from her whether, on the day when he had gone to see her in the afternoon, she had or had not been in the arms of Forcheville. Often for several days on end the suspicion that she was in love with some one else would distract his mind from the question of Forcheville, making it almost immaterial to him, like those new developments of a continuous state of ill-health which seem for a little time to have delivered us from their predecessors. There were even days when he was not tormented by any suspicion. He fancied that he was cured. But next morning, when he awoke, he felt in the same place the same pain, a sensation which, the day before, he had, as it were, diluted in the torrent of different impressions. But it had not stirred from its place. Indeed, it was the sharpness of this pain that had awakened him

   Since Odette never gave him any information as to those vastly important matters which took up so much of her time every day (albeit he had lived long enough in the world to know that such matters are never anything else than pleasures) he could not sustain for any length of time the effort to imagine them; his brain would become a void; then he would pass a finger over his tired eyelids, in the same way as he might have wiped his eyeglass, and would cease altogether to think. There emerged, however, from this unexplored tract, certain occupations which reappeared from time to time, vaguely connected by Odette with some obligation towards distant relatives or old friends who, inasmuch as they were the only people whom she was in the habit of mentioning as preventing her from seeing him, seemed to Swann to compose the necessary, unalterable setting of her life. Because of the tone in which she referred, from time to time, to ""the day when I go with my friend to the Hippodrome,"" if, when he felt unwell and had thought, ""Perhaps Odette would be kind and come to see me,"" he remembered, suddenly, that it was one of those very days, he would correct himself with an ""Oh, no! It's not worth while asking her to come; I should have thought of it before, this is the day when she goes with her friend to the Hippodrome. We must confine ourselves to what is possible; no use wasting our time in proposing things that can't be accepted and are declined in advance."" And this duty that was incumbent upon Odette, of going to the Hippodrome, to which Swann thus gave way, seemed to him to be not merely ineluctable in itself; but the mark of necessity which stamped it seemed to make plausible and legitimate everything that was even remotely connected with it. If, when Odette, in the street, had acknowledged the salute of a passer-by, which had aroused Swann's jealousy, she replied to his questions by associating the stranger with any of the two or three paramount duties of which she had often spoken to him; if, for instance, she said: ""That's a gentleman who was in my friend's box the other day; the one I go to the Hippodrome with,"" that explanation would set Swann's suspicions at rest; it was, after all, inevitable that this friend should have other guests than Odette in her box at the Hippodrome, but he had never sought to form or succeeded in forming any coherent impression of them. Oh! how he would have loved to know her, that friend who went to the Hippodrome, how he would have loved her to invite him there with Odette. How readily he would have sacrificed all his acquaintance for no matter what person who was in the habit of seeing Odette, were she but a manicurist or a girl out of a shop. He would have taken more trouble, incurred more expense for them than for queens. Would they not have supplied him, out of what was contained in their knowledge of the life of Odette, with the one potent anodyne for his pain? With what joy would he have hastened to spend his days with one or other of those humble folk with whom Odette kept up friendly relations, either with some ulterior motive or from genuine simplicity of nature. How willingly would he have fixed his abode for ever in the attics of some sordid but enviable house, where Odette went but never took him, and where, if he had lived with the little retired dressmaker, whose lover he would readily have pretended to be, he would have been visited by Odette almost daily. In those regions, that were almost slums, what a modest existence, abject, if you please, but delightful, nourished by tranquillity and happiness, he would have consented to lead indefinitely

   It sometimes happened, again, that, when, after meeting Swann, she saw some man approaching whom he did not know, he could distinguish upon Odette's face that look of sorrow which she had worn on the day when he had come to her while Forcheville was there. But this was rare; for, on the days when, in spite of all that she had to do, and of her dread of what people would think, she did actually manage to see Swann, the predominant quality in her attitude, now, was self-assurance; a striking contrast, perhaps an unconscious revenge for, perhaps a natural reaction from the timorous emotion which, in the early days of their friendship, she had felt in his presence, and even in his absence, when she began a letter to him with the words: ""My dear, my hand trembles so that I can scarcely write."" (So, at least, she pretended, and a little of that emotion must have been sincere, or she would not have been anxious to enlarge and emphasise it.) So Swann had been pleasing to her then. Our hands do not tremble except for ourselves, or for those whom we love. When they have ceased to control our happiness how peaceful, how easy, how bold do we become in their presence! In speaking to him, in writing to him now, she no longer employed those words by which she had sought to give herself the illusion that he belonged to her, creating opportunities for saying ""my"" and ""mine"" when she referred to him: ""You are all that I have in the world; it is the perfume of our friendship, I shall keep it,"" nor spoke to him of the future, of death itself, as of a single adventure which they would have to share. In those early days, whatever he might say to her, she would answer admiringly: ""You know, you will never be like other people!""—she would gaze at his long, slightly bald head, of which people who know only of his successes used to think: ""He's not regularly good-looking, if you like, but he is smart; that tuft, that eyeglass, that smile!"" and, with more curiosity perhaps to know him as he really was than desire to become his mistress, she would sigh:

   ""I do wish I could find out what there is in that head of yours!""

   But, now, whatever he might say, she would answer, in a tone sometimes of irritation, sometimes indulgent: ""Ah! so you never will be like other people!""

   She would gaze at his head, which was hardly aged at all by his recent anxieties (though people now thought of it, by the same mental process which enables one to discover the meaning of a piece of symphonic music of which one has read the programme, or the 'likenesses' in a child whose family one has known: ""He's not positively ugly, if you like, but he is really rather absurd; that eyeglass, that tuft, that smile!"" realising in their imagination, fed by suggestion, the invisible boundary which divides, at a few months' interval, the head of an ardent lover from a cuckold's), and would say:

   ""Oh, I do wish I could change you; put some sense into that head of yours.""

   Always ready to believe in the truth of what he hoped, if it was only Odette's way of behaving to him that left room for doubt, he would fling himself greedily upon her words: ""You can if you like,"" he would tell her

   And he tried to explain to her that to comfort him, to control him, to make him work would be a noble task, to which numbers of other women asked for nothing better than to be allowed to devote themselves, though it is only fair to add that in those other women's hands the noble task would have seemed to Swann nothing more than an indiscreet and intolerable usurpation of his freedom of action. ""If she didn't love me, just a little,"" he told himself, ""she would not wish to have me altered. To alter me, she will have to see me more often."" And so he was able to trace, in these faults which she found in him, a proof at least of her interest, perhaps even of her love; and, in fact, she gave him so little, now, of the last, that he was obliged to regard as proofs of her interest in him the various things which, every now and then, she forbade him to do. One day she announced that she did not care for his coachman, who, she thought, was perhaps setting Swann against her, and, anyhow, did not shew that promptness and deference to Swann's orders which she would have liked to see. She felt that he wanted to hear her say: ""Don't have him again when you come to me,"" just as he might have wanted her to kiss him. So, being in a good temper, she said it; and he was deeply moved. That evening, when talking to M. de Charlus, with whom he had the satisfaction of being able to speak of her openly (for the most trivial remarks that he uttered now, even to people who had never heard of her, had always some sort of reference to Odette), he said to him:

   ""I believe, all the same, that she loves me; she is so nice to me now, and she certainly takes an interest in what I do.""

   And if, when he was starting off for her house, getting into his carriage with a friend whom he was to drop somewhere on the way, his friend said: ""Hullo! that isn't Loredan on the box?"" with what melancholy joy would Swann answer him:

   ""Oh! Good heavens, no! I can tell you, I daren't take Loredan when I go to the Rue La Pérouse; Odette doesn't like me to have Loredan, she thinks he doesn't suit me. What on earth is one to do? Women, you know, women. My dear fellow, she would be furious. Oh, lord, yes; I've only to take Rémi there; I should never hear the last of it!""

   These new manners, indifferent, listless, irritable, which Odette now adopted with Swann, undoubtedly made him suffer; but he did not realise how much he suffered; since it had been with a regular progression, day after day, that Odette had chilled towards him, it was only by directly contrasting what she was to-day with what she had been at first that he could have measured the extent of the change that had taken place. Now this change was his deep, his secret wound, which pained him day and night, and whenever he felt that his thoughts were straying too near it, he would quickly turn them into another channel for fear of being made to suffer too keenly. He might say to himself in a vague way: ""There was a time when Odette loved me more,"" but he never formed any definite picture of that time. Just as he had in his study a cupboard at which he contrived never to look, which he turned aside to avoid passing whenever he entered or left the room, because in one of its drawers he had locked away the chrysanthemum which she had given him on one of those first evenings when he had taken her home in his carriage, and the letters in which she said: ""Why did you not forget your heart also? I should never have let you have that back,"" and ""At whatever hour of the day or night you may need me, just send me a word, and dispose of me as you please,"" so there was a place in his heart to which he would never allow his thoughts to trespass too near, forcing them, if need be, to evade it by a long course of reasoning so that they should not have to pass within reach of it; the place in which lingered his memories of happy days

   But his so meticulous prudence was defeated one evening when he had gone out to a party

   It was at the Marquise de Saint-Euverte's, on the last, for that season, of the evenings on which she invited people to listen to the musicians who would serve, later on, for her charity concerts. Swann, who had intended to go to each of the previous evenings in turn, but had never been able to make up his mind, received, while he was dressing for this party, a visit from the Baron de Charlus, who came with an offer to go with him to the Marquise's, if his company could be of any use in helping Swann not to feel quite so bored when he got there, to be a little less unhappy. But Swann had thanked him with:

   ""You can't conceive how glad I should be of your company. But the greatest pleasure that you can give me will be if you will go instead to see Odette. You know what a splendid influence you have over her. I don't suppose she'll be going anywhere this evening, unless she goes to see her old dressmaker, and I'm sure she would be delighted if you went with her there. In any case, you'll find her at home before then. Try to keep her amused, and also to give her a little sound advice. If you could arrange something for to-morrow which would please her, something that we could all three do together. Try to put out a feeler, too, for the summer; see if there's anything she wants to do, a cruise that we might all three take; anything you can think of. I don't count upon seeing her to-night, myself; still if she would like me to come, or if you find a loophole, you've only to send me a line at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's up till midnight; after that I shall be here. Ever so many thanks for all you are doing for me—you know what I feel about you!""

   His friend promised to go and do as Swann wished as soon as he had deposited him at the door of the Saint-Euverte house, where he arrived soothed by the thought that M. de Charlus would be spending the evening in the Rue La Pérouse, but in a state of melancholy indifference to everything that did not involve Odette, and in particular to the details of fashionable life, a state which invested them with the charm that is to be found in anything which, being no longer an object of our desire, appears to us in its own guise. On alighting from his carriage, in the foreground of that fictitious summary of their domestic existence which hostesses are pleased to offer to their guests on ceremonial occasions, and in which they shew a great regard for accuracy of costume and setting, Swann was amused to discover the heirs and successors of Balzac's 'tigers'—now 'grooms'—. who normally followed their mistress when she walked abroad, but now, hatted and booted, were posted out of doors, in front of the house on the gravelled drive, or outside the stables, as gardeners might be drawn up for inspection at the ends of their several flower-beds. The peculiar tendency which he had always had to look for analogies between living people and the portraits in galleries reasserted itself here, but in a more positive and more general form; it was society as a whole, now that he was detached from it, which presented itself to him in a series of pictures. In the cloak-room, into which, in the old days, when he was still a man of fashion, he would have gone in his overcoat, to emerge from it in evening dress, but without any impression of what had occurred there, his mind having been, during the minute or two that he had spent in it, either still at the party which he had just left, or already at the party into which he was just about to be ushered, he now noticed, for the first time, roused by the unexpected arrival of so belated a guest, the scattered pack of splendid effortless animals, the enormous footmen who were drowsing here and there upon benches and chests, until, pointing their noble greyhound profiles, they towered upon their feet and gathered in a circle round about him

   One of them, of a particularly ferocious aspect, and not unlike the headsman in certain Renaissance pictures which represent executions, tortures, and the like, advanced upon him with an implacable air to take his 'things.' But the harshness of his steely glare was compensated by the softness of his cotton gloves, so effectively that, as he approached Swann, he seemed to be exhibiting at once an utter contempt for his person and the most tender regard for his hat. He took it with a care to which the precision of his movements imparted something that was almost over-fastidious, and with a delicacy that was rendered almost touching by the evidence of his splendid strength. Then he passed it to one of his satellites, a novice and timid, who was expressing the panic that overpowered him by casting furious glances in every direction, and displayed all the dumb agitation of a wild animal in the first hours of its captivity

   A few feet away, a strapping great lad in livery stood musing, motionless, statuesque, useless, like that purely decorative warrior whom one sees in the most tumultuous of Mantegna's paintings, lost in dreams, leaning upon his shield, while all around him are fighting and bloodshed and death; detached from the group of his companions who were thronging about Swann, he seemed as determined to remain unconcerned in the scene, which he followed vaguely with his cruel, greenish eyes, as if it had been the Massacre of the Innocents or the Martyrdom of Saint James. He seemed precisely to have sprung from that vanished race—if, indeed, it ever existed, save in the reredos of San Zeno and the frescoes of the Eremitani, where Swann had come in contact with it, and where it still dreams—fruit of the impregnation of a classical statue by some one of the Master's Paduan models, or of Albert Duerer's Saxons. And the locks of his reddish hair, crinkled by nature, but glued to his head by brilliantine, were treated broadly as they are in that Greek sculpture which the Mantuan painter never ceased to study, and which, if in its creator's purpose it represents but man, manages at least to extract from man's simple outlines such a variety of richness, borrowed, as it were, from the whole of animated nature, that a head of hair, by the glossy undulation and beak-like points of its curls, or in the overlaying of the florid triple diadem of its brushed tresses, can suggest at once a bunch of seaweed, a brood of fledgling doves, a bed of hyacinths and a serpent's writhing back. Others again, no less colossal, were disposed upon the steps of a monumental staircase which, by their decorative presence and marmorean immobility, was made worthy to be named, like that god-crowned ascent in the Palace of the Doges, the 'Staircase of the Giants,' and on which Swann now set foot, saddened by the thought that Odette had never climbed it. Ah, with what joy would he, on the other hand, have raced up the dark, evil-smelling, breakneck flights to the little dressmaker's, in whose attic he would so gladly have paid the price of a weekly stage-box at the Opera for the right to spend the evening there when Odette came, and other days too, for the privilege of talking about her, of living among people whom she was in the habit of seeing when he was not there, and who, on that account, seemed to keep secret among themselves some part of the life of his mistress more real, more inaccessible and more mysterious than anything that he knew. Whereas upon that pestilential, enviable staircase to the old dressmaker's, since there was no other, no service stair in the building, one saw in the evening outside every door an empty, unwashed milk-can set out, in readiness for the morning round, upon the door-mat; on the despicable, enormous staircase which Swann was at that moment climbing, on either side of him, at different levels, before each anfractuosity made in its walls by the window of the porter's lodge or the entrance to a set of rooms, representing the departments of indoor service which they controlled, and doing homage for them to the guests, a gate-keeper, a major-domo, a steward (worthy men who spent the rest of the week in semi-independence in their own domains, dined there by themselves like small shopkeepers, and might to-morrow lapse to the plebeian service of some successful doctor or industrial magnate), scrupulous in carrying out to the letter all the instructions that had been heaped upon them before they were allowed to don the brilliant livery which they wore only at long intervals, and in which they did not feel altogether at their ease, stood each in the arcade of his doorway, their splendid pomp tempered by a democratic good-fellowship, like saints in their niches, and a gigantic usher, dressed Swiss Guard fashion, like the beadle in a church, struck the pavement with his staff as each fresh arrival passed him. Coming to the top of the staircase, up which he had been followed by a servant with a pallid countenance and a small pigtail clubbed at the back of his head, like one of Goya's sacristans or a tabellion in an old play, Swann passed by an office in which the lackeys, seated like notaries before their massive registers, rose solemnly to their feet and inscribed his name. He next crossed a little hall which—just as certain rooms are arranged by their owners to serve as the setting for a single work of art (from which they take their name), and, in their studied bareness, contain nothing else besides—displayed to him as he entered it, like some priceless effigy by Benvenuto Cellini of an armed watchman, a young footman, his body slightly bent forward, rearing above his crimson gorget an even more crimson face, from which seemed to burst forth torrents of fire, timidity and zeal, who, as he pierced the Aubusson tapestries that screened the door of the room in which the music was being given with his impetuous, vigilant, desperate gaze, appeared, with a soldierly impassibility or a supernatural faith—an allegory of alarums, incarnation of alertness, commemoration of a riot—to be looking out, angel or sentinel, from the tower of dungeon or cathedral, for the approach of the enemy or for the hour of Judgment. Swann had now only to enter the concert-room, the doors of which were thrown open to him by an usher loaded with chains, who bowed low before him as though tendering to him the keys of a conquered city. But he thought of the house in which at that very moment he might have been, if Odette had but permitted, and the remembered glimpse of an empty milk-can upon a door-mat wrung his heart

   He speedily recovered his sense of the general ugliness of the human male when, on the other side of the tapestry curtain, the spectacle of the servants gave place to that of the guests. But even this ugliness of faces, which of course were mostly familiar to him, seemed something new and uncanny, now that their features,—instead of being to him symbols of practical utility in the identification of this or that man, who until then had represented merely so many pleasures to be sought after, boredoms to be avoided, or courtesies to be acknowledged—were at rest, measurable by aesthetic co-ordinates alone, in the autonomy of their curves and angles. And in these men, in the thick of whom Swann now found himself packed, there was nothing (even to the monocle which many of them wore, and which, previously, would, at the most, have enabled Swann to say that so-and-so wore a monocle) which, no longer restricted to the general connotation of a habit, the same in all of them, did not now strike him with a sense of individuality in each. Perhaps because he did not regard General de Froberville and the Marquis de Bréaute, who were talking together just inside the door, as anything more than two figures in a picture, whereas they were the old and useful friends who had put him up for the Jockey Club and had supported him in duels, the General's monocle, stuck like a shell-splinter in his common, scarred, victorious, overbearing face, in the middle of a forehead which it left half-blinded, like the single-eyed flashing front of the Cyclops, appeared to Swann as a monstrous wound which it might have been glorious to receive but which it was certainly not decent to expose, while that which M. de Bréaute wore, as a festive badge, with his pearl-grey gloves, his crush hat and white tie, substituting it for the familiar pair of glasses (as Swann himself did) when he went out to places, bore, glued to its other side, like a specimen prepared on a slide for the microscope, an infinitesimal gaze that swarmed with friendly feeling and never ceased to twinkle at the loftiness of ceilings, the delightfulness of parties, the interestingness of programmes and the excellence of refreshments

   ""Hallo! you here! why, it's ages since I've seen you,"" the General greeted Swann and, noticing the look of strain on his face and concluding that it was perhaps a serious illness that had kept him away, went on, ""You're looking well, old man!"" while M. de Bréauté turned with, ""My dear fellow, what on earth are you doing here?"" to a 'society novelist' who had just fitted into the angle of eyebrow and cheek his own monocle, the sole instrument that he used in his psychological investigations and remorseless analyses of character, and who now replied, with an air of mystery and importance, rolling the 'r':—""I am observing!""

   The Marquis de Forestelle's monocle was minute and rimless, and, by enforcing an incessant and painful contraction of the eye over which it was incrusted like a superfluous cartilage, the presence of which there was inexplicable and its substance unimaginable, it gave to his face a melancholy refinement, and led women to suppose him capable of suffering terribly when in love. But that of M. de Saint-Candé, girdled, like Saturn, with an enormous ring, was the centre of gravity of a face which composed itself afresh every moment in relation to the glass, while his thrusting red nose and swollen sarcastic lips endeavoured by their grimaces to rise to the level of the steady flame of wit that sparkled in the polished disk, and saw itself preferred to the most ravishing eyes in the world by the smart, depraved young women whom it set dreaming of artificial charms and a refinement of sensual bliss; and then, behind him, M. de Palancy, who with his huge carp's head and goggling eyes moved slowly up and down the stream of festive gatherings, unlocking his great mandibles at every moment as though in search of his orientation, had the air of carrying about upon his person only an accidental and perhaps purely symbolical fragment of the glass wall of his aquarium, a part intended to suggest the whole which recalled to Swann, a fervent admirer of Giotto's Vices and Virtues at Padua, that Injustice by whose side a leafy bough evokes the idea of the forests that enshroud his secret lair

   Swann had gone forward into the room, under pressure from Mme. de Saint-Euverte and in order to listen to an aria from Orfeo which was being rendered on the flute, and had taken up a position in a corner from which, unfortunately, his horizon was bounded by two ladies of 'uncertain' age, seated side by side, the Marquise de Cambremer and the Vicomtesse de Franquetot, who, because they were cousins, used to spend their time at parties in wandering through the rooms, each clutching her bag and followed by her daughter, hunting for one another like people at a railway station, and could never be at rest until they had reserved, by marking them with their fans or handkerchiefs, two adjacent chairs; Mme. de Cambremer, since she knew scarcely anyone, being all the more glad of a companion, while Mme. de Franquetot, who, on the contrary, was extremely popular, thought it effective and original to shew all her fine friends that she preferred to their company that of an obscure country cousin with whom she had childish memories in common. Filled with ironical melancholy, Swann watched them as they listened to the pianoforte intermezzo (Liszt's 'Saint Francis preaching to the birds') which came after the flute, and followed the virtuoso in his dizzy flight; Mme. de Franquetot anxiously, her eyes starting from her head, as though the keys over which his fingers skipped with such agility were a series of trapezes, from any one of which he might come crashing, a hundred feet, to the ground, stealing now and then a glance of astonishment and unbelief at her companion, as who should say: ""It isn't possible, I would never have believed that a human being could do all that!""; Mme. de Cambremer, as a woman who had received a sound musical education, beating time with her head—transformed for the nonce into the pendulum of a metronome, the sweep and rapidity of whose movements from one shoulder to the other (performed with that look of wild abandonment in her eye which a sufferer shews who is no longer able to analyse his pain, nor anxious to master it, and says merely ""I can't help it"") so increased that at every moment her diamond earrings caught in the trimming of her bodice, and she was obliged to put straight the bunch of black grapes which she had in her hair, though without any interruption of her constantly accelerated motion. On the other side (and a little way in front) of Mme. de Franquetot, was the Marquise de Gallardon, absorbed in her favourite meditation, namely upon her own kinship with the Guermantes family, from which she derived both publicly and in private a good deal of glory not unmingled with shame, the most brilliant ornaments of that house remaining somewhat aloof from her, perhaps because she was just a tiresome old woman, or because she was a scandalous old woman, or because she came of an inferior branch of the family, or very possibly for no reason at all. When she found herself seated next to some one whom she did not know, as she was at this moment next to Mme. de Franquetot, she suffered acutely from the feeling that her own consciousness of her Guermantes connection could not be made externally manifest in visible character like those which, in the mosaics in Byzantine churches, placed one beneath another, inscribe in a vertical column by the side of some Sacred Personage the words which he is supposed to be uttering. At this moment she was pondering the fact that she had never received an invitation, or even call, from her young cousin the Princesse des Laumes, during the six years that had already elapsed since the latter's marriage. The thought filled her with anger—and with pride; for, by virtue of having told everyone who expressed surprise at never seeing her at Mme. des Laumes's, that it was because of the risk of meeting the Princesse Mathilde there—a degradation which her own family, the truest and bluest of Legitimists, would never have forgiven her, she had come gradually to believe that this actually was the reason for her not visiting her young cousin. She remembered, it is true, that she had several times inquired of Mme. des Laumes how they might contrive to meet, but she remembered it only in a confused way, and besides did more than neutralise this slightly humiliating reminiscence by murmuring, ""After all, it isn't for me to take the first step; I am at least twenty years older than she is."" And fortified by these unspoken words she flung her shoulders proudly back until they seemed to part company with her bust, while her head, which lay almost horizontally upon them, made one think of the 'stuck-on' head of a pheasant which is brought to the table regally adorned with its feathers. Not that she in the least degree resembled a pheasant, having been endowed by nature with a short and squat and masculine figure; but successive mortifications had given her a backward tilt, such as one may observe in trees which have taken root on the very edge of a precipice and are forced to grow backwards to preserve their balance. Since she was obliged, in order to console herself for not being quite on a level with the rest of the Guermantes, to repeat to herself incessantly that it was owing to the uncompromising rigidity of her principles and pride that she saw so little of them, the constant iteration had gradually remoulded her body, and had given her a sort of 'bearing' which was accepted by the plebeian as a sign of breeding, and even kindled, at times, a momentary spark in the jaded eyes of old gentlemen in clubs. Had anyone subjected Mme. de Gallardon's conversation to that form of analysis which by noting the relative frequency of its several terms would furnish him with the key to a ciphered message, he would at once have remarked that no expression, not even the commonest forms of speech, occurred in it nearly so often as ""at my cousins the Guermantes's,"" ""at my aunt Guermantes's,"" ""Elzéar de Guermantes's health,"" ""my cousin Guermantes's box."" If anyone spoke to her of a distinguished personage, she would reply that, although she was not personally acquainted with him, she had seen him hundreds of times at her aunt Guermantes's, but she would utter this reply in so icy a tone, with such a hollow sound, that it was at once quite clear that if she did not know the celebrity personally that was because of all the obstinate, ineradicable principles against which her arching shoulders were stretched back to rest, as on one of those ladders on which gymnastic instructors make us 'extend' so as to develop the expansion of our chests

   At this moment the Princesse des Laumes, who had not been expected to appear at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's that evening, did in fact arrive. To shew that she did not wish any special attention, in a house to which she had come by an act of condescension, to be paid to her superior rank, she had entered the room with her arms pressed close to her sides, even when there was no crowd to be squeezed through, no one attempting to get past her; staying purposely at the back, with the air of being in her proper place, like a king who stands in the waiting procession at the doors of a theatre where the management have not been warned of his coming; and strictly limiting her field of vision—so as not to seem to be advertising her presence and claiming the consideration that was her due—to the study of a pattern in the carpet or of her own skirt, she stood there on the spot which had struck her as the most modest (and from which, as she very well knew, a cry of rapture from Mme. de Saint-Euverte would extricate her as soon as her presence there was noticed), next to Mme. de Cambremer, whom, however, she did not know. She observed the dumb-show by which her neighbour was expressing her passion for music, but she refrained from copying it. This was not to say that, for once that she had consented to spend a few minutes in Mme. de Saint-Euverte's house, the Princesse des Laumes would not have wished (so that the act of politeness to her hostess which she had performed by coming might, so to speak, 'count double') to shew herself as friendly and obliging as possible. But she had a natural horror of what she called 'exaggerating,' and always made a point of letting people see that she 'simply must not' indulge in any display of emotion that was not in keeping with the tone of the circle in which she moved, although such displays never failed to make an impression upon her, by virtue of that spirit of imitation, akin to timidity, which is developed in the most self-confident persons, by contact with an unfamiliar environment, even though it be inferior to their own. She began to ask herself whether these gesticulations might not, perhaps, be a necessary concomitant of the piece of music that was being played, a piece which, it might be, was in a different category from all the music that she had ever heard before; and whether to abstain from them was not a sign of her own inability to understand the music, and of discourtesy towards the lady of the house; with the result that, in order to express by a compromise both of her contradictory inclinations in turn, at one moment she would merely straighten her shoulder-straps or feel in her golden hair for the little balls of coral or of pink enamel, frosted with tiny diamonds, which formed its simple but effective ornament, studying, with a cold interest, her impassioned neighbour, while at another she would beat time for a few bars with her fan, but, so as not to forfeit her independence, she would beat a different time from the pianist's. When he had finished the Liszt Intermezzo and had begun a Prelude by Chopin, Mme. de Cambremer turned to Mme. de Franquetot with a tender smile, full of intimate reminiscence, as well as of satisfaction (that of a competent judge) with the performance. She had been taught in her girlhood to fondle and cherish those long-necked, sinuous creatures, the phrases of Chopin, so free, so flexible, so tactile, which begin by seeking their ultimate resting-place somewhere beyond and far wide of the direction in which they started, the point which one might have expected them to reach, phrases which divert themselves in those fantastic bypaths only to return more deliberately—with a more premeditated reaction, with more precision, as on a crystal bowl which, if you strike it, will ring and throb until you cry aloud in anguish—to clutch at one's heart

   Brought up in a provincial household with few friends or visitors, hardly ever invited to a ball, she had fuddled her mind, in the solitude of her old manor-house, over setting the pace, now crawling-slow, now passionate, whirling, breathless, for all those imaginary waltzing couples, gathering them like flowers, leaving the ball-room for a moment to listen, where the wind sighed among the pine-trees, on the shore of the lake, and seeing of a sudden advancing towards her, more different from anything one had ever dreamed of than earthly lovers are, a slender young man, whose voice was resonant and strange and false, in white gloves. But nowadays the old-fashioned beauty of this music seemed to have become a trifle stale. Having forfeited, some years back, the esteem of 'really musical' people, it had lost its distinction and its charm, and even those whose taste was frankly bad had ceased to find in it more than a moderate pleasure to which they hardly liked to confess. Mme. de Cambremer cast a furtive glance behind her. She knew that her young daughter-in-law (full of respect for her new and noble family, except in such matters as related to the intellect, upon which, having 'got as far' as Harmony and the Greek alphabet, she was specially enlightened) despised Chopin, and fell quite ill when she heard him played. But finding herself free from the scrutiny of this Wagnerian, who was sitting, at some distance, in a group of her own contemporaries, Mme. de Cambremer let herself drift upon a stream of exquisite memories and sensations. The Princesse des Laumes was touched also. Though without any natural gift for music, she had received, some fifteen years earlier, the instruction which a music-mistress of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, a woman of genius who had been, towards the end of her life, reduced to penury, had started, at seventy, to give to the daughters and granddaughters of her old pupils. This lady was now dead. But her method, an echo of her charming touch, came to life now and then in the fingers of her pupils, even of those who had been in other respects quite mediocre, had given up music, and hardly ever opened a piano. And so Mme. des Laumes could let her head sway to and fro, fully aware of the cause, with a perfect appreciation of the manner in which the pianist was rendering this Prelude, since she knew it by heart. The closing notes of the phrase that he had begun sounded already on her lips. And she murmured ""How charming it is!"" with a stress on the opening consonants of the adjective, a token of her refinement by which she felt her lips so romantically compressed, like the petals of a beautiful, budding flower, that she instinctively brought her eyes into harmony, illuminating them for a moment with a vague and sentimental gaze. Meanwhile Mme. de Gallardon had arrived at the point of saying to herself how annoying it was that she had so few opportunities of meeting the Princesse des Laumes, for she meant to teach her a lesson by not acknowledging her bow. She did not know that her cousin was in the room. A movement of Mme. Franquetot's head disclosed the Princess. At once Mme. de Gallardon dashed towards her, upsetting all her neighbours; although determined to preserve a distant and glacial manner which should remind everyone present that she had no desire to remain on friendly terms with a person in whose house one might find oneself, any day, cheek by jowl with the Princesse Mathilde, and to whom it was not her duty to make advances since she was not 'of her generation,' she felt bound to modify this air of dignity and reserve by some non-committal remark which would justify her overture and would force the Princess to engage in conversation; and so, when she reached her cousin, Mme. de Gallardon, with a stern countenance and one hand thrust out as though she were trying to 'force' a card, began with: ""How is your husband?"" in the same anxious tone that she would have used if the Prince had been seriously ill. The Princess, breaking into a laugh which was one of her characteristics, and was intended at once to shew the rest of an assembly that she was making fun of some one and also to enhance her own beauty by concentrating her features around her animated lips and sparkling eyes, answered: ""Why; he's never been better in his life!"" And she went on laughing

   Mme. de Gallardon then drew herself up and, chilling her expression still further, perhaps because she was still uneasy about the Prince's health, said to her cousin:

   ""Oriane,"" (at once Mme. des Laumes looked with amused astonishment towards an invisible third, whom she seemed to call to witness that she had never authorised Mme. de Gallardon to use her Christian name) ""I should be so pleased if you would look in, just for a minute, to-morrow evening, to hear a quintet, with the clarinet, by Mozart. I should like to have your opinion of it.""

   She seemed not so much to be issuing an invitation as to be asking favour, and to want the Princess's opinion of the Mozart quintet just though it had been a dish invented by a new cook, whose talent it was most important that an epicure should come to judge

   ""But I know that quintet quite well. I can tell you now—that I adore it.""

   ""You know, my husband isn't at all well; it's his liver. He would like so much to see you,"" Mme. de Gallardon resumed, making it now a corporal work of charity for the Princess to appear at her party

   The Princess never liked to tell people that she would not go to their houses. Every day she would write to express her regret at having been kept away—by the sudden arrival of her husband's mother, by an invitation from his brother, by the Opera, by some excursion to the country—from some party to which she had never for a moment dreamed of going. In this way she gave many people the satisfaction of feeling that she was on intimate terms with them, that she would gladly have come to their houses, and that she had been prevented from doing so only by some princely occurrence which they were flattered to find competing with their own humble entertainment. And then, as she belonged to that witty 'Guermantes set'—in which there survived something of the alert mentality, stripped of all commonplace phrases and conventional sentiments, which dated from Mérimée, and found its final expression in the plays of Meilhac and Halévy—she adapted its formula so as to suit even her social engagements, transposed it into the courtesy which was always struggling to be positive and precise, to approximate itself to the plain truth. She would never develop at any length to a hostess the expression of her anxiety to be present at her party; she found it more pleasant to disclose to her all the various little incidents on which it would depend whether it was or was not possible for her to come

   ""Listen, and I'll explain,"" she began to Mme. de Gallardon. ""To-morrow evening I must go to a friend of mine, who has been pestering me to fix a day for ages. If she takes us to the theatre afterwards, then I can't possibly come to you, much as I should love to; but if we just stay in the house, I know there won't be anyone else there, so I can slip away.""

   ""Tell me, have you seen your friend M. Swann?""

   ""No! my precious Charles! I never knew he was here. Where is he? I must catch his eye.""

   ""It's a funny thing that he should come to old Saint-Euverte's,"" Mme. de Gallardon went on. ""Oh, I know he's very clever,"" meaning by that 'very cunning,' ""but that makes no difference; fancy a Jew here, and she the sister and sister-in-law of two Archbishops.""

   ""I am ashamed to confess that I am not in the least shocked,"" said the Princesse des Laumes

   ""I know he's a converted Jew, and all that, and his parents and grandparents before him. But they do say that the converted ones are worse about their religion than the practising ones, that it's all just a pretence; is that true, d'you think?""

   ""I can throw no light at all on the matter.""

   The pianist, who was 'down' to play two pieces by Chopin, after finishing the Prelude had at once attacked a Polonaise. But once Mme. de Gallardon had informed her cousin that Swann was in the room, Chopin himself might have risen from the grave and played all his works in turn without Mme. des Laumes's paying him the slightest attention. She belonged to that one of the two divisions of the human race in which the untiring curiosity which the other half feels about the people whom it does not know is replaced by an unfailing interest in the people whom it does. As with many women of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, the presence, in any room in which she might find herself, of another member of her set, even although she had nothing in particular to say to him, would occupy her mind to the exclusion of every other consideration. From that moment, in the hope that Swann would catch sight of her, the Princess could do nothing but (like a tame white mouse when a lump of sugar is put down before its nose and then taken away) turn her face, in which were crowded a thousand signs of intimate connivance, none of them with the least relevance to the sentiment underlying Chopin's music, in the direction where Swann was, and, if he moved, divert accordingly the course of her magnetic smile

   ""Oriane, don't be angry with me,"" resumed Mme. de Gallardon, who could never restrain herself from sacrificing her highest social ambitions, and the hope that she might one day emerge into a light that would dazzle the world, to the immediate and secret satisfaction of saying something disagreeable, ""people do say about your M. Swann that he's the sort of man one can't have in the house; is that true?""

   ""Why, you, of all people, ought to know that it's true,"" replied the Princesse des Laumes, ""for you must have asked him a hundred times, and he's never been to your house once.""

   And leaving her cousin mortified afresh, she broke out again into a laugh which scandalised everyone who was trying to listen to the music, but attracted the attention of Mme. de Saint-Euverte, who had stayed, out of politeness, near the piano, and caught sight of the Princess now for the first time. Mme. de Saint-Euverte was all the more delighted to see Mme. des Laumes, as she imagined her to be still at Guermantes, looking after her father-in-law, who was ill

   ""My dear Princess, you here?""

   ""Yes, I tucked myself away in a corner, and I've been hearing such lovely things.""

   ""What, you've been in the room quite a time?""

   ""Oh, yes, quite a long time, which seemed very short; it was only long because I couldn't see you.""

   Mme. de Saint-Euverte offered her own chair to the Princess, who declined it with:

   ""Oh, please, no! Why should you? It doesn't matter in the least where I sit."" And deliberately picking out, so as the better to display the simplicity of a really great lady, a low seat without a back: ""There now, that hassock, that's all I want. It will make me keep my back straight. Oh! Good heavens, I'm making a noise again; they'll be telling you to have me 'chucked out'.""

   Meanwhile, the pianist having doubled his speed, the emotion of the music-lovers was reaching its climax, a servant was handing refreshments about on a salver, and was making the spoons rattle, and, as on every other 'party-night', Mme. de Saint-Euverte was making signs to him, which he never saw, to leave the room. A recent bride, who had been told that a young woman ought never to appear bored, was smiling vigorously, trying to catch her hostess's eye so as to flash a token of her gratitude for the other's having 'thought of her' in connection with so delightful an entertainment. And yet, although she remained more calm than Mme. de Franquetot, it was not without some uneasiness that she followed the flying fingers; what alarmed her being not the pianist's fate but the piano's, on which a lighted candle, jumping at each fortissimo, threatened, if not to set its shade on fire, at least to spill wax upon the ebony. At last she could contain herself no longer, and, running up the two steps of the platform on which the piano stood, flung herself on the candle to adjust its sconce. But scarcely had her hand come within reach of it when, on a final chord, the piece finished, and the pianist rose to his feet. Nevertheless the bold initiative shewn by this young woman and the moment of blushing confusion between her and the pianist which resulted from it, produced an impression that was favourable on the whole

   ""Did you see what that girl did just now, Princess?"" asked General de Froberville, who had come up to Mme. des Laumes as her hostess left her for a moment. ""Odd, wasn't it? Is she one of the performers?""

   ""No, she's a little Mme. de Cambremer,"" replied the Princess carelessly, and then, with more animation: ""I am only repeating what I heard just now, myself; I haven't the faintest notion who said it, it was some one behind me who said that they were neighbours of Mme. de Saint-Euverte in the country, but I don't believe anyone knows them, really. They must be 'country cousins'! By the way, I don't know whether you're particularly 'well-up' in the brilliant society which we see before us, because I've no idea who all these astonishing people can be. What do you suppose they do with themselves when they're not at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's parties? She must have ordered them in with the musicians and the chairs and the food. 'Universal providers,' you know. You must admit, they're rather splendid, General. But can she really have the courage to hire the same 'supers' every week? It isn't possible!""

   ""Oh, but Cambremer is quite a good name; old, too,"" protested the General

   ""I see no objection to its being old,"" the Princess answered dryly, ""but whatever else it is it's not euphonious,"" she went on, isolating the word euphonious as though between inverted commas, a little affectation to which the Guermantes set were addicted

   ""You think not, eh! She's a regular little peach, though,"" said the General, whose eyes never strayed from Mme. de Cambremer. ""Don't you agree with me, Princess?""

   ""She thrusts herself forward too much; I think, in so young a woman, that's not very nice—for I don't suppose she's my generation,"" replied Mme. des Laumes (the last word being common, it appeared, to Gallardon and Guermantes). And then, seeing that M. de Froberville was still gazing at Mme. de Cambremer, she added, half out of malice towards the lady, half wishing to oblige the General: ""Not very nice... for her husband! I am sorry that I do not know her, since she seems to attract you so much; I might have introduced you to her,"" said the Princess, who, if she had known the young woman, would most probably have done nothing of the sort. ""And now I must say good night, because one of my friends is having a birthday party, and I must go and wish her many happy returns,"" she explained, modestly and with truth, reducing the fashionable gathering to which she was going to the simple proportions of a ceremony which would be boring in the extreme, but at which she was obliged to be present, and there would be something touching about her appearance. ""Besides, I must pick up Basin. While I've been here, he's gone to see those friends of his—you know them too, I'm sure,—who are called after a bridge—oh, yes, the Iénas.""

   ""It was a battle before it was a bridge, Princess; it was a victory!"" said the General. ""I mean to say, to an old soldier like me,"" he went on, wiping his monocle and replacing it, as though he were laying a fresh dressing on the raw wound underneath, while the Princess instinctively looked away, ""that Empire nobility, well, of course, it's not the same thing, but, after all, taking it as it is, it's very fine of its kind; they were people who really did fight like heroes.""

   ""But I have the deepest respect for heroes,"" the Princess assented, though with a faint trace of irony. ""If I don't go with Basin to see this Princesse d'Iéna, it isn't for that, at all; it's simply because I don't know them. Basin knows them; he worships them. Oh, no, it's not what you think; he's not in love with her. I've nothing to set my face against! Besides, what good has it ever done when I have set my face against them?"" she queried sadly, for the whole world knew that, ever since the day upon which the Prince des Laumes had married his fascinating cousin, he had been consistently unfaithful to her. ""Anyhow, it isn't that at all. They're people he has known for ever so long, they do him very well, and that suits me down to the ground. But I must tell you what he's told me about their house; it's quite enough. Can you imagine it, all their furniture is 'Empire'!""

   ""But, my dear Princess, that's only natural; it belonged to their grandparents.""

   ""I don't quite say it didn't, but that doesn't make it any less ugly. I quite understand that people can't always have nice things, but at least they needn't have things that are merely grotesque. What do you say? I can think of nothing more devastating, more utterly smug than that hideous style—cabinets covered all over with swans' heads, like bath-taps!""

   ""But I believe, all the same, that they've got some lovely things; why, they must have that famous mosaic table on which the Treaty of...""

   ""Oh, I don't deny, they may have things that are interesting enough from the historic point of view. But things like that can't, ever, be beautiful ... because they're simply horrible! I've got things like that myself, that came to Basin from the Montesquious. Only, they're up in the attics at Guermantes, where nobody ever sees them. But, after all, that's not the point, I would fly to see them, with Basin; I would even go to see them among all their sphinxes and brasses, if I knew them, but—I don't know them! D'you know, I was always taught, when I was a little girl, that it was not polite to call on people one didn't know."" She assumed a tone of childish gravity. ""And so I am just doing what I was taught to do. Can't you see those good people, with a totally strange woman bursting into their house? Why, I might get a most hostile reception.""

   And she coquettishly enhanced the charm of the smile which the idea had brought to her lips, by giving to her blue eyes, which were fixed on the General, a gentle, dreamy expression

   ""My dear Princess, you know that they'd be simply wild with joy.""

   ""No, why?"" she inquired, with the utmost vivacity, either so as to seem unaware that it would be because she was one of the first ladies in France, or so as to have the pleasure of hearing the General tell her so. ""Why? How can you tell? Perhaps they would think it the most unpleasant thing that could possibly happen. I know nothing about them, but if they're anything like me, I find it quite boring enough to see the people I do know; I'm sure if I had to see people I didn't know as well, even if they had 'fought like heroes,' I should go stark mad. Besides, except when it's an old friend like you, whom one knows quite apart from that, I'm not sure that 'heroism' takes one very far in society. It's often quite boring enough to have to give a dinner-party, but if one had to offer one's arm to Spartacus, to let him take one down...! Really, no; it would never be Vercingetorix I should send for, to make a fourteenth. I feel sure, I should keep him for really big 'crushes.' And as I never give any...""

   ""Ah! Princess, it's easy to see you're not a Guermantes for nothing. You have your share of it, all right, the 'wit of the Guermantes'!""

   ""But people always talk about the wit of the Guermantes; I never could make out why. Do you really know any others who have it?"" she rallied him, with a rippling flow of laughter, her features concentrated, yoked to the service of her animation, her eyes sparkling, blazing with a radiant sunshine of gaiety which could be kindled only by such speeches—even if the Princess had to make them herself—as were in praise of h wit or of her beauty. ""Look, there's Swann talking to your Cambremer woman; over there, beside old Saint-Euverte, don't you see him? Ask him to introduce you. But hurry up, he seems to be just going!""

   ""Did you notice how dreadfully ill he's looking?"" asked the General

   ""My precious Charles? Ah, he's coming at last; I was beginning to think he didn't want to see me!""

   Swann was extremely fond of the Princesse des Laumes, and the sight of her recalled to him Guermantes, a property close to Combray, and all that country which he so dearly loved and had ceased to visit, so as not to be separated from Odette. Slipping into the manner, half-artistic, half-amorous—with which he could always manage to amuse the Princess—a manner which came to him quite naturally whenever he dipped for a moment into the old social atmosphere, and wishing also to express in words, for his own satisfaction, the longing that he felt for the country:

   ""Ah!"" he exclaimed, or rather intoned, in such a way as to be audible at once to Mme. de Saint-Euverte, to whom he spoke, and to Mme. des Laumes, for whom he was speaking, ""Behold our charming Princess! See, she has come up on purpose from Guermantes to hear Saint Francis preach to the birds, and has only just had time, like a dear little tit-mouse, to go and pick a few little hips and haws and put them in her hair; there are even some drops of dew upon them still, a little of the hoar-frost which must be making the Duchess, down there, shiver. It is very pretty indeed, my dear Princess.""

   ""What! The Princess came up on purpose from Guermantes? But that's too wonderful! I never knew; I'm quite bewildered,"" Mme. de Saint-Euverte protested with quaint simplicity, being but little accustomed to Swann's way of speaking. And then, examining the Princess's headdress, ""Why, you're quite right; it is copied from... what shall I say, not chestnuts, no,—oh, it's a delightful idea, but how can the Princess have known what was going to be on my programme? The musicians didn't tell me, even.""

   Swann, who was accustomed, when he was with a woman whom he had kept up the habit of addressing in terms of gallantry, to pay her delicate compliments which most other people would not and need not understand, did not condescend to explain to Mme. de Saint-Euverte that he had been speaking metaphorically. As for the Princess, she was in fits of laughter, both because Swann's wit was highly appreciated by her set, and because she could never hear a compliment addressed to herself without finding it exquisitely subtle and irresistibly amusing

   ""Indeed! I'm delighted, Charles, if my little hips and haws meet with your approval. But tell me, why did you bow to that Cambremer person, are you also her neighbour in the country?""

   Mme. de Saint-Euverte, seeing that the Princess seemed quite happy talking to Swann, had drifted away

   ""But you are, yourself, Princess!""

   ""I! Why, they must have 'countries' everywhere, those creatures! Don't I wish I had!""

   ""No, not the Cambremers; her own people. She was a Legrandin, and used to come to Combray. I don't know whether you are aware that you are Comtesse de Combray, and that the Chapter owes you a due.""

   ""I don't know what the Chapter owes me, but I do know that I'm 'touched' for a hundred francs, every year, by the Curé, which is a due that I could very well do without. But surely these Cambremers have rather a startling name. It ends just in time, but it ends badly!"" she said with a laugh

   ""It begins no better."" Swann took the point

   ""Yes; that double abbreviation!""

   ""Some one very angry and very proper who didn't dare to finish the first word.""

   ""But since he couldn't stop himself beginning the second, he'd have done better to finish the first and be done with it. We are indulging in the most refined form of humour, my dear Charles, in the very best of taste—but how tiresome it is that I never see you now,"" she went on in a coaxing tone, ""I do so love talking to you. Just imagine, I could not make that idiot Froberville see that there was anything funny about the name Cambremer. Do agree that life is a dreadful business. It's only when I see you that I stop feeling bored.""

   Which was probably not true. But Swann and the Princess had the same way of looking at the little things of life—the effect, if not the cause of which was a close analogy between their modes of expression and even of pronunciation. This similarity was not striking because no two things could have been more unlike than their voices. But if one took the trouble to imagine Swann's utterances divested of the sonority that enwrapped them, of the moustache from under which they emerged, one found that they were the same phrases, the same inflexions, that they had the 'tone' of the Guermantes set. On important matters, Swann and the Princess had not an idea in common. But since Swann had become so melancholy, and was always in that trembling condition which precedes a flood of tears, he had the same need to speak about his grief that a murderer has to tell some one about his crime. And when he heard the Princess say that life was a dreadful business, he felt as much comforted as if she had spoken to him of Odette

   ""Yes, life is a dreadful business! We must meet more often, my dear friend. What is so nice about you is that you are not cheerful. We could spend a most pleasant evening together.""

   ""I'm sure we could; why not come down to Guermantes? My mother-in-law would be wild with joy. It's supposed to be very ugly down there, but I must say, I find the neighborhood not at all unattractive; I have a horror of 'picturesque spots'.""

   ""I know it well, it's delightful!"" replied Swann. ""It's almost too beautiful, too much alive for me just at present; it's a country to be happy in. It's perhaps because I have lived there, but things there speak to me so. As soon as a breath of wind gets up, and the cornfields begin to stir, I feel that some one is going to appear suddenly, that I am going to hear some news; and those little houses by the water's edge... I should be quite wretched!""

   ""Oh! my dearest Charles, do take care; there's that appalling Rampillon woman; she's seen me; hide me somewhere, do tell me again, quickly, what it was that happened to her; I get so mixed up; she's just married off her daughter, or her lover (I never can remember),—perhaps both—to each other! Oh, no, I remember now, she's been dropped by her Prince... Pretend to be talking, so that the poor old Berenice sha'n't come and invite me to dinner. Anyhow, I'm going. Listen, my dearest Charles, now that I have seen you, once in a blue moon, won't you let me carry you off and take you to the Princesse de Parme's, who would be so pleased to see you (you know), and Basin too, for that matter; he's meeting me there. If one didn't get news of you, sometimes, from Mémé... Remember, I never see you at all now!""

   Swann declined. Having told M. de Charlus that, on leaving Mme. de Saint-Euverte's, he would go straight home, he did not care to run the risk, by going on now to the Princesse de Parme's, of missing a message which he had, all the time, been hoping to see brought in to him by one of the footmen, during the party, and which he was perhaps going to find left with his own porter, at home

   ""Poor Swann,"" said Mme. des Laumes that night to her husband; ""he is always charming, but he does look so dreadfully unhappy. You will see for yourself, for he has promised to dine with us one of these days. I do feel that it's really absurd that a man of his intelligence should let himself be made to suffer by a creature of that kind, who isn't even interesting, for they tell me, she's an absolute idiot!"" she concluded with the wisdom invariably shewn by people who, not being in love themselves, feel that a clever man ought to be unhappy only about such persons as are worth his while; which is rather like being astonished that anyone should condescend to die of cholera at the bidding of so insignificant a creature as the common bacillus

   Swann now wished to go home, but, just as he was making his escape, General de Froberville caught him and asked for an introduction to Mme. de Cambremer, and he was obliged to go back into the room to look for her

   ""I say, Swann, I'd rather be married to that little woman than killed by savages, what do you say?""

   The words 'killed by savages' pierced Swann's aching heart; and at once he felt the need of continuing the conversation. ""Ah!"" he began, ""some fine lives have been lost in that way... There was, you remember, that explorer whose remains Dumont d'Urville brought back, La Pérouse..."" (and he was at once happy again, as though he had named Odette). ""He was a fine character, and interests me very much, does La Pérouse,"" he ended sadly

   ""Oh, yes, of course, La Pérouse,"" said the General. ""It's quite a well-known name. There's a street called that.""

   ""Do you know anyone in the Rue La Pérouse?"" asked Swann excitedly

   ""Only Mme. de Chanlivault, the sister of that good fellow Chaussepierre. She gave a most amusing theatre-party the other evening. That's a house that will be really smart some day, you'll see!""

   ""Oh, so she lives in the Rue La Pérouse. It's attractive; I like that street; it's so sombre.""

   ""Indeed it isn't. You can't have been in it for a long time; it's not at all sombre now; they're beginning to build all round there.""

   When Swann did finally introduce M. de Froberville to the young Mme. de Cambremer, since it was the first time that she had heard the General's name, she hastily outlined upon her lips the smile of joy and surprise with which she would have greeted him if she had never, in the whole of her life, heard anything else; for, as she did not yet know all the friends of her new family, whenever anyone was presented to her, she assumed that he must be one of them, and thinking that she would shew her tact by appearing to have heard 'such a lot about him' since her marriage, she would hold out her hand with an air of hesitation which was meant as a proof at once of the inculcated reserve which she had to overcome and of the spontaneous friendliness which successfully overcame it. And so her parents-in-law, whom she still regarded as the most eminent pair in France, declared that she was an angel; all the more that they preferred to appear, in marrying her to their son, to have yielded to the attraction rather of her natural charm than of her considerable fortune

   ""It's easy to see that you're a musician heart and soul, Madame,"" said the General, alluding to the incident of the candle

   Meanwhile the concert had begun again, and Swann saw that he could not now go before the end of the new number. He suffered greatly from being shut up among all these people whose stupidity and absurdities wounded him all the more cruelly since, being ignorant of his love, incapable, had they known of it, of taking any interest, or of doing more than smile at it as at some childish joke, or deplore it as an act of insanity, they made it appear to him in the aspect of a subjective state which existed for himself alone, whose reality there was nothing external to confirm; he suffered overwhelmingly, to the point at which even the sound of the instruments made him want to cry, from having to prolong his exile in this place to which Odette would never come, in which no one, nothing was aware of her existence, from which she was entirely absent

   But suddenly it was as though she had entered, and this apparition tore him with such anguish that his hand rose impulsively to his heart. What had happened was that the violin had risen to a series of high notes, on which it rested as though expecting something, an expectancy which it prolonged without ceasing to hold on to the notes, in the exaltation with which it already saw the expected object approaching, and with a desperate effort to continue until its arrival, to welcome it before itself expired, to keep the way open for a moment longer, with all its remaining strength, that the stranger might enter in, as one holds a door open that would otherwise automatically close. And before Swann had had time to understand what was happening, to think: ""It is the little phrase from Vinteuil's sonata. I mustn't listen!"", all his memories of the days when Odette had been in love with him, which he had succeeded, up till that evening, in keeping invisible in the depths of his being, deceived by this sudden reflection of a season of love, whose sun, they supposed, had dawned again, had awakened from their slumber, had taken wing and risen to sing maddeningly in his ears, without pity for his present desolation, the forgotten strains of happiness

   In place of the abstract expressions ""the time when I was happy,"" ""the time when I was loved,"" which he had often used until then, and without much suffering, for his intelligence had not embodied in them anything of the past save fictitious extracts which preserved none of the reality, he now recovered everything that had fixed unalterably the peculiar, volatile essence of that lost happiness; he could see it all; the snowy, curled petals of the chrysanthemum which she had tossed after him into his carriage, which he had kept pressed to his lips, the address 'Maison Dorée,' embossed on the note-paper on which he had read ""My hand trembles so as I write to you,"" the frowning contraction of her eyebrows when she said pleadingly: ""You won't let it be very long before you send for me?""; he could smell the heated iron of the barber whom he used to have in to singe his hair while Loredan went to fetch the little working girl; could feel the torrents of rain which fell so often that spring, the ice-cold homeward drive in his victoria, by moonlight; all the network of mental habits, of seasonable impressions, of sensory reactions, which had extended over a series of weeks its uniform meshes, by which his body now found itself inextricably held. At that time he had been satisfying a sensual curiosity to know what were the pleasures of those people who lived for love alone. He had supposed that he could stop there, that he would not be obliged to learn their sorrows also; how small a thing the actual charm of Odette was now in comparison with that formidable terror which extended it like a cloudy halo all around her, that enormous anguish of not knowing at every hour of the day and night what she had been doing, of not possessing her wholly, at all times and in all places! Alas, he recalled the accents in which she had exclaimed: ""But I can see you at any time; I am always free!""—she, who was never free now; the interest, the curiosity that she had shewn in his life, her passionate desire that he should do her the favour—of which it was he who, then, had felt suspicious, as of a possibly tedious waste of his time and disturbance of his arrangements—of granting her access to his study; how she had been obliged to beg that he would let her take him to the Verdurins'; and, when he did allow her to come to him once a month, how she had first, before he would let himself be swayed, had to repeat what a joy it would be to her, that custom of their seeing each other daily, for which she had longed at a time when to him it had seemed only a tiresome distraction, for which, since that time, she had conceived a distaste and had definitely broken herself of it, while it had become for him so insatiable, so dolorous a need. Little had he suspected how truly he spoke when, on their third meeting, as she repeated: ""But why don't you let me come to you oftener?"" he had told her, laughing, and in a vein of gallantry, that it was for fear of forming a hopeless passion. Now, alas, it still happened at times that she wrote to him from a restaurant or hotel, on paper which bore a printed address, but printed in letters of fire that seared his heart. ""Written from the Hôtel Vouillemont. What on earth can she have gone there for? With whom? What happened there?"" He remembered the gas-jets that were being extinguished along the Boulevard des Italiens when he had met her, when all hope was gone among the errant shades upon that night which had seemed to him almost supernatural and which now (that night of a period when he had not even to ask himself whether he would be annoying her by looking for her and by finding her, so certain was he that she knew no greater happiness than to see him and to let him take her home) belonged indeed to a mysterious world to which one never may return again once its doors are closed. And Swann could distinguish, standing, motionless, before that scene of happiness in which it lived again, a wretched figure which filled him with such pity, because he did not at first recognise who it was, that he must lower his head, lest anyone should observe that his eyes were filled with tears. It was himself

   When he had realised this, his pity ceased; he was jealous, now, of that other self whom she had loved, he was jealous of those men of whom he had so often said, without much suffering: ""Perhaps she's in love with them,"" now that he had exchanged the vague idea of loving, in which there is no love, for the petals of the chrysanthemum and the 'letter-heading' of the Maison d'Or; for they were full of love. And then, his anguish becoming too keen, he passed his hand over his forehead, let the monocle drop from his eye, and wiped its glass. And doubtless, if he had caught sight of himself at that moment, he would have added to the collection of the monocles which he had already identified, this one which he removed, like an importunate, worrying thought, from his head, while from its misty surface, with his handkerchief, he sought to obliterate his cares

   There are in the music of the violin—if one does not see the instrument itself, and so cannot relate what one hears to its form, which modifies the fullness of the sound—accents which are so closely akin to those of certain contralto voices, that one has the illusion that a singer has taken her place amid the orchestra. One raises one's eyes; one sees only the wooden case, magical as a Chinese box; but, at moments, one is still tricked by the deceiving appeal of the Siren; at times, too, one believes that one is listening to a captive spirit, struggling in the darkness of its masterful box, a box quivering with enchantment, like a devil immersed in a stoup of holy water; sometimes, again, it is in the air, at large, like a pure and supernatural creature that reveals to the ear, as it passes, its invisible message

   As though the musicians were not nearly so much playing the little phrase as performing the rites on which it insisted before it would consent to appear, as proceeding to utter the incantations necessary to procure, and to prolong for a few moments, the miracle of its apparition, Swann, who was no more able now to see it than if it had belonged to a world of ultra-violet light, who experienced something like the refreshing sense of a metamorphosis in the momentary blindness with which he had been struck as he approached it, Swann felt that it was present, like a protective goddess, a confidant of his love, who, so as to be able to come to him through the crowd, and to draw him aside to speak to him, had disguised herself in this sweeping cloak of sound. And as she passed him, light, soothing, as softly murmured as the perfume of a flower, telling him what she had to say, every word of which he closely scanned, sorry to see them fly away so fast, he made involuntarily with his lips the motion of kissing, as it went by him, the harmonious, fleeting form

   He felt that he was no longer in exile and alone since she, who addressed herself to him, spoke to him in a whisper of Odette. For he had no longer, as of old, the impression that Odette and he were not known to the little phrase. Had it not often been the witness of their joys? True that, as often, it had warned him of their frailty. And indeed, whereas, in that distant time, he had divined an element of suffering in its smile, in its limpid and disillusioned intonation, to-night he found there rather the charm of a resignation that was almost gay. Of those sorrows, of which the little phrase had spoken to him then, which he had seen it—without his being touched by them himself—carry past him, smiling, on its sinuous and rapid course, of those sorrows which were now become his own, without his having any hope of being, ever, delivered from them, it seemed to say to him, as once it had said of his happiness: ""What does all that matter; it is all nothing."" And Swann's thoughts were borne for the first time on a wave of pity and tenderness towards that Vinteuil, towards that unknown, exalted brother who also must have suffered so greatly; what could his life have been? From the depths of what well of sorrow could he have drawn that god-like strength, that unlimited power of creation?

   When it was the little phrase that spoke to him of the vanity of his sufferings, Swann found a sweetness in that very wisdom which, but a little while back, had seemed to him intolerable when he thought that he could read it on the faces of indifferent strangers, who would regard his love as a digression that was without importance. 'Twas because the little phrase, unlike them, whatever opinion it might hold on the short duration of these states of the soul, saw in them something not, as everyone else saw, less serious than the events of everyday life, but, on the contrary, so far superior to everyday life as to be alone worthy of the trouble of expressing it. Those graces of an intimate sorrow, 'twas them that the phrase endeavoured to imitate, to create anew; and even their essence, for all that it consists in being incommunicable and in appearing trivial to everyone save him who has experience of them, the little phrase had captured, had rendered visible. So much so that it made their value be confessed, their divine sweetness be tasted by all those same onlookers—provided only that they were in any sense musical—who, the next moment, would ignore, would disown them in real life, in every individual love that came into being beneath their eyes. Doubtless the form in which it had codified those graces could not be analysed into any logical elements. But ever since, more than a year before, discovering to him many of the riches of his own soul, the love of music had been born, and for a time at least had dwelt in him, Swann had regarded musical motifs as actual ideas, of another world, of another order, ideas veiled in shadows, unknown, impenetrable by the human mind, which none the less were perfectly distinct one from another, unequal among themselves in value and in significance. When, after that first evening at the Verdurins', he had had the little phrase played over to him again, and had sought to disentangle from his confused impressions how it was that, like a perfume or a caress, it swept over and enveloped him, he had observed that it was to the closeness of the intervals between the five notes which composed it and to the constant repetition of two of them that was due that impression of a frigid, a contracted sweetness; but in reality he knew that he was basing this conclusion not upon the phrase itself, but merely upon certain equivalents, substituted (for his mind's convenience) for the mysterious entity of which he had become aware, before ever he knew the Verdurins, at that earlier party, when for the first time he had heard the sonata played. He knew that his memory of the piano falsified still further the perspective in which he saw the music, that the field open to the musician is not a miserable stave of seven notes, but an immeasurable keyboard (still, almost all of it, unknown), on which, here and there only, separated by the gross darkness of its unexplored tracts, some few among the millions of keys, keys of tenderness, of passion, of courage, of serenity, which compose it, each one differing from all the rest as one universe differs from another, have been discovered by certain great artists who do us the service, when they awaken in us the emotion corresponding to the theme which they have found, of shewing us what richness, what variety lies hidden, unknown to us, in that great black impenetrable night, discouraging exploration, of our soul, which we have been content to regard as valueless and waste and void. Vinteuil had been one of those musicians. In his little phrase, albeit it presented to the mind's eye a clouded surface, there was contained, one felt, a matter so consistent, so explicit, to which the phrase gave so new, so original a force, that those who had once heard it preserved the memory of it in the treasure-chamber of their minds. Swann would repair to it as to a conception of love and happiness, of which at once he knew as well in what respects it was peculiar as he would know of the Princesse de Clèves, or of René, should either of those titles occur to him. Even when he was not thinking of the little phrase, it existed, latent, in his mind, in the same way as certain other conceptions without material equivalent, such as our notions of light, of sound, of perspective, of bodily desire, the rich possessions wherewith our inner temple is diversified and adorned. Perhaps we shall lose them, perhaps they will be obliterated, if we return to nothing in the dust. But so long as we are alive, we can no more bring ourselves to a state in which we shall not have known them than we can with regard to any material object, than we can, for example, doubt the luminosity of a lamp that has just been lighted, in view of the changed aspect of everything in the room, from which has vanished even the memory of the darkness. In that way Vinteuil's phrase, like some theme, say, in Tristan, which represents to us also a certain acquisition of sentiment, has espoused our mortal state, had endued a vesture of humanity that was affecting enough. Its destiny was linked, for the future, with that of the human soul, of which it was one of the special, the most distinctive ornaments. Perhaps it is not-being that is the true state, and all our dream of life is without existence; but, if so, we feel that it must be that these phrases of music, these conceptions which exist in relation to our dream, are nothing either. We shall perish, but we have for our hostages these divine captives who shall follow and share our fate. And death in their company is something less bitter, less inglorious, perhaps even less certain

   So Swann was not mistaken in believing that the phrase of the sonata did, really, exist. Human as it was from this point of view, it belonged, none the less, to an order of supernatural creatures whom we have never seen, but whom, in spite of that, we recognise and acclaim with rapture when some explorer of the unseen contrives to coax one forth, to bring it down from that divine world to which he has access to shine for a brief moment in the firmament of ours. This was what Vinteuil had done for the little phrase. Swann felt that the composer had been content (with the musical instruments at his disposal) to draw aside its veil, to make it visible, following and respecting its outlines with a hand so loving, so prudent, so delicate and so sure, that the sound altered at every moment, blunting itself to indicate a shadow, springing back into life when it must follow the curve of some more bold projection. And one proof that Swann was not mistaken when he believed in the real existence of this phrase, was that anyone with an ear at all delicate for music would at once have detected the imposture had Vinteuil, endowed with less power to see and to render its forms, sought to dissemble (by adding a line, here and there, of his own invention) the dimness of his vision or the feebleness of his hand

   The phrase had disappeared. Swann knew that it would come again at the end of the last movement, after a long passage which Mme. Verdurin's pianist always 'skipped.' There were in this passage some admirable ideas which Swann had not distinguished on first hearing the sonata, and which he now perceived, as if they had, in the cloakroom of his memory, divested themselves of their uniform disguise of novelty. Swann listened to all the scattered themes which entered into the composition of the phrase, as its premises enter into the inevitable conclusion of a syllogism; he was assisting at the mystery of its birth. ""Audacity,"" he exclaimed to himself, ""as inspired, perhaps, as a Lavoisier's or an Ampere's, the audacity of a Vinteuil making experiment, discovering the secret laws that govern an unknown force, driving across a region unexplored towards the one possible goal the invisible team in which he has placed his trust and which he never may discern!"" How charming the dialogue which Swann now heard between piano and violin, at the beginning of the last passage. The suppression of human speech, so far from letting fancy reign there uncontrolled (as one might have thought), had eliminated it altogether. Never was spoken language of such inflexible necessity, never had it known questions so pertinent, such obvious replies. At first the piano complained alone, like a bird deserted by its mate; the violin heard and answered it, as from a neighbouring tree. It was as at the first beginning of the world, as if there were not yet but these twain upon the earth, or rather in this world closed against all the rest, so fashioned by the logic of its creator that in it there should never be any but themselves; the world of this sonata. Was it a bird, was it the soul, not yet made perfect, of the little phrase, was it a fairy, invisibly somewhere lamenting, whose plaint the piano heard and tenderly repeated? Its cries were so sudden that the violinist must snatch up his bow and race to catch them as they came. Marvellous bird! The violinist seemed to wish to charm, to tame, to woo, to win it. Already it had passed into his soul, already the little phrase which it evoked shook like a medium's the body of the violinist, 'possessed' indeed. Swann knew that the phrase was going to speak to him once again. And his personality was now so divided that the strain of waiting for the imminent moment when he would find himself face to face, once more, with the phrase, convulsed him in one of those sobs which a fine line of poetry or a piece of alarming news will wring from us, not when we are alone, but when we repeat one or the other to a friend, in whom we see ourselves reflected, like a third person, whose probable emotion softens him. It reappeared, but this time to remain poised in the air, and to sport there for a moment only, as though immobile, and shortly to expire. And so Swann lost nothing of the precious time for which it lingered. It was still there, like an iridescent bubble that floats for a while unbroken. As a rainbow, when its brightness fades, seems to subside, then soars again and, before it is extinguished, is glorified with greater splendour than it has ever shewn; so to the two colours which the phrase had hitherto allowed to appear it added others now, chords shot with every hue in the prism, and made them sing. Swann dared not move, and would have liked to compel all the other people in the room to remain still also, as if the slightest movement might embarrass the magic presence, supernatural, delicious, frail, that would so easily vanish. But no one, as it happened, dreamed of speaking. The ineffable utterance of one solitary man, absent, perhaps dead (Swann did not know whether Vinteuil were still alive), breathed out above the rites of those two hierophants, sufficed to arrest the attention of three hundred minds, and made of that stage on which a soul was thus called into being one of the noblest altars on which a supernatural ceremony could be performed. It followed that, when the phrase at last was finished, and only its fragmentary echoes floated among the subsequent themes which had already taken its place, if Swann at first was annoyed to see the Comtesse de Monteriender, famed for her imbecilities, lean over towards him to confide in him her impressions, before even the sonata had come to an end; he could not refrain from smiling, and perhaps also found an underlying sense, which she was incapable of perceiving, in the words that she used. Dazzled by the virtuosity of the performers, the Comtesse exclaimed to Swann: ""It's astonishing! I have never seen anything to beat it..."" But a scrupulous regard for accuracy making her correct her first assertion, she added the reservation: ""anything to beat it... since the table-turning!""

   From that evening, Swann understood that the feeling which Odette had once had for him would never revive, that his hopes of happiness would not be realised now. And the days on which, by a lucky chance, she had once more shewn herself kind and loving to him, or if she had paid him any attention, he recorded those apparent and misleading signs of a slight movement on her part towards him with the same tender and sceptical solicitude, the desperate joy that people reveal who, when they are nursing a friend in the last days of an incurable malady, relate, as significant facts of infinite value: ""Yesterday he went through his accounts himself, and actually corrected a mistake that we had made in adding them up; he ate an egg to-day and seemed quite to enjoy it, if he digests it properly we shall try him with a cutlet to-morrow,""—although they themselves know that these things are meaningless on the eve of an inevitable death. No doubt Swann was assured that if he had now been living at a distance from Odette he would gradually have lost all interest in her, so that he would have been glad to learn that she was leaving Paris for ever; he would have had the courage to remain there; but he had not the courage to go

   He had often thought of going. Now that he was once again at work upon his essay on Vermeer, he wanted to return, for a few days at least, to The Hague, to Dresden, to Brunswick. He was certain that a 'Toilet of Diana' which had been acquired by the Mauritshuis at the Goldschmidt sale as a Nicholas Maes was in reality a Vermeer. And he would have liked to be able to examine the picture on the spot, so as to strengthen his conviction. But to leave Paris while Odette was there, and even when she was not there—for in strange places where our sensations have not been numbed by habit, we refresh, we revive an old pain—was for him so cruel a project that he felt himself to be capable of entertaining it incessantly in his mind only because he knew himself to be resolute in his determination never to put it into effect. But it would happen that, while he was asleep, the intention to travel would reawaken in him (without his remembering that this particular tour was impossible) and would be realised. One night he dreamed that he was going away for a year; leaning from the window of the train towards a young man on the platform who wept as he bade him farewell, he was seeking to persuade this young man to come away also. The train began to move; he awoke in alarm, and remembered that he was not going away, that he would see Odette that evening, and next day and almost every day. And then, being still deeply moved by his dream, he would thank heaven for those special circumstances which made him independent, thanks to which he could remain in Odette's vicinity, and could even succeed in making her allow him to see her sometimes; and, counting over the list of his advantages: his social position—his fortune, from which she stood too often in need of assistance not to shrink from the prospect of a definite rupture (having even, so people said, an ulterior plan of getting him to marry her)—his friendship with M. de Charlus, which, it must be confessed, had never won him any very great favour from Odette, but which gave him the pleasant feeling that she was always hearing complimentary things said about him by this common friend for whom she had so great an esteem—and even his own intelligence, the whole of which he employed in weaving, every day, a fresh plot which would make his presence, if not agreeable, at any rate necessary to Odette—he thought of what might have happened to him if all these advantages had been lacking, he thought that, if he had been, like so many other men, poor and humble, without resources, forced to undertake any task that might be offered to him, or tied down by parents or by a wife, he might have been obliged to part from Odette, that that dream, the terror of which was still so recent, might well have been true; and he said to himself: ""People don't know when they are happy. They're never so unhappy as they think they are."" But he reflected that this existence had lasted already for several years, that all that he could now hope for was that it should last for ever, that he would sacrifice his work, his pleasures, his friends, in fact the whole of his life to the daily expectation of a meeting which, when it occurred, would bring him no happiness; and he asked himself whether he was not mistaken, whether the circumstances that had favoured their relations and had prevented a final rupture had not done a disservice to his career, whether the outcome to be desired was not that as to which he rejoiced that it happened only in dreams—his own departure; and he said to himself that people did not know when they were unhappy, that they were never so happy as they supposed

   Sometimes he hoped that she would die, painlessly, in some accident, she who was out of doors in the streets, crossing busy thoroughfares, from morning to night. And as she always returned safe and sound, he marvelled at the strength, at the suppleness of the human body, which was able continually to hold in check, to outwit all the perils that environed it (which to Swann seemed innumerable, since his own secret desire had strewn them in her path), and so allowed its occupant, the soul, to abandon itself, day after day, and almost with impunity, to its career of mendacity, to the pursuit of pleasure. And Swann felt a very cordial sympathy with that Mahomet II whose portrait by Bellini he admired, who, on finding that he had fallen madly in love with one of his wives, stabbed her, in order, as his Venetian biographer artlessly relates, to recover his spiritual freedom. Then he would be ashamed of thinking thus only of himself, and his own sufferings would seem to deserve no pity now that he himself was disposing so cheaply of Odette's very life

   Since he was unable to separate himself from her without a subsequent return, if at least he had seen her continuously and without separations his grief would ultimately have been assuaged, and his love would, perhaps, have died. And from the moment when she did not wish to leave Paris for ever he had hoped that she would never go. As he knew that her one prolonged absence, every year, was in August and September, he had abundant opportunity, several months in advance, to dissociate from it the grim picture of her absence throughout Eternity which was lodged in him by anticipation, and which, consisting of days closely akin to the days through which he was then passing, floated in a cold transparency in his mind, which it saddened and depressed, though without causing him any intolerable pain. But that conception of the future, that flowing stream, colourless and unconfined, a single word from Odette sufficed to penetrate through all Swann's defences, and like a block of ice immobilised it, congealed its fluidity, made it freeze altogether; and Swann felt himself suddenly filled with an enormous and unbreakable mass which pressed on the inner walls of his consciousness until he was fain to burst asunder; for Odette had said casually, watching him with a malicious smile: ""Forcheville is going for a fine trip at Whitsuntide. He's going to Egypt!"" and Swann had at once understood that this meant: ""I am going to Egypt at Whitsuntide with Forcheville."" And, in fact, if, a few days later, Swann began: ""About that trip that you told me you were going to take with Forcheville,"" she would answer carelessly: ""Yes, my dear boy, we're starting on the 19th; we'll send you a 'view' of the Pyramids."" Then he was determined to know whether she was Forcheville's mistress, to ask her point-blank, to insist upon her telling him. He knew that there were some perjuries which, being so superstitious, she would not commit, and besides, the fear, which had hitherto restrained his curiosity, of making Odette angry if he questioned her, of making himself odious, had ceased to exist now that he had lost all hope of ever being loved by her

   One day he received an anonymous letter which told him that Odette had been the mistress of countless men (several of whom it named, among them Forcheville, M. de Bréauté and the painter) and women, and that she frequented houses of ill-fame. He was tormented by the discovery that there was to be numbered among his friends a creature capable of sending him such a letter (for certain details betrayed in the writer a familiarity with his private life). He wondered who it could be. But he had never had any suspicion with regard to the unknown actions of other people, those which had no visible connection with what they said. And when he wanted to know whether it was rather beneath the apparent character of M. de Charlus, or of M. des Laumes, or of M. d'Orsan that he must place the untravelled region in which this ignoble action might have had its birth; as none of these men had ever, in conversation with Swann, suggested that he approved of anonymous letters, and as everything that they had ever said to him implied that they strongly disapproved, he saw no further reason for associating this infamy with the character of any one of them more than with the rest. M. de Charlus was somewhat inclined to eccentricity, but he was fundamentally good and kind; M. des Laumes was a trifle dry, but wholesome and straight. As for M. d'Orsan, Swann had never met anyone who, even in the most depressing circumstances, would come to him with a more heartfelt utterance, would act more properly or with more discretion. So much so that he was unable to understand the rather indelicate part commonly attributed to M. d'Orsan in his relations with a certain wealthy woman, and that whenever he thought of him he was obliged to set that evil reputation on one side, as irreconcilable with so many unmistakable proofs of his genuine sincerity and refinement. For a moment Swann felt that his mind was becoming clouded, and he thought of something else so as to recover a little light; until he had the courage to return to those other reflections. But then, after not having been able to suspect anyone, he was forced to suspect everyone that he knew. After all, M. de Charlus might be most fond of him, might be most good-natured; but he was a neuropath; to-morrow, perhaps, he would burst into tears on hearing that Swann was ill; and to-day, from jealousy, or in anger, or carried away by some sudden idea, he might have wished to do him a deliberate injury. Really, that kind of man was the worst of all. The Prince des Laumes was, certainly, far less devoted to Swann than was M. de Charlus. But for that very reason he had not the same susceptibility with regard to him; and besides, his was a nature which, though, no doubt, it was cold, was as incapable of a base as of a magnanimous action. Swann regretted that he had formed no attachments in his life except to such people. Then he reflected that what prevents men from doing harm to their neighbours is fellow-feeling, that he could not, in the last resort, answer for any but men whose natures were analogous to his own, as was, so far as the heart went, that of M. de Charlus. The mere thought of causing Swann so much distress would have been revolting to him. But with a man who was insensible, of another order of humanity, as was the Prince des Laumes, how was one to foresee the actions to which he might be led by the promptings of a different nature? To have a good heart was everything, and M. de Charlus had one. But M. d'Orsan was not lacking in that either, and his relations with Swann—cordial, but scarcely intimate, arising from the pleasure which, as they held the same views about everything, they found in talking together—were more quiescent than the enthusiastic affection of M. de Charlus, who was apt to be led into passionate activity, good or evil. If there was anyone by whom Swann felt that he had always been understood, and (with delicacy) loved, it was M. d'Orsan. Yes, but the life he led; it could hardly be called honourable. Swann regretted that he had never taken any notice of those rumours, that he himself had admitted, jestingly, that he had never felt so keen a sense of sympathy, or of respect, as when he was in thoroughly 'detrimental' society. ""It is not for nothing,"" he now assured himself, ""that when people pass judgment upon their neighbour, their finding is based upon his actions. It is those alone that are significant, and not at all what we say or what we think. Charlus and des Laumes may have this or that fault, but they are men of honour. Orsan, perhaps, has not the same faults, but he is not a man of honour. He may have acted dishonourably once again."" Then he suspected Rémi, who, it was true, could only have inspired the letter, but he now felt himself, for a moment, to be on the right track. To begin with, Loredan had his own reasons for wishing harm to Odette. And then, how were we not to suppose that our servants, living in a situation inferior to our own, adding to our fortunes and to our frailties imaginary riches and vices for which they at once envied and despised us, should not find themselves led by fate to act in a manner abhorrent to people of our own class? He also suspected my grandfather. On every occasion when Swann had asked him to do him any service, had he not invariably declined? Besides, with his ideas of middle-class respectability, he might have thought that he was acting for Swann's good. He suspected, in turn, Bergotte, the painter, the Verdurins; paused for a moment to admire once again the wisdom of people in society, who refused to mix in the artistic circles in which such things were possible, were, perhaps, even openly avowed, as excellent jokes; but then he recalled the marks of honesty that were to be observed in those Bohemians, and contrasted them with the life of expedients, often bordering on fraudulence, to which the want of money, the craving for luxury, the corrupting influence of their pleasures often drove members of the aristocracy. In a word, this anonymous letter proved that he himself knew a human being capable of the most infamous conduct, but he could see no reason why that infamy should lurk in the depths—which no strange eye might explore—of the warm heart rather than the cold, the artist's rather than the business-man's, the noble's rather than the flunkey's. What criterion ought one to adopt, in order to judge one's fellows? After all, there was not a single one of the people whom he knew who might not, in certain circumstances, prove capable of a shameful action. Must he then cease to see them all? His mind grew clouded; he passed his hands two or three times across his brow, wiped his glasses with his handkerchief, and remembering that, after all, men who were as good as himself frequented the society of M. de Charlus, the Prince des Laumes and the rest, he persuaded himself that this meant, if not that they were incapable of shameful actions, at least that it was a necessity in human life, to which everyone must submit, to frequent the society of people who were, perhaps, not incapable of such actions. And he continued to shake hands with all the friends whom he had suspected, with the purely formal reservation that each one of them had, possibly, been seeking to drive him to despair. As for the actual contents of the letter, they did not disturb him; for in not one of the charges which it formulated against Odette could he see the least vestige of fact. Like many other men, Swann had a naturally lazy mind, and was slow in invention. He knew quite well as a general truth, that human life is full of contrasts, but in the case of any one human being he imagined all that part of his or her life with which he was not familiar as being identical with the part with which he was. He imagined what was kept secret from him in the light of what was revealed. At such times as he spent with Odette, if their conversation turned upon an indelicate act committed, or an indelicate sentiment expressed by some third person, she would ruthlessly condemn the culprit by virtue of the same moral principles which Swann had always heard expressed by his own parents, and to which he himself had remained loyal; and then, she would arrange her flowers, would sip her tea, would shew an interest in his work. So Swann extended those habits to fill the rest of her life, he reconstructed those actions when he wished to form a picture of the moments in which he and she were apart. If anyone had portrayed her to him as she was, or rather as she had been for so long with himself, but had substituted some other man, he would have been distressed, for such a portrait would have struck him as lifelike. But to suppose that she went to bad houses, that she abandoned herself to orgies with other women, that she led the crapulous existence of the most abject, the most contemptible of mortals—would be an insane wandering of the mind, for the realisation of which, thank heaven, the chrysanthemums that he could imagine, the daily cups of tea, the virtuous indignation left neither time nor place. Only, now and again, he gave Odette to understand that people maliciously kept him informed of everything that she did; and making opportune use of some detail—insignificant but true—which he had accidentally learned, as though it were the sole fragment which he would allow, in spite of himself, to pass his lips, out of the numberless other fragments of that complete reconstruction of her daily life which he carried secretly in his mind, he led her to suppose that he was perfectly informed upon matters, which, in reality, he neither knew nor suspected, for if he often adjured Odette never to swerve from or make alteration of the truth, that was only, whether he realised it or no, in order that Odette should tell him everything that she did. No doubt, as he used to assure Odette, he loved sincerity, but only as he might love a pander who could keep him in touch with the daily life of his mistress. Moreover, his love of sincerity, not being disinterested, had not improved his character. The truth which he cherished was that which Odette would tell him; but he himself, in order to extract that truth from her, was not afraid to have recourse to falsehood, that very falsehood which he never ceased to depict to Odette as leading every human creature down to utter degradation. In a word, he lied as much as did Odette, because, while more unhappy than she, he was no less egotistical. And she, when she heard him repeating thus to her the things that she had done, would stare at him with a look of distrust and, at all hazards, of indignation, so as not to appear to be humiliated, and to be blushing for her actions. One day, after the longest period of calm through which he had yet been able to exist without being overtaken by an attack of jealousy, he had accepted an invitation to spend the evening at the theatre with the Princesse des Laumes. Having opened his newspaper to find out what was being played, the sight of the title—Les Filles de Marbre, by Théodore Barrière,—struck him so cruel a blow that he recoiled instinctively from it and turned his head away. Illuminated, as though by a row of footlights, in the new surroundings in which it now appeared, that word 'marble,' which he had lost the power to distinguish, so often had it passed, in print, beneath his eyes, had suddenly become visible once again, and had at once brought back to his mind the story which Odette had told him, long ago, of a visit which she had paid to the Salon at the Palais d'Industrie with Mme. Verdurin, who had said to her, ""Take care, now! I know how to melt you, all right. You're not made of marble."" Odette had assured him that it was only a joke, and he had not attached any importance to it at the time. But he had had more confidence in her then than he had now. And the anonymous letter referred explicitly to relations of that sort. Without daring to lift his eyes to the newspaper, he opened it, turned the page so as not to see again the words, Filles de Marbre, and began to read mechanically the news from the provinces. There had been a storm in the Channel, and damage was reported from Dieppe, Cabourg, Beuzeval.... Suddenly he recoiled again in horror

   The name of Beuzeval had suggested to him that of another place in the same district, Beuzeville, which carried also, bound to it by a hyphen, a second name, to wit Bréauté, which he had often seen on maps, but without ever previously remarking that it was the same name as that borne by his friend M. de Bréauté, whom the anonymous letter accused of having been Odette's lover. After all, when it came to M. de Bréauté, there was nothing improbable in the charge; but so far as Mme. Verdurin was concerned, it was a sheer impossibility. From the fact that Odette did occasionally tell a lie, it was not fair to conclude that she never, by any chance, told the truth, and in these bantering conversations with Mme. Verdurin which she herself had repeated to Swann, he could recognize those meaningless and dangerous pleasantries which, in their inexperience of life and ignorance of vice, women often utter (thereby certifying their own innocence), who—as, for instance, Odette,—would be the last people in the world to feel any undue affection for one another. Whereas, on the other hand, the indignation with which she had scattered the suspicions which she had unintentionally brought into being, for a moment, in his mind by her story, fitted in with everything that he knew of the tastes, the temperament of his mistress. But at that moment, by an inspiration of jealousy, analogous to the inspiration which reveals to a poet or a philosopher, who has nothing, so far, but an odd pair of rhymes or a detached observation, the idea or the natural law which will give power, mastery to his work, Swann recalled for the first time a remark which Odette had made to him, at least two years before: ""Oh, Mme. Verdurin, she won't hear of anything just now but me. I'm a 'love,' if you please, and she kisses me, and wants me to go with her everywhere, and call her by her Christian name."" So far from seeing in these expressions any connection with the absurd insinuations, intended to create an atmosphere of vice, which Odette had since repeated to him, he had welcomed them as a proof of Mme. Verdurin's warm-hearted and generous friendship. But now this old memory of her affection for Odette had coalesced suddenly with his more recent memory of her unseemly conversation. He could no longer separate them in his mind, and he saw them blended in reality, the affection imparting a certain seriousness and importance to the pleasantries which, in return, spoiled the affection of its innocence. He went to see Odette. He sat down, keeping at a distance from her. He did not dare to embrace her, not knowing whether in her, in himself, it would be affection or anger that a kiss would provoke. He sat there silent, watching their love expire. Suddenly he made up his mind

   ""Odette, my darling,"" he began, ""I know, I am being simply odious, but I must ask you a few questions. You remember what I once thought about you and Mme. Verdurin? Tell me, was it true? Have you, with her or anyone else, ever?""

   She shook her head, pursing her lips together; a sign which people commonly employ to signify that they are not going, because it would bore them to go, when some one has asked, ""Are you coming to watch the procession go by?"", or ""Will you be at the review?"". But this shake of the head, which is thus commonly used to decline participation in an event that has yet to come, imparts for that reason an element of uncertainty to the denial of participation in an event that is past. Furthermore, it suggests reasons of personal convenience, rather than any definite repudiation, any moral impossibility. When he saw Odette thus make him a sign that the insinuation was false, he realised that it was quite possibly true

   ""I have told you, I never did; you know quite well,"" she added, seeming angry and uncomfortable

   ""Yes, I know all that; but are you quite sure? Don't say to me, 'You know quite well'; say, 'I have never done anything of that sort with any woman.'""

   She repeated his words like a lesson learned by rote, and as though she hoped, thereby, to be rid of him: ""I have never done anything of that sort with any woman.""

   ""Can you swear it to me on your Laghetto medal?""

   Swann knew that Odette would never perjure herself on that

   ""Oh, you do make me so miserable,"" she cried, with a jerk of her body as though to shake herself free of the constraint of his question. ""Have you nearly done? What is the matter with you to-day? You seem to have made up your mind that I am to be forced to hate you, to curse you! Look, I was anxious to be friends with you again, for us to have a nice time together, like the old days; and this is all the thanks I get!""

   However, he would not let her go, but sat there like a surgeon who waits for a spasm to subside that has interrupted his operation but need not make him abandon it

   ""You are quite wrong in supposing that I bear you the least ill-will in the world, Odette,"" he began with a persuasive and deceitful gentleness. ""I never speak to you except of what I already know, and I always know a great deal more than I say. But you alone can mollify by your confession what makes me hate you so long as it has been reported to me only by other people. My anger with you is never due to your actions—I can and do forgive you everything because I love you—but to your untruthfulness, the ridiculous untruthfulness which makes you persist in denying things which I know to be true. How can you expect that I shall continue to love you, when I see you maintain, when I hear you swear to me a thing which I know to be false? Odette, do not prolong this moment which is torturing us both. If you are willing to end it at once, you shall be free of it for ever. Tell me, upon your medal, yes or no, whether you have ever done those things.""

   ""How on earth can I tell?"" she was furious. ""Perhaps I have, ever so long ago, when I didn't know what I was doing, perhaps two or three times.""

   Swann had prepared himself for all possibilities. Reality must, therefore, be something which bears no relation to possibilities, any more than the stab of a knife in one's body bears to the gradual movement of the clouds overhead, since those words ""two or three times"" carved, as it were, a cross upon the living tissues of his heart. A strange thing, indeed, that those words, ""two or three times,"" nothing more than a few words, words uttered in the air, at a distance, could so lacerate a man's heart, as if they had actually pierced it, could sicken a man, like a poison that he had drunk. Instinctively Swann thought of the remark that he had heard at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's: ""I have never seen anything to beat it since the table-turning."" The agony that he now suffered in no way resembled what he had supposed. Not only because, in the hours when he most entirely mistrusted her, he had rarely imagined such a culmination of evil, but because, even when he did imagine that offence, it remained vague, uncertain, was not clothed in the particular horror which had escaped with the words ""perhaps two or three times,"" was not armed with that specific cruelty, as different from anything that he had known as a new malady by which one is attacked for the first time. And yet this Odette, from whom all this evil sprang, was no less dear to him, was, on the contrary, more precious, as if, in proportion as his sufferings increased, there increased at the same time the price of the sedative, of the antidote which this woman alone possessed. He wished to pay her more attention, as one attends to a disease which one discovers, suddenly, to have grown more serious. He wished that the horrible thing which, she had told him, she had done ""two or three times"" might be prevented from occurring again. To ensure that, he must watch over Odette. People often say that, by pointing out to a man the faults of his mistress, you succeed only in strengthening his attachment to her, because he does not believe you; yet how much more so if he does! But, Swann asked himself, how could he manage to protect her? He might perhaps be able to preserve her from the contamination of any one woman, but there were hundreds of other women; and he realised how insane had been his ambition when he had begun (on the evening when he had failed to find Odette at the Verdurins') to desire the possession—as if that were ever possible—of another person. Happily for Swann, beneath the mass of suffering which had invaded his soul like a conquering horde of barbarians, there lay a natural foundation, older, more placid, and silently laborious, like the cells of an injured organ which at once set to work to repair the damaged tissues, or the muscles of a paralysed limb which tend to recover their former movements. These older, these autochthonous in-dwellers in his soul absorbed all Swann's strength, for a while, in that obscure task of reparation which gives one an illusory sense of repose during convalescence, or after an operation. This time it was not so much—as it ordinarily was—in Swann's brain that the slackening of tension due to exhaustion took effect, it was rather in his heart. But all the things in life that have once existed tend to recur, and, like a dying animal that is once more stirred by the throes of a convulsion which was, apparently, ended, upon Swann's heart, spared for a moment only, the same agony returned of its own accord to trace the same cross again. He remembered those moonlit evenings, when, leaning back in the victoria that was taking him to the Rue La Pérouse, he would cultivate with voluptuous enjoyment the emotions of a man in love, ignorant of the poisoned fruit that such emotions must inevitably bear. But all those thoughts lasted for no more than a second, the time that it took him to raise his hand to his heart, to draw breath again and to contrive to smile, so as to dissemble his torment. Already he had begun to put further questions. For his jealousy, which had taken an amount of trouble, such as no enemy would have incurred, to strike him this mortal blow, to make him forcibly acquainted with the most cruel pain that he had ever known, his jealousy was not satisfied that he had yet suffered enough, and sought to expose his bosom to an even deeper wound. Like an evil deity, his jealousy was inspiring Swann, was thrusting him on towards destruction. It was not his fault, but Odette's alone, if at first his punishment was not more severe

   ""My darling,"" he began again, ""it's all over now; was it with anyone I know?""

   ""No, I swear it wasn't; besides, I think I exaggerated, I never really went as far as that.""

   He smiled, and resumed with: ""Just as you like. It doesn't really matter, but it's unfortunate that you can't give me any name. If I were able to form an idea of the person that would prevent my ever thinking of her again. I say it for your own sake, because then I shouldn't bother you any more about it. It's so soothing to be able to form a clear picture of things in one's mind. What is really terrible is what one cannot imagine. But you've been so sweet to me; I don't want to tire you. I do thank you, with all my heart, for all the good that you have done me. I've quite finished now. Only one word more: how many times?""

   ""Oh, Charles! can't you see, you're killing me? It's all ever so long ago. I've never given it a thought. Anyone would say that you were positively trying to put those ideas into my head again. And then you'd be a lot better off!"" she concluded, with unconscious stupidity but with intentional malice

   ""I only wished to know whether it had been since I knew you. It's only natural. Did it happen here, ever? You can't give me any particular evening, so that I can remind myself what I was doing at the time? You understand, surely, that it's not possible that you don't remember with whom, Odette, my love.""

   ""But I don't know; really, I don't. I think it was in the Bois, one evening when you came to meet us on the Island. You had been dining with the Princesse des Laumes,"" she added, happy to be able to furnish him with an exact detail, which testified to her veracity. ""At the next table there was a woman whom I hadn't seen for ever so long. She said to me, 'Come along round behind the rock, there, and look at the moonlight on the water!' At first I just yawned, and said, 'No, I'm too tired, and I'm quite happy where I am, thank you.' She swore there'd never been anything like it in the way of moonlight. 'I've heard that tale before,' I said to her; you see, I knew quite well what she was after."" Odette narrated this episode almost as if it were a joke, either because it appeared to her to be quite natural, or because she thought that she was thereby minimising its importance, or else so as not to appear ashamed. But, catching sight of Swann's face, she changed her tone, and:

   ""You are a fiend!"" she flung at him, ""you enjoy tormenting me, making me tell you lies, just so that you'll leave me in peace.""

   This second blow struck at Swann was even more excruciating than the first. Never had he supposed it to have been so recent an affair, hidden from his eyes that had been too innocent to discern it, not in a past which he had never known, but in evenings which he so well remembered, which he had lived through with Odette, of which he had supposed himself to have such an intimate, such an exhaustive knowledge, and which now assumed, retrospectively, an aspect of cunning and deceit and cruelty. In the midst of them parted, suddenly, a gaping chasm, that moment on the Island in the Bois de Boulogne. Without being intelligent, Odette had the charm of being natural. She had recounted, she had acted the little scene with so much simplicity that Swann, as he gasped for breath, could vividly see it: Odette yawning, the ""rock there,""... He could hear her answer—alas, how lightheartedly—""I've heard that tale before!"" He felt that she would tell him nothing more that evening, that no further revelation was to be expected for the present. He was silent for a time, then said to her:

   ""My poor darling, you must forgive me; I know, I am hurting you dreadfully, but it's all over now; I shall never think of it again.""

   But she saw that his eyes remained fixed upon the things that he did not know, and on that past era of their love, monotonous and soothing in his memory because it was vague, and now rent, as with a sword-wound, by the news of that minute on the Island in the Bois, by moonlight, while he was dining with the Princesse des Laumes. But he had so far acquired the habit of finding life interesting—of marvelling at the strange discoveries that there were to be made in it—that even while he was suffering so acutely that he did not believe it possible to endure such agony for any length of time, he was saying to himself: ""Life is indeed astonishing, and holds some fine surprises; it appears that vice is far more common than one has been led to believe. Here is a woman in whom I had absolute confidence, who looks so simple, so honest, who, in any case, even allowing that her morals are not strict, seemed quite normal and healthy in her tastes and inclinations. I receive a most improbable accusation, I question her, and the little that she admits reveals far more than I could ever have suspected."" But he could not confine himself to these detached observations. He sought to form an exact estimate of the importance of what she had just told him, so as to know whether he might conclude that she had done these things often, and was likely to do them again. He repeated her words to himself: ""I knew quite well what she was after."" ""Two or three times."" ""I've heard that tale before."" But they did not reappear in his memory unarmed; each of them held a knife with which it stabbed him afresh. For a long time, like a sick man who cannot restrain himself from attempting, every minute, to make the movement that, he knows, will hurt him, he kept on murmuring to himself: ""I'm quite happy where I am, thank you,"" ""I've heard that tale before,"" but the pain was so intense that he was obliged to stop. He was amazed to find that actions which he had always, hitherto, judged so lightly, had dismissed, indeed, with a laugh, should have become as serious to him as a disease which might easily prove fatal. He knew any number of women whom he could ask to keep an eye on Odette, but how was he to expect them to adjust themselves to his new point of view, and not to remain at that which for so long had been his own, which had always guided him in his voluptuous existence; not to say to him with a smile: ""You jealous monster, wanting to rob other people of their pleasure!"" By what trap-door, suddenly lowered, had he (who had never found, in the old days, in his love for Odette, any but the most refined of pleasures) been precipitated into this new circle of hell from which he could not see how he was ever to escape. Poor Odette! He wished her no harm. She was but half to blame. Had he not been told that it was her own mother who had sold her, when she was still little more than a child, at Nice, to a wealthy Englishman? But what an agonising truth was now contained for him in those lines of Alfred de Vigny's Journal d'un Poète which he had previously read without emotion: ""When one feels oneself smitten by love for a woman, one ought to say to oneself, 'What are 'her surroundings? What has been her life?' All one's future happiness lies in the answer."" Swann was astonished that such simple phrases, spelt over in his mind as, ""I've heard that tale before,"" or ""I knew quite well what she was after,"" could cause him so much pain. But he realised that what he had mistaken for simple phrases were indeed parts of the panoply which held and could inflict on him the anguish that he had felt while Odette was telling her story. For it was the same anguish that he now was feeling afresh. It was no good, his knowing now,—indeed, it was no good, as time went on, his having partly forgotten and altogether forgiven the offence—whenever he repeated her words his old anguish refashioned him as he had been before Odette began to speak: ignorant, trustful; his merciless jealousy placed him once again, so that he might be effectively wounded by Odette's admission, in the position of a man who does not yet know the truth; and after several months this old story would still dumbfounder him, like a sudden revelation. He marvelled at the terrible recreative power of his memory. It was only by the weakening of that generative force, whose fecundity diminishes as age creeps over one, that he could hope for a relaxation of his torments. But, as soon as the power that any one of Odette's sentences had to make Swann suffer seemed to be nearly exhausted, lo and behold another, one of those to which he had hitherto paid least attention, almost a new sentence, came to relieve the first, and to strike at him with undiminished force. The memory of the evening on which he had dined with the Princesse des Laumes was painful to him, but it was no more than the centre, the core of his pain. That radiated vaguely round about it, overflowing into all the preceding and following days. And on whatever point in it he might intend his memory to rest, it was the whole of that season, during which the Verdurins had so often gone to dine upon the Island in the Bois, that sprang back to hurt him. So violently, that by slow degrees the curiosity which his jealousy was ever exciting in him was neutralised by his fear of the fresh tortures which he would be inflicting upon himself were he to satisfy it. He recognised that all the period of Odette's life which had elapsed before she first met him, a period of which he had never sought to form any picture in his mind, was not the featureless abstraction which he could vaguely see, but had consisted of so many definite, dated years, each crowded with concrete incidents. But were he to learn more of them, he feared lest her past, now colourless, fluid and supportable, might assume a tangible, an obscene form, with individual and diabolical features. And he continued to refrain from seeking a conception of it, not any longer now from laziness of mind, but from fear of suffering. He hoped that, some day, he might be able to hear the Island in the Bois, or the Princesse des Laumes mentioned without feeling any twinge of that old rending pain; meanwhile he thought it imprudent to provoke Odette into furnishing him with fresh sentences, with the names of more places and people and of different events, which, when his malady was still scarcely healed, would make it break out again in another form

   But, often enough, the things that he did not know, that he dreaded, now, to learn, it was Odette herself who, spontaneously and without thought of what she did, revealed them to him; for the gap which her vices made between her actual life and the comparatively innocent life which Swann had believed, and often still believed his mistress to lead, was far wider than she knew. A vicious person, always affecting the same air of virtue before people whom he is anxious to keep from having any suspicion of his vices, has no register, no gauge at hand from which he may ascertain how far those vices (their continuous growth being imperceptible by himself) have gradually segregated him from the normal ways of life. In the course of their cohabitation, in Odette's mind, with the memory of those of her actions which she concealed from Swann, her other, her innocuous actions were gradually coloured, infected by these, without her being able to detect anything strange in them, without their causing any explosion in the particular region of herself in which she made them live, but when she related them to Swann, he was overwhelmed by the revelation of the duplicity to which they pointed. One day, he was trying—without hurting Odette—to discover from her whether she had ever had any dealings with procuresses. He was, as a matter of fact, convinced that she had not; the anonymous letter had put the idea into his mind, but in a purely mechanical way; it had been received there with no credulity, but it had, for all that, remained there, and Swann, wishing to be rid of the burden—a dead weight, but none the less disturbing—of this suspicion, hoped that Odette would now extirpate it for ever

   ""Oh dear, no! Not that they don't simply persecute me to go to them,"" her smile revealed a gratified vanity which she no longer saw that it was impossible should appear legitimate to Swann. ""There was one of them waited more than two hours for me yesterday, said she would give me any money I asked. It seems, there's an Ambassador who said to her, 'I'll kill myself if you don't bring her to me'—meaning me! They told her I'd gone out, but she waited and waited, and in the end I had to go myself and speak to her, before she'd go away. I do wish you could have seen the way I tackled her; my maid was in the next room, listening, and told me I shouted fit to bring the house down:—'But when you hear me say that I don't want to! The idea of such a thing, I don't like it at all! I should hope I'm still free to do as I please and when I please and where I please! If I needed the money, I could understand...' The porter has orders not to let her in again; he will tell her that I am out of town. Oh, I do wish I could have had you hidden somewhere in the room while I was talking to her. I know, you'd have been pleased, my dear. There's some good in your little Odette, you see, after all, though people do say such dreadful things about her.""

   Besides, her very admissions—when she made any—of faults which she supposed him to have discovered, rather served Swann as a starting-point for fresh doubts than they put an end to the old. For her admissions never exactly coincided with his doubts. In vain might Odette expurgate her confession of all its essential part, there would remain in the accessories something which Swann had never yet imagined, which crushed him anew, and was to enable him to alter the terms of the problem of his jealousy. And these admissions he could never forget. His spirit carried them along, cast them aside, then cradled them again in its bosom, like corpses in a river. And they poisoned it

   She spoke to him once of a visit that Forcheville had paid her on the day of the Paris-Murcie Fête. ""What! you knew him as long ago as that? Oh, yes, of course you did,"" he corrected himself, so as not to shew that he had been ignorant of the fact. And suddenly he began to tremble at the thought that, on the day of the Paris-Murcie Fête, when he had received that letter which he had so carefully preserved, she had been having luncheon, perhaps, with Forcheville at the Maison d'Or. She swore that she had not. ""Still, the Maison d'Or reminds me of something or other which, I knew at the time, wasn't true,"" he pursued, hoping to frighten her. ""Yes that I hadn't been there at all that evening when I told you I had just come from there, and you had been looking for me at Prévost's,"" she replied (judging by his manner that he knew) with a firmness that was based not so much upon cynicism as upon timidity, a fear of crossing Swann, which her own self-respect made her anxious to conceal, and a desire to shew him that she could be perfectly frank if she chose. And so she struck him with all the sharpness and force of a headsman wielding his axe, and yet could not be charged with cruelty, since she was quite unconscious of hurting him; she even began to laugh, though this may perhaps, it is true, have been chiefly to keep him from thinking that she was ashamed, at all, or confused. ""It's quite true, I hadn't been to the Maison Dorée. I was coming away from Forcheville's. I had, really, been to Prévost's—that wasn't a story—and he met me there and asked me to come in and look at his prints. But some one else came to see him. I told you that I was coming from the Maison d'Or because I was afraid you might be angry with me. It was rather nice of me, really, don't you see? I admit, I did wrong, but at least I'm telling you all about it now, a'n't I? What have I to gain by not telling you, straight, that I lunched with him on the day of the Paris-Murcie Fête, if it were true? Especially as at that time we didn't know one another quite so well as we do now, did we, dear?""

   He smiled back at her with the sudden, craven weakness of the utterly spiritless creature which these crushing words had made of him. And so, even in the months of which he had never dared to think again, because they had been too happy, in those months when she had loved him, she was already lying to him! Besides that moment (that first evening on which they had ""done a cattleya"") when she had told him that she was coming from the Maison Dorée, how many others must there have been, each of them covering a falsehood of which Swann had had no suspicion. He recalled how she had said to him once: ""I need only tell Mme. Verdurin that my dress wasn't ready, or that my cab came late. There is always some excuse."" From himself too, probably, many times when she had glibly uttered such words as explain a delay or justify an alteration of the hour fixed for a meeting, those moments must have hidden, without his having the least inkling of it at the time, an engagement that she had had with some other man, some man to whom she had said: ""I need only tell Swann that my dress wasn't ready, or that my cab came late. There is always some excuse."" And beneath all his most pleasant memories, beneath the simplest words that Odette had ever spoken to him in those old days, words which he had believed as though they were the words of a Gospel, beneath her daily actions which she had recounted to him, beneath the most ordinary places, her dressmaker's flat, the Avenue du Bois, the Hippodrome, he could feel (dissembled there, by virtue of that temporal superfluity which, after the most detailed account of how a day has been spent, always leaves something over, that may serve as a hiding place for certain unconfessed actions), he could feel the insinuation of a possible undercurrent of falsehood which debased for him all that had remained most precious, his happiest evenings, the Rue La Pérouse itself, which Odette must constantly have been leaving at other hours than those of which she told him; extending the power of the dark horror that had gripped him when he had heard her admission with regard to the Maison Dorée, and, like the obscene creatures in the 'Desolation of Nineveh,' shattering, stone by stone, the whole edifice of his past.... If, now, he turned aside whenever his memory repeated the cruel name of the Maison Dorée it was because that name recalled to him, no longer, as, such a little time since, at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's party, the good fortune which he long had lost, but a misfortune of which he was now first aware. Then it befell the Maison Dorée, as it had befallen the Island in the Bois, that gradually its name ceased to trouble him. For what we suppose to be our love, our jealousy are, neither of them, single, continuous and individual passions. They are composed of an infinity of successive loves, of different jealousies, each of which is ephemeral, although by their uninterrupted multitude they give us the impression of continuity, the illusion of unity. The life of Swann's love, the fidelity of his jealousy, were formed out of death, of infidelity, of innumerable desires, innumerable doubts, all of which had Odette for their object. If he had remained for any length of time without seeing her, those that died would not have been replaced by others. But the presence of Odette continued to sow in Swann's heart alternate seeds of love and suspicion

   On certain evenings she would suddenly resume towards him a kindness of which she would warn him sternly that he must take immediate advantage, under penalty of not seeing it repeated for years to come; he must instantly accompany her home, to ""do a cattleya,"" and the desire which she pretended to have for him was so sudden, so inexplicable, so imperious, the kisses which she lavished on him were so demonstrative and so unfamiliar, that this brutal and unnatural fondness made Swann just as unhappy as any lie or unkind action. One evening when he had thus, in obedience to her command, gone home with her, and while she was interspersing her kisses with passionate words, in strange contrast to her habitual coldness, he thought suddenly that he heard a sound; he rose, searched everywhere and found nobody, but he had not the courage to return to his place by her side; whereupon she, in a towering rage, broke a vase, with ""I never can do anything right with you, you impossible person!"" And he was left uncertain whether she had not actually had some man concealed in the room, whose jealousy she had wished to wound, or else to inflame his senses

   Sometimes he repaired to 'gay' houses, hoping to learn something about Odette, although he dared not mention her name. ""I have a little thing here, you're sure to like,"" the 'manageress' would greet him, and he would stay for an hour or so, talking dolefully to some poor girl who sat there astonished that he went no further. One of them, who was still quite young and attractive, said to him once, ""Of course, what I should like would be to find a real friend, then he might be quite certain, I should never go with any other men again."" ""Indeed, do you think it possible for a woman really to be touched by a man's being in love with her, and never to be unfaithful to him?"" asked Swann anxiously. ""Why, surely! It all depends on their characters!"" Swann could not help making the same remarks to these girls as would have delighted the Princesse des Laumes. To the one who was in search of a friend he said, with a smile: ""But how nice of you, you've put on blue eyes, to go with your sash."" ""And you too, you've got blue cuffs on."" ""What a charming conversation we are having, for a place of this sort! I'm not boring you, am I; or keeping you?"" ""No, I've nothing to do, thank you. If you bored me I should say so. But I love hearing you talk."" ""I am highly flattered.... Aren't we behaving prettily?"" he asked the 'manageress,' who had just looked in. ""Why, yes, that's just what I was saying to myself, how sensibly they're behaving! But that's how it is! People come to my house now, just to talk. The Prince was telling me, only the other day, that he's far more comfortable here than with his wife. It seems that, nowadays, all the society ladies are like that; a perfect scandal, I call it. But I'll leave you in peace now, I know when I'm not wanted,"" she ended discreetly, and left Swann with the girl who had the blue eyes. But presently he rose and said good-bye to her. She had ceased to interest him. She did not know Odette

   The painter having been ill, Dr. Cottard recommended a sea-voyage; several of the 'faithful' spoke of accompanying him; the Verdurins could not face the prospect of being left alone in Paris, so first of all hired, and finally purchased a yacht; thus Odette was constantly going on a cruise. Whenever she had been away for any length of time, Swann would feel that he was beginning to detach himself from her, but, as though this moral distance were proportionate to the physical distance between them, whenever he heard that Odette had returned to Paris, he could not rest without seeing her. Once, when they had gone away, as everyone thought, for a month only, either they succumbed to a series of temptations, or else M. Verdurin had cunningly arranged everything beforehand, to please his wife, and disclosed his plans to the 'faithful' only as time went on; anyhow, from Algiers they flitted to Tunis; then to Italy, Greece, Constantinople, Asia Minor. They had been absent for nearly a year, and Swann felt perfectly at ease and almost happy. Albeit M. Verdurin had endeavoured to persuade the pianist and Dr. Cottard that their respective aunt and patients had no need of them, and that, in any event, it was most rash to allow Mme. Cottard to return to Paris, where, Mme. Verdurin assured him, a revolution had just broken out, he was obliged to grant them their liberty at Constantinople. And the painter came home with them. One day, shortly after the return of these four travellers, Swann, seeing an omnibus approach him, labelled 'Luxembourg,' and having some business there, had jumped on to it and had found himself sitting opposite Mme. Cottard, who was paying a round of visits to people whose 'day' it was, in full review order, with a plume in her hat, a silk dress, a muff, an umbrella (which do for a parasol if the rain kept off), a card-case, and a pair of white gloves fresh from the cleaners. Wearing these badges of rank, she would, in fine weather, go on foot from one house to another in the same neighbourhood, but when she had to proceed to another district, would make use of a transfer-ticket on the omnibus. For the first minute or two, until the natural courtesy of the woman broke through the starched surface of the doctor's-wife, not being certain, either, whether she ought to mention the Verdurins before Swann, she produced, quite naturally, in her slow and awkward, but not unattractive voice, which, every now and then, was completely drowned by the rattling of the omnibus, topics selected from those which she had picked up and would repeat in each of the score of houses up the stairs of which she clambered in the course of an afternoon

   ""I needn't ask you, M. Swann, whether a man so much in the movement as yourself has been to the Mirlitons, to see the portrait by Machard that the whole of Paris is running after. Well, and what do you think of it? Whose camp are you in, those who bless or those who curse? It's the same in every house in Paris now, no one will speak of anything else but Machard's portrait; you aren't smart, you aren't really cultured, you aren't up-to-date unless you give an opinion on Machard's portrait.""

   Swann having replied that he had not seen this portrait, Mme. Cottard was afraid that she might have hurt his feelings by obliging him to confess the omission

   ""Oh, that's quite all right! At least you have the courage to be quite frank about it. You don't consider yourself disgraced because you haven't seen Machard's portrait. I do think that so nice of you. Well now, I have seen it; opinion is divided, you know, there are some people who find it rather laboured, like whipped cream, they say; but I think it's just ideal. Of course, she's not a bit like the blue and yellow ladies that our friend Biche paints. That's quite clear. But I must tell you, perfectly frankly (you'll think me dreadfully old-fashioned, but I always say just what I think), that I don't understand his work. I can quite see the good points there are in his portrait of my husband; oh, dear me, yes; and it's certainly less odd than most of what he does, but even then he had to give the poor man a blue moustache! But Machard! Just listen to this now, the husband of my friend, I am on my way to see at this very moment (which has given me the very great pleasure of your company), has promised her that, if he is elected to the Academy (he is one of the Doctor's colleagues), he will get Machard to paint her portrait. So she's got something to look forward to! I have another friend who insists that she'd rather have Leloir. I'm only a wretched Philistine, and I've no doubt Leloir has perhaps more knowledge of painting even than Machard. But I do think that the most important thing about a portrait, especially when it's going to cost ten thousand francs, is that it should be like, and a pleasant likeness, if you know what I mean.""

   Having exhausted this topic, to which she had been inspired by the loftiness of her plume, the monogram on her card-case, the little number inked inside each of her gloves by the cleaner, and the difficulty of speaking to Swann about the Verdurins, Mme. Cottard, seeing that they had still a long way to go before they would reach the corner of the Rue Bonaparte, where the conductor was to set her down, listened to the promptings of her heart, which counselled other words than these

   ""Your ears must have been burning,"" she ventured, ""while we were on the yacht with Mme. Verdurin. We were talking about you all the time.""

   Swann was genuinely astonished, for he supposed that his name was never uttered in the Verdurins' presence

   ""You see,"" Mme. Cottard went on, ""Mme. de Crécy was there; need I say more? When Odette is anywhere it's never long before she begins talking about you. And you know quite well, it isn't nasty things she says. What! you don't believe me!"" she went on, noticing that Svrann looked sceptical. And, carried away by the sincerity of her conviction, without putting any evil meaning into the word, which she used purely in the sense in which one employs it to speak of the affection that unites a pair of friends: ""Why, she adores you! No, indeed; I'm sure it would never do to say anything against you when she was about; one would soon be taught one's place! Whatever we might be doing, if we were looking at a picture, for instance, she would say, 'If only we had him here, he's the man who could tell us whether it's genuine or not. There's no one like him for that.' And all day long she would be saying, 'What can he be doing just now? I do hope, he's doing a little work! It's too dreadful that a fellow with such gifts as he has should be so lazy.' (Forgive me, won't you.) 'I can see him this very moment; he's thinking of us, he's wondering where we are.' Indeed, she used an expression which I thought very pretty at the time. M. Verdurin asked her, 'How in the world can you see what he's doing, when he's a thousand miles away?' And Odette answered, 'Nothing is impossible to the eye of a friend.'

   ""No, I assure you, I'm not saying it just to flatter you; you have a true friend in her, such as one doesn't often find. I can tell you, besides, in case you don't know it, that you're the only one. Mme. Verdurin told me as much herself on our last day with them (one talks more freely, don't you know, before a parting), 'I don't say that Odette isn't fond of us, but anything that we may say to her counts for very little beside what Swann might say.' Oh, mercy, there's the conductor stopping for me; here have I been chatting away to you, and would have gone right past the Rue Bonaparte, and never noticed... Will you be so very kind as to tell me whether my plume is straight?""

   And Mme. Cottard withdrew from her muff, to offer it to Swann, a white-gloved hand from which there floated, with a transier-ticket, an atmosphere of fashionable life that pervaded the omnibus, blended with the harsher fragrance of newly cleaned kid. And Swann felt himself overflowing with gratitude to her, as well as to Mme. Verdurin (and almost to Odette, for the feeling that he now entertained for her was no longer tinged with pain, was scarcely even to be described, now, as love), while from the platform of the omnibus he followed her with loving eyes, as she gallantly threaded her way along the Rue Bonaparte, her plume erect, her skirt held up in one hand, while in the other she clasped her umbrella and her card-case, so that its monogram could be seen, her muff dancing in the air before her as she went

   To compete with and so to stimulate the moribund feelings that Swann had for Odette, Mme. Cottard, a wiser physician, in this case, than ever her husband would have been, had grafted among them others more normal, feelings of gratitude, of friendship, which in Swann's mind were to make Odette seem again more human (more like other women, since other women could inspire the same feelings in him), were to hasten her final transformation back into that Odette, loved with an undisturbed affection, who had taken him home one evening after a revel at the painter's, to drink orangeade with Forcheville, that Odette with whom Swann had calculated that he might live in happiness

   In former times, having often thought with terror that a day must come when he would cease to be in love with Odette, he had determined to keep a sharp look-out, and as soon as he felt that love was beginning to escape him, to cling tightly to it and to hold it back. But now, to the faintness of his love there corresponded a simultaneous faintness in his desire to remain her lover. For a man cannot change, that is to say become another person, while he continues to obey the dictates of the self which he has ceased to be. Occasionally the name, if it caught his eye in a newspaper, of one of the men whom he supposed to have been Odette's lovers, reawakened his jealousy. But it was very slight, and, inasmuch as it proved to him that he had not completely emerged from that period in which he had so keenly suffered—though in it he had also known a way of feeling so intensely happy—and that the accidents of his course might still enable him to catch an occasional glimpse, stealthily and at a distance, of its beauties, this jealousy gave him, if anything, an agreeable thrill, as to the sad Parisian, when he has left Venice behind him and must return to France, a last mosquito proves that Italy and summer are still not too remote. But, as a rule, with this particular period of his life from which he was emerging, when he made an effort, if not to remain in it, at least to obtain, while still he might, an uninterrupted view of it, he discovered that already it was too late; he would have looked back to distinguish, as it might be a landscape that was about to disappear, that love from which he had departed, but it is so difficult to enter into a state of complete duality and to present to oneself the lifelike spectacle of a feeling which one has ceased to possess, that very soon, the clouds gathering in his brain, he could see nothing, he would abandon the attempt, would take the glasses from his nose and wipe them; and he told himself that he would do better to rest for a little, that there would be time enough later on, and settled back into his corner with as little curiosity, with as much torpor as the drowsy traveller who pulls his cap down over his eyes so as to get some sleep in the railway-carriage that is drawing him, he feels, faster and faster, out of the country in which he has lived for so long, and which he vowed that he would not allow to slip away from him without looking out to bid it a last farewell. Indeed, like the same traveller, if he does not awake until he has crossed the frontier and is again in France, when Swann happened to alight, close at hand, upon something which proved that Forcheville had been Odette's lover, he discovered that it caused him no pain, that love was now utterly remote, and he regretted that he had had no warning of the moment in which he had emerged from it for ever. And just as, before kissing Odette for the first time, he had sought to imprint upon his memory the face that for so long had been familiar, before it was altered by the additional memory of their kiss, so he could have wished—in thought at least—to have been in a position to bid farewell, while she still existed, to that Odette who had inspired love in him and jealousy, to that Odette who had caused him so to suffer, and whom now he would never see again. He was mistaken. He was destined to see her once again, a few weeks later. It was while he was asleep, in the twilight of a dream. He was walking with Mme. Verdurin, Dr. Cottard, a young man in a fez whom he failed to identify, the painter, Odette, Napoleon III and my grandfather, along a path which followed the line of the coast, and overhung the sea, now at a great height, now by a few feet only, so that they were continually going up and down; those of the party who had reached the downward slope were no longer visible to those who were still climbing; what little daylight yet remained was failing, and it seemed as though a black night was immediately to fall on them. Now and then the waves dashed against the cliff, and Swann could feel on his cheek a shower of freezing spray. Odette told him to wipe this off, but he could not, and felt confused and helpless in her company, as well as because he was in his nightshirt. He hoped that, in the darkness, this might pass unnoticed; Mme. Verdurin, however, fixed her astonished gaze upon him for an endless moment, in which he saw her face change its shape, her nose grow longer, while beneath it there sprouted a heavy moustache. He turned away to examine Odette; her cheeks were pale, with little fiery spots, her features drawn and ringed with shadows; but she looked back at him with eyes welling with affection, ready to detach themselves like tears and to fall upon his face, and he felt that he loved her so much that he would have liked to carry her off with him at once. Suddenly Odette turned her wrist, glanced at a tiny watch, and said: ""I must go."" She took leave of everyone, in the same formal manner, without taking Swann aside, without telling him where they were to meet that evening, or next day. He dared not ask, he would have liked to follow her, he was obliged, without turning back in her direction, to answer with a smile some question by Mme. Verdurin; but his heart was frantically beating, he felt that he now hated Odette, he would gladly have crushed those eyes which, a moment ago, he had loved so dearly, have torn the blood into those lifeless cheeks. He continued to climb with Mme. Verdurin, that is to say that each step took him farther from Odette, who was going downhill, and in the other direction. A second passed and it was many hours since she had left him. The painter remarked to Swann that Napoleon III had eclipsed himself immediately after Odette. ""They had obviously arranged it between them,"" he added; ""they must have agreed to meet at the foot of the cliff, but they wouldn't say good-bye together; it might have looked odd. She is his mistress."" The strange young man burst into tears. Swann endeavoured to console him. ""After all, she is quite right,"" he said to the young man, drying his eyes for him and taking off the fez to make him feel more at ease. ""I've advised her to do that, myself, a dozen times. Why be so distressed? He was obviously the man to understand her."" So Swann reasoned with himself, for the young man whom he had failed, at first, to identify, was himself also; like certain novelists, he had distributed his own personality between two characters, him who was the 'first person' in the dream, and another whom he saw before him, capped with a fez

   As for Napoleon III, it was to Forcheville that some vague association of ideas, then a certain modification of the Baron's usual physiognomy, and lastly the broad ribbon of the Legion of Honour across his breast, had made Swann give that name; but actually, and in everything that the person who appeared in his dream represented and recalled to him, it was indeed Forcheville. For, from an incomplete and changing set of images, Swann in his sleep drew false deductions, enjoying, at the same time, such creative power that he was able to reproduce himself by a simple act of division, like certain lower organisms; with the warmth that he felt in his own palm he modelled the hollow of a strange hand which he thought that he was clasping, and out of feelings and impressions of which he was not yet conscious, he brought about sudden vicissitudes which, by a chain of logical sequences, would produce, at definite points in his dream, the person required to receive his love or to startle him awake. In an instant night grew black about him; an alarum rang, the inhabitants ran past him, escaping from their blazing houses; he could hear the thunder of the surging waves, and also of his own heart, which, with equal violence, was anxiously beating in his breast. Suddenly the speed of these palpitations redoubled, he felt a pain, a nausea that were inexplicable; a peasant, dreadfully burned, flung at him as he passed: ""Come and ask Charlus where Odette spent the night with her friend. He used to go about with her, and she tells him everything. It was they that started the fire."" It was his valet, come to awaken him, and saying:—

   ""Sir, it is eight o'clock, and the barber is here. I have told him to call again in an hour.""

   But these words, as they dived down through the waves of sleep in which Swann was submerged, did not reach his consciousness without undergoing that refraction which turns a ray of light, at the bottom of a bowl of water, into another sun; just as, a moment earlier, the sound of the door-bell, swelling in the depths of his abyss of sleep into the clangour of an alarum, had engendered the episode of the fire. Meanwhile the scenery of his dream-stage scattered in dust, he opened his eyes, heard for the last time the boom of a wave in the sea, grown very distant. He touched his cheek. It was dry. And yet he could feel the sting of the cold spray, and the taste of salt on his lips. He rose, and dressed himself. He had made the barber come early because he had written, the day before, to my grandfather, to say that he was going, that afternoon, to Combray, having learned that Mme. de Cambremer—Mlle. Legrandin that had been—was spending a few days there. The association in his memory of her young and charming face with a place in the country which he had not visited for so long, offered him a combined attraction which had made him decide at last to leave Paris for a while. As the different changes and chances that bring us into the company of certain other people in this life do not coincide with the periods in which we are in love with those people, but, overlapping them, may occur before love has begun, and may be repeated after love is ended, the earliest appearances, in our life, of a creature who is destined to afford us pleasure later on, assume retrospectively in our eyes a certain value as an indication, a warning, a presage. It was in this fashion that Swann had often carried back his mind to the image of Odette, encountered in the theatre, on that first evening when he had no thought of ever seeing her again—and that he now recalled the party at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's, at which he had introduced General de Frober-ville to Mme. de Cambremer. So manifold are our interests in life that it is not uncommon that, on a single occasion, the foundations of a happiness which does not yet exist are laid down simultaneously with aggravations of a grief from which we are still suffering. And, no doubt, that might have occurred to Swann elsewhere than at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's. Who, indeed, can say whether, in the event of his having gone, that evening, somewhere else, other happinesses, other griefs would not have come to him, which, later, would have appeared to have been inevitable? But what did seem to him to have been inevitable was what had indeed taken place, and he was not far short of seeing something providential in the fact that he had at last decided to go to Mme. de Saint-Euverte's that evening, because his mind, anxious to admire the richness of invention that life shews, and incapable of facing a difficult problem for any length of time, such as to discover what, actually, had been most to be wished for, came to the conclusion that the sufferings through which he had passed that evening, and the pleasures, at that time unsuspected, which were already being brought to birth,—the exact balance between which was too difficult to establish—were linked by a sort of concatenation of necessity

   But while, an hour after his awakening, he was giving instructions to the barber, so that his stiffly brushed hair should not become disarranged on the journey, he thought once again of his dream; he saw once again, as he had felt them close beside him, Odette's pallid complexion, her too thin cheeks, her drawn features, her tired eyes, all the things which—in the course of those successive bursts of affection which had made of his enduring love for Odette a long oblivion of the first impression that he had formed of her—he had ceased to observe after the first few days of their intimacy, days to which, doubtless, while he slept, his memory had returned to seek the exact sensation of those things. And with that old, intermittent fatuity, which reappeared in him now that he was no longer unhappy, and lowered, at the same time, the average level of his morality, he cried out in his heart: ""To think that I have wasted years of my life, that I have longed for death, that the greatest love that I have ever known has been for a woman who did not please me, who was not in my style!""",[],0,Marcel Proust,Nicholas David,2012,[96],1,Somewhere Over the Rainbow - The Voice Performance,https://open.spotify.com/track/1s1x98eyZBTFpQ1KRCRd8f,1s1x98eyZBTFpQ1KRCRd8f,spotify:track:1s1x98eyZBTFpQ1KRCRd8f,The Complete Season 3 Collection (The Voice Performance),0la2kMnHy16yQAzjnGkDkx,spotify:album:0la2kMnHy16yQAzjnGkDkx,Nicholas David,2r7f7tP46hkr4U6nMpzzQx,spotify:artist:2r7f7tP46hkr4U6nMpzzQx,210.85299999999998,12.0,16.0,2012-01-01,0.29100000000000004,0.695,0.0,-4.977,1.0,0.0468,0.0746,1.25e-05,0.158,0.17800000000000002,141.696,['deep talent show'],[],

Mama was an angel in the ground

108,108,Fastest Girl In Town,"[Intro]
You’ve got the bullets
I got the gun
I got a hankerin' for getting into somethin'
I hit the bottle, you hit the gas
I heard your 65 can really haul some ass

[Verse 1]
I’m feelin' frisky, you're feelin' good
I guess the whiskey is doin' what it should
I got the cigarettes
You’ve got a lighter
And when the sun goes down, we’ll start a little fire

[Chorus]
Ain’t no use in tryin' to slow me down
‘Cause you’re runnin' with the fastest girl in town
Ain’t ya, baby?
I like ‘em crazy

[Verse 2]
My reputation follows me around
Just makes me wanna give them more to talk about
Let’s go to town for a little while
I’ll be wearing nothin' but a tattoo and a smile

[Chorus]
Ain’t no use in tryin' to slow me down
‘Cause you’re runnin' with the fastest girl in town
Ain’t ya, baby?
You're kinda crazy

[Break]
Come on!

[Verse 3]
I see the blue lights, we better run
Throw out the bottle and I’ll hide the gun
If he pulls us over, I’ll turn on the charm
You’ll be in the slammer and I’ll be on his arm

[Chorus]
Ain’t no use in tryin' to slow me down
‘Cause you’re runnin' with the fastest girl in town
Ain’t ya, baby?
Well, I told you I was crazy
No, I ain’t nobody’s baby
Hey!

109,109,Take A Little Ride,"[Verse 1]
Been going round and round all day
Bailing some hay and stacking it all up
Can't wait for the sun to go down
Roll into town, shine the old truck up
Swing by the quick stop
Grab a couple Shiner Bock
Then ease on out your way
To your place around eight o'clock

[Chorus]
Well I'm just ready to ride this Chevy
Ride this Chevy down a little back road
Slide your pretty little self on over
Get a little closer, turn up the radio
Put your pretty pink toes on the dash
Lean your seat back
Man I swear there ain't nothing looks better than that
Sweet tan, little thing with nothing to do
I want to take a little ride with you

[Verse 2]
I hope you are wearing those frayed out cut-offs
Makes me want to get lost out in the moonlight
Drop the tailgate down on a turn road
Watch the corn grow, baby that is a good night
Anyone from the heartland is going to understand
What I am talking about right now
Ain't no doubt, we got a game plan

[Chorus]
Well I'm just ready to ride this Chevy
Ride this Chevy down a little back road
Slide your pretty little self on over
Get a little closer, turn up the radio
Put your pretty pink toes on the dash
Lean your seat back
Man I swear there ain't nothing looks better than that
Sweet tan, little thing with nothing to do
I want to take a little ride with you

Well I'm just ready to ride this Chevy
Ride this Chevy down a little back road
Slide your pretty little self on over
Get a little closer, so you can play my radio
Put your pretty pink toes on the dash
Lean your seat back
Man I swear there ain't nothing looks better than that
Sweet tan, little thing with nothing to do
I want to take a little ride with you
Take a little ride with you

Yo, my best friend, best friend 'til the very end
'Cause best friends, best friends don't have to pretend
You need a hand, and I'm right there right beside you
You in the dark, I'll be the bright light to guide you
'Member the times, times, times sneaking out the house
All of the times, times, times that you had your doubts
And don't forget all the trouble we got into
We got something you can't undo, do

[Pre-Chorus: Cher Lloyd]
Laughing so damn hard
Crashed your dad's new car
All the scars we share
I promise, I swear

[Chorus: Cher Lloyd]
Wherever you go, just always remember
That you got a home for now and forever
And if you get low, just call me whenever
This is my oath to you
Wherever you go, just always remember
You're never alone, we're birds of a feather
And we'll never change, no matter the weather
This is my oath to you

[Verse 2: Becky G]
I know I drive you crazy, hmm, sometimes
I know I call you lazy, and that's most times
But you complete me, and that's no lie
You are my tuxedo, and I'm your bow tie
We in the car, sing, sing, singing our song
Walk in the building, tear it down, like we King Kong
And in my eyes, you can't do, do no wrong
You got a best friend sing, sing along

[Pre-Chorus: Becky G & Cher Lloyd]
Laughing so damn hard
Crashed your dad's new car
All the scars we share
I promise, I swear

Wherever you go, just always remember
That you got a home for now and forever
And if you get low, just call me whenever
This is my oath to you
Wherever you go, just always remember
You're never alone, we're birds of a feather
And we'll never change, no matter the weather
This is my oath to you

Oh, I'll never let you go
Oh, whoa, this is my oath to you
Oh, just thought that you should know
Oh, whoa, this is my oath to you
Yeah

Wherever you go, just always remember
That you got a home for now and forever
And if you get low, just call me whenever
This is my oath to you
Wherever you go, just always remember
You're never alone, we're birds of a feather
And we'll never change, no matter the weather
This is my oath to you

[Outro: Cher Lloyd]
Oh, you should know, you should know
You should know, you should know, yeah
Oh, whoa, this is my oath to you
(Wherever you go, just always remember)

July moonlight shines
Your pretty little head on my shoulder
Pull over on the side of the road
Oh my God, you're something
Like nothing I've ever seen
If I'm asleep girl, let me dream

[Chorus]
Baby fall into my kiss
It should just happen like this
Trust it so much that there's no one else but us and
This moment that says it's so right
Cause that's all we have in this life
Drink up this love, baby, give it all we got tonight

[Verse 2]
Summer honeysuckle
Leaking through a rolled down window
We both know when that seat lays back
Anything can happen
So imagine it'll never end
Just close your eyes and you can see that we are where we're meant to be

Baby fall into my kiss

115,115,50 Ways To Say Goodbye,"[Verse 1]
My heart is paralyzed
My head was oversized
I'll take the high road like I should
You said it's meant to be
That it's not you, it's me
You're leaving now for my own good

That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say

[Hook 1]
She went down in an airplane
Fried getting suntanned
Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!
She met a shark under water
Fell and no one caught her
I returned everything I ever bought her
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies
And ways to say you died

[Verse 2]
My pride still feels the sting
You were my everything
Some day I'll find a love like yours (a love like yours)
She'll think I'm Superman
Not super minivan
How could you leave on Yom Kippur?

That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say

[Hook 2]
She was caught in a mudslide
Eaten by a lion
Got run over by a crappy purple Scion
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!
She dried up in the desert
Drowned in a hot tub
Danced to death at an east side night club
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies
And ways to say you died

[Bridge]
I wanna live a thousand lives with you
I wanna be the one you're dying to love...
But you don't want to

That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say

A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
They're gonna rip it off
Taking their time right behind my back

And I'm talking to myself at night
Because I can't forget
Back and forth through my mind
Behind a cigarette

And the message coming from my eyes
Says, ""Leave it alone""

Don't want to hear about it
Every single one's got a story to tell
Everyone knows about it
From the Queen of England to the Hounds of Hell

And if I catch it coming back my way
I'm gonna serve it to you
And that ain't what you want to hear
But that's what I'll do

And the feeling coming from my bones
Says, ""Find a home""

I'm going to Wichita
Far from this opera for evermore
I'm gonna work the straw
Make the sweat drip out of every pore

And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding
Right before the Lord
All the words are gonna bleed from me
And I will think no more

She wants me to come over
I can tell her eyes don't lie
She's calling me in the dark
She moves, I swear the room
Around her lights up like the sky
Confidence like a rockstar

[Verse 2: Max]
I wanna put my hands on her hands
Feel the heat from her skin
Get reckless in the star light
I'm moving to the beat of her heart
I was so lost until tonight
Tonight

[Chorus]
I found you in the darkest hour
I found you in the pouring rain
I found you when I was on my knees
And your light brought me back again
Found you in a river of pure emotion
I found you, my only truth
I found you and the music played

[Break]
I was lost
Till I found you, you, you
Till I found you, you, you

[Verse 3: Tom]
The night is getting older
And I can't come off this high
I don't want this here to end
[Siva]
I know she feels the same
Cause I can see it in her eyes
She says ""Can we start again?""

[Verse 4: Max]
I wanna put my hands on her hands
Feel the heat from her skin
Get reckless in the star light

Found you in a river of pure emotion

I found you, you, you
I found you, you, you
I found you, you, you

[Verse 5: Nathan]
I said people
We're all looking for love tonight
But sometimes we can't see it
We're all blinded by the light
And we all get low, all get low
Searching for that peace of mind
Just when I'd given up
Looking for some kind of sign

That's when I found you, you, you
I found you, you, you
I found you, you, you

Where are the plans we made for two?

Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be...
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me

You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

If ""Happy Ever Afters"" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick

Oh, you turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away

You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I've said it before
But all of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

If ""Happy Ever Afters"" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick
Now I'm at a payphone

[Wiz Khalifa]
Man, fuck that shit
I'll be out spending all this money
While you're sitting round wondering
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me I'm stunting
And all of my cars start with a push of a button

Telling me the chances I blew up
Or whatever you call it
Switch the number to my phone
So you never could call it
Don't need my name on my show
You can tell it I'm ballin

Swish, what a shame could have got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could have saw but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up valet open doors
Wiz like go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want, so you can go and take
That little piece of shit with you

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

If ""Happy Ever Afters"" did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick

I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I was in the dark
I was falling hard
With an open heart (I'm wide awake)
How did I read the stars so wrong? (I'm wide awake)
And now it’s clear to me
That everything you see
Ain’t always what it seems (I'm wide awake)
Yeah, I was dreaming for so long

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I knew then, what I know now
Wouldn’t dive in, wouldn’t bow down
Gravity hurts, you made it so sweet
‘Til I woke up on, on the concrete

[Chorus]
Falling from cloud nine
Crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight
Yeah, I'm falling from cloud nine

[Verse 2]
I'm wide awake
Not losing any sleep
I picked up every piece
And landed on my feet (I'm wide awake)
Need nothing to complete myself, no (I'm wide awake)
Yeah, I am born again
Out of the lion's den
I don't have to pretend (And it's too late)
The story's over now, the end

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I knew then, what I know now
Wouldn't dive in, wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts, you made it so sweet
'Til I woke up on, on the concrete

[Chorus]
Falling from cloud nine (It was out of the blue, I'm)
Crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight (Yeah, I'm letting you go, I'm)
I'm falling from cloud nine (I'm wide awake)

[Bridge]
Thunder rumbling
Castles crumbling (I'm wide awake)
I am trying to hold on (I'm wide awake)
God knows that I tried
Seeing the bright side (I'm wide awake)
But I'm not blind anymore

[Interlude]
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm falling from cloud nine (It was out of the blue, I'm)
Crashing from the high
You know, I'm letting go tonight (Yeah, I'm letting you go, I'm)
I'm falling from cloud nine

Right now, right now, right now, right now, right now
Catch me in the club like I own that bitch
Shawty dancin' like she on that dick
Bad bitches never hold back
Send me a picture, where your phone at?

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I only came here for two reasons
I came for, whatchu came for?
I only came for the bitches and the drinks
Bitches and the drinks, bitches and the drinks
For the bitch, ca-came for the bitches and the drinks
Bitches and the drinks, bitches and the drinks, what you came for?
Baby, get your glass up, only came for bitches and the drinks
Baby, get your ass up, that's what I came for

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
I see you tryin' to handcuff her on the street
Stop trippin', you can't control that freak
Ain't nobody got a body like hers

Got a dark skinned girl dancin' on me
Two white girls dancin' on me
Bad yellow bone, yeah I'm in my zone
Waitress keep comin' back, so you know we hella gone

[Verse 3: T.I.]
I hit the club and buy the bar
In VIP, just see my partners and a lot of broads
And such a G' I be, just pop them bottles, party hard
I'm done with today, I'm lookin' for tomorrow
All I do is turn up, ain’t no dough it don’t concern us
All this bubba kush I burn up, smell some regular, it ruined us
Turning corners, fishtailin' out the parking lot yellin'
Bankhead, west side, eight or nine chicks trailin'
Right behind us, been this way since we were minors
If it wasn't for the chicks up in this bitch, you wouldn't find us
Even way out in China, same thing when I came through the door
Like, here you go again, where the bitches and the drink, yo

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I only came for
I only came for the bitches and the drinks
Bitches and the drinks, bitches and the drinks
You need to know what I came for
Bitches and the drinks
Bitches and the drinks, bitches and the drinks
I know you know what I came for
Baby, get your glass up, only came for bitches and the drinks
Baby, get your ass up, that's what I came for

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
Hey girl, you heard what I said, get your ass up
If you hot, you cold, you Florida, Alaska
Chicago, Virginia, New York City
Houston where the girls all thick
LA, the Bay, tell your girl 'bout this
Matter fact tell the whole GA
Ooh, you know they fine up and down the Carolinas
Shout to every ten I see when I'm down in Tennessee

Ah-ah
Ah-ah

[Verse 1]
I came here tonight to get you out of my mind
I'm gonna take what I find (Uh-oh, yeah!)
So open the box, don't need no key, I'm unlocked
And I won't tell you to stop (Uh-oh, yeah!)

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey boy! I don't need to know where you've been
All I need to know is you in, no need for talkin'
Hey boy! So don't even tell me your name
All I need to know is whose place
And let's get walkin'

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is love your body
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it
All I wanna do is love your body
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it

[Verse 2]
It's true what you heard, I am a freak, I'm disturbed
So come on and give me your worst (Uh-oh, yeah)
We're moving faster than slow
If you don't know where to go
I'll finish off on my own (Oh-oh, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey boy! I don't need to know where you've been
All I need to know is you in, no need for talkin'
Hey boy! So don't even tell me your name
All I need to know is whose place
And let's get walkin'
Say, say, hey

All I wanna do is love your body
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it
All I wanna do is love your body (Your body)

I think you already know my name
Hey, hey, ha! Alright, say

Baby, go get your hair did and buy you a couple purses, you just perfect

[Bridge: Brandy]
You, you, you, can be the one I call
When having a bad day and I need a shoulder to cry on
You, you, you, might change the way I feel
Teach me how to let the guard down (I'ma put it down, you gon' fall in love)
Ain't gon' lie, it's been tough
I thought someone one I had was the answer to my prayers
I'ma bow down, he wasn't the truth
And I got you, tryna tell me
If I let you put it (You gon' fall in love, I'ma put it down, you gon' fall in love)

130,130,Give Your Heart A Break,"[Verse 1]
The day I first met you, you told me
You'd never fall in love
But now that I get you, I know fear is what it really was

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now here we are
So close, yet so far
Haven't I passed the test?
When will you realize, baby, I'm not like the rest?

[Chorus 1]
Don't wanna break your heart
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared it's wrong
Like you might make a mistake
There's just one life to live
And there's no time to wait, to waste
So let me give your heart a break, give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
Oh yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
On Sunday, you went home, alone
There were tears in your eyes
I called your cell phone, my love, but you did not reply

[Pre-Chorus 2]
The world is ours if we want it
We can take it, if you just take my hand
There's no turning back now
Baby, try to understand

[Chorus 1]
Don't wanna break your heart
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared, it's wrong
Like you might make a mistake
There's just one life to live
And there's no time to wait, to waste
So let me give your heart a break, give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
There's just so much you can take
Give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
Oh yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
When your lips are on my lips
Then our hearts beat as one
But you slip out of my fingertips
Every time you run, whoa, whoa

[Chorus 1]
Don't wanna break your heart (Don't wanna break your heart)
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared, it's wrong
Like you might make a mistake (I know you're scared, it's wrong)
There's just one life to live
And there's no time to wait, to waste
So let me give your heart a break
(Let me give your heart a break)

[Chorus 2]
'Cause you've been hurt before
I can see it in your eyes
You try to smile it away
Some things you can't disguise
Don't wanna break your heart
Baby, I can ease the ache, the ache
So let me give your heart a break, give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break
There's just so much you can take
Give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break (Your heart)
Your heart a break (A break)
Oh yeah, yeah

131,131,I Can Only Imagine,"[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Where you been? Where you been all my life?
Baby, it's a sin, the way you looking alive
It's obvious that I want something from you
And you know what
What I wanna do, do, do

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
If we touched, it would bring me to life
I can only imagine, only imagine what it'd be like
Oh, every time, it will bring me to life
I can only imagine, only imagine
What it'd be like, what it'd be like
What it'd be like, like, like
What it'd be like, like, like, like, like, like

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Saw you, saw you, saw you from afar, thought I'd say, ""Wassup""
You can tell me your name, when we wakin' up
They, they call me Tunechi, I'm good, I'm Gucci
Now you can kiss your old dude goodbye, smooches
You're a beast, yo-you're a beauty
Man, I think somebody done gave Cupid a Uzi
Sh-Shoot me, you're a firework, brighter in the dark
So let's turn off the lights, and give me that spark

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
If we touched, it would bring me to life
I can only imagine, only imagine what it'd be like
Oh, every time, it will bring me to life
I can only imagine, only imagine
What it'd be like, what it'd be like
What it'd be like, like, like
What it'd be like, like, like, like, like, like

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
I want your love to touch me, one touch will feel free
(It would bring me to life)
I want to feel free, so I can finally be (If you kiss me)
So I can finally be, so I can finally be (Girl, give me now)
So I can finally see, so I can finally see (Give me now)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Saw you, saw you, saw you from afar, thought I'd say, ""Wassup""

132,132,Don't Rush,"[Verse 1: Kelly Clarkson]
Let's wake up in the afternoon
Pretend that we got nothing to do
No we don't have to go by any agenda
We can make up our own rules
I see the way you're looking at me
Baby, know I'm feeling it too
We can just light up every candle
Move from room to room

[Chorus: Kelly Clarkson & Vince Gill]
Stopping every minute just because you're in it
Wishing everyday was Sunday, you're right next to me
It's how it's supposed to be
Hanging on every touch
Baby, don't rush (No, no)
Baby, don't rush

[Verse 2: Kelly Clarkson]
Throw the map out the window
Taking the long way around
To a secret place where no one could find us
A little place we can call our own
Come over here and take a picture
Something we can hang on to
We can look back and try to remember
All the crazy things we're gonna do

Stopping every minute just because you're in it
Wishing everyday was Sunday, you're right next to me
It's how it's supposed to be (supposed to be)
Just hanging on every touch
Baby, don't rush
Baby, don't rush

[Bridge: Kelly Clarkson & Vince Gill]
Stopping every minute just because you're in it
Stopping every minute just because you're in it
Stopping every minute

It's how it's supposed to be
Stopping every minute just because you're in it

Just hanging on every touch

133,133,My Moment,"[Intro: DJ Drama]
You see I been waiting, waiting on that time
Feel me if you been waiting on yours
That moment... is close (Yeah!)

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Tired of living day to day like everything is alright...
Just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, 2 Chainz!
Old dude met mom it was on
Then he named me over a phone, prison term
Live and learn, sippin' syrup with my vision blurred
Take this cup of reality, niggas finna err
When you start from the bottom you can see the top
So when you get to it, don't let 'em see the spot
Next thing you know you lookin' for a rent sign
Upper echelon, bitch we skip line
I remember reminiscing in the kitchen like
I wonder when the Braves gon' win it
I wonder when the Falcons gon' get here; pyrex vison
Made more than I ever made with DTP this year

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Tired of livin' day to day like everything is alright
Livin like there's one thing on my mind
Just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment
You say you got that oh shit? Hell nah - next time that's mine
Long as I stay hustling I'm gon' shine
Just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Waitin' on my moment...
Just waiting on my moment; bad hoes I'm shonin
Time came and I owned it just like Lebron James and start ballin
When I touched the rock I cracked the block, when I pulled up in that muscle drop
With that roof off and my shoes off on you bitch niggas, RuPaul
Real nigga in my hood, who everybody gon' root for
Cause they see me come from that bottom where everybody get bodied
They told me get em, I got em, now I'm here nigga like yeah nigga
Just Rolls Royce and Bugattis and M4's this year nigga
If I don't grind, I don't shine, if I don't shine, then I don't eat
Won't eat, then I'mma starve, if I'mma starve, I pull heat
On all y'all bitch ass niggas, all y'all rich ass niggas
Cause if I dont make no money nigga, I'm gon' take yo money nigga

[Chorus: Jeremih]
[Tired of livin' day to day like everything is alright
Livin like there's one thing on my mind
Just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment]
[You say you got that oh shit? Hell nah - next time that's mine]
[Long as I stay hustling I'm gon' shine]
[Just waiting on that moment
Waiting on my moment]

[Bridge: Jeremih]
Since life ain't promised tomorrow
Live it up! Live it up! Live it up!
Here before it come this far
Give it up! Give it up! Give it up!
I won't - Give it up! Give it up! Give it up!
Until I have it all, yeah!

[Chorus: Jeremih]
[Tired of livin' day to day like everything is alright
Livin like there's one thing on my mind

134,134,I Won't Give Up,"[Verse 1]
When I look into your eyes
It's like watching the night sky
Or a beautiful sunrise
Well, there's so much they hold
And just like them old stars
I see that you've come so far
To be right where you are
How old is your soul?

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And when you're needing your space
To do some navigating
I'll be here patiently waiting
To see what you find

[Chorus]
'Cause even the stars, they burn
Some even fall to the earth
We've got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it
No, I won't give up

[Bridge]
I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
Our differences, they do a lot to teach us how to use the tools and gifts
We got yeah, we got a lot at stake
And in the end, you're still my friend, at least we did intend
For us to work, we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn, how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I got, and what I'm not
And who I am

[Chorus 2]
I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up
I'm still looking up

[Chorus 3]
Well, I won't give up on us
God knows I'm tough enough
We got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it (And we're worth it)

[Outro]
I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up","['when', 'i', 'look', 'into', 'your', 'eye', 'its', 'like', 'watch', 'the', 'night', 'sky', 'or', 'a', 'beautiful', 'sunrise', 'well', 'theres', 'so', 'much', 'they', 'hold', 'and', 'just', 'like', 'them', 'old', 'star', 'i', 'see', 'that', 'youve', 'come', 'so', 'far', 'to', 'be', 'right', 'where', 'you', 'be', 'how', 'old', 'be', 'your', 'soul', 'well', 'i', 'wont', 'give', 'up', 'on', 'us', 'even', 'if', 'the', 'sky', 'get', 'rough', 'im', 'give', 'you', 'all', 'my', 'love', 'im', 'still', 'look', 'up', 'and', 'when', 'youre', 'need', 'your', 'space', 'to', 'do', 'some', 'navigate', 'ill', 'be', 'here', 'patiently', 'wait', 'to', 'see', 'what', 'you', 'find', 'cause', 'even', 'the', 'star', 'they', 'burn', 'some', 'even', 'fall', 'to', 'the', 'earth', 'weve', 'get', 'a', 'lot', 'to', 'learn', 'god', 'know', 'be', 'worth', 'it', 'no', 'i', 'wont', 'give', 'up', 'i', 'dont', 'wanna', 'be', 'someone', 'who', 'walk', 'away', 'so', 'easily', 'im', 'here', 'to', 'stay', 'and', 'make', 'the', 'difference', 'that', 'i', 'can', 'make', 'our', 'differences', 'they', 'do', 'a', 'lot', 'to', 'teach', 'us', 'how', 'to', 'use', 'the', 'tool', 'and', 'gift', 'we', 'get', 'yeah', 'we', 'get', 'a', 'lot', 'at', 'stake', 'and', 'in', 'the', 'end', 'youre', 'still', 'my', 'friend', 'at', 'least', 'we', 'do', 'intend', 'for', 'us', 'to', 'work', 'we', 'didnt', 'break', 'we', 'didnt', 'burn', 'we', 'have', 'to', 'learn', 'how', 'to', 'bend', 'without', 'the', 'world', 'cave', 'in', 'i', 'have', 'to', 'learn', 'what', 'i', 'get', 'and', 'what', 'im', 'not', 'and', 'who', 'i', 'be', 'i', 'wont', 'give', 'up', 'on', 'us', 'even', 'if', 'the', 'sky', 'get', 'rough', 'im', 'give', 'you', 'all', 'my', 'love', 'im', 'still', 'look', 'up', 'im', 'still', 'look', 'up', 'well', 'i', 'wont', 'give', 'up', 'on', 'us', 'god', 'know', 'im', 'tough', 'enough', 'we', 'get', 'a', 'lot', 'to', 'learn', 'i', 'wont', 'give', 'up', 'on', 'us', 'even', 'if', 'the', 'sky', 'get', 'rough', 'im', 'give', 'you', 'all', 'my', 'love', 'im', 'still', 'look', 'up']",280,Jason Mraz,Jason Mraz,2012,"[43, 49, 44, 42, 35, 32, 25, 26, 25, 22, 25, 25, 27, 27, 23, 24, 24, 24, 23, 23, 25, 26, 28, 30, 29, 34, 40, 33, 36, 49, 57, 53, 55, 51, 51, 52, 64, 59, 71, 81, 78, 72, 22, 8]",44,I Won't Give Up (Jason Mraz Remake),https://open.spotify.com/track/4ISmDGI64oe72bF7wOVCpm,4ISmDGI64oe72bF7wOVCpm,spotify:track:4ISmDGI64oe72bF7wOVCpm,I Won't Give Up (Jason Mraz Remake),39lfjORV8NPg4ZJqg0vIGZ,spotify:album:39lfjORV8NPg4ZJqg0vIGZ,Jay Gives,5hfqoOFItYT0OSyzjCA6Ma,spotify:artist:5hfqoOFItYT0OSyzjCA6Ma,241.78900000000002,1.0,17.0,2012-01-03,0.506,0.295,4.0,-9.749,1.0,0.0275,0.34700000000000003,0.0,0.122,0.239,136.496,[],[],1.0

They say life is a battlefield
I say bring it on
If you wanna know how I feel
Leave it till it's gone
I'm just saying that what don't kill
Only makes you strong
If you don't recognize what is real
Then forever is a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long time

[Pre-Chorus]
Some things never change, here we go again
Feel like I'm losing my mind
Shake it off, let it go, I don't care anymore

[Chorus]
Let's go numb
You never know until you let go
Let's go numb
I can feel you now

[Verse 2]
Keep on doing the same old thing
And you expecting change
Well, is that really insanity
Or just a loser's game?
I only trust in the things I feel
Some may say that's strange
You better recognize what is real
'Cause forever is a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long time

[Pre-Chorus]
Some things never change, here we go again
Feel like I'm losing my mind
Shake it off, let it go, I don't care anymore

Let's go numb
You never know until you let go
We all go numb
I can feel you now (numb)

137,137,Red,"[Verse 1]
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati
Down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
Ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind
Once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright
Just before they lose it all

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red

[Verse 2]
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
Was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing
All the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
And realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out
That love could be that strong

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Oh, red
Burning red

[Bridge]
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Loving him was red

[Chorus]
Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
Yeah, yeah, red
We're burning red

[Breakdown]
And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red
Yeah, yeah

Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, making me feel like

And your eyes look like coming home

Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran + Taylor Swift]
And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
And I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time
Taking flight, making me feel right

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift + Ed Sheeran]
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift + Ed Sheeran]
'Cause all I know is we said, ""Hello""
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

[Bridge: Taylor Swift + Ed Sheeran]
Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift + Ed Sheeran]
'Cause all I know is we said, ""Hello""
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

[Outro: Taylor Swift]
All I know is we said, ""Hello""
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days, I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed","['all', 'i', 'know', 'this', 'morning', 'when', 'i', 'wake', 'be', 'i', 'know', 'something', 'now', 'know', 'something', 'now', 'i', 'didnt', 'before', 'and', 'all', 'ive', 'see', 'since', '18', 'hours', 'ago', 'be', 'green', 'eye', 'and', 'freckle', 'and', 'your', 'smile', 'in', 'the', 'back', 'of', 'my', 'mind', 'make', 'me', 'feel', 'like', 'i', 'just', 'wanna', 'know', 'you', 'better', 'know', 'you', 'better', 'know', 'you', 'better', 'now', 'i', 'just', 'wanna', 'know', 'you', 'better', 'know', 'you', 'better', 'know', 'you', 'better', 'now', 'i', 'just', 'wanna', 'know', 'you', 'better', 'know', 'you', 'better', 'know', 'you', 'better', 'now', 'i', 'just', 'wanna', 'know', 'you', 'know', 'you', 'know', 'you', 'cause', 'all', 'i', 'know', 'be', 'we', 'say', 'hello', 'and', 'your', 'eye', 'look', 'like', 'come', 'home', 'all', 'i', 'know', 'be', 'a', 'simple', 'name', 'everything', 'have', 'change', 'all', 'i', 'know', 'be', 'you', 'hold', 'the', 'door', 'youll', 'be', 'mine', 'and', 'ill', 'be', 'yours', 'all', 'i', 'know', 'since', 'yesterday', 'be', 'everything', 'have', 'change', 'and', 'all', 'my', 'wall', 'stand', 'tall', 'paint', 'blue', 'and', 'ill', 'take', 'em', 'down', 'take', 'em', 'down', 'and', 'open', 'up', 'the', 'door', 'for', 'you', 'and', 'all', 'i', 'feel', 'in', 'my', 'stomach', 'be', 'butterfly', 'the', 'beautiful', 'kind', 'make', 'up', 'for', 'lose', 'time', 'take', 'flight', 'make', 'me', 'feel', 'right', 'i', 'just', 'wanna', 'know', 'you', 'better', 'know', 'you', 'better', 'know', 'you', 'better', 'now', 'i', 'just', 'wanna', 'know', 'you', 'better', 'know', 'you', 'better', 'know', 'you', 'better', 'now', 'i', 'just', 'wanna', 'know', 'you', 'better', 'know', 'you', 'better', 'know', 'you', 'better', 'now', 'i', 'just', 'wanna', 'know', 'you', 'know', 'you', 'know', 'you', 'cause', 'all', 'i', 'know', 'be', 'we', 'say', 'hello', 'and', 'your', 'eye', 'look', 'like', 'come', 'home', 'all', 'i', 'know', 'be', 'a', 'simple', 'name', 'everything', 'have', 'change', 'all', 'i', 'know', 'be', 'you', 'hold', 'the', 'door', 'youll', 'be', 'mine', 'and', 'ill', 'be', 'yours', 'all', 'i', 'know', 'since', 'yesterday', 'be', 'everything', 'have', 'change', 'come', 'back', 'and', 'tell', 'me', 'why', 'im', 'feel', 'like', 'ive', 'miss', 'you', 'all', 'this', 'time', 'and', 'meet', 'me', 'there', 'tonight', 'and', 'let', 'me', 'know', 'that', 'its', 'not', 'all', 'in', 'my', 'mind', 'i', 'just', 'wanna', 'know', 'you', 'better', 'know', 'you', 'better', 'know', 'you', 'better', 'now', 'i', 'just', 'wanna', 'know', 'you', 'know', 'you', 'know', 'you', 'cause', 'all', 'i', 'know', 'be', 'we', 'say', 'hello', 'and', 'your', 'eye', 'look', 'like', 'come', 'home', 'all', 'i', 'know', 'be', 'a', 'simple', 'name', 'everything', 'have', 'change', 'all', 'i', 'know', 'be', 'you', 'hold', 'the', 'door', 'youll', 'be', 'mine', 'and', 'ill', 'be', 'yours', 'all', 'i', 'know', 'since', 'yesterday', 'be', 'everything', 'have', 'change', 'all', 'i', 'know', 'be', 'we', 'say', 'hello', 'so', 'dust', 'off', 'your', 'highest', 'hop', 'all', 'i', 'know', 'be', 'pour', 'rain', 'and', 'everything', 'have', 'change', 'all', 'i', 'know', 'be', 'a', 'new', 'find', 'grace', 'all', 'my', 'days', 'ill', 'know', 'your', 'face', 'all', 'i', 'know', 'since', 'yesterday', 'be', 'everything', 'have', 'change']",434,Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift Featuring Ed Sheeran,2012,[67],1,Everything Has Changed (Originally Performed by Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran) [Karaoke Version],https://open.spotify.com/track/20AGlD7Dnu3c6bbqNJLJeo,20AGlD7Dnu3c6bbqNJLJeo,spotify:track:20AGlD7Dnu3c6bbqNJLJeo,"Karaoke 2015: The Ultimate New Year's Party Hit Mix Featuring Backing Tracks to Hits by Miley Cyrus, London Grammar, Lana Del Rey, Britney Spears, & More!",5xMeOEUlKlYePdOaLzjICu,spotify:album:5xMeOEUlKlYePdOaLzjICu,Pop Voice Nation,1fAfuhIzpl0ZSaCxJ62J60,spotify:artist:1fAfuhIzpl0ZSaCxJ62J60,243.252,32.0,0.0,2014-11-17,0.654,0.258,6.0,-12.713,1.0,0.0718,0.0549,0.757,0.0934,0.0675,79.994,[],[],1.0

Uh!

[Verse 1]
Hey, boy, you never had much game

Now, I see you've been hanging out
With that other girl in town
Looking like a pair of clowns, clowns, clowns (Uh!)

Want, want you, want you back (Uh!)

[Verse 2]
Please, this ain't even jealousy
She ain't got a thing on me
Tryna rock them ugly, jeans, jeans, jeans (Uh!)

If what I've been told is true (Is it true?)
You'll be crawling back like, boo-hoo-hoo (Uh!)

143,143,All Too Well,"[Intro]
I walked through the door with you
The air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow, and I
Left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it
In your drawer, even now

[Verse 1]
Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus 1]
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well

[Verse 2]
Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team
You told me about your past, thinking your future was me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

[Chorus 2]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
Maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well

[Verse 3]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf
From that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
And it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus 3]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

[Outro]
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well","['i', 'walk', 'through', 'the', 'door', 'with', 'you', 'the', 'air', 'be', 'cold', 'but', 'something', 'bout', 'it', 'felt', 'like', 'home', 'somehow', 'and', 'i', 'leave', 'my', 'scarf', 'there', 'at', 'your', 'sisters', 'house', 'and', 'youve', 'still', 'get', 'it', 'in', 'your', 'drawer', 'even', 'now', 'oh', 'your', 'sweet', 'disposition', 'and', 'my', 'wideeyed', 'gaze', 'be', 'sing', 'in', 'the', 'car', 'get', 'lose', 'upstate', 'autumn', 'leave', 'fall', 'down', 'like', 'piece', 'into', 'place', 'and', 'i', 'can', 'picture', 'it', 'after', 'all', 'these', 'days', 'and', 'i', 'know', 'its', 'long', 'go', 'and', 'that', 'magics', 'not', 'here', 'no', 'more', 'and', 'i', 'might', 'be', 'okay', 'but', 'im', 'not', 'fine', 'at', 'all', 'oh', 'oh', 'oh', 'cause', 'there', 'we', 'be', 'again', 'on', 'that', 'little', 'town', 'street', 'you', 'almost', 'run', 'the', 'red', 'cause', 'you', 'be', 'look', 'over', 'at', 'me', 'wind', 'in', 'my', 'hair', 'i', 'be', 'there', 'i', 'remember', 'it', 'all', 'too', 'well', 'photo', 'album', 'on', 'the', 'counter', 'your', 'cheek', 'be', 'turn', 'red', 'you', 'use', 'to', 'be', 'a', 'little', 'kid', 'with', 'glass', 'in', 'a', 'twinsized', 'bed', 'and', 'your', 'mother', 'tell', 'stories', 'bout', 'you', 'on', 'the', 'tee', 'ball', 'team', 'you', 'tell', 'me', 'about', 'your', 'past', 'think', 'your', 'future', 'be', 'me', 'and', 'i', 'know', 'its', 'long', 'go', 'and', 'there', 'be', 'nothing', 'else', 'i', 'could', 'do', 'and', 'i', 'forget', 'about', 'you', 'long', 'enough', 'to', 'forget', 'why', 'i', 'need', 'to', 'cause', 'there', 'we', 'be', 'again', 'in', 'the', 'middle', 'of', 'the', 'night', 'be', 'dance', 'round', 'the', 'kitchen', 'in', 'the', 'refrigerator', 'light', 'down', 'the', 'stairs', 'i', 'be', 'there', 'i', 'remember', 'it', 'all', 'too', 'well', 'yeah', 'maybe', 'we', 'get', 'lose', 'in', 'translation', 'maybe', 'i', 'ask', 'for', 'too', 'much', 'but', 'maybe', 'this', 'thing', 'be', 'a', 'masterpiece', 'til', 'you', 'tear', 'it', 'all', 'up', 'run', 'scar', 'i', 'be', 'there', 'i', 'remember', 'it', 'all', 'too', 'well', 'and', 'you', 'call', 'me', 'up', 'again', 'just', 'to', 'break', 'me', 'like', 'a', 'promise', 'so', 'casually', 'cruel', 'in', 'the', 'name', 'of', 'be', 'honest', 'im', 'a', 'crumple', 'up', 'piece', 'of', 'paper', 'lie', 'here', 'cause', 'i', 'remember', 'it', 'all', 'all', 'all', 'too', 'well', 'time', 'wont', 'fly', 'its', 'like', 'im', 'paralyze', 'by', 'it', 'id', 'like', 'to', 'be', 'my', 'old', 'self', 'again', 'but', 'im', 'still', 'try', 'to', 'find', 'it', 'after', 'plaid', 'shirt', 'days', 'and', 'nights', 'when', 'you', 'make', 'me', 'your', 'own', 'now', 'you', 'mail', 'back', 'my', 'things', 'and', 'i', 'walk', 'home', 'alone', 'but', 'you', 'keep', 'my', 'old', 'scarf', 'from', 'that', 'very', 'first', 'week', 'cause', 'it', 'remind', 'you', 'of', 'innocence', 'and', 'it', 'smell', 'like', 'me', 'you', 'cant', 'get', 'rid', 'of', 'it', 'cause', 'you', 'remember', 'it', 'all', 'too', 'well', 'yeah', 'cause', 'there', 'we', 'be', 'again', 'when', 'i', 'love', 'you', 'so', 'back', 'before', 'you', 'lose', 'the', 'one', 'real', 'thing', 'youve', 'ever', 'know', 'it', 'be', 'rare', 'i', 'be', 'there', 'i', 'remember', 'it', 'all', 'too', 'well', 'wind', 'in', 'my', 'hair', 'you', 'be', 'there', 'you', 'remember', 'it', 'all', 'down', 'the', 'stairs', 'you', 'be', 'there', 'you', 'remember', 'it', 'all', 'it', 'be', 'rare', 'i', 'be', 'there', 'i', 'remember', 'it', 'all', 'too', 'well']",465,Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,2012,[80],1,All Too Well,https://open.spotify.com/track/1q3RiD1tIWUpGsNFADMlvl,1q3RiD1tIWUpGsNFADMlvl,spotify:track:1q3RiD1tIWUpGsNFADMlvl,Red (Deluxe Edition),1KlU96Hw9nlvqpBPlSqcTV,spotify:album:1KlU96Hw9nlvqpBPlSqcTV,Taylor Swift,06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02,spotify:artist:06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02,327.89300000000003,22.0,62.0,2012-10-22,0.602,0.609,0.0,-7.803,1.0,0.0243,0.0382,0.0002,0.127,0.337,93.06,"['dance pop', 'pop', 'post-teen pop']",[],1.0
144,144,Stay Stay Stay,"[Verse 1]
I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room, at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning, I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said, ""Okay, let's talk""
And I said

[Hook]
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

[Verse 2]
Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me
No choice but to

[Hook]
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay

[Bridge]
You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes, and dreams
I just like hanging out with you, all the time
All those times that you didn't leave, it's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you, for my whole life

[Breakdown]
Stay, and I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay!

[Hook]
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay!

[Outro]
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time

145,145,Fade Into You,"If you were the ocean and I was the sun
If the day made me heavy and gravity won
If I was the red and you were the blue
I could just fade into you
If you were a window and I was the rain
I’d pour myself out and wash off the pain
I’d fall like a tear so your light could shine through
Then I’d just fade into you

In your heart in your head in your
Arms in your bed under your skin

Til there’s no way to know where
You end and where I begin

If I was a shadow and you were a
Street

The cobblestone midnight is where
We first meet

Til the lights flickered out, we
Dance with the moon

Then I’d just fade into you

In your heart in your head in your
Arms in your bed under your skin

Til there’s no way to know where
You end and where I begin

I wanna melt in I wanna soak through
I only wanna move when you move

I wanna breathe out when you
Breathe in then I wanna fade into you

If I was just ashes and you were
The ground

And under your willow they laid me
Down

There’ll be no trace that one was
Once two

After I fade into you

(Ooooh)

Then I’d just fade into you
Then I'd just fade into you
Then I'd just fade into you
Then I'd just fade into you","['if', 'you', 'be', 'the', 'ocean', 'and', 'i', 'be', 'the', 'sun', 'if', 'the', 'day', 'make', 'me', 'heavy', 'and', 'gravity', 'win', 'if', 'i', 'be', 'the', 'red', 'and', 'you', 'be', 'the', 'blue', 'i', 'could', 'just', 'fade', 'into', 'you', 'if', 'you', 'be', 'a', 'window', 'and', 'i', 'be', 'the', 'rain', 'i’d', 'pour', 'myself', 'out', 'and', 'wash', 'off', 'the', 'pain', 'i’d', 'fall', 'like', 'a', 'tear', 'so', 'your', 'light', 'could', 'shine', 'through', 'then', 'i’d', 'just', 'fade', 'into', 'you', 'in', 'your', 'heart', 'in', 'your', 'head', 'in', 'your', 'arm', 'in', 'your', 'bed', 'under', 'your', 'skin', 'til', 'there’s', 'no', 'way', 'to', 'know', 'where', 'you', 'end', 'and', 'where', 'i', 'begin', 'if', 'i', 'be', 'a', 'shadow', 'and', 'you', 'be', 'a', 'street', 'the', 'cobblestone', 'midnight', 'be', 'where', 'we', 'first', 'meet', 'til', 'the', 'light', 'flicker', 'out', 'we', 'dance', 'with', 'the', 'moon', 'then', 'i’d', 'just', 'fade', 'into', 'you', 'in', 'your', 'heart', 'in', 'your', 'head', 'in', 'your', 'arm', 'in', 'your', 'bed', 'under', 'your', 'skin', 'til', 'there’s', 'no', 'way', 'to', 'know', 'where', 'you', 'end', 'and', 'where', 'i', 'begin', 'i', 'wanna', 'melt', 'in', 'i', 'wanna', 'soak', 'through', 'i', 'only', 'wanna', 'move', 'when', 'you', 'move', 'i', 'wanna', 'breathe', 'out', 'when', 'you', 'breathe', 'in', 'then', 'i', 'wanna', 'fade', 'into', 'you', 'if', 'i', 'be', 'just', 'ash', 'and', 'you', 'be', 'the', 'grind', 'and', 'under', 'your', 'willow', 'they', 'lay', 'me', 'down', 'there’ll', 'be', 'no', 'trace', 'that', 'one', 'be', 'once', 'two', 'after', 'i', 'fade', 'into', 'you', 'then', 'i’d', 'just', 'fade', 'into', 'you', 'then', 'id', 'just', 'fade', 'into', 'you', 'then', 'id', 'just', 'fade', 'into', 'you', 'then', 'id', 'just', 'fade', 'into', 'you']",246,Sam Palladio & Clare Bowen,Sam Palladio & Clare Bowen,2012,[92],1,Fade into You (In the Sam Palladio and Clare Bowen) [Karaoke Version],https://open.spotify.com/track/5Zu8J64qymemyGRqYCG0EY,5Zu8J64qymemyGRqYCG0EY,spotify:track:5Zu8J64qymemyGRqYCG0EY,Fade into You (In the Sam Palladio and Clare Bowen) [Karaoke Version] - Single,28agQveFpyStTzw9JodY5n,spotify:album:28agQveFpyStTzw9JodY5n,Ameritz Karaoke Entertainment,6A0fDIT1PphHIsNz4KfIK0,spotify:artist:6A0fDIT1PphHIsNz4KfIK0,191.735,1.0,0.0,2013-04-03,0.685,0.384,9.0,-12.918,1.0,0.0457,0.779,0.888,0.318,0.17800000000000002,115.94200000000001,['karaoke'],[],1.0

[Bridge]
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street I hear

[ScHoolBoy Q]
""YAWK! YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!""

[Hook]
""Man down, where you from, nigga?""
""Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?""
""Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?""
""This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga""

[Verse 1]
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slinging crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighing on your brain
It was me, L Boogs and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, waving your hand out the window, check yourself, uh
Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder saying that he did it
But ever since that day, I was looking at him different
That was back when I was nine,Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time, with the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shooting for if you ain't walking up, you fucking punk?
Picking up the fucking pump, picking off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch, a wall of bullets coming from
AK's, AR's, ""Aye y'all, duck""
That's what momma said when we was eating the free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck your truce
Now crawl your head in that noose, you wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces BG's up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be calling your mother collect
They say the governor collect, all of our taxes except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You moving backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess, m.A.A.d city

[Intro: MC Eiht]
Wake your punk ass up! It ain't nothing but a Compton thang, G-yeah. Real simple and plain, I'mma teach you some lessons about the street. Hood. It ain't nothing but a Compton thang, G-yeah. How we do

[Verse 2]
Fresh outta school cause I was a high school grad
Sleeping in the living room in my momma's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My Pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month, and ended up leaving
In fact, I got fired
Cause I was inspired
By all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up
Gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth
I was straight tweaking
The next weekend
We broke even
I made allegiance
That made a promise to see you bleeding
You know the reasons
But still won't ever know my life
Kendrick, A.K.A. ""Compton's human sacrifice""

[Interlude: MC Eiht]
G-yeah, cocaine, weed. Niggas been mixing shit since the 80's, loc. Sherm sticks, butt nakeds. Dip, make a nigga flip. Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit. One time's crooked and shit. Block a nigga in. Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton

[Verse 3: MC Eiht]
I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah, that's cool
The hood took me under so I follow the rules
But yeah that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doing the same thing
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-by's in the hood lately
Couple of I.V.s with the fucking spraycan
Shots in the crowd then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip
Trip, we in the hood still
So loc, grab a strap cause yeah, it's so real
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and 10 grands where a mothafucka stand

[Verse 4]
If I told you I killed a nigga at 16, would you believe me?
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor, instead of boy with a chopper
That hold the cul-de-sac hostage, kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizing
The option of living a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinking and drive, hit the powder then watch this flame
That arrive in his eye, listen coward, the concept is aim
And they bang it and slide out that bitch with deposits
A price on his head, the tithes probably go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the rough
Compton, U.S.A. made Me an Angel on Angel Dust, what

And my ears hear the call of my unborn sons
And I know their choices color all I’ve done
But I’ll explain it all to the watchman’s son
I never lived a year better spent in love

[Hook]
'Cause I know my weakness know my voice
And I believe in grace and choice
And I know perhaps my heart is farce
But I’ll be born without a mask

(Woo!)

[Verse 2]
Like the city that nurtured my greed and my pride
I stretch my arms into the sky
I cry Babel! Babel! Look at me now
Then the walls of my town, they come crumbling down
You ask where will we stand in the winds that will howl
As all we see will slip into the cloud
So come down from your mountain and stand where we’ve been
You know our breath is weak and our body thin

[Bridge]
Press my nose up to the glass around your heart
I should’ve known I was weaker from the start
You’ll build your walls and I will play my bloody part
To tear, tear them down
Well, I’m gonna tear, tear them down

[Hook]
'Cause I know my weakness know my voice
And I believe in grace and choice
And I know perhaps my heart is farce

148,148,State Of Grace,"[Verse 1]
I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know, is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds, or fades in time

[Chorus]
And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same

[Verse 2]
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannon ball
Now all we know, is don’t let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

[Chorus]
And I never (never) saw you coming
And I’ll never (never) be the same

[Bridge]
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You’re my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good
And right and real

[Breakdown]
And I never (never) saw you coming
And I’ll never (never) be the same

[Chorus]
And I never (never) saw you coming
And I’ll never
(So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong)
Be the same

But this love is brave and wild)

Untie all the cables and rope
Step onto the astro turf
Get yourself a coozie

Floating is all I want to do
You can climb the ladder
Just don't rock the boat while I barbeque

Jumping out the back, don't act like you don't want to

(You'll never let her go, why don't you let her go?)

[Verse 3]
Every now and then, she makes you just a little bit crazy (crazy)
She’ll turn a knife into your back and then she’s calling you baby, crazy

[Pre-Hook 2]
She'll make you take her to the club, but then she leaves with her friends
She likes to stay late at the party, cause the fun never ends
And all her clothes are on the floor and all your records are scratched
She's like a one-way ticket cause you can't come back

[Hook]
Saying yeah... you want her, but she's so mean
(You’ll never let her go, why don’t you let her go?)
Yeah... you want her, but she's so mean
(You'll never let her go, why don't you let her go?)

[Outro]
Yeah man, I know how you want her (how you want her)
Yeah man, I know how you want her (how you want her)
Yeah man, I know how you want her
But she's so mean

Too nice, too clean, too white, too green
Little haters, big dreams
I don't care what you think about me
Two faced old friends told me the end was near
Ha! Forget them, see, a lot of things changed since then
Don't they know that I came from Nebraska?
Am I gonna quit? Nice of you to ask, but
Momma told me go and chase what you after
I'm on track, so I'm gonna rap faster
I'm gonna break it down for you and get a little deeper
Slayin' on it, prayin' on it like a Grim Reaper
Running on thermometer, yup, I got a fever

Race track, two legs, Hollywood, big break
Suck it up, intake

Touchdown in the middle of the city
Mass Ave. street, jammed up to Newbury
Million dollar party, now, tell me who you wearing
Lots of new hand held hype you can carry
I'mma break it down for you and get a lil' deeper
Slayin' on it, prayin' on it like a grim reaper
Running on thermometer, and yep I got a fever

All the Benjamins you let me count
Wealth and health
For my family
And lettin' me ball on these niggas

Bottle after bottle, drink until I overdose
Pull up in the Phantom, watch them bitches catch the Holy Ghost
Errtime I step up in the dealer I be goin' broke
Shorty wanna fuck me, I say get on top and roller coast
And I lay back, she go cray, fuck me good, but she no stay
Murder on that pussy let her boyfriend get that DOA
Get it? And all I get is Frito Lay
Plus I'm on probation, when they test me I just pee Rosé
Cause last night, I went hard, Peach Ciroc, Patron and all
Thirty racks on magnum bottles, I think I was born to ball
Lookin' like a million plus, fresh I'm out that corner store
Hater I be doin' me, you guys should be doin' y'all
I'm stackin' money to the ceiling
All this ice that's in my Rollie I be chilling
And I just made a couple million
So I could take care of them children, let's go

Just bought my niggas some caine, so much it came with a plane
Bought my niggas some dope, so much it came with a boat
I just bought me a crib so big it came with a moat
For niggas jumping the fence I hope you niggas can float
And I just hope that I'm forgiven for carin' 'bout how they livin'
And loanin a little money and keepin' 'em out of prison
I ain't lyin' in my verses I'm just telling you the basics
Of growin' up with your friends and becomin the one that made it
Yes lord! All gold, man I got these bitches soul
Talking bout these other rappers getting old is even getting old
Worrying about your followers, you need to get your dollars up
Me and Meek, young niggas poppin' like our collars up
And good ain't good enough, and your hood ain't hood enough
Spent my whole life puttin on, you spend your whole life puttin up
Ain't no telling when I go, so there ain't shit that I'ma wait for
I'm the type to say a prayer, then go get what I just prayed for

And she a devil in a dress but if she knock I let her in
And if she knock I let her in
I have her wet by 12 o' clock, then 3 o' clock she wet again
I'm screaming Oh Lord, that pussy good, that pussy good
I'm tryna hold on, I wish I could, you think I should
She got that million dollar body, shorty my Bugatti
And she said she got a man, we keep it secret Illuminati
(Got Patron on deck) And Ciroc all in my bottle

You hold your truth so purely
And swerve not through the minds of men
This lie is dead
This cup of yours tastes holy
But a brush with the devil can clear your mind
Strengthen your spine

[Chorus]
And fingers tap into what you were once
And I'm worried that I blew my only chance

[Verse 2]
Whispers in the dark
Steal a kiss and you'll break a heart
Pick up your clothes and curl your toes
Learn your lesson, lead me home
Spare my sins for the ark, I was too slow to depart
I'm a cad, but I'm not a fraud, I've set out to serve the Lord
And my heart was colder when you'd gone
And I lost my head but found the one that I loved
Under this sun!
Under this sun!

[Chorus]
And fingers tap into what you were once
And I'm worried that I blew my only chance
And fingers tap into what you were once
And I'm worried that I blew my only chance

Club-hoppin', tryna get me some, bad bitches wanna get me sprung
Early in the morning, I'm wakin', bakin', drinkin', contemplatin'
Ain't no such thing as Satan, evil is what you make it
Thank the Lord for that burning bush
That big body Benz I was born to push
On my way I'm burning kush, nigga don't be worried 'bout us
Neighbors knockin' on the door, asking can we turn it down
I say, ""Ain't no music on"", she said, ""No, that weed is loud""

I've been told that I'm amazing, make sure keep that fire blazin', we livin'

Let me tell you ‘bout my month y'all, in the shop and I had a ball
I had to ball for therapy, my shrink don’t think that helps at all
Whatever, that man ain’t wearing these leather pants
I diagnose my damn self, these damn pills ain’t working fam
I- In my spare time, punching walls, fucking up my hand
I know that shit sound super cray but if you had my life you’d understand
But, I can’t fold, some poor soul got it way worse
We’re all troubled, in a world in trouble
It’s scary to have a kid walk this Earth
I’m what you made God, fuck yes I’m so odd
Thinking 'bout all my old friends who weren’t my friends all along
Hm, when it rains it pours, whiskey bottles on the sinks and floors
Everyday to find sane’s a chore, amidst a dream with no exit doors

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I need smoke
I need to smoke
Who gon' hold me down now?

I wanna get high y'all

Need it need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all?

[Verse 1]
If I could
I would dare
Feed your dreams
And starve your fears
If I could
Light the world
We could sit
And watch it burn
We could fall asleep inside the glow

[Chorus]
So tell me what I got to do to win you over
You'll never have to wonder if you need another
You'll never have to wonder if I understand
And every time you reach for me you'll find a hand out
Oh

[Verse 2]
If I could
Take you in
Feeling you deep
Beneath my skin
Then I could
Slip away
With you as a poison in my veins
I don't want to fall asleep alone
And wake up knowing that I died without the one

[Chorus]
So tell me what I got to do to win you over
You'll never have to wonder if you need another
You'll never have to wonder if I understand
And every time you reach for me you'll find a hand out
Oh
So tell me what I got to do to win you over
You'll never have to wonder if you need another
You'll never have to wonder if I understand
And every time you reach for me you'll find a hand out
Oh

[Verse 1]
You saw my pain, washed out in the rain
And broken glass saw the blood run from my veins
But you saw no fault, no cracks in my heart
And you knelt beside my hope torn apart
But the ghosts that we knew will flicker from view
And we'll live a long life

[Chorus]
So give me hope in the darkness that I will see the light
Cause oh they gave me such a fright
But I will hold as long as you like (with all of my might)
Just promise me we'll be all right

[Verse 2]
So lead me back
Turn south from that place
And close my eyes to my recent disgrace
Cause you know my call
And we'll share my all
And our children come and they will hear me roar

[Chorus]
So give me hope in the darkness that I will see the light
Cause oh they gave me such a fright
But I will hold as long as you like (with all of my might)
Just promise me we'll be all right

[Bridge]
But hold me still
Bury my heart on the coals (next to yours)
And hold me still
Bury my heart next to yours (on the coals)

[Chorus]
So give me hope in the darkness that I will see the light
Cause oh they gave me such a fright
But I will hold with all of my might (as long as you like)

163,163,What Makes You Beautiful,"[Verse 1: Liam]
You're insecure, don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the door
Don't need makeup to cover up
Being the way that you are is enough

[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

[Chorus: All & Harry]
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh, oh, you don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, you don't know you're beautiful
That's what makes you beautiful

[Verse 2: Zayn]
So c-come on, you got it wrong
To prove I'm right, I put it in a song
I don't know why you're being shy
And turn away when I look into your eyes

[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

[Chorus: All & Harry & (Zayn)]
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else (Nobody else)
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh, oh, you don't know you're beautiful (Oh)

You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, you don't know you're beautiful
That's what makes you beautiful

[Chorus: All & Harry & (Zayn)]
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground (ground), it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful (Beautiful)
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately (Desperately)

Usher, baby
I hear you, yeah
Rock with me
Fuck with me

[Verse 1: Usher]
Hey girl, I'm debating if I should take you home
Should I take you home?
I don't mean to keep you waiting
But I just gotta know if you're ready

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
She say she wanna take her skirt off, be my guest
I decided to take my shirt off and show my chest
And we've been sipping on that Merlot
So you know what's next
Working intermissions, switching positions
We so explicit, oh...

[Chorus: Usher]
You've been saying all night long
That you couldn't wait to get me home alone
What you gon' do to me
Don't talk about it, be about it
Let me see, let me see, let me see
Girl, I can't wait to get you home
Talk a good game, mate, come on
Hollering 'bout what you gon' do to me
Quit talking 'bout it, be about it
Let me see, let me see, let me see

[Verse 2: Usher]
I'll be anticipating
What you would do to me
What you gon' do to me?
Sex education
Hands on when you're with me
Can you handle me?

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
She say she wanna take her skirt off, be my guest
I decided to take my shirt off and show my chest
And we've been sipping on that Merlot
So you know what's next
Working intermissions, switching positions
We so explicit, oh...

[Chorus: Usher]
You've been saying all night long
That you couldn't wait to get me home alone
What you gon' do to me
Don't talk about it, be about it
Let me see, let me see, let me see
Girl, I can't wait to get you home
Talk a good game, mate, come on
Hollering 'bout what you gon' do to me
Quit talking 'bout it, be about it
Let me see, let me see, let me see

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Got on all my ice, talking cash shit
Been balling all my life, Lamborghini's, fast whips
She down to ride and deserves a boss who down to provide
We run the streets, but on G5's, I'm talking fly
Boots and blue jeans, Cartier, newer rings
You with a big boy, so we do the big things
Had to valet park it, Chanel hoodie on
Looking like Trayvon Martin, George Zimmerman, I'm wanted
She on my wanted poster, Ciroc in my mimosa
I'm balling like LeBron, we shopping in Milan
The 458 Ferrari, I park it on the lawn
I let her meet my tongue, she blew up like a bomb
The sex is so explosive, her stuff is supersonic
She my new addiction, I swear, I'm through with chronic
Rozay and Usher Raymond, girl, we the hottest
Rocking the most ice, I said we the hottest

[Chorus: Usher]
You've been saying all night long
That you couldn't wait to get me home alone
What you gon' do to me
Don't talk about it, be about it
Let me see, let me see, let me see
I can't wait to get you home
Talk a good game, mate, come on

I may watch you go
There'll be no value in the strength
Of walls that I have grown
There'll be no comfort in the shade
Of the shadows thrown
But I'd be yours if you'd be mine

Stretch out my life
And pick the seams out
Take what you like
But close my ears and eyes
Watch me stumble over and over

I had done wrong
You built your tower
But call me home
And I will build a throne
And wash my eyes out never again

But love the one you hold
And I'll be your gold
To have and to hold
A lover of the light

Skin too tight
And eyes like marbles
You spin me high
So watch me as I glide
Before I tumble homeward, homeward

I know I've tried
I was not stable
Flawed by pride
I miss my sanguine eyes
So hold my hands up -- breathe in, breathe out

Woop, turn the lights on
Oh woah, oh woah

[Verse 1]
We share something so common, but still so rare
And I’m in awe, never been here before
So high, we’re still climbing, even here inside these walls
Breaking each others hearts and we don’t care 'cause we’re so

[Chorus]
In too deep, can’t think about giving it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It’s killing me, swear I never cried so much
'Cause I never knew love would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had
Oh woah, never knew love, oh woah
Would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had

[Verse 2]
All the times when I know I should be smiling
Seem to be the time that I frown the most
Can't believe that we're still surviving
'Cause I'm slowly breaking down even when I hold you close
And if I lose you, I'm afraid I would lose who
Who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around
Even though I fell way

In too deep, can’t think about giving it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It’s killing me, swear I never cried so much

Oh woah, never knew love, oh woah
Would hurt this fucking bad

And you wanna leave, but the love keeps us together
And if I lose you, I'm afraid I would lose who, who I gave my love to

Moving in for a hug
Like you don't know I'm coming unglued
Why you gotta, why you wanna
Make me keep wanting you

[Verse 2]
I wish you had on sunglasses to cover up those blue eyes
I wish you said something mean to make me glad that you said goodbye
Why can't you look off somewhere if you catch me staring at you?
Why can't you be cold like any old good ex would do?

[Chorus]
So why you wanna
Show up in a old t-shirt that I love?
Why you gotta tell me that I'm looking good?
Don't know what you were thinkin', you were doing
Moving in for a hug
Like you don't know I'm coming unglued
Why you gotta, why you wanna
Make me keep wanting you
Keep wanting you

[Bridge]
Why, why, why
Would you tell me that you call me up sometime?
Maybe we can get a drink and just catch up
Like that'd be enough
No, that ain't enough

[Chorus]
Why you gotta show up in a old t-shirt that I love?
Why you gotta tell me that I'm looking good?
Don't know what you were thinkin', you were doing
Moving in for a hug
Like you don't know I'm coming unglued
Why you gotta, why you wanna
Make me keep wanting you?

[Outro]
Why you gotta, why you wanna
Make me keep wanting you?
Why you gotta, why you wanna
Make me keep wanting you?

I turn the TV off, to turn it on again
Staring at the blades of the fan as it spins around
Counting every crack, the clock is wide awake
Talking to myself, anything to make a sound

{Chorus}
I told you I wouldn’t call, I told you I wouldn’t care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I don’t think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over

{Verse 2}
You can say we’re done the way you always do
It’s easier to lie to me than to yourself
Forget about your friends, you know they’re gonna say
We’re bad for each other, but we ain’t good for anyone else

{Chorus}
I told you I wouldn’t call, I told you I wouldn’t care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I don’t think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over

{Bridge}
We don’t have to miss each other, come over
We don’t have to fix each other, come over
We don’t have to say forever, come over
You don’t have to stay forever, come over

She likes whiskey with her water
She starts dancing when the stars come out
She ain’t your typical preacher’s daughter
She’ll leave you dreamin’, yeah there ain’t no doubt

[Chorus]
There’s a little bit of devil in her angel eyes
She’s a little bit of heaven with a wild side
Got a rebel heart a country mile wide
There’s a little bit of devil in her angel eyes
A little bit of devil in her angel eyes

[Verse 2]
Saturday night she’s rockin’ out by the bonfire
Flirting from that tail gate and crankin’ up the dial
Come Sunday mornin’ she’ll be singing with the choir
Drivin’ me crazy with that kiss me smile

She’s a little bit of heaven with a wild side

She’s got that something, that sexy innocence, she must be heaven sent

Oh-oh, no-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
There's a place that I know
It's not pretty there and few have ever gone
If I show it to you now
Will it make you run away?

[Verse 2]
Or will you stay? Even if it hurts
Even if I try to push you out, will you return?
And remind me who I really am
Please remind me who I really am

[Chorus]
Everybody's got a dark side
Do you love me? Can you love mine?
Nobody's a picture perfect
But we're worth it
You know that we're worth it
Will you love me?
Even with my dark side?

[Verse 3]
Like a diamond from black dust
It's hard to know what can become if you give up
So don't give up on me
Please remind me who I really am

Do you love me? Can you love mine?
Nobody's a picture perfect
But we're worth it
You know that we're worth it
Will you love me?

174,174,Enough Of No Love,"I admit that you almost had me
I admit I was almost crazy
Had me thinkin' 'bout callin' that bitch at night
And let her know where she can come and meet me
But it's cool, I'ma be a lady
She think she cute but she don't phase me
And if you knew about all of this good love you'll be missin' out on
You wouldn't have played me

Can't say I'm not hurt
I'll be damned if I'm broken
What we had is now hers
Let her know she can have it

Cause I-I can't stay here, if there's no love
Yeah I-I can't stay here, cause I've had enough
Enough of no love, enough of no love
No love!

And I admit that I thought about creeping
So you could get a dose of how I feel
Cause our hearts can never seem to break even
But what's the use I'd rather pack it up and leaving
Cause here we are again, cause you're wrong again
Quit tryin' to tell me that you love me
Cause your actions say another thing

Can't say I'm not hurt
I'll be damned if I'm broken
What we had is now hers
Let her know she can have it

Cause I-I can't stay here, if there's no love
I-I can't stay here, cause I've had enough
Enough of no love, enough of no love

Why you worry 'bout that other hoe
Cause that other hoe worry 'bout another hoe
Yeah, you say it's over but you still fussing
You just clumsy, always tripping over nothing
That other bitch is just that other bitch
I give her space and give you the mother ship
We can't let her tear down what we built
I told you if you ride or die then I'll be your seat-belt
In sickness and in health for rich poor and I stay rich
But love is a bitch and bitches ain't shit
And I'm riding with a girl name Keisha smoking on Kesha

Alright
Ain't this what you came for?
Don't you wish you came more?
Girl, what you playing for?
Ay, come on
Come on let me kiss that
Ooh, I know you miss that
What's wrong? Let me fix that
Twist that

[Hook: John Legend]
Baby, tonight's the night I let you know
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that
Tonight I'll be the best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had

[Verse 2: John Legend]
I hit you with the best stroke
Freestyle and then the breaststroke
Til you blowing cigarette smoke
And now the bed's broke
So what we gonna do now?
Fuck it, round two now
Work it out, then we cool down
Cool down

[Hook: John Legend]
Baby, tonight's the night I let you know
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that
Tonight I'll be the best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
(Give me a little bit of that light-skinned love)
The best you ever had

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Luda! Listen
You ain't even gotta text me
Knowing me and you got that mental telepathy
Me be up at the spot, I'll be sending over the chauffeur
Rich nigga, bread stay popping like a toaster
Nobody come close to me and you together
Step under my umbrella
We’ll make it through any weather
Except when I make it storm
Sex in the greatest form
And hibernate under my body
Yep, I keep it warmer than a chinchilla
She know I beat it up like the Thrilla in Manila
Flying my private jet to villas in Anguilla
Then throw you on a grill
Cause seven days a week you’re my five course meal
(For real)

177,177,For You,"[Verse 1]
All I saw was smoke and fire
I didn’t feel a thing
But suddenly I was rising higher
And I felt like I just made
The biggest mistake
When I thought about my unborn child
When I thought about my wife
And the answer rang out clear
From somewhere up above
No greater gift has man
Than to lay down his life for love

[Hook]
And I wonder, would I give my life
Could I make that sacrifice
If it came down to it
Could I take the bullet, I would
Yes I would, for you

[Verse 2]
Maybe you don’t understand
I don’t understand it all myself
But there’s a brother on my left and another on my right
And in his pocket just like mine
He’s got a photograph
And they’re waiting for him back home
It’s weighing on my mind
I’m not trying to be a hero
I don’t wanna die
But right now in this moment, you don’t think twice

[Hook]
And I wonder, would I give my life
Could I make that sacrifice
If it came down to it
Could I take the bullet, I would
Yes I would, for you

You don’t think about right
You don’t think about wrong
You just do what you gotta do, to defend your own
And I’d do the same
For you
Yes I would

I would give my life
I would make that sacrifice
Cause if it came down to it
Could I take a bullet
For you
Yes I would

It's my way or the highway, let me say it one more time
Middle fingers up to the world, to the world
To the wor-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-orld

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Mmm, ain't this some shit? Pulled up in the A-V-entador
And the doors, raise up, like praise the Lord
Did the fashion show, and a tour, and a movie, and a score
This a ghetto opera, Francis Foreign Car Coppola
I need a new crib to hold my plaques, Rick Ross had told me that
Said I'd be all up in Goldman Sachs
Like, these niggas tryna hold me back
These niggas tryna hold me back, I'm just tryna protect my stacks
Mitt Romney don't pay no tax, Mitt Romney don't pay no tax
Chi-Town 'til I'm on my back, Chi-Town 'til I'm on my back
Only nigga in Beverly Hills, where the hell is Axel Foley at?
""Ease up there, baby boy"": Ving Rhames told Jody that
R. Kelly and the God of rap, shitting on you, holy crap

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Let me see you put your middle fingers up!
To the world, to the world
To the wor-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-orld
To the world, to the world
To the wor-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-or-orld
Let me see you put your middle fingers up!

[Outro: Teyana Taylor]
I could give it all up, but it's not enough
Ay ay, here you go, my middle finger
To the world, to the world, from the ground to the moon
Hills to the mountains, yeah, hands to the roof
Give it up, give it up, won't let you deny me

And all that counts is here and now
My universe will never be the same
I'm glad you came (Came, came, came)

You hit me like the sky fell on me, fell on me
And I decided you look well on me, well on me
So let's go somewhere no one else can see
You and me

Turn the lights out now
Now, I'll take you by the hand
Hand you another drink
Drink it if you can
Can you spend a little time?

Stay with me, I can make
Make you glad you came

As explosions broke in the sky
All that I needed
Was the one thing I couldn't find

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
The colors conflicted
As the flames climbed into the clouds
I wanted to fix this
But couldn't stop from tearing it down

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And you were there at the turn
Caught in the burning glow
And I was there at the turn
Waiting to let you know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
You told me yes, you held me high
And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down when I kissed that ring
You lost that right to hold that crown
I built you up but you let me down
So when you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And you were there, at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down

Hello, I know it's been a while
I wonder where you are
And if you think of me sometimes
Cause you're always on my mind
You know I had it rough trying to forget you
But the more that I look around, the more I realize
You're all I'm looking for

[Chorus: Carly Rae Jepsen]
What makes you so beautiful
Is you don't know how beautiful you are, to me
You're not tryna be perfect
Nobody's perfect, but you are, to me
It's how you take my breath away
Feel the words that I don't say
I wish somehow I could say them now
Oh, I could say them now, yeah

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Just friends, the beginning or the end
How do we make sense, when we're on our own?
It's like you're the other half of me
I feel incomplete, yeah, should have known
Nothing in the world compares
To the feelings that we share, so not fair

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
What makes you so beautiful
Is you don't know how beautiful you are, to me
You're not tryna be perfect
Nobody's perfect, but you are, to me
You try to take my breath away
Feel the words that I don't say
I wish somehow
I could say them now, oh

[Bridge: Carly Rae Jepsen & Justin Bieber]
It's not you, blame it all on me, I was running from myself
Cause I couldn't tell how deep that we, we were gonna be
I was scared, it's destiny, but it hurts like hell
Hope it's not too late, just a twist of fate, yeah

[Chorus: Carly Rae Jepsen & Justin Bieber]
What makes you so beautiful
Is you don't know how beautiful you are, to me
You're not tryna be perfect
Nobody's perfect, but you are, to me
It's how you take my breath away
Feel the words that I don't say
I wish somehow I could say them now
Oh, I could say them now, mmm","['hello', 'i', 'know', 'its', 'be', 'a', 'while', 'i', 'wonder', 'where', 'you', 'be', 'and', 'if', 'you', 'think', 'of', 'me', 'sometimes', 'cause', 'youre', 'always', 'on', 'my', 'mind', 'you', 'know', 'i', 'have', 'it', 'rough', 'try', 'to', 'forget', 'you', 'but', 'the', 'more', 'that', 'i', 'look', 'around', 'the', 'more', 'i', 'realize', 'youre', 'all', 'im', 'look', 'for', 'what', 'make', 'you', 'so', 'beautiful', 'be', 'you', 'dont', 'know', 'how', 'beautiful', 'you', 'be', 'to', 'me', 'youre', 'not', 'tryna', 'be', 'perfect', 'nobodys', 'perfect', 'but', 'you', 'be', 'to', 'me', 'its', 'how', 'you', 'take', 'my', 'breath', 'away', 'feel', 'the', 'word', 'that', 'i', 'dont', 'say', 'i', 'wish', 'somehow', 'i', 'could', 'say', 'them', 'now', 'oh', 'i', 'could', 'say', 'them', 'now', 'yeah', 'just', 'friends', 'the', 'begin', 'or', 'the', 'end', 'how', 'do', 'we', 'make', 'sense', 'when', 'be', 'on', 'our', 'own', 'its', 'like', 'youre', 'the', 'other', 'half', 'of', 'me', 'i', 'feel', 'incomplete', 'yeah', 'should', 'have', 'know', 'nothing', 'in', 'the', 'world', 'compare', 'to', 'the', 'feel', 'that', 'we', 'share', 'so', 'not', 'fair', 'what', 'make', 'you', 'so', 'beautiful', 'be', 'you', 'dont', 'know', 'how', 'beautiful', 'you', 'be', 'to', 'me', 'youre', 'not', 'tryna', 'be', 'perfect', 'nobodys', 'perfect', 'but', 'you', 'be', 'to', 'me', 'you', 'try', 'to', 'take', 'my', 'breath', 'away', 'feel', 'the', 'word', 'that', 'i', 'dont', 'say', 'i', 'wish', 'somehow', 'i', 'could', 'say', 'them', 'now', 'oh', 'its', 'not', 'you', 'blame', 'it', 'all', 'on', 'me', 'i', 'be', 'run', 'from', 'myself', 'cause', 'i', 'couldnt', 'tell', 'how', 'deep', 'that', 'we', 'we', 'be', 'gonna', 'be', 'i', 'be', 'scar', 'its', 'destiny', 'but', 'it', 'hurt', 'like', 'hell', 'hope', 'its', 'not', 'too', 'late', 'just', 'a', 'twist', 'of', 'fate', 'yeah', 'what', 'make', 'you', 'so', 'beautiful', 'be', 'you', 'dont', 'know', 'how', 'beautiful', 'you', 'be', 'to', 'me', 'youre', 'not', 'tryna', 'be', 'perfect', 'nobodys', 'perfect', 'but', 'you', 'be', 'to', 'me', 'its', 'how', 'you', 'take', 'my', 'breath', 'away', 'feel', 'the', 'word', 'that', 'i', 'dont', 'say', 'i', 'wish', 'somehow', 'i', 'could', 'say', 'them', 'now', 'oh', 'i', 'could', 'say', 'them', 'now', 'mmm']",305,Carly Rae Jepsen,Carly Rae Jepsen Featuring Justin Bieber,2012,[87],1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0

184,184,Bag Of Money,"[Intro: Rick Ross]
Maybach Music
Money over everything
Self-made, but right now shorty
You looking like money
Talking 'bout real money
Huh (Maybach Music)

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
My bitch bad, lookin' like a bag of money
That bitch bad, lookin' like a bag of money
I go and get it and I let her count it for me
I fuck her good and she always ride it for me
My bitch bad, lookin' like a bag of money
That bitch bad, lookin' like a bag of money
I go and get it and I let her count it for me
I fuck her good and she always ride it for me
She got me caught up in the moment
She got me caught up in the moment
I only kiss her when she on it
Fuck her good, make her call me in the morning
My bitch bad, lookin' like a bag of money
That bitch bad, lookin' like a bag of money
I go and get it and I let her count it for me
I fuck her good and she always ride it for me
My bitch bad, lookin' like a bag of money
That bitch bad, lookin' like a bag of money
I go and get it and I let her count it for me
I fuck her good and she always ride it for me

[Verse 1: Wale]
Temporary forever, levitate with a nigga
I can tease you til you hate me
But you hate them navel kisses
We can do like 8 positions
Hit it 'til your make up missin'
Baby girl my stroke official
And you know I paint that picture
Hoes on my line, most of ‘em 9′s
Couple of ‘em dimes, but all my hoes is hard to find
And I ain't always on the prowl
It's just my soda mixed with brown
Got me quite open for a while
So let me in or let me out
And I like my marijuana bright
And I like my window tinted out
Shout out them strippers who hustle
Get yours; you know what this about
I just might throw a big amount
Don’t know if I’m ‘posed to take you out
I just know I’m ‘posed to praise you up
Don’t mean I ain't ‘posed to take you down
Word up

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
My bitch bad, lookin' like a bag of money
That bitch bad, lookin' like a bag of money
I go and get it and I let her count it for me
I fuck her good and she always ride it for me
My bitch bad, lookin' like a bag of money
That bitch bad, lookin' like a bag of money
I go and get it and I let her count it for me
I fuck her good and she always ride it for me

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
My bitch bad, lookin' like a bag of money
E’rry time she fuck me she say, “Can I have some money?”
And I say, “Can I get a threesome?”
She say, “Boy, you funny”
But I be like for real, just pick up that phone
Call on one of your girls
When I’m on that pill and I pop that Perc
Girl, I put in that work
Long as she come to me first
It's 14 racks, what I put on that purse
Shit, that Birkin bag make the old dude mad
When I murk through passed in a dark blue jag
Say she like my style but I talk too fast
And I got that drive and she just might crash
Hold up
She say she fuckin' with me the long way
She gon’ ride this dick, I had a long day
Nigga, look at my bitch, you looking the wrong way
Something mean, look exactly just like the song say

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
My bitch bad, lookin' like a bag of money
That bitch bad, lookin' like a bag of money
I go and get it and I let her count it for me
I fuck her good and she always ride it for me
My bitch bad, lookin' like a bag of money
That bitch bad, lookin' like a bag of money
I go and get it and I let her count it for me
I fuck her good and she always ride it for me
She got me caught up in the moment
She got me caught up in the moment
I only kiss her when she on it
Fuck her good, make her call me in the morning","['maybach', 'music', 'money', 'over', 'everything', 'selfmade', 'but', 'right', 'now', 'shorty', 'you', 'look', 'like', 'money', 'talk', 'bout',

185,185,Heart Skips A Beat,"[Intro: Olly Murs & Chiddy Bang]
My heart skips-skips-skips-skips-skips-skips a beat
Olly Murs, Chiddy Bang
Them girls make your heart skip like, like

[Verse 1: Olly Murs]
I can see, you're not yourself
Even when you're here, with me
I know that you're some, where else

[Pre-Chorus: Olly Murs]
So put another record on
Kiss and leave me on
Nothing really matters when we're dancing
Listen to the same sad song playing on repeat
'Cause every time we come this close, my heart skips, skips a beat

[Chorus: Olly Murs]
So come on, spin me around
Now I don't wanna go home
'Cause when you hold me like this, you know my heart skips, skips a beat
I know I should, but I can't leave it alone
And when you hold me like this, that's when my heart skips, skips a beat
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 2: Olly Murs]
So, hung up
We can't, let go
If you really have, to leave
One more time just move, me slow

[Pre-Chorus 2: Olly Murs]
So put another record on
Play it on repeat
Nothing really matters when we're dancing
Cause all you need to know, is what you do to me
And every time you hold me close, my heart skips, skips a beat

[Chorus: Olly Murs]
So come on, spin me around
Now I don't wanna go home
'Cause when you hold me like this, you know my heart skips, skips a beat
I know I should, but I can't leave it alone
And when you hold me like this, that's when my heart skips, skips a beat
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 3: Chiddy Bang]
Hey, you make my heart skip a beat like
Hey lady let me take you out to eat like
Uh I’m fittin' to knock it out the park girl
So put your boyfriend on, three strikes
Outta here, greedy I don't gotta share
We gon’ be up til the morning we don't gotta care
I’ma sit back and play my cards like solitaire
You and your friends come with us, like we outta there
Olly Murs, Chiddy yea!

[Chorus: Olly Murs]
So come on, spin me around
Now I don't wanna go home
'Cause when you hold me like this, you know my heart skips, skips a beat
I know I should, but I can't leave it alone
And when you hold me like this, that's when my heart skips, skips a beat
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Outro/Ad-Lib: Olly Murs]

186,186,Nobody's Perfect,"[Intro: J. Cole]
Ay, oh, yeah
Cole world, ah, oh, yeah

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, this is for all the fans that waited, the bitch niggas that hated
Old hoes we dated, look, Mama; we made it
Your son out in Barbados, cheese, eggs, and potatoes
Smokin' weed on the beach as my mind workin' like Plato's
Analyzin' the world, fantasizin' 'bout girls
I'm handin' diamonds and pearls, and vandalizin' her curls
Sweatin' her weave out, moans as she breathes out
Fuck I'm doin' in parties with Hova and Steve Stoute
I step over piranha, death over dishonor
They killin' niggas for J's, that's death over designer
Hey, Cole heatin' up like that left-over lasagna
Remember when I used to be stressed over D'wana
Now a nigga only text and get stressed over Rihannas
I'm talkin' tens and better, hood bitches in Timbs and sweaters
And we always argue 'bout the same thing
And tell me, why we gotta argue about the same thing, same thing, man?

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Nobody's perfect, uh
Nobody's perfect, ay ay, uh
Hey, but you're perfect for me
Nobody's perfect, uh (Ay, ay, ay)
Nobody's perfect, ay
Hey, but you're perfect for me
We rollin', we ridin'
He like to go inside and
I love to go all night and
We rock the boat: Poseidon
I love to call your name, name, name
Yeah, baby, I love to call your name, name, name, eh

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Oh yeah, to my college girl: Take the weekend off and come home soon
I graduated way too long ago to be sneakin' all in your dorm room
But that thing tight like Fort Knox
So I call you when the tour stops
But baby, where your roommates?
Did you make sure the door's locked?
She love it when we get together
Smoke a little weed, put her shit together
Now that I'm on I can pick and choose
Only fuck with hoes who got shit to lose
Yeah, I heard the stories 'bout different dudes
Her man on campus, but it's fine by me
She say she only fucked like four–five niggas
So you know you gotta multiply by three

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Nobody's perfect, uh
Nobody's perfect, ay ay, uh
Hey, but you're perfect for me
Nobody's perfect, uh (Ay, ay, ay)

I remember your bare feet, down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back

I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me waking me up

I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

[Chorus]
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years

[Verse 2]
I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming ""Why?""
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died

And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted, if you were still here
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
I whispered in your ear

[Chorus]
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
Out of this curtain room and this hospital grey, we'll just disappear
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years

[Bridge]
What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
What if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?

[Chorus]
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
Come on baby with me we're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years

On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true
Cause you moved to west L.A. or New York or Santa Fe
Or wherever to get away from me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh but that one night
Was more than just right
I didn't leave you cause I was all through
Oh I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

[Chorus]
Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a 2-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
The way you do me
Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya
This is not a drive by

[Verse 2]
On the other side of a downward spiral
My love for you went viral
And I loved you every mile you drove away
But now here you are again
So let's skip the ""How you been?""
And get down to the ""more than friends"" at last

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh but that one night was still the highlight
I didn't need you until I came to
And I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

Oh I swear to ya
I'll be there for ya

There's nothing up my sleeve but love for you
And a little time to get my head together too

Make the money while the sunlight shines
But anything i gotta get done

(RedOne...)
Let's go to the beach, each
Let's go get away
They say, what they gonna say?
Have a drink, clink, found the bud light
Bad - like me is hard to come by
The patron own, let's go get it on
The zone own, yes I'm in the zone
Is it two, three? Leave a good tip
I'mma blow off my money and don't give two -

[Pre-Hook]
I'm on the floor, floor
I love to dance
So give me more, more, 'til I can't stand
Get on the floor, floor
Like it's your last chance
If you want more, more
Then here I am

[Hook]
Starships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Can't stop cause we're so high
Let's do this one more time
Starships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Let's do this one last time
Hands up...
(We're higher than a -er) [x3]

[Verse 2]
Jump in my hoopty-hoopty-hoop
I own that
And I ain't paying my rent this month
I owe that
But check who you want, and check who you like
Dance all night there's no end in sight
Twinkle, twinkle little star

[Bridge]
Now everybody let me hear you say ray ray ray
Now spend all your money cause they pay pay pay
And if you're a G, you a G-G-G
My name is Onika, you can call me Nicki

Get on the floor, floor
Like it's your last chance
If you want more, more
Then here I am

I went out last night
I'm going out tonight again
Anything to capture your attention (Your attention)
And she's a real sweet girl
And you know I got a boy
Details we both forgot to mention (Forgot to mention)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And you...
I always know where you are
And you always know where I am
We're takin' it way too far
But I don't want it to end

[Chorus]
This kiss is something I can't resist
Your lips are undeniable
This kiss is something I can't risk
Your heart is unreliable
Something so sentimental
You make so detrimental
And I wish it didn't feel like this
'Cause I don't wanna miss this kiss
I don't wanna miss this kiss
(This kiss, this kiss, this kiss)

[Verse 2]
You know you're just my type
And your eyes are lock and key
To my heart, tempting my confession (My confession)
And you're a real hot thing
But you know I've got a boy somewhere
So, can you feel the tension? (Feel the tension)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And you...
I'm dancin' to where you are
And you're dancin' to where I am
We're takin' it way too far
But I don't want it to end

[Chorus]
This kiss is something I can't resist
Your lips are undeniable
This kiss is something I can't risk
Your heart is unreliable
Something so sentimental
You make so detrimental
And I wish it didn't feel like this
'Cause I don't wanna miss this kiss

You lean in closer, and I shouldn't, I shouldn't, I
But if you ask me to, I couldn't, I couldn't, I

This kiss is something I can't resist
Your lips are undeniable
This kiss is something I can't risk

I believe in better days
That's why I pray

Some stupid video posted as a joke, somebody's life gets ruined
Out of everything we can create
Where is the cure to keep the sick from losing
Babies having babies cause their parents are always gone
Somehow we have forgotten how to make a house a home
How to make a house a home
Oh! Oh! Yeah! Yeah!

I'm begging for forgiveness, I wanna make a difference
Even in the smallest way
I'm only one person, but I can feel it working
I believe in better days
That's why I pray, yeah
That's why I pray, yeah

These demons from my past haunt me every night
And I just can't get through it
If I could forget them on my own, I'll let go and just move on
But heaven knows I am only human

And that's why I pray, yeah yeah
That's why I pray, I pray, I pray, I pray

Yes I'm begging for forgiveness
I just wanna make a difference
I believe in better days
That's why I pray","['oh', 'oh', 'oh', 'oh', 'oh', 'oh', 'yeah', 'man', 'on', 'the', 'tvs', 'go', 'insane', 'everybodys', 'just', 'laugh', 'people', 'cross', 'the', 'world', 'hold', 'on', 'the', 'earth', 'cave', 'in', 'the', 'ocean', 'come', 'down', 'crash', 'my', 'neighbor', 'lose', 'his', 'house', 'cause', 'he', 'cant', 'find', 'a', 'job', 'dont', 'you', 'dare', 'pledge', 'allegiance', 'dont', 'you', 'dare', 'speak', 'of', 'god', 'speak', 'of', 'god', 'oh', 'oh', 'oh', 'oh', 'now', 'im', 'beg', 'for', 'forgiveness', 'i', 'wanna', 'make', 'a', 'difference', 'even', 'in', 'the', 'smallest', 'way', 'im', 'only', 'one', 'person', 'but', 'i', 'can', 'feel', 'it', 'work', 'i', 'believe', 'in', 'better', 'days', 'thats', 'why', 'i', 'pray', 'some', 'stupid', 'video', 'post', 'as', 'a', 'joke', 'somebodys', 'life', 'get', 'ruin', 'out', 'of', 'everything', 'we', 'can', 'create', 'where', 'be', 'the', 'cure', 'to', 'keep', 'the', 'sick', 'from', 'lose', 'baby', 'have', 'baby', 'cause', 'their', 'parent', 'be', 'always', 'go', 'somehow', 'we', 'have', 'forget', 'how', 'to', 'make', 'a', 'house', 'a', 'home', 'how', 'to', 'make', 'a', 'house', 'a', 'home', 'oh', 'oh', 'yeah', 'yeah', 'im', 'beg', 'for', 'forgiveness', 'i', 'wanna', 'make', 'a', 'difference', 'even', 'in', 'the', 'smallest', 'way', 'im', 'only', 'one', 'person', 'but', 'i', 'can', 'feel', 'it', 'work', 'i', 'believe', 'in', 'better', 'days', 'thats', 'why', 'i', 'pray', 'yeah', 'thats', 'why', 'i', 'pray', 'yeah', 'these', 'demons', 'from', 'my', 'past', 'haunt', 'me', 'every', 'night', 'and', 'i', 'just', 'cant', 'get', 'through', 'it', 'if', 'i', 'could', 'forget', 'them', 'on', 'my', 'own', 'ill', 'let', 'go', 'and', 'just', 'move', 'on', 'but', 'heaven', 'know', 'i', 'be', 'only', 'human', 'and', 'thats', 'why', 'i', 'pray', 'yeah', 'yeah', 'thats', 'why', 'i', 'pray', 'i', 'pray', 'i', 'pray', 'i', 'pray', 'yes', 'im', 'beg', 'for', 'forgiveness', 'i', 'just', 'wanna', 'make', 'a', 'difference', 'i', 'believe', 'in', 'better', 'days', 'thats', 'why', 'i', 'pray']",266,Big and Rich,Big & Rich,2012,"[89, 84, 86, 82, 86, 88, 88, 93, 96, 99]",10,That's Why I Pray,https://open.spotify.com/track/6WDjQq0Noeji2O3bFfFsNW,6WDjQq0Noeji2O3bFfFsNW,spotify:track:6WDjQq0Noeji2O3bFfFsNW,Hillbilly Jedi,02SL9mYlZERoTqeaPFhxdf,spotify:album:02SL9mYlZERoTqeaPFhxdf,Big & Rich,0oBEeN6BCxEgMogzThqrPf,spotify:artist:0oBEeN6BCxEgMogzThqrPf,241.893,12.0,37.0,2012-09-18,0.57,0.727,8.0,-5.297999999999999,1.0,0.0256,0.0334,0.0,0.364,0.491,100.01899999999999,"['contemporary country', 'country', 'country road', 'modern country rock']",[],1.0

Diamonds all on my ring nigga
Gold watches, gold chain nigga
Hundred thou' on champagne nigga
Yeah my money insane nigga
Yeah I'm making it rain nigga
But I was just on the plane nigga
Buying gear, flying here
Fuck what you heard, it’s my time of year
If I'm in the club, I get a hundred stacks
I'm always rolling up so I get love for that
Them niggas stole my swag but I don't want it back
My nigga uh! I was on this, but now I'm onto that
You see it in my closet before it's on the rack
Was out there in Hawaii, now I'm goin back
My nigga uh! I got so much money I should start a bank
So much paper right in front of me it's hard to think
Buy so many bottles it's gon' be hard to drink
But I'm still pourin' up and my family here and they rolling up so uh!

The bigger the bill, the harder you ball
Well I'm throwing mine, cause my money long
The quicker you here, the faster you go
That's why where I come from the only thing we know is..

Bitch I'm out this world, girl you know I'm a star
Used to buying rounds but now we buy the bar
Last year they had to ask now they know who we are
Boss shit, walk in the building, I own shit
You can tell by who I'm on the phone with
Yeah nigga talking about grown shit
Niggas too busy jacking my swag
Need to fuck around, get your own shit
Get your own cars, get your own clothes
Get your own smoke, get your own bitch
You ain't reppin' my gang, get your own clique

Make sure you do whatever is that you gotta do, that's your job
And niggas gon' hate but that's no prob'
So hey fuck 'em don't need nothing from 'em
Some niggas talking but the shit they claiming don't mean nothing
It's straight from Cali, that's what's in my joint that's what I'm puffin', OG
And been one since I was young enough to know that everybody was gonna know me
Most niggas don't see

Party going wild, fist pumping
Music, I might lose it
Blast to the roof, that how we do'z it (do'z it do'z it)
I don't care the night, she don't care we like
Almost dared the right five
Ready to get live, ain't no surprise
Take me so high, jump and don't stop
Surfing the crowd ooh said I gotta be the man
When they heading my van, mic check one two
Shut them down in the club while the playboy does it, and y'all get lose lose
Out the bottle, we all get bent and again tomorrow
Gotta break loose cause that's the motto
Club shuts down, a hundred super models

Number one, club popper
Got a hangover like too much vodka
Can't see me with ten binoculars, so cool
No doubt by the end of the night
Got the clothes coming off til I make that move
Somehow, someway, gotta raise the roof, roof
All black shades when the sun come through
Oh, it's on like everything goes, round up baby til the freaky show
What happens to that body, it's a private show
Stays right here, private show
I like em untamed, don't tell me hide pain
Tolerance, bottoms up with the champagne
My life, coming harder when we hit fame
Do you busy with the bail, we get insane

Show me how you do
I want to shut down the club, with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones (wild ones, wild ones) ooh

Saddle me up and lets begin
I am a wild one, tame me now
Running with wolves and I'm on the prowl
Show you another side of me
A side you would never thought you would see
Tear up that body dominate you til you had 'nough
I hear you like the wild stuff

Where's your brain?
Checking in to check you out
Concerned about your whereabouts
Copy that, you're acting strange
So tell me what is going on
So heavy I bet

I'm hella positive for real, I'm all good no

No big deal (I can handle it)
It'll bounce off me (I can handle it)

Doesn't matter anymore

Are you insane? (are you kidding me?)
Underneath the avalanche
So heavy again

200,200,Both Of Us,"[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Uhh
Ever thought about losing it
When your money’s all gone and you lose your whip
You might lose your grip when the landlord tell you that you due for rent
And the grass so green on the other side
Make a nigga wanna run straight through the fence
Open up the fridge 'bout 20 times
But you still can’t find no food in it
That’s foolishness
And sometimes I wonder, why we care so much about the way we look
And the way we talk and the way we act and the clothes we bought
How much that cost?
Does it even really matter?
'Cause if life is a uphill battle
But y’all tryna climb with the same ol’ ladder
In the same boat, with the same ol’ paddle
Why so shallow? I’m just askin'
What’s the pattern to the madness?
Everybody ain’t a number one draft pick
Most of us ain’t Hollywood actors
But if it’s all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all could ball
Do it one time for the underdogs
Sincerely yours, from one of y'all

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
I could feel your pain, I could feel your struggle
You just wanna live, but everything's so low
That you could drown in a puddle
That’s why I gotta hold us up, yeah, hold us up
For all the times no one’s ever spoke for us
To every single time that they play this song
You can say that that’s what Bobby Ray wrote for us
When the tides get too high
And the sea up underneath gets so deep
And you feel like you’re just another person
Getting lost in the crowd, way up high in the nosebleeds
Uh, because we've both been there, both of us
But we still stand tall with our shoulders up
And even though we always against the odds
These are the things that’ve molded us
And if life hadn’t chosen us
Sometimes I wonder where I would've wound up
'Cause if it was up to me, I’d make a new blueprint
Then build it from the ground up, hey
But if it’s all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all could ball
Do it one time for the underdogs
From Bobby Ray, to all of y’all

201,201,The Wind,"[Verse 1]
30,000 feet above
The city where I fell in love with you
And the fading concrete skyline
Brings an urban lullaby that still rings true
When I passed you on the street that day
Should've let that red scarf fly away
Like any chance I had of keeping you
Like the Northern wind blowing
Yeah, my lonely heart was frozen
Never knew I'd find a way to break yours, too

[Chorus]
Where the wind blows babe
You can bet I'll be riding high with it
Holding on for my dear life just like I always did
Close your eyes babe, take a breath
Say my name and I'll be there
My love will find you anywhere
Anywhere my love

[Verse 2]
The city lights look like a country sky
Like staring at the stars turned upside down
I wish I may, I wish I might
Find it in your heart to stick around
I hate it had to end this way
Tomorrow is a brand new day
And the chances here at love are precious few
Someone's out there waiting
For a sweet good timing lady
To make you smile the way I always wanted to

[Chorus]
Where the wind blows babe
You can bet I'll be riding high with it
Holding on for my dear life just like I always did
Close your eyes babe, take a breath
Say my name and I'll be there
My love will find you anywhere
Anywhere my love

[Bridge]
So I will fly all night
Our memory's my lullaby
That love will not lie
If it is love done right
You'll be waiting on the other side
Arms open wide
If love do not lie
Lie
We can fly

[Chorus]
Where the wind blows babe
You can bet I'll be riding high with it
Holding on for my dear life just like I always did
Close your eyes babe, take a breath
Say my name and I'll be there
My love will find you anywhere
Anywhere my love

[Outro]
My love will find you anywhere

I'm better, so much better now
I see the light, touch the light, we're together now
I'm better, so much better now
Look to the skies, gives me life, we're together now

[Refrain]
We've only just begun, hypnotized by drums
Until forever comes, you'll find us chasing the sun
They said this day wouldn't come, we refused to run
We've only just begun, you'll find us chasing the sun

[Post-Chorus]

[Hook]
And when they say life's faded
We're gonna play in the dark 'til it's golden again
And now it feels so amazing
Can't see it coming, I will never grow old again
You'll find us chasing the sun

[Verse 2]
I'm never, I'm never down
Lying here, staring up, and you're looking down
I'm never, I'm never down
Live forever, forever with you around

Until forever comes, you'll find us chasing the sun

Okay now snapbacks and tattoos
Rap phat I'm that dude
My backpack got cash that
I make an ass clap like tap shoes
I'm international
Y'all niggas vaginal
I pass through, fresh to death
You've now entered swag school
Ladies holding kisses
Swag as cold as sickness
Team Driiky tatted on 'em cause their ass is so ridiculous
In the 'Mazzi, paparazzi
Man they can't control the pictures
M.O.B. tat, screaming money over bitches
My clothes and tatts they're all custom though
Something that you ain't accustom to
Don't collapse with the Huxtables
Hoes like hats they adjustable
This is for my ladies and my fellas getting gravy
But your body's marked up, like the train back in the 80s
I've been through the test
Now, Ink on my chest
Trying to triple my checks
I spit through the rest
Buy you a Mitchell & Ness
Fly and It'll fit you the best
From NY to LA
North Cackalack to Baton Rouge
All across the latitude
Everybody rockin' them

""Clack Clack"" and snatch jewels
Pack tools, Crap shoot
And sell crack in glass tubes
Our chicks? Attitude
Hard enough to get at a dude
Tatted up, fattest butt
Suck it off, vacuum
Trips to Miami Ink
After that, Lowrider
When I say we're balling trick
I don't mean no globetrotter
Driicky is a monster, ain't a heir up in his safe
Since I murder raps, I should tatt a tear up on my face
Can't you hear this flow? It's evil
Can't be near us close to lethal
Y'all are weird
Yo I'm just here to spit 'bout piercings, clothes, and needles
Grab some cheer-up for the people
Rappers fear cause most are feeble
I don't have to smoke I rap the dope considered so illegal
To all my Gs up, can I just get a witness
If you're inked up, throw your feet up
Or you're stylin' in a Mitch-Ness
Ain't leaving out my females
I'm talking 'bout that ass too
Show 'em all
Roll Call
Let them bitches know we wear them

205,205,Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You),"[Verse 1]
You know the bed feels warmer
Sleepin' here alone
You know I dream in color
And do the things I want

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You think you got the best of me
Think you’ve had the last laugh
Bet you think that everything good is gone
Think you left me broken down
Think that I'd come running back
Baby, you don't know me, ’cause you're dead wrong

[Chorus]
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I’m over ’cause you're gone
What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself, and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I’m alone

[Verse 2]
You heard that I was starting over with someone new
They told you I was movin' on and over you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You didn't think that I'd come back
I'd come back swinging
You tried to break me, but you see

[Chorus]
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself, and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

[Bridge]
Thanks to you, I got a new thing started
Thanks to you, I'm not the broken-hearted
Thanks to you I'm finally thinkin' 'bout me
You know in the end, the day you left was just my beginning
In the end

[Chorus]
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself, and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

206,206,Battle Scars,"[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
Yara iyileşir derler -ki asla iyileşmez
Bu sevgi ile savaşmana yol açıyor
Sevgi ile savaştasın, evet

[Hook: Guy Sebastian]
Bu savaş yaraları geçecek gibi durmuyor
Asla yok olacak gibi durmuyor
Yaralar asla değişmeyecek
Bu savaş

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Bir yaranın beni yıkması için asla vermedim izni
Ama bu enkaz bana kur yapıyor gibi
Oklar gelişigüzel geliyor ve Eros yapıyor galiba fazla mesai
Salak gibi hissediyorsun çünkü biliyorsun hayır artık biz diye bir şey yok
Fakat sen olasılıkları yenmeye çalıştıkça
Ben senin moralini yüksek tutmaya çalışıyorum ve sende biliyorsun bilmen gerekeni
Ve bırak kızı gitsin fakat o bilinmeyenin korkusu
Kızın başka bir sevgilisi olması gönderir seni tekrar savaş alanına
(Git!) fakat yoktur bir Tom Hanks seni eve geri getirecek
Şiiriyle ön cephede olan bir aşık, değildir bir savaşçı
Tüfek yazmayı dene kendine, belki git şarkını bile
Tanklarla ve drone’larla savaşmak için, yalnız olmandan dolayı

[Pre-Hook: Guy Sebastian]
Keşke hiç bakmasaydım, keşke hiç dokunmasaydım
Keşke sana sırılsıklam aşkımı bitirebilsem
Çünkü benim sadece ikimizi bir arada tutmaya çalışan
Tüm işaretler seni unutmam gerektiğini söylerken
Keşke en iyisi sen olmasaydın, yaşadığım en iyisi
Keşke, keşke iyilik üstesinden gelseydi kötülüğün
Çünkü bu asla bitmeyecek, ta ki sen bitti diyene kadar

[Hook: Guy Sebastian]
Bu savaş yaraları, geçecek gibi durmuyor
Gidecek gibi durmuyor
Yaralar asla değişmeyecek
Bu savaş yaraları, geçecek gibi durmuyor
Gidecek gibi durmuyor
Yaralar asla değişmeyecek
Bu savaş

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
(O zaman git hadi terket)
Söylememen gerekiyordu fakat söyledin
(Ve umarım asla geri dönmezsin)
Olmaması gerekiyordu ama sen sebep oldun
Şimdi düşmüşsün yere “Doktor” diye bağırıyorsun
Bunun getirdiği tek şey travma sonrası stresi
Kalkanlar, çelik yelekler ve zırhlar
Adam akıllı çalışmıyor, bu yüzden kilitlendin sen acıdan yapılmış bir dolaba
Düşman senin içinde ve gelen tüm kurşunlar da arkadaşlarından
Artık en iyi ilaç kızın kazanmasına izin vermek gibi duruyor

[Pre-Hook 2: Guy Sebastian]
Keşke artık hissetmesem, keşke artık sevmesem
Keşke durdurabilsem çünkü mahvediyor bu beni
Çünkü benim sadece ikimizi bir arada tutmaya çalışan
Tüm işaretler seni unutmam gerektiğini söylerken
Keşke en iyisi sen olmasaydın, yaşadığım en iyisi
Keşke, keşke iyilik üstesinden gelseydi kötülüğün
Çünkü bu asla bitmeyecek, ta ki sen bitti diyene kadar

[Hook: Guy Sebastian]
Bu savaş yaraları, geçecek gibi durmuyor
Gidecek gibi durmuyor
Yaralar asla değişmeyecek
Bu savaş yaraları, geçecek gibi durmuyor
Gidecek gibi durmuyor
Yaralar asla değişmeyecek
Bu savaş

[Bridge: Guy Sebastian & (Lupe Fiasco)]
Çünkü beni ateşe verdin (ateşe)
Asla bu kadar canlı hissetmemiştim, evet!
(Hayır, umuyorsun ki yaralar iyileşir -ki asla iyileşmez
İşte bu sevgi ile savaşmana yol açıyor)
Ve artık dönüşü olmayan yerdeyim
Ve imkansız bunu düzeltmek

[Pre-Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
Görüyorsun, yaralar iyileşir diye umdun -ki asla iyileşmez
Bu sevgi ile savaşmana yol açıyor
İyileşir diye um -ki asla iyileşmez
Bu sevgi ile savaşmana yol açıyor!

[Hook: Guy Sebastian]
Bu savaş yaraları, geçecek gibi durmuyor
Gidecek gibi durmuyor
Ben asla değişmeyececeğim
Bu savaş yaraları, geçecek gibi durmuyor
Gidecek gibi durmuyor
Yaralar asla değişmeyecek
Bu savaş yaraları, geçecek gibi durmuyor
Gidecek gibi durmuyor
Yaralar asla değişmeyecek
Bu savaş

207,207,Postcard From Paris,"[Verse 1]
I remember when my heart caught the fever
You were standing all alone in the summer heat
I was with my boyfriend, my new boyfriend
He was as sweet as he could be
But one look at you and I was through
My heart switched up on me

[Chorus]
Like a postcard from Paris when I've seen the real thing
It's like finding out your diamond is from her old promise ring
A call back from your fortune teller
She read your cards upside down
The meanest thing you ever did is come around
And now, I'm ruined
I'm ruined

[Verse 2]
In the evening you can catch me daydreaming
Did that moment send you reeling just like me?
I should've gone over, right over
I shoulda never let you leave
But it's the never-knowing that keeps this going
And drives me crazy

[Chorus]
Like a postcard from Paris when I've seen the real thing
It's like finding out your diamond is from her old promise ring
A call back from your fortune teller
She read your cards upside down
The meanest thing you ever did is come around

[Bridge]
Just when I thought things were alright
My eyes play tricks on my mind, yeah
Will I ever be satisfied 'cause all I ever seem to find is a...

The meanest thing you ever did is come around

209,209,Wanted You More,"[Verse 1: Charles Kelley]
I kept waiting on a reason
And a call that never came
No, I never saw it coming
Something in you must have changed

[Verse 2: Hillary Scott]
All the words unspoken, promises broken
I cried for so long
Wasted too much time, should've seen the signs
Now I know just what went wrong

[Chorus: Lady Antebellum]
I guess I wanted you more
And looking back now, I'm sure
I wanted you more
I guess I wanted you more

[Verse 3: Charles Kelley]
All the nights we spent, just talking
Of the things we wanted out of life (Out of life)
Making plans and dreams together
I wish I'd seen, I was just too blind

[Verse 4: Hillary Scott]
My heart was open, exposed and hoping
For you to lay it on the line
In the end, it seemed there was no room for me
Still, I tried to change your mind

I guess I wanted you more
And looking back now, I'm sure
I wanted you more
I guess I wanted you more

Havana Brown
RedOne
Mr Worldwide
From Miami, Morocco, to Australia
To the world, Dale!
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em
Woop!
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em
Woop!

[Verse 1: Havana Brown]
When the sun goes down, down, down, down
Boy, are you afraid of the dark, dark?
And when the lights go out, out, out, out
Tell me, do you know where to start, start?
And when the bass gets loud, loud, loud
That is when I feel a part, part
And when the world sleeps sound, sound, sound, sound
Well, the sound is the key to my heart, heart

[Chorus: Havana Brown]
We run, yes, we run the night (Night, night, night, night)
We run, yes, we run the night
(We, we, we run, we, we, we run)
We run, yes, we run the night (The night)
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop!
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop!
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop!

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
From the bottom of the map, Miami
To the land down under, Australia
You feel my draft, see my vision, and hear my hunger (My hunger)
As my money gets older, their's get younger
They sell their soul, but the devil knows I have no number
I'm global, baby (Hey!)
Official, baby (Hey!)
Go, go, baby (Hey!)
Oh, oh, baby (Hey!)
No, no, baby (Hey!)
Yeah, yeah, baby
Now jiggle it, baby
Let me tickle it, baby
I know I'm lost; it's gonna be hard to save me
I'm sorry; that's how Dade County raised me
Ya heard me, right? We run the night
Now fuck you, pay me (Woo!)

We run, yes, we run the night (Night, night, night, night)
We run, yes, we run the night

Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop!
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop!

Brushing past me, all over my skin, skin
I can't get enough, 'nough, 'nough
'Cause the beat keep pullin' me in (In)
Takin' me so high up, up, up
A place that I've never been, ohhh
Party, party all night, night, night
Sleep all day, then do it again, 'gain

You know we smokin' on Keisha
Hey, hey, hey can I meet ya?

[Chorus]
Cool
36 Os so riding round with that nina
Riding with a ho named Keisha, smoking on Keisha
My diamonds talk for me, they say, ""Hi, can I meet you?""
G5, how high in the sky, ho I can't see you
Got a condo on my wrist, girl, I'm cashing out
Got a condo around my neck, girl, I'm cashing out
36 Os so I'm riding round with that nina
My diamonds talk for me, they say ""Hi, can I meet you?""

[Verse 1]
I got Versace all on my back
These hoes all on my back
Plus these plugs all on my back
Cause they know I'm moving that pack
These Louies all in my face
Four-fifths stay up on my waist
Plus it ain't on me for nothing so please don't make me catch a case
Cause bitch I'm 'bout it
Me walking round with no check on me, psshh
Yeah I doubt it
Your girl ain't finna leave with me, psshh

And I'm like, ""What the hell they talking 'bout?""
And if I got it I bought it, cause boy, you know I'm cashing out

[Verse 2]
Okay, I drop the top: hop in
Hoes they coming by flocks in
Birds they coming by flocks in
Pass them birds like Stockton
Play with my money I'm popping
No acting, but it's a movie
Got Spinz on the beat so we ain't losing
Don't act like your ho ain't choosin
I done blowed up, yeah I'm the bomb
Riding round blowing on stank bombs
Pussy so good you should thank moms
Top-floor suite chilling at the Palms
We want the whole loaf, leave y'all the crumbs
Till then I'm running my check up
And it's fuck a Bugatti, I'm calling my jet up

[Chorus]
Cool
36 Os so riding round with that nina
Riding with a ho named Keisha, smoking on Keisha
My diamonds talk for me, they say, ""Hi, can I meet you?""

My diamonds talk for me, they say ""Hi, can I meet you?""

[Verse 3]
It's big pimping over here... Church
Time to cop the Maybach, already had the vert
I got big money visions, Sammy Sosa pigeons
What that mean? That mean they jumping out the kitchen
And I'm on the money mission, nobody can stop me
Just grab your camcorder, press record and go on and watch me
And you can skate on my ice just like you playing hockey
And in the booth I beat the beat up, call me Rocky
Yeah I'm cocky

Just waking up in the morning
And to be well
Quite honest with ya
I ain't really sleep well
Ya ever feel like your train of thought's been derailed?
That's when you press on - Lee nails
Half the population's just waitin to see me fail
Yeah right, you're better off trying to freeze hell
Some of us do it for the females
And others do it for the retail

But I do it for the kids, life threw the towel in on
Everytime you fall it's only making your chin strong
And I'll be in your corner like mick, baby, til the end
Or when you hear a song from that big lady

[Bridge]
Until the referee rings the bell
Until both your eyes start to swell
Until the crowd goes home
What we gonna do ya'll?

[Chorus - Ryan Tedder]
Give em hell, turn their heads
Gonna live life til we're dead
Give me scars, give me pain
Then they'll say to me, say to me, say to me
There goes the fighter, there goes the fighter
Here comes the fighter
That's what they'll say to me, say to me, say to me
This one's a fighter

[Verse 2]
And if I can last thirty rounds
There's no reason you should ever have your head down
Six foot five, two hundred and twenty pounds
Hailing from rock bottom, loserville, nothing town

Text book version of a kid going nowhere fast
And now I'm yelling ""kiss my ass""
It's gonna take a couple right hooks, a few left jabs
For you to recognize you really ain't got it bad

[Bridge]
Until the referee rings the bell
Until both your eyes start to swell
Until the crowd goes home
What we gonna do ya'll?

[Chorus - Ryan Tedder]
Give em hell, turn their heads
Gonna live life til we're dead
Give me scars, give me pain
Then they'll say to me, say to me, say to me
There goes the fighter, there goes the fighter
Here comes the fighter
That's what they'll say to me, say to me, say to me
This one's a fighter

Everybody put yo hands up
What we gonna do? [x6] ya'll

If you fall pick yourself up off the floor (get up)
And when your bones can't take no more (c'mon)
Just remember what you're here for
Cause I know Im'ma damn sure

Give em hell, turn their heads
Gonna live life til we're dead
Give me scars, give me pain
Then they'll say to me, say to me, say to me
There goes the fighter, there goes the fighter
Here comes the fighter
That's what they'll say to me, say to me, say to me
This one's a fighter

213,213,Throw That,"[Intro: Eminem]
Right about now
You're about to be possessed
By the sounds of Slaughterhouse

[Chorus: Eminem]
She strips to get tips
Those lips and those childbearing hips
I'll throw this—I'll throw this dick on you, girl
I'll throw this—I'll throw this dick on you, girl
Gonna make you feel me if I gotta shake this building till I make you spill drinks
Girl, this whole building is probably filled with lil' ding-a-lings
But not me, I'll—I'll throw this dick on you, girl (Throw that D)
I'll throw this—I'll throw this dick on you, girl (Throw that D)

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"" + Eminem + Bad Meets Evil]
They call me, ""Nickle Nina,"" a.k.a. (""Royce!"")
A.k.a. (""Throw-That-D""), a player gotta keep a condom on 'cause we play safe, aye
Then I'm taking the condom off 'cause I skeet they face
Then I turn off Jodeci 'cause they say, “Baby, won't you just stay?"" but you can’t stay—aye!
It ain't trickin' if you gettin it, if you ain't got that, you ain't ballin’—you mad
They call me, ""botox,"" up in Hermès 'cause I help them get rid of all those bags
(All those bags?) I throw this brick on you, girl
Then I drink up, what's your number? I’mma throw this dick on you, girl

[Pre-Chorus]
(Aye, girl—clap that!)
She’s got it—oh, she got all the homies (Now, clap that!)
In here, excited, oh, I don't really know (If ya clap now!)
How to describe it
Yeah, yeah, 'cause the strippers love me and I love them too
My bitch be like, ""What am I gon' do witchu?"" All I know is that I got a thing for her

[Chorus: Eminem + Royce Da 5'9""]
She strips to get tips (Hey!)
Those lips and those childbearing hips
I'll throw this—I'll throw this dick on you, girl
I'll throw this—I'll throw this dick on you, girl
Gonna make you feel me if I gotta shake this building till I make you spill drinks
Girl, this whole building is probably filled with lil' ding-a-lings
But not me, I'll—I'll throw this dick on you, girl (Throw that D)
I'll throw this—I'll throw this dick on you, girl (Throw that D)

[Verse 2: Crooked I + Eminem]
I’m Crooked I, a.k.a., ""Fuck-Your-Girl""
(Throw that D) up-up in the sky, when it come down, say—(""Fuck the world!"")
These strippers are sprung, my middle initial is R, for Richard
And my nickname's right on the tip of her tongue, the side of her mouth is drippin' with—egg
Uh, I’m drunk right now, stumped right now; tryna figure out how
To get four chicks to sit on one chair—oh, yeah—turn the chair upside down
(Upside down?) I throw this grip on you, girl (Girl)
Talking that handcuff you ain't never coming home, man, finna trip on you, girl (Girl)

[Pre-chorus: Royce Da 5'9"" + Crooked I]
(Aye, girl—clap that!)
She’s got it—oh, she got all the homies (Now, clap that!)
In here, excited, oh, I don't really know (If ya clap now!)
How to describe it
Baby, you got some incredible skills
I want brain, you want shoes—true love's always head over heels

[Chorus: Eminem + Royce Da 5'9""]
'Cause she strips to get tips (Hey!)
Those lips and those childbearing hips (I love you!)
I'll throw this—I'll throw this dick on you, girl
I'll throw this—I'll throw this dick on you, girl
Gonna make you feel me if I gotta shake this building till I make you spill drinks
Girl, this whole building is probably filled with lil' ding-a-lings
But not me, I'll—I'll throw this dick on you, girl (Throw that D)
I'll throw this—I'll throw this dick on you, girl (Throw that D)

[Bridge: Eminem]
I said, ""Yo, yo—
You got me on a string, I'm dangling like a yo-yo
You string me along and leave me hangin', and that's a no-no
In my world, 'cause I'll—I'll throw this dick on you girl.""

[Verse 3: Joe Budden + Eminem]
Look—(Throw that D)—they call me, ""Joe Butt-In,"" I be around when them hoes strut in (Throw that D)
This relationship is 50/50—if you meet me halfway, I get the whole nut in
'Cause I’m in town—just one day, now, spin round—get your face out the way
And just when she want an encore, I’m gone, Ma, sorry that I couldn’t stay—aye

[Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]
And they call me, ""O-E-double-L Ortiz,"" a.k.a., ""Yaowa""
A.k.a.—nah, nothing, I just got an AK in my jeans, can I spray your flower?
(Spray your flower) I ain't really trying to sit with you, girl
When you finish that spit, let's split, where's your wrist, let me throw this grip on you, girl, girl

[Pre-chorus: Royce Da 5'9"" + Joell Ortiz + Joe Budden]
(Aye, girl—clap that!)
She’s got it—oh, she got all the homies (Now, clap that!)
In here, excited, oh, I don't really know (If ya clap now!)
How to describe it
Before this night is a blur
Here’s my offer—that shit you did, do that with her
Then both you girls—report right here

[Chorus: Eminem + Royce Da 5'9""]
'Cause she strips to get tips (Hey!)
Those lips and those childbearing hips (I love you!)
I'll throw this—I'll throw this dick on you, girl
I'll throw this—I'll throw this dick on you, girl
Gonna make you feel me if I gotta shake this building till I make you spill drinks
Girl, this whole building is probably filled with lil' ding-a-lings

One, two, them boys coming for you
Three, four, better lock your door
Five, six, hide your bitch
(Ayo Yeezy, pop your shit!)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
They said ""thou shall not be ill, thou shall not feel
Thou should not be trill, not be drill, not be real""
Niggas selling packs, niggas flipping pills
They got heroin and cracks, man these niggas hot for real
Every year gon' be our year, every year gon' be my year
These niggas really is out here, these niggas really is out here
The block is at war, post traumatic stress
Ran up outta pills, rob that CVS
Niggas getting bust over In God We Trust
We believe in God, but do God believe in us?
If we believe enough, will we ever get to know him?
That lean got us dozing, we forget that we the chosen

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
I’ve been poppin' shit for too long
But still reppin’ where I came from

I wish you would try to play us

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I wish you would nigga, I wish you would nigga

Maybach Music

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Hunh! My money on a another level
In the streets out here I'm hotter than the fucking devil
I wonder how I got a hundred in my fucking bezel
G5, make it rain, I can change the weather
We fly, them niggas lame, where your fucking cheddar?
Aim at your brain, AK be the fucking letters
Fuck niggas fall in alphabetical order
Frank Lucas fur, the cap run more than a quarter
I’m at the fight, ringside, right next to promoters
All my niggas still hustle, consider ‘em roguish
I remember catching buses just bought me a Lotus
All your codes get decoded, know the niggas you quoting
Hunh, my corner will scorch ya, somehow my flow is the coldest
Money, power, respect, the only things truly important
Family first, Khaled we gotta stay focused
God Forgives and I Don’t, pussy niggas on notice

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I wish you would nigga, I wish you would nigga
I wish you would nigga, I wish you would nigga
Ay! I guess it’s how I came up

You see you got a couple cases, still look good nigga
You see these niggas’ll try to play ya, know how ya feel nigga
Eh yup, that’d be the day you wanna kill a nigga
But you gon' chill nigga, just for your kids nigga
Cause now there’s kids doing grown man biz nigga
You just got home nigga, you tryna live nigga
You don’t wanna do another 5 years nigga
The boss is testing yo ass, the feds’ll question yo ass
They be drug testin’ yo ass and then they pray you don’t pass
And then you look in the sky, you got some questions to ask
With no response make you wanna grab the tech and the mac

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
I’ve been poppin shit for too long

215,215,(Kissed You) Good Night,"[Verse 1]
I dropped you off
Just a little after midnight
Sat in my car
Till you turned off your porch light
I should have kissed you
I should have pushed you up against the wall
I should have kissed you
Just like I wasn’t scared at all

[Pre-Chorus]
I turned off the car
Ran through the yard
Back to your front door
Before I could knock
You turned the lock
And met me on the front porch

[Chorus]
And I kissed you
Goodnight
And now that I’ve kissed you
It’s a good night good night baby goodnight

[Verse 2]
You couldn’t see me
Watching through the window
Wondering what went wrong
Praying that you wouldn’t go
You should have kissed me
You should have pushed me up against the wall
You should have kissed me
I was right on the edge and ready to fall

[Pre-Chorus]
So I turned off the car
Ran through the yard
Back to your front door
Before I could knock, you turned the lock
And met me on the front porch

[Chorus]
And I kissed you
Goodnight
And now that I’ve kissed you
It’s a good night, good night, baby, goodnight

[Pre-Chorus]
I turned off the car
Ran through the yard
Back to your front door
Half scared to death can’t catch my breath
Aren’t these the moments we live for

[Chorus]
And I kissed you
Goodnight
And now that I’ve kissed you
It’s a good night good night baby goodnight
It’s a good night good night baby goodnight
It’s a good night good night baby goodnight
It’s a good night good night baby goodnight","['i', 'drop', 'you', 'off', 'just', 'a', 'little', 'after', 'midnight', 'sit', 'in', 'my', 'car', 'till', 'you', 'turn', 'off', 'your', 'porch', 'light', 'i', 'should', 'have', 'kiss', 'you', 'i', 'should', 'have', 'push', 'you', 'up', 'against', 'the', 'wall', 'i', 'should', 'have', 'kiss', 'you', 'just', 'like', 'i', 'wasn’t', 'scar', 'at', 'all', 'i', 'turn', 'off', 'the', 'car', 'run', 'through', 'the', 'yard', 'back', 'to', 'your', 'front', 'door', 'before', 'i', 'could', 'knock', 'you', 'turn', 'the', 'lock', 'and', 'meet', 'me', 'on', 'the', 'front', 'porch', 'and', 'i', 'kiss', 'you', 'goodnight', 'and', 'now', 'that', 'i’ve', 'kiss', 'you', 'it’s', 'a', 'good', 'night', 'good', 'night', 'baby', 'goodnight', 'you', 'couldn’t', 'see', 'me', 'watch', 'through', 'the', 'window', 'wonder', 'what', 'go', 'wrong', 'pray', 'that', 'you', 'wouldn’t', 'go', 'you', 'should', 'have', 'kiss', 'me', 'you', 'should', 'have', 'push', 'me', 'up', 'against', 'the', 'wall', 'you', 'should', 'have', 'kiss', 'me', 'i', 'be', 'right', 'on', 'the', 'edge', 'and', 'ready', 'to', 'fall', 'so', 'i', 'turn', 'off', 'the', 'car', 'run', 'through', 'the', 'yard', 'back', 'to', 'your', 'front', 'door', 'before', 'i', 'could', 'knock', 'you', 'turn', 'the', 'lock', 'and', 'meet', 'me', 'on', 'the', 'front', 'porch', 'and', 'i', 'kiss', 'you', 'goodnight', 'and', 'now', 'that', 'i’ve', 'kiss', 'you', 'it’s', 'a', 'good', 'night', 'good', 'night', 'baby', 'goodnight', 'i', 'turn', 'off', 'the', 'car', 'run', 'through', 'the', 'yard', 'back', 'to', 'your', 'front', 'door', 'half', 'scar', 'to', 'death', 'can’t', 'catch', 'my', 'breath', 'aren’t', 'these', 'the', 'moments', 'we', 'live', 'for', 'and', 'i', 'kiss', 'you', 'goodnight', 'and', 'now', 'that', 'i’ve', 'kiss', 'you', 'it’s', 'a', 'good', 'night', 'good', 'night', 'baby', 'goodnight', 'it’s', 'a', 'good', 'night', 'good', 'night', 'baby', 'goodnight', 'it’s', 'a', 'good', 'night', 'good', 'night', 'baby', 'goodnight', 'it’s', 'a', 'good', 'night', 'good', 'night', 'baby', 'goodnight']",261,Gloriana,Gloriana,2012,"[46, 39, 34, 36, 36, 40, 43, 45, 48, 51, 55, 54, 44, 72, 81, 84, 83, 85, 88, 97]",20,(Kissed You) Good Night,https://open.spotify.com/track/0Rj68IX1WqAtceUZQGk7aa,0Rj68IX1WqAtceUZQGk7aa,spotify:track:0Rj68IX1WqAtceUZQGk7aa,A Thousand Miles Left Behind,4QbCKNp0gHsKCImIdJOWos,spotify:album:4QbCKNp0gHsKCImIdJOWos,Gloriana,5RjqSn7vYk8Qb9GeLWRRhB,spotify:artist:5RjqSn7vYk8Qb9GeLWRRhB,232.903,11.0,50.0,2012-07-27,0.523,0.747,11.0,-6.125,1.0,0.0292,0.0807,0.0,0.11,0.294,118.97,"['contemporary country', 'country', 'country dawn', 'country road', 'modern country rock']",[],1.0

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Reputation for Gs, that's the role of a boss
So amazin' to see, black baguettes in my watch
She say love is for free, just expensive to shop
But it's nothin' to me, uh, that extends from my block (Ugh!)
I got a lot of figures, yeah, I'm a father figure (Me)
She know a lot of niggas, don't know a hotter nigga (Ha!)
Come to the winners circle, a lot of men will hurt you
But I'm here to nurture (For real), I wanna take you further
She got all them purses, I say in my verses
YSL and Hermès and barely scratch the surface (Ugh!)
She know on purpose (Ugh!), as I peel the curtains
I always make her nervous (Ugh!), this record's perfect

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Nicki Minaj]
(Woo-hoo, ooh)
Take it to the head, yeah, yeah
Don't think about it, be about it
Don't be scared to take it to the head, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

One shot, two shots, I'm gone (Ooh)
Now we gon' get fucked up, no excuses no apologies (Uh)

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, reputation for bustin', pussy open, it's nothin'
Big fat nigga, all that huffin' and puffin'
Take me shopping in France and he pay in advance
He got big balls, ran a play in his pants
Ran away with his money just to chill on the Island
All my bitches is stylin', beaches and eatin' Italian
This is real shit, r-r-real shit
On the real, nigga fuckin' with a real bitch

Got my eyes closed, like Asian persuasion
Fuck with me baby, it's Tunechi, baby
Buss a nut, smoke a blunt, now I'm rejuvenated
With all that pink on, bitch, I'm King Kong

Go, oh you groovy, baby

It's Mr Worldwide, Agent A, reporting live
From Cape Canaveral, MK, Big Syphe, let's ride
Back, back, in, in, time

[Chorus]
Baby
Ohhh, baby
Ohhh, baby
My sweet baby
You're the one

[Verse 1]
Miami equals
Black mask, black clothes
With a little bit of rope to tie, I flipped it
Black suits, white shirts, black glasses with a matching tie
Like Agent J or Agent K, and I wish the whole world would
Ok, I'm tryin' make a billion out of 15 cents
Understand, understood
I'm a go-getter, mover, shaker, culture
Bury a boarder, record-breaker, won't cha
Give credit where credit is due, don't cha
Know that I don't give a number two
Y'all just halfway thoughts
Not worth the back of my mind
But to understand the future
We have to go back in time

[Chorus]
Baby
Ohhh, baby
Ohhh, baby
My sweet baby
You're the one

[Verse 2]
I got the globe, yeah, in the palm of my hand
Wherever I spin it, that's where I land
Let's save the world
Men In Black, I know you understand
Stop the movement, they can try if they want to
Ignorar lo latino, si, they can try if they want to
What Pit solves is a bit raw
Took like jigsaw and built it all
Despite a big loss, I'd bet it all
And fought blind against the world, Ray Charles
Y'all just halfway thoughts
Not worth the back of my mind
But to understand the future
We have to go back in time

[Chorus]
Baby
Ohhh, baby
Ohhh, baby
My sweet baby
You're the one

[Interlude]
Let's, excuse me, baby
Go, yeah, you, baby
Back, oh you groovy, baby
In, let's make a movie, baby
Time, excuse me, baby
Let's, yeah you, baby
Go, oh you groovy, baby
Back in, let's make a movie, baby

My sweet baby
You're the...

218,218,Yuck!,"Yo
You want to speak about love
No more feelings come from that
I am nearly dead inside
And If they broke my heart
I did hurt them and one hundred more back

They say the game is about kissing ass
To get some cash and create the buzz
I am not up for this count me out you stupid fags

You do not know a shit about me trust me
I was born ambitious and real
With a sense to mark hiiistory for reeeal

My feelings were always what you call megalothymic
What now has reduced to gimmick
I had many soft spots though there are those of you you know
Don’t you, don’t you, no?

Be careful who you trust and how much invest to love
No need to attack to women betrayal is not a sex issue, fuck
Knowledge should be your tissue, yuck

But finally, I am free you give me a girl I think sex or not enough
You give me a man I see an unnecessary bromance
A supplement of love a friendship that won’t last
You give me loneliness and I see myself stronger and greater ready to unrest
I finally did embrace the power of owning yourself,yo, nothing less
Now I have to fight for the spot maybe die to become who I want
I embrace the journey if it takes pain I will torture my way to the top

And what about love? Well being great is what I want to be loved for
You claim that you are my one as only few dare to do so in the past or nor
I might still want you and me against the world I know
But, hurry cause the one side of the you and me is coming to the end yes, yes oh
It is true girl stand up or I break up with love
My emotions will turn eternally off
And I will become half monk half everything above 8 I fuck

Now listen do not confuse yourself self –release it cease it
You might afraid to take my path or maybe you are one step back
Our road won’t cross though till we both be who we supposed to be you know

Two super together me the superman and you the lois lane
Wait Em it is not rip my feelings for this relationship is old and way deep
Cause I dreamed a love that is insane

There ain't any flowers in our path
Our way is rough
Fuck it don’t suck it observe it absorb it go beyond it
Haha
Haha
I rap I am sharp
Watch it out I might snap
But for now I don’t a give a fuck

People like me get into the arena cause we want to be great but wait
We are just like the gladiators and there is always a mob
It was in a Pepsi commercial with Britney I am sure that you saw that

I roamed the world been to Africa to see what is wrong
There is no difference, difference between US ghettos and an African place
There is no difference between my town and the capital of the UK
The system has the same face it puts you in the same race

Do not get confused with those being the best and being great
It is a fake competition game
Yes, Will.I.Am I agree that the music fame
Is not the only one that should put you in the hall of fame
And yes Obama thank the fuck that you mentioned that being great
Is not only being lil wayne

But, the American dream struggles
Check it remove your goggles
Then, you will see soon
That aim for the moon
Is to be a skilful ant
That will fruitfully hunt

And what do you get in return is consuming your storage
But where is you rage?
You told me better be a tree in the west than a human being in your place
But, this is how my friend you lose the megalothymic pace

The moral imaginary instrumentally expands
There is no new aesthetic class
Do not fool you ass
Cause this will be again biopolitically fucked check your facts

What starts as an unconventional living
Ends up being satisfaction of the vague imagination of the consumerist spirit
Trust me I can write 10000 words like you write five lines
And scientifically set in flames all your brainwashing lies

But, yet hip hop culture is the only one left to save what I call great
Yo, keep having your own glorious claims
And if money is the name beat them in your own game

Yes, motherfucker dollar chains
Cause the world won’t change
But I will establish a new exchange
Dimitrios vs the world
Yes, baby game on...","['yo', 'you', 'want', 'to', 'speak', 'about', 'love', 'no', 'more', 'feel', 'come', 'from', 'that', 'i', 'be', 'nearly', 'dead', 'inside', 'and', 'if', 'they', 'break', 'my',

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Okay now Nicki, Nicki, Nicki, put it in your kidney

If I weren't rapping, I'd be trapping
If I weren't trapping, I'd be pimping
If I weren't pimping, I'd be getting it, period
I don't smoke no bobby, but my denim be from ricky
Got your girl on molly and we smokin' loud and drinkin'
Got my top back so you can see what I been thinkin'
If you know me then you know I've been thinking Franklin
Money, thousands, True Religion trousers (Tell 'em!)
Got a private home, started from them public houses (Damn)
Hair weave killer, causing her arousal (Tru)
Audi A8, told them ""outtie 5000,"" uh!

It's a mad world out here, I tell you
The world's gone stark, raving mad
Everyone in the world is mad
It's a mad crazy world

[Hook]
I see diamond-flooded demons
Lamborghini angels
Lamborghini angels

Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through
Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through

[Verse 1]
With a circle on the floor he compels them to be pure
Pulls the beast out of his heart then impales it on a sword
Writes a prayer on some paper and then he nails it to the door
Just the good of you may enter by the mercy of the lord
Listen not to what he speaks, that's been the cursing of his cause
A seduction of his senses by the devils he adores
The unholy has him hostage and his soul is now at war
Follow not his secret knowledge it will bring you no reward
Shun him while in public disallow him from your stores
Have no part in his affairs 'less his pestilence be yours
Make scoundrels of the righteous and virgins into whores
But we must still pray that his color will be cured

[Hook]

Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through
Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through

[Verse 2]
With her eyes to the ceiling and a needle in her brain
He looks back into the crowd, wipes the blood and then explains
How she slipped from this existence to the realm of the deranged
Her becoming must be halted to reverse what she became
From the looseness of her tongue, to the pollution of her aims
To do nothing is barbaric, the solution is humane
You must destroy the mind and hopefully retrain
You torture out the wildness, then replace it with the tame
Blank slate when she recovers, she won't even know her name
Perfect wife and perfect lover, no resistance, no complaints
May God bless the scientific cure for the insane
Knew she couldn't go to school, but she thought that that should change

[Hook]
I see diamond-flooded demons
Lamborghini angels

Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through
Halos down with the doors flapping when they came through

[Verse 3]
With his crucifix inside his pocket said his mission is divine
Put his Bible on the bed and then he touched on his behind
Told him take off all his clothes and put your penis next to mine
Now the little boy think it's normal because they do this all the time
With no life inside his body now he finally think he’s safe
But they cut off all his fingers while they piss all in his face
He take pictures with his killers then they sneak back to the states
Now he sit next to the picture of his wife when she was raped
With the teleprompter rolling he looks right into the lens
Doesn’t mention his redemption but absolves him of his sins
He forgives them in advance says that he will do again

[John F. Kennedy]

The sky in Cheyenne, Wyoming
Is just about as blue as it gets
And if you ain't seen a Santa Fe sunset
You ain't seen red
Texas sunflower yellow
Can take your breath away
I've seen it all, from the orange of the fall
To the green of the summer but my favorite color is

[Chorus]
Neon, the light they always leave on
A weekend on the rocks
And an old school jukebox
With a little Johnny Lee on
The buzz I love to be on
You put a double on your troubles
The light at this end of the tunnel
Is neon

[Verse 2]
The sun can do the job in the daytime
But the moon ain't quite bright enough
To light up the way to playtime
For people like us
Just like a beach side beacon
Callin' all the ships back home
A few thousand volts to cut through the smoke
The windows are tinted that's why they invented

[Chorus]
Neon, the light they always leave on

And an old school jukebox

Trying to live and love with a heart that can't be broken
Is like trying to see the light with eyes that can't be opened
Yeah, we both carry baggage we picked up on our way
So if you love me, do it gently and I will do the same

[Chorus: Shawna & Keifer Thompson]

We are fragile, we are human, we are shaped by the light we let through us

And in the darkness of this moment you see the good and bad

Sunset, riverside, four wheel drivesiIn a tail light circle
Roll down the windows, turn it on up
Pour a little crown in a dixie cup
Get the party started

Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm hmmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime

If you ain't a 10, you're a 9.9

Good God almighty

And when it gets a little bit hotter

229,229,New Day,"[Intro]
It don’t take much strength to pull a trigger
But try to get up every morning day after day and work for a living
Let’s see ‘em try that
Then we’ll see who’s the real tough guy
The working man is a tough guy

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Party people say, party people say
Ay it’s a new day, it’s a new day
World is getting ready, everybody ready, yeah!
For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Aye

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I woke up this morning thinking ’bout the old me
When I was feeling like Miller Lite and Ol' E
But now I ride on some conscious shit
I’m getting bread while I toast to my accomplishments
Only one I could have a problem with is myself
That’s probably why my only competition is myself
From today to tomorrow the Doc is just rocking the same drum
Fuck the past, though I ain’t forgot where I came from
I got the club rocking, uh
I got your girl jocking, uh
Me and Fif’ still in this bitch, bitch
We goin' the distance witchu party people, come on

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Party people say, party people say
Ayy
It’s a new day
It’s a new day
World is getting ready, everybody ready, yeah!
For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Ayy

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Now, you can get your knees on the church floor, pray it get﻿ better
Or push the dough on the liquor store, see where it get ya
But me, I got to be on top
I said, me I get to be on top
I got the street on lock
I’m on automatic pilot, ain't nobody stopping me
Growing up in poverty ain't fill my heart with larceny
Niggas ride, I don’t hide, I dump to get 'em off of me
I’m a leader, look and see the natural born boss of me
They from Bel Air, I’m from the bottom
Soon as I spot ‘em I get to drop ‘em
I got ‘em; the competition, red-dot 'em
It’s dinner time when the 9 come out
It’s off with the chain, off with the ring
Move, bang, off with ya brain

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Party people say, party people say
Ay it’s a new day, it’s a new day
World is getting ready, everybody ready, yeah!
For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Aye

[Bridge: Alicia Keys]
Marks on the wall
It’s now or never at all
I’m gonna give it my all
Whether I rise or fall

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
True story, I said I’d get rich or die trying
I did it, good luck sucker, trying to stop my shine
Nothing matters but the music, music my first love
We paper chasing -- I’m always coming in first, cuz
I’m built for it, see I’m better under pressure
I react like a maniac when I’m coming to get ya
I got to win, Em watch and Dre watch and my son watching
Fuck that, losing ain't an option
I’m sharp I’m on point
The ink from my ballpoint
Throwing out my pain
I’m back on my A-game
I’m focused, for me this is just another victory
Except that I’m stronger than an ox now mentally

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
Party people say, party people say
Ay it’s a new day, it’s a new day

I'm really out of this world
Moon, luna
Make women comfortable
Call me bloomer
Can't even show love cause they'll sue ya
But I told them, 'hallelujah, have a blessed day'
So ahead of myself
Everyday's yesterday
Want the recipe? it's real simple
Little bit of voli, and she'll open sesame

Take your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of niggas
What you following me for?
This ain't no fucking sing-along
So, girl, what you singing for?
It's cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
20, keep the bar rolling
Fake ID's in the trash, we going
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a hand full of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowing
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta cash coming straight from Poland, why? Cause

Yeah
Smoking weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know what Harvard gets us
But seeing my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times when I might blow like 50k on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
I told my story, and made history
Tell them I'ma need reservations for 20
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
Much rather spend it all while I'm breathing
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know

Well, I smoke and I fish
But not near enough to satisfy an itch
Of a girl, understand
I need something to do with my hands

[Verse 2]
I don't work, on a car
And I'm as bad at pool as I am at throwin' darts
And golf, not a fan
But I need something to do with my hands

[Chorus]
So maybe I could stick 'em in your pockets
Run 'em through your hair and we can get to rockin'
There you are, and baby, here I am
And I need something to do with my hands

[Verse 3]
I can play you a song
On this old guitar, if it turns you on
If you want, we could dance
But I need something to do with my hands

[Chorus]
So maybe I could stick 'em in your pockets
Run 'em through your hair and we can get to rockin'
There you are, and baby, here I am
And I need something to do with my hands
Go!

[Bridge]
Top off, in my jeep
And we can go for a ride and I could drive with my knees
I'll behave, best I can
But I need something to do with my hands

[Chorus]
So maybe I could stick 'em in your pockets
Run 'em through your hair and we can get to rockin'
There you are, and baby, here I am
Yeah, maybe I could stick 'em in your pockets
Run 'em through your hair and we can get to rockin'
There you are, and baby, here I am
And I need something to do with my hands
I need something to do with my hands
With my hands

233,233,Even If It Breaks Your Heart,"[Verse 1]
Way back on the radio dial
The fire got lit inside a bright-eyed child
Every note just wrapped around his soul
From steel guitars to Memphis, all the way to rock and roll

[Chorus]
Oh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear 'em singin'
""Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart""

[Verse 2]
Downtown is where I used to wander
Old enough to get there, but too young to get inside
So I would stand out on the sidewalk
Listen to the music playin' every Friday night

[Chorus]
Oh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear 'em singin'
""Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart""

[Verse 3]
Some dreams stay with you forever
Drag you around but bring you back to where you were
Some dreams keep on gettin' better
You gotta keep believin' if you wanna know for sure

[Chorus]
Oh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear 'em singin'
""Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart""
Oh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear 'em singin'

234,234,Springsteen,"[Verse 1]
To this day when I hear that song
I see you standin' there on that lawn
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip flops and cut-off jeans
Somewhere between that setting sun
I'm on Fire and Born to Run
You looked at me and I was done
And we're, we're just getting started

[Verse 2]
I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang
Oohh
Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound of you sayin' don't go

[Chorus]
When I think about you, I think about 17
I think about my old jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like the soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen

[Verse 3]
I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name I bet there'd still be a spark
Back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your mom would think
About your name on my arm

[Verse 4]
Baby, is it spring or is it summer?
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio
Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear Born in the USA
You relive those glory days
So long ago

[Chorus]
When you think about me, do you think about 17
Do you think about my old jeep
Think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
I got my mind on my money, all I need's a bad bitch
That I can run through the city spend this cash with
That I can run through this city spend this cash on
Wake up in the morning, get my smash on
I don't want much baby, egg whites
Keep your stomach and your thighs and your legs right
While I’m out here focused, getting this bread right
But if the head right, Jeezy there every night
Wake up in the morning and I'm still here
Wake up in the morning and I ain’t gone
All I ask, let me just do me
And maybe just me and you can get along
Had them other bitches mad when they seen us
Had them matching rolexes baby, team us
Yeah the earth is our turf, we can share the world
Maybe even go half on a baby girl

Let me be your mind reader, let me read your mind
And when I’m done with the front, hit it from behind
Love and loyalty, never cross the line
Just hit a nigga up when I cross your mind
Show you how to get you on, you won’t be watching mine
Put you up on a G, show you how to shine
And maybe we can kick it when I got the time
Be my backbone, every nigga need a spine
Gotta know you ride with me if I’m right or wrong
Case I wake up in the morning and it’s all gone
Best believe I’ma get it right back
That's the hustler in me, I know you like that
You probably think I’m with a different broad every night
When I think about it, shit man, you’re probably right
The more I think about it, shit, you’re probably wrong
Cause what you didn’t think about is that I'm probably grown

[Verse 3: Ne-Yo & (Young Jeezy)]
She said she wish she never met me
Cause she just can't help her let me go ahead
And do whatever the hell I want
(Do what the hell I want, nigga)
She said she hate how much she need me
Turn around and say she don’t need me
Always talking about she gonna leave me but she don’t
(She never do though, haha)
But maybe this time might be different
Cause she shed so many tears
She’ll remind me all the dumb shit
That I’ve done over the years
But she don’t be tripping in the mornings
I got her legs up by her ears
But as soon as we get done
I swear this is all I hear

I had a hand-me-down ride painted rattle-can red
Second hand tires with poor boy tread
Made a lot of almost love in the bed of that
Truck that got stuck a lot
Just letter jacket boys singing Jerry Jeff songs
Drinking everything we could get our hands on
Learning ‘bout right by doin’ it wrong
Hopin’ we didn’t get caught

[Chorus]
And we spent what little bit of money we had
On Wintergreen Skoal and main street gas
Go get your girl, go make the drag
If you’re lucky you can take her cross the railroad tracks
Where the man in the moon works his magic
On the second runner up of the 4H pageant
Seems like yesterday, even though
That was fourteen hundred and fifty two beers ago
Oh

[Verse 2]
Skipped that town on my birthday
For eighteen years I was headed that way
Where old red stopped I just stayed
In a room without a view
I met a one look girl in a two bit bar
I had a place and she had a car
I won her heart with my guitar
I sang her the homesick blues ‘bout

[Chorus]
Spendin'what little bit of money we had
On Wintergreen Skoal and main street gas
Go get your girl, go make the drag
If you’re lucky you can take her cross the railroad tracks
Where the man in the moon works his magic
On the second runner up of the 4H pageant
Seems like yesterday, even though
That was fifteen hundred and sixty two beers ago
Oh

[Chorus]
And we spent what little bit of money we had
On wintergreen Skoal and main street gas
Go get your girl, go make the drag
If you’re lucky you can take her cross the railroad tracks
Where the man in the moon works his magic
On the second runner up of the 4H pageant
Seems like yesterday, even though
That was sixteen hundred and fifty two beers
Whole lot of highway, whole lot of years
Sixteen hundred and fifty three beers ago

237,237,Runaways,"[Verse 1]
Blonde hair blowing in the summer wind
A blue-eyed girl playing in the sand
I'd been on her trail for a little while
But that was the night that she broke down and held my hand
A teenage rush
She said, ""Ain't we all just runaways? We got time""

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But that ain't much
We can't wait till tomorrow
You got to know that this is real, baby, why you want to fight it?
It's the one thing you can choose, oh!

[Verse 2]
We got engaged on a Friday night
I swore on the head of our unborn child
That I could take care of the three of us
But I got the tendency to slip when the nights get wild
It's in my blood
She said she might just runaway somewhere else
Someplace good

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We can't wait til tomorrow
You got to know that this is real, baby, why you want to fight it?
It's the one thing you can choose
Let's take a chance baby, we can't lose

[Chorus]
Ain't we all just runaways?
I knew it when I met you, I'm not going to let you runaway
I knew it when I held you, I wasn't letting go!

[Verse 3]
We used to look at the stars and confess our dreams
Hold each other till the morning light
We used to laugh, now we only fight
Baby are you lonesome now?

[Verse 4]
At night I come home after they go to sleep
Like a stumbling ghost, I haunt these halls
There's a picture of us on our wedding day
I recognize the girl but I can't settle in these walls

[Pre-Chorus 3]
We can't wait till tomorrow
Oh, we're caught up in the appeal baby, why you wanna hide it?
It's the last thing on my mind (Why you want to hide it?)
I turn the engine over and my body just comes alive

[Chorus]
Ain't we all just runaways?
I knew it when I met you, I'm not going to let you runaway
I knew it when I held you, I wasn't letting go!

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
Shake that body, party that bod-
Shake that body, party that bod-
Shake that body, party that body
Come and have a good time with G-O-D

[Verse 1: Pusha T & Kanye West]
I believe there's a God above me
I'm just the god of everything else
I put holes in everything else
""New God Flow,"" fuck everything else
Supreme dope dealer, write it in bold letters
They love a nigga's spirit like Pac at the Coachella
They said Push ain't fit with the umbrella
But I was good with the yay' as a wholeseller
I think it’s good that 'Ye got a blow dealer
A hot temper, matched with a cold killer
I came aboard for more than just to rhyme with him
Think ’99, when Puff woulda had Shyne with him, yuugh!
Matchin' Daytonas, rose gold on us
Goin' H·A·M in Ibiza done took a toll on us
But since you overdo it, I'ma pour more
Well if you goin' coupe, I’m goin' four door

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah + Kanye West]
Shake that body, party that bod- (that's rare, nigga!)
Shake that body, party that bod- (Ric Flair, nigga!)
Shake that body, party that body (yeah, nigga!)
Come and have a good time with G-O-D (yeah)
Shake that body, party that bod- (woah!)
Shake that body, party that bod- (woah!)
Shake that body, party that body (it's the new God flow, niggas)
Come and have a good time with G-O-D (yo)

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Step on they necks 'til they can’t breathe
Claim they five stars but sell you dreams
They say death multiplies by threes
Line them all up and let's just see
Fuck em 'Ye, fuck em 'Ye!
I wouldn't piss on that nigga with Grand Marnier
(Woo!) They shit is shoppin' at Targét
(Woo!) My shit is luxury Balmain (ay!)
I'm balling, Amar'e
A nick sold in the park then I want in
What's a king without a crown, nigga? (What?)
What's a circus without you clown niggas? (Hah)
What's a brick from an outta-town nigga
When you flood and you can drown niggas? (Yuuugh!)
Here's the G.O.O.D. Music golden child
M.A. dollar sign, can't nobody hold me down

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
Shake that body, party that bod-
Shake that body, party that bod-
Shake that body, party that body
Come and have a good time with G-O-D

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Hold up, I ain't trying to stunt, man
But the Yeezys jumped over the Jumpman
Went from most hated to the champion god flow
I guess that's a feeling only me and LeBron know
I'm living three dreams
Biggie Smalls', Dr. King, Rodney King's, uhh
Cause we can't get along - no resolution
'Til we drown all these haters, rest in peace to Whitney Houston
Cars, money, girls and the clothes
Aww man, you sold your soul
Naw man, mad people was frontin'
Aww man, made somethin' from nothin'
Picture workin' so hard, and you can't cut through
That can mess up your whole life, like an uncle that touched you
What has the world come to? I'm from the 312
Where cops don't come through and dreams don't come true
Like there the God go, in his Murcielago
From workin' McDonalds, barely payin' the car note
He even got enough, to get his mama a condo
Then they ran up and shot him, right in front of his mom
40 killings in a weekend, 40 killings in a week
Man, the summer too hot, you can feel it in the street
Welcome to Sunday service, if you hope to someday serve us
We got green in our eyes, just follow my Erick Sermon
Did Moses not part the water with the cane?
Did strippers not make an ark when I made it rain?
Did Yeezy not get signed by Hov and Dame?
And ran to Jacob and made the new Jesus chains?
In Jesus' name, let the choir say
""I'm on fire, ay,"" that's what Richard Pryor say
And we'll annihilate anybody that violate
Ask any dope boy you know, they admire 'Ye

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
Shake that body, party that bod-
Shake that body, party that bod-
Shake that body, party that body
Come and have a good time with G-O-D

[Interlude: Ghostface Killah]
Yeah nigga, yeah I had my, I had my Jesus piece since ‘94
I don’t know what I, I don’t know what y'all talkin’ bout
And my eagle — still got it all in the bag, B
Yeah, all I did was play possum
Yo, come on

[Verse 4: Ghostface Killah]
600 Cuban cigar in the big tub
Medallion on, Dove soap on the fresh cut
With soap suds on the MAC-11
My big lion haven’t ate since 12, and it’s after seven
We feed the nigga like 40 chickens
His tail wag when I send him a bag with just one victim
Uh-huh, now let me show you what my closet on
Gems in the display case, call it a rock-a-thon
I got soccer moms payin' for cock
Asians get it from behind while they cleanin’ their wok
Comin' with flows that is toxic
Deadly fumes when I'm in the room
Repercussions occur when you dry snitch
Red light, green light, one, two, three
Look mean, got my machine, cried and hit you, please
Say shake that body, scar up that body
Should I kill him now Tone? I said probably
Side bets are four and better
Bust hammers with pot holders
And yo, dead a cow for his fuckin' leather
I’m not bow-legged but old school like Redd Foxx
My favorite color in my hustle days was red tops
My gold eagle arm shitted out a red rock
Threw it off my project roof, saw red dots
Kanye, shine a light on my Wallabees
You can have a good time with G.O.D

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah & Kanye West]
Shake that body, party that bod- (that's rare, nigga!)
Shake that body, party that bod- (Ric Flair, nigga!)
Shake that body, party that body (yeah, nigga!)
Come and have a good time with G-O-D (yeah)
Shake that body, party that bod- (woah!)
Shake that body, party that bod- (woah!)
Shake that body, party that body (it's the new God flow, niggas)

239,239,Go Get It,"[Hook]
I gotta grind, won't stop, hustle won't quit
Shine like no other, I be on some other shit
I got a high price lifestyle, super bad bitch
If I want it, bet I got it
If I don't then all I gotta do is
Go, get It - stay about my business
Ball til I fall, floss until I'm finished
I just go, Get It - Stay about my business
I'm living just to kill it, stacking millions to the ceiling

[Verse 1]
Everyday above ground, all I wanna do is ball
Put my money over bitches, put my hustle over all
Louis down to the drawers, Louis Vuitton kicks
Got a Mad Hatter swagger, bitch I’m stupid dumb sick
With a group of young bitches and they're stupid dumb thick
I’m the marathon man, all I do is run shit
A sophisticated convict, superficial, still official
Multi-million dollar shit, money is the object
Hot shit, bitch, I got a sauna on my arm
Six figure with no diamond, Richard Mille and Vacheron
They just talk about they got it
I’m the upper echelon, though
Bitch I‘m 'bout that action, you could go on with that convo
I have done more than you dream 'bout
Got your dream bitch and your dream house
On lean passing them beans out
With a bad crew, the whole team high
Go on boy, get seen by, bro you know me, you know I be
Stacking that dough, that’s all I see
I g.o.g.e.t.i.t

[Hook]

Go, get It - stay about my business
Ball til I fall, floss until I'm finished
I just go, Get It - Stay about my business
I'm living just to kill it, stacking millions to the ceiling

[Verse 2]
I live life, fuck late night
Get shitfaced when I take flight
I get paid, no sick days
My outfit’s on switch blade
Don’t sniff yay, but I blow dro
Bank roll on loco
Still ride with that fo'-fo'
Don’t let my P-O know
Bad white bitch super thick
I’m Ice T, she Coco
She got another bitch, them other bitches
Her ass fat, face so-so, no paper trail
No phone call, no emails, no photos
Just backshot, with that fat butt
And low blow headbutts in slow-mo
A Purple label, Polo and Akoo, that’s all I do
Man I Striver Row my denim in my new Margiela shoes
Man, we be cool if we just parle, on Margharita Molly
And the strongest pack around bumpin' Sade out in Maui
We menagin’ for a hobby
We kick it how we kick it
Know you envy how I’m living
Chicks just can’t resist this pimping
Get the million 'bout my business
Bro you know me, you know I be
Stacking that dough that’s all I see
I g.o.g.e.t.i.t

241,241,How We Do (Party),"[Intro]
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit
And party, and party

[Verse 1]
I stumble up to the window
Opened the curtains to blinding lights
Make up all over the pillow
What went on? What went on?
What went on last night?
You look so sweet while you're dreaming (Yeah)
Holding your bottle of Tanqueray (Yeah)
It isn't even the weekend
Baby, that's how I know you're the one for me

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna party and bullshit (How we do)
And party and bullshit
And party and bullshit (How we do)
And party, and party

[Chorus]
'Cause when the sun sets, baby
On the avenue
I get that drunk sex feeling
Yeah, when I'm with you
So put your arms around me, baby
We're tearing up the town
'Cause that's just how we do
We got that sweet, hot loving
Dancing in the dark
Out in the streets, we're running
Shut down every bar
So put your arms around me, baby
We're tearing up the town
'Cause that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do
How we do, that's just how we do

[Verse 2]
Hungover, I think I'm broken
You say the fix is a shot of Jack
I said, ""Man, what are you smokin'?""

I get that drunk sex feeling
Yeah, when I'm with you
So put your arms around me, baby
We're tearing up the town
'Cause that's just how we do
We got that sweet, hot loving
Dancing in the dark
Out in the streets, we're running
Shut down every bar
So put your arms around me, baby
We're tearing up the town

Days like this, I want to drive away
Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade
You chewed me up and spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light, you drained me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

[Chorus]
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you’re not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you’re never gonna ever take away from me, no

I just wanna throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me
You ripped me off, your love was cheap
Was always tearing at the seams
I fell deep, you let me drown

A firework, a dancing flame
You won’t ever put me out again

It don't mean nothing anyway
In fact you can keep everything
Yeah yeah, except for me

I lit up their December nights like the Fourth of July, vanilla sky
Thrilla in Manila, knocking them out like Pacquiao
No Ali, no Frazier, but for now it's off to Malaysia
Two passports, three cities, two countries, one day
Now that's worldwide, if you think it's a game, let's play, dale

I am what they thought I'd never become
I believed and became it
Now I'm here to claim it
I hustle anything, you name it, name it
I went from eviction to food stamps
To baggin' work, wet and damp
To a passport, flooded with stamps
Now it's Voli everywhere I land
Two passports, three cities, two countries, one day
Now that's worldwide, if you think it's a game, let's play, dale

It all comes down to this
I miss your morning kiss
I won't lie, I'm feeling it
You're gone now, and I'm missing it
I'm so dumb, I must admit
It's too much to hold it in
I can't say no more than this
I just hope your heart hear me now

[Pre-Chorus 1: Nicki Minaj]
Gotta let you know how I'm feeling
You own my heart, he just renting
Don't turn away, pay attention
I'm pouring out my heart, oh, boy

You know the one
Right around the block from the nice place that you love to shop
Can you get away?

One-on-one, without a crowd
I wanna hold your hand, make you laugh again
I need to be near you

It, it, it, it, it ain't your spit game, it's your dick game
That got me walkin' 'round ready to wear your big chain
I only argue with him when the Lakers on
Other than that, I'm gettin' my Marc Jacobs on
Man, my pussy game so cold, that he always seem to come back
'Cause he know that it be a rap, when I'm ridin' it from the back
Wait, oh, let me see your phone 'cause all them bitches is ratchet
And don't let me get in my truck; 'cause all them bitches will catch it
Wait-we-we-we-we-we-wait, damn, there I go again
I be trippin', I be flippin', I be so belligerent
Man, the shit that we be fightin' over so irrelevant
I don't even remember, though I was probably hella bent (let's go, let's go)

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & Chris Brown]
I, I'm not livin' life

246,246,Drank In My Cup,"[Produced by Sound M.O.B.]

[Verse 1]
I done came down, hold up
Grip the grain, roll up
And your girlfriend want a nigga like me
Cause I ain't tryin' to control her
She call me when she wants a change
Black diamond, my pinky ring
And she know you weak and we ain't the same
You hit the scene, I make the scene
I'm in her head like Maybelline
H-Town so I'm made for lean
I'm in her soul, I make her scream
I don't ride the toll, don't pay the change
I'm EZ tag like Peter Pan
She want a man, don't need a man
I'm flying down your boulevard
She cookin' dinner with your pans
Draped up, dripped out
Your bitch know what I'm taking 'bout
Pulls up, pull out
We get it poppin' in the parking lot
She like to do it with the lights on
Don't matter to me if it's dark or not
I'm G'd up, East up
Fossil pants, I'm hard as rock

[Hook]
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that don't really need you
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that ain't trying to keep
You heard what I said, that could put you to bed
That ain't tryin' to love you baby, just fuck you instead
And don't tell 'em nothing baby, you know that I'm comin' baby
Just hit up my phone whenever you need you some company
Got this drank in my cup, oh yeah
I got this drank in my cup
I got this drank in my cup, cup, cup

[Verse 2]
I done came down, came up
Slow pitch, change up
Same hood, same style, same drink, same cup
She call me when she wanna fuck
I never call, she knows what's up
Same page, same book, different song, same hook
Everytime her nigga trippin', she on the phone with the same crook
And everytime I pull up, she hit me with that same look
Lips bitin', hips right
She left her man for that get right
I'm in the middle, like midnight
Only if you got that sit tight
Only if you got that wine fine
Only if you got that sip type
Only if you got that mind bomb
Only if you got that zip tight
Eat that shit like wonton
Jokin' baby, I'm pimp tight
I'm used to bein' that one and done
But girl you got that g-get right

[Hook]
[Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that don't really need you
Girl I know how much you really want somebody

247,247,Take Care,"[Refrain: Rihanna]
I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost

[Couplet 1: Drake]
I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know
We know, they won't get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all on the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste
Pushing me away so I give her space
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
When the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry, you won't ever have to hide
If you've seen all my mistakes so look me in my eyes

[Refrain]

[Couplet 2: Drake]
It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you but I'll lie if I have to
Cause you don't say you love me to your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do .. You do
One time been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights, so don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know
We know you hate being alone and you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you something
To save you .. instead they say:

[Interlude: Gil Scott-Heron]
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true

Where are you now
When I need you around?
I'm on my knees
But it seems we're

[Chorus]
Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax

[Verse 2]
I gave my best, it wasn't enough
You get upset, we argue too much
We made a mess of what used to be love
So why do I care, I care at all
At all
At all, at all

[Chorus]
Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax

[Bridge]
You say it's better if we
Love each other separately
I just need you one more time
I can't get what we had out my mind
Where are you now
When I need you around?
I'm on my knees
But it seems we're going

[Chorus]
Nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax

Hey old friend, thanks for callin'
It's good to know somebody cares
Yeah she's gone, but I don't feel like talkin'
It might be just too much to bear
To hear somebody say it stops hurting
Or to hear somebody say she ain't worth it

'Cause you don't know her like I do
You'll never understand
You don't know we've been through

No, you don't know how much I've got to lose
You don't know her like I do

I can't forget, I'm drowning in these memories
It fills my soul with all the little things
And I can't cope, it's like a death inside the family

Don't try to tell me she ain't worth it

But he’s gonna leave you crying with your heart in the dirt
His lips are dripping honey, but he’ll sting you like a bee
So lock up all your love and go and throw away the key

Get out while you can

You want a white wedding and a hand you can hold

Want a fairytale ending, somebody to love
But he’s really good at lying
Yeah, he’ll leave you in the dust

From New York to Los Angeles
Kinda making small talk killing time
Flirting with the flight attendants
Thirty-thousand feet above, could be Oklahoma

[Verse 2]
Just a bunch of square cornfields and wheat farms
Man, it all looks the same
Miles and miles of back roads and highways
Connecting little towns with funny names
Who'd want to live down there in the middle of nowhere?

[Verse 3]
They've never drove through Indiana
Met the men who plowed that earth
Planted that seed, busted his ass for you and me
Or caught a harvest moon in Kansas
They'd understand why God made
Those flyover states

[Verse 4]
I bet that mile long Santa Fe freight train engineer's seen it all
Just like that flatbed cowboy stacking US steel on a 3-day haul
Roads and rails under their feet
Yeah that sounds like a first class seat

On the plains of Oklahoma
With a windshield sunset in your eyes
Like a water-colored painted sky

You'll think heaven's doors have opened
You'll understand why God made
Those flyover states

Take a ride across the badlands
Feel that freedom on your face
Breathe in all that open space
And meet a girl from Amarillo
You'll understand why God made
You might even wanna plant your stakes
In those flyover states

I'm afraid that I gotta do what I gotta do
But if I let you go, where you gonna go?
We gotta make a change, time to turn the page
Something isn't right, I don't wanna fight you
We've been through tougher times, you know it gets worse
We can turn this around, please let me be first
And as I feel your tears spilling on my shirt
Something isn't right and I don't wanna fight you

[Chorus]
Hey you, come over and let me embrace you
I know that I'm causing you pain too
But remember if you need to cry
I'm here to wipe your eyes
Tonight, before you fall asleep
I run my thumb across your cheek (across your cheek)
Cry, 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes
I know I made you feel this way
You gotta breathe, we'll be okay (be okay)
Cry, 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes

Oh, oh, 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes

When did we cross the line? How could we could forget
Why did we let the pressure get into our heads?
Your broken heart requires all of my attention
'Cause something isn't right, I don't wanna fight you

Hey you, come over and let me embrace you
I know that I'm causing you pain too
But remember if you need to cry

Cry, 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes
I know I made you feel this way
You gotta breathe, we'll be okay (be okay)
Cry, 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes

257,257,Lost In The Echo,"[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, yo

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
You were that foundation
Never gonna be another one, no
I followed, so taken
So conditioned, I could never let go

Then sorrow, then sickness
Then the shock when you flip it on me
So hollow, so vicious
So afraid, I couldn't let myself see

That I could never be held
Back or up, no, I hold myself
Check the rep, yep, you know mine well
Forget the rest, let them know my Hell

There and back, yet my soul ain't sell
Kept respect up, the best they fell
Let the rest be the tale they tell
That I was there, saying

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In these promises broken, deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So, one last lie I can see through
This time, I finally let you go, go, go

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Test my will, test my heart
Let me tell you how the odds gonna stack up
Y'all go hard, I go smart
How's that working out for y'all in the back, huh?

I've seen that, frustration
Been crossed and lost and told no
And I've come back, unshaken
Let down and lived and let go

So, you can let it be known
I don't hold back, I hold my own
I can't be mapped, I can't be cloned
I can't C-flat, it ain't my tone

I can't fall back, I came too far
Hold myself up and love my scars
Let the bells ring wherever they are
'Cause I was there, saying

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In these promises broken, deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So, one last lie I can see through
This time, I finally let you go!

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
No, you can tell 'em all now
I don't back up, I don't back down
I don't fold up and I don't bow
I don't roll over, don't know how

I don't care where the enemies are
Can't be stopped, all I know, go hard
Won't forget how I got this far
For every time, saying

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
In these promises broken deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo

You shine just like the sun while the moon and the stars reflect your light
Beauty revolves around you, it's only right that

261,261,Somethin' 'Bout A Truck,"[Verse 1]
There's somethin' 'bout a truck in a farmer's field
A ""No trespass"" sign, and time to kill
Nobody's gonna get hurt, so what's the big deal?
There's somethin' 'bout a truck in a farmer's field

[Verse 2]
And there's somethin' 'bout beer sitting on ice
After a long hard day, makes it taste just right
On that dropped tailgate on a summer night
There's somethin' 'bout beer sittin' on ice

[Verse 3]
And there's somethin' 'bout a girl in a red sundress
With an ice cold beer pressed against her lips
In that farmer's field (Hah), will make a boy a mess
There's somethin' 'bout a girl in a red sundress

[Verse 4]
And there's somethin' bout a kiss that's gonna lead to more
On that dropped tailgate, back behind the corn
The most natural thing you've ever felt before
There's somethin' 'bout a kiss that's gonna lead to more

[Chorus]
And there's somethin' 'bout a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
Begging for another kiss
And there's somethin' 'bout you and me and the birds and the bees
And Lord have mercy, it's a beautiful thing
Ain't nothing 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck

[Verse 5]
There's somethin' 'bout a creek around 2 AM
After a few of those beers, you wanna dive on in
You don't need no clothes, so just hang 'em on a limb
There's somethin' 'bout a creek around 2 AM

[Chorus]
And there's somethin' 'bout a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
Begging for another kiss
And there's somethin' 'bout you and me and the birds and the bees
And Lord have mercy it's a beautiful thing
Ain't nothing 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck
Ain't nothing 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck

262,262,Set Fire To The Rain,"[Produced by Fraser T Smith]

[Verse 1]
I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

[Pre-Chorus]
But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

[Verse 2]
When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing is better

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time

[Bridge]
Sometimes, I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you

[Chorus]
I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time

[Outro]

263,263,No Hurry,"[Verse 1]
You know my old car needs washing
And the front yard needs a trim
And the telephone keeps ringing
And the bossman knows I know its him
And the bills aren't going to pay themselves
Don't matter anyway
Cause I ain't in no hurry today
There's nothing wrong with an old cane fishing pole
And the smell of early spring
Sit down in a fold-up easy chair
On a quiet shady river bank
Let the world go on without me
Wouldn't have it any other way
Cause I ain't in no hurry today

[Chorus]
Ain't in no hurry
I'd be a fool now to worry
About all those things I can't change
And the time that I borrow
Can wait until tomorrow
Cause I ain't in no hurry today

[Bridge]
When I must return
To the cold cold ground
Have them take their time
When they lay this sinner down

[Verse 2]
Heaven knows that I ain't perfect
I've raised a little cain
And I plan to raise a whole lot more
Before I hear those angels sing
(Going to get right with the lord)
But there'll be hell to pay
But I'm in no hurry

[Chorus]
Ain't in no hurry
I'd be a fool now to worry
About all those things I can't change
And the time that I borrow
Can wait until tomorrow

266,266,So Good,"[Verse 1]
Drinking a German beer, with a Cuban cigar
In the middle of Paris with a Dominican broad
Great head on her shoulders, she probably studied abroad
She transferred to Harvard from King's College in March
She says that I'm her favorite 'cause she admires the art
Michelangelo with the flow, Picasso with the bars
She's well put together like a piece by Gershwin
Renaissance style, tonight is picture perfect, so smile
And pack your bags real good, baby
'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, tell me how you feel, what's your fantasy oh
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up, be my señorita
We ain't gotta rush just take it slow
You'll be in the high life, soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want is yours
I'll have you living life like you should
You say you never had it so good

[Chorus]
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
You never had it so good
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la

Suffering from first class cabin fever
Five hour layovers from Norway to Egypt
I'm to the point like the pyramids of Giza
Still I'm to the left like the tower out in Pisa
I'm feeling single baby, I could use a feature
Swagger like Caesar, I'll get you a visa
We can go to Italy and maybe see the Colosseum
I'll be Da Vinci if you'll be my Mona Lisa, now smile
So pack your bags real good, baby
'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, tell me how you feel, what's your fantasy oh
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up, be my señorita
We ain't gotta rush just take it slow
You'll be in the high life, soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want is yours
I'll have you living life like you should
You say you never had it so good

[Chorus]
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
You never had it so good
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
You never had it so good

[Verse 3]
Well I been feeling singular, how 'bout let's make it plural
Spin the globe, wherever it lands that's where we'll go
We'll hit up Europe, yep, and spend some Euros
And maybe visit Berlin, the walls with the murals
This is your month baby, sign of the Virgo
Private reservations, glasses full of Merlot
A Rosé, a Burgundy, traveling like turbo
Brush up on your Español, we're Barcelona-bound, so smile
So pack your bags real good, baby
'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, tell me how you feel, what's your fantasy oh
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up, be my señorita
We ain't gotta rush just take it slow
You'll be in the high life, soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want is yours
I'll have you living life like you should
You say you never had it so good

[Chorus]
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
You never had it so good
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
You never had it so good
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la

267,267,Rumour Has It,"[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
She, she ain't real
She ain't gon' be able to love you like I will
She is a stranger
You and I have history, or don't you remember?
Sure, she's got it all
But baby, is that really what you want?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
She made a fool out of you
And boy, she's bringing you down
She made your heart melt, but you're cold to the core
Now rumour has it, she ain't got your love anymore

[Chorus]
Rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)

[Verse 2]
She is half your age
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you strayed
I heard you've been missing me
You've been telling people things you shouldn't be
Like when we creep out when she ain't around
Haven't you heard the rumours?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
(Bless your soul)
Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of me
And boy, you're bringing me down
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core
But rumour has it, I'm the one you're leaving her for

[Chorus]
Rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)

[Bridge]
All of these words whispered in my ear
Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear
Just 'cause I said it, it don't mean that I meant it
People say crazy things
Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it
Just 'cause you heard it

[Chorus]
Rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)
But rumour has it (rumours)

I'll 'nail' it, 'hammer' time, but you fuckers cannot 'stop' this
Man of 'Steal' up in this ho like I fuck her, never 'bought this.'
I got this, got your fuckin' daughter screamin' I'm the hottest
I 'fuckin' make it 'Rainn', like I'm 'cummin' out 'The Office.'
The rawest and that's a fact, you 'sleep' on me, you're 'lying.'
You changed your true colors, bitch, but somehow you're not 'dying.'
You wanna be the next big thing, but you rappers are not trying
Why the fuck would I stay grounded when I could be flying?
Defying gravity, blessed like I got allergies
Got these motherfuckers mad at me, cause the way I casually ravage beats
This is far from ""average, neat,"" you rap lames fucking lack this heat
Like the way that I attack this beat and the high rate of them casualties!
Fatality, bitch, and I'm coming to your families
Motherfuck reality, y'can catch me in your galaxy
Disregard formalities, a savage beast on wild beats!
The real walking 'paradox,' you can call me 'Kyle Reese!'

[Verse 2:]
The only reason I can rap is cause I have no fucking life
I used that shit to my advantage, like a lying user wife
All I do is watch Netflix, blog, eat, homework, and fucking write
You can call me 'SOPA,' cause I'll destroy all that is on 'site!'
Oh my Zod, he's fucking clever, find someone that can spit better
Bet I sever, never better. Alec's on a hard endeavor
Under weather, yes, I'm sick. ""Shut the fuck up, with that sick bull shit
Every song you mention it. You sound like you are full of it.""
I keep my head held high, I guess that's why I'm stuck up
Your porno's on, your parents here, mute that so shut the fuck up!
Catch me up in Asgard asking Odin, ""What's up?""
While I got villains in the corner coughing blood up
A child? Please, I guess that's true, but I like the way I'm wilding
I'm a fucking 'square,' I'm 'groundbreaking,' it is like I'm 'tiling'
I defile beats, just smile please, need clean up here at aisle three!

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Yes I can, doubt better leave, I'm runnin' with this plan
Pull me, grab me, crabs in the bucket can't have me
I'll be the president one day
January first, oh, you like that gossip?
Like you the one drinking what God sip—dot com
Now I gotta word for your tongue
How many rolling stones you want?
Yeah I got a brand new spirit
Speaking it and it's done
Woke up on the side of the bed like I won
Talk like a winner, my chest to that sun
G5 dealer, U.S. to Taiwan
Now who can say that? I wanna play back
Mama knew I was a needle in a hay stack
A Bugatti boy, plus Maybach
I got a feeling it's a rap, ASAP

[Chorus: Etta James & Flo Rida]

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
The mountain top, walk on water
I got power, feel so royal
One second I'ma strike all you
Diamond, platinum, no more for you
Got adrenaline, never giving in
Giving up's not an option, gotta get it in
Witness, I got the heart of 20 men
No fear, go to sleep in the lion's den
That flow, that spark, that crown
You looking at the king of the jungle now
Stronger than ever, can't hold me down
A hundred miles gunning from the pitcher's mound
Straight game face, it's game day
See me running through the crowd full of melee
No trick plays, I'm Bill Gates, take a genius to understand me

Pick up lines, I just dropped mine
Single for the night, tryna double my funds

And her hair long, I'mma grab it
She call me daddy, but I'm a bastard

Or tryna take care of you, so put your bad habit

272,272,Die In Your Arms,"[Intro]
Mhmm, uh-huh, yeah yeah, alright
Mhmm, uh-huh, yeah yeah, alright

[Verse 1]
Say you love me as much as I love you, yeah
Would you hurt me, baby?
Could you do that to me, yeah?
Would you lie to me, baby?
Cause the truth hurts so much more
Would you do the things that drive me crazy?
Leave my heart still at the door?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I can't help it I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly, the truth is...

[Chorus]
If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
Cause everytime you touch me I just die in your arms
Ooh, it feels so right
So baby, baby, please don't stop, girl

[Interlude]
Ooh, baby I know loving you ain't easy
(Mhmm, uh-huh, yeah yeah, alright)
But it sure is worth a try
(Mhmm, uh-huh, yeah yeah, alright)

[Verse 2]
Ooh, if there is a reason to call me a fool
Cause I love too hard
Are there any rules, baby?
If this is a lesson, then baby, teach me to behave
Just tell me what I gotta do just to stay right next to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I can't help it I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly, the truth is

[Chorus]
If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
Cause everytime you touch me I just die in your arms
Ooh, it feels so right
So baby, baby, please don't stop, girl

[Bridge]
Basically, I'm staying here
I can't live without my baby
Loving you is so damn easy for me, yeah
Ain't no need for contemplating
Promise you won't keep me waiting
Tell me, baby, I'm all that you need

[Chorus]
If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
Cause everytime you touch me I just die in your arms
Ooh, it feels so right
So baby, baby, please don't stop, girl
If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
Cause everytime you touch me I just die in your arms
Ooh, it feels so right
So baby, baby, please don't stop, girl

[Outro]
If I could die in your arms
I'ma make you believe girl
I wouldn't mind
Ay ay ay, oh
Don't stop, baby, no
It's what you do to me, yeah
Woah, no no no, ooh woah

Did you know that you could be wrong
And swear you’re right?
Some people been known to do it
All their lives
But you find yourself alone
Just like you found yourself before
Like I found myself in pieces
On the hotel floor
Hard times help me see

[Chorus]
I’m a good man with a good heart
Had a tough time, got a rough start
But I finally learned to let it go
Now I’m right here, and I’m right now
And I’m hoping, knowing somehow
That my shadow days are over
My shadow days are over now

[Verse 2]
Well I'm no trouble maker
And I never meant her harm
But it doesn’t mean I didn’t make it
Hard to carry on
Well it sucks to be honest (honest)
And it hurts to be real
But it's nice to make some love
That I can finally feel
Hard times let me be

[Chorus]
I’m a good man with a good heart
Had a tough time, got a rough start
But I finally learned to let it go

274,274,Fine By Me,"[Verse 1]
You're not the type, type a girl
To remain with a guy, with a guy too shy too afraid
To say he'll give his heart to you forever
I'm not the boy who will fall to his knees
With his hands clasped tight beggin' beggin' you please
To stay with him for worse or for better

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm staring at you now
There's no one else around
I'm thinking you're the girl for me

[Chorus]
I'm just saying it's fine by me
If you never leave
And we can lay like this forever
It's fine by me

[Veres 2]
In the past I would try try hard to commit to a girl
Wouldn't get too far
It always somehow seemed to fall apart
But with you, you, you I can see what I need
I can dream realistically
I knew that this was different from the start
And it seems that every time we're eye to eye
I can find another piece of you, that I don't wanna lose

And I'm staring at you now
There's no one else around
I'm thinking you're the girl I need

And it's never easy
But darling, believe me
I'm as skeptical as you
But when I think of life without us
It seems like what we're supposed to do
But I don't wanna come on too strong

I'm just saying it's fine by me

And we can lay like this forever

Bussing down them Benjamins, fuck it up on Louis kicks

Drinking on that Actav', then it tasting like some bubble gum
Thumbing through the check, boarding on a jet
Talking on the iPhone, sipping out the styrofoam
That dirty got my mind gone, that money got my mind blown
VVS and white stones, VVS and white stones

Got that Gambino jumping out the gym
My young nigga serving J's outside Crim
Jumping 'cross me, you know your chances slim
In my aviator Gucci like I'm driving planes
When the cash hit cash money, smell like cocaine
Doing Birdman numbers, making flips like Jackie Chan
Walk inside the jeweler, jumping bail on your ring
Spent so much on Louie, gave me free champagne
In Bal Harbour shopping and they doing the same thing
And I keep my cup with me like a pimp
I think I'm Magic Don Juan, take a glimpse
Spike Lee need to get this shit on film

276,276,Banjo,"[Verse 1: Gary]
When I lose my smile
When my thoughts get jumbled
When the air and BS get too thick
Can’t take a breath
Without getting sick
I’ve had enough
With this concrete jungle
I drop my truck in drive
I pick up my baby
She jumps in with a kiss and a hey
We exit off that old highway
Sometimes you gotta go
Beyond the pavement

[Chorus]
You gotta go deep
Way on back
Cross a few creeks
And a couple little shacks
You gotta get lost
Way on out
Crickets and frogs
Yeah you’re gettin’ close now
And you kick it into four wheel drive
When you run out of road
And you go, and you go and you go-go-go
‘Til you hear a banjo

[Verse 2: Gary]
It ain’t on no map
And I’m glad it isn’t
Leave the phone
And the GPS
Those satellites
Ain’t found it yet
Got our own little
Piece of heaven hidden

[Chorus x3]
You gotta go deep
Way on back
Cross a few creeks
And a couple little shacks
You gotta get lost
Way on out
Crickets and frogs
Yeah you’re gettin’ close now
And you kick it into four wheel drive
When you run out of road
And you go, and you go and you go-go-go

278,278,Better Than I Used To Be,"[Verse 1]
I know how to hold a grudge
I can send a bridge up in smoke
And I can't count the people I've let down, the hearts I've broke
You ain't gotta dig too deep
If you wanna find some dirt on me
I'm learning who you've been
Ain't who you've got to be
It's gonna be an uphill climb
Aw honey I won't lie

[Chorus]
I ain't no angel
I still got a few more dances with the devil
I’m cleaning up my act little by little
I’m getting there
I can finally stand the man in the mirror I see
I ain’t as good as I’m gonna get
But I’m better than I used to be

[Verse 2]
I’ve pinned a lot of demons to the ground
I’ve got a few old habits left
But there’s still one or two I might need you to help me get
Standing in the rain so long has left me with a little rust
But put some faith in me
And someday you’ll see
There’s a diamond under all this dust

[Chorus]
I ain't no angel
I still got a few more dances with the devil
I’m cleaning up my act little by little
I’m getting there
I can finally stand the man in the mirror I see
I ain’t as good as I’m gonna get
But I’m better than I used to be

[Chorus]
I ain't no angel
I still got a few more dances with the devil
I’m cleaning up my act little by little
I’m getting there

280,280,Drink On It,"[Verse 1]
Hey girl, hey where you going?
Come back and sit back down
You look too good to be heading home so early now
You say you got to work tomorrow
Got a lot on your mind
Let me buy another round
Girl I think you and I should just

[Chorus]
Drink on it
Put our heads together and think on it
Maybe later on we can sleep on it
But for right now
Girl we just need to drink on it

[Verse 2]
We can talk rocket science
Jesus or politics
How your boyfriend cheated on you
Man he sounds like such a prick
I could use another whiskey
And your Cosmo's getting low
While we're trying to figure out
The next place we should go

[Chorus]
We can drink on it
Put our heads together and think on it
Maybe later on we can sleep on it
But for right now
Girl we just need to drink on it

[Verse 3]
This place is closing down
But I don't want to quit
Got to good thing going girl
Let's find out what it is

[Chorus]
And drink on it
Your place or mine
Girl we can drink on it
Dust off a bottle and drink on it
Feels like we're doing something right
Let's find a corner of the night
Where you and I can just drink on it
Put our heads together and think on it
Maybe later on we can sleep on it
But for right now
Girl we just need to drink on it

[Bridge]
Might make a memory that we won't forget

282,282,Around My Way (Freedom Ain't Free),"[Produced by Simonsayz and B Sides; Additional production by Lupe Fiasco and Chill]

[Verse 1]
First off, say ""Peace"" to Pine Ridge
Shame at all the damage that the white man wine did
Ghost Dance, Trail of Tears, five million beers a year
And all that other crime did
More peace to the teachers of blind kids
To rebels in small cells keeping their mind big
Say everything's hostile
Suicide bombers and prosperity gospels, emaciated models
With cocaine and blood pouring out their nostrils, they got to
Just to stay awake on the catwalk of life where everybody watch you
Straight hair, high heels and a handbag
Crucifixes, racism and a land grab
Katrina, FEMA trailers, human body sandbags
A peace sign and a pants sag
A money toss cause a nine stripper mad dash
A friend request following a hash tag
Now everybody want it like the last laugh
A Michael Jackson jacket or a Daft mask
Purple Jordans or the mixed girl in your math class
Stable is when the Ba'ath had Baghdad
But corporate jets really had to have that gas bad
War and they hope they all fall from the ratatat
Cause that's just more dinosaur for their Cadillacs

[Hook]
Live from the other side what you see
A bunch of nonsense on my TV
Heaven on Earth is what I need
But I feel I'm in Hell every time I breathe
Reporting live from the other side what you hear
A bunch of nonsense all in my ear
Rich man, poor man, we all gotta pay
Cause freedom ain't free, especially 'round my way

[Verse 2]
And we marvel at the state of Ottoman
Then turn around and treat Ghana like a garbage can
America's a big motherfuckin' garbageman
If you ain't know, you're part and parcel of the problem
You say no you ain't, and I say yes you is
Soon as you find out what planned obsolescence is
You say no they didn't, and I say yes they did
The definition of unnecessary-ness
Manifested
Say that we should protest just to get arrested
That goes against all my hustling ethics
A bunch of jail niggas say it's highly ineffective
Depart from Martin, connect on Malcolm X tip
Insert Baldwin, the similar, the separate
To me, the truth is more fulfilling than a meth hit
Or finding really fast internet to have some sex with
It's all one song short of a set list
Couple croissants shy of a continental breakfast
Or blowing out your birthday candles just to make a death wish
So absurd, word to Chief Bone Necklace
Down at the Lakota Sioux Casino
A whole culture boiled down to giving you pokeno
I go as left as a heart in the chest
Cause the Horn of Africa is now starving to death

[Hook]
Live from the other side what you see
A bunch of nonsense on my TV
Heaven on Earth is what I need
But I feel I'm in Hell every time I breathe
Reporting live from the other side what you hear
A bunch of nonsense all in my ear
Rich man, poor man, we all gotta pay
Cause freedom ain't free, especially 'round my way

[Verse 3]
An all-white Los Angeles, the dream of Mr. Chandler
Hope and pray they take Columbus Day up off the calendar
South Central an example of God's gifts
So shout to all the mothers raising babies in SPA 6
The projects of Oakland city, Detroit ghost towns
Monopolies on poverty where D-boy coke bound
It’s parts of Manila like the video for ""Thriller""
But the US Embassy is reminiscent of a villa
If poverty is chocolate and privilege vanilla
Then what’s the flavor of the Sunday preacher’s pedophilia?
Cash rules everything around these niggas
As classrooms everywhere around me wither
Hither you can be Mr. Burns or Mr. Smithers
The tyrant or the slave, but nowhere in the middle
Of the extremes of America’s dream
Freud fighting Neo, Freddy Krueger refereeing, now…

[Hook]
Live from the other side what you see
A bunch of nonsense on my TV
Heaven on Earth is what I need
But I feel I'm in Hell every time I breathe
Reporting live from the other side what you hear
A bunch of nonsense all in my ear
Rich man, poor man, we all gotta pay
Cause freedom ain't free, especially 'round my way

Is this thing on? Word

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We’re just having fun
We don’t care who sees
So what we go out?
That’s how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
So what I keep ‘em rolled up?
Saggin’ my pants, not caring what I show
Keep it real with my niggas
Keep it player for these hoes
It look clean, don't it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501 jeans on it
Roll joints bigger than King Kong’s fingers
And smoke them hoes down ’til they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day
I’m with your bitch smokin’ grade A

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
You know what?
It’s like I’m 17 again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin’, on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh my god, I’m on the chase, Chevy
It's gettin’ kinda heavy, relevant, sellin’ it
Dippin’ away, time keeps slippin’ away
Zip in the safe, flippin’ for pay
Tippin’ like I’m drippin’ in paint
Upfront, four blunts, like, “Khalifa put the weed in a J”

We don’t care who sees
So what we go out?

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa & Snoop Dogg]
And I don't even care
Cause if me and my team in there
There's gonna be some weed in the air
Tell 'em Mac
Blowin' everywhere we goin' and now you knowin'
When I step right up, get my lighter so I can light up
That's how it should be done
Soon as you thinkin' you're down
Find how to turn things around
Now things are lookin' up
From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thang
Now I'm chillin', fresh outta class, feelin'
Like I'm on my own and I could probably own a building
Got my own car, no job, no children
Had a science project, me and Mac killed it
T-H-C, M-A-C, D-E-V, H-D-3, high as me
This is us, we gon' fuss
And we gon' fight and we gon' roll
And live off life

We don’t care who sees
So what we go out?

Yea, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you’re supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun
So we just, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you’re supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun

Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo

[Verse 1]
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep
And dreamed of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes

[Interlude]
Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo

[Verse 2]
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth
Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear, a waterfall
In the night, the stormy night, she'll close her eyes
In the night, the stormy night, away she'd fly

[Chorus 1]
And dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
She'd dream of para-para-paradise

[Bridge]
La-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la
So lying underneath those stormy skies
She'd say, ""Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
I know the sun must set to rise""

[Chorus 2]
This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be para-para-paradise
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
This could be para-para-paradise

This could be para-para-paradise

288,288,Ass Back Home,"[Intro: Travie McCoy]
Oh, it's so sexy, yo

[Chorus: Neon Hitch & Travie McCoy]
I don't know where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door (Ya)
For one more chance to hold you close
(It's your boy Travie, Gym Class Heroes)
I don't know where you're going (Let's go, yeah)
Just get your ass back home

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
We both knew this type of life didn't come with instructions (No)
So I'm trying to do my best to make something out of nothing
And sometimes it gets down right shitty in fact
When you call and I don't even know what city I'm at
Or what day of the week in the middle of the month
In a year I don't recall
It's like my life's on repeat and the last time we spoke I told you I wouldn't be long
That was last November now December's almost gone
I'd apologize, but I don't realize what I'm doing wrong
I never know

[Chorus: Neon Hitch & (Travie McCoy)]
I don't know where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door (That's love, yeah)
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know where you're going (Uh-huh, ok, what's that?)
Just get your ass back home

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
And you've been nothing but amazing and I'll never take that for granted
Half of these birds would've flew the coop but you, you truly understand it
And the fact you stood beside me every time you heard some bogusness (Tough love)
You deserve a standing O cause they'd have just been over it
Let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk
Like we don't hear what they saying
Let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk
We'll just drive by and keep waving
'Cause you and I above all that, just let 'em wallow in it
And now they all choked up, yuck - 'cause they be swallowin' it

[Chorus: Neon Hitch & (Travie McCoy)]
I don't know where you're going (Yeah)
Or when you're coming home (Alright)
I left the keys under the mat (I'm coming home, mama)
(Mama, I'm coming home)
To our front door (That's love)
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know where you're going (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Just get your ass back home

[Interlude: Travie McCoy]
No one holds me down like you do sweetheart
You keep doing that, I'll keep doing this
And we'll be alright, trust that
We put the ""us"" in ""trust"", baby
Ahh, let's go!

[Bridge: Neon Hitch]
I don't care what you're after
As long as I'm the one, no
I don't care why you're leaving
You'll miss me when you're gone

[Chorus: Neon Hitch & (Travie McCoy)]
I don't know where you're going (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Or when you're coming home (Ok)
I left the keys under the mat (I'm home now, baby, let's go)
To our front door (Uh-huh)
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know where you're going
Just get your ass back home

Do you smoke, do you drink
Do you yell out, ""Hank""
Do you fold it in your pocket
Do you lock it in the bank
Do you jack it up, or drop it down to the ground
Put the juice in the Goose
Or the Coke in the Crown

[Chorus: Kenny Chesney]
Whatever makes you feel like a rock star
Yeah, you can kick it back chilling
Or you can rock hard
You busted your ass all week
And now, it's your time to be
Whatever you wanna be
You can dress to kill, you can shoot to thrill
Try to seal the deal
Whatever makes you feel like a rock star

[Verse 2: Tim McGraw]
Do you kick the dirt, or work a Vegas stop
Do you hit the strip, or roll a country mile
Do you wear uptight, or do keep it loose
Do you leave it in the truck
Or sneak it in in your boot

[Chorus: Tim McGraw]
Whatever makes you feel like a rock star
Yeah, you can kick it back chilling
Or you can rock hard
You busted your ass all week
And now, it's your time to be
Whatever you wanna be
You can dress to kill, you can shoot to thrill
Try to seal the deal
Whatever makes you feel like a rock star

[Verse 3: Kenny Chesney & Tim McGraw]
Now, whether you're pimped up hanging in the VIP
Or way up high in the cheapest seat
Hey, pretty mama, if you roll with me
There'll be diamonds in the sky and the radio screen

[Chorus: Tim McGraw & Kenny Chesney]
Whatever makes you feel like a rock star
Yeah, you can kick it back chilling
Or you can rock hard
You busted your ass all week

You can dress to kill, you can shoot to thrill
Try to seal the deal

290,290,Dancin' Away With My Heart,"[Verse 1]
And I finally asked you to dance on the last slow song
Beneath that moon that was really a disco ball
I can still feel my head on your shoulder
And hoping that song would never be over

[Chorus]
I haven't seen you in ages
Sometimes I find myself
Wondering where you are
For me, you'll always be 18
And beautiful, and dancin' away with my heart

[Verse 2]
I brushed your curls back so I could see your eyes
And the way you moved me was like you were reading my mind
I can still feel you lean in to kiss me
I can't help but wonder if you ever miss me

[Chorus]
I haven't seen you in ages
Sometimes I find myself
Wondering where you are
For me, you'll always be 18
And beautiful, and dancin' away with my heart

[Bridge]
You headed off to college
At the end of that summer and we lost touch
I guess I didn't realize even at that moment we lost so much

Sometimes I find myself
Wondering where you are
For me, you'll always be 18
And beautiful, and dancin' away with my heart

Rolling down a country road
She's my shotgun rider
I'm the lucky dog beside her
My lips are where her kisses go
She loves when we go to the river and get in the water
And buddy she is hotter than south Georgia in July
Man when I'm with her I can't get enough of her
I got to kiss her and I got to hug her
And brother she's mine all mine

This ole boy got it going on
Got the good lord smiling on me
Her big blue eyes and the sweet red wine
Got me buzzin' like a bee
She's got her pretty little head on my shoulder
Nobody else get's to hold her
But this ole boy

We're in my old ford oh lord
Holes in my floor board
But she don't seem to mind
We park in a hay field
Fog up the windshield
My kind of killing time
She sweetens my tea and she butters my biscuit
I am who I am and buddy she gets it
I ain't got to change a thing
And I don't know if it could get any better
But man if it does then i reckon i better get to picking out a ring

This ole boy got it going on
Got the good lord smiling on me
Her big blue eyes and the sweet red wine
Got me buzzin' like a bee
She's got her pretty little head on my shoulder

To keep a roof above our heads,
You chose, a life for me, no never gave up, I admire you, For the strength you’ve instilled in me,
You were so young, You were just my age, when you had me mom, You were so brave. There was nothing gonna stop or get in our way. And I know you will always be there for me
So when you’re lost and you’re tired
When you’re broken in two
Let my love take you higher
'Cause I, I still turn to you
I still turn to you, I still turn to you
It was ’94, the year that everything started to change, from before, You had to be a woman, you were forced to change your ways, to change your ways

Then you found the Lord, You gave your life to Him, And you could not
Ignore, the love he had for you, and I wanted more of your heart

So when you’re lost and you’re tired
When you’re broken in two
Let my love take you higher
'Cause I, I still turn to you

I don’t know what I’d if you left me
So please don’t go away
Everything that you are is who I am
Who I am today
So when you’re lost and you’re tired
When you’re broken in two
Let my love take you higher
'Cause I, I still turn to you. I still turn to you, I still turn to you

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
I be tryna chill, bitches wanna fuck me
Every little city I go, ""Fuck me!""
Shawty must’ve heard, got the word, I move that D
Had it by her bladder, she like, “Oh, I gotta pee!” Hahaha
Ran into a Rothko in my restroom
Singer slash actress in my bedroom
Gotta have a ticket for a walk through
Everything I do is Big (""Who y'all talkin to?"")
I talk big money, I talk big homes
I sell out arenas, I call that getting dome
Million dollar voice, came through phone
We heading to the top, if you coming, come on
I’m flying out to Pisa, just to get some pizza
Fly down to Jamaica, just to roll some reefer
Sex on the beach, left love speechless
They say that money talk, tell these other niggas speak up
What’s up

[Chorus: Rihanna]

Come on, let me know if you want some more
You know what I like, now get it right

Say you want me to do and I got you
Tell me how to love you, tell me how to hold you

And you will never have another like me

299,299,Another Round,"[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Don't you be holding back your love
Don't you be holding back (don't you, don't you)
Don't you be holding back your love
Don't you be holding back
'Cause in the end, girl, you're gonna want another round, another round (another round, another round)
Girl, you're gonna want another round, another round (another round, another round)
I used to want you and her and her and her and you and her and her
I used to want you and her and her and her, now all I want, all I want is you

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown, Fat Joe & Both]
Shawty got a mean walk, a mean shoe game
Bitch badder than any bitch that you name
I'm talkin' Janet, yeah, maybe Kim K
I heard Rihanna, she like it kinky, baby, come on

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
Quit playin', girl, you know that you want it
I can tell just by the way you push it out and flaunt it, you bad
Somethin' like Dirty Diana, body dope as heroin
The sex is off the handle
Your ex couldn't beat it, I hit it like a free throw
And since I lost some weight you say I got a big ego (I got a big ego)
It's too strong, you said the drive stick
Well, baby, just peel off
Lovin' how it lasts long, leave the sheets gushy
Fuck you with the mask on, Halloween pussy (haha)
Your body shivers and troubles with each and every stroke
Pussy wetter than ever, enough to sink a boat

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Don't you be holding back your love
Don't you be holding back (don't you, don't you)
Don't you be holding back your love
Don't you be holding back
'Cause in the end, girl, you're gonna want another round, another round (another round, another round)
Girl, you're gonna want another round, another round (another round, another round)
I used to want you and her and her and her and you and her and her
I used to want you and her and her and her, now all I want, all I want is you

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown, Fat Joe & Both]
Shawty got a mean walk, a mean shoe game
Bitch badder than any bitch that you name
I'm talkin' Janet, yeah, maybe Kim K
I heard Rihanna, she like it kinky, baby, come on

[Verse 2: Fat Joe & Chris Brown & Both]
Never hesitate, purchasin' in every state
Transported in foreign cars to large estates
So believe me, you know you wanna come home, girl
As long as we can kick it with your home girl
A two on one fast break, that's a slam dunk
I know you want it, I can take you where ya man won't (yeah)
Champs, Alize, think Rolls Royce (yeah)
Yellow Nuvo and pink boy shorts

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Don't you be holding back your love
Don't you be holding back (don't you, don't you)
Don't you be holding back your love
Don't you be holding back
'Cause in the end, girl, you're gonna want another round, another round, yeah (another round, another round)
Girl, you're gonna want another round, another round, ooh (another round, another round)
I used to want you and her and her and her and you and her and her
I used to want you and her and her and her, now all I want, all I want is you

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Girl, you got that bomb thing, no, I can't resist
I'ma light them candles, girl, then tie up your wrists
Then I'm licking chocolate right off of your stomach
Baby, you ain't handled freaky shit like this
And I start dripping ice down ya spine, oh, oh
I'ma make you mine
And now you're telling all your girls I done tore it up
So don't be mad that they all want me, there's room for all of us

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Don't you be holding back your love (yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh)
Don't you be holding back (don't you, don't you)
Don't you be holding back your love (don't you, don't you)
Don't you be holding back
'Cause in the end, girl, you're gonna want another round, another round, oh (another round, another round)
Girl, you're gonna want another round, another round (another round, another round)
I used to want you and her and her and her and you and her and her (you and her and her, her)
I used to want you and her and her and her, now all I want, all I want is you (her)

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Shawty got a mean walk, a mean shoe game
Bitch badder than any bitch that you name
Go, girl, yeah, just shake it
I want you, baby, naked","['dont', 'you', 'be', 'hold', 'back', 'your', 'love', 'dont', 'you', 'be', 'hold', 'back', 'your', 'love', 'dont', 'you', 'be', 'hold', 'back', 'i', 'use', 'to', 'want', 'you', 'and', 'her', 'and', 'her', 'and', 'her', 'and', 'you', 'and', 'her', 'and', 'her', 'i', 'use', 'to', 'want', 'you', 'and', 'her', 'and', 'her', 'and', 'her', 'now', 'all', 'i', 'want', 'all', 'i', 'want', 'be', 'you', 'shawty', 'get', 'a', 'mean', 'walk', 'a', 'mean', 'shoe', 'game', 'bitch', 'badder', 'than', 'any', 'bitch', 'that', 'you', 'name', 'im', 'talkin', 'janet', 'yeah', 'maybe', 'kim', 'k', 'i', 'hear', 'rihanna', 'she', 'like', 'it', 'kinky', 'baby', 'come', 'on', 'quit', 'playin', 'girl', 'you', 'know', 'that', 'you', 'want', 'it', 'i', 'can', 'tell', 'just', 'by', 'the', 'way', 'you', 'push', 'it', 'out', 'and', 'flaunt', 'it', 'you', 'bad', 'somethin', 'like', 'dirty', 'diana', 'body', 'dope', 'as', 'heroin', 'the', 'sex', 'be', 'off', 'the', 'handle', 'your', 'ex', 'couldnt', 'beat', 'it', 'i', 'hit', 'it', 'like', 'a', 'free', 'throw', 'its', 'too', 'strong', 'you', 'say', 'the', 'drive', 'stick', 'well', 'baby', 'just', 'peel', 'off', 'lovin', 'how', 'it', 'last', 'long', 'leave', 'the', 'sheet', 'gushy', 'your', 'body', 'shiver', 'and', 'trouble', 'with', 'each', 'and', 'every', 'stroke', 'pussy', 'wetter', 'than', 'ever', 'enough', 'to', 'sink', 'a', 'boat', 'dont', 'you', 'be', 'hold', 'back', 'your', 'love', 'dont', 'you', 'be', 'hold', 'back', 'your', 'love', 'dont', 'you', 'be', 'hold', 'back', 'i', 'use', 'to', 'want', 'you', 'and', 'her', 'and', 'her', 'and', 'her', 'and', 'you', 'and', 'her', 'and', 'her', 'i', 'use', 'to', 'want', 'you', 'and', 'her', 'and', 'her', 'and', 'her', 'now', 'all', 'i', 'want', 'all', 'i', 'want', 'be', 'you', 'shawty', 'get', 'a', 'mean', 'walk', 'a', 'mean', 'shoe', 'game', 'bitch', 'badder', 'than', 'any', 'bitch', 'that', 'you', 'name', 'im', 'talkin', 'janet', 'yeah', 'maybe', 'kim', 'k', 'i', 'hear', 'rihanna', 'she', 'like', 'it', 'kinky', 'baby', 'come', 'on', 'never', 'hesitate', 'purchasin', 'in', 'every', 'state', 'transport', 'in', 'foreign', 'cars', 'to', 'large', 'estates', 'so', 'believe', 'me', 'you', 'know', 'you', 'wanna', 'come', 'home', 'girl', 'as', 'long', 'as', 'we', 'can', 'kick', 'it', 'with', 'your', 'home', 'girl', 'a', 'two', 'on', 'one', 'fast', 'break', 'thats', 'a', 'slam', 'dunk', 'yellow', 'nuvo', 'and', 'pink', 'boy', 'short', 'dont', 'you', 'be', 'hold', 'back', 'your', 'love', 'dont', 'you', 'be', 'hold', 'back', 'your', 'love', 'dont', 'you', 'be', 'hold', 'back', 'i', 'use', 'to', 'want', 'you', 'and', 'her', 'and', 'her', 'and', 'her', 'and', 'you', 'and', 'her', 'and', 'her', 'i', 'use', 'to', 'want', 'you', 'and', 'her', 'and', 'her', 'and', 'her', 'now', 'all', 'i', 'want', 'all', 'i', 'want', 'be', 'you', 'girl', 'you', 'get', 'that', 'bomb', 'thing', 'no', 'i', 'cant', 'resist', 'ima', 'light', 'them', 'candle', 'girl', 'then', 'tie', 'up', 'your', 'wrists', 'then', 'im', 'lick', 'chocolate', 'right', 'off', 'of', 'your', 'stomach', 'baby', 'you', 'aint', 'handle', 'freaky', 'shit', 'like', 'this', 'and', 'i', 'start', 'drip', 'ice', 'down', 'ya', 'spine', 'oh', 'oh', 'ima', 'make', 'you', 'mine', 'and', 'now', 'youre', 'tell', 'all', 'your', 'girls', 'i', 'do', 'tear', 'it', 'up', 'so', 'dont', 'be', 'mad', 'that', 'they', 'all', 'want', 'me', 'theres', 'room', 'for', 'all', 'of', 'us', 'dont', 'you', 'be', 'hold', 'back', 'shawty', 'get', 'a', 'mean', 'walk', 'a', 'mean', 'shoe', 'game', 'bitch', 'badder', 'than', 'any', 'bitch', 'that', 'you', 'name', 'go', 'girl', 'yeah', 'just', 'shake', 'it', 'i', 'want', 'you', 'baby', 'naked']",489,Fat Joe,Fat Joe Featuring Chris Brown,2012,"[100, 96, 84, 80, 82, 83]",6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0
300,300,A Woman Like You,"Last night, outta the blue
Driftin' off to the evening news
She said ""Honey, what would you do
If you'd never met me""
I just laughed, said ""I don't know
But I could take a couple guesses though""
And then tried to dig real deep
Said, ""Darling honestly...

I'd do a lot more offshore fishin'
I'd probably eat more drive-thru chicken
Take a few strokes off my golf game
If I'd have never known your name
I'd still be driving that old green 'Nova
I probably never would have heard of yoga
Be a better football fan
But if I was a single man
Alone and out there on the loose
Well I'd be looking for a woman like you.""

I could tell that got her attention
So I said, ""Oh yeah, I forgot to mention
I wouldn't trade a single day
For 100 years the other way.""
She just smiled and rolled her eyes,
Cause she's heard all of my lines
I said, ""C'mon on girl, seriously
If I hadn't been so lucky

I'd be shootin' pool in my bachelor pad
Playing bass in my cover band
Restocking up cold Bud Light
For poker every Tuesday night
Yeah I'd have a dirtbike in the shed
And not one throw pillow on the bed
I'd keep my cash in a coffee can
But if I was a single man
Alone and out there on the loose
Well I'd be looking for a woman like you.""

She knows what a mess
I'd be if I didn't have her here
But to be sure
I whispered in her ear

""You know I get sick deep-sea fishin'
And you make the best fried chicken
I got a hopeless golf game
I love the sound of your name
I might miss that old green 'Nova
But I love watchin' you do yoga
I'd take a gold band on my hand
Over being a single man
Cause honestly
I don't know what I'd do
If I'd never met a woman like you.""","['last', 'night', 'outta', 'the', 'blue', 'driftin', 'off', 'to', 'the', 'even', 'news', 'she', 'say', 'honey', 'what', 'would', 'you', 'do', 'if', 'youd', 'never', 'meet', 'me', 'i', 'just', 'laugh', 'say', 'i', 'dont', 'know', 'but', 'i', 'could', 'take', 'a', 'couple', 'guess', 'though', 'and', 'then', 'try', 'to', 'dig', 'real', 'deep', 'say', 'darling', 'honestly', 'id', 'do', 'a', 'lot', 'more', 'offshore', 'fishin', 'id', 'probably', 'eat', 'more', 'drivethru', 'chicken', 'take', 'a', 'few', 'stroke', 'off', 'my', 'golf', 'game', 'if', 'id', 'have', 'never', 'know', 'your', 'name', 'id', 'still', 'be', 'drive', 'that', 'old', 'green', 'nova', 'i', 'probably', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'hear', 'of', 'yoga', 'be', 'a', 'better', 'football', 'fan', 'but', 'if', 'i', 'be', 'a', 'single', 'man', 'alone', 'and', 'out', 'there', 'on', 'the', 'loose', 'well', 'id', 'be', 'look', 'for', 'a', 'woman', 'like', 'you', 'i', 'could', 'tell', 'that', 'get', 'her', 'attention', 'so', 'i', 'say', 'oh', 'yeah', 'i', 'forget', 'to', 'mention', 'i', 'wouldnt', 'trade', 'a', 'single', 'day', 'for', '100', 'years', 'the', 'other', 'way', 'she', 'just', 'smile', 'and', 'roll', 'her', 'eye', 'cause', 'shes', 'hear', 'all', 'of', 'my', 'line', 'i', 'say', 'cmon', 'on', 'girl', 'seriously', 'if', 'i', 'hadnt', 'be', 'so', 'lucky', 'id', 'be', 'shootin', 'pool', 'in', 'my', 'bachelor', 'pad', 'play', 'bass', 'in', 'my', 'cover', 'band', 'restock', 'up', 'cold', 'bud', 'light', 'for', 'poker', 'every', 'tuesday', 'night', 'yeah', 'id', 'have', 'a', 'dirtbike', 'in', 'the', 'shed', 'and', 'not', 'one', 'throw', 'pillow', 'on', 'the', 'bed', 'id', 'keep', 'my', 'cash', 'in', 'a', 'coffee', 'can', 'but', 'if', 'i', 'be', 'a', 'single', 'man', 'alone', 'and', 'out', 'there', 'on', 'the', 'loose', 'well', 'id', 'be', 'look', 'for', 'a', 'woman', 'like', 'you', 'she', 'know', 'what', 'a', 'mess', 'id', 'be', 'if', 'i', 'didnt', 'have', 'her', 'here', 'but', 'to', 'be', 'sure', 'i', 'whisper', 'in', 'her', 'ear', 'you', 'know', 'i', 'get', 'sick', 'deepsea', 'fishin', 'and', 'you', 'make', 'the', 'best', 'fry', 'chicken', 'i', 'get', 'a', 'hopeless', 'golf', 'game', 'i', 'love', 'the', 'sound', 'of', 'your', 'name', 'i', 'might', 'miss', 'that', 'old', 'green', 'nova', 'but', 'i', 'love', 'watchin', 'you', 'do', 'yoga', 'id', 'take', 'a', 'gold', 'band', 'on', 'my', 'hand', 'over', 'be', 'a', 'single', 'man', 'cause', 'honestly', 'i', 'dont', 'know', 'what', 'id', 'do', 'if', 'id', 'never', 'meet', 'a', 'woman', 'like', 'you']",337,Lee Brice,Lee Brice,2012,"[52, 45, 41, 36, 36, 34, 33, 38, 46, 43, 44, 52, 52, 59, 60, 66, 66, 81, 96]",19,A Woman Like You,https://open.spotify.com/track/3oyMHCAAcnWFdcGuVgwfhd,3oyMHCAAcnWFdcGuVgwfhd,spotify:track:3oyMHCAAcnWFdcGuVgwfhd,Hard 2 Love,0RnVSSUbSBEjk5MlQZhYYP,spotify:album:0RnVSSUbSBEjk5MlQZhYYP,Lee Brice,5Zq7R5qmi58ByYyBQTlNuk,spotify:artist:5Zq7R5qmi58ByYyBQTlNuk,209.78599999999997,13.0,60.0,2012-04-24,0.5920000000000001,0.584,7.0,-7.422000000000001,1.0,0.0305,0.245,0.0,0.0862,0.371,160.048,"['contemporary country', 'country', 'country road', 'modern country rock']",[],1.0

302,302,Shake It Out,"Santana: Regrets collect like old friends
Here to relive your darkest moments
I can see no way, I can see no way
And all of the ghouls come out to play

Tina: Every demon wants his pound of flesh
But I like to keep some things to myself
I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn

Mercedes: And I've been a fool and I've been blind
I can never leave the past behind
I can see no way, I can see no way

Tina & Mercedes: I'm always dragging that horse around
Our love is pastured, such a mournful sound

Mercedes: Tonight I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground
Santana: So I like to keep my issues drawn
But it's always darkest before the dawn

All: Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa

Tina & Santana: And I am done with my graceless heart
So tonight I'm gonna cut it out and then restart
All: Cause I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn

Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa

Santana: And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
Mercedes: And given half the chance, would I take any of it back?
Tina: It's a fine romance but it's left me so undone
All: It's always darkest before the dawn
Ooh hoo oooh hoo...

Santana: And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
Tina & Santana:z So here's to drinks in the dark at the end of my rope
Santana: And I'm ready to suffer and I'm ready to hope
All: It's a shot in the dark aimed right at my throat, cause
Looking for heaven, found the devil in me
Looking for heaven, found the devil in me
But what the hell?
I'm gonna let it happen to me

Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa

But for now, forget about that
Blow the whistle, baby, you're the referee, dalé

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Pitbull]
You put it down like New York City, I never sleep (Yeah)
Wild like Los Angeles, my fantasy (Chris Brown, woo!)
Hotter than Miami, I-I-I feel the heat, oh, yeah
Oh, girl, it's international love, oh, oh, oh, yeah, it's international love (woo!)

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
I don’t play football, but I've touched down everywhere
(Everywhere? Everywhere)
I don’t play baseball, but I've hit a home run everywhere (Everywhere? Everywhere) (Dale)
I've been to countries and cities I can’t pronounce and the places on the globe I didn't know existed (Yeah)
In Romania, she pulled me to the side and told me, ""Pit, you can have me and my sister""
In Lebanon, yeah, the women are bomb
And in Greece, you've guessed it the women are sweet
Been all around the world, but I ain't gon' lie
There's nothing like Miami’s heat (Dalé)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Pitbull]
You put it down like New York City, I never sleep (Yeah)
Wild like Los Angeles, my fantasy (Uh-huh, woo!)
Hotter than Miami, I-I-I feel the heat, oh, yeah (woo!)
Oh, girl, it's international love, oh, oh, oh, yeah, it's international love (We're international, let's rise)

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
Down in DR they looking for visas
I ain't talking credit cards, if you know what I mean
En Cuba, la cosa esta dura, but the women get down, if you know what I mean
In Columbia the women got everything done, but they some of the most beautiful women I've ever seen
In Brazil, they freaky with big ol' boobs and they thongs, blue yellow and green
En L.A., tengo la Mexicana
En New York, tengo la boricua
Besitos para todas las mujeres en Venezuela, muah
Y en Miami tengo a cualquiera

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Pitbull]
You put it down like New York City, hey, I never sleep
Wild like Los Angeles, oh, whoa, my fantasy (Woo!)
Hotter than Miami, I-I-I feel the heat, oh, yeah
Oh, girl, it's international love, oh, oh, oh, yeah, it's international love (All around the world, international, woo!)

[Bridge: Chris Brown & Pitbull]
There’s not a place that your love don’t affect me, baby
So don’t ever change
I crossed the globe when I'm with you, baby
Hey, oh, whoa
Chris Brown, this for the women worldwide, lets ride (woo!)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Pitbull]
You put it down like New York City, I never sleep (Woo)
Wild like Los Angeles, my fantasy (Ayy, ayy)
Hotter than Miami, I-I-I feel the heat (You're hotter than Miami) (305)
Oh, girl, it's international love, oh, oh, oh, yeah, it's international love (Woo! Let's ride)
You put it down like New York City, I never sleep (Down) (woo!)
Wild like Los Angeles, my fantasy (Los Angeles)
Hotter than Miami, I-I-I feel the heat, oh, yeah (305)
Oh, oh, it's international love, oh, oh, oh, it's international love (Woo!)

(Stay schemin', niggas tryna get at me, dawg)
I ride for my niggas

[Couplet 1 - Rick Ross]
Damn, life's so short
Fuck, I don't wanna go to court
Fuck it, got a budget for the lawyer, though
Fuck it, I’m on the run for the month
I’m in the bucket, paid 200 for it
My lil niggas thuggin’, even got me paranoid
I’m gettin money, that's in any nigga category
Double M, I got G’s out in California

[Refrain]

[Couplet 2 : Drake]
It bothers me when the gods get to acting like the broads
Guess every team doesn’t come complete with niggas like ours
That's why I see no need to compete with niggas like y’all
I just ask them when you see me you speak up, nigga, that's all
Don’t be ducking like you never wanted nothing
It's feeling like rap changed, there was a time it was rugged
Back then if a nigga reached it was for the weapon
Nowadays niggas reach just to sell they record
Spaghetti bolognese in the Polo Lounge
Me and my G from DC that's how I roll around
Might look light, but we heavy though
You think Drake will pull some shit like that? You never know
Million dollar meetings in a Polo Lounge
Me and my man Oliver North that's how I roll around
Shawty wanna tell me secrets 'bout a rap nigga
I tell that bitch it's more attractive when you hold it down
Kobe 'bout to lose a hundred fifty M’s
Kobe my nigga I hate it had to be him
Bitch you wasn't with me shooting in the gym
(Bitch you wasn't with me shooting in the gym)
Tell Lucian I said ""fuck it"", I’m tearing holes in my budget
Bag her like we in Publix and take her ass out in public
Ordered her the filet told 'em butterfly it she’ll love it
She used to soda and nuggets she really just out here thuggin'
I'm just hittin my pinnacle, you and pussy identical
You like the fucking finish line, we can’t wait to run into you
But let me get my mind off that
Young rich motherfucker getting mine off rap with my niggas

From the hoopty coupe to that Ghost, dog
Pigeons on the roof like Ghost Dog
Dwight Howard on the post, dog
My niggas got the powder through the post, dog
Watch the body tilt when you hit the head
Niggas lost mills tryna beat the Feds
10 grams off my last 250 now
Big ass crib, 250 down, damn
Gave my nigga Max 7-5
Then gave my nigga Penthouse another 30
Fuck it, got me thinking like I'm 7-5

Then they hung out
But you came home around three, yes you did
If six of y'all went out (ah)
Then four of you were really cheap
'Cause only two of you had dinner
I found your credit card receipt

Blaine with New Directions:
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags, up and leave
Don't you dare come running back to me

It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you, leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy

Blaine:
I'll pack your bags
So you can leave town for a week, yes I am
The phone rings
And then you look at me
You said it was one of your friends
Down on 54th Street, boy
So why did 2-1-3

Blaine with New Directions:
Show up on your caller ID? (Blaine: Oh)

It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags, up and leave
Don't you dare come running back to me

It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you, leave your key
I'd rather be alone, than unhappy

New Directions Girls (Blaine):
I have been through all of this before
(I've been through all this before)
So how would you think
(Don't think about, don't think about it)
That I could stand around and take some more?
(Get goin', get goin')
Things are gonna change
(Things are goin' to change baby)
'Coz I don't wanna be a fool anymore
(You don't stand no chance boy)
That's why you have to leave
(I say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahhh)
So don't turn around to see my face
(Don't turn around!)

Blaine with New Directions:
There's no more tears left here
For you to see

Blaine:
Was it really worth you going out like that, tell me
Was it really worth you going out like that
See I'm moving on
And I refuse to turn back (Blaine with New Directions Girls: Yeahh)
See all of this time
I thought I had somebody down for me
It turns out

New Directions:
You were making a fool of me, yeah!

New Directions (Blaine):
(Ah, Ah, Yeah, Ah)
It's not right, (It's not right) but it's okay (It's okay)
I'm gonna (I'm gonna, I'm gonna) make it anyway (Yeahhh)
Pack your bags, (Close the door) up and leave (And leave your keys)
Don't you dare (I'd rather be alone than unhappy) come running back to me

It's not right, (It's not right) but it's okay (It's okay, baby)
I'm gonna make it (I can pay my own rent) anyway
(I can pay my own rent)
Close the door (Pay my light bills) behind you
Leave your key (Take care my business)

Pluto, Future
(K.E. on the Track) Hey!

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Tell you off the top, I'm bossed up
You ain't talking money, don't talk to us
I'm steady stacking that guap up
Ball harder than you when I'm locked up
You the type of nigga that pop up
When niggas rolling that kush, huh?
Got mine growing like grapevines
In the backyard, come look, bruh
I pull up, hop out
Bad hoes just pop out
Hating niggas better watch out
Still riding with that Glock out
My style so mean til it's hostile
And aggressive dawg, come check your dawg
Spend a couple of mill', no stress at all
Big bankroll, no checks at all
FYI, I'm flexing y'all
Game A1 professional
You small ball like golf balls
I'm basketball, go ask your broad
Tell her legs open sesame
Abracadabra, she wet for me
Like ta-da, voila
Gucci, Louie, Stravers, Prada, ah!

[Chorus: Future]
Fishtailing out the parking lot leaving Magic
Two bad bitches and I got 'em out of Magic
The way I make the work disappear, call it magic
Sipping on the purple and the yellow, drinking magic
Voila, magic, voila, magic
Yoila, magic, voila, magic
Fishtailing out the parking lot leaving Magic
Sipping on the purple and the yellow, drinking magic

[Verse 2: Future]
On my way to Aspen, I forgot to do my taxes
Call up my accountant, he gon' make it do magic
Had to get a driver just to drop me at the airport
Way I smoked the blunts, man I burned 'em up like Newports
Fifty thousand dollars on superstar attire
K.E. and Young Future bringing them fire
All this damn cash make a bitch wanna retire
Gotta drop a half a brick, you wanna put me on a flyer
Excuse me but my lingo crazy
See these diamonds, ain't none of 'em fugazi
Two bad bitches wanna fuck me, the greatest
AMG in a brand new Mercedes
Turn out the lot, I'ma do a 180
For the haters, I'ma go ahead do a 360
Drinking on the Sprite, got lean all in it
I'ma astronaut nigga better church my pimping

[Chorus: Future]
Fishtailing out the parking lot leaving Magic
Two bad bitches and I got 'em out of Magic
The way I make the work disappear, call it magic
Sipping on the purple and the yellow, drinking magic
Voila, magic, voila, magic
Yoila, magic, voila, magic
Fishtailing out the parking lot leaving Magic
Sipping on the purple and the yellow, drinking magic

[Verse 3: Future]
Billionaire boy, that's true inspiration
I'm the astronaut kid, no such thing as limitation
Flying down 20 in the motherfucking spaceship
Just left Magic in the motherfucking basement
Two bitches trailing in a Bimmer out of Germany
Got a thing for me, don't want a thing from me
They like my energy, I'm a embassy
I know tricks like Criss Angel
I don't trick but I could make you famous
You could disappear from your past life
You'll reappear, no outta sight
I'm Pluto talking
Jimmy walking, when you walking
I used to be fly but now I'm hawking
I rose on Earth and now I'm sci-fi, voila
I stay high, my bitches on they high horse
I double back like two cups
And crawl out in that new Porsche (Skrt)

[Chorus: Future]
Fishtailing out the parking lot leaving Magic

Don’t know where you’ve been

And I know it would kill me if I fall
I can’t be alone with you

313,313,Way Too Cold,"[As I open this book and then burn up some of this reefer/
My plan is to figure out the world and escape all my demons""](http://rapgenius.com/263773)-Kendrick Lamar, “[Kush and Corinthians](http://rapgenius.com/Kendrick-lamar-kush-and-corinthians-his-pain-lyrics)”

As fans of rap, we should come to expect vulgarity, graphic imagery, and “PG-13” lyrics from our favorite artists. However, many of these artists are religious, as proclaimed by the rappers themselves in their music. Often times, the religious, church-friendly ways don’t match with anti-biblical devices used in rap. Several elements of lyricism and culture constantly repeat and can be heard across radio waves. Let’s dive in to these contradictions — staples of the game.
EXHIBIT A: AMEN
Many of us know of the hit single released by [Meek Mill](http://rapgenius.com/artists/Meek-mill) called “[Amen](http://rapgenius.com/Meek-mill-amen-lyrics)” featuring [Drake](http://rapgenius.com/artists/Drake) and [Jeremih](http://rapgenius.com/artists/Jeremih), off of Meek’s 2012 album [Dreams and Nightmares](http://rapgenius.com/albums/Meek-mill/Dreams-and-nightmares). This song is a perfect example of what I’m referring to as a “religious contradiction.” For God’s sake, the song’s hook is like a diss track to the church:
[There’s a lot of bad bitches in the building, Amen!](http://rapgenius.com/1570068)No preacher, no church approve of any rap music […] ‘cause rap music period, there’s a lot of bad stuff that’s being said. But at the end of the day, it’s real life.Is it real life, though? Many rappers [spit about lifestyles](http://rapgenius.com/Dj-khaled-bitches-and-bottles-lets-get-it-started-lyrics) that the average person cannot relate to, much less claim to be normal. These upper echelon lifestyles are the basis of much of the “bad stuff” in hip hop, and as [Biggie](http://rapgenius.com/artists/The-notorious-b-i-g) said, “[Mo' Money Mo' Problems](http://rapgenius.com/The-notorious-big-mo-money-mo-problems-lyrics).” However, that isn’t to discount the other end of the spectrum, either; many of these rappers share thoughts about things that went on in their bad neighborhoods growing up. Religious imagery can simply be a way to represent the pain and contrast, where God lived and died with bullet holes.
EXHIBIT B: JESUS WALKS
Chi-Town native [Kanye West](http://rapgenius.com/artists/Kanye-west) does a number with this smash single from [The College Dropout](http://rapgenius.com/albums/Kanye-west/The-college-dropout), “[Jesus Walks](http://rapgenius.com/Kanye-west-jesus-walks-lyrics).” This song is by far one of my favorite rap songs of all time. Filled to the brim with biblical references, prayers via rap, and general mentions of [Jesus Christ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus~E95Echrist), West’s work is a buffet of imagery.
[God show me the way/

Because the Devil’s trying to break me down](http://rapgenius.com/1184500)PAUSE. Isn’t this the same dude that did “[H.A.M.](http://rapgenius.com/Kanye-west-ham-lyrics)” with [Jay-Z](/artists/Jay-z)? And “[Birthday Song](/2-chainz-birthday-song-lyrics)” with [2 Chainz](/artists/2-chainz)? Or “[Cold](http://rapgenius.com/Kanye-west-cold-lyrics),” where he said:

“[To whoever think their words affect me is too stupid/

And if you can do it better than me, then you do it!](http://rapgenius.com/680192)”

Come on, ‘Ye! Don’t you know that pride is one of the [seven deadly sins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven~E95Edeadly~E95Esins)? At any rate, Kanye is ironically speaking in this song about the same subject. Still, West randomly turns to a preaching tone often:
[To the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers, even the scrippers/

(Jesus walks for them)](http://rapgenius.com/18072)No matter what sins you’ve committed, what your vices are, or how troubled your past may be, Jesus still walks with you. Kanye also touches on a very important part of the subject, commercial media’s fears of being labeled “religious”
[So here go my single dog radio needs this/

They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus/

That means guns, sex, lies, videotape/

But if I talk about God my record won’t get played, huh?](http://rapgenius.com/18073)Preach, Kanye! Why is it that we love religion only when it’s convenient? Ye seems to have a grip on how, even with a successful song, religion is not welcome. Let’s move on…
EXHIBIT C: JESUS PIECE
Ahh, the famous chains…
In late 2012, rapper [Game](/artists/Game) released his fifth studio album, [Jesus Piece](http://rapgenius.com/albums/Game/Jesus-piece)*.

[Jesus pieces](http://jesus-piece.urbanup.com/2839982) serve as fantastic symbolizations of the point I’m trying to get at. Their intent is to symbolize religion, but they end up being a symbol of wealth and materialism. Remember, after all, that greed is another [deadly sin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven~E95Edeadly~E95Esins). It is more than ironic that a device used to symbolize religion has become the antithesis of religion in rap. Now THAT’S a contradiction.
Back to Game’s album: Jesus pieces have been a hot topic in rap for years ([The Notorious B.I.G.](/artists/The-notorious-b-i-g), [Kanye West](/artists/Kanye-west), and [Ghostface Killah](/artists/Ghostface-killah) all rocked one). It was inevitable that somebody was going to drop an album with that name. But really?! GAME?! Of all people?! The known violent man? Isn’t this the dude we saw on World Star in a fight with [40 Glocc](http://rapgenius.com/artists/40-glocc)?

To be fair, I’m not trying to say that you shouldn’t spread your religion if you’ve been caught sinning. As the [Bible](http://rapgenius.com/artists/Holy-bible-kjv) says, there are no perfect people (this goes for the aforementioned Kanye West). But come on, Game, you got Jesus wearing a Blood Gang-colored bandana over his face on your album cover. THAT’S outrageous.
EXHIBIT D: 4Eva N A Day
Arguably one of the most descriptive cover artworks to come out in quite some time, [Big K.R.I.T.](http://rapgenius.com/artists/Big-krit) hits the nail on the head with this mixtape. [4Eva N A Day](http://rapgenius.com/albums/Big-krit/4eva-n-a-day), released in 2012, is Big K.R.I.T.’s 10th mixtape. Without referencing any music on the tape, let me just say this about the album art: it is exactly what I’m talking about. Church on the left, strip club on the right. Bible on the left, booze on the right. This artwork completely exemplifies the sinner on Saturday, saint on Sunday point-of-view that hip hop generally holds. I give mad props.
OTHER EXAMPLES:RocNation, [Jay-Z](/artists/Jay-z)’s handcrafted imprint, signee [J.Cole](http://rapgenius.com/artists/J-cole)’s next album will be titled [Born Sinner](http://rapgenius.com/albums/J-cole/Born-sinner). On his EP [Truly Yours](http://rapgenius.com/albums/J-cole/Truly-yours), Cole spits this line:
[I was sent from Heaven with a set of horns, they’d better warn y’all](http://rapgenius.com/1497865)On [Macklemore](http://rapgenius.com/artists/Macklemore) and Ryan Lewis' album [The Heist](http://rapgenius.com/albums/Macklemore-and-ryan-lewis/The-heist) (reviewed [here](http://rapgenius.com/discussions/20755-Review-of-the-heist-by-macklemore-and-ryan-lewis)), Macklemore penned [Neon Cathedral](http://rapgenius.com/Macklemore-and-ryan-lewis-neon-cathedral-lyrics), where he describes his main vice: alcohol addiction. The title of the song alludes to the same motif seen on Big K.R.I.T.’s album cover, a juxtaposition of evil and holy.

[Rick Ross](http://rapgenius.com/artists/Rick-ross)‘ fifth album is titled [God Forgives, I Don’t](http://rapgenius.com/albums/Rick-ross/God-forgives-i-don-t).

On [T.I.](http://rapgenius.com/artists/T-i)’s 8th studio album, titled [Trouble Man: Heavy is the Head](http://rapgenius.com/albums/T-i/Trouble-man-heavy-is-the-head), the song “[Hallelujah](http://rapgenius.com/Ti-hallelujah-lyrics)” describes T.I.’s faith in god. This is the same man who wrote the song “[Trap Back Jumpin'](http://rapgenius.com/Ti-trap-back-jumping-lyrics),” an undeniably unholy anthem.

Finally, as alluded to in the title, [Kendrick Lamar](http://rapgenius.com/artists/Kendrick-lamar) takes the cake with his song on [Section.80](http://rapgenius.com/albums/Kendrick-lamar/Section-80), “[Kush and Corinthians](http://rapgenius.com/Kendrick-lamar-kush-and-corinthians-his-pain-lyrics).” As the song describes, our daily temptations are what keeps us from our closeness to our god, and sometimes, the two overlap.
[So I’m smoking my kush reading Corinthians

Smoking my kush reading Corinthians](http://rapgenius.com/285192)CONCLUSION: NEW GOD FLOWWhat am I getting at with all of these examples of religious contradictions? Well, to some extent, I just found them interesting. But, I also note that such opposition is not seen to such a degree in other genres, if at all. This poses the question: is hip hop a religion in its own right? Rap, after all, coincides with a lot of things in the bible, but goes against so much of it at the same time.

Kanye West asks this very question in his song “[Gorgeous](http://rapgenius.com/Kanye-west-gorgeous-lyrics)”
[Is hip hop just a euphemism for a new religion?](http://rapgenius.com/52901)These contradictory ways of hip-hop aren’t likely to change anytime soon.

315,315,Eyes Wide Open,"[Hook]
With our eyes wide open, we...
With our eyes wide open, we...

[Verse 1]
So this is the end of the story
Everything we had, everything we did
Is buried in dust, and this dust is
All that's left of us left of us
And only a few ever worried

While the signs were clear, they had no idea
You just get use to livin' in fear
Or give up, when you can't even picture your future

We walk the plank, with our eyes wide open

[Chorus: Call and (response)]
We walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we
(Walk the plank, with our eyes wide open, we)
Yeah we walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we
(Walk the plank, with our eyes wide open, we)

[Verse 2]
And some people offered up answers
We made out we like we heard
They were only words
They didn't add up, to a change in the way we were living (it)
And the saddest thing, is all of it could've been avoided

But it was like to stop consuming's to stop being human
And why'd I make a change if you won't
We're all in the same, boat, stayin' afloat for the moment moment moment

[Chorus]
We walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we
(Walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we)
Yeah we walk the plank with our eyes wide open, we

We walk the plank with our eyes wide, we
We walk the plank with our eyes wide, we
We walk the plank with our eyes wide, we

Right in between lust and love
You go and mess things up

Wish we would never been, girl we was better friends
You didn't had to tell me, what; where, why and when
Um why I didn't need it
Cause you wasn't my girlfriend
We had a good thing
You would come by and kick it
Give me that good thing
Then after we were finished
You go your way, I go my way, it was whatever
Tell me what in the hell made us
Think this wanna gon' be better
And now I'm telling you lies
All because I hate to see the tears in your eyes
Of course I want my cake, and eat too, I'm a guy
And of course, you don't understand
But you would if you thought like a man in love

318,318,A Thousand Years,"[Verse 1]
Heart beats fast
Colors and promises
How to be brave
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?
But watching you stand alone
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow
One step closer

[Chorus]
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

[Verse 2]
Time stands still
Beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath
Every hour has come to this
One step closer

[Chorus]
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

[Bridge]
And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
One step closer
One step closer

[Chorus]
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

[Outro]
And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more","['heart', 'beat', 'fast', 'color', 'and', 'promise', 'how', 'to', 'be', 'brave', 'how', 'can', 'i', 'love', 'when', 'im', 'afraid', 'to', 'fall', 'but', 'watch', 'you', 'stand', 'alone', 'all', 'of', 'my', 'doubt', 'suddenly', 'go', 'away', 'somehow', 'one', 'step', 'closer', 'i', 'have', 'die', 'every', 'day', 'wait', 'for', 'you', 'darling', 'dont', 'be', 'afraid', 'i', 'have', 'love', 'you', 'for', 'a', 'thousand', 'years', 'ill', 'love', 'you', 'for', 'a', 'thousand', 'more', 'time', 'stand', 'still', 'beauty', 'in', 'all', 'she', 'be', 'i', 'will', 'be', 'brave', 'i', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'anything', 'take', 'away', 'whats', 'stand', 'in', 'front', 'of', 'me', 'every', 'breath', 'every', 'hour', 'have', 'come', 'to', 'this', 'one', 'step', 'closer', 'i', 'have', 'die', 'every', 'day', 'wait', 'for', 'you', 'darling', 'dont', 'be', 'afraid', 'i', 'have', 'love', 'you', 'for', 'a', 'thousand', 'years', 'ill', 'love', 'you', 'for', 'a', 'thousand', 'more', 'and', 'all', 'along', 'i', 'believe', 'i', 'would', 'find', 'you', 'time', 'have', 'bring', 'your', 'heart', 'to', 'me', 'i', 'have', 'love', 'you', 'for', 'a', 'thousand', 'years', 'ill', 'love', 'you', 'for', 'a', 'thousand', 'more', 'one', 'step', 'closer', 'one', 'step', 'closer', 'i', 'have', 'die', 'every', 'day', 'wait', 'for', 'you', 'darling', 'dont', 'be', 'afraid', 'i', 'have', 'love', 'you', 'for', 'a', 'thousand', 'years', 'ill', 'love', 'you', 'for', 'a', 'thousand', 'more', 'and', 'all', 'along', 'i', 'believe', 'i', 'would', 'find', 'you', 'time', 'have', 'bring', 'your', 'heart', 'to', 'me', 'i', 'have', 'love', 'you', 'for', 'a', 'thousand', 'years', 'ill', 'love', 'you', 'for', 'a', 'thousand', 'more']",220,Christina Perri,Christina Perri,2012,"[46, 46, 40, 36, 35, 34, 36, 34, 35, 31, 38, 51, 54, 54, 52, 50, 52]",17,A Thousand Years,https://open.spotify.com/track/6lanRgr6wXibZr8KgzXxBl,6lanRgr6wXibZr8KgzXxBl,spotify:track:6lanRgr6wXibZr8KgzXxBl,A Thousand Years,15yvc643iYfQtb6zh9NEJo,spotify:album:15yvc643iYfQtb6zh9NEJo,Christina Perri,7H55rcKCfwqkyDFH9wpKM6,spotify:artist:7H55rcKCfwqkyDFH9wpKM6,285.12,1.0,78.0,2011-10-18,0.42100000000000004,0.40700000000000003,10.0,-7.445,1.0,0.0267,0.309,0.0009609999999999999,0.11,0.161,139.028,"['neo mellow', 'pop', 'pop rock', 'post-teen pop', 'viral pop']",[],1.0
319,319,It Will Rain,"[Verse 1]
If you ever leave me, baby
Leave some morphine at my door
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
To realize what we used to have
We don't have it anymore
There's no religion that could save me
No matter how long my knees are on the floor, oh
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm making
To keep you by my side
To keep you from walking out the door

[Chorus]
'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same if you walk away
Everyday, it will rain
Rain, rain

[Verse 2]
I'll never be your mother's favorite
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye
Ooh, if I was in their shoes, I'd be doing the same thing
Saying there goes my little girl
Walking with that troublesome guy
But they're just afraid of something they can't understand
Ooh, but little darling watch me change their minds
Yeah, for you I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try
I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding
If that'll make you mine

[Chorus]
'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same if you walk away
Everyday, it will rain
Rain, rain

[Bridge]
Ooh, don't you say (Don't you say)
Goodbye (Goodbye)
Don't you say (Don't you say)
Goodbye (Goodbye)
I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding
If that'll make it right

320,320,Can't Get Enough,"[Intro: J. Cole]
Cole World, Southside
Can’t get enough, can’t get enough
Eastside, Westside, worldwide, ride out

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Now, I ain’t got no kids yet, but this right here’s for practice
I hate to get the seats in the Benz wet
But that’s how good your ass is
Make an old man get his glasses, make Wesley pay his taxes
Then follow your moves all week on Twitter
Probably make a gay nigga reconsider
You now rockin' with the best, mane
Dress game down to the sex game
Won’t brag, but the boy been blessed, mane
Let you play with the stick; Ovechkin
She callin', she textin', she’s fallin', but let me explain
Gotta tell your old boyfriend skate, girl
‘Cause a nigga don’t play them ex games
Nope! Straight sexing, no handcuff or arresting
And I ain’t coming off of my last name
‘Cause I really can’t take no stressing
'Bout where I done been, who I done hit
Your homegirl saying, “He a bad boy.”
But I’m signed to the Roc
No time for the gossip, bitch, put down them tabloids!

[Hook: Trey Songz]
She said, “I heard you got a main chick
A mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good, and everybody knows
My homegirls tried to warn me, they tried to let me know
But what you got, I need a lot, so I can’t let you go.”

[Hook: J. Cole]
She said, “I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough of what you got
Good God, you hit the spot
Tried to let go, but I just could not
So don’t you stop, I need that.”

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Hey, Globetrotter, Cole hotter
Even way out in London town
Hoes holla, ’cause they love my sound
And I got love for the underground
Kweli, Pimp C, H-Town where Bun get down
Met a bad bitch that’ll cut all night
That’ll suck all night, you just cut off lights
Almost missed my flight
Tryna get my last little nut, all right?
She be down for whatever
Whenever I wanna get up in the guts, all right?
Never fuss or fight
On the grind, tryna find this lettuce
I love it when you give me head
I hate it when you give me headaches

[Hook: Trey Songz]
She said, “I heard you got a main chick
A mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good, and everybody knows
My homegirls tried to warn me, they tried to let me know
But what you got, I need a lot, so I can’t let you go.”

[Hook: J. Cole]
She said, “I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough of what you got
Good God, you hit the spot
Tried to let go, but I just could not
So don’t you stop, I need that.”

[Verse 3:  J. Cole]
Hey, Cole World, baby, ain’t nothin' sunny
I see ‘em hating, but it ain’t nothin' to me
I’m from the Ville, where they bang for the money
And carry fo’-fives, like change for a twenty
So what I look like, scurred?
Them niggas over there look like nerds
Never mind that, girl, let’s make a track
I’ll beat the pussy up, that’s the hook right thurr
That’s the hook right thurr! That's the hook right thurr!
Never mind that, girl, let’s make a track
I’ll beat the pussy up, that’s the hook right thurr

322,322,Sex Ain't Better Than Love,"[Intro]
Sex ain't better than love
Sex ain't, sex ain't better than love

[Verse 1]
I been outchea in these streets and I done learned
Every girl I gave my loving to was only a substitute
I been outchea in these streets and I done learned
Even though she's in my arms, this ain't where my heart belongs
Sex in the air, no loving here
Soon as I get through, I'm outta there
And it feels so bad, but it felt so good
Wishing I could care, girl, I never could
But then I fell into good love
Didn't let me touch the ground
Now I see it clear that your heart is there
And all these other women, they just can't compare, girl, I know

[Chorus]
Sex ain't better than love
I been outchea in these streets and I done learned that
Sex ain't better than love
I done seen it all, done done it all, so much better when you fall
Sex ain't better than love
Girl you've been my teacher and I've learned that
Sex ain't better than love
Sex ain't, sex ain't better than love

[Verse 2]
Feelings I thought that I would never have
Ooh, I'm so open and I got it bad
I got you now and I'ma make it last
She says my baby, she can't wait to have
Love in the air, never been so clear
So beautiful, bring your body here
Let me fall into good love
I wanna hear the lovely sound
Let me take my time while we in this bed
You were made for me and I don't wanna share, girl, I know

[Chorus]
Sex ain't better than love
I been outchea in these streets and I done learned that
Sex ain't better than love
I done seen it all, done done it all, so much better when you fall
Sex ain't better than love
Girl you've been my teacher and I've learned that
Sex ain't better than love
Sex ain't, sex ain't better than love

[Bridge]
Don't you ever leave
Baby girl, I need, need you love to breathe
Never been so clear to me
I was blinded but now I see because

[Chorus]
Sex ain't better than love
I been outchea in these streets and I done learned that

323,323,Is Anybody Out There?,"[Intro: Nelly Furtado]
I don't wanna be left
In this war tonight
Am I alone in this fight?
Is anybody out there, yeah
Don't wanna be left, left in this world behind
Say you'll run to my side

[Verse 1: K'naan]
Something 'bout Mary
Never won a pageant
Never felt pretty
Never looked like Cameron
Diaz was her last name
Always been abandoned
Keep your head up
Baby girl this is your anthem
There goes Hannah
Showin' off her banner
Rocking that crown
Make them boys go bananas
When you're insecure about yourself
It's a fact
You can point a finger
But there's three pointing back

[Pre-Hook: K'naan]
I can see her crying out, yeah
Is there anybody out there?
She's really counting on your love
Still struggling uphill
But you act like you don't care
Right now she could really use a shoulder
Hanging onto the edge til it's over
She's crying for your love tonight
Loneliest is hard to survive, she said

[Hook]

[Verse 2: K'naan]
His name was Adam
When his mom had him
Dad was a phantom
Never took a look at him
Grew up mad and
Antisocial
Hated outdoors
Always in playing madden
Adam was lonely
Drugs were the only
Way out of his own life
Now he's slowly
Losing his fire
Close to retire
With one last hope
He puts his arms up higher

[Pre-Hook: K'naan]
I can see him crying out, yeah
Is there anybody out there?
He's really counting on your love
Still struggling uphill
But you act like you don't care
Right now he could really use a shoulder
Hanging onto the edge til it's over
He's crying for your love tonight
Loneliest heart to survive, he said

[Hook:]

[Bridge: Nelly Furtado]
If you feel the way I feel
Like you've been talking to yourself
Well this one's for everyone who's felt invisible
Lonely in a crowded room
Searching for someone like you
Can't do it all alone (no one can baby)
Can't do it all alone (no one should baby)
Is anybody out there?
(somebody, anybody)
Is anybody out there?
I'm right here for your
Is anybody out there?

Don't you dare go runnin' down my little town where I grew up
And I won't cuss your city lights
If you ain't ever took a ride around and cruised right through the heart of my town
Anything you say would be a lie

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We may live our lives a little slower
But that don't mean I wouldn't be proud to show ya

Where I come from
There's a preacher man in a cowboy shirt
Where I come from
Where a couple of boys fight in the parkin' lot
No, nobody's gonna call the cops
Where I come from

[Verse 2]
See that door right there, man, I swear that it ain't never been locked
And I guarantee that it never will
That old man right there in the rockin' chair at the courthouse square, I'll tell you now
He could buy your fancy car with hundred dollar bills

Don't let those faded overalls fool ya
He made his millions without one day of schoolin'

There's a pickup truck with the tailgate down

You don't know whether you're coming or going

You looking at me but I'm looking through you

I see the pain hidden in your pride

I see the truth in your lies
I see nobody by your side
But I'm with you when you're all alone
And you correct me when I'm looking wrong
I see that guilt beneath the shame
I see your soul through your window pane
I see the scars that remain
I see you Wayne, I'm lookin at the ..

Light it up, that's smoke at mirrors

I see the change, I see the message
And no message couldn't been any clearer
So I'm starting with the man in the ..

Hop in this truck and run through the red lights
Yeah where you want to go baby name the town
We can go up north, we could head down south
Roll down the windows with the radio loud
Come on turn it up, yeah
Start living your life
On the double leave your troubles behind
You and me, we're going to be alright

You could be a blackbird
On the country street

Well, here we are baby in the back of my bed
Suns going down skies turning red
Stars coming out

Felt that kiss and I can get used to this
Baby I could get used to this

Dreams: that's where I have to go
To see your beautiful face anymore
I stare at a picture of you and listen to the radio
Hope, hope there's a conversation
We both admit we had it good
But until then it's alienation, I know
That much is understood
And I realize

[Chorus]
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say I'm  not over you
(not over you)

[Verse 2]
Damn, damn girl you do it well
And I thought you were innocent
Took this heart and put it through hell
But still you're magnificent
I I'm a boomerang, doesn't matter how you throw me
I turn around and I'm back in the game
Even better than the old me
But I'm not even close without you

[Chorus]
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say I'm not over you

[Bridge]
And if I had the chance to renew
You know there isn't a thing I wouldn't do
I could get back on the right track
But only if you'd be convinced
So until then...

329,329,Tonight Is The Night,"What Befell Mr. Pickwick When He Got Into The Fleet; What

Prisoners He Saw There, And How He Passed The Night
Mr. Tom Roker, the gentleman who had accompanied Mr. Pickwick into the prison, turned sharp round to the right when he got to the bottom of the little flight of steps, and led the way, through an iron gate which stood open, and up another short flight of steps, into a long narrow gallery, dirty and low, paved with stone, and very dimly lighted by a window at each remote end.

'This,' said the gentleman, thrusting his hands into his pockets, and looking carelessly over his shoulder to Mr. Pickwick—'this here is the hall flight.'
'Oh,' replied Mr. Pickwick, looking down a dark and filthy staircase, which appeared to lead to a range of damp and gloomy stone vaults, beneath the ground, 'and those, I suppose, are the little cellars where the prisoners keep their small quantities of coals. Unpleasant places to have to go down to; but very convenient, I dare say.'

'Yes, I shouldn't wonder if they was convenient,' replied the gentleman, 'seeing that a few people live there, pretty snug. That's the Fair, that is.'

'My friend,' said Mr. Pickwick, 'you don't really mean to say that human beings live down in those wretched dungeons?'

'Don't I?' replied Mr. Roker, with indignant astonishment; 'why shouldn't I?'
'Live!—live down there!' exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.

'Live down there! Yes, and die down there, too, very often!' replied Mr. Roker; 'and what of that? Who's got to say anything agin it? Live down there! Yes, and a wery good place it is to live in, ain't it?'

As Roker turned somewhat fiercely upon Mr. Pickwick in saying this, and moreover muttered in an excited fashion certain unpleasant invocations concerning his own eyes, limbs, and circulating fluids, the latter gentleman deemed it advisable to pursue the discourse no further. Mr. Roker then proceeded to mount another staircase, as dirty as that which led to the place which has just been the subject of discussion, in which ascent he was closely followed by Mr. Pickwick and Sam.

'There,' said Mr. Roker, pausing for breath when they reached another gallery of the same dimensions as the one below, 'this is the coffee-room flight; the one above's the third, and the one above that's the top; and the room where you're a-going to sleep to-night is the warden's room, and it's this way—come on.' Having said all this in a breath, Mr. Roker mounted another flight of stairs with Mr. Pickwick and Sam Weller following at his heels.

These staircases received light from sundry windows placed at some little distance above the floor, and looking into a gravelled area bounded by a high brick wall, with iron CHEVAUX-DE-FRISE at the top. This area, it appeared from Mr. Roker's statement, was the racket-ground; and it further appeared, on the testimony of the same gentleman, that there was a smaller area in that portion of the prison which was nearest Farringdon Street, denominated and called 'the Painted Ground,' from the fact of its walls having once displayed the semblance of various men-of-war in full sail, and other artistical effects achieved in bygone times by some imprisoned draughtsman in his leisure hours.

Having communicated this piece of information, apparently more for the purpose of discharging his bosom of an important fact, than with any specific view of enlightening Mr. Pickwick, the guide, having at length reached another gallery, led the way into a small passage at the extreme end, opened a door, and disclosed an apartment of an appearance by no means inviting, containing eight or nine iron bedsteads.
'There,' said Mr. Roker, holding the door open, and looking triumphantly round at Mr. Pickwick, 'there's a room!'

Mr. Pickwick's face, however, betokened such a very trifling portion of satisfaction at the appearance of his lodging, that Mr. Roker looked, for a reciprocity of feeling, into the countenance of Samuel Weller, who, until now, had observed a dignified silence. 'There's a room, young man,' observed Mr. Roker.

'I see it,' replied Sam, with a placid nod of the head.
'You wouldn't think to find such a room as this in the Farringdon Hotel, would you?' said Mr. Roker, with a complacent smile.

To this Mr. Weller replied with an easy and unstudied closing of one eye; which might be considered to mean, either that he would have thought it, or that he would not have thought it, or that he had never thought anything at all about it, as the observer's imagination suggested. Having executed this feat, and reopened his eye, Mr. Weller proceeded to inquire which was the individual bedstead that Mr. Roker had so flatteringly described as an out-and-outer to sleep in.

'That's it,' replied Mr. Roker, pointing to a very rusty one in a corner. 'It would make any one go to sleep, that bedstead would, whether they wanted to or not.'
'I should think,' said Sam, eyeing the piece of furniture in question with a look of excessive disgust—'I should think poppies was nothing to it.'
'Nothing at all,' said Mr. Roker.

'And I s'pose,' said Sam, with a sidelong glance at his master, as if to see whether there were any symptoms of his determination being shaken by what passed, 'I s'pose the other gen'l'men as sleeps here ARE gen'l'men.'
'Nothing but it,' said Mr. Roker. 'One of 'em takes his twelve pints of ale a day, and never leaves off smoking even at his meals.'
'He must be a first-rater,' said Sam.
'A1,' replied Mr. Roker.

Nothing daunted, even by this intelligence, Mr. Pickwick smilingly announced his determination to test the powers of the narcotic bedstead for that night; and Mr. Roker, after informing him that he could retire to rest at whatever hour he thought proper, without any further notice or formality, walked off, leaving him standing with Sam in the gallery.

It was getting dark; that is to say, a few gas jets were kindled in this place which was never light, by way of compliment to the evening, which had set in outside. As it was rather warm, some of the tenants of the numerous little rooms which opened into the gallery on either hand, had set their doors ajar. Mr. Pickwick peeped into them as he passed along, with great curiosity and interest. Here, four or five great hulking fellows, just visible through a cloud of tobacco smoke, were engaged in noisy and riotous conversation over half-emptied pots of beer, or playing at all-fours with a very greasy pack of cards. In the adjoining room, some solitary tenant might be seen poring, by the light of a feeble tallow candle, over a bundle of soiled and tattered papers, yellow with dust and dropping to pieces from age, writing, for the hundredth time, some lengthened statement of his grievances, for the perusal of some great man whose eyes it would never reach, or whose heart it would never touch. In a third, a man, with his wife and a whole crowd of children, might be seen making up a scanty bed on the ground, or upon a few chairs, for the younger ones to pass the night in. And in a fourth, and a fifth, and a sixth, and a seventh, the noise, and the beer, and the tobacco smoke, and the cards, all came over again in greater force than before.

In the galleries themselves, and more especially on the stair-cases, there lingered a great number of people, who came there, some because their rooms were empty and lonesome, others because their rooms were full and hot; the greater part because they were restless and uncomfortable, and not possessed of the secret of exactly knowing what to do with themselves. There were many classes of people here, from the labouring man in his fustian jacket, to the broken-down spendthrift in his shawl dressing-gown, most appropriately out at elbows; but there was the same air about them all—a kind of listless, jail-bird, careless swagger, a vagabondish who's-afraid sort of bearing, which is wholly indescribable in words, but which any man can understand in one moment if he wish, by setting foot in the nearest debtors' prison, and looking at the very first group of people he sees there, with the same interest as Mr. Pickwick did.

'It strikes me, Sam,' said Mr. Pickwick, leaning over the iron rail at the stair-head-'it strikes me, Sam, that imprisonment for debt is scarcely any punishment at all.'
'Think not, sir?' inquired Mr. Weller.

'You see how these fellows drink, and smoke, and roar,' replied Mr. Pickwick. 'It's quite impossible that they can mind it much.'

'Ah, that's just the wery thing, Sir,' rejoined Sam, 'they don't mind it; it's a reg'lar holiday to them—all porter and skittles. It's the t'other vuns as gets done over vith this sort o' thing; them down-hearted fellers as can't svig avay at the beer, nor play at skittles neither; them as vould pay if they could, and gets low by being boxed up. I'll tell you wot it is, sir; them as is always a-idlin' in public-houses it don't damage at all, and them as is alvays a-workin' wen they can, it damages too much. ""It's unekal,"" as my father used to say wen his grog worn't made half-and-half: ""it's unekal, and that's the fault on it.""'

'I think you're right, Sam,' said Mr. Pickwick, after a few moments' reflection, 'quite right.'

'P'raps, now and then, there's some honest people as likes it,' observed Mr. Weller, in a ruminative tone, 'but I never heerd o' one as I can call to mind, 'cept the little dirty-faced man in the brown coat; and that was force of habit.'
'And who was he?' inquired Mr. Pickwick.

'Wy, that's just the wery point as nobody never know'd,' replied Sam.
'But what did he do?'

'Wy, he did wot many men as has been much better know'd has done in their time, Sir,' replied Sam, 'he run a match agin the constable, and vun it.'
'In other words, I suppose,' said Mr. Pickwick, 'he got into debt.'

'Just that, Sir,' replied Sam, 'and in course o' time he come here in consekens. It warn't much—execution for nine pound nothin', multiplied by five for costs; but hows'ever here he stopped for seventeen year. If he got any wrinkles in his face, they were stopped up vith the dirt, for both the dirty face and the brown coat wos just the same at the end o' that time as they wos at the beginnin'. He wos a wery peaceful, inoffendin' little creetur, and wos alvays a-bustlin' about for somebody, or playin' rackets and never vinnin'; till at last the turnkeys they got quite fond on him, and he wos in the lodge ev'ry night, a-chattering vith 'em, and tellin' stories, and all that 'ere. Vun night he wos in there as usual, along vith a wery old friend of his, as wos on the lock, ven he says all of a sudden, ""I ain't seen the market outside, Bill,"" he says (Fleet Market wos there at that time)—""I ain't seen the market outside, Bill,"" he says, ""for seventeen year."" ""I know you ain't,"" says the turnkey, smoking his pipe. ""I should like to see it for a minit, Bill,"" he says. ""Wery probable,"" says the turnkey, smoking his pipe wery fierce, and making believe he warn't up to wot the little man wanted. ""Bill,"" says the little man, more abrupt than afore, ""I've got the fancy in my head. Let me see the public streets once more afore I die; and if I ain't struck with apoplexy, I'll be back in five minits by the clock."" ""And wot 'ud become o' me if you WOS struck with apoplexy?"" said the turnkey. ""Wy,"" says the little creetur, ""whoever found me, 'ud bring me home, for I've got my card in my pocket, Bill,"" he says, ""No. 20, Coffee-room Flight"": and that wos true, sure enough, for wen he wanted to make the acquaintance of any new-comer, he used to pull out a little limp card vith them words on it and nothin' else; in consideration of vich, he vos alvays called Number Tventy. The turnkey takes a fixed look at him, and at last he says in a solemn manner, ""Tventy,"" he says, ""I'll trust you; you Won't get your old friend into trouble."" ""No, my boy; I hope I've somethin' better behind here,"" says the little man; and as he said it he hit his little vesket wery hard, and then a tear started out o' each eye, which wos wery extraordinary, for it wos supposed as water never touched his face. He shook the turnkey by the hand; out he vent—'

'And never came back again,' said Mr. Pickwick.
'Wrong for vunce, sir,' replied Mr. Weller, 'for back he come, two minits afore the time, a-bilin' with rage, sayin' how he'd been nearly run over by a hackney-coach that he warn't used to it; and he was blowed if he wouldn't write to the lord mayor. They got him pacified at last; and for five years arter that, he never even so much as peeped out o' the lodge gate.'

'At the expiration of that time he died, I suppose,' said Mr. Pickwick.
'No, he didn't, Sir,' replied Sam. 'He got a curiosity to go and taste the beer at a new public-house over the way, and it wos such a wery nice parlour, that he took it into his head to go there every night, which he did for a long time, always comin' back reg'lar about a quarter of an hour afore the gate shut, which was all wery snug and comfortable. At last he began to get so precious jolly, that he used to forget how the time vent, or care nothin' at all about it, and he went on gettin' later and later, till vun night his old friend wos just a-shuttin' the gate—had turned the key in fact—wen he come up. ""Hold hard, Bill,"" he says. ""Wot, ain't you come home yet, Tventy?"" says the turnkey, ""I thought you wos in, long ago."" ""No, I wasn't,"" says the little man, with a smile. ""Well, then, I'll tell you wot it is, my friend,"" says the turnkey, openin' the gate wery slow and sulky, ""it's my 'pinion as you've got into bad company o' late, which I'm wery sorry to see. Now, I don't wish to do nothing harsh,"" he says, ""but if you can't confine yourself to steady circles, and find your vay back at reg'lar hours, as sure as you're a-standin' there, I'll shut you out altogether!"" The little man was seized vith a wiolent fit o' tremblin', and never vent outside the prison walls artervards!'

As Sam concluded, Mr. Pickwick slowly retraced his steps downstairs. After a few thoughtful turns in the Painted Ground, which, as it was now dark, was nearly deserted, he intimated to Mr. Weller that he thought it high time for him to withdraw for the night; requesting him to seek a bed in some adjacent public-house, and return early in the morning, to make arrangements for the removal of his master's wardrobe from the George and Vulture. This request Mr. Samuel Weller prepared to obey, with as good a grace as he could assume, but with a very considerable show of reluctance nevertheless. He even went so far as to essay sundry ineffectual hints regarding the expediency of stretching himself on the gravel for that night; but finding Mr. Pickwick obstinately deaf to any such suggestions, finally withdrew.

There is no disguising the fact that Mr. Pickwick felt very low-spirited and uncomfortable—not for lack of society, for the prison was very full, and a bottle of wine would at once have purchased the utmost good-fellowship of a few choice spirits, without any more formal ceremony of introduction; but he was alone in the coarse, vulgar crowd, and felt the depression of spirits and sinking of heart, naturally consequent on the reflection that he was cooped and caged up, without a prospect of liberation. As to the idea of releasing himself by ministering to the sharpness of Dodson & Fogg, it never for an instant entered his thoughts.

In this frame of mind he turned again into the coffee-room gallery, and walked slowly to and fro. The place was intolerably dirty, and the smell of tobacco smoke perfectly suffocating. There was a perpetual slamming and banging of doors as the people went in and out; and the noise of their voices and footsteps echoed and re-echoed through the passages constantly. A young woman, with a child in her arms, who seemed scarcely able to crawl, from emaciation and misery, was walking up and down the passage in conversation with her husband, who had no other place to see her in. As they passed Mr. Pickwick, he could hear the female sob bitterly; and once she burst into such a passion of grief, that she was compelled to lean against the wall for support, while the man took the child in his arms, and tried to soothe her.

Mr. Pickwick's heart was really too full to bear it, and he went upstairs to bed.
Now, although the warder's room was a very uncomfortable one (being, in every point of decoration and convenience, several hundred degrees inferior to the common infirmary of a county jail), it had at present the merit of being wholly deserted save by Mr. Pickwick himself. So, he sat down at the foot of his little iron bedstead, and began to wonder how much a year the warder made out of the dirty room. Having satisfied himself, by mathematical calculation, that the apartment was about equal in annual value to the freehold of a small street in the suburbs of London, he took to wondering what possible temptation could have induced a dingy-looking fly that was crawling over his pantaloons, to come into a close prison, when he had the choice of so many airy situations—a course of meditation which led him to the irresistible conclusion that the insect was insane. After settling this point, he began to be conscious that he was getting sleepy; whereupon he took his nightcap out of the pocket in which he had had the precaution to stow it in the morning, and, leisurely undressing himself, got into bed and fell asleep.

'Bravo! Heel over toe—cut and shuffle—pay away at it, Zephyr! I'm smothered if the opera house isn't your proper hemisphere. Keep it up! Hooray!' These expressions, delivered in a most boisterous tone, and accompanied with loud peals of laughter, roused Mr. Pickwick from one of those sound slumbers which, lasting in reality some half-hour, seem to the sleeper to have been protracted for three weeks or a month.
The voice had no sooner ceased than the room was shaken with such violence that the windows rattled in their frames, and the bedsteads trembled again. Mr. Pickwick started up, and remained for some minutes fixed in mute astonishment at the scene before him.

On the floor of the room, a man in a broad-skirted green coat, with corduroy knee-smalls and gray cotton stockings, was performing the most popular steps of a hornpipe, with a slang and burlesque caricature of grace and lightness, which, combined with the very appropriate character of his costume, was inexpressibly absurd. Another man, evidently very drunk, who had probably been tumbled into bed by his companions, was sitting up between the sheets, warbling as much as he could recollect of a comic song, with the most intensely sentimental feeling and expression; while a third, seated on one of the bedsteads, was applauding both performers with the air of a profound connoisseur, and encouraging them by such ebullitions of feeling as had already roused Mr. Pickwick from his sleep.

This last man was an admirable specimen of a class of gentry which never can be seen in full perfection but in such places—they may be met with, in an imperfect state, occasionally about stable-yards and Public-houses; but they never attain their full bloom except in these hot-beds, which would almost seem to be considerately provided by the legislature for the sole purpose of rearing them.

He was a tall fellow, with an olive complexion, long dark hair, and very thick bushy whiskers meeting under his chin. He wore no neckerchief, as he had been playing rackets all day, and his Open shirt collar displayed their full luxuriance. On his head he wore one of the common eighteenpenny French skull-caps, with a gaudy tassel dangling therefrom, very happily in keeping with a common fustian coat. His legs, which, being long, were afflicted with weakness, graced a pair of Oxford-mixture trousers, made to show the full symmetry of those limbs. Being somewhat negligently braced, however, and, moreover, but imperfectly buttoned, they fell in a series of not the most graceful folds over a pair of shoes sufficiently down at heel to display a pair of very soiled white stockings. There was a rakish, vagabond smartness, and a kind of boastful rascality, about the whole man, that was worth a mine of gold.

This figure was the first to perceive that Mr. Pickwick was looking on; upon which he winked to the Zephyr, and entreated him, with mock gravity, not to wake the gentleman. 'Why, bless the gentleman's honest heart and soul!' said the Zephyr, turning round and affecting the extremity of surprise; 'the gentleman is awake. Hem, Shakespeare! How do you do, Sir? How is Mary and Sarah, sir? and the dear old lady at home, Sir? Will you have the kindness to put my compliments into the first little parcel you're sending that way, sir, and say that I would have sent 'em before, only I was afraid they might be broken in the wagon, sir?'

'Don't overwhelm the gentlemen with ordinary civilities when you see he's anxious to have something to drink,' said the gentleman with the whiskers, with a jocose air. 'Why don't you ask the gentleman what he'll take?'

'Dear me, I quite forgot,' replied the other. 'What will you take, sir? Will you take port wine, sir, or sherry wine, sir? I can recommend the ale, sir; or perhaps you'd like to taste the porter, sir? Allow me to have the felicity of hanging up your nightcap, Sir.'
With this, the speaker snatched that article of dress from Mr. Pickwick's head, and fixed it in a twinkling on that of the drunken man, who, firmly impressed with the belief that he was delighting a numerous assembly, continued to hammer away at the comic song in the most melancholy strains imaginable.

Taking a man's nightcap from his brow by violent means, and adjusting it on the head of an unknown gentleman, of dirty exterior, however ingenious a witticism in itself, is unquestionably one of those which come under the denomination of practical jokes. Viewing the matter precisely in this light, Mr. Pickwick, without the slightest intimation of his purpose, sprang vigorously out of bed, struck the Zephyr so smart a blow in the chest as to deprive him of a considerable portion of the commodity which sometimes bears his name, and then, recapturing his nightcap, boldly placed himself in an attitude of defence.

'Now,' said Mr. Pickwick, gasping no less from excitement than from the expenditure of so much energy, 'come on—both of you—both of you!' With this liberal invitation the worthy gentleman communicated a revolving motion to his clenched fists, by way of appalling his antagonists with a display of science.

It might have been Mr. Pickwick's very unexpected gallantry, or it might have been the complicated manner in which he had got himself out of bed, and fallen all in a mass upon the hornpipe man, that touched his adversaries. Touched they were; for, instead of then and there making an attempt to commit man-slaughter, as Mr. Pickwick implicitly believed they would have done, they paused, stared at each other a short time, and finally laughed outright.

'Well, you're a trump, and I like you all the better for it,' said the Zephyr. 'Now jump into bed again, or you'll catch the rheumatics. No malice, I hope?' said the man, extending a hand the size of the yellow clump of fingers which sometimes swings over a glover's door.

'Certainly not,' said Mr. Pickwick, with great alacrity; for, now that the excitement was over, he began to feel rather cool about the legs.

'Allow me the H-onour,' said the gentleman with the whiskers, presenting his dexter hand, and aspirating the h.

'With much pleasure, sir,' said Mr. Pickwick; and having executed a very long and solemn shake, he got into bed again.

'My name is Smangle, sir,' said the man with the whiskers.
'Oh,' said Mr. Pickwick.

'Mine is Mivins,' said the man in the stockings.
'I am delighted to hear it, sir,' said Mr. Pickwick.
'Hem,' coughed Mr. Smangle.
'Did you speak, sir?' said Mr. Pickwick.
'No, I did not, sir,' said Mr. Smangle.
All this was very genteel and pleasant; and, to make matters still more comfortable, Mr. Smangle assured Mr. Pickwick a great many more times that he entertained a very high respect for the feelings of a gentleman; which sentiment, indeed, did him infinite credit, as he could be in no wise supposed to understand them.

'Are you going through the court, sir?' inquired Mr. Smangle. 'Through the what?' said Mr. Pickwick.

'Through the court—Portugal Street—the Court for Relief of—You know.'
'Oh, no,' replied Mr. Pickwick. 'No, I am not.'
'Going out, perhaps?' suggested Mr. Mivins.
'I fear not,' replied Mr. Pickwick. 'I refuse to pay some damages, and am here in consequence.'

'Ah,' said Mr. Smangle, 'paper has been my ruin.'
'A stationer, I presume, Sir?' said Mr. Pickwick innocently.
'Stationer! No, no; confound and curse me! Not so low as that. No trade. When I say paper, I mean bills.'

'Oh, you use the word in that sense. I see,' said Mr. Pickwick. 'Damme! A gentleman must expect reverses,' said Smangle. 'What of that? Here am I in the Fleet Prison. Well; good. What then? I'm none the worse for that, am I?'

'Not a bit,' replied Mr. Mivins. And he was quite right; for, so far from Mr. Smangle being any the worse for it, he was something the better, inasmuch as to qualify himself for the place, he had attained gratuitous possession of certain articles of jewellery, which, long before that, had found their way to the pawnbroker's.

'Well; but come,' said Mr. Smangle; 'this is dry work. Let's rinse our mouths with a drop of burnt sherry; the last-comer shall stand it, Mivins shall fetch it, and I'll help to drink it. That's a fair and gentlemanlike division of labour, anyhow. Curse me!'
Unwilling to hazard another quarrel, Mr. Pickwick gladly assented to the proposition, and consigned the money to Mr. Mivins, who, as it was nearly eleven o'clock, lost no time in repairing to the coffee-room on his errand.

'I say,' whispered Smangle, the moment his friend had left the room; 'what did you give him?'
'Half a sovereign,' said Mr. Pickwick.
'He's a devilish pleasant gentlemanly dog,' said Mr. Smangle;—'infernal pleasant. I don't know anybody more so; but—' Here Mr. Smangle stopped short, and shook his head dubiously.

'You don't think there is any probability of his appropriating the money to his own use?' said Mr. Pickwick.

'Oh, no! Mind, I don't say that; I expressly say that he's a devilish gentlemanly fellow,' said Mr. Smangle. 'But I think, perhaps, if somebody went down, just to see that he didn't dip his beak into the jug by accident, or make some confounded mistake in losing the money as he came upstairs, it would be as well. Here, you sir, just run downstairs, and look after that gentleman, will you?'

This request was addressed to a little timid-looking, nervous man, whose appearance bespoke great poverty, and who had been crouching on his bedstead all this while, apparently stupefied by the novelty of his situation.

'You know where the coffee-room is,' said Smangle; 'just run down, and tell that gentleman you've come to help him up with the jug. Or—stop—I'll tell you what—I'll tell you how we'll do him,' said Smangle, with a cunning look.
'How?' said Mr. Pickwick.

'Send down word that he's to spend the change in cigars. Capital thought. Run and tell him that; d'ye hear? They shan't be wasted,' continued Smangle, turning to Mr. Pickwick. 'I'LL smoke 'em.'

This manoeuvring was so exceedingly ingenious and, withal, performed with such immovable composure and coolness, that Mr. Pickwick would have had no wish to disturb it, even if he had had the power. In a short time Mr. Mivins returned, bearing the sherry, which Mr. Smangle dispensed in two little cracked mugs; considerately remarking, with reference to himself, that a gentleman must not be particular under such circumstances, and that, for his part, he was not too proud to drink out of the jug. In which, to show his sincerity, he forthwith pledged the company in a draught which half emptied it.

An excellent understanding having been by these means promoted, Mr. Smangle proceeded to entertain his hearers with a relation of divers romantic adventures in which he had been from time to time engaged, involving various interesting anecdotes of a thoroughbred horse, and a magnificent Jewess, both of surpassing beauty, and much coveted by the nobility and gentry of these kingdoms.

Long before these elegant extracts from the biography of a gentleman were concluded, Mr. Mivins had betaken himself to bed, and had set in snoring for the night, leaving the timid stranger and Mr. Pickwick to the full benefit of Mr. Smangle's experiences.

Nor were the two last-named gentlemen as much edified as they might have been by the moving passages narrated. Mr. Pickwick had been in a state of slumber for some time, when he had a faint perception of the drunken man bursting out afresh with the comic song, and receiving from Mr. Smangle a gentle intimation, through the medium of the water-jug, that his audience was not musically disposed. Mr. Pickwick then once again dropped off to sleep, with a confused consciousness that Mr. Smangle was still engaged in relating a long story, the chief point of which appeared to be that, on some occasion particularly stated and set forth, he had 'done' a bill and a gentleman at the same time.",[],0,Charles Dickens,Outasight,2012,"[61, 55, 45, 43, 41, 38, 41, 51, 48, 43, 38, 45, 46, 54, 60, 54]",16,Tonight Is the Night,https://open.spotify.com/track/0tr0D36L1RwPdUTFfyNq37,0tr0D36L1RwPdUTFfyNq37,spotify:track:0tr0D36L1RwPdUTFfyNq37,Tonight Is The Night,2Fp7ppPgW31exiGzUiKqFs,spotify:album:2Fp7ppPgW31exiGzUiKqFs,Outasight,1zuG3w1Zgeou53fb3Vu3bO,spotify:artist:1zuG3w1Zgeou53fb3Vu3bO,190.0,2.0,47.0,2011-09-23,0.625,0.7859999999999999,7.0,-3.8139999999999996,1.0,0.0465,0.0343,1.05e-06,0.20199999999999999,0.537,119.98200000000001,['indie pop rap'],[],

In VIP dem bottle popping do it B.I.G
Come get with T.I.P and be balling til you D.I.E

Girlfriends see your bag, be like where you find that?
Plus, what the fuck's a prenup? You ain't gotta sign that
You nut up, take half, I'ma make it right back
I'm a motherfucking hustler to the heart, what's the

Filled with them stacks you know you gotta love that

Mansions, jewelry, all I need's for you and me to
Have some understanding, have a couple candid conversations
Your frustrations, I take in considerations

And you sadly mistaken if you think I'm into chasing

Sorry for Party Rocking

[Verse 1]
Yo, I be up in a party looking for a hottie to bone
I got a drink in my hand and it's just called buffalo
Poppin' bottles in the house with the models in the V.I.P
All the girls make out for the whole damn club to see

Let's go
People always say that my music's loud
Sorry for party rocking
Neighbors complain saying turn it down!
Sorry for party rocking
Haters don't like we got the spotlight
Sorry for party rocking
When they talk shit, we just be like
Sorry for party rocking

Baby, baby, baby, I'm awfully crazy
Off ciroc, off patron, shit whatever's tasty!

Somebody ran away saying fast as I can
I've got to go, I've got to go
Once upon a time, we fell apart
You're holding in your hands the two halves
Of my heart

Now all we ever seem to do is fight

Once upon a time on the same side
In the same game

Have to go and throw water on my flame

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

[Verse 1]
It’s 8 A.M
This hell I’m in
Seems I’ve crossed the line again
For being nothing more than who I am

So break my bones
And throw your stones
We all know that life ain’t fair
But there is more of us
We’re everywhere

[Pre-Chorus]
We don’t have to take this
Back against the wall
We don’t have to take this
We can end it all

[Chorus]
All you’ll ever be
Is a faded memory of a bully
Make another joke
While they hang another rope
So lonely
Push him to the dirt
‘Til the words don’t hurt
Can you hear me?
No one's gonna cry
On the very day you die
You’re a bully

Hey!
Hey!

[Verse 2]
Think it through
You can’t undo
Whenever I see black and blue
I feel the past
I share the bruise

With everyone
Who’s come and gone
My head is clear
My voice is strong
Now I’m right here to right the wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
We don’t have to take this
Back against the wall
We don’t have to take this
We can end it all

[Chorus]
All you’ll ever be
Is a faded memory of a bully
Make another joke
While they hang another rope
So lonely
Push him to the dirt
‘Til the words don’t hurt
Can you hear me?
No one's gonna cry
On the very day you die
You’re a bully

[Instrumental Solo]

[Bridge]
It’s 8 A.M.!
The Hell I’m in!
Your voice is strong!
Now right the wrong!

[Chorus]

Is a faded memory of a bully
Make another joke
While they hang another rope
So lonely
Push him to the dirt
‘Til the words don’t hurt
Can you hear me?
No ones gonna cry
On the very day you die
You’re a bully

All you’ll ever be
Is a faded memory of a bully
Make another joke
While they hang another rope
So lonely
Push him to the dirt

No ones gonna cry
On the very day you die
You’re a bully

Sitting here feeling kinda crazy
But not just any crazy
It's the kind you feel when you love somebody
And I know that my baby
Is calling somebody else baby
And I can't sit still
Look how gone it got me

Who knew that my heart could have a bruise?
You see this scar here on my chest?
I'm hurting and he don't even care

It's 4 AM and my lover won't answer
He's probably somewhere with a dancer
Sippin' champagne while I'm in his bed

It's 4 AM and I think I might lose it
This mo'fucka thinking I'm stupid
He must've bumped his head
Don't he know it's 4 AM

Standing here and I'm getting heated
Pourin' me up a drink I swear I need it
I think I'm about
'Bout to hurt somebody
Swear this man is begging me to leave
Him
Getting sick of being so mistreated
Another night without..
Without his arms around me

Who knew that my heart could have a
Bruise?
You see this scar here on my chest?
I'm hurting and he don't even care

It's 4 AM and my lover won't answer

He must've bumped his head
Don't he know it's 4 AM

I don't deserve this life
I'd make the perfect wife
And I know love's a sacrifice
But who's gonna sacrifice for me and
Give me all their time and...

I heard that you've settled down
That you'd gone home with no Cup or crown
I heard that your dreams all failed
Guess fate didn't choose for you to prevail
Headlines all against you
Ain't like them to hold back
When they can lie 'bout the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate to be the one to break it to them
But I couldn't stay away, I wasn't patient
I hoped you'd see my point, and that you'd count to ten
Before you leave, it isn't over

[Chorus]
There'll never be someone who played like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't you give up, I beg
Forget what the haters have said
Cause sometimes it's fine in life
But sometimes it's what you dread, yeah
Sometimes it's fine in life
But sometimes it's what you dread

[Verse 2]
You'd know how time flies by
Only yesterday was the time of your life
The seasons were great, it felt like a haze
Bound by the surprise of the awarding days

Nothing compares
Not own goals or dares
Regrets and mistakes
When the memories fade

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out, and then I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark

[Pre-Chorus]
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

[Chorus]
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

[Verse 2]
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you
Now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared

[Pre-Chorus]
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
I can't help feeling

[Chorus]
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
Could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating

[Verse 3]
Throw your soul through every open door (oh-oh)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (whoa-oh)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (oh-oh)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

[Breakdown]
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
We could have had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
It all, it all, it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

[Chorus]
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand

And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)

Bring the beat in

[Verse 1]
Honey, honey
I can see the stars all the way from here
Can't you see the glow on the window pane?
I can feel the sun whenever you're near
Every time you touch me, I just melt away

[Pre-Chorus]
Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear
(They say love hurts) But I know
(It's gonna take a little work) Oh
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it
After fighting through my tears
And finally you put me first

[Chorus 1]
Baby, it's you, you're the one I love
You're the one I need, you're the only one I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you, make everything stop
Finally, you put my love on top

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, come on, baby!
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top
Ooh, come on, baby!
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top

[Verse 2]
Baby, baby, I can feel the wind whipping past my face
As we dance the night away
Boy, your lips taste like a night of champagne
As I kiss you again, and again, and again, and again

[Pre-Chorus]
Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear
(They say love hurts) But I know
(It's gonna take a little work) Oh
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it

And finally you put me first

[Chorus 1]
Baby, it's you, you're the one I love
You're the one I need, you're the only one I see
Come on, baby, it's you (It's you)
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you, make everything stop
Finally, you put my love on top

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, baby!
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top
Ooh, come on, baby!
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top

Baby, it's you, you're the one I love
You're the one I need, you're the only thing I see
Come on, baby, it's you (It's you)

You're the one that always call

Finally, you put my love on top
Baby, you're the one that I love
Baby, you're all I need
You're the only one I see
Come on, baby, it's you

Oh hey, there she go
That's the one I've got to know
Such a cutie, right? Her whole crew is tight
But they don't do it like you
How her hair flows when she walk
Like a Love Jones when she talk
Such a cutie, right? Her whole crew is tight
But they don't do it like you

[Verse 1]
It seems like for a while I’ve know ya
Nostalgic moments, feels like magic don't it?
Girl you killin' 'em, my condolence
That's how you on it? Yeeaaah, that’s how you on it
And I'm gonna be with you no matter what it takes
Running with scissors in the traffic, tryna cut straight to the chase
Wanna be there when you wake, when no make up on your face
Not even gloss, before you brush, love your dimples when you blush
It's the simple things in life we take for granted cause we rush
I just wanna gain your trust as well as me giving you mine
What's yo sign? I'm an Aries, I'm a 90's baby, clearly
I'll make sure to make time for you though my schedule may vary
Hold up, hold up, hold up, I just wanna know ya
I heard 'em say that beauty's in the eyes of the beholder
Well girl my vision’s bad so I'm gon' need you to come closer
Closer, now you right here where you 'pose to

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Excuse me Misses, may I spark your interest?
Cause you sure got my attention, I just wanna grant you wishes (Lala)
What you want you get it, I don't call it tricking
Not just cause I got it cause I want to, that makes all the difference
I'm about my business, and ooh girl you the business
We should get together soon so we can do some business
I got some things that I could teach ya, lemme show ya
Is you ready, what's the hold up?
You ain't 'bout no drama, you remind me of my mama
Smelling like flower balm and escada, shut it down and you won't even try ta
You such a boss but carry yourself like a lady
The baddest out ya crew and that is not up for debating
Hold up, hold up, hold up, I know what they say
Every rapper only want that sexual healing Marvin Gaye
Don't believe it girl, I promise I'mma treat you like my treasure
I'm a movement by myself but I know you'll make me better

And we can leave whenever you say

Watch the sun come up behind our bedroom door

[Chorus: Madonna]
Gimme all your lovin', give me your love
Give me all your love today
Gimme all your lovin', give me your love
Let’s forget about time, and dance our lives away

[Post-Chorus]
L-U-V, Madonna
Y-O-U, you wanna?

[Verse 2: Madonna]
Keep trying, don’t give up, that’s if you want it bad enough
(L-U-V, Madonna)
It’s right in front of you, now tell me what you're thinking of
(Y-O-U, you wanna?)
In another place, at a different time
You can be my lucky star
We can drink some wine, Burgundy is fine
Let’s drink the bottle every drop

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Don’t play the stupid game
'Cause I’m a different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You’ve got to step into my world

[Chorus: Madonna]
Gimme all your lovin', give me your love
Give me all your love today
Gimme all your lovin', give me your love
Let’s forget about time, and dance our lives away

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj (& Madonna)]
(Gimme all your love)
Give me all your love, boy
You can be my boy, you can be my boy toy
In the nick of time, I can say a sicker rhyme
'Cause it's time for change, like a nickel or a dime
(Gimme all your love)
Ugh, I'm Roman, I'm a barbarian, I'm Conan
You was sleeping on me, you were dozin'
Now move, I'm goin' in

[Bridge: Madonna (& Nicki Minaj)]
You have all the L-U-V
I gave you everything you need (Now move!)
Now it’s up to Y-O-U
Are you the one? Shall we proceed?

[Verse 4: M.I.A.]
Move, it! Licks
I’m some swag shit, no one gives you this
It’s supersonic, bionic, uranium hit
So I break ‘em off tricks, let’s pray that it sticks
I'mma say this once, yeah, I don't give a shit

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Don’t play the stupid game
'Cause I’m a different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You’ve got to step into my world

[Chorus: Madonna]
Gimme all your lovin', give me your love
(L-U-V, Madonna)
Gimme all your lovin', give me your love
(Y-O-U, you wanna?)
Gimme all your lovin', give me your love
Gimme all your love today
Gimme all your lovin', give me your love

[Hook - Young Jeezy]
(Yo Cherie we here)
(5 o'clock in the morning)
(Might be 3 though)
I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry(marry)
Gone off the Belvey and ‘tron it’s too scary(scary)
Baby you can have whatever you like, the tooth fairy
I’ll do anything to leave here tonight with you, cherie
I said I do, I do, I do, I do, I do (you know I do)
I said I do I do I do I do I do (you know I do)
I said I do I do I do I do I do (you know I do)
I said I do I do I do I do I do

[Verse 1 - Young Jeezy]
I said now what it is, what it do, homegirl ain't got a clue
If I get you open all the things that I would do to you
Smack it up, flip it down, weigh it up, break it down
Lean you to ya side yeah and ask ya who’s ya daddy now
Ain't even gotta open your eyes, know what your looking at
And I ain't even have to open my eyes when I was cooking that
Guess it was love at first sight, eye contact
Remember the night we first met, I caught a contact
Now she's my ride or die, it’s us against the world
You know we both hustlin’ so hustlin’ is our world
Said I must've had too much to drink I’m in my G-Mode
So all the ladies repeat after me cause it’s the G-Code
Promise if I get locked, you’ll come and pay my bond
If you hear some niggas plotting on me, you’ll ring the alarm
And everytime you give it to me it’s gon be the bomb
And in these unlucky streets you’re gon’ be my lucky charm

[Hook - Young Jeezy]
I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry(marry)
Gone off the Belvey and ‘tron it’s too scary(scary)
Baby you can have whatever you like, the tooth fairy

I said I do, I do, I do, I do, I do (you know I do)
I said I do I do I do I do I do (you know I do)
I said I do I do I do I do I do (you know I do)
(Man, that boy so cold, give him a blanket in here)
I said I do I do I do I do I do
(Yeah)
(yeah)


[Verse 2 - Jay-Z]
I D-O, I D-O, I D-O oh oh
I, Vito, promise to treat this game, i-de-al
Honor the code, not bring drama to mama’s peephole
Life’s a bitch but she's the only love that I know -ow -ow
So la-a-dee, after the “I Do’s” lets do Mercedes
Lets tie the knot, lets grab us a pot, lets make a baby
Looking back, I don’t know who threw this bouquet to me
But I walk down this aisle faithfully, cut that cake for me
I, Jay-Z, take this unlawful lady to have and to hold
And til the task force roll
To hug her every corner til I get ash from the cold
Or until I’ve amassed a fortune, too much cash for me to fold(fold)
Fold under pressure I would never, ever, ever, ever(ever)
Your secret’s I treasure, for better or worse
You’ll always be my first love til death do us part
Pull a hearse up, my verse up

[Hook - Young Jeezy]
I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry(marry)
Gone off the Belvey and ‘tron it’s too scary(scary)
Baby you can have whatever you like, the tooth fairy
I’ll do anything to leave here tonight with you, cherie
I said I do, I do, I do, I do, I do (you know I do)
I said I do I do I do I do I do (you know I do)
I said I do I do I do I do I do (you know I do)
I said I do I do I do I do I do
(Yeah)

[Verse 3 - Andre 3000]
Nothing's more attractive than a heavy praying woman
To a him when those and them been defecating on me (ughh)
Her would sense the heaven, and him when Andre omen
Baby I’m hell, save me, don’t bail
Crazy I tell you all of this in the middle of a club
Where words tend to get thrown around lightly like like, like-like, love
""Friend,"" ""rock star"" and ""So and so’s a genius""
So him vow to never utter him do unless him mean it
Her proud like her mother and ooohh momma’s sweet
So you just know that Juicy fruit ain't gon’ fall too far from tree
So if we ever woopty woop
I want all that bleepty bleep
On this nasty carpet Bixby fresh on one knee
Say I do I do I do I do I do
So we can float up outta here in this hot air balloon
Lets put a baby butterfly up in your lil’ cocoon
And maybe 2030 our baby, she’ll be nerdy make the whole club swoon

[Andre 3000 Talking]
She'll love books and cook and look just like you
And when she's done being young, she'll dress like you
We'll call her Love 22, she'll tote a 22, the laser version","['baby', 'you', 'can', 'have', 'whatever', 'you', 'like', 'the', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'i’ll', 'do', 'anything', 'to', 'leave', 'here', 'tonight', 'with', 'you', 'cherie', 'i', 'say', 'i', 'do', 'i', 'do', 'i', 'do', 'i', 'do', 'i', 'do', 'i', 'say', 'now', 'what', 'it', 'be', 'what', 'it', 'do', 'homegirl', 'aint', 'get', 'a', 'clue', 'if', 'i', 'get', 'you', 'open', 'all', 'the', 'things', 'that', 'i', 'would', 'do', 'to', 'you', 'smack', 'it', 'up', 'flip', 'it', 'down', 'weigh', 'it', 'up', 'break', 'it', 'down', 'lean', 'you', 'to', 'ya', 'side', 'yeah', 'and', 'ask', 'ya', 'who’s', 'ya', 'daddy', 'now', 'aint', 'even', 'gotta', 'open', 'your', 'eye', 'know', 'what', 'your', 'look', 'at', 'and', 'i', 'aint', 'even', 'have', 'to', 'open', 'my', 'eye', 'when', 'i', 'be', 'cook', 'that', 'guess', 'it', 'be', 'love', 'at', 'first', 'sight', 'eye', 'contact', 'remember', 'the', 'night', 'we', 'first', 'meet', 'i', 'catch', 'a', 'contact', 'now', 'shes', 'my', 'ride', 'or', 'die', 'it’s', 'us', 'against', 'the', 'world', 'you', 'know', 'we', 'both', 'hustlin’', 'so', 'hustlin’', 'be', 'our', 'world', 'say', 'i', 'mustve', 'have', 'too', 'much', 'to', 'drink', 'i’m', 'in', 'my', 'gmode', 'so', 'all', 'the', 'ladies', 'repeat', 'after', 'me', 'cause', 'it’s', 'the', 'gcode', 'promise', 'if', 'i', 'get', 'lock', 'you’ll', 'come', 'and', 'pay', 'my', 'bond', 'if', 'you', 'hear', 'some', 'niggas', 'plot', 'on', 'me', 'you’ll', 'ring', 'the', 'alarm', 'and', 'everytime', 'you', 'give', 'it', 'to', 'me', 'it’s', 'gon', 'be', 'the', 'bomb', 'and', 'in', 'these', 'unlucky', 'streets', 'you’re', 'gon’', 'be', 'my', 'lucky', 'charm', 'baby', 'you', 'can', 'have', 'whatever', 'you', 'like', 'the', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'i’ll', 'do', 'anything', 'to', 'leave', 'here', 'tonight', 'with', 'you', 'cherie', 'i', 'say', 'i', 'do', 'i', 'do', 'i', 'do', 'i', 'do', 'i', 'do', 'i', 'do', 'i', 'do', 'i', 'do', 'oh', 'oh', 'i', 'vito', 'promise', 'to', 'treat', 'this', 'game', 'ideal', 'honor', 'the', 'code', 'not', 'bring', 'drama', 'to', 'mama’s', 'peephole', 'life’s', 'a', 'bitch', 'but', 'shes', 'the', 'only', 'love', 'that', 'i', 'know', 'ow', 'ow', 'so', 'laadee', 'after', 'the', '“i', 'do’s”', 'let', 'do', 'mercedes', 'let', 'tie', 'the', 'knot', 'let', 'grab', 'us', 'a', 'pot', 'let', 'make', 'a', 'baby', 'look', 'back', 'i', 'don’t', 'know', 'who', 'throw', 'this', 'bouquet', 'to', 'me', 'but', 'i', 'walk', 'down', 'this', 'aisle', 'faithfully', 'cut', 'that', 'cake', 'for', 'me', 'i', 'jayz', 'take', 'this', 'unlawful', 'lady', 'to', 'have', 'and', 'to', 'hold', 'and', 'til', 'the', 'task', 'force', 'roll', 'to', 'hug', 'her', 'every', 'corner', 'til', 'i', 'get', 'ash', 'from', 'the', 'cold', 'your', 'secret’s', 'i', 'treasure', 'for', 'better', 'or', 'worse', 'you’ll', 'always', 'be', 'my', 'first', 'love', 'til', 'death', 'do', 'us', 'part', 'pull', 'a', 'hearse', 'up', 'my', 'verse', 'up', 'baby', 'you', 'can', 'have', 'whatever', 'you', 'like', 'the', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'i’ll', 'do', 'anything', 'to', 'leave', 'here', 'tonight', 'with', 'you', 'cherie', 'i', 'say', 'i', 'do', 'i', 'do', 'i', 'do', 'i', 'do', 'i', 'do', 'nothings', 'more', 'attractive', 'than', 'a', 'heavy', 'pray', 'woman', 'her', 'would', 'sense', 'the', 'heaven', 'and', 'him', 'when', 'andre', 'omen', 'baby', 'i’m', 'hell', 'save', 'me', 'don’t', 'bail', 'crazy', 'i', 'tell', 'you', 'all', 'of', 'this', 'in', 'the', 'middle', 'of', 'a', 'club', 'where', 'word', 'tend', 'to', 'get', 'throw', 'around', 'lightly', 'like', 'like', 'likelike', 'love', 'friend', 'rock', 'star', 'and', 'so', 'and', 'so’s', 'a', 'genius', 'so', 'him', 'vow', 'to', 'never', 'utter', 'him', 'do', 'unless', 'him', 'mean', 'it', 'her', 'proud', 'like', 'her', 'mother', 'and', 'ooohh', 'momma’s', 'sweet', 'so', 'you', 'just', 'know', 'that', 'juicy', 'fruit', 'aint', 'gon’', 'fall', 'too', 'far', 'from', 'tree', 'so', 'if', 'we', 'ever', 'woopty', 'woop', 'i', 'want', 'all', 'that', 'bleepty', 'bleep', 'on', 'this', 'nasty', 'carpet', 'bixby', 'fresh', 'on', 'one', 'knee', 'say', 'i', 'do', 'i', 'do', 'i', 'do', 'i', 'do', 'i', 'do', 'so', 'we', 'can', 'float', 'up', 'outta', 'here', 'in', 'this', 'hot', 'air', 'balloon', 'let', 'put', 'a', 'baby', 'butterfly', 'up', 'in', 'your', 'lil’', 'cocoon', 'and', 'maybe', '2030', 'our', 'baby', 'she’ll', 'be', 'nerdy', 'make', 'the', 'whole', 'club', 'swoon', 'shell', 'love', 'book', 'and', 'cook', 'and', 'look', 'just', 'like', 'you', 'and', 'when', 'shes', 'do', 'be', 'young', 'shell', 'dress', 'like', 'you', 'well', 'call', 'her', 'love', '22', 'shell', 'tote', 'a', '22', 'the', 'laser', 'version']",614,Jeezy,Young Jeezy Featuring Jay-Z & Andre 3000,2012,"[96, 98, 99, 95, 91, 88, 82, 70, 68, 70, 76, 75, 75, 77, 61]",15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0
344,344,Mr. Wrong,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Don’t it seem like
Like I’m always there when it matters
But missing most of the other time
A terrible pattern
The rewards I see from working
Made me an addict
There's way more people that want it
Than people that have it
I don't get it, I would hate to think I tricked ‘em
They fall victim to my system
Guess I sure know how to pick em
And I’m always her regret
Yeah, I’m always her regret
And I always make it harder on whoever’s coming next
It goes up and down, it’s just up and down
She’s crying now but she’ll laugh again
Cause we on the rise and she here with us
And expensive shit, just keeps happening
She loves it, she stares at me like who does this
And we hold hands while I pray that she’s not the type to hold grudges
I’m wrong..

[Verse 2: Mary J Blige]
Bad boys ain't no good
Good boys ain't no fun
Lord knows that I should
Run off with the right one

[Chorus: Mary J Blige]
Me and Mr. Wrong get along so good (so good)
Even though he breaks my heart so bad (so bad)
We got a special thing going on
Me and Mr. Wrong (Mr. Wrong)
Even if I try, no, I never could
Give him up cause his loves like that
Ain't no way that I’m moving on
I love my Mr. Wrong

[Verse 3: Mary J Blige]
Hung up off your good
You call and I run
My fam' is screaming at me don’t do it
""Don't do it, Mary!""
I guess they never had none

[Chorus: Mary J Blige]
Me and Mr. Wrong get along so good (so good)
Even though he breaks my heart so bad (so bad)
We got a special thing going on(going on)
Me and Mr. Wrong (Mr. Wrong)
Even if I try, no, I never could
Give him up cause his loves like that
Ain't no way that I’m moving on
I love my Mr. Wrong

[Bridge: Mary J Blige]
When he put that loving on me, I can’t think of nothing
That’ll make me walk out
I’m holding on
I love my Mr. Wrong
He be kissing and touching on me
I can’t help but love him
I must be out my mind
For going so strong
I love my Mr. Wrong
Mr. Wrong

[Chorus: Mary J Blige]
Me and Mr. Wrong get along so good (so good)
Even though he breaks my heart so bad (so bad)

345,345,Naked,"[Verse 1: Dev & Enrique Iglesias]
You got a girl that doesn't look a thing like me
The girl your mother always said it would be
So, you could say that, you could say that I'm hopeless
But that ain't the girl, that ain't the girl I want you to be
The girl that keeps me up and I see in my dreams
So, you could say that, you could say that I love her

[Pre-Chorus: Dev & Enrique Iglesias]
So I don't care what they say, it's our life, life, life
We can dance if we want, make it feel alright
Temperature's rising, I feel the fire
Tonight, it's just me and you

[Chorus: Dev & Enrique Iglesias, Both]
Tell me baby, will you be here when I wake up?
Even with no make up, I don't wanna fake it
And you don't gotta doubt a second if I miss you
Every time I'm with you, I feel naked

[Post-Chorus: Dev & Enrique Iglesias]
(Hey!)
I feel naked
I want it, so let me get it
You say you got it, what you gon' do with it?

[Verse 2: Enrique Iglesias & Dev]
If I told you, ""Girl, come and run away with me""
Now would you throw it all away for me?
I need to know that, need to know that it's not over
'Cause you were the boy Daddy told you to stay away from me
But you're nothing but a fantasy
I need to know that, need to know that
You'd be strong enough to believe in us

[Chorus: Dev & Enrique Iglesias]
Cause I don't care what they say, it's our life, life, life
We can dance if we want, make it feel alright
Temperature's rising, I feel the fire
Tonight, it's just me and you

[Chorus: Dev & Enrique Iglesias, Both]
Tell me baby, will you be here when I wake up?
Even with no make up, I don't wanna fake it
And you don't gotta doubt a second if I miss you
Every time I'm with you, I feel naked

[Post-Chorus: Dev & Enrique Iglesias]
(Hey!)
I feel naked
I want it, so let me get it
You say you got it, what you gon' do with it?

[Bridge: Dev & Enrique Iglesias, Both]
I don't care what they say, it's our life, life, life
We can dance if we want, make it feel alright
Temperature's rising, I feel the fire
Tonight, it's just me and you

346,346,Ours,"[Verse 1]
Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you

[Chorus]
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

[Verse 2]
You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine

[Chorus]
And you'll say
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

[Bridge]
And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong
And your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong
And I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
With this song for you

[Breakdown]
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Will be ignored
'Cause my heart is yours

[Chorus]
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours

Men jeg kan ikke akseptere at vi er fremmedgjorte
Uten deg, uten deg
Jeg kan ikke slutte nå, dette kan ikke stemme
Jeg kan ikke ta en søvnløs natt til
Uten deg, uten deg

Jeg vil ikke ha svevet, jeg vil ikke ha klatret
Hvis du ikke er her, er jeg lammet
Uten deg, uten deg
Jeg kan ikke se, jeg er så blind
Jeg har mistet mitt hjerte, jeg har mistet mitt sinn

For me it's a beach bar
Or on a boat underneath the stars
Or with my band up on a stage
For a while everything's okay
For some it's a fast car
Moonshine in a Mason jar
And everybody has their way
Somehow to escape

[Chorus]
Reality, yeah, sometimes life
It is not all that it's cracked up to be
So let's take a chance and live this fantasy
Because everybody needs to break free from reality (yeah yeah)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, some days it's a bitch, it's a bummer
We need a rock and roll show in the summer
To let the music take us away
Take our minds to a better place
Where we feel that sense of freedom
Leave our worries behind, we don't need them
All we need is a sunny day and an old tailgate
And we'll escape

[Chorus]
Reality, yeah, sometimes life
It is not all that it's cracked up to be
So let's take a chance and live this fantasy
Because everybody needs to break free from reality

Everybody raise your hands and voice tonight
Set your soul free, let's take a carpet ride
We'll leave it all behind

I came up out of the water
Raised my hands up to the Father
Gave it all to him that day
Felt a new wind kiss my face
Walked away, Eyes wide open
Could finally see where I was going
It didn't matter where I'd been
I'm not the same man I was then

[Chorus]
I got off track
I made mistakes
Back slid my way
Into that place
Where souls get lost
Lines get crossed
And the pain won’t go away
I hit my knees
Now here I stand
There I was
Now here I am
Here I am
Changed

[Verse 2: Gary]
I got a lot of “Hey, I’m sorry's""
The things I’ve done
Man, that was not me
I wish that I could take it all back
I just want to tell em’ that
Tell 'em that

[Chorus]
I got off track
I made mistakes
Back slid my way

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Jay-Z]
Hello, hello, hello, hello, white America, assassinate my character
Money matrimony, yeah, they tryna break the marriage up
Who gon' act phony, or who gon' try to embarrass ya?
I'ma need a day off, I think I'll call Ferris up
Bueller had a Muller but I switched it for a Mille
'Cause I’m richer, and prior to this shit, was movin' free base
Had a conference with the DJs (Yeah?), Puerto Rico three days
Poli with the PDs, now they got our shit on replay
Sorry I’m in pajamas but I just got off the PJ
And last party we had, they shut down Prive
Ain’t that where the Heat play? (Yeah)
Niggas hate ballers these days (Yeah)
Ain’t that like LeBron James?
Ain’t that just like D-Wade? Wait

[Sample: James Brown]
What you need, what–what you need

[Verse 2: Jay-Z & Kanye West]
Wussup, wussup, wussup, wussup
Wussup, muh'fucka? Where my money at?
You gon' make me come down to your house where yo' mommy at
Mummy wrap the kids, have ‘em cryin’ for they mommy back
Dummy that your daddy is, tell 'em I just want my racks
Racks on racks on racks (Racks!)
Maybachs on bachs on bachs on bachs on bachs
Who in that? Oh shit, it’s just blacks on blacks on blacks
Hunnid stack–How you get it? Nigga layin’ raps on tracks
I wish I could give you this feeling, I’m planking on a million
I’m riding through yo' hood, you can bank I ain’t got no ceiling
Made a left on Nostrand Ave., (Right), we in Bed Stuy
Made a right on 79th, I’m coming down South Shore Drive
I remain Chi-town, Brooklyn ‘til I die

I want to see you work out for me, work out for me

[Chorus]
Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then

[Bridge]
Let me see you get high, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)
High, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)

[Verse 1]
She like them boys with the big ol' chains
Ridin' around town in a big ol' Range
I knew her when I rocked big ol' jeans
Now the little nigga doin' big ol' thangs
Would you look at that? I came back for her
Just to give it to ya, like you asked for it
Man, that thing in them jeans too fat for her
Rebounds so I caught her off the backboard
I told her: “Baby girl, come here
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there.”
And I brag hardly, but just to show up at this party
I made what yo' nigga make in one year
That's unfair, but so is life, take a chance, roll the dice
Money can’t buy you love, 'cause it’s overpriced
Don’t overthink, just hope it's right
I’m only here for the night

[Chorus]
Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then

[Bridge]
Let me see you get high, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)
High, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)

[Verse 2]
Carolina Blue kicks, fresh on the scene
Hottest nigga on the block
Damn, girl, you're mean
They be startin' shit, but it’s yo' world
On my Martin shit: “You go, girl!”
She bad and she know it
Some niggas save hoes, I’m not that heroic
Could you be my escort?
'Cause just like them two door Fords
Damn, they don’t make 'em like you no more
Cole World, real Cole World
Them boys cool—me, I’m on fire
Know what's on my mind
Tryna see what's on yours tonight, tonight, tonight
Move slow, 'cause you wanna live fast
Up late so you'll probably skip class
Life is a test so before the night pass, get right, get right

[Chorus]
Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then (Cole World)

[Outro]

Do you really wanna love me forever? (Oh oh oh)
Or is it just a hit-and-run?
(Well, hey) Straight up, I tell ya
I just really wanna cut when we together (Oh oh oh)

360,360,Lotus Flower Bomb,"[Intro: Wale & Miguel]
I'ma rap to you real quick
I wanna enjoy the luxury of like
Not knowing each other for real
Hol' up
Lotus flower bomb firefly
When I'm low, she take me high
I can teach you all the sounds of love

[Verse 1: Wale]
Flowerbomb, let me guess your favorite fragrance
And you got that bomb, huh, I'm tryna detonate you
No disrespecting baby, just tryna make you smile
Try to keep my spirits up, that's why I lays it down
Try to keep your spirits up, lil vodka whatever
Took you forever to get dressed, I acknowledge your effort
So I clap for her, she deserves an applause
Shawty working so hard, she deserve that Vuitton
Shawty where your baton, racing through my mind like
She heard that I got that work, I heard that she been on strike
Care to tell, I read your mind, she been on them dollars first
Caramel macchiatos when shawty get into work
I can be your boyfriend, be your nigga or a friend with perks
I'm just tryna work that huh, they just tryna work your nerves
I'm just tryna read your mind, I'm just tryna feed you mine
I'm just tryna give you light, they just tryna leave you blind

[Hook: Miguel]
We're living in a fantasy
I feel it when you dance with me
It's feeling like you need to be
My lady, my baby, yeah
Can't you see
I'm talking about eternity
Tell me would you care to be
My lady, my baby

[Verse 2: Wale]
Flower bomb, can I blow up on your mind
This is not no Sandra Bull, but you're Potion #9
Navigating through her eyes, destination to her thighs
And I hate to tell you too much, cuz I stay with too much pride
And we way too young to know love, maybe not but we don't need no rush
Don't believe in love at first sight, but I believe in love at first huh
Can I be with you just one night, I could wear you out inside
I could tell you like persistence, but I make you cum in tri's
I just think we need one night, can't decide if I came right
Easy baby my thing tight, but that lotus flower just ain't right
I ain't thinking I ain't right, can't decide but I can't fight
Easy baby, you the bomb and all, but I be damned if I do not land mine
Or at least try, can I speak up? was it peace out? can we eat lunch?
Can we take shots? What's your flavor? Flat drinks we call A cups
I just think I need one night, slightly more if it's done right
With that gorgeous face, I don't know your name, it ain't important babe 'cause I'ma call you Mine

[Hook: Miguel]
We're living in a fantasy
I feel it when you dance with me
It's feeling like you need to be
My lady, my baby, yeah
Can't you see
I'm talking about eternity
Tell me would you care to be
My lady, my baby

[Bridge: Miguel]
'Cause I don’t know you, you don’t know me
The clock keeps ticking baby what's it gonna be
I don’t know you, you don’t know me
Let me teach you all the sounds of love

361,361,Red Solo Cup,"Hey, one, two, three

[Verse 1]
Now, red Solo cup is the best receptacle
For barbecues, tailgates, fairs, and festivals
And you, sir, do not have a pair of testicles
If you prefer drinking from glass
Hey, red Solo cup is cheap and disposable
And in 14 years, they are decomposable
And unlike my home, they are not foreclosable
Freddy Mac can kiss my ass
Whoo!

[Chorus]
Red Solo cup
I fill you up
Let's have a party
Let's have a party
I love you, red Solo cup
I lift you up
Proceed to party
Proceed to party

[Verse 2]
Now, I really love how you're easy to stack
But I really hate how you're easy to crack
'Cause when beer runs down in front of my pack
Well, that, my friends, is quite yucky
But I have to admit that the ladies get smitten
Admiring at how sharply my first name is written
On you with a Sharpie when I get to hitting
On them to help me get lucky

But only you, red, will do for this fellow
'Cause you are the Abbott to my Costello
And you are the Fruit to my Loom
Red Solo cup, you're more than just plastic
You're more than amazing, you're more than fantastic
And believe me that I am not the least bit sarcastic
When I look at you and say

362,362,The Trouble With Girls,"[Verse 1]
The trouble with girls is they’re a mystery
Something about ’em puzzles me
Spent my whole life trying to figure out
Just what them girls are all about
The trouble with girls is they're so dang pretty
Everything about ’em does something to me
But I guess that’s the way it’s supposed to be

[Chorus]
They smile, that smile
They bat those eyes
They steal you with ""hello""
They kill you with ""goodbye""
They hook you with one touch and you can’t break free
Yeah, the trouble with girls is nobody loves trouble as much as me

[Verse 2]
They’re sugar and spice and angel wings
And hell on wheels and tight blue jeans
A summer night, down by the lake
An old memory that you can’t shake
They’re hard to find, yet there’s so many of ’em
The way that you hate, that you already love ’em
But I guess that’s the way it’s supposed to be

[Chorus]
They smile, that smile
They bat those eyes
They steal you with ""hello""
They kill you with ""goodbye""
They hook you with one touch and you can’t break free
Yeah, the trouble with girls is nobody loves trouble as much as me

[Bridge]
The way they hold you out on the dance floor
The way they ride in the middle of your truck
The way they give you a kiss at the front door
Leave you wishing you could have gone up
And just as you walk away
You hear that sweet voice say…
Stay

[Chorus]
They smile, that smile
They bat those eyes
They steal you with ""hello""
They kill you with ""goodbye""
They hook you with one touch and you can’t break free
Yeah, the trouble with girls is nobody loves trouble as much as me","['the', 'trouble', 'with', 'girls', 'be', 'they’re', 'a', 'mystery', 'something', 'about', '’em', 'puzzle', 'me', 'spend', 'my', 'whole', 'life', 'try', 'to', 'figure', 'out', 'just', 'what', 'them', 'girls', 'be', 'all', 'about', 'the', 'trouble', 'with', 'girls', 'be', 'theyre', 'so', 'dang', 'pretty', 'everything', 'about', '’em', 'do', 'something', 'to', 'me', 'but', 'i', 'guess', 'that’s', 'the', 'way', 'it’s', 'suppose', 'to', 'be', 'they', 'smile', 'that', 'smile', 'they', 'bat', 'those', 'eye', 'they', 'steal', 'you', 'with', 'hello', 'they', 'kill', 'you', 'with', 'goodbye', 'they', 'hook', 'you', 'with', 'one', 'touch', 'and', 'you', 'can’t', 'break', 'free', 'yeah', 'the', 'trouble', 'with', 'girls', 'be', 'nobody', 'love', 'trouble', 'as', 'much', 'as', 'me', 'they’re', 'sugar', 'and', 'spice', 'and', 'angel', 'wing', 'and', 'hell', 'on', 'wheel', 'and', 'tight', 'blue', 'jeans', 'a', 'summer', 'night', 'down', 'by', 'the', 'lake', 'an', 'old', 'memory', 'that', 'you', 'can’t', 'shake', 'they’re', 'hard', 'to', 'find', 'yet', 'there’s', 'so', 'many', 'of', '’em', 'the', 'way', 'that', 'you', 'hate', 'that', 'you', 'already', 'love', '’em', 'but', 'i', 'guess', 'that’s', 'the', 'way', 'it’s', 'suppose', 'to', 'be', 'they', 'smile', 'that', 'smile', 'they', 'bat', 'those', 'eye', 'they', 'steal', 'you', 'with', 'hello', 'they', 'kill', 'you', 'with', 'goodbye', 'they', 'hook', 'you', 'with', 'one', 'touch', 'and', 'you', 'can’t', 'break', 'free', 'yeah', 'the', 'trouble', 'with', 'girls', 'be', 'nobody', 'love', 'trouble', 'as', 'much', 'as', 'me', 'the', 'way', 'they', 'hold', 'you', 'out', 'on', 'the', 'dance', 'floor', 'the', 'way', 'they', 'ride', 'in', 'the', 'middle', 'of', 'your', 'truck', 'the', 'way', 'they', 'give', 'you', 'a', 'kiss', 'at', 'the', 'front', 'door', 'leave', 'you', 'wish', 'you', 'could', 'have', 'go', 'up', 'and', 'just', 'as', 'you', 'walk', 'away', 'you', 'hear', 'that', 'sweet', 'voice', 'say…', 'stay', 'they', 'smile', 'that', 'smile', 'they', 'bat', 'those', 'eye', 'they', 'steal', 'you', 'with', 'hello', 'they', 'kill', 'you', 'with', 'goodbye', 'they', 'hook', 'you', 'with', 'one', 'touch', 'and', 'you', 'can’t', 'break', 'free', 'yeah', 'the', 'trouble', 'with', 'girls', 'be', 'nobody', 'love', 'trouble', 'as', 'much', 'as', 'me']",291,Scotty McCreery,Scotty McCreery,2012,"[90, 81, 87, 83, 76, 84, 79, 78, 80, 66, 58, 55]",12,The Trouble With Girls,https://open.spotify.com/track/0Yvyj5YkjSBNgD4Ai0clSG,0Yvyj5YkjSBNgD4Ai0clSG,spotify:track:0Yvyj5YkjSBNgD4Ai0clSG,Clear As Day,0molQ0VuhniiiYNZ1iAJrc,spotify:album:0molQ0VuhniiiYNZ1iAJrc,Scotty McCreery,6ZV6lGY0prbqpTD0Md8i29,spotify:artist:6ZV6lGY0prbqpTD0Md8i29,229.57299999999998,12.0,52.0,2011-01-01,0.5539999999999999,0.496,10.0,-7.266,1.0,0.0281,0.391,0.0,0.109,0.35100000000000003,132.078,"['contemporary country', 'country', 'country road', 'modern country rock']",[],1.0

Life's too short to even care at all, whoa oh-oh
I'm losing my mind, losing my mind, losing control
These fishes in the sea, they're staring at me
Whoa oh-oh, oh, whoa-oh, oh
A wet world aches for a beat of a drum, oh-whoa oh, oh

[Chorus 1]
If I could find a way to see this straight
I'd run away to some fortune that
I, I should have found
By now
I'm waiting for this cough syrup
To come down, come down

Life's too short to even care at all, oh-whoa, oh
I'm coming up now, coming up now
Out of the blue, oh-oh, oh-oh
These zombies in the park, they're looking for my heart
Oh-whoa, oh, whoa-oh, oh
A dark world aches for a splash of the sun
Oh-whoa oh, oh, oh

[Chorus 2]
If I could find a way to see this straight
I'd run away, to some fortune that
I, I should have found
By now
And so I run now to the things they said could restore me
Restore life the way it should be

You're not alone, my friend
So fill up your cup and lift your lighter
And toast to life
They say what don't kill me can make me stronger
So two drinks at night should help me live longer
I blow some smoke just to give my lungs a test
Cause why tic toc to life
To arrive safely at death
I'm on a journey, yeah I'm on a road
Sometimes I gotta close my eyes
Just to open my soul
And tonight is the night
I got a feeling that I'm about to act a fool
So if you go fix some drinks
Me and usher are about to break some rules
Got somewhere to go but the world is moving slow
I was born for the fast life
I go for all, and yes I'm not here to fall
But for what it's worth I'm ready to play
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
If I got one life to live, I'mma party til I'm dead
What the hell is a life worth living if it's not on the edge
Tryna keep my balance I'm twisted so just in case I fall
Ring on my tomb, don't you say women, weed and alcohol

Freeze the haste of time

365,365,I Don't Want This Night To End,"[Verse 1]
Girl I know I don’t know you
But your pretty little eyes so blue
Are pulling me in
Like the moon on your skin
I’m so glad you trusted me
To slide up on this dusty seat
And let your hair down
Get out of town

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Got the stars coming out over my hood
And all I know now is it's going good

[Chorus]
You got your hands up
You’re rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You’re singing every song
I’m set on cruise control
I’m slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
You’re looking so damn hot

[Post-Chorus]
And I don’t know what road we’re on
Or where we’ve been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I don’t want this night to end

[Verse 2]
Going to cuss the morning when it comes
'Cause I know that the rising sun
Ain’t no good for me
'Cause you’ll have to leave
Going to make the most of every mile
Do anything to make your smile
Land on my lips
Get drunk on your kiss

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Clock on the dash says 3:35
There’s plenty of gas and the night’s still alive

[Chorus]
You got your hands up
You’re rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You’re singing every song
I’m set on cruise control
I’m slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
You’re looking so damn hot

[Post-Chorus]
And I don’t know what road we’re on
Or where we’ve been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I don’t want this night to end

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
You got your hands up
You’re rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You’re singing every song
I’m set on cruise control
I’m slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
You’re looking so damn hot

[Post-Chorus]
And I don’t know what road we’re on
Or where we’ve been
From staring at you girl

The bluest skies don't seem so blue
And the stars seem to be a little dimmer too
Now that you're around, you put 'em all to shame
Let me break it down 'cause what I'm trying to say is

[Chorus]
No one gets me like you when you kiss me
Girl, you rock me harder than some downtown band
I thought I knew what love was but I didn't have a clue
I never found anything that makes me feel like I do about you

[Verse 2]
Gotta whole new direction, it seems, these days
I used to rush off to work and get home late
But now I show up late and rush back home
My priorities are different, I can't leave you alone

[Chorus]
No one gets me like you when you kiss me
Girl, you rock me harder than some downtown band
I thought I knew what love was but I didn't have a clue
I never found anything that makes me feel like I do about you

[Bridge]
Girl, if you ever get to guessing if I'm thinking 'bout you
Just remember that

Yo, I guess I went commercial, just shot a commercial
When I flew to the set, though, I ain’t fly commercial
And the ad is global; your ad was local
When we shot it was a lot of different agriculturals
So I laugh at hopefuls; ""Nicki pop!""
Only thing that’s pop is my endorsement, akh
Fuck around and I'll have to go and reinforce the Glock

You mad ’cause I’m at the Grammys with the Vatican
You in the booth, but I'm who you be channelin’
Why they never bring you name up at the panel, then?
Hottest MCs, top five
You need money? I got mine

Got a body on my gun, fuck the world with my thumb
Pop a molly, smoke a blunt, that mean I'm a high roller

Two hoes in the bed, tell them hoes, slide over
Excuse my French, two bitches and moi

When you die you can’t take it with ya
Bottle of Rose if I’m drinking with ya
Cause most niggas is broke, they bank is injured
Them bitches gonna ride with who they think’s a winner
And I’ll be smiling in case they take a picture
Oh, I’m smoking weed, drinking liquor, make a hundred
On a show spend it all on my niggas
When I go shopping I tell them pick one
Cause they was with me when nobody seen a vision
Always about my business, don’t play the cards
I talked to the niggas who dealed them, uhh
Royal flush, now look up them niggas and baby girl you see us, yeah

Poke til it's bruisin' dick on punta gimme gimme chocha kill it like OJ, ah

370,370,Thank You,"Sometimes I wonder… Do you
Even recognize the woman
That’s standing in front of you

Sometimes I wonder… Do you
Even care or realize why I took care of you
‘Cuz you’re my heart
You are my soul
You’re my other half
Without you I can not be whole baby
So far apart
I just don’t know
What drove us apart in the first place
Now I know why

These tears I cry … sure won’t be the last
They will not be the last .. no
This pain inside… never seems to pass
It never seems to pass… me by

So I thank you
Said I thank you
Yes I thank you
For making me a woman

Sometimes I wonder… could she be
More of a woman to you thank you were a man to me
Sometime I wonder .. why me
I’m here miserable while you’re out living your fantasies
And didn’t care

‘Cuz you’re my heart
You are my soul
You’re my other half
Without you I can not be whole baby
So far apart

What drove us apart in the first place

They will not be the last .. no

So I thank you
Said I thank you
Yes I thank you
For making me a woman

One thing I learned in life
We all gotta go through to survive
I hope she’s happy
‘Cuz you’re the chapter that I’ll be closing
Hope you’re happy
‘Cuz once my door closes it won’t be open

These tears I cry … sure won’t be the last
They will not be the last .. no

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no—
Oh—ote
Make me your radio (Yeah, ha ha)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up a little bit)
This melody was meant for you (Right there)
Just sing along to my stereo (Gym Class Heroes, baby!)

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I ask you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like yikky-yeah check it, Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

[Pre-Chorus 1: Travie McCoy]
If I could only find a note to make you understand
I’d sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Travie McCoy]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no— (Yeah)
Oh—ote (Yeah, yeah, come on)
Make me your radio (Uh-uh)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up)
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh, oh oh-oh, oh
Oh oh-oh (To my stereo)
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Just sing along to my stereo
Let's go!

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
If I was an old-school, fifty-pound boombox (Remember them?)
Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk?
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops? (Turn it up)
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop (Peace)
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know, we come and go like on the interstate (Never know)

[Pre-Chorus 2: Travie McCoy]
I think I finally found a note to make you understand
If you could hit it, sing along and take me by the hand
Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

Oh, oh oh-oh, oh (Yeah)
Oh oh-oh (To my stereo)
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Just sing along to my stereo

[Bridge: Adam Levine & Travie McCoy]
I only pray you never leave me behind (Never leave me)
Because good music can be so hard to find (So hard to find)
I take your hand and hold it closer to mine (Yeah)
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind (Yeah, yeah, come on)

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
My heart's a stereo (Yeah)
It beats for you, so listen close

373,373,Make Me Proud,"[Verse 1: Drake]
I like a woman with a future and a past
A little attitude problem all good, it’ll make the shit last
Don’t make it too easy, girl, don’t take it too fast
Yeah, that's it right there
That's it, do it just like that
Only you can do it just like that
And I love it when your hair still
Wet cause you just took a shower
Running on a treadmill and only eating salad
Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard
Knowing you, weekend in Miami trying to study by the pool
Couple things due but you always get it done
Might've been a time when I loved her too
But you take that away and you’ve always been the one
One, I wonder why the moon looks nice, girl
Maybe it’s just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl
They want you in their life as a wife
That's why you want to have no sex, why you want to protest
Why you want to fight for your right
Cause you don’t love them boys
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise

[Chorus: Drake]
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Can’t you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
It’s just amazing, girl, and all I can say is
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you

[Post-Chorus: Drake]
Everything’s adding up, you’ve been through hell and back
That's why you’re bad as fuck and you—

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
B-b-b-bet I am
All of them bitches I’m badder than
Mansions in Malibu, Babylon
But I never mention everything I dabble in
And I always ride slow when I’m straddling
And my shit’s so wet you gotta paddle in
Gotta r-r-row, gotta row ya boat
It’s Pink Friday Records and OVO
Done did the pop tour, I’m the realest still
The best legal team so the deals is ill
It’s MAC, OPI, and a fragrance, too
Apparel, I’m dominating every avenue
Cobblestone, good view, little gravel too
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too
Cause I’m fl-fl-fly I'm flying high
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitch
But baby, if you ask me to take a break
I’ll give it all away, don’t care what the people say
I’ll be a million, billion, trillion miles away aha
He asked my sign, I said a Sag’
I’m a star: sheriff badge
What's the point if I’m guarding?
Double-D up, hoes: Dolly Parton

[Chorus: Drake]
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Can’t you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
It’s just amazing, girl, all I can say is
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you

[Post-Chorus: Drake]
Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as fuck and you know you are

[Chorus: Drake]
And I know all I can say is
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
And I know all I can say is
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  I'm so
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you

[Post-Chorus: Drake]

That's why you're bad as fuck and you know you are","['i', 'like', 'a', 'woman', 'with', 'a', 'future', 'and', 'a', 'past', 'a', 'little', 'attitude', 'problem', 'all', 'good', 'it’ll', 'make', 'the',

374,374,Fly / I Believe I Can Fly,"Rachel:
I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise

Rachel with New Directions Girls (Santana):
To fly
To fly (Uh, yo, yo)

Artie:
I used to think that I could not go on

Santana:
I wish today it would rain all day
Maybe that will kinda make the pain go away

Artie:
And life was nothing but an awful song

Santana (New Directions Boys):
They got their guns out aiming at me
But I become Neo when they aiming at me (If I can see it)

Blaine (New Directions Boys):
Me, me, me against them
Me against enemies, me against friends (Then I can do it)
Somehow they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood (If I just believe it)
They start coming and I start rising
Must be surprising, I'm just surmising (There's nothing to it)

Blaine and Santana:
I win, thrive, soar
Higher, higher, higher
More fire

Rachel and Santana (Rachel):
(I came to win), to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise

Finn with New Directions Boys (Rachel and New Directions Girls):
I believe I can fly (Fly)
I believe I can touch the sky
I believe I can fly (Fly)
I believe I can touch the sky

Artie:
See, I was on the verge of breaking down

Santana:
Paint they own pictures, then they crop me in
But I will remain where the top begins

Artie:
Sometimes silence can seem so loud

Santana (New Directions Boys):
I am not a word, I am not a line
I am not a girl that can ever be defined (If I can see it)

Blaine (New Directions Boys):
I hear the criticism loud and clear
That is how I know that the time is near (Then I can do it)
See we become alive in a time of fear
And I ain't got no motherfickle time to spare (If I just believe it)
Cry my eyes out for days upon days
Such a heavy burden placed upon me (There's nothing to it)

Blaine and Santana:
But when you go hard your nays become yays
Yankee Stadium with Jay's and Kanye's

Rachel and Santana (Rachel):
(I came to win), to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise

Finn with New Directions Boys (Rachel and New Directions Girls):

I believe I can touch the sky (Mercedes: Ooh-ooh, uh, yeah)
I believe I can fly (Fly)
I believe I can touch the sky (Mercedes: Fly)

Finn (Mercedes):
I believe I can fly (Fly)

Artie (Rachel with New Directions Girls):
(Get ready for it, get ready for it) Then I can be it
(Get ready for it, I came to win) If I just believe it
(Get ready for it, get ready for it) There's nothing to it

Mercedes with New Directions Girls:
Get ready for it

Artie and New Directions Boys (Rachel and New Directions Girls):
I believe I can fly (Fly) (Mercedes: Ooh-ooh)

Finn and New Directions Boys (Rachel and New Directions Girls):
I believe I can touch the sky (Mercedes: Fly)
I think about it every night and day (Fly) (Mercedes: Oh)
Spread my wings and fly away (Mercedes: Ooh, whoa)

Artie with New Directions Boys (Rachel and New Directions Girls):

You know the bed feels warmer
Sleeping here alone
You know I dream in color
And do the things I want

Brittany:
You think you got the best of me
Think you had the last laugh
Bet you think that everything good is gone
Think you left me broken down
Think that I'd come running back
Baby you don't know me 'cause you're dead wrong

The Troubletones:
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

You heard that I was starting over with someone new
They told you I was moving on, over you

I'd come back swinging

377,377,I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me),"[Intro]
I want to dance

[Verse 1]
Clocks strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done alright up 'til now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls
Loneliness calls

[Chorus]
Oh! I want to dance with somebody
I want to feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I want to dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh! I want to dance with somebody
I want to feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I want to dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

[Verse 2]
I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

[Chorus]
Oh! I want to dance with somebody
I want to feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I want to dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh! I want to dance with somebody
I want to feel the heat
Yeah! I want to dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

[Bridge]
Somebody who, somebody who
Somebody who loves me
Somebody who, somebody who
To hold me in his arms
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

[Chorus]
Oh! I want to dance with somebody
I want to feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I want to dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh! I want to dance with somebody
I want to feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I want to dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

378,378,Greatest Love Of All,"[Verse 1]
I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be
Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me

[Pre-Chorus]
I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

[Chorus]
Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all

[Verse 2]

380,380,Just A Kiss,"[Verse 1]
Lyin' here with you so close to me
It's hard to fight these feelings when it feels so hard to breathe
I'm caught up in this moment
I'm caught up in your smile

[Verse 2]
I've never opened up to anyone
So hard to hold back when I'm holding you in my arms
But we don't need to rush this
Let's just take it slow

[Chorus]
Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch in the fire burning so bright
No, I don't wanna mess this thing up
No, I don't wanna push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
So baby, I'm alright, with just a kiss goodnight

[Verse 3]
I know that if we give this a little time
It'll only bring us closer to the love we wanna find
It's never felt so real, no, it's never felt so right

[Chorus]
Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch in the fire burning so bright
No, I don't wanna mess this thing up
No, I don't wanna push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
So baby, I'm alright, with just a kiss goodnight

[Bridge]
No, I don't wanna say goodnight
I know it's time to leave
But you'll be in my dreams
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch in the fire burning so bright
No, I don't wanna mess this thing up
No, I don't wanna push too far

Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
So baby, I'm alright, oh

Well, looky here, looky here
Ah, what do we have?
Another pretty thing ready for me to grab
But little does she know that I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing
'Cause at the end of the night, it is her I'll be holding

[Pre-Chorus]
I love you so
That's what you'll say
You'll tell me, ""Baby, baby, please don't go away...""
But when I play, I never stay
So every girl that I meet, yeah, this is what I say

Run, run, run away, run away, baby
Before I put my spell on you
You better get, get, get away, get away, darlin'
'Cause everything you heard is true
Your poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause Lord knows I'm a rollin' stone
So you better run, run, run away, run away, baby

[Verse 2]
Well, let me think, let me think
Ah, what should I do?
So many eager young bunnies that I'd like to pursue
Now even though they eating out the palm of my hand
There's only one carrot and they all gotta share it

We're on an open bed truck on the highway
Rain is coming down and we're on the run
Think I can feel the breath in your body
We got to keep on running 'til we see the sun

You got a fire and it's burning in the rain
Thought that it went out but it's burning just the same
And you don't look back, not for anything
'Cause if you love someone, you love them all the same
If you love someone, you love them all the same

I feel your heartbeat
You're coming around, coming around, coming around
If you can love somebody, you love them all the same
You got to love somebody, you love them all the same

I'm trying to put it all back together
I got a story and I'm trying to tell it right
I got the kerosene and the desire
I'm trying to start a flame in the heart of the night

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you got a fire and it's burnin' in the rain
Thought that it went out, but it's burnin' just the same
And you don't look back, not for anything

I want to kiss your scars tonight
You got to try, you got to let me in
Let me in

She dropped the phone and burst into tears
The doctor just confirmed her fears
Her husband held it in and held her tight
Cancer don’t discriminate or care if you’re just 38
With three kids who need you in their lives
He said, ""I know that you’re afraid and I am, too
But you’ll never be alone, I promise you""

[Chorus]
When you’re weak, I’ll be strong
When you let go, I’ll hold on
When you need to cry, I swear that I’ll be there to dry your eyes
When you feel lost and scared to death
Like you can’t take one more step
Just take my hand, together we can do it
I'm going to love you through it

[Verse 2]
She made it through the surgery fine
They said they caught it just in time
But they had to take more than they planned
Now it's forced smiles and baggy shirts
To hide what the cancer took from her
But she just wants to feel like a woman again
She said, ""I don't think I can do this anymore""
He took her in his arms and said ""That's what my love is for""

[Chorus]
When you’re weak, I’ll be strong
When you let go, I’ll hold on
When you need to cry, I swear that I’ll be there to dry your eyes

Remix!
(One two, one two)
This the I'ma Boss Remix
Meek Milly
Let's go!

[Verse 1: T.I.]
I'm ride or die as I'm ridin’ by, holla Westside right inside of my
Bimmer 760i, try me let off sixty shots
Again we got the city hot and popping like it ‘posed to be
Hoes who not ménaging got no business standing close to me
So cold, a ferocious G, niggas ain't as dope as me
Mind your fuckin’ business, watch your mouth when you approachin' me
I fuck with hoes who fuck with hoes, do pills and powder socially
I like 'em, I don't love ‘em though, cold heart emotionally
Captain where the ocean is, riding in the Ghost again
Slap you with a lot of spit until she swallow all of it
Call the shots, run the shit, on some big money shit
Serious 'bout my hustle all these cowards on that funny shit
Rapping 'bout a bunch of shit and you ain't even done it yet
You the one they gunning at, how I'm ‘posed to honor that?
You all talk dawg, flaw and I ain't having none of that
I'm big boss dawg, floss all day and run it back

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Bitch, I'm a boss
Bitch, I'm a boss! Bitch, I'm a boss!
I play the shots, I call the calls
We in this bitch, it’s going down
Yeah, I'm the king, now where my muhfucking crown?

[Bridge: Swiss Beatz]
You a boss, she a boss, you don’t care what it cost
You just buy that motherfucker and you throw that shit on
You be popping them tags, we just throw it in bags
And then we hit the fucking block, we be droppin' them rags

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Started with a dollar, turn it to a M
Used to ride Impala, turn it to a Benz
Niggas used hate me, turn into my friends
You should see how people treat you when that money coming in
Bad bitches calling cause I'm balling
And these niggas hatin’ on me cause they starving
And I'm parking Aston Martins where they walking, these niggas ain't important
They informants really talking when the people get to honking
I'm a boss really, Nino or Al Pacino
Hundred racks on this Rollie, it light up like a casino
Niggas really be fraud, I’ma keep it a C-note
Got shooters down in Miami, they throw it like Dan Marino

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Had a couple seizures, call 'em minor setbacks
Everybody praying for me, I respect that
Woke up in the hospital, where my checks at
Then I put eight chains, where my neck's at
Hopping in the Ghost, I feel I'm dead set
Worth 40 M's so respect that
I put all my jewels on just to bone your chick
You know the boss well known for leavin' bonuses
We making money, may it marinate
When the work clean, cut it like it’s carrot cake
D-boys love the way I narrate
I still whip it like it's Anna Mae
Remember Momma had a Cavalier
Now she living like a Cleveland Cavalier
Better check the stats, we fillin' arenas
And I got the gats, Gilbert Arenas

[Hook]
Bitch, I'm a boss
Bitch, I'm a boss! Bitch, I'm a boss!
I play the shots, I call the calls
We in this bitch, it’s going down
Yeah, I'm the king, now where my muhfucking crown?

[Bridge 2: Swizz Beats]
You a boss, you a boss
Seven five, seven showers on her
Spend about thirteen hours on it
7-57 with the showers on it
We spent about thirteen hours on it

[Verse 4: Lil' Wayne]
Look, I be probably on my skateboard, tryna learn a new trick
I just fucked an Avatar, now I got a blue dick
Money talks, bullshit walks if the shoe fit
You pushing up daisies, daffodils, tulips
I'm in my zone, I'm Angie Stoned
I point the pistol at you like a camera phone
I'm Young Money, Cash Money, I'm not human
I’m tryna get money, money like Mark Cuban
If she don’t respect me, she gon' respect this dick
The world is an asshole and we the next big shit
Damn right I gang bang, tell 'em blood up slime
Fuck! I had to say fuck one time, get it

[Verse 5: Birdman]
When I came up in this bitch I was shining every summer
Took the whole thing, the young nigga doing numbers
Tote two nines, bitch, iced out stunting
Candy on the Ave, candy on the slab
Hundred Gs nigga, Cash Money millionaires
Hundred mil nigga, how we flipped it off the ave
Blood rich gang, you know we filthy nigga
The money do swang, behind a killer nigga
Catch me uptown putting it down
Moving all around, new fleets with my round
Touch another town, putting it all down
Pop a hundred bottles bitch, we wear the crown

[Hook]

385,385,Stupid Hoe,"[Intro]
Uh, yaow, yaow

[Verse 1]
I get it cracking like a bad back
Bitch talking she the queen when she looking like a lab rat
I'm Angelina, you Jennifer
C'mon, bitch, you see, where Brad at?
Ice my wrist-es then I piss on bitches
You could suck my diznick, if you take these jizzes
You don't like them disses, give my ass some kisses
Yeah, they know what this is, give bitches the business

[Verse 2]
'Cause I pull up and I'm stuntin' but I ain't a stuntman
Yes, I'm rockin' Jordans, but I ain't a jumpman
Bitches play the back 'cause they know I'm the frontman
Put me on a dollar 'cause I'm who they trust in
Ayo SB, what the fuck's good?
We ship platinum, them bitches is shippin' wood
Them nappy headed hoes, but my kitchen good
I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish a bitch would

[Chorus]
You a stupid ho, you a, you a stupid ho
You a stupid ho, you a, you a stupid ho

You a stupid ho, you a, you a stupid ho (You stupid, stupid)
You a stupid ho (You stupid, stupid)
Yeah, you a, you a stupid ho (You stupid, stupid)

[Verse 3]
Uh, look Bubbles, go back to ya' habitat
MJ gone, and I ain't havin' that
How you gonna be the stunt double to the nigga monkey?
Top of that I'm in the Phantom lookin' hella chonky
Ice my wrist-es then I piss on bitches
You could suck my diznick, if you take these jizzes
You don't like them disses, give my ass some kisses
Yeah, they know what this is, give bitches the business

[Verse 4]
'Cause I pull up in the Porsche, but it ain't de Rossi
Pretty bitches only could get in my posse
Yes, my name is Roman, last name is Zolanski
But no relation to Roman Polanski
Hey, yo Baby Bop, fuck you and your EP
Who's gassin' this ho? BP?
Hmm... thinks
One, two, three, do the Nicki Minaj blink
These hoes so busted, hoes is so crusty
These bitches is my sons and I don't want custody
These hoes so busted, hoes is so crusty
These bitches is my sons and I don't want custody

[Chorus]
You a stupid ho, you a, you a stupid ho
You a stupid ho, you a, you a stupid ho
You a stupid ho, you a, you a stupid ho
You a stupid ho
Yeah, you a, you a stupid ho
You a stupid ho, you a, you a stupid ho (You stupid, stupid)
You a stupid ho, you a, you a stupid ho (You stupid, stupid)
You a stupid ho, you a, you a stupid ho (You stupid, stupid)
You a stupid ho (You stupid, stupid)
Yeah, you a, you a stupid ho (You stupid, stupid)

[Verse 5]
If you cute, then your crew can roll
If you sexy, eat my cucka roll
Put ya' cape on, you a super ho
2012, I'm at the Super Bowl

[Bridge]
Stupid hoes is my enemy, stupid hoes is so wack
Stupid ho shoulda befriended me then she coulda prolly came back
Stupid hoes is my enemy, stupid hoes is so wack
Stupid ho shoulda befriended me then she could've probably came back
You a stupid ho, you a stupid ho, you a stupid ho
And I ain't hit that note, but fuck you stupid ho, fuck you stupid ho
I said fuck a stupid ho and fuck a stupid ho
I said fuck a stupid ho and fuck a stupid ho
I said fuck a stupid ho and fuck a stupid ho

386,386,No Church In The Wild,"[Produced By 88 Keys, Kanye West & Mike Dean]

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the Colosseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rolling in the Rolls Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, I’m hiding from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic
I’m wondering if a thug’s prayers reach
Is Pious pious 'cause God loves pious?
Socrates asked, whose bias do y'all seek?
All for Plato, screech
I’m out here balling, I know y'all hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats
Preach

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild

[Bridge: The-Dream]
I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
Let me in through your encryption
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Coke on her black skin made it stripe like a zebra
I call that jungle fever
You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there’s permission
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody without telling me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad real
Sun coming up, 5 a.m
I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinking 'bout the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tattoos: one read ""No Apologies""
The other said ""Love is Cursed by Monogamy""
It’s something that the pastor don’t preach
It’s something that a teacher can’t teach
When we die, the money we can’t keep
But we probably spend it all 'cause the pain ain’t cheap
Preach

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild

[Outro: Frank Ocean]

Ripping my heart was so easy, so easy
Launch your assault, now, take it easy
Raise your weapon, raise your weapon
One word and it's over

Ripping through like a missile, ripping through my heart
Rob me of this love
Raise your weapon, raise your weapon

Love your ego, you won't feel a thing
Always number one, the pen with a bent wrist, crooked king

How does it feel now to watch it burn, burn, burn?
Raise your weapons, raise your weapons

Think that they know you more than you do
So you take it down, another pill to swallow

Well ya, ya like to bring me down, don't ya?
But I ain't laying down, baby, I ain't goin' down
Can't nobody tell me how it's gonna be
Nobody gonna make a fool outta me, baby

But I ain't falling back again

Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleeping
And I was hoping you would creep in

It's 5 o'clock in the morning, and I want ya
And you want me, don't ya?
I can see it cause you've been waiting on me
Since I said that I was hitting in the club
Sun be coming up on me
And I know you be getting so horny
Cause you be sending me textses
Like, ""Boy just get your ass up in that car
And come get all of this love""
(It's 5 o'clock in the morning) You ain't got to remind me
She already said if I don't come on time
She might go crazy
And she'll be waiting on me naked with one of my chains on
She might come and find me (aw, aw, aw)
And then ask me kindly (aw, aw, aw)
Do I want her to go crazy? We do this every night
And yet we wake up singing the same song

And I pretended I was sleeping
And I was hoping you would creep in

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
It's 5 o'clock in the morning, and you calling
And these females got me stalling
I can hear your voice in my head like
""What is he doing? What is he doing?""
Cause I keep checking my cell phone
And these missed calls
And you texting me like, ""I'mma kill y'all
If you don't get your ass up out of that club
And do you know what time it is?""
(It's 5 o'clock in the morning) Ooh, and my bad, girl
And this Nuvo got me trippin and I know that you mad, girl
But you ain't got to worry about nothing (worry 'bout nothing)
Girl I got you, girl I got you
She might come and find me (no, no, no)
And then ask me kindly (no, no, no)
Do I want her to go crazy? We do this every night
And then we always wake up singing the same song

[Hook: Lily Allen & (T-Pain)]
It's 5 o' clock in the morning (Yeah)
Conversation got boring (Talk to me, girl)
You said you'd go into bed soon (Let's go)
So I snuck off to your bedroom (Come on)
And I thought I'd just wait there (Wait on me)
Until I heard you come up the stairs
(I won't let you stay lonely)
And I pretended I was sleeping (All right)
And I was hoping you would creep in (All right)
It's 5 o' clock in the morning
The conversation got boring
You said you'd go into bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleeping
And I was hoping you would creep in

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Oh-oh, and you ain't got nothing on
But the t-shirt that I left over your house
The last time I came and put it on ya
Too many thirsty girls up in this club
For me to leave here with one of them, that's why I call her
And you'll be right at home waiting for me
IPhone plugged in the wall, just waiting for me
Club closed at 6, left around 4:30
Yeah, so by the time I'm at your crib
(It’s 5′O Clock in the morning) And you yawning
But I’ve been drinking all night and I feel like performing
With you in the bedroom, floor to the dresser
Dont want nothing less cause I’m sure you’re the best
You’re the one, so I let you, thats how you show me love
And when we finish you like “damn, babe you woke me up”
I like you way you put it down likes its for both of us
The sun ain't the only thing thats coming up

392,392,Strange Clouds,"[Intro: B.o.B]
Yeah, haha
Oh you already know what we gon' do
Hey

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Well if you guessin' it's me, you guessed correctly
I just stay with a stallion, you would swear I was an equestrian
And um, I'ma hit her with that pipe, call that Nancy Kerrigan
Stay on the greenest greens, call us vegetarians
You be on that minor league, but we smoke professionally
I do my job exceptionally, on point like a decimal is
The way I ride on the beat man
I beat every street, it's done so effortlessly
Yeah, so these niggas can't sleep on me, there's no Inception in this
Bitch, I'm top chef, you Top Ramen, I'm top shelf
No last call, to the bartender; ""what you got left?""
Pour it up, don't stop there, hold your cup, take a shot, yeah
All night we celebrate, cause we everywhere and you not there

[Hook: B.o.B]
All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out
(That's all we do, that's all we do)
And all we do is light it up, all night
All you see is strange clouds
(Strange clouds, strange clouds)
All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out
(That's all we do, that's all we do)
And all we do is light it up, all night
All you see is strange clouds
(Strange clouds, strange clouds)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh, blue jeans, I'm faded, mining my own data
Smokin' on that strong, that Arnold Schwarzenegger
It’s Tunechi Li, you bitch you
You hot as a igloo
Kick back on that Glock, call that Jiu Jitsu
Hello world, I’m with a yellow girl, number two pencil
These rappers is washed up, spin cycle, rinse you
My nigga, all day, all night, half-pipe
I dive in that pussy, ya I belly flop, I jack knife
And shit, tell my homies that I say it’s a party
Yeah, got that TEC for technical difficulties
I’m top dog, you top ramen, I’m top dog
Piru, gangsters, outlaws!

[Hook: B.o.B & Lil Wayne]
All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out (Yeaaaaaah!)
(That's all we do, that's all we do) (Young Mula, baby!)
And all we do is light it up, all night
All you see is strange clouds
(Strange clouds, strange clouds)
All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out (B.o.B. fuck with me!)
(That's all we do, that's all we do)
And all we do is light it up, all night
All you see is strange clouds
(Strange clouds, strange clouds)

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
Well ain't no question, yes, it's B.o.B, yes definitely
Up in the studio, I got all my necessities
Look, if you want that real shit, you made the right selection
I'm Decatur 'til I die, yes I rep that definitely
They say I'm a celebrity, what the fuck's a celebrity?
I guess I must invest in the proper form of protection
And I say it's a curse, but it's been mostly a blessin'
To a nigga from the hood
Tryin' to aim for the top, I didn't even need no directions
I just wake up then I roll up the purp
But these niggas wake up on my dick, at least have some breakfast first
Nigga keep your nourishment first, and your mind on my lyrics
Cause what you hopin' to accomplish, I already did it
Bitch!

[Hook: B.o.B]
All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out
(That's all we do, that's all we do)
And all we do is light it up, all night
All you see is strange clouds
(Strange clouds, strange clouds)
All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out
(That's all we do, that's all we do)
And all we do is light it up, all night
All you see is strange clouds

Bounce that ass, shake that ass like the Twerk Team
Hair long, ass fat, shawty mean
That girl look like Halle Berry when I'm on them beans
When I hit the scene girls yelling and they scream
""Flocka can you be my baby daddy?"" (Yes!)
Pimping like I'm Dolemite, hoes jump in my Caddy
Smoke like I got cataract in the strip club throwing up them stacks
Got racks on top of racks
Bust that pussy, make that ass clap, clap, clap
I ain't done with you, baby bring that ass back
Still got 20's, still got 50's, even got them hundreds

Cool, take it low, take it way lower than that
I fly private when I go, ain't no layover on that
Yeah I made it to the top, took a seat, still sitting man
I'm up in Stadium in D.C. still tipping man
She coulda paid tuition five times, still stripping
I just throw a couple bills, and she'll have a pair of heels
Oh no, there I go, magic tricking on your ass
Throwing every president except for Nixon on your ass
Make you rich, I feel like I should make commission on your ass
Wonder what you would ever do if I went missing on your ass

Drop it down for me girl do a split, do you smoke girl? Gotta zip
White Rémy Martin, who wanna sip? 45 on my hip
But I gain one deep and every word I say is slurrin'
Vision, man is blurrin', drunk too much liquor
Smoke too much weed, bitch I'm on too much E

In love with strip clubs, shorty I'm a big tipper
Two hundred then I pull down my zipper, ughh
Shawty say she want me and she wanna meet my crew, Squad
Niggas know we go hard, Squad

[Alt. Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
Bounce that ass, shake that ass like the Twerk Team

¿Cómo puede ser verdad?
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

David and Santana:
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature, wild and free
This is where I long to be
La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

Santana:
I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

This is where I long to be

Santana:
Yo quiero estar donde el sol toca cielo
Cuando es hora de siesta tú los puedes ver pasar

396,396,Brighter Than The Sun,"[Verse 1]
Stop me on the corner
Swear you hit me like a vision
I, I, I wasn't expecting
But who am I to tell fate where it's supposed to go?
With it
Don't you blink; you might miss it
See, we got a right to just love it or leave it
You find it and keep it
'Cause it ain't every day you get the chance to say...

[Chorus]
Oh, this is how it starts, lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, we could be the stars, falling from the sky
Shining how we want, brighter than the sun

[Verse 2]
I'd never seen it
But I found this love, I'm gonna feed it
You better believe
I'm gonna treat it better than anything I've ever had
'Cause you're so damn beautiful
Read it, it's signed and delivered, let's seal it
Boy, we go together like peanuts and Paydays
Marley and reggae
And everybody needs to get a chance to say...

[Chorus]
Oh, this is how it starts, lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, we could be the stars, falling from the sky
Shining how we want, brighter than the sun

[Bridge]
Everything is like a white out
'Cause we shika-shika shine down
Even when the, when the light's out, but I can see you glow
Got my head up in the rafters, got me happy ever after
Never felt this way before, ain't felt this way before

I swear you hit me like a vision
I, I, I wasn't expecting
But who am I to tell fate where it's supposed to go?

[Chorus]
Oh, this is how it starts (This is how it starts)
Lightning strikes the heart (Lightning strikes the heart)
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, we could be the stars, falling from the sky (Falling from the sky)
Shining how we want, brighter than the sun
Oh, this is how it starts (This is how it starts)
Lightning strikes the heart (Lightning strikes the heart)
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, we could be the stars, falling from the sky
Shining how we want (Shining how we want)
Brighter than the sun

[Bridge]
Brighter than the sun
Brighter than the sun
Brighter than the sun
Oh-o, yeah, oh-o

[Outro]
Oh, this is how it starts, lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, this is how it starts, lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, this is how it starts, lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, this is how it starts, lightning strikes the heart

Não estou trabalhando duro?
É, certo, fotografe isso com uma Kodak
E melhor ainda, vá à Times Square
Tire uma foto minha com uma Kodak
Tire a minha vida do negativo ao positivo
E eu só quero que todos vocês saibam
Que à noite, vamos curtir a vida
Pitbull, Nayer, Ne-Yo!

À noite eu quero tudo de você, à noite
Me dê tudo à noite
Para todos sabermos que podemos não alcançar o amanhã
Vamos fazer isso à noite

(Não se importe com o que eles dizem
Todos os jogos que eles jogam
Nada é suficiente
Até que eles mexam com o amor)
Vamos fazer isso à noite
(Eu quero você à noite
Eu quero que você fique
Eu quero você à noite)

Pegue alguém sexy e diga-a
Me dê tudo à noite
Me dê tudo à noite
Me dê tudo à noite
Me dê tudo à noite

Ocupe-se à noite
Porque cada vez mais faço o mal antes a Prius
Desesperado à noite
Posso te fazer minha rainha
E fazer amor com você infinitamente
Isso é insano, a maneira como o nome cresce, o dinheiro se mantém fluindo
Os trabalhadores se movem para o lado, então estou na ponta dos pés, mantenha fluindo
Fiquei trancado como a Lindsay Lohan
Coloque isso na minha vida, querida
Posso fazer te sentir bem, querida
Não posso prometer o amanhã
Mas prometo a noite
Dale

Me perdoe
Mas eu posso beber um pouco mais do que deveria, à noite
E eu posso te levar pra casa comigo se eu puder, à noite
E querida, eu posso te fazer sentir tão bem à noite
Porque nós podemos não alcançar o amanhã

À noite eu quero tudo de você, à noite
Me dê tudo à noite
Para todos sabermos que podemos não alcançar o amanhã
Vamos fazer isso à noite

(Não se importe com o que eles dizem
Todos os jogos que eles jogam
Nada é suficiente
Até que eles mexam com o amor)
Vamos fazer isso à noite
(Eu quero você à noite
Eu quero que você fique
Eu quero você à noite)

Pegue alguém sexy e diga-o
Me dê tudo à noite
Me dê tudo à noite
Me dê tudo à noite
Me dê tudo à noite

Alcance as estrelas
E se você pegá-las, pelo menos você está no topo do mundo
Pense nisso
Porque se você escorregar, eu irei cair em cima de você, garota
Coloque bolas quando eles dormirem no Macy's
E não há segredo
Minha avó é de Cuba, mas sou americano
Amarrado sobre o dinheiro, como Seacrest
Coloque isso na minha vida, querida
Posso fazer você se sentir bem, querida
Não posso prometer o amanhã
Mas prometo a noite
Dale

Me perdoe
Mas eu talvez beba um pouco mais do que deveria, à noite
E eu posso te levar pra casa comigo se eu puder, à noite
E querida, eu posso te fazer sentir tão bem à noite
Porque nós podemos não alcançar o amanhã

À noite eu quero tudo de você, à noite
Me dê tudo à noite

Early monday morning to friday at five
Man I work work work but I don't climb climb climb
Boss man can shove that over time up his can
All I wanna do is put a drink in my hand

[Chorus 1]
To fill it up or throw it down
I got a forty hour week worth of trouble to drown
No need to complicate it, I'm a simple man
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand

[Verse 2]
Yeah the parking lot is muddy, can't get to the door
I take my jacked up drop er down in 4x4
She'll down a long neck, warm up the band
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand

[Chorus 2]
To fill it up or throw it down
I'm about to tear a new one in this old town
5 4 3 2 1 I'll be your rocket man
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand

[Verse 3]
You make me want to go ouuh ouhhh when you dance like that
You got that little tattoo playing peaky boo on your back
If you want to impress me baby here's my plan
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand

[Chorus 3]
To fill it up or throw it down
When you drive me home take the long way around
You be my Lois Lane I'll be your Superman
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand

[Verse 4]
My head monday morning as that alarm clock sings
It goes bang bang bang while it ring ring rings
Yeah I'm ready to roll if you wanna rock again
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand

Yeah I'm ready to roll
If you want to rock again
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand

Damn right I'm ready to roll
If you want to rock again
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand

Yeah I'm ready to roll
If you want to rock again
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand

[Chorus 4]
To fill it up or throw it down
I got a little hangover still hanging around
Yeah that hair of a dog is saying hey there man
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand

[Outro]
Yea that hair of a dog is howling hey there man
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand

The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear his voice
Shake my window

Willy survive, never deceased

I'ma kill the game, leave the rest in pieces
Now everybody want my recipes
Tell a jealous chicken
I don't know what the beef is

I'ma work hard, that's my thesis

I'ma go hard, like a motherfuckin' boner
I'ma make the beat put the people in a coma
You can be a geek or be a rolling stoner (Uh)
I woke up in the morning
Hard like morning wood in the morning
Woke up thinking about microphoning
E.T. own the mic, phone the homeland (Uh)

404,404,Tattoos On This Town,"[Verse 1]
There's still black marks on that county road
Where we drag raced our pick-ups and Mustangs
And weathered all the sun and rain
And to this day up on that overpass
Even underneath the new paint, you can still see
""Allie, will you marry me?""

[Interlude]
Take a ride, look around
There ain't no doubt

[Chorus]
It sure left its mark on us, we sure left our mark on it
We let the world know we were here with everything we did
We laid a lot of memories down, like tattoos on this town

[Verse 2]
There's still a rope burn on that old branch, that hangs over the river
I still got the scar
From swinging out a little too far
There ain't a corner of this hallow ground
That we don't laughed or cried on
It's where we loved, lived and learned real life stuff
It's everything we're made of

[Chorus]
It sure left its mark on us, we sure left our mark on it
We let the world know we were here with everything we did
We laid a lot of memories down, like tattoos on this town
Like tattoos on this town

Everywhere, there we are
It hits me right in my heart

[Verse 3]

405,405,Bait A Hook,"[Verse 1]
I heard you had to drive him home after two umbrella drinks
I heard he's got a Prius, because he's into being green
My buddies said he saw y'all, eating that sushi stuff
Baby that don't sound like you, that don't sound like love
Sounds like it sucks

[Chorus]
He can't even bait a hook
He can't even skin a buck
He don't know who Jack Daniels is
He ain't ever drove a truck
Knows how to throw out a line
But not the kind in a field and stream book
No darling I ain't even worried, you'll come running back
He can't even bait a hook

[Verse 2]
Has he kissed you in a hay field as the summer rain falls down?
Has he took you to meet his mama, back in his home town?
Does he drive the interstate, or does he take them old back roads?
Can he melt your heart with a country song, every good old boy should know?
I didn't think so

[Chorus]
He can't even bait a hook
He can't even skin a buck
He don't know who Jack Daniels is
He ain't ever drove a truck
Knows how to throw out a line
But not the kind in a field and stream book
No darling I ain't even worried, you'll come running back
He can't even bait a hook

[Bridge]
It won't be that long, until you start getting bored
I'll be smiling on the river, reeling in one more

[Chorus]
He can't even bait a hook
He can't even skin a buck
He don't know who Jack Daniels is
He ain't ever drove a truck
Knows how to throw out a line
But not the kind in a field and stream book
No darling I ain't even worried, you'll come running back
He can't even bait a hook

406,406,Storm Warning,"[Verse 1]
She rolled in from the west in a summer sun dress
Hotter than the heat in July
With her wind-blown hair; it just wasn't fair
The way she was blowin' my mind
Have you ever noticed every hurricane
Gets its name from a girl like this?
She's a cat five kind, keeps you up at night
Hangin' on to the edge of a kiss

[Pre-Chorus 1]
She's a beautiful mess
Yeah, the kind you love to love
But what happens next?
I got a feelin' when the sun comes up

[Chorus]
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
I'm gonna wish I had a little heads up
A little leeway, a little more time
Some kind of radar system locked in on love
I got a feelin' by the time the night finds the mornin'
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning

[Verse 2]
Ain't it funny how it feels when you're burning your wheels
Somewhere between going and gone?
You get so lost that you can't turn it off
You give in and you just turn it on
She's a heart full of rain, red lips like a flame
She's a girl from your favorite song

[Pre-Chorus 2]
What a beautiful mess
One part angel, one part perfect, one part a wreck
The kind of flood you'll never forget

[Chorus]
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
I'm gonna wish I had a little heads up
A little leeway, a little more time
Some kind of radar system locked in on love
I got a feelin' by the time the night finds the mornin'
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning

[Bridge]
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
I'm gonna wish I had a little heads up

I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
I'm gonna wish I had a little heads up
A little leeway, a little more time
Some kind of radar system locked in on love
I got a feelin' by the time the night finds the mornin'
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
Yeah, I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
I'm gonna wish I had a sign, gonna wish I had a sign
Of a storm warning yeah

[Outro]
A little heads up, little more time
Little leeway some kind of sign (Some kind of sign)
Oh, would've been nice
Some kind of radar system
If I heard it, yeah, I would've listened

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I may be young, but I'm ready
To give you all my love
I told my girls you can get it
Don't slow it down, just let it go

[Pre-Chorus 1: Beyoncé]
So in love, I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
So tonight, I'll do it every way
Speakers knocking 'til the morning light

Hey! hey! hey! hey! hey!
'Cause we like to party, hey!
Hey! hey! hey! hey! hey!

Top down, with the radio on and the night belongs to us
Just hold me close, don't let me go

[Pre-Chorus 2: Beyoncé]
So in love, I don't care what they say
I don't care if they're talking tomorrow

Fuck with me, baby, I’ll make it milk till it drip down your knees
Spit this shit for reallo, Brain Brillo
Kiddo say he looks up to me, this just makes me feel old
Never thought that we could become someone else's hero
Man, we were just in the food court eating our gyros
Yesterday, that's the way, every single morning I try to pray
Grandmom and them they never forgot and nothing else really mean nothing to me
I ain't studying the beat
You talking to me? Girl, why you fucking with me?
Move on there ain't nothing to see
Pshh, always something to saw
I'm the raw, off the rip, cause of him
All of them, will remem-ber the min-

Blue like when that rent is due, cream like when I'm loving you, yeah

[Verse 1]
I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin' the consequence
Drinkin' every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floatin' in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt ‘cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it (Ayy), please don't do it (Ayy)
‘Cause one of us goes in, and we all go through it (Ayy)
And Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gonna pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know

[Chorus]
They know, they know, they know (They know, ayy)
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know

[Verse 2]
Yeah!
I be yellin' out, ""Money over everything! Money on my mind!""
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says, ""They miss the old Drake"", girl don't tempt me
""If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do""
I'm like, ""Why I gotta be all that?""
But still I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listening to you expressin' all them feelings
Soap opera rappers, all these niggas sound like All My Children
And that's who you thinkin' is 'bout to come and make a killin'
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
‘Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it
I ain't even gotta say it, they know

[Chorus]
They know, they know, they know (They know)
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know

[Outro]
I be yelling out ""Money over everything!""
""Money on my mind, mind, mind-mind!""
Tell them I apologize, it happened over time, time, time-time
They know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah…

[Skit]
I heard once that they would rather hear about memories than enemies
Rather hear what was or will be than what is
Rather hear how you got it over, how much it cost you
Rather hear about findin' yourself than how you lost you
Rather you make this an open letter

Girl I've been all over the world
Looking for you
I'm known for taking what I think I deserve
And you're overdue
And if you listen you can hear me through the radio
In that bright white noise
What I been missing in my life
That I been dreaming of
You'll be that girl
You'll be that girl
You'll be

Get a little closer to me girl
And you'll understand
Cause if you want a guy that knows what you need
Well, then I'm your man

Robert's got a quick hand
He'll look around the room, he won't tell you his plan
He's got a rolled cigarette
Hanging out his mouth, he's a cowboy kid
Yeah, he found a six-shooter gun
In his dad's closet, oh in a box of fun things
I don't even know what
But he's coming for you, yeah, he's coming for you

Daddy works a long day
He be coming home late, and he's coming home late
And he's bringing me a surprise
'Cause dinner's in the kitchen and it's packed in ice

Yeah, the sleight of my hand is now a quick-pull trigger
I reason with my cigarette
And say, ""Your hair's on fire, you must've lost your wits,"" yeah

It's hard to find the perfect time to say something
You know is gonna change everything
Living with the shame, it ain't nothing like the pain that I saw on her face
Now me and my pile of things
That she throw out the window
Drowning next to me
No seven years of good can't hide the one night I forgot to wear that ring

Still love the way he talk, still love the way I sing
Still love the way he rock them black diamonds in that chain
Still all up on each other, ain't a damn thing change
My girls can't tell me nothing, I'm gone in the brain
I'm all up under him like it's cold, winter time
All up in the kitchen in my heels, dinner time
Do whatever that it takes, he got a winner's mind
Give it all to him, meet him at the finish line

[Refrain]
Me and my boo in my boo's coupe riding
All up in that black with his chick right beside him
Ladies, if you love your man, show him you the fliest
Grind up on it, girl, show him how you ride it
Me and my boo in my boo's coupe riding
All up in that black with his chick right beside him
Ladies, if you love your man, show him you the fliest
Grind up on it, girl, show him how you ride it

[Chorus]
Oh, killing me softly and I'm still falling
Still the one I need, I will always be with you
Oh, you got me all gone, don't ever let me go
Say it real loud if you fly
If you leave me, you're out of your mind

[Hook]
My baby is a ten
We dressing to the nine
He pick me up, we eight
Make me feel so lucky, seven
He kiss me in his six
We be making love in five
Still the one I do this four
I'm trying to make us three
From that two
He still the one

[Verse 2]
Yup, I put it on him, it ain't nothing that I can't do
Yup, I buy my own, if he deserve it, buy his shit too
All up in the store, shorty, tricking if I want to
All up in the store, shorty, fly as we want to
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Damn, I think I love that boy, do anything for that boy (Boy)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Now I'll never be the same, you and me until the end

[Refrain]
Me and my boo in my boo's coupe riding
All up in that black with his chick right beside him
Ladies, if you love your man, show him you the fliest
Grind up on it, girl, show him how you ride it

[Refrain 2]
Me and my boo in the coupe lip locking
All up in the back because the chicks keep flocking
All that gossip in ten years, stop it
London speed it up, Houston rock it

[Chorus]
Oh, killing me softly and I'm still falling
Still the one I need, I will always be with you
Oh, you got me all gone, don't ever let me go
Say it real loud if you fly
If you leave me, you're out of your mind

413,413,Marry The Night,"[Verse 1]
I'm gonna marry the night
I won’t give up on my life
I'm a warrior queen
Live passionately tonight
I'm gonna marry the dark
Gonna make love to the stark
I'm a soldier to my own emptiness
I'm a winner
I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna marry the night

[Chorus 1]
I'm gonna marry the night
I'm not gonna cry anymore
I'm gonna marry the night
Leave nothing on these streets to explore

[Post-Chorus]
Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night
Oh, ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna lace up my boots
Throw on some leather and cruise
Down the streets that I love
In my fishnet gloves, I'm a sinner
Then I'll go down to the bar
But I won't cry anymore
I'll hold my whiskey up high
Kiss the bartender twice, I'm a loser
I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna marry the night

[Chorus 1]
I'm gonna marry the night
I'm not gonna cry anymore
I'm gonna marry the night
Leave nothing on these streets to explore

[Post-Chorus]
Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night
Oh, ma-ma-ma-marry

Ma-ma-ma-marry the night

[Bridge]
Nothing's too cool to take me from you
New York is not just a tan that you never lose
Love is the new denim or black
Skeleton guns are wedding bells in the attic
Get Ginger ready, climb to El Camino front
Won't poke holes in the seat with my heels
Cause that's where we make love
Come on run
Turn the car on and run

[Chorus 2]
I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna burn a hole in the road
I'm gonna marry the night
Leave nothing on these streets to explore

[Post-Chorus]
Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night

Kevin wasn't really all that popular in school
But I remember well the day I thought now that guy's pretty cool
He pulled into the parking lot and everybody cheered
Because he had gone and painted his entire Chevy Cavalier camouflage

[Chorus]
Camouflage it disappears when it pulls out of his garage
Camouflage-camouflage

[Verse 2]
I asked Jenny to the prom and her mom knew how to sew
So she made a matching tux and gown from Duck Blind Mossy Oak
We took pictures in the backyard before we went to the dance
And the only thing that you can see is our faces and our hands

[Chorus]
Camouflage
Camouflage you should've seen the way it popped with her corsage
Camouflage, camouflage, ain't nothing that doesn't go with camouflage

[Bridge]
You can blend in in the country
You can stand out in the fashion world
Be invisible to a white tail, irresistible to a redneck girl

[Chorus 2]
Camouflage, camouflage
Oh you're my favorite color camouflage

[Bridge]
You can blend in in the country
You can stand out in the fashion world
Be invisible to a white tail, irresistible to a redneck girl

[Verse 3]
Well the stars and bars offend some folks and I guess I see why
Nowadays there's still a way to show your southern pride
The only thing as patriotic is the old red white and blue
Is green and gray and black and brown and tan all over too

Camouflage, camouflage
Designed by Mother Nature and by God

Oh yeah
Watch it, oh!
Just shoot for the stars, if it feels right
And aim for my heart, if you feel like
And take me away and make it okay
I swear I'll behave

You wanted control, so we waited
I put on a show, now I make it
I was born in a crossfire hurricane
And I howled at my Ma in the drivin' rain
It goes like this

Take me by the tongue and I'll know you (But it's alright)
Kiss me till you're drunk and I'll show you (But it's alright now)
All the moves like Jagger, I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the jumping jack flash, it's a gas, gas, gas

I don't need to try to control you (But it's alright)
Look into my eyes and I'll own you (But it's alright now)
With them moves like Jagger, I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger

Maybe it's hard when you feel like
You're broken and scarred, nothing feels right
But when you're with me, I'll make you believe
That I've got the key

Oh, so get in the car, we can ride it
Wherever you want, get inside it
I was drowned, I was washed up and left for dead
I fell down to my feet and I saw they bled
Like this

Take me by the tongue and I'll know you (But it's alright)
Kiss me till you're drunk and I'll show you (But it's alright now)
All the moves like Jagger, I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the jumping jack flash, it's a gas, gas, gas

Summer heat, boy and girl meet
But uh-oh those summer nights

[NEW DIRECTIONS]
Woo, woo, woo!

Tell me more, tell me more

[SANTANA]
How much dough did he spend?

[NEW DIRECTIONS BOYS]
Tell me more, tell me more

[RORY]
Could she get me a friend?

[SAM]
It turned colder - that's where it ends

[MERCEDES]
So I told him we'd still be friends

[SAM]
Then we made our true love vow

[MERCEDES]
Wonder what he's doing now

[MERCEDES & SAM]
Summer dreams ripped at the seams
Bu-ut oh those summer nights...!

When I flex Elvis talks
I got hula girls on the back of my leg
And she hulas when I walk

Screaming electric green
Purple mountains' majesty
Really talk to me

Best to see these true colors than follow one of your false virtues

Cause we don't know how to back down
We were called out to the streets
We were called out to the towns
How the heavens they opened up
Like arms of dazzling gold
With our rain-washed histories
Well, we do not need to be told

Show me now, show me the arms aloft
Every eye, trained on a different star
This magic, this drunken semaphore, and I

This is your life, this your time
We are listening and were not blind
This is your life, this is your time

By a choir of beautiful cheats
And as the kids took back the parks
You and I were left with the streets

Whistling my name
Open up a beer and you say, ""Get over here""
And play a video game

Take that body downtown
I say, ""You da bestest,"" lean in for a big kiss
Put his favorite perfume on
""Go play your video game""

Tell me all the things you wanna do

They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you

Living for the fame
Kissing in the blue dark, playing pool and wild darts

Watching all our friends fall in and out of Old Paul's
This is my idea of fun

First day of practice I was thinking about this
Picture on the news, yeah they see about this
Even in the paper they gon' read about this
Cause all of my life
Training day and night
I’m preparing to fight
For everyone I believed in
I was going insane, they were screaming our name
While were spraying champagne
There’s nothing nobody can say

[Hook]
Cause today is the day
Is the day that I have always dreamed of forever
When you call me
You call me the champ of the world
I can raise my hands
I can scream I’m the best in the world
Whole world
All my blood, sweat and grind
Was all for this time

Lap after lap, mile after mile
Push up after push up
Everybody count it out
Everybody up, now we back down
All my pain and sweat was for this moment right now
All from different places well we came with each other
We came together as a team
But we’re leaving as brothers
Standing next to one another while we hold up our colors
I’m gon’ look in to the camera and tell my mama I love her

Class is elements of a classic, I've got evidence of a master
You never thought you'd be bodied by a bastard
A bachelor who backspin on breakbeats
Break necks of broke souls who hate me
Hate he? You can't take my heat
Fireball flow, can't bat in my league
I'm the best rapper that's been slept on
Stick around like gum that's been stepped on
Stepped on, I stepped up, so what up?
Tryna make bread with these damn cold cuts
I cold crush every beat that I touch
My words silk and my flow is pure plush
Tell HudMo Dope says, ""What's up?""

[Verse 3: Go Dreamer]
Go Dreamer's a looney (Uh)
Wish upon a star (So what's up?)
I'm too cold for Pluto so I'm movin' back to Mars
'Cause this that spaceship, that space shit
This that Category 5, this that quake, bitch, that quake, bitch
See I'm so funked out, like out of here
Like blue lights in the basement
And it's a red state, in Georgia with it
Last verse, did you get it? Nah
Never mind, just throw that cash in a duffle
As I'm on my Hollywood shuffle
Eatin' your million dollar truffles, this acquirin' taste, nigga
Tantalise so you can see the bigger picture that God is the light
In the fixture or in the background
Cut all the hatin' in the background
'Cause if music and money is the motive, then you're so gimmick
Who's to tell me I can't have a trillion dollar grilled cheese sandwich?
Boy stop playin', stop playin', I'm just sayin', just sayin'
Go, go, go, go-go (Uh), go, go, go, uh
Now who else wanna fuck with Hollyweird Go?

[Verse 4: RetcH]
Break up and roll it, light it and smoke it
Pass it, don't hold it, lovin' that potent
I'm drunk and I'm rollin', this pill got me open
These bad hoes is gruntin', their booties is pokin'
Out them little dresses, a nigga wanna fuck
He don't even smoke, but tell Butter roll a blunt
'Cause I'm way too drunk and I'm too turnt up
And I brought my own drugs and I do my own stunts
Young and I'm wildin', new drugs, I try 'em
He'll call me RetcH, but your bitch call me Brian
In Polo I'm stylin', it's all that I'm rockin'
If you catch me out in 'Lo it's a problem
'Less it's a Champion suit, then I'm trappin'
Fuck with me, I got all this 'Lo all from raggin' (What?)
Used to have a nigga that was down to get to clappin'
Seen it on a video, he yappin' to the captain
That nigga snitchin', R86 him
These niggas trannies 'cause these niggas switchin'
And these niggas bitchin' more than these bitches
And I'm just so sick of this shit, it's ridiculous
Middle finger to the feds and bitches all day
Take her out to eat then I make a bitch pay
And my wine on chill and my shrimps sautéed
And I'm chillin' in L.A. with a bitch for the day

[Verse 5: Nipsey Hussle]
Look, ain't that a bitch?
Foot up on the gas, ain't no brakes in this bitch
Cover girl givin' face to the Crip
Somethin' 'bout a nigga on the way to the chips
High off the money and I'm wasted as shit
High off the life and she can't get a grip
Hundred dollar cup and you can't get a sip
I'm a million dollar nigga, you should take you a flick
Hundred thousand dollar car where I sit
And my broad is the shit, Crenshaw in the 6
Got it parked at the Shell in front of all of the Crips
You either ball or you brick
She don't know money so she callin' you rich
You ain't got game so you fall for the shit
Spend it all in this bitch 'til it's gone and she split
Now you feel like a wimp
Talkin' 'bout what you was buildin' and shit
Got you all up in your feelings and shit
Problem is, she addicted to the real nigga shit
To the real nigga shit
50 dollar, hundred dollar bill nigga shit
Gold crown on a real nigga wrist
Fresh like my nephew Khalil in this bitch
.40 cal, no concealing the shit
Four gun cases, I'm still with this shit
Backlit, wood wheel when I whip
Got her right up on my lap, that's a real nigga risk
In the field on my tip
Hoes like Phil then I Stockton assist
It ain't no stoppin' the shit, so avoid the potholes, put stocks on the 6

[Verse 6: Problem]
Got Mary blowing Jane
We fucking high, sex on a plane
Hey newscaster, we about to rain
Get love in the club because we fill the section with pain, c'mon
Blow him up, finna explode
All of Hell's Kitchen praying he don't stick to the stove
God got me, illumi-not-me written in bold
Slept on, now I'm everywhere like g-g-g-go crazy
Buy 150, let me tell y'all now, I want Nikki
Lift her up like helicopter far away from her fellow
Let her play Problem
While problem tongue play with propeller (What)
Keep fresh just in Margielas
Diamond lane running thangs ain't shit you can tell us (Don't tell us nothing)
Done everything, ain't shit you can sell us
Money over bullshit, friction derail us (Naw!)
Compton niggas, yeah we take it or leave it
Know once it's almost over tryin' to jerk the wheel
You nervous, like them cutters he'd inject the speed
And you think you mothafucka faking me, my nigga? (What)
Yeah I bet a nigga crawl to the crown
I'm a boss, hire hoes while I bottle out
I see them niggas shaking hands and biting styles
Got her to stay city in 'cause I fired her spouse
'Cause I'm a mad man
Just fuck niggas like the Klan, man
Put you to sleep like the Sandman
Give me the throne, I'm a chairman (Diamond)
Rolex beat, it's time for just winning, no fakes
Just copped more .4 5's and 9's and I ain't talking bout no Js
Please be afraid but I ain't the shooter, Chachi-palooza
Riding shotty in the Chevy bitch old as a cougar
Lyrical Ruger, pop your medulla
You lukewarm, boy, go get you a cooler please
Your bitch know that I'm cooler, please
Your bitch know that I'm cooler, please
So cool I could fucking die if I drop a few degrees
Boss daddy use the porthole please
Get it good girl, use your knees, I love them brainiacs
Yeah, my last ho had a few degrees (For real)
Back on my Compton shit, demonic how I demolish shit
Angelic with my intuition
Student of game make hoes pay tuition (Huh)
No dice, no pill, but I'm on a roll
That one nigga that Kendrick can't control (What)
Problem

[Verse 7: Danny Brown]
(Check!)
That Ambien in my ink pen
Move the brown squares like Wheat Thins
Y'all five days and a weekend
Stay smokin' on that defense
That's two or three and I'm zonin'
Got money like I cloned it
Your bitch came through and I owned it
Rims on the Caddy and I ice cream coned it
Homie, you ain't hitting on nothin'
Drop that top when I hit that button (Beep)
Pimp so hard it's a full time job
Swear, 12 stacks in my glove box
Bitch niggas, tell me what it's gon' be
Young nigga chop it up 223 (Do, do, do ,do)
Come to the D, don't hit OGs
And my advice is stay low-key (Uh-huh)
Bitch we great, bitch we great (Great), fuckin' set (Set)
Bitch we jump up, bitch we jump up, we gotta have it
Gotta get, get, we gotta get, get, we gonna take it first
We jump, said bitch we jump, we gotta make it (Yeah)
Couple racks up on them Wikki stiks
Yo bitch, she smoked my trippy stick
Ridiculous, put dick on tit, spit on clit
And it's over with, I'm over it
No sober shit, drink 'til I just throw up and shit
Y'all ho told me come over here
So guess what nigga it's over with
And it's over with

[Verse 8: Meyhem Lauren]
Fresh out the wave pool, my niggas made cool
We wrote the blueprint for the shit y'all niggas try to do
If I'm not outside, then I'm probably inside your boo
My team's official, you ain't shit, that's why she's trying my crew
Pardon me, I move retardedly
This shit is old to me, the real New York is part of me
I'm always shopping, keep it fly, Lauren is archery
Don't get it twisted, realistic, I could part the sea
My life is fast, I take a chance when I insert the key
And then I turn it up, that's really how you work the V
Your stash ain't never dry if you getting your work from me
We do this fly shit perfectly, we're enough to rise the mercury
Heat nigga, street nigga
Reflect those both when I be rapping on the beat, nigga
Looking Cambodian while standing at the podium
My flow was opium, we cock bottles and open them
Laurenovich

[Verse 9: Raekwon]
Stop by, tryna see a nigga, all I buy is these trees, king
100 ki's in them streets, nigga, mask me up in grease
Sneaker game is lethal, NY, them eagles
Fly through, get high too, fly as hell, might as well
Hire you the live group, come through with that live crew
Birds chirpin', cop that Birkin, boo, yo, I supplied you
Liable to be in Beirut, no Beirut, this debut
Slick, little niggas get gun poundin', keep moving, who saved you?
Play who? Not me, me and Bronson, not we
Two real niggas sitting in the East Coast
Ice is on, heat close
Fuck around and kill one of y'all clown ass niggas, word up
Take your two, take your hat
Take a nap, put your ass ton the ground, little niggas
We pound niggas and drown niggas and
Hemmied up, that brown, niggas
All my niggas get stemi'd up, Hennessy, Louis V
Me and you, me and her, we as one and she is done
Battle rap me three to one, freedom after, kingdom come

[Verse 10: Vado]
Triple hundred K in my duffle
Give a hundred K to my muscle
Slept a hundred days, just wakin' up
Need a brick, just break it up
Break it down, then take the cut
We shave around like a taper cut
I weigh the pound, if you hatin' us
'Bout to paint the town, most hated what
Most hated what
Grab the dice then shake 'em up
Talked hundreds since eight and up
You lost the onions, no makin' up
No blunts but y'all fake as fuck
It's gym time and I'm shapin' up
I've been foulin', when Blake get up
You gon' waste a life, you need to hang it up
Dreams, click clack
Man down with that chrome Uz'
On his back like ""Nigga don't move""
Word to mother, we don't lose
Talk butter like we don't move
See Gutter, be home soon
See Gutter, he'll be home soon

[Bridge: Vado]
What's good? Talk the money, what's good?
Haters frontin', what's good?
I'm pullin' up like, ""What's good?""
You know I got it, what's good?
My people's 'bout it, what's good?
Never stop, we never settle
Gotta push the pedal in that hood
What's good? Talk the money, what's good?
Haters frontin', what's good?
I'm pullin' up like, ""What's good?""
You know I got it, what's good?
My people's 'bout it, what's good?
Never stop, we never settle
Gotta push the pedal in that hood

[Verse 11: Kilo Kish]
I sit in the back of the room, legs crossed, melting wax
Another free drink so soon? All good, knock it back
Red lights, heart attack, just a dream with no end in sight
Waking up to evening, now it seems I live this rotten life
Spoiled rotten life, frozen hair with burning hands
Coming out to dance with other drones who couldn't give a damn
But when the night calls, redcurrant lipstick with the lights off
Look at all the bottles lined up, wondering who they could pop for
Golden ember to the black floor, burning monks to feel the timbre
Part of the action, retweet, now you're the attraction
Sit around and watch them, watch their faces and reactions
Then blur the lines until the sun is back on your horizon

[Verse 12: Juice]
Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe
Inhale, potent marijuana running shit like the mayor
Rap game Peter Parker web swinging through the air
My minds in the clouds and I ain't got a beer
See I ain't got a care kill them now and reap the benefits
Coldest nigga out and I ain't sold no fucking disc
Henny bottle-eater, three grams in the fuckin' spliff
Call it what you want, I'm a zombie, bitch, I'm off this shit

[Verse 13: Erick Arc Elliott]
Yo', Prada never gonna pile up if you can't follow this game, nigga
My team smoking that green
If you ain't seen me then you must be a lame, nigga
And I'll give you three shots hold this heat down
Shorty pussy so wet she could soak a beach towel
But meanwhile, Effortless, so she thought it was a freestyle
Everybody wanna floss like a G now
What about me? Never had a bitch nigga doubt me
Zombie gang all y'all niggas pace is shit
On some basic shit it's no wonder that you sound the same
So forever am I living staying out of prison
Mommy told me different but these hoes don't hear it
Forever am I living staying out of prison
Mommy told me different but these hoes don't hear it

[Verse 14: Meechy Darko]
I heard life's a bitch so I spit and stimulate her clit
Hitting licks Henny shots hitting licks on the ave
Hitting licks who is this? that be Meech
Zombie walking casualty beat the beat till it's actually fragments
Coke off her areola and no not a can of soda
Tearing flesh pussy pink look like Cam's Range Rover
No High school diploma but baby I'm a street soulja
School of the hard knocks every class I leap over
Smith and Wesson .500, long nose, mazel tov
Shoot a man who squeal then I peel like an old cut
Like my women heightened and not even trying
And if she leaky leaky then Meechy gon' dive in
Ha, mic check check me, skin darker than Wesley
Two-eighths of shrooms got me dancing like Mr. Bentley
Mind yo' fuckin' business, why you think the whip is tinted?
The darkest nigga in it sparking up to infinite

[Verse 15: Renegade El Rey]
Renegade, nigga, let's get it straight from the gate
I'ma tell you what it is, I'ma tell you what it ain't
See you ain't gotta question
Or better yet second guess anything that I might say
You see not a single syllable is out of place
I rock a venue, people barely know my name
What I'm tryna tell you is I ain't gotta tell you a fuckin' thing
I'ma show so you know, niggas either do or they don't
And bein' number two is what I won't be
I'm silencin' lambs and sheep, don't sleep
Cause my characteristics are that of a cannibal
Call this shit Hannibal Lecter
My timing's impeccable, sharp like a razorblade
And you look dissectible, I've been on my mind for days
'Cause homie we've been in the grind for years
Southern eagle nigga, fuck 'em all mane, we don't fly in fear
I grew up in the city where they figured they can kill dreams when they kill King
Niggas stay shot, shit stay locked, I stay strapped, fuck you mean?
'Bout my green, I need bread, I'm like ""Fuck the rest""
When I need bread, I'm like ""Fuck the rest""
I be up all night tryna chase the check
Prolly spent it fast, I need to make it back
M.E.M.P.H.I.S, they could never stop me
Check these lames and pimp this game, let's put it in my pocket

[Verse 16: Rockie Fresh]
And they will never know 'bout all the nights that we prayed
All the meetings we took, and all the records we played
I tried to tell 'em I'm the shit, but they told us, ""no way""
With no cuts, they're like a barber, they're about to catch fade
My number one rule is that I gotta get paid
I've been thinkin' this way since I was in the 6th grade
No English, I ain't talk, but boy could add
In the school of hard knocks I'm a fuckin' grad
In these Pumas I'ma run shit, high so I'm above shit
Lame ass niggas I don't fuck with
A Bathing Ape trucker, I'm a fly mothafucka
My team lookin' at me like every time it's supper
Cause they know I'm gon' feed 'em, Rocky been a boss
I ain't worried 'bout the price cause I can clearly pay the cost
I'm the sharpest guy around and I'ma always cut my loss
Then come back for the win, I'ma make it, then I spin

[Verse 17: Pill]
Real West Side nigga, 4.2 bitch
They might pull the piece, somebody call a Buddhist
Your bitch put me high up on a nigga to-do list
You can do that, fuck nigga do this
And yeah I'm from the slimiest place where the bombs are pacin'
Niggas call me Jason when the guns are chasin'
Might hit 'em with the TEC, yeah the foul is flagrant
You be on gay shit
Hand in the bowl when your hand really cold
Work the light in the day shift
I don't really give a fuck as long as I get paid shift
New Cadillac, chopper, no new blade shit
I go crazy on this beat right now
I really gotta go and spit heat right now
Don't matter what the fuck it's Prada
Well fitting suits eating on clam chowder
Knock it out the park like Erik Estrada
Remember I was shoppin' at Family Dollar
Got your main bitch Facebookin', beggin' for a swallow
Pop this pill then I pop my collar
Park this shit then I toss a couple dollars
Instagram, gon' post for some follows
I've been in and out my zone if you really wanna know
I got Hen and got Patron if you're really tryna go

[Verse 18: Bodega Bamz]
Oh, you don't know Bamz? I'm what the music game need
Like Rich when he just came home
And then gave the keys to a cherry 3 Series
Oh, you don't know Bamz? Fucker, that AK go chopped
7:30 my time, I'm on psychiatric watch
Oh, you don't know Bamz? Show and prove for what?
I got XXL mula, I got bitches tryna get fucked
Oh, you don't know Bamz? Now you're dead, pussy boy catch up
Pool junkie rack up, nigga, act up
Trunk with the MAC, truck bulletproofed up
Oh, you don't know Bamz? Double parked on murder lane
187 my address, Boulevard of Pain
Oh, you don't know Bamz? My cellphone backed up
My clientele meet once, no voice mail, just call me up, uh
646 684 01 01, hit me up when you want that coke
Hit me up when you want more drugs
646 684 01 01, hit me up when you want that coke
Hit me up when you want more drugs

[Verse 19: Remy Banks]
As I sit back and roll up this black demeanor
Reminiscing on my past, still dreaming about that Bimmer
Shit, I never was that kid in the streets gripping on Ninas
Instead, I was that nigga puffin' reefer, fucking lolitas
With the baddest features
Dog 'em then it's onto the next like I do my sneakers
That was the life I was living, careless about their feelings
Caught cheating, ask for forgiveness, of course I got my way
But now I'm older and wiser, cruising through summer days
With a little Ma riding in the passenger, she rolling up that lavender
Purple cannabis rapture, head high like a Jersey in the rafters
You wing a Frazier, some smart players until we major
Traveling the world, collecting paper, pissing off these haters
Come back home and invest in something then ball out later
In five star restaurants high as hell when I tip my waiter
Providing for my seed when I bring one in this world
But until that day gets here I'm thinking about these joints, twerk

[Verse 20: Killer Mike]
Lord have mercy
I'm so motherfucking fresh to death, better call my hearse
My hearse a 72442 with an all wood wheel and that bitch'll vert
My Oldmobile is a cold mobile
Got a cold, young chick down in Mobile
My stacks so fat can't even hold that
Fold that, lay flat like I lack no wheel
Lay flat like I lack no wheels for real
A nigga had to cold the corner, move crack for real
Move crack for real, no rap shit
But I rap rap shit, my rap shit for real
So you rapping ass rabbit ass ratchet ass niggas
Gotta listen to these raps for real
Cuz, I don't give a fuck if you a Blood or a cuz
'Cause I draw blood for real
Tryna hang in my city, tryna see a bitch titty, no pity
Nigga, you'll get hit for real
These maggot ass hoes ain't hit on shit
They'll set you up for the loot shit, man
Thinking that's your bitch, better have your shit
Better have quick hands like Gucci Mane
Niggas tryna get a brick of Kathy Lee Gifford
Better be strapped like Clifford
It's the big, black nigga gripper of the big black pistol
I suggest you confess where you keeping all the money, mister
At the worst you'll see a hearse
But at the best he just will pistol whip ya
Get to see you child and live
Lord have mercy, please forgive 'em, gone

[Verse 21: Del Harris]
Young Del God is handsome, your girl, she's on ransom
She don't wanna come back, cause you don't make her cum
On the beats I do go dumb and I do her till she numb
And I make her soaking wet when she grab that water gun
Now fuck that brag rap, man, I'm Batman, I'm Bruce Wayne
I'm kickin' it, I'm Liu Kang, I'm killing these niggas, they're too lame
Unorthodox, they too tame, I'm right hand but play left
I'll chop a trend down 'til there ain't no more plain left
Now pay respect to them gods, niggas
Not talkin' church, I'm talkin' rides niggas
On boulevards when we ride, hovercrafts cause we fly
Q Gang 'til I die, pyramid on my eye
Button up on my chest, right now chain on top, no tie
While I'm choppin' up this Thai food
Young Del God make god moves
Young Del God say ""fuck fate"", if I lose then I choose to
This that chateau rap, that shit that niggas ain't used to
Might salad fork while I choose to while I'm fine dining on YouTube, bruh
I'm a king, I said that I'm a king
Go to Onyx with a Onyx on, Nefertiti on my ring

[Verse 22: YG]
I'm back in this bitch bashing, these rappers be swagger jacking
Clap 'em not, they don't even matter, one two, this lung been splattered
And I heat a pistol on something, I keep a fifth on the belt
Pulling out the needles with the liable, make sure it ain't sitting on the shelf
Cause I ain't light on the body, fuck waiting in your lobby
Hannah Montana finally did grew up, I've been waiting on Miley
I'm gangbanging 'til I break my fingers
'Til all my family members speak the slanguage
I ain't even drop no album yet
Off mixtapes, that's how I've been maintaining
If you offended, nigga, sorry, in backs there is bodies
Have your best friend, cuzzo, uncle, pops and another
Bury you in front of everybody
If I ain't been who you are, I don't fuck with you
If I fuck with you, then I'm stuck with you
I'm stuck with you, I'll shoot it out
Do some years and a couple months with you, woo

[Verse 23: CyHi da Prince]
Lyrically I am the epitome of a real MC
Biblically I am Timothy, visually I am Tripoli
Full of bigotry, fighting with Gaddafi over liberty
Politically I'm Barack smoking pot, sipping Hennessy
That's my only vice, old school noisy pipes
I ain't tryna be the richest, I'm cool with an M like Obie Trice
Rappers sing the same song, it must be karaoke night
That shit sound like you sang the hokey pokey twice
But this the main event, can't tell me that I ain't a prince
A one-hit wonder to your girl cause I came and went
But this that fly talk, smoke it, you'll get high off
The best thing to happen to the street since the sidewalk
Or the stop sign, or the shots flying
From a Glock 9, now the block crying, I don't freestyle, I jot mine
Call me Mr. 1-800, all I got is hotlines
These niggas tell so many stories they can overlook the skyline
Biatch

[Verse 24: Young Thug]
Thugger! Y'all got me drunk as hell, uh
Now I been red since I was little like Robin Hood
They been hatin' on me, cutting my cable cords
They gon' hate on her when she come in Michael Kors
Meanwhile, your bitch in the 'Lac, grippin' this wood
I want you
She went to grabbin' for my jewels, I told her
Buy yourself a squad, and you can roll it, roll it
She know she can't have it, that shit love my woadie
She want to buy him a chinchilla
She see I'm servin' foreign country boys from the village
Always, I gotta stand her
No, she don't want nobody else to eat but her
She be like fuck them bitches, stack the digits
Compliment this Fendi fit, condiment or sentimental
She ride three deep with molly in the middle
Put Micky Thompsons all on my Jeep
Ain't got no handprint on my golds, they all on the seat
Ten-thousand-dollar toe ring, featured by E
Bitches know it's time out
This bitch be fucking me so good, I be like, ""Time out!""
They want to fuck me 'til I tell 'em all to time out
And how she stroke it, I can't coach it, I'm like, ""Time out!""
I'm not no snitch, but I be tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
Tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
I'm so tired of tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em
Tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, tellin' 'em, now I'ma show 'em
Her posse beat me by the threes, I call 'em Reggie Miller
She roll my weed in giant 'gar, she tall like 'Zilla, I want you
Baby, don't you run from me, you know I want you
She down with Slime, she got a tattoo of an anaconda
Thugger getting high in London
Bitches walking 'round naked, no pajamas
Lil' homie ranned off with lots of lumber
For that, I'm gonna fuck your aunt, your sis, your mama
Then pop a bean together
She want to feel just like I feel, we growin' wings together
Everything perfect about her, can't get my thing together
I turn her up and we shit out earthlings together
Just do it like Mykko Montana, my father say I got stamina
I'm cooking the Hannah Montana-na, I bury these hoes like sandals them
I kill every one of my features, I spend all my money on divas
My pockets on yellow pages, just like a beeper

[Verse 25: A$ton Matthews]
They found Max B prints in my way
Bitch, I rode the Red Sea through my biblical days
No roof, snow boots, and that Persian Mercedes
Perving the 80's, you ain't never surf with the Brady's
Ric Flair, a heavyweight champion
Got Trish Stratus with them panties on singing ""daddy's home""
Bust it, in these Space Jams, I'm a Monstar
Do-rag, tote on, that cake blocked in an arm war
So rumble, young man, rumble
Young killa when he came out the jungle
Young dealer in the rains with the bundles
Gets no realer, get chipped when you stumble
Eat the ox on the foil, ten toes in the soil
Chop chop 'till he drop, fuck what you thought
I never leave my life with a lawyer
Eyes wide with my head on the swivel
Choose a side or get left in the middle
I just treat with the sand on the beach
When the desert eagles meet, then I'm finna beat
Rest them in their sleep, you can lose 'em to the beef
Move or we shooting in the jeep
Homicide coming through the sneaks
Your hands ain't moving with your cheek
Bag 'em up and move 'em up the creek

[Verse 26: Prodigy]
On my test, got a story to 'em
Like all my raps weigh more than music
The more I write, the better I do it and right now my stock is up
I do me from day one, huh, my nigga you know where it hit fours
Still fuck with me at day one hundred, cause I don't play, I gets off
Piss off, bitch, you ain't lit, you just a nigga saying shit
Rappers burn out faster than cancer sticks
Mobb Deep is that truth, liar, Prodigy is that fuel fire
Come try me, I show better than tell, Infamous empire
I'm on point like the state building
I stay sharper than razor blades
Think you doing the most, I give you the most
Slashes to the face, hoes like ""he so angry"", uh
Trust me bitch, you gon' thank me
Cause when it pop and the smoke gone
We gon' walk outta here safely
Fuck with me, I got you, real nigga, no costume
This modern art that I spit, it's not no bullshit, and colossal
So pour it up, pour it up, that's how we ball out
Cause when I bomb on these niggas it's worse than nuclear fall out

[Verse 27: CUZ Lightyear (a.k.a. SL Jones)]
Keep the small bills separate from the hundreds, please
That bank vault can't talk but the numbers read
And the tellers makin' statements, breakin' all the codes
This ain't a mothafuckin' date, we takin' all the hoes
Shop 'til I drop, freshest corpse in the morgue
Lookin' like a fashion fossil, I'm Gianni reborn
Four, I was voted most likely to trap
It's survival of the trillest, nigga, die or adapt
Waste a lot of champagne but I don't waste a drop of time
Public with my gang relations, throwin' up the proper signs
Sawed off the shotty, got the chopper circumcised
Chevy so clean, look like I dipped that bitch in turpentine
All my homies certified, hottest nigga outchea
Looked like Joan, we burned alive
Thought that I would ball 'til I fall, then I learned to fly
Spread my wings
They say success is contagious so I share my dreams

[Verse 28: Nasty Nigel]
Bolo swingin' from left to right
I'm not a cholo but I know hoes out in SoHo lovin' my ethnic type
When I smile for the photo looking like Lobo
Me and my bloodshot eyes,I pass on the Bud Light Lime
Just pass me that brew of St. Ides
Got cash, I ain't gotta think twice
Unconventional shit, pretentious hipsters that diss
Half-assed review on Fader, still get no love from Pitchfork
Nigel Rubirosa, que la cosa? Feet up on the sofa
Heat up on the holster, World's Fair! Yeah, you know us
11-36-8 be the zip code
Corona, Queens nigga, that's what I call home
Feet on the dash, mind on the ass
Racin' the Sun just so I can get dome
Pimped the shorties I've been with
My friends that had me evicted
It's been two years and I'm slippin'
Still got no pot to piss in
As far as everyone goes, they can suck and kneel on it
We have another song, gotta fuckin' feel it
Got my eyes on the Harley and I'm trying to peel it
Had my eyes on the bitch but she married Keaton
Got no job so I'm hardly eatin'
And you eatin' then we fuckin' beefin'
I need a pie and pizza just to meet up for a fuckin' feature

[Verse 29: Bobby Creekwater]
Man, they don't wanna see a nigga
Winning in a mothafucka, happier than a mothafucka
You know lightweight grinnin' in a mothafucka
When you're a dead guy and you on that high
So the whole world spinnin' in a mothafucka
And a couple young angels hide their halo
Cause they're 'bout to start sinnin' in a mothafucka
They don't wanna see a nigga on the upswing
In a black tux with cufflinks
When you're the reason that every single girl in the party
Wanna dance and cuff drinks
When you're the reason that shit gets ran
And mothafuckas wheezin' to keep up with the plan
And the other niggas show up at your function
Actin' all anti-social, no, a nigga fan
Run up on your mama puttin' money in her hand
And you do that shit again and again and again
Pull up in the 8, goin' home with a 10
And you really can't defend or depend on your friends
Ex girlfriend wanna key up the Benz
When the Sun comes up, nigga we up to win
Mothafuck you man, all you do is set trends
And you do that shit again and again and again

[Verse 30: Action Bronson]
Ugh, ugh, got those motherfucking custom Roshes, feel me?
This big beard cover my face
Until my mother gets her first crib
My hand's on some surf shit, my Spanish mami perfect
Fuck around and get your father's shirt lift
Drop a thousand on some sake and some urchin
Swing the Dodge Viper lefty like I'm Randy Johnson
Hand me the Thompson, I'll spill your clams on the carpet
Then eat some snails with some garlic, paint the town with a harlot
Cream FILAs and Carhartt, three-wheelin out the car lot
Put the snorkel on the Wrangler cause I'm silly
I chip a little piece of brick into the Philly
My daughter's neck is chilly, my son's neck is chilly
My mother wrist so cut look like it got bit by a grizzly
And these drugs got me spinning like some capoeira
Still rock the slow beats with gold teeth, ain't afraid to hold heat
Control the Jeep, that's for the slow creep
Ya fuckin' pussy smells like old meat
It's me

[Verse 31: Heems]
Heema the highest human, flyest cumin in my unit
I ?, the shorties swoonin', and they want to get to spoonin'
Never wished i was taller, himanshu ain't no midget
Never wished i was a baller, if I want it, then I get it
I built a fucking blueprint, like who the fuck you kidding?
I'm ridin' around and I'm gettin' it, if it's mine, I'm spending
You lames and you fall, I'm like 2 Chainz when I ball
Got Husseins on my feet and Husains on my wall
Hussein Chalayans, a pretty girl said that's fancy
Unless his name is Hussein, give a fuck who your mans be
My shoes got dials, they ain't got laces
If you got beef, I show up with many faces
Been to many places where we leaving many casings
Running 'round, man, but we never catch no cases
Give a fuck about what you say, kicking it with like two babes
Top off, toupee, hot as fuck, creme brûlée

[Verse 32: Mike G]
There's no way I can care about much
You probably do the most and it's never enough
King Midas, I can make gold with a touch
Change my location to awesome, you should address me as such
Swear this game, you have to know it like the back of your hand
Destined to be like Superman for as long as you can
Wondering what's the purpose without living a life so grand
The worst hand is having the world without a master plan
I feel like you gotta pardon Mike for taking over this Earth
Despite sleepless nights and long flights
And I don't like discussions unless it concerns a price
If you make it out of spite, you still make it so it's alright
I spit magic, so cold and lavish
Bad broads perform sexual acts in traffic
So smooth, the saxophone and jazz is
It's horrendous what you lack and focus on what you have in the G
More than average, I'm nothing to test
If it's to me, you step and contest, then bring your best
Give it your all, now women beg me to call
And unless we overseas, we don't shop in the mall
Consider this move so private I've become urban myth
My aim is so swift, with this I can't miss
Top notch, number one on everybody's list
I promise to kill them all 'til everybody's missed

[Verse 33: Yak Ballz]
I never sell drugs, I took 'em, I don't write rhymes, I cook 'em
I'm from the Old New York
Where you got your chain snatched and your kicks tooken
I put my city up like I'm bench pressin'
Scorin' high off the fresh pressses, brutal, last in 10 seconds
Jolly good, body good, I met a stripper named Hollywood
In Hollywood, glass slipper and she gave me the sloppy goooood
So you should tip her if you execute, young leisure suit
Larry with no extra loot, my ex left me destitute
So chances are I don't remember you if I slept with you
You want karats, I'm turnin' rappers to vegetables
City of God, I'm askin' what would the devil do?
Instagram it, I forever rule, Ricky

[Verse 34: Zebra Katz]
Super villain, I'm killin', kick in the door
Watch me spillin' 'em, fuckin' winnin'
Straight killin' haters, they catchin' them feelings
See me grillin', me drillin', me like we chillin'
But really see I'm fulfillin' their fantasies
Like I'm fuckin' my frienemies
Yo what's up, see me on motherfucker tryna get buck
Where in the world did he get that from?
When the bass drop down and he kick that drum (drum)
So what's up? Where in the world did he get that from?
Where in the world did he get that from?
When the bass drop down and he kick that drum
Yeah I've been known to really fuck it up
No damn, no shit, not zip zap zup
Speedin' on the highway, Bronco truck
When you ask for the Katz, mothafucka here I come
Yeah I've been known to really fuck it up
No damn no shit zip zap zup
Speedin' on the highway, Bronco truck
When you ask for the Katz, mothafucka here I come

[Bridge: Zebra Katz]
A muthafucka need that work? Well I got it right here
Need motivation for the ass to gon' twerk? Well I got it right here
If you need that thing, that thing, then I got it right here
Yeah, motherfucker, I got it right here, I got it right here
A muthafucka need that work? Well I got it right here
Need motivation for the ass to gon' twerk? Well I got it right here
If you need that thing, that thing, then I got it right here
Yeah muthafucka, I-- muthafucka I got it right here

[Verse 35: Curtis Williams]
I said most of these niggas gon' hate, me and my niggas get paid
One nigga swing then we all gon swing, we all gon catch that case
Couple blunts to the face, got a nigga straight
Rappin' on beats got a young nigga made
What can I say? My closet got Bape
I don't do delays, I want it today
Noisy pack in my wrap, Hennessy in my cup
Ginger ale if I chase, but I really don't do that much
I really don't have no time, you ain't tryin' to get no funds
Doin' this shit 'til I die, I'm rollin' and smokin' on drugs

[Verse 36: Reese]
Rollin' up, chokin' up on the kush smoke
Whip sick, big wheels, Big Willie shit
Hot boxer, hot sauna, car full, thick
I love the constituents, is down to get their lids peeled
Still pimpin', ridin' 'round town gettin' low
With my bright skin shawty, call her light show
She like Reese I'm tryna light that
Show love, she hold me down like an ice pack
It's big faces on faces bruh, big faces on faces bruh
Dead men in my pockets got me goin' up
It's goin' face down if a nigga flex us
Yeah, in God we trust, but bands is a must
We gotta get that, spend that, get that
Re-up, recoup, repeat that

[Verse 37: Dave]
Say deuce 9 in that ending, been winning since the beginning
Did a couple shows, need a couple more
That price right but we skippin'
But to our niggas, we gettin' it with that work I turn into a chemist
Walter White, send a cake to my niggas locked up in prison
Free my nigga Chris, and free my uncle Marky
Now tell them they fucked up
When they told 'em they could start me
Cause I ain't lettin' up, they're talkin' 'bout the best
They better mention us, yeah they better mention us

[Verse 38: LightSkinMac11]
Apartment off Rocky, rottweiler just to watch it
Maybachs for the profit, get a Lexus for my mama
Hail Marys for our fathers, press the pedal to get farther
In that new thing, no tags, nigga, fuck the dollar
All about it so don't fuckin' bother
My loose change got me Bruce Wayne, and a 3 page spread
I was sleepin' on the flow, just a couple months later
Now I'm purchasing the flow, East Coast

[Verse 39: Alkebulan]
King, god, pharoah
Feared the sensei, gold for bone marrow, save
My name is running coyote
I'm on peyote with the queen, running on waves
I will make water out of Hennessy
Target my ankh, I was born a public enemy
Reign insurmountable
A woman will make me climax but she won't be ending me
This is not a dream, marchin', in all black
A Black Clan king, respect the illustrator
Don't you dare ever try the Elohim, fuck flexin'
I say my name when I name drop, son
Who's the god in this pantheon?
Two-9, Alkebulan, Alkebulan, Alkebulan, Alkebulan

[Verse 40: CEEJ]
Get up kid, put your head to your knees like a sit-up, bitch
Get too live for the crew, Two-9
We're the new 2 Live Crew, give up, bitch
Send 'em all to Hell, kill this shit
Spit it like braille, gotta feel this shit
Gotta check up, haters still sick
Yellin' kill 'em all and I'm on ball like I'm Billups, bitch

[Verse 41: Jace]
Runnin' our heart, sit up bitch
Hard to go to sleep, all we know is work
Catch no Zs, chilled on purp
And ya bitch came second but my bills on first
East Side nigga, still my turf
Pierce like 'Matic, hoes still at it
Swing like a batter and my crew goin' at it
Best believe that that shit gon' hurt

[Verse 42: Alexander Spit]
Toot up the French horn, the fog machine is sandstorm
Ain't go to camp
Cordless toward the performer that's keepin' your amps warm
'Fore the fans swarm all but the limousine
Swear to God that's in between
Indigo indie dream, you intervene, yeah, that's a Spit 16
Hearts inside of my tip jar, like a bleedin' heart beneath wood floor
And if every lion is purrin' then I'ma be certain I let my engine roar
I'm swingin' swords and swingin' chains
Singin' pure and bangin' strange
This Alexander Spit and I'm off the wall like Vans, I'm changin' lanes
Driftin' around whatever it is this game became
Like gorillas and orangutans, go bananas and bangarang
They say I'm prayin' to that cross for all of that 15 minute fame
But I'ma get in your ears and the god's here
So baby just open your bra zip and just let them titties out
And let 'em bounce like this was Paul Revere
I'm 7.0in' on Pitchfork, I'm 10-0in' on this court
This Alexander Spit with a pistol, dro is full of his disorders, I got this

[Verse 43: ScottyATL]
Better have my check, I need that first
Before I move, before I step
See I been burned it don't take long
And learn quick, it ain't no twice
I gave my time, I gave my life
So I won't bet what all I spent
I'm trying to be good, I'll take your bitch
And I ain't even playin, just ask my clique
You know my steez, trying to get real A-Town
Got that or either got sump'n to give away
Big feet on the bottom of a Chevrolet
Everybody and they mamma sell plenty hay
Need to ride with the weight scale
Propped up in the seat trying to get that
My broad on da eastside ho nigga
Tell Bron Bron we can bring the Heat back
I'm a champ, I support it, flipping through the hundred
Cool Club with it, running to the money
I'm in shape, I'm in shape stacking cake
Duncan Hines go get ""Faith"" thats my last tape
I'm on 10, I'm on fire, I'm on point, I'm on smash
Rolly on my dash, breaking down in my Cad'
I'm Atlanta, ScottyATL ho 1 space that's a Y not an IE
Slipped in ain't even check ID, game need me I'ma rap IV

[Verse 44: Da$h]
Year before '83, I be the kid who found ET
Tell him teach me all he know, prolly make him smoke some dope
Call a bitch over for throat and put her on some game
Just to get up in her brain and now she out makin' me change
I'm full of dynamite, throw her on the blade, no Wesley Snipes
Young Roxanne, baby, sell that body to the night
I'm trife as fuck, light the blunt, get high enough to die for once
Throw the pad at Christ, they askin' God how do I write this stuff
The Lord never liked me much, but I'm sayin', ""Oh well""
Blazin' up with the devil, watchin' old Hell in the Cell
Matches your favorite actress, blasted, naked on my mattress
Polygraphs break, you say I ain't the illest nigga rappin'
The fucking  captain of this multi million dollar faction
Commander and chief, my sons is Son of Sam with the beef
We get loot, always ran from police
You bitch niggas lose your head if you speak
I ash the doobie off the cruise ship
And flew hash, cheffin' out of Ruth Chris
Two bitches tellin' me they do sniff
What do you know? So much wax in this blunt I'm smokin'
You'd thinkin' I'm fuckin' Madame Tussauds
You think I'm fuckin' mad, I'm too so
I'm out of it, bitch, oh, nah, fuck that
Bring them fuckin' trumpets back
Light a dub sack for my niggas who slung crack
On a daily basis, sip liquor, I never chase it

But with you
It's not like that at all
There's a girl
That gives a shit
Behind this wall
You just walk through it

And I remember all those crazy thing you said
You left them running through my head
You're always there, you're everywhere

426,426,When We Stand Together,"[Verse 1]
One more depending on a prayer
And we all look away
People pretending everywhere
It's just another day
There's bullets flying through the air
And they still carry on
We watch it happen over there
And then just turn it off

[Chorus]
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
We must stand together
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
There's no giving in
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
Hand in hand forever
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
That's when we all win
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
That's, that's, that's when we all win
That's, that's, that's when we all win

[Verse 2]
They tell us everything's alright
And we just go along
How can we fall asleep at night
When something's clearly wrong?
When we could feed a starving world
With what we throw away
But all we serve are empty words
That always taste the same

[Chorus]
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
We must stand together
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
There's no giving in
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
Hand in hand forever
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
That's when we all win
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
That's, that's, that's when we all win
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
That's, that's, that's when we all win

[Bridge]
The right thing to guide us
Is right here inside us
No one can divide us
When the light is nearly gone
But just like a heartbeat
The drumbeat carries on
And the drumbeat carries on
Just like a heartbeat

[Chorus]
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
We must stand together
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
There's no giving in
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
Hand in hand forever
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah

I'm a wild boy, fuck an eighth, I need O's

[Chorus: MGK]
Yeah, bitch, yeah, bitch, call me Steve-O

[Verse 1: MGK]
I'm a east side Cleveland wild boy, east side Cleveland wild boy
We got baseball bats like the Indians, and my team pop off like Cowboys
You a ""white-flag, throw-that-towel"" boy I'm a ""jump-right-in-that-crowd"" boy
You a ""shhh, keep-it-down"" boy, and I'm a ""fuck-you, blow-that-loud"" boy
All I know is how to kill every one of my cells
All they know is they can kill anybody but Kells
I am untouchable, you would think I was in jail
But I'm in Mexico getting marijuana from Miguel
Bring it back into the States, put it on a scale
Measure it at half a eighth, put it in a shell
Split it then I roll it, then light it up like it's Independence Day I got a bottle rocket, put it in the air
Snapback with my city on it
Text back with your titties on it
Levi's, put your kitty on it
Start grindin' like the Clipse is on it
Drink it 'til I get pissy, biatch
Smoke it 'til I get dizzy, biatch
Lose Control like Missy, but I'm a Bad Boy 'cause I'm with Diddy, bitch!

[Bridge: MGK]
There he go, that's John Doe
There he go, that's John Doe
Yeah, there he go, that's John Doe
Nevermind, that's just Kells with that heat
No LeBron though

[Chorus: MGK]
Yeah, bitch, yeah, bitch, call me Steve-O
Yeah, bitch, yeah, bitch, call me Steve-O
I'm a wild boy, I'm a, I'm a wild boy
I'm a wild boy, fuck an eighth I need O's
Yeah, bitch, yeah, bitch, call me Steve-O
Yeah, bitch, yeah, bitch, call me Steve-O
I'm a wild boy, I'm a, I'm a wild boy
I'm a wild boy, fuck an eighth I need O's

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Bricksquad! Oh, here come that bullshit
Beat a nigga ass 'til the DJ stop the music
They say they want that wild shit, mosh pit
Jump up in the crowd bitch
I'm so mothafuckin' violent
Yeah, bitch, yeah, bitch, I'm with Steve-O
We bustin' bottles with bad bitches, blowin' weed smoke
Yeah, bitch, yeah, bitch, I'm with Steve-O
Royal Rumble in the club, John Ce-no
I'm screamin' ""Riverdale"" everywhere I go
I throw them bands ho, drop it low
Fuck 5-0, I make my own rules
Suck my dragon balls bitch, call me Goku
(Yeah!) this liquor got the best of me
(Yeah!) this liquor got the best of me
Machine Gun Kelly, Flocka, that's the recipe
You gon' need King Kong if you step to me

[Bridge: MGK]
Yeah, Cobain's back, yeah, Cobain's back
Got these crazy white boys yellin' ""Cobain's back""
I call my weed Nirvana, smells like Teen Spirit
And my packs so fuckin' loud you can't hear it!

428,428,Crawling Back To You,"[Verse 1]
Lessons learned and bridges burn to the ground
And it's too late now to put out the fire
Tables turned and I'm the one who's burning now
Well, I'm doing alright
'Til I close my eyes
And then I see your face
And it's no surprise

[Chorus]
Just like that, I'm crawling back to you
Just like you said I would, yeah
I swallowed my pride, now I'm crawling back to you
Yeah, I'm out of my head, can't wait any longer
Down on my knees, I thought I was stronger
Just like that, like you said I'd do
Yeah, I'm crawling back to you

[Verse 2]
Time can heal, but the scars only hide the way you feel
And it's hard to forget how I left you hangin'
On by a thread, with everything I said, I regret it, yeah
Well, I was doing alright, thought I could make it
Then I see your face and it's hard to fake it

[Chorus]
Just like that, I'm crawling back to you
Just like you said I would, yeah
I swallowed my pride, now I'm crawling back to you
Yeah, I'm out of my head, can't wait any longer
Down on my knees, I thought I was stronger
Just like that, like you said I'd do
Yeah, I'm crawling back to you

[Verse 3]
If you could find a way to forgive everything, I know you would
And I would take it all back if only I knew that I could
Lessons learned and bridges burn to the ground
And it's too late now to put out the fire

[Chorus]
Just like that, I'm crawling back to you
Just like you said I would, yeah
I swallowed my pride, now I'm crawling back to you
Yeah, I'm out of my head, can't wait any longer
Down on my knees, I thought I was stronger
Just like that, like you said I'd do
Yeah, I'm crawling back to you

I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly

Uh yo, yo
I wish today it will rain all day
Maybe that will kinda make the pain go away
Trying to forgive you for abandoning me
Praying but I think I'm still an angel away
Angel away, yeah strange in a way
Maybe that is why I chase strangers away
They got their guns out aiming at me
But I become Neo when they aiming at me
Me, me, me against them
Me against enemies, me against friends
Somehow they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood
They start coming and I start rising
Must be surprising, I'm just surmising
I win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher, more fire
I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive

To fly

Uh yo, yo
Everybody wanna try to box me in
Suffocating every time it locks me in
Paintin' they own pictures than they crop me in
But I will remain where the top begins
'Cause I am not a word, I am not a line
I am not a girl that can ever be defined
I am not fly, I am levitation
I represent an entire generation
I hear the criticism loud and clear
That is how I know that the time is near
So we become alive in a time of fear
And I ain't got no motherfucking time to spare
Cry my eyes out for days upon days
Such a heavy burden placed upon me
But when you go hard your nay's become yay's
Yankee Stadium with Jay's and Kanye's

I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise

431,431,Set You Free,"[Chorus]
Who-ooh-ooh-ooh are you anyways?
I can't count how many days you weren't here
The walls were closing in on me
But I don't live in there no more (No more)

[Verse 1]
There's a place in my head
That repeats what you said
That repeats what you said that day
You're afraid the mistakes that you made
Dug your grave but
Baby that's the price you pay

[Pre-Chorus]
So don't shut down
This town, ain't big enough for both of us, whoa
And now I've found
You'll never get enough from me
So, baby, I'm a set you free
Yeah I'm a set you free

[Chorus]
Who-ooh-ooh-ooh are you anyways?
I can't count how many days you weren't here
The walls were closing in on me
But I don't live in there no more (No more)
Who-ooh-ooh-ooh are you anyways?
I can't count how many days you weren't here
The walls were closing in on me (Closing in)
But I don't live in there no more (No more)

[Verse 2]
I been trying to relate to
All the things that make you
Act the crazy ways you do (You do)
But that will take patience and headaches
To make sense
Some the things you put me through

[Pre-Chorus]
So don't shut down
This town, ain't big enough for both of us, whoa
And now I've found
You'll never get enough from me
So, baby, I'm a set you free
Yeah, I'm a set you free

[Chorus]
Who-ooh-ooh-ooh are you anyways?
I can't count how many days you weren't here
The walls were closing in on me
But I don't live in there no more (No more)
Who-ooh-ooh-ooh are you anyways?
I can't count how many days you weren't here
The walls were closing in on me (Closing in)
But I don't live in there no more (No more)

[Bridge]
All the pictures and the windows on the wall
Are closing in on me
I thought that you're suppose to learn from
What went wrong in history
So you keep doing everything you can
And never will get to me
I bet you remember the day you were better
As soon as we severed
And you were free
All the pictures and the windows on the wall
Are closing in on me
I thought that you're suppose to learn from
What went wrong in history
So you keep doing everything you can
And never will get to me
I bet you remember the day you were better
As soon as we severed
And you were free

[Chorus]
Who-ooh-ooh-ooh are you anyways?
I can't count how many days you weren't here
The walls were closing in on me (Closing in)
But I don't live in there no more (No more)
Who-ooh-ooh-ooh are you anyways?
I can't count how many days you weren't here
The walls were closing in on me (Closing in)
But I don't live in there no more (No more)

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I apologize, I don’t recollect your name
(Oh, baby, I don’t know your name)
But lemme tell you that them heels, really complement your frame
(Look at your body, baby)
Girl lemme get them ""ooh-ahhs""
Then I gotta catch my plane
Say ya miss me and ya wishing for some private time
Girl, how could we get that way?
Girl, how could we get that way?

[Verse 1: Wale]
Look, another day, another dollar
She hate me when I leave cause when I leave I never call her
That's life, shit, aight, shit, I could call you right quick
But if I call, you gon' be like, ""Boo, why we haven't skyped yet?""
And on Skype, bet you say, ""'Le, where my flight at?""
If I decline then you inquire on where I spend my nights at
Shit this life gets overwhelming and more then hectic
But a woman worth some anger is certainly worth some effort
Just look closer, my life is quite deceptive
Women'll sell they soul, just to buy some attention
I need something to hold, fuck that passive aggression
And when I'm back from off that road, don't ask me no questions
Please, fear what you don't know, haha

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I apologize, I don’t recollect your name
(Oh, baby, I don’t know your name)
But lemme tell you that them heels, really complement your frame
(Look at your body, baby)
Girl lemme get them ""ooh-ahhs""
Then I gotta catch my plane
Say ya miss me and ya wishing for some private time
Girl, how could we get that way?
Girl, how could we get that way?

[Verse 2: Wale]
Don't remember how I met her, but I know I won't forget her
And If loving her is wrong then I just know I won't see Heaven
She say she from Seattle, she 20 and some change
Before I get to T.I.A, I'm sure to make her rain
Then I'm back up on my plane, Chi-town O'Hare
We spend some time and get some wine, have some milds from Harold's
I told her this here's overrated, but I love your city baby
Gotta get back to the D, you know we finally famous
Driver drop me off at Dulles, I'm headed to some money
TSA be laughing, all them rubbers in your luggage
I know I'ma always leave 'em, but I swear I'll always love 'em
Tell her you'll probably find someone but you'll never find another
Wale, oww!

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I apologize, I don’t recollect your name
(Oh, baby, I don’t know your name)
But lemme tell you that them heels, really complement your frame
(Look at your body, baby)
Girl lemme get them ""ooh-ahhs""
Then I gotta catch my plane
Say ya miss me and ya wishing for some private time
Girl, how could we get that way?
Girl, how could we get that way?

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Got on my suede shoes, I'm in a great mood
Air baggage claim, awaiting miss thang out of St. Louis
Know she shining bright, got on my Cartier
She my Billie Jean, we menage with Mary Jane
See we city hop, Vegas to LA
Brings a lot of joy, Bugatti boy, that's lane to lane
Our faucets used to drip, I used to ride the bench
But it was written in cursive for this king to exist
Packed her bags now she live amongst entrepreneurs
Marc Jacob the makeup, she Givenchy consumer
Gianni Versaci connoisseur, a carnivore
Accountable for a half a million uncounted for, boy
Hahahah (M-M-Maybach Music)

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I apologize, I don’t recollect your name
(Oh, baby, I don’t know your name)
But lemme tell you that them heels, really complement your frame

433,433,Play The Guitar,"[Intro: T.I.]
B.o.B. play the guitar
(B.o.B., B.o.B., B.o.B., B.o.B.) play the guitar
B.o.B. play the guitar
(B.o.B., B.o.B., B.o.B., B.o.B.) play the guitar

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Well it's B.o.B, flyer than a stewardess
Fresh to death like I'm dressed for a eulogy
My outfit's retarded, my flow is the stupidest, dumb
I'll probably need to after school tutor it
Balling on beats, got hops like breweries
Sideline haters need to chill where the cooler is
Dr. J flow, you can call me Julius
Y'all take shots; I direct: movie shit
Grand Hustle champion, all I do is ball 'em up
Niggas starting conversations just so they can talk us up
If you ain't running shit you can't even walk with us
Still I'm chill; blunt wider than a coffee cup
You know it's B.o, I do this for the people
Stacking c-notes, pockets on Cee-Lo
Uhm, I'm killing 'em Mama - I'm talking hockey mask
I do it to death, swag on body bag
This beat is out of here, it's gone
Farewell, so long, so long (sayonara)
I'm sayonara, the way I'm gone
So far away there ain't no signal on my phone
Cuz I'm a star, so when I hit the bar it's like Cheers
Everybody knows who you are
Who would've thought I would've took it this far?
Play the guitar

[Hook: T.I.]
Play the guitar, play the guitar, play the guitar
(B.o.B., B.o.B., B.o.B., B.o.B.) play the guitar
(3000) Play the guitar (3000) play the guitar
(3000) Play the guitar

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Man, I keep having this re-occurring image where I'm
Standing on top of Church's Chicken playing guitar
Looked over and I see B.o.B. with this strange cigar
He's standing on top of Dunkin Donuts; it's like he own it
We at the corner of ""Give It To 'Em"" and ""They Don't Want It""
We out here somewhere in mid-Europe, they out here joning
My niggas threw out way too much jewelry, my chain lonely
But they don't know about black pearls, but I will show them
""Why the world sleeping on black girls?"" Hey I don't know, man
Silverback Stacks, jumping out the jungle
Blowing tiger stripe bubbles with ""Go To Hell"" bubblegum
When I was young, a space shuttle got hung in front of everyone
And grandmum tells me to stay humble but do not un-der-stand
One of these mumbles will make 'em throw up they arms and hands
Now stumble and they will know I put on my pants
One leg at a time, like they do, pay us no mind
But everybody look at why we do it, it take us more time
Excuse me if I'm no exhibitionist
According to the internet
3000 got a big old dic-tionary full of words
He must know how to use 'em
It also says I play the violin and that ain't true but
You give me six strings and a pick
And I will make a guitar talk, why, I ain't gotta say shit
And I encourage any child to pick up some instrument
Cuz if you're mad at your dad or mum, you can grab it and strum
Eat your cabbage and corn, by the time you're done
You will finally realize that they meant you no harm
They was trying to save your crazy ass from what's to come
3000 muthafucka ""Mr. Tell-Me-Somethin'""

[Outro: André 3000]
My partners say I should practice more, I know
They be saying I sound like I'm out of tune
I ask them: ""Do you cry in tune nigga? Do you laugh in tune?""

434,434,God Gave Me You,"[Verse 1]
I've been a walking heartache
I've made a mess of me
The person that I've been lately
Aren’t who I want to be

But you stay here right beside me
Watch as the storm blows through
And I need you

[Chorus]
Cause God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you

[Verse 2]
There's more here than what we’re seeing
A divine conspiracy
That you, an angel lovely
Could somehow fall for me
You'll always be love's great martyr
And I'll be the flattered fool
And I need you
Yeah!

[Chorus]
God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you

[Verse 3]
On my own I'm only
Half of what I could be
I can't do without you
We are stitched together
And what love has tethered
I pray we never undo

[Chorus]
Cause God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you, gave me you

Tell me, have you ever wanted someone so much it hurts?
Your lips keep trying to speak
But you just can't find the words
Well, I had this dream once
I held it in my head

[Verse 2]
She was the purest beauty
But not the common kind
She had a way about her
That made you feel alive
And for a moment
We made the world stand still

[Chorus]
Yeah, we owned the night

[Verse 3]
You had me dim the lights;
You danced just like a child
The wine spilled on your dress
And all you did was smile
Yeah, it was perfect
I hold it in my mind

[Chorus]
Yeah, we owned the night
Oh yeah

[Bridge]
When the summer rolls around
And the sun starts sinking down
I still remember you
Oh, I remember you
And I wonder where you are
Are you looking at those same stars again?
Do you remember when?

[Verse 4]
We woke under a blanket
All tangled up in skin
Not knowing in that moment
We'd never speak again
But it was perfect
I never will forget
When we owned the night

[Chorus]
Yeah, we owned the night
Yeah

Yeah, I put my shades on

[Verse 1]
I live it up like these are my last days
If time is money, I'm an hour past paid
Ugh, gunpowder in my hourglass
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag
Yeah, I put it down like my hands hurting
I'm on a natural high, but I land perfect
Some of us are lovers, most of y'all haters
But I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper
So love or hate me, I stay hate-free
They say we learn from mistakes; why, that's why they mistake me
I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers
All hail Weezy, call it bad weather
I stick to the script, I memorize the lines
Cause life is a movie that I've seen too many times
You're on the outside looking in, close the blinds
And they say never say never, but fuck it, nevermind
I've been gone too long, true or false, right or wrong
Hello Weezy, welcome home, yeah

[Chorus]
And I'm a blunt-blowin', Polo-drawers-showin'
I-don't-give-a-lovely-motherfuck-ass-nigga
With my money growing, no matter where you going
You don't need a bus pass for me to bust yo ass, nigga
I'm a blunt-blowin', Polo-drawers-showin'
I-don't-give-a-lovely-motherfuck-ass-nigga
With my money growing, no matter where you going
You don't need a bus pass for me to bust yo ass, nigga

[Verse 2]
Stunna, I got 'em, I'm back on them bitches
All about my riches, my name should be Richard
Cut the bullshit out, I'm Edward with the scissors
Life is a choice, and death is a decision
Times have changed, but fuck it get a new watch
I still got the vision like a line between two dots
Young Money's eating, the label getting fatter
And yea, the tables turned, but I'm still sitting at 'em
I'm a bad motherfucker cause the good die young
Everybody selling dreams, I'm too cheap to buy one
Man, when that cookie crumble, everybody want a crumb
Shoot that hummingbird down, hummingbird don't hum
Yea, big money, big money, deep pockets
Money talks, and motherfuckers eavesdropping
Bunch of bloods, you could call it blood clotting
Eastside, MOB Piru Damu

[Hook]
I'm a blunt-blowin', Polo-drawers-showin'
I-don't-give-a-lovely-motherfuck-ass-nigga
With my teeth glowing, I'm on my Deebowin'
You don't need a bus pass for me to bust yo ass, nigga

[Verse 3]
Light that Ashton Kutcher, I'm a limit pusher
See y'all dead meat, and me I'm just a butcher
I do it for the money, man I am such a hooker
And freedom was my girl, until they fucking took her
You can look into the future, it's right behind your eyelids
But I don't wanna know, cause shit I like surprises
Why that, why this, why you on that why shit?
Motherfucker ask me why, I say YM
Beach bum, call me Ocean Drive Slim
Drop the top, look up and make the sky grin
Young Mula, skinnies and some Supras
Belly of the beast 'til it puke us, motherfucker

Hey
Ayo, Sap! What's good, bruh?
This man is kinda high over here *Laughs*

[Verse 1]
Ayo, the flyest ma'fucker in the room, yeah, you know it's me
Bitches hatin' on him ‘cause he started out here locally
Hopefully I'll be at the top soon
For now I'm at my house on the couch watchin' cartoons
You know how much you love it when you get it in abundance
Give a fuck about a budget when you always be the subject of discussion
But it's nothin' when you stop and just say fuck it
‘Cause you walkin' out in public and you hear them talkin' rubbish
I just wanna ride, ride through the city in a Cutlass
Find a big butt bitch somewhere, get my nuts kissed
That's the way it goes when you party just like I do
Bitches on my dick that used to brush me off in high school

[Refrain]
Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?
Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit? (Hey)

[Chorus]
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
And they in awe, we gonna win, you can take the lose or draw
What I'm in got these hoes who used to play me in they bras
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
Take over the world, watch these haters get mad
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
Hop into the car and then we take 'em to the pad, it's a wrap

[Verse 2]
Uh, uh, uh
And ma'fuckers think they know me, but they never met the kid
Style come with excellence and money make benevolence
Irrelevant for the fuckers who never been intelligent
I kill my Henny, break the bottle for the hell of it
Tell a bitch that she better bring a friend
And if she want an autograph she better bring a pen
Yeah, the party never end, this life is what I recommend
And if you got a ho picked for me then she better be a 10
I ain't picky, but these girls be actin' tricky
When the situation's sticky and the liquor got 'em silly

[Refrain]
But I take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?

[Chorus]
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
And they in awe, we gonna win, you can take the lose or draw
What I'm in got these hoes who used to play me in they bras
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad

Push it up, push it up (let me see you just)

I got 'em shakin they boobies like congos
Man I'm shakin the city like quakes (yeahhh)
The haters blue in the face, like Gonzo
Cause I'm bakin a cake so let's bake (yeahhh)
I'm taking the game, the game's mine (mine)
Y'all witness the change, it's my time (time)
Y'all new to the game but y'all might wanna
Save ya whack raps, daylight saving time (time)
I can dance homey, I don't two-step
Y'all lookin at somethin like a true player
A girl told me that a man that could dance
Might could possibly get down with the tool in his pants
Now all my ladies let me see you vibrate
And when it's over you ain't gon' need ya vibrator
Cause I'm a pro, make you bend your back low
Then I pound it real fast just like the perculator

[Hook]

[V.I.V.]
Girl wobble it (yesss) and I'mma gobble it
I seen you movin your head, your head bobblin (hell yeahhh)
We can cradle the bed, I'm straight rackin it
The girls say my head like the head of a rocketship (ha ha~!)
God damn I'm so explicit
But I can't help it my flow ridiculous
Boy got a gift like it gotta be Christmas
Swag don't miss like he gotta be gifted
The girls brought cameras and they want pictures
And they gon' frame 'em, to see dat nigga
Led 'em to the bed while I'm sayin my scriptures
Cause I leave ya holy like you pray in the temple
Want beef? I move with the led of a pencil
And mine won't miss you, goodnight kiss you
Take it there and back, cause you got pistols
And I don't think Donnie Vick can run these issues

How they let me go and get a beat from kane
I swear these 808s & snares make me go insane
Aye hold up baby girl I really wanna know your name
And let me be your superman & you be Lois Lane
It's showtime like cable, get up on that table
I love your sexy body & I know you love this paper
Bottles coming like they got legs on 'em
The way I kill 'em man this beat will make 'em wanna call the feds on me

Pockets fat like they pregnant

Hah, get it, I'm so far ahead of my time

Party bus full of women
Like weed next to me
Woulda thought it was a gym the way we flexin'
Line full of sexy ladies tryna get with me
I'm just tryna grand slam like the boy Ken Griffy
And I'm at the bar nine shots no fifty
'Bout to bring a hundred more
Errybody get tipsy

444,444,Better Than I Know Myself,"[Verse 1]
Cold as ice
And more bitter than a December
Winter night
That's how I treated you
And I know that I
I sometimes tend to lose my temper
And I cross the line
Yeah, that's the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
I know it gets hard sometimes
But I could never
Leave your side
No matter what I say

[Chorus]
'Cause if I wanted to go, I would've gone by now
But I really need you near me to
Keep my mind off the edge
If I wanted to leave, I would've left by now
But you're the only one that knows me
Better than I know myself

[Verse 2]
All along
I tried to pretend it didn't matter
If I was alone
But deep down I know
If you were gone
For even a day, I wouldn't know which way to turn
'Cause I'm lost without you

[Pre-Chorus]
I know it gets hard sometimes
But I could never
Leave your side
No matter what I say

[Chorus]
'Cause if I wanted to go, I would've gone by now
But I really need you near me to
Keep my mind off the edge
If I wanted to leave, I would've left by now
But you're the only one that knows me
Better than I know myself

[Bridge]
I get kind of dark
Let it go too far
I can be obnoxious at times
But try and see my heart
'Cause I need you now
So don't let me down
You're the only thing in this world
I would die without

[Chorus]
'Cause if I wanted to go, I would've gone by now
But I really need you near me to
Keep my mind off the edge
If I wanted to leave, I would've left by now
But you're the only one that knows me
Better than I know myself
'Cause if I wanted to go, I would've gone by now
But I really need you near me to
Keep my mind off the edge
If I wanted to leave, I would've left by now

445,445,Drummer Boy,"[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Come they told me, pa rum pum pum pum
A newborn king to see, pa rum pum pum pum
Our finest gifts we bring, pa rum pum pum pum
To lay before the king, pa rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum pum
Yeah, I'm on the drum, yeah, I'm on the snare drum
Yeah, I'm on the beat 'cause the beat goes dumb
And I only spit heat 'cause I'm playing for the Son
Playing for the king, playing for the title
I'm surprised you didn't hear this in the Bible
I'm so tight I might go psycho
Christmas time, so here's a recital
I'm so bad like Michael, I know
I'm still young, but I go, I go
Stupid, stupid, love like Cupid
I'm the drummer boy, so do it, do it

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & (Busta Rhymes)]
Little baby, pa rum pum pum pum
I am a poor boy too, pa rum pum pum pum
(Let's gather 'round the mistletoe real quick)
I have no gifts to bring, pa rum pum pum pum
(Matter fact, let's gather 'round the fireplace, it's about to get hot in here)
Nothing to give our king (Bieber, what up?), pa rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum
(I needa get straight to it)

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Yo, at the table with the family, havin' dinner
BlackBerry on our hip and then it gave a little flicker
Then I took a look to see before it activates the ringer
Came to realize my homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter
Then I hit him back despite I had some food up on my fingers
Sippin' eggnog, with a little sprinkle of vanilla
Even though it's kinda cold, I'm pullin' out a chinchilla
Bieber hit me back and said ""Let's make it hot up in the winter"", I said ""Cool""
You know I'mma deliver
Let's collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger
Before we work, I gotta get this off
See the other family members and drop gifts off
Then I'm headed to the studio 'cause ain't nothing stopping how
You know we 'bout to turn it up and really get it popping now
People everywhere and all our Twitter followers
Merry Christmas, Kwanza, Happy Hanukkah

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Mary nodded, pa rum pa pum pum
The ox and lamb kept time, pa rum pa pum pum
I played my drum for him, pa rum pa pum pum
I played my best for him, pa rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum

[Verse 3: Justin Bieber]
If you wanna give, it's the time of year
JB on the beat, yeah, yeah, I'm on the snare
It's crazy how some people say they, say they don't care
When there's people on the street with no food, it's not fair
It's about time for you to act merrily
It's about time for you to give to charity
Rarely do people even wanna help at all
'Cause they're warm by the fire getting toys and their dolls
Not thinkin' there's a family out hungry and cold
Wishin', wishin' that they had somebody they could hold
So I think some of you need to act bold
Give a can to a drive, let's change the globe, globe, globe, globe, globe

[Outro: Justin Bieber]
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it

446,446,Nothing,"[Verse 1]
Am I better off dead? Am I better off a quitter?
They say I'm better off now than I ever was with her
As they take me to my local down the street
I'm smiling but I'm dying trying not to drag my feet

[Verse 2]
They say a few drinks will help me to forget her
But after one too many, I know that I'm never
Only they can't see where this is gonna end
They all think I'm crazy but to me it's perfect sense

[Chorus]
And my mates are all there trying to calm me down
'Cause I'm shouting your name all over the town
I'm swearing if I go there now
I can change her mind, turn it all around
And I know that I'm drunk but I'll say the words
And she'll listen this time even though they're slurred
So I dialed her number and confessed to her
I'm still in love but all I heard was nothing

[Verse 3]
So I stumble there, along the railings and the fences
I know if I faced her face, that she'll come to her senses
Every drunk step I take leads me to her door
If she sees how much I'm hurting, she'll take me back for sure

[Chorus]
And my mates are all there trying to calm me down
'Cause I'm shouting your name all over the town
I'm swearing if I go there now
I can change her mind, turn it all around
And I know that I'm drunk but I'll say the words
And she'll listen this time even though they're slurred
So I dialed her number and confessed to her
I'm still in love but all I heard was nothing

[Post-Chorus]
She said nothing
Oh, I wanted words but all I heard was nothing
Oh, I got nothing
I got nothing
Oh, I wanted words but all I heard was nothing

[Bridge]
Ohh, sometimes love's intoxicating
Ohh, you're coming down, your hands are shaking
When you realize there's no one waiting

[Interlude]
Am I better off dead? Am I better off a quitter?
They say I'm better off now than I ever was with her

[Chorus]
And my mates are all there trying to calm me down
'Cause I'm shouting your name all over the town
I'm swearing if I go there now
I can change her mind, turn it all around
And I know that I'm drunk but I'll say the words
And she'll listen this time even though they're slurred
So I dialed her number and confessed to her
I'm still in love but all I heard was nothing

[Post-Chorus]
She said nothing
Oh, I wanted words but all I heard was nothing
Oh, I got nothing
I got nothing
Oh, I wanted words but all I heard was nothing
Ohh I got nothing

[Outro]

447,447,Knock Knock,"[Intro]
Bum, ba bum
This is gonna feel real good, alright?
Most Dope
Everybody please put a thumb in the air (Hey, hey)

[Chorus]
One, two, three, four
Some crazy-ass kids gonna knock up on your door so
Let 'em in, let 'em in, let 'em in (Hey)
One, two, three, four
Some crazy-ass kids gonna knock up on your door so
Let 'em in, let 'em in, let 'em in (Hey!)

[Verse 1]
I feel like a million bucks
But my money don't really feel like I do
And from the ground, I built my own damn buzz
People was amazed I was still in high school
But now I'm out, and money what I'm 'bout
Trying to get so much that I can't keep count
New kicks give me cushion like whoopie
Keep a smile like an Eat'n Park cookie
Everything good, I'm white boy awesome
Up all night, Johnny Carson
I ain't got a Benz, no just a Honda
But try to get my money like an Anaconda
Real, real long cross the country
Smoke joints in the whip, no cop can bust me
Drive into the stage, they applaud and scream
All the pretty little girls come and flock with me
Yeah I rock the beat

[Chorus]
One, two, three, four
Some crazy-ass kids gonna knock up on your door so
Let 'em in, let 'em in, let 'em in (Hey!)
One, two, three, four
Some crazy-ass kids gonna knock up on your door so
Let 'em in, let 'em in, let 'em in (Hey!)

[Verse 2]
And I like my rhymes witty, all my dimes pretty
If you got weed, you can come fly with me
I don't take pity on them silly little hoes
Milli Vanilli but this is really how it goes
Mouth my words, don't say shit
Shh, shut up bitch and ride this dick
I'm just playing, let's have a ball
All we need is some weed, hoes and alcohol, hey
Don't forget it when I'm wreckin' the etiquette for the hell of it
Smellin' it when the L is lit and I'm flyer than a pelican
Young fresh but I'm so damn intelligent
Girls givin' brains 'cause I'm acting like a gentleman
In deeper than the water Michael Phelps was in
Finna have a party, baby, you can tell your friends
We the type, looking right, still settin' trends
Fuck a job, I'ma get these dead presidents

[Chorus]
One, two, three, four
Some crazy-ass kids gonna knock up on your door so
Let 'em in, let 'em in, let 'em in (Hey!)
One, two, three, four
Some crazy-ass kids gonna knock up on your door so
Let 'em in, let 'em in, let 'em in (Hey!)

[Bridge]
Not a day, goes by
When I ain’t gettin’ high
They wonder why
Don’t I
Go get myself a job so I can make, them bucks
But I don’t give a fuck, no I feel great
Bitch I feel great

[Chorus]
One, two, three, four
Some crazy-ass kids gonna knock up on your door so
Let 'em in, let 'em in, let 'em in (Hey!)
One, two, three, four
Some crazy-ass kids gonna knock up on your door so

448,448,Baggage Claim,"[Verse 1]
I have been dragging' around your sensitive ego
Making sure that your bags arrive on time for the dog and pony show
A little suitcase like a brick
It kinda makes it hard to get a good grip
I drop your troubles off at the conveyor belt
I'll hand you a ticket to go get it yourself

[Chorus]
At the baggage claim, you got a lot of luggage in your name
When you hit the ground, check the lost and found
Cause it ain't my problem now
I can't carry it on, I've got a lot of troubles on my own
It's all over the yard, in the trunk of the car
I'm packing' it in, so come and get it

[Verse 2]
If it ain't obvious what has set me off today
Behind every woman scorned is a man who made her that way
Go on and take your little business trip
With that sweet little habit that you can't kick
You better call your momma when you get to town
Cause I ain't gonna be hanging' around

[Chorus]
At the baggage claim, you got a lot of luggage in your name
When you hit the ground, check the lost and found
Cause it ain't my problem now
I can't carry it on, I've got a lot of troubles on my own
It's all over the yard, in the trunk of the car
I'm packing' it in, so come and get it

[Break]
Come and get it!

[Verse 3]
Come and pick it up, pick it up
Before I blow it up in flames
You better pick it up, pick it up
Baby, I'm leaving everything

[Chorus]
At the baggage claim, you got a lot of luggage in your name
When you hit the ground, check the lost and found
Cause it ain't my problem now
I can't carry it on, I've got a lot of troubles on my own
It's all over the yard, in the trunk of the car
I'm packing' it in, so come and get it
