0,0,Don't Forget About Us,"[Intro]
(Don't forget about us)
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
No baby, no baby, no baby, no
(Don't forget about us)
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
My baby boy

[Verse 1]
Just let it die with no goodbyes
Details don't matter, we both paid the price
Tears in my eyes
You know sometimes it'd be like that, baby

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now every time I see you, I pretend I'm fine
When I wanna reach out to you
But I turn and I walk and I let it ride
Baby, I must confess
We were bigger than anything
Remember us at our best
And don't forget about

[Chorus]
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

[Verse 2]
Oh, they say that you're in a new relationship
But we both know nothing comes close to
What we had, it perseveres
That we both can't forget it
How good we used to get it

[Pre-Chorus 2]
There's only one me and you
And how we used to shine (We used to shine)
No matter who you go through
We are one, that's a fact that you can't deny
So, baby, we just can't let the fire pass us by
Forever we'd both regret
So don't forget about

[Chorus]
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

[Bridge]
And if she's got your head all messed up now
That's the trickery
So why you act like you don't know how this loving used to be?
I bet she can't do it like me, she'll never be MC
Baby, don't you, don't you forget about us

[Chorus]
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you, babe
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

[Outro]
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
No baby, no baby, no baby, no
(Don't forget about us)
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
When it's for real, it's forever

And I keep tippin' you
While I sit back like a playa
And sip that grey goose
Feelin' all loose
Cause girl you on yo job
You got my dick hard
The way you touch them toes
Workin' them micros
On the stilletos
You made it skeet skeet skeet
Like a water hose (candy girl)
Got me goin' in my pocket pullin' out mo' dough
Let the waitress know I need to order, five hundred mo'
You best believe later on we headed to the mo'
So gone and pack them bags
And let's motherfuckin' go
I'm waitin' on yo fine ass
At the front do'

Toss it, flip it, and slap it
Bust a couple of nuts
And get right back at it

Nobody gonna love me better (mmh)

5,5,Photograph,"[Verse 1]
Look at this photograph
Every time I do, it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?
And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out
And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must've done it half a dozen times
I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I, I
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
(Goodbye)

[Verse 2]
Remember the old arcade?
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say somebody went and burned it down
We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel
Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, God, I, I
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

[Bridge]
I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it
If I could, I'd relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

[Chorus]
Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

[Outro]

[Intro: Jamie Foxx]
She take my money when I'm in need
Yeah, she's a triflin' friend indeed
Oh, she's a gold digger
Way over town that digs on me

[Hook: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said: ""I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls, you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm""
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her

[Hook: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Eighteen years, eighteen years
She got one of your kids, got you for eighteen years
I know somebody payin' child support for one of his kids
His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money
She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Shoulda got that insured, Geico for your money
If you ain't no punk
Holla, ""We want prenup! We want prenup!"" (Yeah!)
It's somethin' that you need to have
‘Cause when she leave yo' ass, she gon' leave with half
Eighteen years, eighteen years
And on the 18th birthday, he found out it wasn't his?

[Hook: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Now, I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke, but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat, he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it to a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries
So stick by his side
I know there's dudes ballin', and yeah, that's nice
And they gonna keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl
And when you get on, he'll leave yo' ass for a white girl

[Hook: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

8,8,Because Of You,"[Verse 1]
I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

[Chorus 1]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you, I am afraid

[Verse 2]
I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with

[Chorus 1]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust
Not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

[Bridge]
I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing

[Chorus 2]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I try my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid

[Outro]

11,11,One Wish,"Can I talk to you for a minute?

You know, I be thinking to myself
We had a lot of good times together (Come on, baby, come on darlin', darlin')
We did everything together

Yeah, we would wake up early in the morning (All I need, all I need, all I need is a chance to make it right)
And just get in the car and just ride on out (Just one chance)
Remember that? (All I need, all I need, is just one wish)
Use to watch the sunrise
(One wish, one wish)

Use to watch the sunset (All I need, all I need, all I need is a chance to make it right)
We was everything to each other, you know? (Just one chance)
(All I need, all I need, is just one wish)
Damn, I miss those days
(One wish, one wish, one wish)

(All I need, all I need, all I need is a chance to make it right)
If I could, if I could just hold you in my arms, you know what I mean? (All I need, all I need, is just one wish, one wish)
It just feels so good
(One wish)
One little, itty, bitty wish
If I could just have one wish

[Intro]
Damn baby..
Just don't understand where we went wrong
I gave you my heart
I gave you my soul
I gave you...

[Verse 1]
As a matter of fact I was the one who said I love you first
It was about eight years ago, don't act like you don't know
We were sittin' at home in your mama's livin' room
Cause, we couldn't be alone
See your mama knew I was something else, she knew how I felt
Back then we were in school and that's your favorite excuse
Growin' up I was a fool and I can't lie I'm missing you
Listen and don't trip
I think I need a bottle with a genie in it
Here's my wish list

[Hook]
First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'll make you my whole life
And you'll be my wife, make it right this time

If I had one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish

[Verse 2]
Now tell me is this the only way I can get you right back in
If so then searchin' I'll go, then I can have you for sho
Then you'll be loving me, holding me, kissing me
So girl don't tell me what I'm feeling is make believe
I swear if I lose a second chance with you
I wouldn't know what to do
I'll probably check myself into some kind of clinic
I couldn't be alone because without you I'm sick
Here's my wish list

[Hook]
First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'll make you my whole life
And you'll be my wife, make it right this time
If I had one wish

[Bridge]
I don't even know how we ended upon this road
And, even though we are grown, Girl I just want you to know

[Hook]
If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you

12,12,Stay Fly,"[Intro: DJ Paul]
Yeah!
For the 1st time it's going down, history baby
New Three 6 Mafia, featuring Eightball and MJG, Young Buck
It's a Tennessee thing

[Chorus: Juicy J]
I gotta stay fly-y-y-y, y-y, y-y, y
Til I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie
I gotta stay fly-y-y-y, y-y, y-y, y
Till I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie
I gotta stay fly-y-y-y, y-y, y-y, y
Til I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie
I gotta stay fly-y-y-y, y-y, y-y, y
Till I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
They call me the Juice and you know I'ma stunt
Riding in the car with some bump in the trunk
Tone in my lap and you know it's a pump
Breaking down the good green, rolling the blunt
Ghetto pimp type, girls say I'm the man
Ice on the wrist with the ice in the chain
Riding through the hood, got me gripping the grain
And I'm sipping the same, while I'm changing the lane
Eyes real tight cause I'm choking the green
Vision messed up, 'cause I'm drinking the lean
Messing with a D-Boy, riding them big toys
Make your main gal wanna get on my team
She gotta give it up before she get in my car
I ain't Denzel, but I know I'm a star
Cause when I'm in the club, I be back in the fog
In the V.I.P. part & be buying the bar

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
DJ Paul is a dog, one you do not trust
You leave your green around me, nigga your green gonna get lit up
You leave your drank around me, believe your drank gonna get drunk up
You leave your girl around me, if she bad she gonna get stuck
These niggas is spies, we live them lives and  keep them eyes tight
Riding 'round what they like
Make a couple nuns, a couple of dykes
So purple, purple, purple & swallow it down with
The yurple, yurple, yurple, it's going down

[Chorus: Juicy J]
I gotta stay fly-y-y-y, y-y, y-y, y
Til I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie
I gotta stay fly-y-y-y, y-y, y-y, y
Till I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie

[Verse 3: Young Buck]
Puff, puff pass, nigga roll that blunt
Let's get high nigga smoke us one
Paul pulled out the Phantom, niggas can't stand it
But them hoes gonna come out
Just really wanna smoke my weed
Fuck these hoes and stack my g's
Stop at the light and pause on Three
Hit the mall and it be all on me, but
Gotta keep one eye up on the po-po
Close the window, when I roll the indo
Know they mad cause I'm rolling Benzo
This that purple, not pretendo
Three 6 Mafia, them my kinfolks
So when I'm in Memphis, Tennekee
I just might not bring my own 'cause them niggas there let me smoke for free

[Verse 4: Crunchy Black]
What's up Mary, how you doing
Mary Jane, stalking me
Since I have met you, girl, you ruled my brain
You stole my heart, right from the start
So I broke you down, let momma put you in the 'gar

[Chorus: Juicy J]
I gotta stay fly-y-y-y, y-y, y-y, y
Til I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie
I gotta stay fly-y-y-y, y-y, y-y, y
Till I die-ie-ie-ie, ie-ie, ie-ie, ie

[Verse 5: 8Ball]
Premro, full of that dro
Leave the club full of Rose' Mo
Your girlfriend wanna ride with me
In a car with a pimp, where she supposed to be
You ain't met no dude spit it cold as me
The bag of kush cost 650
Have a nigga who smoke Reggie Miller
Coughing and choking constantly
Taste like fruit when you hit it
Gotta have bread to get it
Smoke all night, sleep all day
That's the epitome of the American way
Roll that shit, light that shit, hit that shit, hold that shit
Blow that shit out slow, then pass it to me bro

[Verse 6: MJG]
MJ finna sprinkle in some of that
Super incredible, have a nigga running back
Where that nigga with the hood sticky number at
Cutting up a cigarillo like a lumber jack
In the morning, when I need this and breath again a whole lot of weed, but
I'm needing somebody to give me what I need
When I want nothing less then the best of the trees
DJ Paul and Juicy J
8Ball and MJG
And Young Buck, we don't give a fuck, we must represent this Tennessee
We drink a whole lot of Hennessy
Nigga got a lil' hair on his chest
Do me like Bill Clinton girl, take it out your mouth
We'll shoot it right down on your dress

13,13,Soul Survivor,"[Intro: Akon & Young Jeezy]
Konvict (chea)
Akon and Young Jeezy (aye, aye)
Tryin' to take it easy (chea)
Only way to go (you already know what it is, nigga)
And so (aye, let's get it!)

[Hook: Akon]
If you lookin' for me I'll be on the block
With my thang cocked, possibly sittin' on a drop now
Because I'm a rider (yeah)
I'm just a soul survivor (yeah)
'Cause everybody know the game don't stop
Tryin' to make it to the top 'fore your ass get popped now
If you a rider (yeah) or just a soul survivor

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
Tonight I can't sleep, we livin' in Hell
First they give us the work, then they throw us in jail
Road-trip ya, I'm traffickin' the white
Please Lord, don't let me go to jail tonight
Who me? I'm a soul survivor
Ax about 'em in the street, the boy Jeez a rider
A hundred grand on my wrist, yeah, life sucks
Fuck the club, dawg, I rather count a million bucks

[Hook: Akon]
If you lookin' for me I'll be on the block
With my thang cocked, possibly sittin' on a drop now
Because I'm a rider (yeah)
I'm just a soul survivor (yeah)
'Cause everybody know the game don't stop
Tryin' to make it to the top 'fore your ass get popped now
If you a rider (yeah) or just a soul survivor

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
Another day, another dollar
Same block, same nigga, same part, same green
I guess we got the same dreams
Or is it the same nightmares?
We let the doves do it for us, we don't cry tears
Real niggas don't budge
When Mel Man got his time he shot birds at the judge
I'm knee-deep in the game
So when it's time to re-up, I'm knee deep in the cane
Real talk, look, I'm tellin' you, mayne
If you get jammed up, don't mention my name
Forgive me, Lord, I know I ain't livin' right
Gotta feed the block, niggas starvin', they got appetites
And this is e'ryday, it never gets old
Thought I was a juvenile stuck to the G-Code
This ain't a rap song, nigga, this is my life
And if the hood was a battlefield, then I'd earn stripes

[Hook: Akon]
If you lookin' for me I'll be on the block
With my thang cocked, possibly sittin' on a drop now
Because I'm a rider (yeah)
I'm just a soul survivor (yeah)
'Cause everybody know the game don't stop
Tryin' to make it to the top 'fore your ass get popped now
If you a rider (yeah) or just a soul survivor

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
Gotta watch ya e'ry move, 'cause them eyes be on you
Gotta drive real cool when them pies be on you
Just because we stack paper and we ball outrageous
Them alphabet boys got us under surveillance
Like animals, they lock us in cages
The same nigga that's a star when you put 'im on stages
I ain't cheat, played the hand I was dealt
Tried to tax the grand pearl when I got it myself
No nuts, no glory
My biography, you damn right, the true story
Set the city on fire, and I didn't even try
Run these streets all day, I can sleep when I die

[Bridge: Akon]
'Cause if you lookin' for me
You can find me on the block, disobeyin' the law
Real G, thoroughbred from the streets
Pants saggin' with my gun in my drawers
Just to keep on movin' now
Just to keep on movin' now
Just to keep on movin' now
Just to keep on movin' now, aye

[Hook: Akon]
If you lookin' for me I'll be on the block
With my thang cocked, possibly sittin' on a drop now
Because I'm a rider (yeah)
I'm just a soul survivor (yeah)
'Cause everybody know the game don't stop

Niggas fucking soft but them niggas wanna bite me
If you had 6 figures you'd be just like me
Yeah these niggas mad cause I'm shining like a light beam
Niggas talkin bout YEP in they mother fucking throw back
He ain't real you know that, Muhammad where they sold that
We stepping on these niggas like a mother fucking door mat
When I hit the scene they take pictures, call me Kodak
These ho's goin crazy, yeah I think they need some prozac
We the hottest thing on the market and you know that
Ya bitch chosed up an she don't wanna go back
We stacking big faces cause we still spendin all that

[JD]
When I do it, its something like the thriller in manilla man
Known as a killer man, fresh from the dealer man
So So niggas, ain't no crew illa than
10 acres of land and I got about a million
Dollars worth of cars in my front yard
I'm from the place in ATL where young niggas sling hard
Oh I think they like me when they heard me on the other one
So its only right that I hit you with another one
Remix, we gets busy over here, no sleep
Niggas stay up on their grizzy over here
We young (young), we fly (fly), we gonna stay flashy till the day that we die

[Hook: Dem Franchize Boyz]
Oh I think they like me
Oh I think they like oh I oh I think they like me

[Verse 2: Dem Franchize Boyz]
They don't wanna fight me
I'm snatchin ya ass up
First nigga act up, the first nigga get bust
Majestic getting shredded while I'm twirling and switching so
T-shirt stravaganza, (Franchise, dem white tee boyz)
Self made self paid
We lounge around in our white tee
Ashy black shirt well deep down to ya brown tee
My hundred throwback who sport a jersey by Ali
And if he make one, hell naw they dont psych me
I'm all about my cash ride around wit a nice piece
Ear piece ice piece they straight like me
You heard pimping player (yeah they shine so brightly)
Don't stand so close vision blurs when ice blings
Respect my whole squad no you can't even touch us cuz
Role out the red carpet high 5 and show us love
Carry barrettas count cheddar we trendsetters
I'm a franchize nigga have a mil or betta

[Da Brat]
Check it out, Six 0, six four four, six nine four
Blow 'dro with the windows up on deuce four's
? candy paint, brand new, think I ain't
Same chick, same clique, more bricks in the bank
Know now, no ho round, throw down like Brat
It ain't no showdown for no crown, I'm holding that (thats right)
They saw me on VH, pay great till this day
Been in love with the mic since Run-D.M.C. walked this way
I talk this way cause I'm gangsta a chi-town legend
I'm not ordinary people it's a star in your presence
I'm so icy that my earlobes hurt for what its worth
Don't test me I got the four fifth under the skirt
Thick in the the thighs can't touch that
Stay on my grind, I bust back if I must act and empty a stack
Its B to the R-A-T trust that I'm crazy, JD pays me, I'm such a fucking lady

[Bow Wow]
I'm Bow Weezy, prince of the O-town
Just got the wheels clean, so I'm riding slow now
I'm in a fast car, something like a NASCAR
If you wanna know how much it cost you should ask pa
As far as the watch and chain
I dropped some change, its easy for me to cop them things
And I don't stop, I got rocks and rings, you know
The same size as a boxing ring
Swimming pool in the front and the back yard
I ain't gotta act hard, I'm under 21 with a black card
And yea I know that was kind of a low blow
But the dough for the So So don't come slow

[Chorus: JD]
Oh I think they like me when they heard me on the other one
So its only right that I hit you with a (imitate record scratching)
Oh I think they like me when they heard me on the other one

15,15,When I'm Gone,"[Intro]
Yeah, it's my life
In my own words, I guess

[Verse 1]
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart and you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
""Daddy, look what I made!"" ""Dad's gotta go catch a plane""
""Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?""
""I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writin' a song, this song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself""
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

[Verse 2]
I keep havin' this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screamin' she don't want me to sing
""You're makin' Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?""
""Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more"" ""Daddy, you're lyin'!
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leavin' no more, Daddy, you're mine!""
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door, tryna block it
""Daddy, please! Daddy, don't leave! Daddy, no, stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it with ya!""
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man, I can hear 'em
They're sayin', ""You got one more chance to do right and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late!""
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and this spotlight is on and I'm singin'

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

[Verse 3]
Sixty-thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow, and thank you all for comin' out
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
""Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!""
But baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
""I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin
I get the point, fine, me and Mommy are goin'.""
But baby, wait! – ""It's too late, Dad, you made the choice
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep
Screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah, I bet you you will
You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real.""
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream, ""Die, Shady!"" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was
Supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles, and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

Got me doin' things I'll never do

[Verse 1]
She got me doin' the dishes
Anything she want for some kisses
I'm cookin' for her when she gets hungry
All she doin' is actin' like she want me
She cuttin' off all my homies
Even all my other ronis
She ain't even my main lady
See I been thinkin' bout it lately
Man she really don't deserve me
All she wanna do is hurt me
So I gotta get away from her
But now I'm leaving quickly
Before she come and try to get me
And I'm takin' everything with me
Well it all come down to her

Do do do, do do

[Verse 2]
So we went our separate ways
It's been a couple of days
But now I'm doin' what I want to
With nobody tellin' me what I'm gon' do
And I'm feelin' so free
With nobody but me
Now I can handle all my business
All of my fellas, can I get a witness?
But I'm feelin' kinda lonely
On top of that I'm kinda horny
And I gotta get back to her
Now I'm leavin' quickly
Before she come and try to get me
And I'm takin' everything with me
Well it all come down to her

[Chorus]
I'm sprung
Dawg, she got me
Got me doin' things I'll never do

Chemistry was crazy from the get go
Neither one of us knew why
We didn’t build nothin’ overnight
Cause a love like this takes some time
People swore it off as a phase, said we can’t see that
Now from top to bottom, they see that we did that
(Yes) It’s so true that
(Yes) We been through it
(Yes) We got real shit
(Yes) See baby we've been...

[Chorus]
Too strong for too long
And I can’t be without you baby
And I’ll be waitin’ up until you get home
Cause I can’t sleep without you baby (Ooh)
If anybody who’s ever loved, you know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothin’ can replace it
Call the radio if you just can’t be without your baby

[Verse 2]
I got a question for ya (See I already know the answer)
Still I wanna ask you will you lie? (No)

Do somethin’ behind my back and then try to cover it up
Well neither would I, baby

Good or bad (Thick or thin)
Right or wrong (All day, every day, hey)
Now if you’re down on love or don’t believe this ain’t for you (No, this ain’t for you)
And if you got it deep in your heart
And deep down you know that it’s true (C’mon, c’mon, c’mon)
Well let me see you put your hands up (Hands up)
Fellas tell your lady she’s the one
Fellas tell your lady she’s the one

Look him right in his eyes and tell him

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you

Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
No time to hesitate
Those who run seem to have all the fun
I'm caught up
I don't know what to do

The lights are on, but there's no one home
Tick tick tock, it's a quarter to two

I'm hanging up on you
I can't keep on waiting for you
I know that you're still hesitating
Don't cry for me, 'cause I'll find my way
You'll wake up one day
But it'll be too late

Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you

Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you

Waiting for you call, waiting for you call

Am I more than you bargained for yet?
I've been dying to tell you anything you want to hear
'Cause that's just who I am this week
Lie in the grass, next to the mausoleum

(Notch in your bedpost but you're just a line in a song)

Drop a heart, break a name
We're always sleeping in and sleeping for the wrong team

We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

[Verse 2]
Is this more than you bargained for yet?
Oh, don't mind me, I'm watching you two from the closet
Wishing to be the friction in your jeans
Isn't it messed up how I'm just dying to be him?

My life is brilliant

[Verse 1]
My life is brilliant, my love is pure
I saw an angel, of that I'm sure
She smiled at me on the subway
She was with another man
But I won't lose no sleep on that
'Cause I've got a plan

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face, in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

Yeah, she caught my eye, as we walked on by
She could see from my face that I was, fucking high
And I don't think that I'll see her again
But we shared a moment that will last 'til the end

You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face, in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do

We're so rich in love, we're rollin, in cashmere
Got it in fifth gear, baby
Diamond in the rough, is lookin' so sparkly

Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get to lay back (This is how we roll)
Trying so hard, saving up the paper
Now we get to lay back (Luxurious)
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback (Baby, we are so... ex-pen-sive ...oh)
The payback, the payback, oh

Mmm, mmm, yeah
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do-do
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Gotta change my answering machine
Now that I'm alone
'Cause right now it says that we
Can't come to the phone
And I know it makes no sense
'Cause you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore
(It's ridiculous)
It's been months
And for some reason I just (can't get over us)
And I'm stronger than this (enough is enough)
No more walking round
With my head down
I'm so over being blue
Crying over you

[Hook]
And I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

[Verse 2]
Gotta fix that calendar I have
That's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you
There's no more anniversary
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
And your memory
And how every song reminds me
Of what used to be
That's the reason

[Hook]
I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

[Bridge]
(Leave me alone)
Leave me alone
(Stupid love songs)
Don't make me think about her smile
Or having my first child
I'm letting go
Turning off the radio

[Hook]
'Cause I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing she were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
(why can't I turn off the radio?)
And I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing she were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
(why can't I turn off the radio?)
And I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

Let me know that I've done wrong
When I've known this all along
I go around a time or two
Just to waste my time with you
Tell me all that you've thrown away
Find out games you don't wanna play
You are the only one that needs to know

I'll keep you my dirty little secret (Dirty little secret)
Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret
(Just another regret, hope that you can keep it)
My dirty little secret

When we live such fragile lives

You are the only one that needs to know

[Intro]
Wake up Mr. West - Mr. West - Mr. West...
Uh, yea, uh, yea, uh, yea

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
And I heard 'em say, nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
From the Chi, like Tim it's a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise of the minimum wage?
And I know that the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allāhu Akbar and throw in some hot cars
Things we see on the screen that's not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars - I know it

[Hook: Kanye West & Adam Levine]
Uh, and I heard 'em say (Ooh), nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today (Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today)
But we'll a find a way
And nothing last forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
They say people in your life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And Gran keep praying and keep believing
In Jesus, and one day that you see him
'Til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin
Claiming money is the key, so keep on dreamin
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down
So now my little cousin smokin' them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out, I'm sick of it now

[Hook: Kanye West & Adam Levine]
Uh, and I heard 'em say (Ooh), nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today (Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today)
But we'll a find a way
And nothing last forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way

[Post-Hook: Adam Levine]
With every worthless word we get more far away
And nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way
Oohh, Oohh, Oohh, Oohh

28,28,You And Me,"[Verse 1]
What day is it? And in what month?
This clock never seemed so alive
I can't keep up and I can't back down
I've been losing so much time

[Chorus]
'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to lose
And it's you and me and all other people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you

[Verse 2]
All of the things that I want to say just aren't coming out right
I'm tripping on words
You've got my head spinning
I don't know where to go from here

[Chorus]
'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to prove
And it's you and me and all other people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you

[Bridge]
There's something about you now
I can't quite figure out
Everything she does is beautiful
Everything she does is right

[Chorus]
'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
Nothing to lose
And it's you and me and all other people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you
And me and all other people with nothing to do
Nothing to prove
And it's you and me and all other people
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you

[Verse 1: 2-D]
City's breaking down on a camel's back
They'll just have to go, 'cause they don't know wack
So all you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
You won't get undercounted 'cause you're damned and free
You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they come a kissin' 'cause I don't get sleep, no
*Beep*

[Chorus: 2-D]
Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all there on your stride
It is aching, falling down
Love forever, love is free
Let’s turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

Linin' 'em up like ass cracks

Watch me as I gravitate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

With yo' sound, you in the blink
Gon' bite the dust, can't fight with us

30,30,"Jesus, Take The Wheel","[Verse 1]
She was driving last Friday on the way to Cincinnati
On a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her Mama and her Daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was running low on faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was going way too fast
Before she knew it, she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

[Chorus]
Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel

[Verse 2]
It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said, ""I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight""

[Chorus]
Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Oh, Jesus, take the wheel

[Bridge]
Oh, I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
From this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel

[Outro]

She wet, that's a carpool
Been in that water since a young'n, you just shark food
Quick Draw McGraw, I went to art school
Yeah the lights is bright, but I got a short fuse, don't snooze
Been handling the game so long my thumbs bruised
Your new girlfriend is old news
You ain't got enough green and she so blue
Cash Money Records, where dreams come true
Everything is easy, baby, leave it up to Weezy Baby
Put it in the pot, let it steam, let it brew
Now watch me melt; don't burn yourself, 'cause –

Still sleeping on me but I'm 'bout to wake 'em, yep

It's hot down here, take a walk with Satan, yeah
Come on mama, let the Carter make ya
Toss you like a fruit salad, strawberry-grape ya
They ball when they can, and I'm ballin' by nature
Addicted to the game, like Jordan and Payton
Y'all in the race, and me, I'm at the finish line
Been running for too long, it's time to give me mine
Straight down your chimney, in your living room, it's I

Seven years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends

[Chorus]
Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

[Verse 2]
Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Ring out the bells again
Like we did when spring began
Wake me up when September ends

[Chorus]
Here comes the rain again
Falling from the stars
Drenched in my pain again
Becoming who we are
As my memory rests
But never forgets what I lost
Wake me up when September ends

[Verse 3]
Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Like my father's come to pass
Twenty years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends

33,33,I Should Have Cheated,"[Verse 1]
Baby
First of all let me say
You can't accuse me of all the things you know that you are guilty of
And I see
That it is easy for you to blame everything on me
If that's the case
I should go have my fun and do all the things you say I do
Boy I can't
Continue to take this from you

[Hook]
I might as well have cheated on you
As much as you accused me of cheating
I might as well have lied to you
As much as you accused me of lying
I might as well have gone to the club
As much as you accused me of clubbin'
I might as well have threw away my love
As much as you accused me
I should have cheated

[Verse 2]
You say I was out
With somebody else when my girl told me she saw you with some girl
But I didn't
Accuse you of something that I didn't see myself
Realize
That I would never do anything to disrespect you
Trust me
You gotta stop accusing me

[Hook]
I might as well have cheated on you
As much as you accused me of cheating
I might as well have lied to you
As much as you accused me of lying
I might as well have gone to the club
As much as you accused me of clubbin'
I might as well have threw away my love
As much as you accused me

[Bridge]
Don't you know I wish I knew that you would treat me this way
If you don't promise me that you've changed your ways, I'm leaving today
And I ain't coming back
And you made it like that
Was unfair to me
All this jealousy
I'm your everything
What will you do without me?
Why you trippin'?

[Hook]
I might as well have cheated on you
As much as you accused me of cheating
I might as well have lied to you
As much as you accused me of lying
I might as well have gone to the club
As much as you accused me of clubbin'
I might as well have threw away my love
I should have gave it all away
As much as you accused me
I should have cheated

[Verse 3]
I should have lied, I should have cheated
Maybe I should have went out to the club
Or maybe I, I should have done it
I should have given away all my love
Or maybe I, I should have played you
'Cause you don't appreciate me, no
And I tried to stay down with you
But your making it hard on me

[Hook]
I might as well have cheated on you
As much as you accused me of cheating
I might as well have lied to you
As much as you accused me of lying
I might as well have gone to the club
'Cause I love you
As much as you accused me of clubbin'
I might as well have threw away my love
As much as you accused me
I should have cheated
As much as you accused me of cheating
I should have cheated
As much as you accused me of lying
As much as you accused me of clubing
I love you
As much as you accused me of cheating
I should have cheated
I should have cheated
I should have cheated
I should have cheated
I should have cheated
I should have cheated","['baby', 'first', 'of', 'all', 'let', 'me', 'say', 'you', 'cant', 'accuse', 'me', 'of', 'all', 'the', 'things', 'you', 'know', 'that', 'you', 'be', 'guilty', 'of', 'and', 'i', 'see', 'that', 'it', 'be', 'easy', 'for', 'you', 'to', 'blame', 'everything', 'on', 'me', 'if', 'thats', 'the', 'case', 'i', 'should', 'go', 'have', 'my', 'fun', 'and', 'do', 'all', 'the', 'things', 'you', 'say', 'i', 'do', 'boy', 'i', 'cant', 'continue', 'to', 'take', 'this', 'from', 'you', 'i', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'cheat', 'on', 'you', 'as', 'much', 'as', 'you', 'accuse', 'me', 'of', 'cheat', 'i', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'lie', 'to', 'you', 'as', 'much', 'as', 'you', 'accuse', 'me', 'of', 'lie', 'i', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'go', 'to', 'the', 'club', 'as', 'much', 'as', 'you', 'accuse', 'me', 'of', 'clubbin', 'i', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'throw', 'away', 'my', 'love', 'as', 'much', 'as', 'you', 'accuse', 'me', 'i', 'should', 'have', 'cheat', 'you', 'say', 'i', 'be', 'out', 'with', 'somebody', 'else', 'when', 'my', 'girl', 'tell', 'me', 'she', 'saw', 'you', 'with', 'some', 'girl', 'but', 'i', 'didnt', 'accuse', 'you', 'of', 'something', 'that', 'i', 'didnt', 'see', 'myself', 'realize', 'that', 'i', 'would', 'never', 'do', 'anything', 'to', 'disrespect', 'you', 'trust', 'me', 'you', 'gotta', 'stop', 'accuse', 'me', 'i', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'cheat', 'on', 'you', 'as', 'much', 'as', 'you', 'accuse', 'me', 'of', 'cheat', 'i', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'lie', 'to', 'you', 'as', 'much', 'as', 'you', 'accuse', 'me', 'of', 'lie', 'i', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'go', 'to', 'the', 'club', 'as', 'much', 'as', 'you', 'accuse', 'me', 'of', 'clubbin', 'i', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'throw', 'away', 'my', 'love', 'as', 'much', 'as', 'you', 'accuse', 'me', 'dont', 'you', 'know', 'i', 'wish', 'i', 'know', 'that', 'you', 'would', 'treat', 'me', 'this', 'way', 'if', 'you', 'dont', 'promise', 'me', 'that', 'youve', 'change', 'your', 'ways', 'im', 'leave', 'today', 'and', 'i', 'aint', 'come', 'back', 'and', 'you', 'make', 'it', 'like', 'that', 'be', 'unfair', 'to', 'me', 'all', 'this', 'jealousy', 'im', 'your', 'everything', 'what', 'will', 'you', 'do', 'without', 'me', 'why', 'you', 'trippin', 'i', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'cheat', 'on', 'you', 'as', 'much', 'as', 'you', 'accuse', 'me', 'of', 'cheat', 'i', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'lie', 'to', 'you', 'as', 'much', 'as', 'you', 'accuse', 'me', 'of', 'lie', 'i', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'go', 'to', 'the', 'club', 'as', 'much', 'as', 'you', 'accuse', 'me', 'of', 'clubbin', 'i', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'throw', 'away', 'my', 'love', 'i', 'should', 'have', 'give', 'it', 'all', 'away', 'as', 'much', 'as', 'you', 'accuse', 'me', 'i', 'should', 'have', 'cheat', 'i', 'should', 'have', 'lie', 'i', 'should', 'have', 'cheat', 'maybe', 'i', 'should', 'have', 'go', 'out', 'to', 'the', 'club', 'or', 'maybe', 'i', 'i', 'should', 'have', 'do', 'it', 'i', 'should', 'have', 'give', 'away', 'all', 'my', 'love', 'or', 'maybe', 'i', 'i', 'should', 'have', 'play', 'you', 'cause', 'you', 'dont', 'appreciate', 'me', 'no', 'and', 'i', 'try', 'to', 'stay', 'down', 'with', 'you', 'but', 'your', 'make', 'it', 'hard', 'on', 'me', 'i', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'cheat', 'on', 'you', 'as', 'much', 'as', 'you', 'accuse', 'me', 'of', 'cheat', 'i', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'lie', 'to', 'you', 'as', 'much', 'as', 'you', 'accuse', 'me', 'of', 'lie', 'i', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'go', 'to', 'the', 'club', 'cause', 'i', 'love', 'you', 'as', 'much', 'as', 'you', 'accuse', 'me', 'of', 'clubbin', 'i', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'throw', 'away', 'my', 'love', 'as', 'much', 'as', 'you', 'accuse', 'me', 'i', 'should', 'have', 'cheat', 'as', 'much', 'as', 'you', 'accuse', 'me', 'of', 'cheat', 'i', 'should', 'have', 'cheat', 'as', 'much', 'as', 'you', 'accuse', 'me', 'of', 'lie', 'as', 'much', 'as', 'you', 'accuse', 'me', 'of', 'club', 'i', 'love', 'you', 'as', 'much', 'as', 'you', 'accuse', 'me', 'of', 'cheat', 'i', 'should', 'have', 'cheat', 'i', 'should', 'have', 'cheat', 'i', 'should', 'have', 'cheat', 'i', 'should', 'have', 'cheat', 'i', 'should', 'have', 'cheat', 'i', 'should', 'have', 'cheat']",573,Keyshia Cole,Keyshia Cole,2005,"[34, 31, 30, 38, 35, 34, 36, 35, 35, 38, 49, 72, 85]",13,I Should Have Cheated,https://open.spotify.com/track/5tFDgH6do20IXdSoNBAmXK,5tFDgH6do20IXdSoNBAmXK,spotify:track:5tFDgH6do20IXdSoNBAmXK,The Way It Is,4zEAsP0RIfbGARdtsgAaUV,spotify:album:4zEAsP0RIfbGARdtsgAaUV,Keyshia Cole,1vfezMIyCr4XUdYRaKIKi3,spotify:artist:1vfezMIyCr4XUdYRaKIKi3,327.69300000000004,12.0,55.0,2005-01-01,0.436,0.5329999999999999,2.0,-4.266,0.0,0.0472,0.265,0.0,0.332,0.366,130.768,"['dance pop', 'deep pop r&b', 'hip pop', 'neo soul', 'pop', 'pop rap', 'r&b', 'rap', 'urban contemporary']",[],1.0

Time and time again, I gotta turn back round and tell these hoes
That I am the H-N-I-C,  bitch that's just the way it goes
I be on that shit that'll have you on that ""I don't want no mo'""
At this time, I need all my freak hoes to get down on the flo'
If you came to rep your set, right now nigga, let 'em know
If it's jail I get for stompin' a hater to sleep, fuck it, I go
Freak, I'll be off in the wheep
Straight geeked swerving down your street
In a stolen Bonneville with 23's on the feet
The Legend, Rocky D Brown, back in town to plea you down
Give me face, I love the sound
Slap the taste, they hit the ground
Back in the A
Cliqued up, picked up with some people that don't play
On that Kryptonite stay
So high, we might fly awwwaaayyy

[Chorus: Rock-D]

Get dope on a daily basis
Get high, make them ugly faces
Toke the 'dro, and I'm on probation
My blunts I don't be lacing

Come to my crib tonight
Let me beat that puss all night
Run tell your buddies I fucked you right
Tell 'em bout all the plaques on the wall
Tell 'em how you licked my balls
Tell 'em how Konkrete run the streets
Big Boi, he put us on

Suppose the po-po's get whiff of the spliff that you just smoked, them folks gon' trip
Probable cause, call the canine unit to the side of the road, let's take a sniff (Arf, arf!)
Shit, the only thing we ridin' dirty is this UGK CD, Tackleberry
So may we be on our merry way?
Cuz you just ain't gon find no yay

Make a judge lean like he sipping syrupy
They play dur-ty, he cain't touch me
Verdict be not guilty, search me

Where I come from isn't all that great
My automobile is a piece of crap
My fashion sense is a little whack
And my friends are just as screwy as me
I didn't go to boarding schools
Preppy girls never looked at me
Why should they? I ain't nobody
Got nothing in my pocket

Look at all those movie stars
They're all so beautiful and clean
When the housemaids scrub the floors
They get the spaces in between
I wanna live a life like that
I wanna be just like a king
Take my picture by the pool
Cause I'm the next big thing

Turn it up some
Alright boys, this is her favorite song
You know that right
So, if we play it good and loud
She might get up and dance again
Ohh, she put her beer down
Here she comes
Here she comes
Left, left, left right left
Whoo

[Verse 1]
Hustlers shootin' eight ball
Throwin' darts at the wall
Feelin' damn near ten feet tall
Here she comes, Lord help us all
Ol' T.W.'s girlfriend done slapped him out his chair
Poor ole boy, it ain't his fault
It's so hard not to stare

[Chorus]
At that honky tonk badonkadonk
Keepin' perfect rhythm, make ya wanna swing along
Got it goin' on like Donkey Kong
And whoo-wee, shut my mouth, slap your grandma
There oughta be a law, get the Sheriff on the phone
Lord have mercy, how'd she even get them britches on
That honky tonk badonkadonk
(Aww son)

[Verse 2]
Now Honey, you can't blame her
For what her mama gave her
It ain't right to hate her
For workin' that money-maker
Band shuts down at two
But we're hangin' out till three
We hate to see her go
But love to watch her leave

[Chorus]
With that honky tonk badonkadonk
Keepin' perfect rhythm
Make ya wanna swing along
Got it goin' on like Donkey Kong
And whoo-wee shut my mouth, slap your grandma
There oughta be a law, get the Sheriff on the phone
Lord have mercy, how'd she even get them britches on
With that honky tonk badonkadonk
(Ooh, that's what I'm talkin' bout right there, honey)

[Bridge]
We don't care about the drinkin'
Barely listen to the band
Our hands, they start a shakin'
When she gets the urge to dance
Drivin' everybody crazy
You think you fell in love
Boys, you better keep your distance
You can look but you can't touch

[Chorus]
That honkey tonk badonkadonk
Keepin' perfect rhythm
Make ya wanna swing along
Got it goin' on like Donkey Kong
And whoo-wee, shut my mouth, slap your grandma
There oughta be a law, get the Sheriff on the phone
Lord have mercy, how'd she even get them britches on

Yeah, that honky tonk badonkadonk

A woman is mystery
A man just can't understand
Sometimes all it takes to please her
Is the touch of your hand
And other times you got to take it slow
And hold her all night long
Heaven knows there's so many ways
A man can go wrong

Must be doing something right

You leaned into my kiss
And closed those deep blue need you eyes
Don't know what I did
To earn a love like this, but baby, I

Anywhere you want to go
Baby, show me the way
I'm open to suggestions
Mmm, whatever you say
Tonight's about giving you
What you want, whatever it takes
Girl, I hope I'm on the right road
And judging by the smile on your face

Of everything that stands between us

Let it wash all the hurt away

I feel like laying you down

If there's still a chance
Then take my hand
And we'll steal away
Off into the night
'till we make things right
The suns gonna rise on a better day

Come a little closer baby
I feel like stripping it down
Back to the basics of you and me
And what makes the world go round
Every inch of you against my skin
I wanna be stronger than we've ever been

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Everybody just
Everybody just bounce, bounce
Check it out
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Everybody just
Everybody just bounce, bounce

[Chorus]
(I gotta shake you off)
'Cause the loving ain't the same and you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
(I gotta shake, shake you off)
Just like the Calgon commercial, I
Really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere
(I gotta shake you off)
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give
Boy, I gotta (Shake, shake you off)
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby, and that means I gotta
(Shake you off)

[Verse 1]
By the time you get this message, it's gonna be too late
So don't bother paging me 'cause I'll be on my way
See, I grabbed all my diamonds and clothes
Just ask your momma she knows
You're gonna miss me, baby
Hate to say I told you so
Well, at first I didn't know, but now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks and lie compulsively
So I packed up my Louis Vuitton
Jumped in your ride and took off
You'll never ever find a girl who loves you more than me

[Chorus]
(I gotta shake you off)
'Cause the loving ain't the same and you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
(I gotta shake, shake you off)

Really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere

Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it off
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it off

[Verse 2]
I found out about a gang of your dirty little deeds
With this one and that one by the pool
On the beach, in the streets
Heard y'all was
Hold up my phone's breakin' up
I'mma hang up and call the machine right back
I gotta get this off of my mind
You wasn't worth my time
So I'm leaving you behind
Yeah, 'cause I need a real love in my life
Save this recording because
I'm never coming back home
Baby, I'm gone, don't ya know?

[Chorus]
(I gotta shake you off)
'Cause the loving ain't the same and you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay

Pull out some old school Marvin Gaye and put it on repeat
Now shorty come in, show me you can take it boo

Show me what you can do
(Come and fuck me reverse now, girl)
Doing things that'll get you gone, when we on the couch I can make you moan
Eat you up when we in the kitchen, let you get on top when we by the stove

Took her to the bedroom, about to make her an Overnight Celebrity
I finna get up in the sack and I hope you ready for me girl
Finna hit it from the back, while I'm bumpin' ""Ready for the World""
I want you to hold me, while I'm kissin' all over ya body slowly
Give it to you like a O.G, in and out
In, out, show me how you work them walls
Up, down, show me how you work them jaws
And in the bed when the faucet run, you will catch that drain
That's why I love gettin' freaky with you 'cause you's a nasty thang
Shorty, please, let's ride
In, out, show me how you work them walls
Up, down

You know I rep the dirty dirty where they move cane
You know we mix purple stuff in that blue drank

You know I'm V.I.P. (You know I'm V.I.P.)
And since you rollin' with a star (You rollin' with a star)
You V.I.P. with me. (Chamillitary hey hey)

Chamillionaire
Chamillitary the biggest threat to any of these rapper thinkin' they doin' it
Who That Is? That's dem boyz from Texas that always do it big
Multi-colored diamonds got us shinin' They say our jewelry sick
Houston got a problem and you don't want nothin' to do wit it
Do you kid? I ain't think so I'm tippin' slow
Wen my trunk is liftin' up look at the neons as they glow
Groupies never givin' up they be everywhere I go
When that elevator go up to my suite they there fo' sho'
Told me that she didn't care about my money Wasn't hearin' it
Looks can be decevin' as Chamillion paint apperances
You know how we do it at home of Screw and purple syrup is
She got turned out quicker than my power steering did

Chorus: Chamillionaire
I'm a show you how to get your shine on
Turn It Up the DJ playin' my song
Everybody keep on callin' my phone
Which one of y'all am I gon' take home?
I'm a show 'em how to get the club crunk
Give 'em something that's gon' rattle that trunk
Tip your cups up until you get drunk
Tell the DJ to play it loud and turn the beat up","['chamillionaire', 'yeah', 'its', 'the', 'name', 'they', 'say', 'be', 'runnin', 'the', 'game', 'chamilitary', 'remain', 'lil', 'flip', 'lil', 'flip',

43,43,Tequila Makes Her Clothes Fall Off,"[Verse 1]
She said, ""I'm going out with my girlfriends
Margaritas at the Holiday Inn""
Oh, have mercy, my only thought
Was tequila makes her clothes fall off

[Verse 2]
I told her put an extra layer on
I know what happens when she drinks Patrón
Her closet's missing half the things she bought
Yeah, tequila makes her clothes fall off

[Chorus]
She'll start by kicking out of her shoes
Lose an earring in her drink
Leave her jacket in the bathroom stall
Drop a contact down the sink

[Verse 3]
Them pantyhose ain't gonna last too long
If the DJ puts Bon Jovi on
She might come home in a tablecloth
Yeah, tequila makes her clothes fall off
Whoa

[Verse 4]
She can handle any champagne brunch
A bridal shower with Bacardi punch
Jello shooters full of Smirnoff
But tequila makes her clothes fall off

[Chorus]
She'll start by kicking out of her shoes
Lose an earring in her drink
Leave her jacket in the bathroom stall
Drop a contact down the sink

[Outro]
She don't mean nothing
She's just having fun
Tomorrow she'll say, ""Oh, what have I done?""
Her friends will joke about the stuff she lost
Yeah, Tequila makes her clothes fall off
Oh, Tequila makes her clothes fall off

Let me talk to y'all and just, you know
Give you a little situation... listen (Fellas)

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes & The Pussycat Dolls]
You see this shit get hot, every time I come through
When I step up in the spot (Are you ready?)
Make the place sizzle like a summertime cookout
Prowl for the best chick, yes, I'm on the lookout (Let's dance)
Slow bangin' shorty like a belly dancer with it
Smell good, pretty skin, so gangsta with it (Ooh, baby)
No tricks, only diamonds under my sleeve
Gimme the number, but make sure you call before you leave

And in the back of your mind
I know you should be fuckin' with me (Ahh)

[Chorus: The Pussycat Dolls]
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me?
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me?
Don't cha? Don't cha?

[Verse 3: The Pussycat Dolls & Cee-Lo Green]
Fight the feeling (Fight the feeling)
Leave it alone (Leave it alone)
'Cause if it ain't love
It just ain't enough to leave a happy home (Uh-uh, uh-uh)

You have to play fair (You have to play fair, yeah)
See, I don't care
But I know, she ain't gon' wanna share (Ah, ah-ah)

[Chorus: The Pussycat Dolls & Busta Rhymes]

[Verse 4: Busta Rhymes]
Well, let me get straight to it
Every broad wanna watch a nigga when I come through it
It's the God almighty, lookin' all brand new
If shorty wanna jump in my Aston Vanquish
Lookin' at me all like she really wanna do it
Tryna put it on me 'til my balls black and blueish
You wanna play with a player, girl, then play on
Strip out the Chanel and leave the lingerie on (Ha)
Watch me and I'mma watch you at the same time
Lookin' at you wanna break my back
You're the very reason why I keep a pack of the Magnum
And with the wagon, hit you in the back of the Magnum
For the record, don't think it was something you did
Shorty all on me 'cause it's hard to resist the kid
I got a idea that's dope for y'all
As y'all could get cold so I could hit the both of y'all

[Verse 5: The Pussycat Dolls & Cee-Lo Green]
See, I know she loves ya (I know she loves ya)

I'd probably be just as crazy about you if you were my own man
Maybe next lifetime (Maybe next lifetime)

45,45,Window Shopper,"[Intro]
Ohh!
The top feel so much better than the bottom
So much better

[Chorus]
Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the jewelry store lookin' at shit you can't buy
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the dealership tryin' to get a test drive
Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by

[Verse 1]
Summertime, white Porsche Carrera is milky
I'm on the grind, let my paper stack but I'm filthy
It's funny how niggas get to screw-facin' at me
Anyhow they ain't got the heart to get at me
I'll get down, Southside's the hood that I come from
So I don't cruise through nobody hood without my gun
They know the kid ain't gon' fall for all that bullshit
Try and stick me, I'ma let off a full clip
It ain't my fault you done fucked up your re-up
At the dice game, who told you put a G up?
Everybody mad when they paper don't stack right
But when I come around y'all niggas better act right
When we got the tops down, you can hear the systems thump
Nigga, when we rollin', rollin', rollin'
Shut your block down, quick to put a hole in a chump
Nigga, when we rollin', rollin', rollin'

[Chorus]
Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the jewelry store lookin' at shit you can't buy
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the dealership tryin' to get a test drive
Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by

[Verse 2]
Niggas love me in L.A. as soon as I pop in
They come to scoop me up at LAX and I hop in
Now when it comes to bad bitches you know I got them
Some from Long Beach, some from Watts and from Compton
You know a nigga wanna see how Cali girls freak off
After that five hour flight from New York
I start spittin' G at a bitch like a pimp, mane
Tell her, ""Meet me at the Mondrian so we can do our thang.""
She can bring the lingerie with her, I sup-pose
Then we can go from fully dressed to just havin' no clothes
Then she can run and tell her best friend 'bout my sex game
Then her best friend could potentially be next, mane
Listen mane, shit changed, I came up, I'm doin' my thang
Homie, I'm holdin', holdin', holdin'
Oh shit, mane, the store owner watchin' you
Before somethin' get stolen, stolen, stolen

[Chorus]
Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the jewelry store lookin' at shit you can't buy
Nigga, you's a window shopper

Yeah ladies I know you tired of the same old thing

I got a strategy--we bout to heat it up

Girl, all because you let me get unpredictable

[Verse 1]
Baby 1 plus 1 ain't 2 when you with me
C ain't after A and B when you with me
It don't make sense right now but it will
Later on when you see how I make you feel
Regular ain't in my vocabulary
When it comes to love makin', neither is missionary
Positions: girl pick one...better yet some
Never mind that we tryin' all of 'em!

Why not be my dinner, while makin' a movie?
Do you get it get it

See what I got over a lot of fellas is that I'm more creative
And soon you will see what I mean, what I mean

Nevertheless, always the more
From the pool table to the kitchen floor
Next stop's the G spot... Luda!
(I like that!)

Let me put a little bit of excite-ment
Up in yo lifestyle
You gotta know that time's of the essence
I'm talkin' right now
I can get, get rid of that headache
What you doin' tonight?
Some say that sex is overrated, but they just ain't doin' it right
I keeps it interesting baby just take them clothes off
I'll be your Tylenol just take me till you doze off
Wake you up in the middle of the night and take you to another world
You'll wake up in the mornin' feeling like another girl

Candy yams and chitllins', Grandma's home made baked biscuits
The land of classical Caprices and Impalas, and super sports
Ingredients in this peach cobbler called (""Georgia"")
I love the women out in LA and the shoppin' stores in NEW YORK!

The same shape as Florida; Lookin' for me boy
You'll find me down in Dougherty County in a small city called Albany (""Georgia"")
Where they used to call us some Bamas, and now they

But ya hustlers wasn't on ever corner like the Waffle House in Atlanta

Now you might come from vacation, leave on probation, Home of the strip club

For the thick chick in the thong wit the big butt, Wanna get love

49,49,We Belong Together,"[Intro]
Ooh, oh oh
Sweet love, yeah

[Verse 1]
I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so
I should have held on tight, I never should have let you go
I didn't know nothing, I was stupid
I was foolish, I was lying to myself
I couldn’t have fathomed I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself
'Cause I didn’t know you, 'cause I didn’t know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The feeling that I’m feeling now that I don’t hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips ‘cause I don’t have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn’t give to have you lying by my side
Right here, ’cause baby

[Chorus]
When you left, I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
‘Cause we belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough?
Who’s gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up?
Who’s gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together

[Verse 2]
I can't sleep at night, when you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Singing to me, ""If you think you're lonely now""
Wait a minute, this is too deep (Too deep)
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial tryin' to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
""I only think of you""
And it's breaking my heart
I'm tryna keep it together, but I'm falling apart

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm feeling all out of my element
Throwing things, cryin' tryin'
To figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby

[Chorus]
When you left, I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
‘Cause we belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough?
Who’s gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up?
Who’s gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together

[Outro]
Baby, when you left, I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
‘Cause we belong together
Who am I gonna lean on when times get rough?
Who’s gonna talk to me 'til the sun comes up?
Who’s gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together","['ooh', 'oh', 'oh', 'sweet', 'love', 'yeah', 'i', 'didnt', 'mean', 'it', 'when', 'i', 'say', 'i', 'didnt', 'love', 'you', 'so', 'i', 'should', 'have', 'hold', 'on', 'tight', 'i', 'never', 'should', 'have', 'let', 'you', 'go', 'i', 'didnt', 'know', 'nothing', 'i', 'be', 'stupid', 'i', 'be', 'foolish', 'i', 'be', 'lie', 'to', 'myself', 'i', 'couldn’t', 'have', 'fathom', 'i', 'would', 'ever', 'be', 'without', 'your', 'love', 'never', 'imagine', 'id', 'be', 'sit', 'here', 'beside', 'myself', 'cause', 'i', 'didn’t', 'know', 'you', 'cause', 'i', 'didn’t', 'know', 'me', 'but', 'i', 'think', 'i', 'know', 'everything', 'i', 'never', 'felt', 'the', 'feel', 'that', 'i’m', 'feel', 'now', 'that', 'i', 'don’t', 'hear', 'your', 'voice', 'or', 'have', 'your', 'touch', 'and', 'kiss', 'your', 'lips', '‘cause', 'i', 'don’t', 'have', 'a', 'choice', 'oh', 'what', 'i', 'wouldn’t', 'give', 'to', 'have', 'you', 'lie', 'by', 'my', 'side', 'right', 'here', '’cause', 'baby', 'when', 'you', 'leave', 'i', 'lose', 'a', 'part', 'of', 'me', 'its', 'still', 'so', 'hard', 'to', 'believe', 'come', 'back', 'baby', 'please', '‘cause', 'we', 'belong', 'together', 'who', 'else', 'be', 'i', 'gonna', 'lean', 'on', 'when', 'time', 'get', 'rough', 'who’s', 'gonna', 'talk', 'to', 'me', 'on', 'the', 'phone', 'til', 'the', 'sun', 'come', 'up', 'who’s', 'gonna', 'take', 'your', 'place', 'there', 'aint', 'nobody', 'better', 'oh', 'baby', 'baby', 'we', 'belong', 'together', 'i', 'cant', 'sleep', 'at', 'night', 'when', 'you', 'be', 'on', 'my', 'mind', 'bobby', 'womacks', 'on', 'the', 'radio', 'sing', 'to', 'me', 'if', 'you', 'think', 'youre', 'lonely', 'now', 'i', 'gotta', 'change', 'the', 'station', 'so', 'i', 'turn', 'the', 'dial', 'tryin', 'to', 'catch', 'a', 'break', 'and', 'then', 'i', 'hear', 'babyface', 'i', 'only', 'think', 'of', 'you', 'and', 'its', 'break', 'my', 'heart', 'im', 'tryna', 'keep', 'it', 'together', 'but', 'im', 'fall', 'apart', 'im', 'feel', 'all', 'out', 'of', 'my', 'element', 'throw', 'things', 'cryin', 'tryin', 'to', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'the', 'hell', 'i', 'go', 'wrong', 'the', 'pain', 'reflect', 'in', 'this', 'song', 'aint', 'even', 'half', 'of', 'what', 'im', 'feel', 'inside', 'i', 'need', 'you', 'need', 'you', 'back', 'in', 'my', 'life', 'baby', 'when', 'you', 'leave', 'i', 'lose', 'a', 'part', 'of', 'me', 'its', 'still', 'so', 'hard', 'to', 'believe', 'come', 'back', 'baby', 'please', '‘cause', 'we', 'belong', 'together', 'who', 'else', 'be', 'i', 'gonna', 'lean', 'on', 'when', 'time', 'get', 'rough', 'who’s', 'gonna', 'talk', 'to', 'me', 'on', 'the', 'phone', 'til', 'the', 'sun', 'come', 'up', 'who’s', 'gonna', 'take', 'your', 'place', 'there', 'aint', 'nobody', 'better', 'oh', 'baby', 'baby', 'we', 'belong', 'together', 'baby', 'when', 'you', 'leave', 'i', 'lose', 'a', 'part', 'of', 'me', 'its', 'still', 'so', 'hard', 'to', 'believe', 'come', 'back', 'baby', 'please', '‘cause', 'we', 'belong', 'together', 'who', 'be', 'i', 'gonna', 'lean', 'on', 'when', 'time', 'get', 'rough', 'who’s', 'gonna', 'talk', 'to', 'me', 'til', 'the', 'sun', 'come', 'up', 'who’s', 'gonna', 'take', 'your', 'place', 'there', 'aint', 'nobody', 'better', 'oh', 'baby', 'baby', 'we', 'belong', 'together']",417,Mariah Carey,Mariah Carey,2005,"[50, 49, 49, 40, 33, 31, 26, 22, 18, 15, 12, 9, 6, 5, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 7, 12, 30, 61, 81]",38,We Belong Together,https://open.spotify.com/track/3LmvfNUQtglbTrydsdIqFU,3LmvfNUQtglbTrydsdIqFU,spotify:track:3LmvfNUQtglbTrydsdIqFU,The Emancipation of Mimi,43iBTEWECK7hSnE0p6GgNo,spotify:album:43iBTEWECK7hSnE0p6GgNo,Mariah Carey,4iHNK0tOyZPYnBU7nGAgpQ,spotify:artist:4iHNK0tOyZPYnBU7nGAgpQ,201.4,14.0,69.0,2005-01-01,0.8370000000000001,0.462,0.0,-7.89,1.0,0.0601,0.0339,0.0,0.09,0.762,139.986,"['dance pop', 'pop', 'r&b', 'urban contemporary']",[],1.0

I am unwritten, can't read my mind
I'm undefined
I'm just beginning, the pen's in my hand
Ending unplanned

[Pre-Chorus]
Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you cannot find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

[Chorus]
Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten, yeah
Oh, oh

I break tradition
Sometimes my tries, are outside the lines, yeah
We've been conditioned to not make mistakes
But I can't live that way, no, oh

51,51,Shake That,"[Intro: Eminem & Nate Dogg]
Whoo! Shady, Aftermath
(Look at that bitch!)
(Holy shit, hey!)
There she go, shakin' that ass on the flo'
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losin' control

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunk, get fucked up
Hit the strip club, don't forget ones, get your dick rubbed
Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit-faceted
Pasted, plastered – puke, drink, throw up
Get a new drink, hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine goin'
Still got a few chunks on them shoestrings showin'
I was dehydrated 'til the beat vibrated
I was revived as soon as this bitch gyrated
Them hips and licked them lips, and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg here to sing some shit

[Verse 2: Nate Dogg]
Two to the one, from the one to the three
I like good pussy and I like good tree
Smoke so much weed, you wouldn't believe
And I get mo' ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one, from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me:
Conversation and Hennessy
I've been to the motherfuckin' mountaintop
Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass I'm gon' continue to rock
Get your ass off the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy, just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie

[Bridge: Nate Dogg]
We 'bout to have a party (Turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go 'head and shake your butt)
I'm lookin' fo' a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin', baby? Step right up
Some girls, they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm lookin' fo' a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say, every day she be givin' it up

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
(Now) Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride rin-inse
Swish, but don't spit it; swallow it and now finish
Yeah, me and Nate D-O Double-G
Lookin' for a couple bitches with some double D's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's
Slip it in her bubbly, we finna, finna

[Bridge 2: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
We 'bout have a party (Turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go 'head and shake your butt)
I'm lookin' fo' a girl I can fuck in my Hummer truck
Apple Bottom jeans and a big ol' butt
Some girls, they act retarded (Man, I told you!)
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I want a bitch to sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can, but she won't say no

[Verse 4: Nate Dogg with Eminem]
(Now) Look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be
Tonight I want a slut, would you be mine?
Heard you was freaky from a friend of mine
Now, I hope you don't get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak
He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind
I told him how you like it from behind

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
(Now) Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on, girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me

[Bridge: Nate Dogg]
We 'bout to have a party (Turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go 'head and shake your butt)

[Outro: Nate Dogg & Eminem]
There she go, shakin' that ass on the flo'
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losin' control
God!
I ain't leavin' without you, bitch!
Comin' home with me!
And my boy, and his boy – and his boy, and his girl

52,52,Like We Never Loved At All,"[Verse 1: Faith Hill]
You never looked so good
As you did last night
Underneath the city lights
There walking with your friend
Laughing at the moon
I swear you looked right through me
But I'm still living with your goodbye
And you're just going on with your life

[Chorus: Faith Hill & Tim McGraw]
How can you just walk on by
Without one tear in your eye?
Don't you have the slightest feelings left for me?
Maybe that's just your way
Of dealing with the pain
Forgetting everything between our rise and fall
Like we never loved at all

[Verse 2: Faith Hill & (Tim McGraw), Both]
You, I hear you're doing fine
Seems like you're doing well
As far as I can tell
Time (time) is leaving us behind (leaving us behind)
Another week has passed
And still I haven't laughed yet
So tell me what your secret is
(I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know)
To letting go, letting go like you did, like you did

[Chorus: Faith Hill & Tim McGraw]
How can you just walk on by
Without one tear in your eye?
Don't you have the slightest feelings left for me?
Maybe that's just your way
Of dealing with the pain
Forgetting everything between our rise and fall
Ooh, like we never loved at all

[Bridge: Faith Hill & (Tim McGraw), Both]
Did you forget the magic?
Did you forget the passion? (Passion)
Did you ever miss me
Ever long to kiss me?
Oh, oh baby, baby (Oh, baby)

[Chorus: Faith Hill & Tim McGraw]
Maybe that's just your way
Of dealing with the pain

53,53,She Let Herself Go,"[Verse 1]
He wondered how she'd take it when he said goodbye
Thought she might do some crying, lose some sleep at night
But he had no idea when he hit the road
That without him in her life, she'd let herself go

[Chorus]
Let herself go on a singles cruise
To Vegas once, then to Honolulu
Let herself go to New York City
A week at the Spa; came back knocked-out pretty
When he said he didn't love her no more
She let herself go

[Verse 2]
She poured her heart and soul into their three-bedroom ranch
Spent her days raisin' babies, ironing his pants
Came home one day from the grocery store and found his note
And without him there to stop her, she let herself go

[Chorus]
Let herself go on her first blind date
Had the time of her life with some friends at the lake
Let herself go buy a brand new car
Drove it down to the beach he always said was too far
Sand sure felt good between her toes

[Chorus]
She let herself go on a singles cruise
To Vegas once, then to Honolulu
Let herself go to New York City
A week at the Spa; came back knocked-out pretty
When he said he didn't love her no more
She let herself go

Sunny days seem to hurt the most
I wear the pain like a heavy coat
I feel you everywhere I go
I see your smile, I see your face
I hear you laughing in the rain
I still can't believe you're gone

[Chorus]
It ain't fair: you died too young
Like the story that had just begun
But death tore the pages all away
God knows how I miss you
All the hell that I've been through
Just knowing no-one could take your place
An' sometimes I wonder
Who'd you be today?

[Verse 2]
Would you see the world? Would you chase your dreams?
Settle down with a family
I wonder what would you name your babies?
Some days the sky's so blue
I feel like I can talk to you
An' I know it might sound crazy

[Chorus]
It ain't fair: you died too young
Like the story that had just begun
But death tore the pages all away
God knows how I miss you
All the hell that I've been through
Just knowing no-one could take your place
An' sometimes I wonder
Who'd you be today?

And you ask me what I want this year
And I try to make this kind and clear
Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days

And designer love and empty things

And something only you can give
And that's faith and trust and peace while we're alive
And the one poor child who saved this world
And there's 10 million more who probably could
If we all just stopped and said a prayer for them

So take these words
And sing out loud

'Cause tonight's the night the world begins again

I feel no shame, I'm proud of where I came from
I was born and raised in the boondocks
One thing I know, no matter where I go
I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks

[Verse 1]
I can feel that
Muddy water runnin' through my veins
And I can hear that
Lullaby of the midnight train
And it sings to me and sounds familiar

[Chorus]
I feel no shame, I'm proud of where I came from
I was born and raised in the boondocks
One thing I know, no matter where I go
I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks

[Verse 2]
I can taste that honeysuckle
And it's still so sweet
When it grows wild
On the banks down at old Camp Creek
Yeah, and it calls to me like a warm wind blowin'

[Chorus]
I feel no shame, I'm proud of where I came from
I was born and raised in the boondocks
One thing I know, no matter where I go
I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks

[Bridge 1]
It's where I learned about livin'
It's where I learned about love
It's where I learned about workin' hard
And havin' a little was just enough
It's where I learned about Jesus
And knowin' where I stand
You can take it or leave it
This is me, this is who I am

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge 2]
Give me a tin roof, a front porch and a gravel road
And that is home to me, feels like home to me

[Chorus]
I feel no shame, I'm proud of where I came from
I was born and raised in the boondocks
One thing I know, no matter where I go
I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks

58,58,Good Ride Cowboy,"[Verse 1]
From the hills to Kaycee, Wyoming
Where life's wooly and wild
Came an Air Force brat
In a cowboy hat
And that Copenhagen smile
And from bucking broncs
To honky tonks
He always sang a cowboy's song
We were much too young
Having too much fun
As we all sang along

[Chorus]
(And we sang) Life's a highway
There's only one way
You're gonna get through it
When she starts to twist
Be more like Chris
Pull your hat down tight
And just LeDoux it
When that whistle blows
And that crowd explodes
And them pickup men are at your side
They tell you good ride cowboy, good ride

[Verse 2]
From gold buckles to gold records
Well, once again he was spinning 'round
Took the whole world on
And he turned us on
To that Western Underground
And from ""Bareback Jack""
To ""This Cowboy's Hat""
The songs were stronger than his pain
He would not slow down
From town to town
Like children running through the rain

[Chorus]
(And we sang) Life's a highway
There's only one way
You're gonna get through it
When she starts to twist
Be more like Chris
Pull your hat down tight
And just LeDoux it
When that whistle blows
And that crowd explodes
And them pickup men are at your side
They tell you good ride cowboy, good ride

(And we sang) Life's a highway
There's only one way
You're gonna get through it
When she starts to twist
Be more like Chris
Pull your hat down tight
And just LeDoux it
When that whistle blows
And that crowd explodes
And them pickup men are at your side
They tell you good ride cowboy, good ride

[Outro]
I bet he crossed that river Jordan
With St. Peter on the other side
Singing good ride cowboy, good ride

I want to live where soul meets body
And let the sun wrap its arms around me
And bathe my skin in water, cool and cleansing and feel
Feel what it's like to be new
'Cause in my head there's a Greyhound station
Where I send my thoughts to far off destinations
So they may have a chance of finding a place
Where they're far more suited than here

[Verse 2]
Well, I cannot guess what we'll discover
When we turn the dirt with our palms cupped like shovels
But I know our filthy hands can wash one another's
And not one speck will remain

I do believe it's true
That there are roads left in both of our shoes
But if the silence takes you, then I hope it takes me too
So, brown eyes, I'll hold you near
'Cause you're the only song I want to hear
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere

60,60,Don't Bother,"[Verse 1]
She's got the kind of look that defies gravity
She's the greatest cook
And she's fat free (Fat free, fat free, fat free)
She's been to private school
And she speaks perfect French
She's got her perfect friends
Oh, isn't she cool?
She practices Tai Chi
She'd never lose her nerve
She's more than you deserve
She's just far better than me
Hey, hey

[Chorus]
So don't bother
I won't die of deception
I promise you won't ever see me cry
Don't feel sorry
And don't bother, I'll be fine
But she's waiting
The ring you gave to her will lose its shine
So don't bother, be unkind

[Verse 2]
I'm sure she doesn't know
How to touch you like I would
I beat her at that one good
Don't you think so?
She's almost six feet tall
She must think I'm a flea
I'm really a cat, you see
And it's not my last life at all
Hey, hey

[Chorus]
So don't bother
I won't die of deception
I promise you won't ever see me cry
Don't feel sorry
Don't bother, I'll be fine
But she's waiting
The ring you gave to her will lose its shine
So don't bother, be unkind

[Bridge]
For you, I'd give up all I own
And move to a communist country
If you came with me, of course
And I'd file my nails so they don't hurt you
And lose those pounds, learn about football
If it made you stay, but you won't, but you won't

[Chorus]
So don't bother
I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine
Promise you won't ever see me cry
And after all, I'm glad that I'm not your type
Promise you won't ever see me cry
Don't bother
I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine
Promise you won't ever see me cry

63,63,Nasty Girl,"[Intro: Jazze Pha & The Notorious B.I.G.]
The Biggie Duets! (Uhh!)
Jazzy Fizzle, Jagged Edge (Biggie Smalls)
Ladies and gentlemen!

[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]
I go on and on and on and
Don't take 'em to the crib unless they bonin
Easy, call 'em on the phone and
Platinum Chanel cologne and
I stay dressed to impress
Spark these bitches interest
Sex is all I expect
If they watch TV in the Lex, they know
They know, quarter past 4
Left the club tipsy, say no mo'
Except how I'm gettin home tomorrow
Cease will drop you off when he see his P.O
Back of my mind I hope she swallow
Man she spilled a drink on my cream Wallows
Reach the gate, hungry just ate
Riffin, she got to be to work by eight
This must mean she ain't tryna wait
Conversate, sex on the first date
I state, ""You know what you do to me""
She starts off, ""But I don't usually""
Then I whipped it out, rubber no doubt
Step out, show me what you all about
Fingers in your mouth, open up your blouse
Pull your G-string down South
I threw that back out, in the parking lot
By a Cherokee and a green drop-top
And I don't stop until I squirt
Jeans, skirt, butt-naked - it all work

[Hook: Jagged Edge]
Gotta love my lil' nasty girl
Know I love my lil' nasty girl

[Verse 2: Diddy]
You know I like nasty girls...
I need you to dance, I need you to strip
I need you to shake your lil' ass and hips
I need you to grind like you workin' for tips
And gimme what I need while we listen to Prince
Cause miss you ain't seen the world yet, rocked La Perla yet
Rocked them pearl sets, flew in a pearl jet
My style make a low profile girl smile
Blow a chick back like I blow through a trial (take that)
And now you and me can drink some Hennessy
Then we get it on
Made women wantin' to bone Sean Combs, sippin' on Patron
Speedin' be leanin' got 'em fiendin'
Then when I did it to you throw it right back (right back)
And tell me ""Yeah Diddy I like it like that"" (like that)
Lift your shirt, you know how I flirt
Heels & skirt let's take it off now let's work (LETS WORK!)

Listening to your twisted transistor
Hold it between your legs
Turn it up, turn it up
Low end is coming through
Can't get enough

A lonely life, where no one understands you
But don't give up, because the music do
Music do!
Music do!
Music do!
Music do!
Music do!
Music do!

Because the music do
And then it's reaching
Inside you, forever preaching
Fuck you, too
Your scream's a whisper
Hang on, you twisted transistor

Hey you, hey you, finally you get it
The world ain't fair, eat you if you let it
And as your tears fall on
Your dress, your dress
But when she's coming through
You're in a mess

A lonely life, where no one understands you
But don't give up, because the music do

Anesthetize this bitch
Anesthetize
Just let me be between you and me
Them things
Them things

Because the music do
And then it's reaching
Inside you, forever preaching

[Intro]
You know
Los capos están ready
Las mamis están ready
Y en la calle estamos ready
Yeah, yeah, andamos ready
Los barrios están ready
One, two, get ready, come on!
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

[Coro]
Rompe, rompe, rompe, bien guilla'o
Rompe, rompe, rompe, ese cuerpo ella lo—
Rompe, rompe, rompe, bien guilla'o
Are you ready!?

Rompe, rompe, rompe, break it down
Rompe, rompe, rompe, the way she moves, ella lo—
Rompe, rompe, rompe, break it down
Let's go!

[Verso 1]
My boo, no se limita a la hora de romper su pum-pum
Con curvas más calientes que el sur, right through
Enséñame si tienes la actitud, mami
Dale, go! Dale, go! Dale, go! Go!
Tiempo; llego el momento, baby, de perder el control
Trabájame ese cuerpo más que un shot de Winstrol
Sube ese temperamento, dame movimiento
Lento, lento, ella lo—

[Coro]
Rompe, rompe, rompe, bien guilla'o
Rompe, rompe, rompe, ese cuerpo ella lo—
Rompe, rompe, rompe, bien guilla'o
Are you ready!?

Rompe, rompe, rompe, break it down
Rompe, rompe, rompe, the way she moves, ella lo—
Rompe, rompe, rompe, break it down
G-Go! G-Go! G-Go! G-Go!

[Puente]
Voy chillin', tranquilo, that's right
Buscando una gata que cae
No escondas todo eso que traes
Yo, baby, ¿qué es la que hay?
Voy chillin', tranquilo, that's right
Buscando una gata que cae
No escondas todo eso que traes
¿Qué pasa, socio?, ¿qué es la que hay?
(What!? What!? What!? What!?)

[Verso 2]
Pinche, guey, pensaste que esto era un mamey
No vo'a dar break, deja ese guille de Scarface
Get out my way, usted no vende ni en eBay
No das pa' na', conmigo estás Frito-Lay
Chequea el swing, que se le pega a to'as las nenas más que un G-string
Yo soy la pesadilla de todos los dream team
Ya se te acabo el magazine
Conmigo no te la guilles, pa', de Listerine
Daddy te—

[Coro]
Rompe, rompe, rompe, bien guilla'o
Rompe, rompe, rompe, ese cuerpo ella lo—

67,67,Gotta Go,"[Intro (spoken)]
Good evening
I'd like to thank everybody for coming out
Hope your flights were safe
Feeling real breezy, swift like the wind

[Verse 1]
It's calling my body, yeah, it's calling my soul
It's calling my mind, girl I gotta go
Baby it's the grind, yes I had a good time
Don't get me wrong, you were so good and I really wish I could
Stay a little bit longer, love you a little bit stronger
And go a little deeper, baby with you
But since this thang is calling I gotta answer dry your eyes
Girl don't cry 'cause you're making it hard for me

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't want to leave, ooh girl but I gotta go right now
I'll be back to hold you down
I don't want to leave no but girl I gotta go right now
And I'll be back before you know it

[Verse 2]
So hold that thought, don't you move
See I'm coming right back, right back for you
Don't you change your position, girl I'm on a mission
And baby trust I'll be missing, missing you 'cause I don't wanna leave

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't want to leave, ooh girl but I gotta go right now
I'll be back to hold you down
I don't want to leave no but girl I gotta go right now
And I'll be back before you know it

[Bridge]
Streets be calling me, they be calling my name, baby
And when they call I gotta go, so I'm letting you know
I won't be gone for long
And already, I can't wait to come home to you

[Chorus]
I don't want to leave, no baby, but I gotta go right now
I'll be back to hold you down
I don't want to leave no but girl I gotta go right now
And I'll be back before you know it
I don't want to leave, no, but I gotta go right now
I'll be back to hold you down
I don't want to leave, but I gotta go right now
And I'll be back before you know it

[Interlude (spoken)]
Break it down, down, down
Nah, I don't wanna leave
But you know hit it is when-
Whoa, baby, keep that on
Don't take it off
Keep it on so I can take it off when I get back!
*laughs*
Yeah, fa'sho
You better believe that!

[Chorus]
I don't want to leave, no baby, but I gotta go right now
I'll be back to hold you down
I don't want to leave no but girl I gotta go right now
And I'll be back before you know it
I don't want to leave, no, but I gotta go right now
I'll be back to hold you down
I don't want to leave, but I gotta go right now

When you hear our favorite song
Miss me baby
And when you start to sing along
Think about all the times that we danced
In the light to it all night long, oh
Then miss me baby

And want me honey
Like you did the night you told me that you loved me
We couldn't wait anymore, left the keys in the door
Took my hand, pulled me down on the kitchen floor
Yeah, we were that crazy
Miss me baby

Because when he's holding you
Know that it's killing me
Let my memory be the reason girl
That you can't sleep
And every time you feel his touch
I pray to God it's not enough
And that I've touched your heart so deep
Girl you can't shake me
'Cause I love you, yes I need you
Miss me baby

Miss me baby
Until you can't take it no more
Miss me baby
Pack your bags and hit the door
I'm a man, I was wrong, forgive me
Come back home, I'll be waiting, right here waiting

Because when he's holding you
Know that it's killing me
Let my memory be the reason girl
That you can't sleep
And every time you feel his touch
I pray to God it's not enough
And that I've touched your heart so deep
Girl you can't shake me

D to the roc, my nigga Kaine
Up in the cut, pouring it up
Rolling it up, holding it up
Ain't her ass swollen or what?
Yes sir, yes sir
Oh we gonna take it back like thieves and foes
Nasty as I wanna be

Ho get down get low

All the lil mamas all around the world
Shake that ass if you a nasty girl
""Back That Azz Up,"" says Juvenile
Show a nigga some titties like girls gone wild
Take off, strip your clothes, I wanna see you in the nude
You can keep on your high heel shoes
So follow me down the yellow brick road
Where niggas go to see naked hoes
Shake that shit, bitch
And be off in the club with a hard ass dick
Then drop like this bitch
If you wanna make the money shawty work that shit
Put a hump in your back and lick it raw
To a 3 point stance, with yo flexible ass
You must be on that Kanye workout plan
Like head, shoulders, knees, hoes

And them hoes and the girl with the real tight clothes

So while we in the club betta get these girls

You're now tuned in to WUTP radio
We your host for tonight Cool and Dre
You're now locked in to the Juvenile hour
I know all y'all hot girls is tuned in right now
So we gon send this new one out to you clearly
It's called Rodeo talk to 'em pimpin'

[Juvenile]
Y'all need to open ya ears up and soak this game up
And if nobody don't know ya I'm a make y'all famous
This is 24-karats but it shine like stainless
Just look at how the diamonds complement my fingers (*choking*)
Yes indeed-shit chokin me woah I need a breath to breathe
Chasin with the Hennessy now that's how a G play it
Especially when them hoes shakin that ass to the DJ
If I could do it big give 'em some leeway
Security stop trippin and you niggas be easy
Yessir this the bubble right hurr
You're all beautiful women if you're insecure

[Hook]
Let me see ya work that-twerk that-serve that
Come on and do the rodeo
Let me see ya bounce that-move that-do that
Let me see ya do the rodeo
Let me see ya work that-twerk that-serve that
Come on and do the rodeo
Let me see ya bounce that-move that-do that
Let me see ya do the rodeo (rodeo show)

[Juvenile]
It's like you don't even have nothin on
Got everybody watchin you so you can show that thong
It's ya birthday lil' mama get ya kodak on
But don't quit showin the world you in the throwback zone
We ain't leavin right now we on a positive vibe
But I still keep the homicide squad on the side
See how I'm holdin on the steering wheel controllin' the ride
And y'all comin out of park because I got it in drive
I'm really feelin ya outfit it must be nice
A hard worker like myself could afford that price
I can't deny that you's a beautiful bitch
You got a face, and a ass, and a smile that want quit

[Hook]

[Juvenile]
We not judgin by size that's all statistics
Just turn the lights down and it's ballerific
This not the right spot to let ya daughters visit
It's some freaks up in here and it's all explicit
My round put me on ya just cause he want hit it
Shit I hope you don't be trippin on some 'be home'shit
Cause Jack ain't worried bout who Staci with
And he don't have to be puttin up with Staci's shit
I ain't lyin sometimes when you cross my path
Up in the club all night and niggas stalk yo ass

Big fine I ain't even trippin and I know you ain't trippin
Cause you know you wore that there tonight for me

72,72,Fresh Azimiz,"[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
When I was 8 I was rhymin not backyard game playin
Watchin Snoop anxiously and waitin for my chance man
Hot and cocky wit it cause I kno that I am man
I'm goin down in history like American Bandstand
I stay fresh to def like the neighborhood dope man
I stay on the top cause I keep comin wit dough man
You steady watchin stealin but there ain't no hope man
You dealin wit somethin bigger than the US Open
And ain't no jokin
Fresh like fatlaces and dukey ropes and I keep on smokin
Young but I'm ready so that means I'm strokin
Look at me now days girl a dawg is pokin
Addicted to it J.D. say I got it bad
18 nigga makin more than yo dad see
They think they doin it but I'mma out do 'em
If you know somebody like that pull up and say to 'em

[Hook: Bow Wow] + (J-Kwon)
Ye ain't ridin (ye ain't ridin)
Ye ain't bumpin like I'm bumpin
Ye ain't sayin nuthin homie
Ye ain't fresh azimiz
Ye ain't got it (ye ain't got it)
You don't keep it Doug E. like I keep it Doug E
Lil buddy you ain't fresh azimiz

[J-Kwon]
Ye ain't big (big) whippin
Ye ain't steady tip tippin
No girl gettin homie

Think ye iz (think ye iz)
But cha ain't (but cha ain't)
Think you can get it crunk like me but you can't

[Verse 2: Bow Wow]
Now every record that I make I'm tryin to get up out the store man
Every car I drive I'm tryin have you sayin whoa man
Fourth album comeback power like rogaine
Records say Columbia but I'm So So man
I stay on my grind bringin in that dough man
From records to movies now a TV show man
Anything given to me I'm gon rep man
Big house, big cars what you expect man
Just to get a glimpse girls breakin they neck man
Blinded by the light glistenin off the Breitling
Bow hot as ever I ain't lost no step
Straight t-shirt, sneakers I ain't tryin to go prep
Like these lil r 'n' b groups that need my help
Wish they had my style wish they had my rep
But oh no, you'll never have it like me man
And if you can't understand this is what I'm sayin

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bow Wow]
I got a spot in M-I-A to get away from the cold weather
Talk around town as if I'm wit Ciara
Bow fall off nigga that'll be never
I'm rich (yea I'm rich) I can do whatever
I get a kick outta shuttin suckas down in the parkin lot
Especially when they tryin to stunt thinking they hot
All out the window talking loud like they runnin my block
That's when I come through (come through) and all that stop
And ain't another younger keep it fresh like dis man
Every year, same time come wit them hits man
Tired of makin girls fall out wit a kiss man
Well listen and you're stuck music just like quicksand
Older people say that lil young dude sick man
Young A.I. and we crew thick man
Difference between me and you is you be bricklin
And I ain't never ever done that before (no)

[Bow Wow]
Ye ain't ridin (ye ain't ridin)
Ye ain't bumpin like I'm bumpin
Ye ain't sayin nuthin homie
Ye ain't fresh azimiz
Ye ain't got it (ye ain't got it)

525,000 moments so dear

How do you measure, measure a year?

In daylights, in sunsets, in midnights, in cups of coffee
In inches, in miles, in laughter, in strife
In 525,600 minutes
How do you measure a year in the life?

How about love?
How about love?
How about love?
Measure in love

In bridges he burned, or the way that she died

Though the story never ends
Let's celebrate, remember a year

Friday night and the moon is high
I'm wide-awake just watching you sleep
And I promise you you're going to have
More than just the things that you need
We have not got much now, we’re just starting out
But I know somehow paradise is coming

Someday baby, you and I are gonna be the ones
Good luck's going to shine
Someday baby you and I are gonna be the ones
So hold on
We're headed for a better life

Oh now there's a place for you and me
Where we can dream as big as the sky
I know it's hard to see it now
But baby someday we're going to fly
This road we're on, you know it might be long
But my faith is strong
It's all that really matters

Someday baby, you and I are gonna be the ones
Good luck's gonna shine

Come on baby, hold on

See that big blue note over there on the counter
You don't want to read that thing man
It's a real get-ya-downer
But don't you dare say nothing else bad about her
She's gone

[Verse 2]
No, no, no, no don-don't throw it away
'Cause tonight I might need it
It gets real lonely around here at night sometimes
And I have to reread it
Besides, you can show it to the boys downtown
And they won't believe that
She's gone

[Chorus]
There used to be a time I was all she ever wanted
All the man that she'll ever need
I come home to find just like that she's up and vanished
And the only thing she left behind for me

[Bridge]
Is this big blue note folded up in my pocket
Yeah don't laugh, it's been two months I still got it
Sometimes I have to read the sucker twice
Just to make sure I ain't forgot that
She's gone

[Verse 3]
You know my psychiatrist said, ""Tell me what do you see
When you look at these ink spots of reds and yellows and green?""
You know, I looked at them all, but all they looked to me like
Big blue notes

[Chorus]
There used to be a time I was all she ever wanted
All the man that she'll ever need
I come home to find just like that she's up and vanished
And the only thing that's left to do for me

[Verse 4]
Is stand high on this cliff overlooking the sea
With my big blue note paper airplane that I just set free
And I'm gonna wait here a few more minutes
And if it don't come back to me
You guessed it
She's gone

He who makes a beast out of himself
Gets rid of the pain of being a man

[Verse 1]
Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
I tried, to drive all through the night
The heat stroke ridden weather, the barren empty sights
No oasis, here to see
The sand is singing deathless words to me

[Chorus]
Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn? (All alone)
Too many doses, and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (All alone)
No one can save me, and you know I don't want the attention

[Verse 2]
As I, adjust to my new sights
The rarely tired lights, will take me to new heights
My hand is on the trigger, I'm ready to ignite
Tomorrow might not make it, but everything's all right
Mental fiction, follow me
Show me what it's like to be set free

[Chorus]
Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn? (All alone)
Too many doses, and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (All alone)
No one can save me, and you know I don't want the attention

[Post-Chorus]
So sorry you're not here, I've
Been sane too long, my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me, but
Don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem

[Bridge]
Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
These eyes won't see the same, after I flip today

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I don't know why, we'd rather live than die
We look up towards the sky, for answers to our lives
We may get some solutions, but most just pass us by
Don't want your absolution, 'cause I can't make it right

[Hook]
I'll make a beast out of myself
Gets rid of all the pain of being a man

[Chorus]
Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn? (All alone)
Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (All alone)
No one can save me and you know I don't want the attention

[Post-Chorus]
So sorry you're not here, I've
Been sane too long my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me, but
Don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem

I got miles of trouble spreading far and wide
Bills on the table getting higher and higher
They just keep on coming, there ain't no end in sight

And I'm thankful for that each and every day
And if I count all my blessings, I get a smile on my face
Still it's hard to find faith

And tell me we'll be alright
If you promise never to leave
You just might make me believe

What I'd give for an address out on easy street
I need a deep margarita to help me unwind
Leave my troubles behind

Oh, you know I did it
It's over and I feel fine
Nothing you could say is gonna change my mind
Waited and I waited the longest night
Nothing like the taste of sweet decline

[Verse 1]
I was down, and I fell, I fell so fast
Dropping like the grains in an hourglass
Never say forever cause nothing lasts
Dancing with the bones of my buried past

[Pre-Chorus]
Never mind there's nothing I could do
Bet your life there's something killing you

[Chorus]
It's a shame we have to die my dear
No one's getting out of here alive
This time
What a way to go, but have no fear
No one's getting out of here alive
This time

[Verse 2]
I'm finished, I'm getting you off my chest
Made you come clean in a dirty dress
A promise is a promise you kept in check
Hard to cross a heart that beats this fast

[Interlude]
Take a good hard look for the very last time
The very last one in a very long line
Only took a second to say goodbye
Been a pleasure, but the pleasure's been mine all mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Never mind there's nothing I could do
Bet your life there's something killing you

[Chorus]
It's a shame we have to die my dear

No one's getting out of here alive

There were times I thought I'd never so the break of day
It was hard for me to see your plan for me
And I tried to believe surely it won't last always

[Prehook 1]
But night after night
Night after night
Night after night
I pray Lord, don't take Your joy from me
Then late one night I read in Your love letter that it's gonna get better

I've been looking for you
I realized that nothing else will satisfy me
I'm so glad I found You
Now that I'm changed no one can keep me away from You

When my enemies, tried to come for me
And they thought that my world was coming to an end
All the while You knew
That I would make it through
I feel closer to You now than I was when I first began

85,85,Tonight I Wanna Cry,"[Verse 1]
Alone in this house again tonight
I got the TV on, the sound turned down and a bottle of wine
There's pictures of you and I on the walls around me
The way that it was and could have been surrounds me
I'll never get over you walking away

[Chorus]
I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that being strong meant never losing your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain
To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain
From my eyes
Tonight I wanna cry

[Verse 2]
Would it help if I turned a sad song on
""All By Myself"" would sure hit me hard now that you're gone
Or maybe unfold some old yellow lost love letters
It's going to hurt bad before it gets better
But I'll never get over you by hiding this way

[Chorus]
I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that being strong meant never losing your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain
To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain
From my eyes
Tonight I wanna cry
I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that being strong meant never losing your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain

87,87,My Old Friend,"[Verse 1]
My old friend, I recall
The times we had hanging on my wall
I would not trade them for gold
Because they laugh and they cry me
Somehow sanctify me
They are woven in the stories I have told
And tell again

[Verse 2]
My old friend, I apologize
For the years that have passed
Since the last time you and I
Dusted off those memories
But the running and the races
The people and the places
There is always somewhere else I had to be
Time gets slim, my old friend

[Interlude]
Do not know why, do not know why
Do not know why, do not know why

[Verse 3]
My old friend, this song is for you
Because a few simple verses
Was the least that I could do
To tell the world that you were here
Because the love and the laughter
Will live on long after
All of the sadness and the tears
We will meet again, my old friend

[Outro]
Goodbye, goodbye

Woah, woah
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Yeah, uh-huh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yo, tell me fellas have you seen her? (Seen her)
It was about five minutes ago
When I seen the hottest chick that a youngin' never seen before
I say, ""Yo, tell the girls I wanna meet her"" (Meet her)
On second thought that ain't the way to go
I gotta give her game proper
Spit it so she'll get it, there she is I gotta stop her
Oh, should I talk about her smile? (It's been said before)
Or what about her style? (Too obvious)
I'm out of time, she's out the door
I gotta go for mine, I think I'll say

[Chorus]
Yo
I don't know your name but excuse me miss (Oh yeah)
I saw you from across the room
And I got to admit that you got my attention
You're making me wanna say yo
I know you're tryna leave but excuse me miss
I saved the last dance for you
I would love to keep you here with me, oh baby

[Verse 2]
Now shawty, grab hold of my hand
And let's pretend the floor is ours
You say you don't really dance
Don't worry 'bout it, we just one-two step, one-two step
Now if the music is moving too fast (Too fast)
Grab my hand a little tighter (Tighter)
Don't be afraid to move a little closer
Girl, there's something about you that makes me wanna say (Aw yeah, aw yeah)

[Chorus]
Yo
I don't know your name but excuse me miss (Ooh)
I saw you from across the room
And I got to admit that you got my attention
You're making me wanna say yo
I know you're tryna leave but excuse me miss (Ooh)
I saved the last dance for you
I would love to keep you here with me, oh baby
I think I'll say yo
I don't know your name but excuse me miss
I saw you from across the room
And I got to admit that you got my attention
You're making me wanna say yo
I know you're tryna leave but excuse me miss
I saved the last dance for you
I would love to keep you here with me, oh baby

[Bridge]
I wanna be where you are
Ain't nothing wrong with dancing
Baby, it's so romantic
Baby, I can be in your heart
So many things I wanna tell you
I think that I should start by saying

[Chorus]
Yo, woah
I don't know your name but excuse me miss (Oh yeah)
I saw you from across the room
I gotta give her game proper
Spit it so she'll get it, there she is I gotta stop her (Oh yeah)
I know you're tryna leave but excuse me miss (Oh)
I saved the last dance for you
I would love to keep you here with me, oh baby

[Outro]
Now everybody just clap your hands like this (Like this)
Just clap your hands like this (Woah, like this, huh)
And if your shorty's in the house tonight
Just grab her by the hand, homie, make her understand

Y'all was made to bounce like this (Woah, like this)

I'm waitin' on the sun to set 'cause yesterday ain't over yet
I started smoking cigarettes, there's nothing else to do I guess
Dusty roads ain't made for walkin', spinnin' tires ain't made for stoppin'
I'm givin' up on love 'cause love's given up on me

[Verse 2]
I gave it everything I had and everything I got was bad
Life ain't hard, but it's too long to live it like some country song
Trade the truth in for a lie, cheatin' really ain't a crime
I'm givin' up on love 'cause love's given up on me

[Verse 3]
Forget your high society, I'm soakin' it in kerosene
Light 'em up and watch them burn, teach them what they need to learn; ha!
Dirty hands ain't made for shakin', ain't a rule that ain't worth breakin'
Well, I'm givin' up on love 'cause love's given up on me

[Verse 4]

Can't believe all the lies that you told
Just to ease your own soul
But I'm bigger than that
No, you don't have my back

Hey, how long till you face what's going on?

And that I answered the telephone
Don't be worried, I'm not with him
And when I go out tonight, I'm going home alone

I'm a mess, girl for sure
All I want is some fun
Guess that I'd better run
Hollywood sucks you in, but it won't spit me out

And tell yourself, ""You'll be the death of me""

[Verse 2]
I don't need a friend, I need to mend so far away
So come, sit by the fire and play a while, but you can't stay too long
It aches in every bone, I'll die alone, but not for pleasure
I see my heart explode, it's been eroded by the weather here
If you want me, hold me back

[Chorus]
Frail, the skin is dry and pale, the pain will never fail
And so we go back to the remedy
Clip the wings that get you high, just leave 'em where they lie
And tell yourself, ""You'll be the death of me""
Frail, the skin is dry and pale, the pain will never fail
And so we go back to the remedy
Clip the wings that get you high, just leave 'em where they lie
And tell yourself, ""You'll be the death of me""

[Bridge]
Hold your eyes closed, take me in
Hold your eyes closed, take me in

[Chorus]
Frail, the skin is dry and pale, the pain will never fail
And so we go back to the remedy
Clip the wings that get you high, just leave 'em where they lie
And tell yourself, ""You'll be the death of me""

94,94,Believe,"[Verse 1]
Old man Wrigley lived in that white house
Down the street where I grew up
Mama used to send me over with things
We struck a friendship up
I spent a few long summers
Out on his old porch swing

[Verse 2]
Said he was in the war when in the navy
Lost his wife, lost his baby
Broke down and asked him one time
""How you keep from goin' crazy""
He said, ""I'll see my wife and son in just a little while""
I asked him what he meant, he looked at me and smiled

[Chorus]
Said, ""I raise my hands
Bow my head
I'm findin' more and more truth
In the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to life
Than just what I can see, oh, I believe""

[Verse 3]
A few years later I was off at college
Talkin' to mom on the phone one night
Gettin' all caught up on the gossip
The ins and outs of the small town life
She said, ""Oh, by the way son
Old man Wrigley has died""

[Verse 4]
Later on that night
I laid there thinkin' back
Thought about a couple long-lost summers
I didn't know whether to cry or laugh
If there was ever anybody
Deserved a ticket to the other side
It'd be that sweet old man
Who looked me in the eye

[Chorus]
Said, ""I raise my hands
Bow my head
I'm findin' more and more truth
In the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to life
Than just what I can see...""

[Bridge]
I can't quote the book
The chapter or the verse
You can't tell me it all ends
In a slow ride in a hearse
You know I'm more and more convinced
The longer that I live
Yeah, this can't be... no, this can't be
No, this can't be all there is

[Chorus]
Lord, I raise my hands
Bow my head
Oh, I'm findin' more and more truth
In the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to this
Than just what I can see, I believe

96,96,Confessions Of A Broken Heart (Daughter To Father),"[Verse 1]
I wait for the postman
To bring me a letter
I wait for the good Lord
To make me feel better
And I carry the weight of the world
On my shoulders
A family in crisis
That only grows older
Why’d you have to go?
Why’d you have to go?
Why’d you have to go?

[Chorus]
Daughter to father
Daughter to father
I am broken
But I am hoping
Daughter to father
Daughter to father
I am cryin'
A part of me's dying
But these are
These are
The confessions of a broken heart

[Verse 2]
And I wear all your old clothes
Your polo sweater
I dream of another you
One who would never
Never leave me alone to pick up the pieces
A daddy to hold me
That’s what I needed
So why’d you have to go?
Why’d you have to go?
Why’d you have to go?

[Chorus]
Daughter to father
Daughter to father
I don’t know you
But I still want to
Daughter to father
Daughter to father
Tell me the truth
Did you ever love me?
'Cause these are
These are
The confessions of a broken heart
Of a broken heart

I... love you
I... love you

She don't tell me to

Any other woman I know would have tried
To control me and it would be over
Plannin' on my goin' on my own way attitude
All of that stubborness melts away
When I wake with her head on my shoulder
An' I know I've got to love her
Until my life is through
'Cause she don't tell me to

Well, I got demons and I've got pride
But when I'm wrong, I apologise like she's mine to lose
'Cause she don't tell me to
Well, I got dreams in this heart of mine
But nothin' that I wouldn't lay aside if she asked me to
'Cause she don't tell me to
An' she don't even know
That she keeps lookin' for the next right thing to do
'Cause she don't tell me to
Yeah, yeah

Any other woman I know would have tried
To control me and it would be over
Plannin' on my goin' on my own way attitude
And all of that stubborness melts away
When I wake with her head on my shoulder
An' I know I've got to love her
Until my life is through
What else can I do?
What else can I do?
Whoa, I love her
'Cause she don't tell me to
She don't tell me to

98,98,Have A Nice Day,"[Verse 1]
Why, you wanna tell me how to live my life?
Who, are you to tell me if it's black or white?
Mama, can you hear me? Try to understand
Is innocence the difference between a boy and a man?
My daddy lived the lie, that's just the price that he paid
Sacrificed his life, just slaving away

[Chorus]
Ohhh, if there's one thing I hang onto
That gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to
I'm gonna live my life
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice
Standing on the ledge, I show the wind how to fly
When the world gets in my face
I say, have a nice day
Have a nice day

[Verse 2]
Take a look around you; nothing's what it seems
We're living in the broken home of hopes and dreams
Let me be the first to shake a helping hand
Anybody brave enough to take a stand
I've knocked on every door, on every dead end street
Looking for forgiveness
What's left to believe?

[Chorus]
Ohhh, if there's one thing I hang onto
That gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to
I'm gonna live my life
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice
Standing on the ledge, I show the wind how to fly
When the world gets in my face
I say, have a nice day
Have a nice day

[Chorus]
Ohhh, if there's one thing I hang onto
That gets me through the night
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to
I'm gonna live my life
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice
Standing on the ledge, I show the wind how to fly
When the world gets in my face
I say, have a nice day
Have a nice day

Have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day

[Outro]
When The world keeps trying, to drag me down
I gotta raise my hands, I'm gonna stand my ground
Well I say, have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day","['why', 'you', 'wanna', 'tell', 'me', 'how', 'to', 'live', 'my', 'life', 'who', 'be', 'you', 'to', 'tell', 'me', 'if', 'its', 'black', 'or', 'white', 'mama', 'can', 'you', 'hear', 'me', 'try', 'to', 'understand', 'be', 'innocence', 'the', 'difference', 'between', 'a', 'boy', 'and', 'a', 'man', 'my', 'daddy', 'live', 'the', 'lie', 'thats', 'just', 'the', 'price', 'that', 'he', 'pay', 'sacrifice', 'his', 'life', 'just', 'slave', 'away', 'ohhh', 'if', 'theres', 'one', 'thing', 'i', 'hang', 'onto', 'that', 'get', 'me', 'through', 'the', 'night', 'i', 'aint', 'gonna', 'do', 'what', 'i', 'dont', 'want', 'to', 'im', 'gonna', 'live', 'my', 'life', 'shin', 'like', 'a', 'diamond', 'roll', 'with', 'the', 'dice', 'stand', 'on', 'the', 'ledge', 'i', 'show', 'the', 'wind', 'how', 'to', 'fly', 'when', 'the', 'world', 'get', 'in', 'my', 'face', 'i', 'say', 'have', 'a', 'nice', 'day', 'have', 'a', 'nice', 'day', 'take', 'a', 'look', 'around', 'you', 'nothings', 'what', 'it', 'seem', 'be', 'live', 'in', 'the', 'break', 'home', 'of', 'hop', 'and', 'dream', 'let', 'me', 'be', 'the', 'first', 'to', 'shake', 'a', 'help', 'hand', 'anybody', 'brave', 'enough', 'to', 'take', 'a', 'stand', 'ive', 'knock', 'on', 'every', 'door', 'on', 'every', 'dead', 'end', 'street', 'look', 'for', 'forgiveness', 'whats', 'leave', 'to', 'believe', 'ohhh', 'if', 'theres', 'one', 'thing', 'i', 'hang', 'onto', 'that', 'get', 'me', 'through', 'the', 'night', 'i', 'aint', 'gonna', 'do', 'what', 'i', 'dont', 'want', 'to', 'im', 'gonna', 'live', 'my', 'life', 'shin', 'like', 'a', 'diamond', 'roll', 'with', 'the', 'dice', 'stand', 'on', 'the', 'ledge', 'i', 'show', 'the', 'wind', 'how', 'to', 'fly', 'when', 'the', 'world', 'get', 'in', 'my', 'face', 'i', 'say', 'have', 'a', 'nice', 'day', 'have', 'a', 'nice', 'day', 'ohhh', 'if', 'theres', 'one', 'thing', 'i', 'hang', 'onto', 'that', 'get', 'me', 'through', 'the', 'night', 'i', 'aint', 'gonna', 'do', 'what', 'i', 'dont', 'want', 'to', 'im', 'gonna', 'live', 'my', 'life', 'shin', 'like', 'a', 'diamond', 'roll', 'with', 'the', 'dice', 'stand', 'on', 'the', 'ledge', 'i', 'show', 'the', 'wind', 'how', 'to', 'fly', 'when', 'the', 'world', 'get', 'in', 'my', 'face', 'i', 'say', 'have', 'a', 'nice', 'day', 'have', 'a', 'nice', 'day', 'have', 'a', 'nice', 'day', 'have', 'a', 'nice', 'day', 'have', 'a', 'nice', 'day', 'have', 'a', 'nice', 'day', 'when', 'the', 'world', 'keep', 'try', 'to', 'drag', 'me', 'down', 'i', 'gotta', 'raise', 'my', 'hand', 'im', 'gonna', 'stand', 'my', 'grind', 'well', 'i', 'say', 'have', 'a', 'nice', 'day', 'have', 'a', 'nice', 'day', 'have', 'a', 'nice', 'day']",352,Bon Jovi,Bon Jovi,2005,"[99, 95, 96, 95, 97, 93, 90, 75, 53, 58]",10,Who Says You Can't Go Home,https://open.spotify.com/track/5439qJTu5mVH9aeriwp03u,5439qJTu5mVH9aeriwp03u,spotify:track:5439qJTu5mVH9aeriwp03u,Have A Nice Day,3VfBy3QX5peTfME0UxzZ2P,spotify:album:3VfBy3QX5peTfME0UxzZ2P,Bon Jovi,58lV9VcRSjABbAbfWS6skp,spotify:artist:58lV9VcRSjABbAbfWS6skp,230.28,13.0,54.0,2005-01-01,0.537,0.885,7.0,-3.641,1.0,0.0343,0.0437,0.0,0.27399999999999997,0.802,131.69799999999998,"['glam metal', 'rock']",[],1.0
99,99,Comin' To Your City,"[Chorus:]
Well we're comin to your city
Gonna play our guitars and sing you a country song
We'll all be flyin higher than a jet air liner
And if you want a little bang in your ying yang come along

Well we flew through Cincinnati
And we all got really happy
Grabbed a bowl of that Skyline Chili along the way
Then we rolled on into Canton
Scared the hell out of Marilyn Manson
And the party started happenin
Hey hey hey

Then in the middle of a Charleston night
We ran into Jesco White
And a little moonshine got us right plum smacked insane

[Chorus]

Well we broke down in Greenville
In the middle of a hayfield
But a Bud Light truck pulled up and helped us out

So we then headed up to Philly
Partied down like real hillbillies
Brought the Music Mafia
And rocked it out

And Chippewa's where we go
When we're up in Buffalo
Don't you know those yankees drink enough to DROWN

[Chorus]

Listen up
Now LA's got the freaks
At Pink's and 15 dollar drinks
And San Antonio was a wild wild rodeo

And then Phoenix, Arizona
We drank way too much Corona
And we woke up by the river
In Jeff City, MO

[Chorus]

Yeah, yeah
We're comin to your city
We're gonna play our guitars and sing you a country song
We'll all be flyin higher than a jet air liner

If you wanna little ting in your tang tang

I ain't never had nobody show me all the things that you done showed me

We gon' always be together, baby - that's what you told me and I believe it
Cause I ain't neva had nobody do me like you

[Verse 1: Bow Wow, Ciara]
Now, I done been with different kind of girls
Like I done seen them all but ain't none of them at all (Like you)
And I done seen the best of the best
Baby, still I ain't impressed cause ain't none of them at all (Like you)
If you know how I feel when I chill
If I'm seen with a girl then she gotta be just (Like you)
And baby, that's the way I feel
And I got no choice but for me to keep it real
Cause when we, first got together started hanging out you was
Skeptical at first had to figure out if
I was the kinda guy to try to dog you out, but
I ain't that kinda guy you tried to make me out
You found out when you turned to my baby

I let you drive when I ride that Mercedes
And I ain't trippin' or actin' shady cause baby, you know

Your love is amazing to me
I can't wait 'til I see you - I wanna be with you again
And every time you're out on the road (I make a trip)
And whenever I'm doing a show (Don't you forget)

One and the same chick - the one you can hang with

Feel like I ain't doing enough that's when I shared more

You know I got it holla at me if you need love
And affection cause I'll be your protection
Kinda hard job but I do it to perfection
And you can tell that I ain't trying to let you go

And you be tripping cause sometimes I gotta go

And I was tripping in a sense I was tense
But my body loose around you what I'mma do without you

Remembering the girl leaves me down and loney

104,104,Can I Have It Like That,"[Intro: Pharrell]
Ladies and Gentlemen
Yes, Sir... let's do it
Yes, Sir... hot... yo

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
On and on and, my nuts I'm palmin'
Take two of these and call me in the morning
You should see the way the chain harness the charm and
Fly, I'm like a bird like Nelly Furtado
Shit, pop your bottles, toast and scream, ""Cheers!""
Get your two-step 'cause this the record of the year
Nigga that brought you Ice Creams, two for a pair
Officially announcing, ""This is warfare,"" 'cause
Back in the day, my clouds was grey
And it seemed liked my angels couldn't blow them away
But then I sold my first verse and copped that NSX
But I was still ridin' in them thin-ass jets, but now
Man, my vision so clear out the window of the Lear
And I'm talkin' on my celly all the shit that you should hear
Listen clearly now
Hello? Can you hear me now?

[Hook: Pharrell & Gwen Stefani]
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
So drop your purse and grab your hips (Uh huh)
And act like you tryin' to get this money right quick
So can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)

[Verse 2: Pharrell]
On and on and, this beat is on and
I control their mind from straight over the phone
And let 'em explore the words, something like a tourist
And never get addicted unless that heady-wop is serious (Yes, Sir)
From Louisville to Jimmy Choos, he's real
She know the time, she sees the Richard Mille
Plat-double skeletal, Tourbillion
It's just like her body, move, it turns her on
She like the way my hands use her body for hand warmers
And all our car doors go up like Transformers
See, I can do it this-a-way, I can do it that-a-way
From the crib in Virginia to that new Miami getaway
So cool it like New Edition unless you hot as you say
I get it, okay, let it boil away
But please run along, 'cause ladies is feelin' wrong
And I got something right for them right after this song
My name is Skate... board... P
Ladies and gentlemen

[Hook: Pharrell & Gwen Stefani]
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
So drop your purse and grab your hips (Uh huh)
And act like you tryin' to get this money right quick
So can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)

[Verse 3: Pharrell]
On and on and, the temperature is warm and
I spit heat flashes, niggas get nauseous
Bright as a bitch, so analyze with caution
When the light hit the ice, bet a hundred that you vomit
And should I mention the fact the Transition is the track?
No incision to the vision just to get me where I’m at, huh
Little Skateboard, he too grown (Come on)
Ridin' up and down Collins in that that new Two-Tone
It's so cold, you don't wanna feel the chill of it (Uh)
Just stand back and just look at the grill of it (Uh)
I don't smoke but I bet the sense a mil' of it
Totally intensifies the vivid-ass appeal of it
You can be jealous, and grit your teeth (Uh huh)
But all these little niggas got somethin' in reach
So, you want heat? These niggas can front heat
While I'm on my boat party, tryin' to Sunseek
My name is Skate... board... P

I'm becoming less defined
As days go by
Fading away
And well you might say
I'm losing focus
Kind of drifting into the abstract
In terms of how I see myself

Sometimes I think I can see right through myself
Sometimes I think I can see right through myself
Sometimes I can see right through myself

[Verse 2]
Less concerned about fitting into the world
Your world, that is
Cause it doesn't really matter anymore
(No it doesn't really matter anymore)
No it doesn't really matter anymore
None of this really matters anymore

Yes I am alone
But then again I always was
As far back as I can tell
I think maybe it's because
Because you were never really real
To begin with
I just made you up
To hurt myself

[Interlude]
I just made you up
To hurt myself, yeah
And I just made you up
To hurt myself
I just made you up
To hurt myself, yeah
And I just made you up
To hurt myself
And it worked
Yes it did!

Well the tiniest little dot caught my eye
And it turned out to be a scab
And I had this funny feeling
Like I just knew it's something bad
I just couldn't leave it alone
I kept picking at the scab
It was a doorway trying to seal itself shut
But I climbed through

Now I am somewhere I am not supposed to be
And I can see things I know I really shouldn't see
And now I know why, now, now, now I know why
Things aren't as pretty
On the inside

Yeah, uh-uh
La, da, da, da, da
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
Hey baby, my nose is gettin' big
I noticed it be growin' when I been tellin' them fibs, now
You say your trust's gettin' weaker
Probably 'cause my lies just started gettin' deeper
And the reason for my confession is that I learned my lesson
And I really think you ought to know the truth
Because I lied and I cheated and I lied a little more
But after what you did, I don't know what I did it for
I admit that I've been a little immature
With your heart like I was the predator
In my book of lies, I was the editor
And the author, I forged my signature
And now I apologize for what I did to ya
'Cause what you did to me I did to you

[Hook: Fergie]
No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no, don't lie ('cause)
No, no, no, no, yeah, no, no, no, no, you gotta try
What you gonna do when it all comes out
When I really see you and what you all are about?
No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no, don't lie
'Cause you know, you know, you know, you know
You know you gotta try (Stop, st-stop, stop, st-stop stop lying)

[Verse 2: apl.de.ap]
She said ""I'm leavin'""
'Cause she can't take the pain
It's hard to continue this love, it ain't the same
Can't forget the things that I've done inside her brain
Too many lies committed, too many games
She feelin' like a fool gettin' on the last train
Tryna maintain, but the feeling won't change
I'm sorry for the things that I've done and what I became
Caught up in living my life in the fast lane
Blinded by lights, cameras, you know the fame
I don't know the reason why I did these things

[Pre-Hook 2: Fergie, will.i.am (& apl.de.ap)]
Oh, when I lie and I lie and I lie and I lie
(And now our emotions are drained)
'Cause I lie and I lie and a little lie, lie
And now your emotions are drained

[Hook 2: Fergie]
No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no, don't lie (no, don't you lie)
No, no, no, no, yeah, no, no, no, no, you gotta try (got to, got to try)
What you gonna do when it all comes out (what you gonna do, baby?)
When I really see you and what you all are about?
No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no, don't lie
Because you know, you know, you know, you know
You know you gotta try

[Verse 3: Taboo]
Yo, I'm lying to my girl
Even though I love her and she all in my world
I give her all my attention and diamonds and pearls
She the one that make me feel on top of the world
Still I lie to my girl, I do it

[Pre-Hook 3: Fergie & Taboo, Both]
Oh, when I lie and I lie and I lie and then I lie
Till there's not turning back
I don't know why and I lie and I lie
Till I don't know who I am
Let me tell myself

[Hook 3: Fergie]
No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no, don't lie (don't you lie)
No, no, no, no, yeah, no, no, no, no, you gotta try (you know, you know you gotta)
What you gonna do when it all comes out
When I really see you and what you all are about?

108,108,Skin (Sarabeth),"Sarah Beth is scared to death
To hear what the doctor will say
She hasn't been well
Since the day that she fell
And the bruise, it just won't go away

So she sits and she waits, with her mother and dad
And flips through an old magazine
Till a nurse with a smile
Stands at the door
And says, 'Will you please come with me?'

Sarah Beth is scared to death
'Cause the doctor just told her the news
Between the red cells and white
Something's not right
But we're gonna take care of you

Six chances in ten, it won't come back again
With the therapy we're gonna try
It's just been approved
It's the strongest there is
I think we caught it in time

Sarah Beth closes her eyes
She dreams she's dancing
Around and around, without any cares
And her very first love is holding her close
And the soft wind is blowing her hair

Sarah Beth is scared to death
As she sits, holding her mom
Says it would be a mistake
For someone to take
A girl with no hair to the prom

For just this morning, right there on her pillow
Was the cruelest of any surprise
And she cried when she gathered it all in her hands
The proof that she couldn't deny

Sarah Beth closes her eyes
She dreams she's dancing
Around and around, without any cares
And her very first love is holding her close
And the soft wind is blowing her hair

It's quarter to seven, that boy is at the door
Her Daddy ushers him in
When he takes off his cap, they all start to cry
'Cause this morning where his hair had been
Softly, she touches just skin

They go dancing
Around and around, without any cares
And her very first, true love is holding her close
And for a moment, she isn't scared","['sarah', 'beth', 'be', 'scar', 'to', 'death', 'to', 'hear', 'what', 'the', 'doctor', 'will', 'say', 'she', 'hasnt', 'be', 'well', 'since', 'the', 'day', 'that', 'she', 'fell', 'and', 'the', 'bruise', 'it', 'just', 'wont', 'go', 'away', 'so', 'she', 'sit', 'and', 'she', 'wait', 'with', 'her', 'mother', 'and', 'dad', 'and', 'flip', 'through', 'an', 'old', 'magazine', 'till', 'a', 'nurse', 'with', 'a', 'smile', 'stand', 'at', 'the', 'door', 'and', 'say', 'will', 'you', 'please', 'come', 'with', 'me', 'sarah', 'beth', 'be', 'scar', 'to', 'death', 'cause', 'the', 'doctor', 'just', 'tell', 'her', 'the', 'news', 'between', 'the', 'red', 'cells', 'and', 'white', 'somethings', 'not', 'right', 'but', 'be', 'gonna', 'take', 'care', 'of', 'you', 'six', 'chance', 'in', 'ten', 'it', 'wont', 'come', 'back', 'again', 'with', 'the', 'therapy', 'be', 'gonna', 'try', 'its', 'just', 'be', 'approve', 'its', 'the', 'strongest', 'there', 'be', 'i', 'think', 'we', 'catch', 'it', 'in', 'time', 'sarah', 'beth', 'close', 'her', 'eye', 'she', 'dream', 'shes', 'dance', 'around', 'and', 'around', 'without', 'any', 'care', 'and', 'her', 'very', 'first', 'love', 'be', 'hold', 'her', 'close', 'and', 'the', 'soft', 'wind', 'be', 'blow', 'her', 'hair', 'sarah', 'beth', 'be', 'scar', 'to', 'death', 'as', 'she', 'sit', 'hold', 'her', 'mom', 'say', 'it', 'would', 'be', 'a', 'mistake', 'for', 'someone', 'to', 'take', 'a', 'girl', 'with', 'no', 'hair', 'to', 'the', 'prom', 'for', 'just', 'this', 'morning', 'right', 'there', 'on', 'her', 'pillow', 'be', 'the', 'cruelest', 'of', 'any', 'surprise', 'and', 'she', 'cry', 'when', 'she', 'gather', 'it', 'all', 'in', 'her', 'hand', 'the', 'proof', 'that', 'she', 'couldnt', 'deny', 'sarah', 'beth', 'close', 'her', 'eye', 'she', 'dream', 'shes', 'dance', 'around', 'and', 'around', 'without', 'any', 'care', 'and', 'her', 'very', 'first', 'love', 'be', 'hold', 'her', 'close', 'and', 'the', 'soft', 'wind', 'be', 'blow', 'her', 'hair', 'its', 'quarter', 'to', 'seven', 'that', 'boy', 'be', 'at', 'the', 'door', 'her', 'daddy', 'usher', 'him', 'in', 'when', 'he', 'take', 'off', 'his', 'cap', 'they', 'all', 'start', 'to', 'cry', 'cause', 'this', 'morning', 'where', 'his', 'hair', 'have', 'be', 'softly', 'she', 'touch', 'just', 'skin', 'they', 'go', 'dance', 'around', 'and', 'around', 'without', 'any', 'care', 'and', 'her', 'very', 'first', 'true', 'love', 'be', 'hold', 'her', 'close', 'and', 'for', 'a', 'moment', 'she', 'isnt', 'scar']",318,Rascal Flatts,Rascal Flatts,2005,"[98, 81, 68, 53, 50, 44, 46, 42, 46, 58, 65, 75, 79, 86]",14,Skin (Sarabeth),https://open.spotify.com/track/0NB8Y8TXV0UTUoq9XHuOIr,0NB8Y8TXV0UTUoq9XHuOIr,spotify:track:0NB8Y8TXV0UTUoq9XHuOIr,Feels Like Today,5NH87jdrVjOHt8gDMHT1Wy,spotify:album:5NH87jdrVjOHt8gDMHT1Wy,Rascal Flatts,0a1gHP0HAqALbEyxaD5Ngn,spotify:artist:0a1gHP0HAqALbEyxaD5Ngn,261.26599999999996,12.0,40.0,2004-01-01,0.484,0.299,2.0,-9.902999999999999,1.0,0.0286,0.483,0.00011200000000000001,0.145,0.23199999999999998,139.87,"['contemporary country', 'country', 'country road']",[],1.0

Don't know why but the ladies call me Baby Blue
The sticker, they take me and rape me
And make me their victim
I leave 'em, the freaks
But if they married, I stick 'em
And if they look like wifey material, then I keep 'em
Stunning through the city trying find a lady who's beautiful
But she gotta have booty too
Baby Blue don't let you do what you wanna do
You can feel on it if you really want to
Get a taste of this salami
Knock, knock, knock, knock you down like a tsunami
Busting you like a tummy
I'm ahead of my class
Getting head in the Jag
Look in the duffle bag
See Benjamin's head on the cash

Tryna beat it up like a everlast punching bag
Hotter than a Bisquik biscuit out the oven
Yo babymama go on missions to get this loving
We kissing and hugging
She never picked the phone up
You be looking for her while we be doing the grown up
She complain when she catch back spasms
But she loves when she get back to back orgasms
Yes, sir the game is off the map
You give it to them one time and they come back like addicts

Right, lookin, smelling good
Looking good, smack it baby
Pure pleasureful (That's all we got)
Let me drop my top
Pull up in the parking lot
Grab a grape soda, a bag of chips (That's all I got)
Park outside
Met up wit my homeboys
Fake guys, fake girl, leave me alone boy
Plus the Cadi looking good enought to eat
You can tell by the way the girls acting across the street
But on the other hand, Alfapha just hit me on my metro cell
Party in the park

So I jumped out the white Jag smooth like Shaft, come here girl

110,110,Something To Be Proud Of,"[Verse 1]
There's a story that my daddy tells religiously
Like clockwork every time he see's an opening
In a conversation, 'bout the way things used to be
I just roll my eyes and make a B-line for the door
I'd always end up starry eyed and cross legged on the floor
Hanging onto every word
Man, the things I heard
It was harder times and longer days
Five miles to school uphill both ways
We were cane switched raised and dirt floor poor
Course that was back before the war
Yea your uncle and I made quite a pair
Flying F-15's through hostile air
He went down but they missed me by a hair
He'd always stop right there and say

[Chorus]
That's something to be proud of
That's a life you can hang your hat on
As your chins held high as the tears fall down
Gut sucked in, chest stuck out
Like a small town flag a flying
Or a new born baby crying
In the arms of the woman that you love
That's something to be proud of

[Verse 2]
Son graduating college, that was momma's dream
And I was on my way to anywhere else when I turned Eighteen
Cause when you got a fast car, and think you got everything
I learned real quick those GTO's don't run off faith
I ended up broke down in some town north of L.A
Working maximum hours, for minimum wage
I fell in love next thing I know
Babies came and the car got sold
Sure do miss that old Hot Rod
But you sure save gas in them foreign jobs
Dad I wonder if I ever let you down
If you're ashamed how I turned out
Well he lowered his voice, then he raised his brow
Said let me tell you right now

[Chorus]
That's something to be proud of
That's a life you can hang your hat on
No need to make a million just be thankful to be working
If you're doing what you're able
Putting food there on the table
And providing for the family that you love
That's something to be proud of

[Pre-Chorus]
And if all you ever really do is the best you can...
Well, you did it man

[Chorus]
That's something to be proud of
That's a life you can hang your hat on
As your chins held high as the tears fall down
Gut sucked in, chest stuck out
Like a small town flag a flying
Or a new born baby crying
In the arms of the woman that you love
That's something to be proud of
That's something to be proud of

111,111,Lighters Up,"[Verse 1]
I come from Bed-Stuy
Where niggas either do or they gon' die
Gotta keep the Ratchett close by
Someone murdered
Nobody seen, nobody heard it
Just another funeral service
Niggas will get at you
Come through shinin', they yap you
In broad daylight kidnap you
Feds get clap too
Police stay on us like tattoos
Niggas only grind 'cause we have to
Money is power
Sling crack, weed, and powder
Fiends come through every hour
It's all about that dollar
And we no deal with cowards
Weak lamb get devoured
By the lion in the concrete jungle
The strong stand and rumble
The weak fold and crumble
It's the land of trouble
Brooklyn home of the greatest rappers
BIG comes first then the queen comes after

[Hook]
Now put your lighters up (Bed-Stuy)
Put your lighters up (New York)
Put your lighters up (D.C.)
Keep putting your lighters up (Philadelphia)
Put your lighters up (Detroit)
Put your lighters up (Chi-Town)
Keep putting them lighters up
No matter where you from, put your lighters up

[Verse 2]
Now, let me give you a walk through
Show you what to do and you don't do
Where it's not safe to go to
Them boys approach you
Better say quick who you close to
Don't come through if niggas don't know you
'Cause people is talking
The streets is watching
The D's is lurking
Stash the nine in the garbage
The life of a hustler
The life of a gambler
Dice game, kill more niggas than cancer
You know who you fuck with
Brooklyn don't run, we run shit
Roll up and just bumrush shit
We don't play that
Out in BK, not at all
Gor a pound leave your face on the wall
R.I.P. in memory of
Never show thy enemies love
We get it on where we live
You better have a pass when you cross that bridge
Welcome to Brooklyn

[Hook]
Now put your lighters up (L.A.)
Put your lighters up (V.A.)
Put your lighters up (Texas)
Keep putting your lighters up (New Orleans)

Keep putting them lighters up
No matter where you from, put your lighters up

[Bridge]
Damn homie I'm so tore
And I don't think I'm ever gone smoke no more
And I don't think I'm ever gone drink no more
But fuck it, bartender you can give me one more
(We in the club like)
Damn homie I'm so tore
(Lighting the dutch like)
And I don't think I'm ever gone smoke no more
(Passing the bub like)
And I don't think I'm ever gone drink no more
(Back at the bar like)
Fuck it, bartender you can give me one more

[Verse 3]
See, BIG done told you
I'm the hottest bitch on the planet
Biggest sex symbol, since Janet
The Zanotti bandit
Laying in the cut like a bandage
Come through Fulton St. in the vanquish
Doing them damage
And if you don't understand it
Then let me give it to you in Spanish
Soy la señorita más linda del barrios
Y lo es abo tu eres despacio
Still over in Brazil sipping Moscato
You must of forgot though
So I'mma take you back to the block yo
Put you on to how we rock yo
Some are boosting
12-year-olds prostituting
Hit-men hired for execution
There's no solution
Niggas still piss in the hallways
Fiends get high on em' all day
The youth them bang at the cops off the roof
If you don't know my town is the truth
Welcome to Brooklyn

[Hook]
Now put your lighters up (New Jersey)
Put your lighters up (Boston)
Put your lighters up (B'more)

[Intro: Don Omar & Romeo Santos]
¡Don!
Another one, that's right
¡Don!
Dominicans, boricuas, hands up
On your feet everybody, come on
No hay pa' nadie pa', me fui con los bachateros
Aventura
Nasty

[Verso 1: Don Omar & Romeo Santos]
Ella y yo
Dos locos viviendo una aventura castigada por Dios
Un laberinto sin salida donde el miedo se convierte en amor
Somos su marido, ella y yo
Mi esposa y yo
Igual que ustedes, compartimos en la vida un eterno amor
La dama perfecta, toda una belleza, ella es mi inspiración
Somos feliz ella y yo, ella y yo
Amigo, ella y yo
Solos nos vemos a escondidas para ahogar esta prohibida pasión
Y aunque tenga dueño, yo solo tengo un sueño: ser su protector
Somos su marido, ella y yo

[Puente 1: Romeo Santos & Don Omar]
Oye Don, lucha por amor
No me aconsejes en tu posición
Quizás su marido no mande en su corazón
No sabes quién es victima en la confusión
Oye mi pana, lucha por amor
No, no me aconsejes en tu posición
Quizás ese tipo no mande en su corazón
Tú no sabes quién es victima en esta confusión

[Verso 2: Romeo Santos & Don Omar]
Mi esposa y yo
Somos felices, dos almas matrices, sé lo que es el amor
Por eso te entiendo y aunque sea casada, no te alejes por temor
No lo hagas Don
Ay, no, no, no
Mi amigo, ella y yo
Teníamos claro que era una locura esta relación
Pero la carne nos llamaba, y la cama nos hacía una invitación
A solo hacer el amor
Ay, ya te expliqué
Cuando hay personas que se aman, el amor tiene que vencer
Y que el marido entienda que perdió su hembra
Ahora es tu mujer
No pueden ganar los tres

[Puente 2: Romeo Santos & Don Omar]
Y te repito, lucha por amor
¡No me aconsejes en tu posición!
Quizás su marido no mande en su corazón
Tú no sabes quién es víctima en esta confusión
No seas tan tonto, lucha por amor
No, no me aconsejes en tu posición
Quizás ese tipo no mande en su corazón
Tú no sabes quién es víctima en esta confusión

[Interludio: Don Omar & Romeo Santos]
Lenny, deja que la República se sienta

Eliel
Esto e' pa' mi gente 'e Puerto Rico
¡Don! (¡Don!)

[Verso 3: Don Omar & Romeo Santos]
Amigo, pido perdón, yo nunca te fallé
Me traicionaron las ganas de volverla a ver
Y aunque todavía no puedo creer
Lo que este amargo encuentro me hizo comprender
Pues tú también llegaste a ese lugar
Donde tantas veces yo la fui a buscar
Y aunque no es fácil lo que voy a hacer
Admitiré que salí con tu mujer
Salí con tu mujer
¿Qué?
Salí con tu mujer
No, yo no estoy creyendo esto
Salí con tu mujer
No, no
Salí con tu mujer

[Verso 4: Romeo Santos]
Que te perdone Dios, yo no lo voy a hacer
Los perdí a los dos y a la misma vez
Ya veo que todo era mentira cuando ella me decía
Que se iba pa' Puerto Rico a vacaciones con su amiga, me mintió
Tú y ella en una cama, allá en Bayamón
Quizás en Isla Verde o Carolina, cuántos hoteles ensució
Tú también, los odio a los dos

[Outro: Don Omar & Romeo Santos]
Amigo, entiende
Que yo soy quien más sufro con todo esto
Me mata el dolor
Fue una traición
Perdí un amigo por la tentación
Perdón

Sometimes I imagine the world without you
But most time I'm just so happy that I ever found you
Its a complicated web
That you weave inside my head
So much pleasure with such pain
We always always stay the same

I'm feeling the way you cross my mind
And you save me in the knick of time
I'm riding the highs I'm digging the lows
Cuz at least I feel alive
I never faced so many emotional days
But my life is good I'm feeling you
I'm feeling you

[Verse 2]
You go and then I can finally breath in
Cuz baby I know in the end you're never leaving
Well we rarely ever sane
I drive you crazy and you do the same
But your fire fills my soul
And it warms me up like no one knows

Let's show 'em some love!
Welcome to Detroit!

[Chorus: Eminem]
Where's my gangstas and all my thugs?
Throw them hands up and show some love
And I welcome you to Detroit city
I said welcome to Detroit city
Every place, everywhere we go
Man, we deep everywhere we roll
Ask around and they all know Tricky
Ask what's good, man, they all say Tricky

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Click click boom, just as soon as we hit the room
You can hear 'em holla ""Goon Sqwad!"" in this bitch
Let me hear you holla ""Goon Sqwad!"" in this bitch
Let me hear you holla ""Runyon Ave!"" in this bitch
So who am I gonna call on when I ain't got them boys with me
And the situation gets a little sticky?
I'ma dial 911 like a motherfuckin' punk
Fuck that, bla bla, I'ma call that rude boy from Detroit
Trick Trick, quick, come pick me up!
Bring them guns, come to the club, meet me out front
There's some chump up in this bitch
Poppin' some junk ‘cause he's drunk
And we may have to fuck his ass up
‘Cause uh, somethin' smells a lil fishy
And I don't like the way his boys keep lookin' at me
So homie, come get me, Wonder Boys, what up doe, I see you
Rock Bottom, yeah I see you, all my Detroit people
Where you at? Man, let me see them hands in the sky
Detroit, motherfuckers, till we die

[Chorus: Eminem]
Where's my gangstas and all my thugs?
Throw them hands up and show some love
And I welcome you to Detroit city
I said welcome to Detroit city
Every place, everywhere we go
Man, we deep everywhere we roll
Ask around and they all know Tricky
Ask what's good, man, they all say Tricky

[Verse 2: Trick Trick]
Homie, it's been a long time comin' and I'm straight with that
Marshall done called me to five-four and laced the track
This beat, you hear it bangin', he produced it himself
My bad, almost forgot to introduce myself
My name is Trick Trick, head of the Goon Sqwad and gangsta
Been bangin' the underground since ninety-five, we're bangin'
Elected to be the villain and certified a menace
Holdin' it down since I paroled up outta prison
You heard about me, you just didn't know it was me
All the treacherous, evil deeds of the D you never see
Pickin' that kid up in the game, I just wasn't chasin' the fame
I been chasin' the paper product and givin' lames the pain
Accusations of violence, you know you done heard of that
A quarter of a million dollars for beatin' a murder rap
And my boy holdin' me up, Shady done put it out
Trick Trick and Eminem, Detroit back in the house

[Chorus: Eminem]
Where's my gangstas and all my thugs?
Throw them hands up and show some love
And I welcome you to Detroit city
I said welcome to Detroit city
Every place, everywhere we go
Man, we deep everywhere we roll
Ask around and they all know Tricky
Ask what's good, man, they all say Tricky

[Verse 3: Trick Trick]
Ayo Em, you ever need one of these weapons, come get it
From now on every beef that you get in, homie, I'm in it
I been ridin' for this city, whether wrong or right
I been whippin' on motherfuckers for the longest time
So it's evident, it's time for Trick to get it fast
The public, see, they appreciate my criminal past
Authorities tried to stop me, but they couldn't keep up
Got a fan-base that's bigger then an average star
I'm satisfied with it being my time to shine
And I freak from the precinct for violent crimes
I ain't sayin' the shit that I'm sayin' so girls can feel me
Only speakin' on what I know so the world can hear me
So peace to Jimmy and Dre for signin' my nigga
He reached back to Detroit and grabbed a winner
So the gangstas and thugs, we embrace with love
And beat the hell outta anybody that fucks with us

[Chorus: Eminem]
Where's my gangstas and all my thugs?
Throw them hands up and show some love
And I welcome you to Detroit city
I said welcome to Detroit city
Every place, everywhere we go
Man, we deep everywhere we roll
Ask around and they all know Tricky
Ask what's good, man, they all say Tricky

[Outro: Trick Trick & Eminem]
Yeah, Trick Trick
Eminem, Wonder boy, Shady
It's going down, baby
Ayo Em, I got yo' back, my nigga
Damn right I said ""my nigga""
That's my nigga
Tricky
I pull this mothafucka' out right here
Mothafuckas' don't wanna talk out no more
Niggas come out with them nines and shit
When I come back this mothafucka'
And crack them bitch one good time
Niggas don't wanna talk no more, neutral
Hell nah, every time, please believe it
The mothafucka' said it right there
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Welcome to Detroit
Come back soon
Sorry we missed you

115,115,Behind These Hazel Eyes,"[Verse 1]
Seems like just yesterday
You were a part of me
I used to stand so tall
I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight
Everything, it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothing could go wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hangin' on

[Chorus]
Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

[Verse 2]
I told you everything
Opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright for once in my life
Now all that's left of me
Is what I pretend to be
So together, but so broken up inside

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hangin' on

[Chorus]
Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

[Bridge]
Swallow me then spit me out
For hating you, I blame myself
Seeing you, it kills me now
No, I don't cry on the outside
Anymore
Anymore

[Chorus]
Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes
Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes","['seem', 'like', 'just', 'yesterday', 'you', 'be', 'a', 'part', 'of', 'me', 'i', 'use', 'to', 'stand', 'so', 'tall', 'i', 'use', 'to', 'be', 'so', 'strong', 'your', 'arm', 'around', 'me', 'tight', 'everything', 'it', 'felt', 'so', 'right', 'unbreakable', 'like', 'nothing', 'could', 'go', 'wrong', 'now', 'i', 'cant', 'breathe', 'no', 'i', 'cant', 'sleep', 'im', 'barely', 'hangin', 'on', 'here', 'i', 'be', 'once', 'again', 'im', 'tear', 'into', 'piece', 'cant', 'deny', 'it', 'cant', 'pretend', 'just', 'think', 'you', 'be', 'the', 'one', 'break', 'up', 'deep', 'inside', 'but', 'you', 'wont', 'get', 'to', 'see', 'the', 'tear', 'i', 'cry', 'behind', 'these', 'hazel', 'eye', 'i', 'tell', 'you', 'everything', 'open', 'up', 'and', 'let', 'you', 'in', 'you', 'make', 'me', 'feel', 'alright', 'for', 'once', 'in', 'my', 'life', 'now', 'all', 'thats', 'leave', 'of', 'me', 'be', 'what', 'i', 'pretend', 'to', 'be', 'so', 'together', 'but', 'so', 'break', 'up', 'inside', 'cause', 'i', 'cant', 'breathe', 'no', 'i', 'cant', 'sleep', 'im', 'barely', 'hangin', 'on', 'here', 'i', 'be', 'once', 'again', 'im', 'tear', 'into', 'piece', 'cant', 'deny', 'it', 'cant', 'pretend', 'just', 'think', 'you', 'be', 'the', 'one', 'break', 'up', 'deep', 'inside', 'but', 'you', 'wont', 'get', 'to', 'see', 'the', 'tear', 'i', 'cry', 'behind', 'these', 'hazel', 'eye', 'swallow', 'me', 'then', 'spit', 'me', 'out', 'for', 'hat', 'you', 'i', 'blame', 'myself', 'see', 'you', 'it', 'kill', 'me', 'now', 'no', 'i', 'dont', 'cry', 'on', 'the', 'outside', 'anymore', 'anymore', 'here', 'i', 'be', 'once', 'again', 'im', 'tear', 'into', 'piece', 'cant', 'deny', 'it', 'cant', 'pretend', 'just', 'think', 'you', 'be', 'the', 'one', 'break', 'up', 'deep', 'inside', 'but', 'you', 'wont', 'get', 'to', 'see', 'the', 'tear', 'i', 'cry', 'behind', 'these', 'hazel', 'eye', 'here', 'i', 'be', 'once', 'again', 'im', 'tear', 'into', 'piece', 'cant', 'deny', 'it', 'cant', 'pretend', 'just', 'think', 'you', 'be', 'the', 'one', 'break', 'up', 'deep', 'inside', 'but', 'you', 'wont', 'get', 'to', 'see', 'the', 'tear', 'i', 'cry', 'behind', 'these', 'hazel', 'eye']",280,Kelly Clarkson,Kelly Clarkson,2005,"[42, 40, 38, 34, 31, 26, 22, 20, 23, 20, 16, 17, 13, 9, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 18, 24, 38, 46, 65, 87]",34,Behind These Hazel Eyes,https://open.spotify.com/track/0AKAxdNkwq9ZxRdW1DN9zW,0AKAxdNkwq9ZxRdW1DN9zW,spotify:track:0AKAxdNkwq9ZxRdW1DN9zW,Breakaway,5gDAEao3VxFdbm8vS0koQq,spotify:album:5gDAEao3VxFdbm8vS0koQq,Kelly Clarkson,3BmGtnKgCSGYIUhmivXKWX,spotify:artist:3BmGtnKgCSGYIUhmivXKWX,198.97299999999998,12.0,58.0,2004-01-17,0.5479999999999999,0.889,9.0,-4.6819999999999995,1.0,0.0382,0.00165,0.00109,0.19699999999999998,0.425,90.04799999999999,"['dance pop', 'neo mellow', 'pop', 'pop rock', 'post-teen pop', 'talent show', 'urban contemporary']",[],1.0

She's cold and she's cruel
But she knows what she's doing
She pushed me in the pool
At our last school reunion
She laughs at my dreams
But I dream about her laughter
Strange as it seems
She's the one I'm after

[Chorus]
'Cause she's bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself
I don't want anyone else
She's a mystery
She's too much for me
But I keep coming back for more
She's just the girl I'm looking for

[Verse 2]
She can't keep a secret
For more than an hour
She runs on 100 proof attitude power
And the more she ignores me
The more I adore her
What can I do?
I'd do anything for her

[Chorus]
'Cause she's bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself
I don't want anyone else
She's a mystery
She's too much for me
But I keep coming back for more
She's just the girl I'm looking for

[Bridge]
And when she sees it's me
On her caller ID
She won't pick up the phone
She'd rather be alone
But I can't give up just yet
'Cause every word she's ever said
Is still ringing in my head
Still ringing in my head
She's cold and she's cruel
But she knows what she's doing
Knows just what to say
So my whole day is ruined

[Chorus]
'Cause she's bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself
I don't want anyone else
She's a mystery
She's too much for me
But I keep coming back for more
'Cause she's bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself
I don't want anyone else
She's a mystery
She's too much for me
But I keep coming back for more
Oh, I keep coming back for more
She's just the girl I'm looking for

I'm meetin' my buddies out on the lake
We're headed out to a special place we love
That just a few folks know
There's no signin' up, no monthly dues
Take your Johnson, your Mercury
Or your Evinrude an' fire it up
Meet us out at party cove
Come on in the water's fine
Just idle on over an' toss us a line

Bass-trackers, Bayliners and a party barge
Strung together like a floatin' trailer park
Anchored out and gettin' loud all summer long
Side by side, there's five houseboat front porches
Astroturf, lawn chairs and tiki torches
Regular Joes rockin' the boat, that's us

Bermuda's, flip-flops and a tank-top tan
He popped his first top at 10 a.m., that's Bob
He's our president
We're checkin' out the girls on the upper deck
Rubbin' in the 15 SPF, it's hot
Everybody's jumpin' in
Later on when the sun goes down
We'll pull out the jar and that old guitar
An' pass 'em around

Good is good and bad is bad
But you don't know which one you had
She put your books out on the sidewalk
Now they're blowin' 'round
They won't help you when you're down

Love's on your list of things to do
To bring your good luck back to you
And if you think that everything's unfair
Would you care if you're the last one standing there

And every time you hear the rolling thunder
You turn around before the lightning strikes
And does it ever make you stop and wonder
If all your good times pass you by

But I can show you how to turn the key
'Cause all I know is where I started
Is so downhearted, that's not where you want to be

You turn around before the lightning strikes
And you could find a rock to crawl right under
And let your good times pass you by

Won't even bother now to tell me why
You come alone, letting all of us savor the moment
Leaving me broken another time
You come on like a bloodstained hurricane
Leave me alone, let me be this time
You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption
I don't want to mention, the reason I know

[Chorus]
That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss will I run

[Verse 2]
You don't know what your power has done to me
I want to know if I'll heal inside
I can't go on with a holocaust about to happen
Seeing you laughing another time
You'll never know why your face has haunted me
My very soul has to bleed this time
Another hole in the wall of my inner defenses
Leaving me breathless, the reason I know

[Chorus]
That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss will I run
Into the abyss will I run

[Verse 1]
You walk on like a woman in suffering
Won't even bother now to tell me why

Into the abyss will I run

[Outro]
Into the abyss will I run
I can't let you go

I beg your pardon I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine there's got to be a little rain sometime
When you take you got to give so live and let live and let go oh oh oh oh
I beg your pardon I never promised you a rose garden

[Verse 1]
I could promise you things like big diamond rings
But you don't find roses growing on stalks of clover
So you better think it over
Well, if sweet talking you could make it come true
I would give you the world right now on a silver platter
But what would it matter

[Chorus 2]
So smile for a while and let's be jolly love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon
But if that's what it takes to hold you I'd just as soon let you go
But there's one thing I want you to know
You'd better look before you leap still waters run deep
And there won't always be someone there to pull you out
And you know what I'm talking about

123,123,La Tortura,"[Intro: Alejandro Sanz]
Hey baby, save the poetry
Keep your happiness to yourself

[Verse 1: Shakira & Alejandro Sanz]
I don't ask for every day to be sunny
I don't ask for there to be a party every Friday
Nor do I ask that you return to me begging for forgiveness
If you cry with dry eyes
Talking about her
Oh, my love, it hurts me so much (it hurts me so much)
That you left without telling me where you were going
Oh, my love, it was torture to lose you

[Chorus: Shakira & Alejandro Sanz]
I know I haven't been a saint
But I can fix it, love
Man cannot live on bread alone
And I cannot live off of excuses
We only learn from mistakes
And today I know that my heart is yours
It's best if you save all that
Throw that bone to another dog
And we'll say goodbye

[Verse 2: Shakira & Alejandro Sanz]
I can't ask winter to pardon a rose
I can't ask the elm trees to bear pears
I can't ask eternity from a mere mortal
And walk around throwing thousands of pearls to the pigs
Oh, my love, it hurts so much, it hurts so much
That you don't believe in my promises anymore
Oh, my love, it's torture to lose you

[Chorus: Shakira & Alejandro Sanz]
I know I haven't been a saint
But I can fix it, love
Man cannot live on bread alone
And I cannot live off of excuses
We only learn from mistakes
And today I know that my heart is yours
It's best if you save all that
Throw that bone to another dog
And we'll say goodbye

[Bridge: Alejandro Sanz]
Don't leave, don't leave
Hey, baby, look, don't get angry
You have my love from Monday to Friday
But it's best if you leave Saturday to me
Hey, baby, don't punish me any more
Because out there, without you, I can't find peace
I'm just a repentant man
I'm like a bird that returns to its nest

[Chorus: Shakira & Alejandro Sanz]
I know I haven't been a saint
I'm not made of stone
Man cannot live on bread alone
And I cannot live off of excuses
We only learn from mistakes
And today I know that my heart is yours

[Outro: Shakira]
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Oh, all that I've done for you
It was torture to lose you

Got a date a week from Friday
With the preacher's son
Everybody says he's crazy
I'll have to see
I finally moved to Jackson
When the summer came
I won't have to pay that boy to rake my leaves
I'm probably going on and on
It seems I'm doing more of that these days

[Chorus]
I probably wouldn't be this way
I probably wouldn't hurt so bad
I never pictured every minute without you in it
Oh, you left so fast
Sometimes I see you standing there
Sometimes it's like I'm losing touch
Sometimes I feel that I'm so lucky
To have had the chance to love this much
God gave me a moment's grace
Cause if I'd never seen your face
I probably wouldn't be this way

[Verse 2]
Mama says that I just shouldn't speak to you
Susan says that I should just move on
You oughta see the way these people look at me
When they see me 'round here talking to this stone
Everybody thinks I've lost my mind
But I just take it day by day

Oooh I need you
Like the fire needs the air
I won't burn unless you're there, you're there
Oooh I need you

[Intro - over Sample]
Yeah, I need you, I need you to hate
So I can use you for your energy
You know, it's real shit, feel this

[Verse 1]
America got a thing for this gangster shit, they love me
Black Chukkas, black skully, leather Pelle Pelle
I tag SPIT over Ramo's shit, I'm a vandal
Got that silver duct tape on my trey-eight handle
The women in my life bring confusion and shit
So like Nino in ""New Jack,"" I holla ""Cancel that bitch!""
Look at me, this is the life I chose
Niggas around me so cold, man my heart done froze
I built an empire on the low, the NARC's don't know
I'm the weatherman, I take that cocoa leaf and make that snow
Sit back, watch it turn to dope, watch it go out the do'
O after O, you know?
Homie, I'm just triple beam, dreaming, niggas be scheming
I fiend to live the good life, the fiends are just fiendin'
Conceal my weapon nice and neat so you can't see
The penitentiary is definitely out the question for me

[Chorus]
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)
Nigga, you get in my way while I'm trying to get mine
And I'll buck you (Buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga, fuck you (Fuck you)
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I don't know shit about gymnastics, I somersault bricks
And black talons start flying when a nigga flip
I cook crack in the microwave, niggas can't fuck with me
Man my co-d's call me Chef Boyar-50
Check my logic, smokers don't like seeds in they weed, shit
Send me them seeds, I'll grow them what they need
Them ain't Chia pet plants in the crib, that's chronic
And I'm selling them for 500 a pop, goddamn it
I sell anything I'm a hustler, I know how to grind
Step on grapes, put it in water and tell you it's wine
If you analyze me, what you will find
Is the DNA of a crook and what goes on in my mind
Is contagious, hypnotic, it sounds melodic
If rap was the block or a spot, I'd be that potent product
Now get a load of me, flashy, far from low key
And you can locate me wherever that dope be
Getting money man

[Chorus]
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)
Nigga, you get in my way while I'm trying to get mine
And I'll buck you (Buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga, fuck you (Fuck you)
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)

[Verse 3]
It's the Hustler's Ambition, close your eyes, listen see my vision
Mossberg pumpin', shotgun dumpin'
The drama means nothing, it's part of the game
Catch me in the coupé switching lanes or in the jeweler switching chains
I upgrade from dirty ""BS"" to clean VS
Rocks that I copped from proceeds from the spot
I got the energy to win, I'm full of adrenaline
Play the curb and get nauseous, watching the spinners spin
I made plans to make it, a prisoner of the state
Now I can invite your ass out to my estate
Them hollow tips bent me up, but I'm back in shape
Pour Cristal in the blender, make a protein shake
I'm like the East coast number one playboy B
Hugh Hefner'll tell you he ain't got shit on me
The feds watch me, icey, they can't stop me
Racist, pointing at me, ""Look at Niggaraci"" - hello

I want the finer things in my life

Billys at the bar, he's been there all night
First ten beers hes had, since her goodbye
HEY! HEY!

She left him broke, in his new truck
He don't smoke, but he lights one up
Temporary fix, for his heartache
Hes hurting bad, but hes feeling great

Hes on the dance floor yelling Freebird
Singing off pitch but he knows every word
Grabs him a girl and he holds on tight
Hes chasing everything in sight
Hell fall apart when he gets home
But right now his worries are gone
Life looks good, good, good
Billys got his beer goggles on
Hey!

Lot of drunks, get real mean
Theyll pick a fight, over anything
Billy wants to laugh, that's why hes here
You won't see him cry, unless you spill his beer

Hes on the dance floor yelling Freebird
Singing off pitch but he knows every word
Grabs him another girl and he holds on tight
Now hes chasing everything in sight
Hell fall apart when he gets home
Right now his worries are gone
Life looks good, good, good
Billy's got his beer goggles.....on

Hes on the dance floor yelling Freebird
Singing off pitch but he knows every word
Grabs him another girl he hold on tight
He don't see ugly
Through blood shot eyes

So good, good, good

It's hard to remember how it felt before
Now I found the love of my life
Passes things, get more comfortable
Everything is going right

[Chorus 1]
And after all the obstacles
It's good to see you now with someone else
And it's such a miracle that you and me are still good friends
After all that we've been through
I know we're cool
I know we're cool

[Verse 2]
We used to think it was impossible
Now you call me by my new last name
Memories seem like so long ago
Time always kills the pain

[Chorus 2]
Remember Harbor Boulevard
The dreaming days where the mess was made
Look how all the kids have grown
We have changed, but we're still the same
After all that we've been through
I know we're cool
I know we're cool
Yeah, I know we're cool

[Chorus 3]
And I'll be happy for you
If you can be happy for me
Circles and triangles
And now we're hangin' out with your new girlfriend
So far from where we've been
I know we're cool
I know we're cool

[50 Cent]
You do you man cause me I'm 'gon do my thing, you know I do my thing
I'mma get my drink on and party like it's ok

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Trust me man it's ok, bounce with me in slow mo
When they hear the kid in the house they're like, ""Oh no""
50 got 'em locin again, they open again
Got 'em sipping on that juice and gin
You could find me in the background burning that Backwood
Styling and stunting, doing my two step fronting
Now I'mma tell you what Em told me, homey
Just lose the parental discretion's advised, this is grown folk music
Now blend in with me, as I proceed to break it down
It's always off the chain man when I'm around
I play the block bumping, it was all for the dough
I get the club jumping, cause I'm sick with flow
You know it's sold out, like wherever I go
I jam packed the show man that's for sure
I got the info you already know
Man I get it popping in the club, everybody show me love, let's go

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now shorty let's get into it
You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now homey let's get into it

[Verse 2: Havoc]
You wanna search me for certain but hurry up cause I'm thirsty
I need that, grind in my system P, on my side twisting
In the club today for the chick to go both
Ways, let me see that ID just for proof
With the drink til the burn is gone
Hit the dancefloor like a scene from soft porn
Before it pop, make em sign a disclaimer
Try to get me on some Pac shit these tricks will frame ya
But, in any event, keep fucking with 50 it makes sense
Cents, into them dollars, the hoes wanna holler
But you lookin at a nigga that done came from the squalor
Now my buddy so gone I can pop your collar
Now If I don’t say nothin, let me see you swallow
In my crib got the co-ed back the new problem
In the club feed them liquor of the wise I'm starving
So much green gettin twisted like Botanical Garden, let's go

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now shorty let's get into it
You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control
Quit playing turn the music up a little bit
Bounce with me now homey let's get into it

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
You already know how it go, I bang, I shine
I play, I stay I'm going for mine
I'm young, I'm black, I'm rich and yes
I'm ghetto than the motherfucking project steps
I'm cool, I'm calm you looking real stressed
I'm strapped I'm armed kid, hold your head
I'm known for gat popping, when I got problems
I don't run, I just gun you all up
But we ain't come here to start no drama
We just looking for our future baby mamas
With money with face with style and body
I cook I clean I swear that mami
Just as long as you don't go off and tell nobody
I go down low, I'm lying I'm trying my best to let you know
Sugar pop get at P
The Doc beat make it easy to get 'em in the bed sheets

I walk the streets of Japan 'til I get lost
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
With a graveyard tan carrying a cross
Yeah it doesn't remind me of anything
I like studying faces in parking lot
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
I like drivin' backwards in the fog
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything

[Chorus 1]
The things that I've loved, things that I've lost
Things I've held sacred that I've dropped
I won't lie no more you can bet
I don't wanna learn what I'll need to forget

[Verse 2]
I like gypsy moths and radio talk
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
I like gospel music and canned applause
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
I like colorful clothing in the sun
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything
I like hammering nails and speaking in tongues
'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything

[Chorus 2]
The things that I've loved, things that I've lost
Things I've held sacred that I've dropped
I won't lie no more you can bet
Don't wanna learn what I'll need...

[Bridge]
Bend and shape me I love the way you are
Slow and sweetly like never before
Calm and sleeping we won't stir up the past
So discreetly we won't look back

Things I've held sacred that I've dropped

134,134,Stay With Me (Brass Bed),"Tale of King Omar Bin Al-Nu'uman and His Sons Sharrkan and Zau Al-Makan

And What Befel Them of Things Seld-Seen and Peregrine.[FN#138]

The King asked her, ""And what was their story?"" and she answered: It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that there was in the City of Safety, Baghdad, before the Caliphate of Abd al-Malik bin Marwán,[FN#139] a King, Omar bin al-Nu'umán highs, who was of the mighty giants and had subjected the Chosroës of Persia and the Kaysars of Eastern Rome; for none could warm himself at his fire;[FN#140] nor could any avail to meet him in the field of foray and fray; and, when he was angered, there came forth from his nostrils sparks of flame. He had made himself King over all quarters, and Allah had subjected to him all His creatures; his word went forth to all great cities and his hosts had harried the farthest lands. East and West had come under his command with whatsoever regions lay interspersed between them, Hind and Sind and Sin,[FN#141] the Holy Land, Al-Hijaz, the rich mountains of Al-Yaman and the archipelagos of India and China. Moreover, he reigned supreme over the north country and Diyár Bakr, or Mesopotamia, and over Sudán, the Eastern Negro land and the Islands of the Ocean, and all the far famed rivers of the earth, Sayhún and Jayhún,[FN#142] Nile and Euphrates. He sent envoys and ambassadors to capitals the most remote, to provide him with true report; and they would bring back tidings of justice and peace, with assurance of loyalty and obedience and of prayers in the pulpits for King Omar bin al-Nu'uman; for he was, O Ruler of the Age, a right noble King; and there came to him presents of rarities and toll and tribute from all lands of his governing. This mighty monarch had a son yclept Sharrkan,[FN#143] who was likest of all men to his father and who proved himself one of the prodigies of his time for subduing the brave and bringing his contemporaries to bane and ban. For this his father loved him with love so great none could be greater, and made him heir to the kingdom after himself. This Prince grew up till he reached man's estate and was twenty years old, and Allah subjected His servants to him, by reason of his great might and prowess in battle. Now his father, King Omar, had four wives legally married, but Allah had vouchsafed him no son by them, save Sharrkan, whom he had begotten upon one of them, and the rest were barren. Moreover he had three hundred and sixty concubines, after the number of days in the Coptic year, who were of all nations; and he had furnished for each and every a private chamber within his own palace. For he had built twelve pavilions, after the number of the months, each containing thirty private chambers, which thus numbered three hundred and three score, wherein he lodged his handmaids: and he appointed according to law for each one her night, when he lay with her and came not again to her for a full year;[FN#144] and on this wise he abode for a length of time. Meanwhile his son Sharrkan was making himself renowned in all quarters of the world and his father was proud of him and his might waxed and grew mightier; so that he passed all bounds and bore himself masterfully and took by storm castles and cities. Presently, by decree of the Decreer, a handmaid among the handmaids of Omar bin Nu'uman became pregnant; and, her pregnancy being announced to the Harim, the King was informed thereof; whereupon he rejoiced with exceeding joy and said, ""Haply it will be a son, and so all my offspring will be males!"" Then he documented the date of her conception and entreated her with all manner of kindness. But when the tidings came to Sharrkan, he was troubled and the matter seemed to him a sore one and a grievous; and he said, ""Verily one cometh who shall dispute with me the sovereignty:"" so quoth he to himself, ""If this concubine bear a male child I will kill it:"" but he kept that intention hidden in his heart. Such was the case with Sharrkan; but what happened in the matter of the damsel was as follows. She was a Roumiyah, a Greek girl, by name Sofiyah or Sophia,[FN#145] whom the King of Roum and Lord of Cæsarea had sent to King Omar as a present, together with great store of gifts and of rarities: she was the fairest of favour and loveliest of all his handmaids and the most regardful of her honour; and she was gifted with a wit as penetrating as her presence was fascinating. Now she had served the King on the night of his sleeping with her, saying to him, ""O King! I desire of the God of the Heavens that he bless thee this night with a male child by me, so I may bring him up with the best of rearing, and enable him to reach man's estate perfect in intelligence, good manners and prudent bearing""[FN#146]—a speech which much pleased the King. During her pregnancy she was instant in prayer, fervently supplicating the Lord to bless her with a goodly male child and make his birth easy to her; and Allah heard her petition so that after her months were accomplished she sat safely upon the birth stool.[FN#147] Now the King had deputed a eunuch to let him know if the child she should bring forth were male or female; and in like way his son Sharrkan had sent one to bring him tidings of the same. In due time Sophia was delivered of a child, which the midwives examined and found to be a girl with a face sheenier than the moon. So they announced this to all present in the room, whereupon the King's messenger carried the news to him; and Sharrkan's eunuch did the like with his master who rejoiced with exceeding joy. But, after the two had departed, quoth Sophia to the midwives, ""Wait with me awhile, for I feel as if there were still somewhat in my womb."" Then she cried out and the pains of child bed again took her; and Allah made it easy to her and she gave birth to a second child. The wise women looked at it and found it a boy like the full moon, with forehead flower white, and cheek ruddy bright with rosy light; whereupon the mother rejoiced, as did the eunuchs and attendants and all the company; and Sophia was delivered of the after birth whilst all in the palace sent forth the trill of joy.[FN#148] The rest of the concubines heard it and envied her lot; and the tidings reached Omar son of Al- Nu'uman, who was glad and rejoiced at the excellent news. Then he rose and went to her and kissed her head, after which he looked at the boy; and, bending over him, kissed him, whilst the damsels struck the tabors and played on instruments of music; and the King gave order that the boy should be named Zau al-Makán and his sister Nuzhat al-Zamán.[FN#149] They answered ""Hearing and obedience,"" and did his bidding; so he appointed wet nurses and dry nurses and eunuchs and attendants to serve them; and assigned them rations of sugar and diet drinks and unguents and else beside, beyond the power of tongue to rehearse. Moreover the people of Baghdad, hearing that Allah had blessed their King with issue, decorated the city and made proclamation of the glad tidings with drum and tom tom; and the Emirs and Wazirs and high dignitaries came to the palace and wished King Omar bin al-Nu'uman joy of his son, Zau al-Makan, and of his daughter Nuzhat al-Zaman, wherefore he thanked them and bestowed on them dresses of honour and further favoured them with gifts, and dealt largesse to all, gentle and simple, who were present. After this fashion he did for four days full told, and he lavished upon Sophia raiment and ornaments and great store of wealth; and, every few days he would send a messenger to ask after her and the new-borns. And when four years had gone by, he provided her with the wherewithal to rear the two children carefully and educate them with the best of instructions. All this while his son Sharrkan knew not that a male child had been born to his father, Omar son of Al-Nu'uman, having news only that he had been blessed with the birth of Nuzhat al-Zaman; and they hid the intelligence from him, until days and years had sped by, whilst he was busied in battling with the brave and fighting single handed against the knights. One day, as King Omar was sitting in his palace, his Chamberlains came in to him and, kissing the ground before him, said, ""O King there be come Ambassadors from the King of Roum, Lord of Constantinople the Great, and they desire admission to thee and submission to thy decree: if the King commend us to introduce them we will so do; and, if not, there is no disputing his behest."" He bade them enter and, when they came in, he turned to them and, courteously receiving them, asked them of their case, and what was the cause of their coming. They kissed the ground before him and said, ""O King glorious and strong! O lord of the arm that is long! know that he who despatched us to thee is King Afrídún,[FN#150] Lord of Ionia land[FN#151] and of the Nazarene armies, the sovereign who is firmly established in the empery of Constantinople, to acquaint thee that he is now waging fierce war and fell with a tyrant and a rebel, the Prince of Casarea; and the cause of this war is as follows. One of the Kings of the Arabs in past time, during certain of his conquests, chanced upon a hoard of the time of Alexander,[FN#152] whence he removed wealth past compute; and, amongst other things, three round jewels, big as ostrich eggs, from a mine of pure white gems whose like was never seen by man. Upon each were graven characts in Ionian characters, and they have many virtues and properties, amongst the rest that if one of these jewels be hung round the neck of a new-born child, no evil shall befal him and he shall neither wail, nor shall fever ail him as long as the jewel remain without fail.[FN#153] When the Arab King laid hands upon them and learned their secrets, he sent to King Afridun presents of certain rarities and amongst them the three jewels afore mentioned; and he equipped for the mission two ships, one bearing the treasure and the other men of might to guard it from any who might offer hindrance on the high seas, albeit well assured that none would dare waylay his vessels, for that he was King of the Arabs, and more by token that their course lay over waters subject to the King of Constantinople and they were bound to his port; nor were there on the shores of that sea any save the subjects of the Great King, Afridun. The two ships set out and voyaged till they drew near our city, when there sallied out on them certain corsairs from that country and amongst them troops from the Prince of Caesarea, who took all the treasures and rarities in the ships, together with the three jewels, and slew the crews. When our King heard of this, he sent an army against them, but they routed it; then he marched a second and a stronger but they put this also to flight,—whereupon the King waxed wroth and swore that he would not go forth[FN#154] against them save in his own person at the head of his whole army; nor would he turn back from them till he had left Caesarea, of Armenia[FN#155] in ruins and had laid waste all the lands and cities over which her Prince held sway. So he sent us to the Lord of the age and the time, Sultan Omar bin al-Nu'uman, King of Baghdad and of Khorasan, desiring that he aid us with an army, so may honour and glory accrue to him; and he hath also forwarded by us somewhat of various kinds of presents, and of the King's grace he beggeth their acceptance and the friendly boon of furtherance."" Then the Ambassadors kissed the ground before him,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Forty-sixth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that, after the Ambassadors and retinue from the Constantinopolitan King had kissed the ground before Omar and had delivered their embassage, they brought out the presents, which were fifty damsels of the choicest from Graecia-land, and fifty Mamelukes in tunics of brocade, belted with girdles of gold and silver, each wearing in his ears hoops of gold with pendants of fine pearls costing a thousand ducats every one. The girls were adorned in like fashion and were clad in stuffs worth a treasury of money. When the King saw them, he rejoiced in them and accepted them; then he bade the Ambassadors be honourably entreated and, summoning his Wazirs, took counsel with them of what he should do. Herewith rose up among them a Wazir, an ancient man, Dandan[FN#156] highs, who kissed the ground before Omar and said, ""O King, there is nothing better to do in this matter than equip an army valiant and victorious, and set over it thy son Sharrkan with us as his lieutenants; and this rede commendeth itself to me on two counts; first, because the King of Roum hath invoked thine assistance and hath sent thee gifts which thou hast accepted; and, secondly, because while no enemy dareth attack our country, thine army may go forth safely and, should it succour the King of Graecia-land and defeat his foe, the glory will be thine. Moreover, the news of it will be noised abroad in all cities and countries and especially, when the tidings shall reach the Islands of the Ocean and the Kings of Mauritania shall hear it, they will send thee offerings of rarities and pay thee tribute of money."" The King pleased by the Wazir's words and approving his rede, gave him a dress of honour and said to him, ""Of the like of thee should Kings ask counsel, and it seemeth fit that thou shouldst conduct the van of our army and our son Sharrkan command the main battle."" Then he sent for his son who came and kissed ground before him and sat down; and he expounded to him the matter, telling him what the Ambassadors and the Wazir Dandan had said, and he charged him to take arms and equip himself for the campaign, enjoining him not to gainsay Dandan in aught he should do. Moreover, he ordered him to pick out of his army ten thousand horsemen, armed cap-à-pie and inured to onset and stress of war. Accordingly, Sharrkan arose on the instant, and chose out a myriad of horsemen, after which he entered his palace and mustered his host and distributed largesse to them, saying, ""Ye have delay of three days."" They kissed the earth before him in obedience to his commands and began at once to lay in munitions, and provide provisions for the occasion; whilst Sharrkan repaired to the armouries and took therefrom whatsoever he required of arms and armour, and thence to the stable where he chose horses of choice blood and others. When the appointed three days were ended, the army drew out to the suburbs of Baghdad city;[FN#157] and King Omar came forth to take leave of his son who kissed the ground before him and received from the King seven parcels of money.[FN#158] Then he turned to Danden and commended to his care the army of his son; and the Wazir kissed the ground before him and answered, ""I hear and I obey;"" and lastly he charged Sharrkan that he should consult the Wazir on all occasions, which he promised to do. After this, the King returned to his city and Sharrkan ordered the officers to muster their troops in battle array. So they mustered them and their number was ten thousand horsemen, besides footmen and camp followers. Then they loaded their baggage on their beasts and the war drums beat and the trumpets blared and the bannerols and standards were unfurled, whilst Sharrkan mounted horse, with the Wazir Dandan by his side, and the colours fluttering over their heads. So the host fared forth and stinted not faring, with the ambassadors preceding them, till day departed and night drew nigh, when they alighted and encamped for the night. And as soon as Allah caused the morn tomorrow, they mounted and tried on, guided by the Ambassadors, for a space of twenty days; and by the night of the twenty first they came to a fine and spacious Wady well grown with trees and shrubbery. Here Sharrkan ordered them to alight and commanded a three days' halt, so they dismounted and pitched their tents, spreading their camp over the right and the left slopes of the extensive valley, whilst the Wazir Dandan and the Ambassadors of King Afridun pitched in the sole of the Wady.[FN#159] As for Sharrkan, he tarried behind them for awhile till all had dismounted and had dispersed themselves over the valley sides; he then slacked the reins of his steed, being minded to explore the Wady and to mount guard in his own person, because of his father's charge and owing to the fact that they were on the frontier of Graecia land and in the enemy's country. So he rode out alone after ordering his armed slaves and his body guard to camp near the Wazir Dandan, and he fared on along the side of the valley till a fourth part of the night was passed, when he felt tired and drowsiness overcame him, so that he could no longer urge horse with heel. Now he was accustomed to take rest on horseback; so when slumber overpowered him, he slept and the steed ceased not going on with him till half the night was spent and entered one of the thickets[FN#160] which was dense with growth; but Sharrkan awoke not until his horse stumbled over wooded ground. Then he started from sleep and found himself among the trees, and the moon arose and shone brightly over the two horizons, Eastern and Western. He was startled when he found himself alone in this place and said the say which ne'er yet shamed its sayer, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!"" But as he rode on, in fear of wild beasts, behold, the moon spread her glad light over a meadow as if it were of the meads of Paradise; and he heard pleasant voices and a loud noise of talk and laughter captivating the senses of men. So King Sharrkan alighted and, tying his steed to one of the trees, went over a little way till he came upon a stream and heard a woman talking in Arabic and saying, ""Now by the crush of the Messiah, this is not well of you! but whose utters a word, I will throw her and truss her up with her own girdle[FN#161]!"" He kept walking in the direction of the sound and when he reached the further side he looked and behold, a stream was gushing and flowing, and antelopes at large were frisking and roving, and wild cattle amid the pasture moving, and birds expressed joy and gladness in their divers tongues, and that place was purfled with all manner flowers and green herbs, even as a poet described it in these couplets,

""Most beautiful is earth in budding bloom, * When lucid waters
            course through plain and wood:
No work but His th' All great, th' All glorious, * Giver of all
            gifts, Giver of all good!""

And as Sharrkan considered the place, he saw in it a Christian Monastery within whose enceinte a castle towered high in air catching the light of the moon.[FN#162] Through the midst of the convent passed a stream, the water flowing amongst its gardens; and upon the bank sat the woman whose voice he had heard, while before her stood ten handmaids like moons and wearing various sorts of raiment and ornaments that dazed and dazzled the beholder, high bosomed virgins, as saith of them the poet in these couplets,

""The mead is bright with what is on't * Of merry maidens
            debonnair:
Double its beauty and its grace * Those trooping damsels slender-
           fair:
Virgins of graceful swimming gait * Ready with eye and lip to
            ensnare;
And like the tendril'd vine they loose * The rich profusion of
            their hair:
Shooting their shafts and arrows from * Beautiful eyes beyond
          compare;
Overpowering and transpiercing * Every froward adversaire.""

Sharrkan gazed upon the ten girls and saw in their midst a lady like the moon at fullest, with ringleted hair and forehead sheeny white, and eyes wondrous wide and black and bright, and temple locks like the scorpion's tail; and she was perfect in essence and attributes, as the poet said of her in these couplets,

""She beamed on my sight with a wondrous glance, * And her
            straight slender stature enshamed the lance:
She burst on my sight with cheeks rosy red, * Where all manner of
            beauties have habitance:
And the locks on her forehead were lowering as night * Whence
            issues a dawn tide of happiest chance.""

Then Sharrkan heard her say to the handmaids, ""Come ye on, that I may wrestle with you and gravel you, ere the moon set and the dawn break!"" So each came up to her in turn and she grounded them forthright, and pinioned them with their girdles, and ceased not wrestling and pitching them until she had overthrown one and all. Then there turned to her an old woman who was before her, and the beldam said as in wrath, ""O strumpet, cost thou glory in grounding these girls? Behold I am an old woman, yet have I thrown them forty times! So what hast thou to boast of? But if thou have the strength to wrestle with me, stand up that I may grip thee and set thy head between thy heels!"" The young lady smiled at her words, but she was filled with inward wrath, and she jumped up and asked, ""O my lady Zat al-Dawahi,[FN#163] by the truth of the Messiah, wilt thou wrestle with me in very deed, or dost thou jest with me?""; and she answered, ""Yea,""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Forty-seventh Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the young lady asked Zat al-Dawahi, ""By the truth of the Messiah, wilt wrestle with me or dost jest?"", and she answered, ""Yea, I will wrestle with thee in very deed"" (Sharrkan looking on the while), the damsel cried, ""Rise up for the fall an thou have spunk so to do."" When the old woman heard this, she raged with exceeding rage, and her body hair stood on end like the bristles of a fretful hedgehog.[FN#164] Then she sprang to her feet, whilst the damsel stood up to her, and said, ""Now by the truth of the Messiah, I will not wrestle with thee unless I be naked, Mistress whore!""[FN#165] So she loosed her petticoat trousers and, putting her hand under her clothes, tore them off her body; then twisted up a silken kerchief into cord shape, girt it round her middle and became as she were a scald head If ritah or a spotted snake. With this she inclined towards the damsel and said, ""Do thou as I have done."" All this time, Sharrkan was gazing at the twain, and laughing at the beldam's loathly semblance. So the damsel leisurely rose and, taking a sash of Yamani stuff, passed it twice round her waist, then she tucked up her trousers and displayed two calves of alabaster carrying a mound of crystal, smooth and rounded, and a stomach which exhaled musk from its dimples, as it were a bed of Nu'uman's anemones; and breasts like double pomegranates. Then the old woman leant towards her, and the two laid hold either of each, while Sharrkan raised his head Heavenwards and prayed Allah that the belle might beat the beldam. Presently the young woman get beneath the old woman; and, gripping her waist cloth with the left and circling her neck with the right hand, hoisted her off the ground with both; whereupon the old woman strove to free herself and, in so doing fell on her back arsiversy, with her legs high in air and her hairy bush between them showed manifest in the moonshine; furthermore she let fly two great farts[FN#166] one of which blew up the dust from the earth's face and the other steamed up to the gate of Heaven. Sharrkan laughed till he fell back upon the ground. Then he arose and, baring his brand looked right and left, but he saw no one save the old woman sprawling on her back, and said to himself, ""He lied not who named thee Lady of Calamities! Verily thou knewest her prowess by her performance upon the others."" So he drew near them to hear what should pass between them. Then the young lady went up to the old one and, throwing a wrapper of thin silk upon her nakedness, helped her to don her clothes and made excuses saying, ""O my lady Zat al- Dawahi, I intended only to throw thee and not all this, but thou triedst to twist out of my hands; so laud to Allah for safety!"" She returned her no answer, but rose in her shame and walked away till out of sight, leaving the handmaids prostrate and pinioned, with the fair damsel standing amongst them. Quoth Sharrkan to himself, ""Every luck hath its cause. Sleep did not fall upon me nor the war horse bear me hither save for my good fortune; for doubtless this maid and what is with her shall become booty to me."" So he made towards his steed and mounted and heeled[FN#167] him on, when he sped as the shaft speeds from the bow and in his hand he still hent his brand bare of sheath, which he brandished shouting the while his war cry, ""Allah is All mighty[FN#168]!"" When the damsel saw him she sprang to her feet and, taking firm stand on the bank of the stream, whose breadth was six ells, the normal cubits, made one bound and landed clear on the farther side,[FN#169] where she turned and cried out with a loud voice, ""Who art thou, O thou fellow, that breakest in upon our privacy and pastime, and that too hanger in hand as if charging a host? Whence camest thou and whither art thou going? Speak sooth, for truth will stand thee in good stead, and lie not, for lies come of villein breed Doubtless thou hast wandered this night from thy way, that thou chancedst upon this place whence escape were the greatest of mercies; for thou art now in an open plain and, did we shout but a single shout, would come to our rescue four thousand knights.[FN#170] So tell me what thou wantest; and if thou wouldst only have us set thee on the right road, we will do so."" When Sharrkan heard her words he replied, ""I am a stranger of the Moslems, who fared forth this night single handed, seeking for spoil; nor could this moonlight show me a fairer booty than these ten maidens; so I shall seize them and rejoin my comrades with them."" Quoth she, ""I would have thee know that as for the booty thou hast not come at it; and, as for the handmaids, by Allah, they shall never be thy spoil. Have I not told thee that to lie is villein vile?"" Quoth he, ""The wise man is he who taketh warning by others."" Thereupon quoth she, ""By the truth of the Messiah, did I not fear that thy death would be on my hands, I would shout a shout should fill the mead for thee with war steeds and with men of might, but I take pity upon the stranger. So, if thou seek booty, I require of thee that thou alight from thy steed and swear to me, by thy faith, that thou wilt not advance against me aught like arms in hand, and we will wrestle, I and thou. If thou throw me, set me on thy steed and take all of us to thy booty; but if I throw thee, thou shalt become under my command. Swear this to me, for I fear thy treachery: indeed it hath become a common saw, 'Where Perfidy is innate there Trust is a weakly mate.' Now an thou wilt swear I will return and draw near to thee and tackle thee."" Answered Sharrkan (and indeed he lusted to seize her and said in his soul, ""Truly she knoweth not that I am a champion of champions""); ""Swear me by what oath thou wilt and by what thou deemest most binding, and I will not approach thee with aught till thou hast made thy preparation and sayest, 'Draw near that I wrestle with thee.' If thou throw me, I have money where withal to ransom myself; and if I throw thee, 'twill be booty and booty enough for me!"" Rejoined the damsel, ""I am content herewith!"" and Sharrkan was astounded at her words and said, ""And by the truth of the Apostle (whom Allah bless and keep!) I too am content on the other part!"" Then said she, ""Swear to me by Him who sprite in body dight and dealt laws to rule man kind aright, that thou wilt not offer me aught of violence save by way of wrestling; else mayst thou die without the pale of Al- Islam."" Sharrkan replied, ""By Allah! were a Kazi to swear me, even though he were a Kazi of the Kazis,[FN#171] he would not impose upon me such an oath as this!"" Then he sware to her by all she named and tied his steed to a tree; but he was drowned in the sea of thought, saying in himself, ""Praise be to Him who fashioned her from dirty water!""[FN#172] Then he girt himself and made ready for wrestling, and said to her, ""Cross the stream to me;"" but she replied, ""It is not for me to come over to thee: if thou wilt, pass thou over here to me."" ""I cannot do that,"" quoth he, and quoth she, ""O boy, I will come across to thee."" So she tucked up her skirts and, leaping, landed on the other side of the stream by his side; whereupon he drew near to her and bent him forwards and clapped palms.[FN#173] But he was confounded by her beauty and loveliness; for he saw a shape which the Hand of Power had tanned with the dye leaves of the Jann, which had been fostered by the Hand of Beneficence and fanned by the Zephyrs of fair fortune and whose birth a propitious ascendant had greeted. Then she called out to him, ""O Moslem, come on and let us wrestle ere the break of morning,"" and tucked up her sleeves from a forearm like fresh curd, which illumined the whole place with its whiteness; and Sharrkan was dazzled by it. Then he bent forwards and clapped his palms by way of challenge, she doing the like, and caught hold of her, and the two grappled and gripped and interlocked hands and arms. Presently he shifted his hands to her slender waist, when his finger tips sank into the soft folds of her middle, breeding languishment, and he fell a trembling like the Persian reed in the roaring gale. So she lifted him up and, throwing him to the ground, sat upon his breast with hips and hinder cheeks like mounds of sand, for his soul had lost mastery over his senses. Then she asked him, ""O Moslem! the slaying of Nazarenes is lawful to you folk; what then hast thou to say about being slain thyself?""; and he answered, ""O my lady, thy speech as regards slaying me is not other than unlawful; for our prophet Mohammed (whom Allah bless and preserve!) prohibited the slaying of women and children, old men and monks!"" ""As it was thus revealed to your Prophet,"" she replied, ""it behoveth us to render the equivalent of his mercy; so rise. I give thee thy life, for generosity is never lost upon the generous."" Then she got off his breast and he rose and stood shaking the dust from his head against the owners of the curved rib, even women; and she said to him, ""Be not ashamed; but verily one who entereth the land of Roum in quest of booty, and cometh to assist Kings against Kings, how happeneth it that he hath not strength enough to defend himself from one made out of the curved rib?"" ""'Twas not for lack of strength in me,"" he answered; ""nor didst thou throw me by thy force; it was thy loveliness overthrew me; so if thou wilt grant me another bout, it will be of thy courtesy."" She laughed and said, ""I grant thee thy request: but these handmaids have long been pinioned and their arms and sides are weary, and it were only right I should loose them, for haply this next wrestling bout will be long."" Then she went to the slave girls and, unbinding them, said to them in the tongue of Greece, ""Get ye to some safe place, till I foil this Moslem's lust and longing for you."" So they went away, whilst Sharrkan kept gazing at them and they kept turning to look at the two. Then each approached the adversary and he set his breast against hers, but when he felt waist touch waist, his strength failed him; and she, waxing ware of this, lifted him with her hands swiftlier than the blinding leven-flash, and threw him to the ground. He fell on his back,[FN#174] and then she said to him, ""Rise: I give thee thy life a second time. I spared thee in the first count because of thy Prophet, for that he made unlawful the slaying of women; and I do so on the second count because of thy weakliness and the greenness of thine years and thy strangerhood; but I charge thee, if there be in the Moslem army sent by Omar bin al-Nu'uman to succour the King of Constantinople, a stronger than thou, send him hither and tell him of me: for in wrestling there are shifts and trips, catches and holds, such as the feint or falsing and the snap or first grip, the hug, the feet-catch, the thigh Lite,[FN#175] the jostle and the leg-lock."" ""By Allah, O my lady,"" quoth Sharrkan (and indeed he was highly incensed against her), ""had I been Master al-Safdí, Master Mohammed Kimál or Ibn al-Saddí,[FN#176] as they were in their prime, I had kept no note of these shifts thou mentionest; for O my mistress, by Allah, thou hast not grassed me by thy strength, but by the blandishments of thy back parts; for we men of Mesopotamia so love a full formed thigh that nor sense was left me nor foresight. But now, an thou wish, thou shalt try a third fall with me while my wits are about me, and this last match is allowed me by the laws of the game which sayeth the best of three: moreover I have regained my presence of mind."" When she heard his words she said to him, ""Hast thou not had a belly full of this wrestling, O vanquished one? However come on, an thou wilt; but know that this must be the last round."" Then she bent forward and challenged him and Sharrkan did likewise, setting to it in real earnest and being right cautious about the throw: so the two strove awhile and the damsel found in him a strength such as she had not observed before and said to him, ""O Moslem, thou art now on thy mettle."" ""Yes,"" he replied, ""thou knowest that there remaineth to me but this one round, after which each of us will wend a different way."" She laughed and he laughed too;[FN#177] then she overreached at his thigh and caught firm hold of it unawares, which made him greet the ground and fall full on his back. She laughed at him and said, ""Art thou an eater of bran? Thou are like a Badawi's bonnet which falleth off with every touch or else the Father of Winds[FN#178] that droppeth before a puff of air. Fie upon thee, O thou poor thing!"" adding, ""Get thee back to the Moslem army and send us other than thyself, for thou fairest of thews; and proclaim for us, among the Arabs and Persians, the Turks and Daylamites,[FN#179] whoso hath might in him, let him come to us."" Then she made a spring and landed on the other side of the stream and said to Sharrkan, laughing, ""Parting with thee is right grievous to me, O my lord; but get thee to thy mates before dawn, lest the Knights come upon thee and pick thee up on their lance points. Thou hast no strength to defend thee against a woman, so how couldst thou hold thine own amongst men of might and Knights?"" Sharrkan was confounded and called to her (as she turned from him making towards the convent), ""O my lady, wilt thou go away and leave the miserable stranger, the broken hearted slave of love?"" So she turned to him laughing and said, ""What is thy want? I will grant thee thy prayer."" ""Have I set foot in thy country and tasted the sweetness of thy courtesy,"" replied he, ""and shall I return without eating of thy victual and tasting thy hospitality; I who have become one of thy servitors!"" ""None baulk kindliness save the base,"" she rejoined, ""honour us in Allah's name, on my head and eyes be it! Mount thy steed and ride along the brink of the stream over against me, for now thou art my guest."" At this Sharrkan was glad and, hastening back to his horse, mounted and walked him abreast of her, and she kept faring on till they came to a drawbridge[FN#180] built of beams of the white poplar, hung by pullies and steel chains and made fast with hooks and padlocks. When Sharrkan looked, he saw awaiting her upon the bridge the same ten handmaids whom she had thrown in the wrestling bouts; and, as she came up to them, she said to one in the Greek tongue, ""Arise and take the reins of his horse and conduct him across into the convent."" So she went up to Sharrkan and led him over, much puzzled and perturbed with what he saw, and saying to himself, ""O would that the Wazir Dandan were here with me that his eyes might look upon these fairest of favours."" Then he turned to the young lady and said to her, ""O marvel of loveliness, now I have two claims upon thee; first the claim of good fellowship, and secondly for that thou hast carried me to thy home and offered me thy hospitality. I am now under thy commandance and thy guidance; so do me one last favour by accompanying me to the lands of Al-Islam; where thou shalt look upon many a lion hearted warrior and thou shalt learn who I am."" When she heard this she was angered and said to him, ""By the truth of the Messiah, thou hast proved thyself with me a man of keen wit; but now I see what mischief there is in thy heart, and how thou canst permit thyself a speech which proveth thy traitorous intent. How should I do as thou sayest, when I wot that if I came to that King of yours, Omar bin al- Nu'uman, I should never get free from him? For truly he hath not the like of me or behind his city walls or within his palace halls, Lord of Baghdad and of Khorasan though he be, who hath built for himself twelve pavilions, in number as the months of the year, and in each a concubine after the number of the days; and if I come to him he would not prove shy of me, for your folk believe I am lawful to have and to hold as is said in your writ, 'Or those women whom your right hand shall possess as slaves.'[FN#181] So how canst thou speak thus to me? As for thy saying, 'Thou shalt look upon the braves of the Moslems,' by the truth of the Messiah, thou sayest that which is not true, for I saw your army when it reached our land, these two days ago; and I did not see that your ordinance was the ordinance of Kings, but I beheld only a rabble of tribesmen gathered together. And as to thy words, 'Thou shalt know who I am,' I did not do thee kindness because of thy dignity but out of pride in myself; and the like of thee should not talk thus to the like of me, even wert thou Sharrkan, Omar bin al- Nu'uman's son, the prowess name in these days!"" ""Knowest thou Sharrkan?"" asked he; and she answered Yes! and I know of his coming with an army numbering ten thousand horsemen; also that he was sent by his sire with this force to gain prevalence for the King of Constantinople."" ""O my lady,"" said Sharrkan, ""I adjure thee by thy religion, tell me the cause of all this, that sooth may appear to me clear of untruth, and with whom the fault lies."" ""Now by the virtue of thy faith,"" she replied, ""did I not fear lest the news of me be bruited abroad that I am of the daughters of Roum, I would adventure myself and sally forth single handed against the ten thousand horsemen and slay their leader, the Wazir Dandan and vanquish their champion Sharrkan.[FN#182] Nor would aught of shame accrue to me thereby, for I have read books and studied the rules of good breeding in the language of the Arabs. But I have no need to vaunt my own prowess to thee, more by token as thou hast proved in thy proper person my skill and strength in wrestling; and thou hast learnt my superiority over other women. Nor, indeed, had Sharrkan himself been here this night and it were said to him, 'Clear this stream,' could he have done it; and I only long and lust that the Messiah would throw him into my hands in this very convent, that I might go forth to him in the habit of a man and drag him from his saddle seat and make him my captive and lay him in bilboes.""- -And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Forty-eighth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Nazarene damsel said to Sharrkan (and he listening impatiently enow), ""Verily if Sharrkan fell into my hands, I would go forth to him in the habit of a man and drag him from his saddle seat and make him my captive and lay him in bilboes,"" pride and passion and knightly jealousy took possession of him and he desired to discover and declare himself and to lay on load; but her loveliness restrained him and he began repeating,

""An faulty of one fault the Beauty prove, * Her charms a thousand advocates shall move.""

So she went up and Sharrkan after her; and, when he saw the maiden's back and hinder cheeks that clashed against each other, like rollers in the rolling sea, he extemporised these couplets:- -

""For her sins is a pleader that brow, * And all hearts its fair
             pleading must bow:
When I saw it I cried, ""To night * The moon at its fullest doth
            show;
Tho' Balkis' own Ifrit[FN#183] try a bout, * Spite his force she
            would deal him a throw.""

The two fared on till they reached a gate over which rose a marble archway. This she opened and ushered Sharrkan into a long vestibule, vaulted with ten connected arches, from each of which hung a crystal lamp glistening like a spark of fire. The handmaids met her at the further end bearing wax candles of goodly perfume, and wearing on their heads golden fillets crusted with all manner bezel gems,[FN#184] and went on before her (Sharrkan still following), till they reached the inner convent. There the Moslem saw couches and sofas ranged all around, one opposite the other and all over hung with curtains flowered in gold. The monastery floor was paved with every kind of vari coloured marbles and mosaic work, and in the midst stood a basin that held four and twenty jetting fountains of gold, whence the water ran like molten silver; whilst at the upper end stood a throne spread with silks fit only for Kings. Then said the damsel, ""Ascend, O my lord, this throne."" So he went up to it and sat down and she withdrew to remain absent for some time. Sharrkan asked of her from one of the servants who answered him, ""She hath gone to her dormitory; but we will serve thee even as she ordered."" So they set before him viands of rare varieties, and he ate his sufficiency, when they brought him a basin of gold and an ewer of silver, and he washed his hands. Then his thoughts reverted to his army, knowing not what had befallen it in his absence and calling to mind also how he had forgotten his father's injunctions: so he was troubled about his case, repenting of what he had done till the dawn broke and the day appeared; when he lamented and sighed and became drowned in sea of sadness and repeated,

""I am not lost to prudence, but indeed * Here I'm bewildered,
            what shall be my rede?
Would any aid me in mine ails of love, * By my own might and
            sleight would I be free'd:
But ah! my heart is lost and passion-shent: * To none save Allah
          can I trust my need!""

When he ended his verse behold, there came up to him a rare show and a fair, more than twenty maidens like crescents encompassing the young lady, who shone in their midst as the full moon among the constellations guarding and girding her. She was clad in brocades befitting Kings; her breasts were like twin pomegranates, a woven zone set with all kinds of jewels tightly clasped her waist which expanded below into jutting hips; and her hinder cheeks stood out as a mound of crystal[FN#185] supporting a silvern shaft. When Sharrkan looked at her his wits went nigh to fly away from him with delight; and he forgot army and Wazir as he gazed on her fair head decked and dight with a net work of pearls set off by divers sorts of gems. Handmaids on her right and handmaids on her left bore her train, as she paced with dainty graceful gait in all the pride of seemlihead. He sprang to his feet seeing such beauty and loveliness, and cried aloud, ""Beware and beware of that zone rarely fair!"" and broke out into these couplets,

""With heavy back parts, high breasts delicate, * And lissome form
           that sways with swimming gait
She deftly hides love longing in her breast; * But I may never
           hide its ban and bate
While hosts of followers her steps precede,[FN#186] * Like pearls
            now necklaced and now separate.""

She gazed upon him for a long time and considered him till she was assured of him, when she came up to him and said, ""In very sooth the place is honoured and illumined by thee, O Sharrkan! How sped thy night, O hero, after we went away and left thee?""; adding, ""Verily lying is a vile thing and a shameful, especially in great Kings! and thou art Crown Prince Sharrkan, son and heir of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman; so henceforth make no secret of thy rank and condition, nor let me hear aught from thee but the truth; for leasing bequeatheth hate and despite. And as thou art pierced by the shaft of Fate, be resignation thine and abide content to wait."" When he heard her words he saw that artifice availed him naught and he acknowledged the truth, saying, ""I am Sharrkan, bin Omar bin al-Nu'uman, whom fortune hath afflicted and cast into this place; so whatso thou willest, do it in my case!"" She hung her head groundwards a long while, then turned to him and said, ""Be of good cheer and let thine eyes be cool and clear;[FN#187] for thou art the guest of my hospitality, and bread and salt hath made a tie between me and thee; wherefore thou art in my ward and under my safeguard. Have no fear for, by the truth of the Messiah, if all on earth sought to do thee hurt they should not come at thee, till life had left my body for thy sake: indeed thou art now under the charge of the Messiah and of me."" Hereat she sat her down by his side and fell to playing with him, till his alarm subsided and he knew that had she desired to slay him, she would have done so during the past night. Presently she bespoke in the Grecian tongue one of her slave girls, who went away and soon came back bringing a beaker and a tray of food; but Sharrkan abstained from eating and said to himself, ""Haply she hath put somewhat in this meat."" She knew what was in his thought; so she turned to him and said, ""By the truth of the Messiah, the case is not on such wise, nor is there aught in this meat of what thou suspectest! Had my mind been set on slaying thee, I had slain thee ere now."" Then she walked up to the tray and ate of every dish a mouthful; where upon Sharrkan came forward and ate too. She was pleased at this and both ate till they were satisfied. They washed their hands and after that she rose and ordered a handmaid to bring perfumes and herbs of sweet savour, wines of all colours and kinds and a wine-service with vessels of gold, silver and crystal. She filled a first goblet and drank it off before offering it to him, even as she had done with the food: then she crowned a second and handed it to him. He drank and she said to him, ""O Moslem, see how thou art here in all solace and delight of life!"" And she ceased not to drink and ply him with drink, till he took leave of his wits,- -And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day, and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Forty-ninth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the damsel ceased not to drink and ply Sharrkan with drink till he took leave of his wits, for the wine and the intoxication of love he bore her. Presently she said to the slave girl, ""O Marjanah[FN#188]! bring us some instruments of music!"" ""To hear is to obey,"" said the hand maid and going out, returned in the twinkling of an eye with a Damascus lute,[FN#189] a Persian harp, a Tartar pipe, and an Egyptian dulcimer. The young lady took the lute and, after tuning each several string, began in gentle undersong to sing, softer than zephyr's wing and sweeter than Tasmin[FN#190] spring, with heart safe and secure from everything the couplets following,

""Allah assain those eyne! What streams of blood they shed! * How
           many an arrowy glance those lids of thine have sped.
I love all lovers who to lovers show them cure; * 'Twere wrong to
           rue the love in wrong head born and bred:
Haply fall hapless eye for thee no sleeping kens! * Heaven help
          the hapless heart by force of thee misled!
Thou doomest me to death who art my king, and I * Ransom with
          life the deemster who would doom me dead.""

Thereupon each and every of the maidens rose up and taking an instrument, played and recited couplets in the Roumi tongue; then their mistress sang also and seeing Sharrkan in ecstasies asked him, ""O Moslem, dost thou understand what I say?""; and he answered, ""Nay, my ecstasy cometh from the beauty of thy finger sips."" She laughed and continued, ""If I sing to thee in Arabic what wouldst thou do?"" ""I should no longer,"" quoth he, ""be master of my senses."" Then she took an instrument and, changing the measure, began singing these verses,

""The smack of parting's myrrh to me, * How, then, bear patience'
            aloë?
I'm girt by ills in trinity * Severance, distance,
             cruelty!
My freedom stole that fairest she, * And parting irks me
            bitterly.""

When she ended her verse, she looked at Sharrkan and found him lost to existence, and he lay for a while stretched at full length and prone among the maidens.[FN#191] Then he revived and, remembering the songs, again inclined to mirth and merriment; and the twain returned to their wine and wassail, and continued their playing and toying, their pastime and pleasure till day ceased illuminating and night drooped her wing. Then the damsel went off to her dormitory and when Sharrkan asked after her they answered, ""She is gone to her sleeping chamber,"" whereto he rejoined, ""Under Allah's ward and His good guard!"" As soon as it was morning, a handmaid came to him and said to him, ""My mistress biddeth thee to her."" So he rose and followed her and, as he drew near her lodging, the damsels welcomed him with smitten tabrets and songs of greeting, and led him through a great door of ivory studded with pearls and jewels. Thence they passed with him into a tall and spacious hall, at the upper end of which was a wide dais carpeted with all kinds of silks, and round it open lattices commanding a view of trees and streams. About the saloon were figures carved in human form, and fashioned on such wise that the air passed through them and set in motion musical instruments within, so that the beholder would fancy they spoke.[FN#192] Here sat the young lady, looking at the figures; but when she saw Sharrkan, she sprang to her feet and, taking him by the hand, made him sit down by her side, and asked him how he had passed the night. He blessed her and the two sat talking awhile till she asked him, ""Knowest thou aught touching lovers and slaves of love?""; and he answered ""Yes! I wot somewhat in verse on that matter."" ""Let me hear it,"" quoth she, so he began quoting,

""Pleasure and health, good cheer, good appetite * To Azzah,
           freest with our name and fame!
By Allah! would I near her off she flies * At tangent, granting
           less the more I claim:
I dote on Azzah, but when clear I off * My rivals, clears me too
           that dearest dame;
Like wandering wight that chose for shade a cloud * Which, ere
            siesta done, thin air became.""

When she heard this she said, ""Verily Al-Kuthayyir[FN#193] was conspicuous for sweet speech and chaste, and he was superlative in his praise of Azzah when he sang"" (and she began to recite),

""Did Azzah deal behest to Sun o' noon, * The judge had judged her
             beauty's bestest boon;
And girls who come to me and carp at her, * God make their rosy
           cheeks her sandal-shoon!

And indeed,"" quoth she, ""'twas said that Azzah boasted exceeding beauty and loveliness."" Then she asked Sharrkan saying, ""O Prince, cost thou know aught of Jamil's[FN#194] verses to Buthaynah? if so repeat to us somewhat of them;"" and he answered, ""Yes, I know them better than any;"" whereupon he began repeating these couplets,

""Jamil, in Holy war go fight!"" to me they say: * What war save
            fight for fair ones would I e'er essay?
To me their every word and work are mere delight, * And martyrs
           crepe I all they slay in fight and fray:
An ask I, 'O Buthaynah! what's this love, I pray, * Which eats
            my heart?' quoth she ' 'Twill stay for ever and aye!'
And when I cry, 'Of wits return some small display * For daily
            use,' quoth she, 'Far, far 'tis fled away!
Thou seekst my death; naught else thy will can satisfy * While I
             no goal espy save thee and thee alway.'""

""Thou hast spoken right well,"" said she, ""O King's son, and Jamil also spoke excellently well. But what would Buthaynah have done with him that he saith in his hemistich,

'Thou seekst my death; naught else thy will can satisfy?'""

""O my lady,"" quoth Sharrkan, ""she willed to do him what thou willest to do with me, and even that will not satisfy thee."" She laughed at his opportune reply and they ceased not carousing till Day put out her light and Night came in darkness dight. Then she rose and went to her dormitory and slept, while Sharrkan slept in his place till morning dawned. As soon as he awoke, the hand maids came to him with tabrets and other instruments of mirth and merriment, as wont; and, kissing the ground between his hands, said to him, ""Bismillah! in Allah's name be so kind as to come[FN#195]: our mistress biddeth thee to her presence!"" So he rose and accompanied the slave girls who surrounded him, playing on tabrets and other instruments of music, till they passed from that saloon into another and a yet more spacious hall, decorated with pictured likenesses and figures of birds and beasts, passing all description. Sharrkan marvelled at the art and artifice of the place and began reciting,

""He plucks fruits of her necklace in rivalry, * And her breast-
           pearls that bedded in gold mine lie.
Pure water on silvern bars is her brow, * And her cheeks show
             roses with rubies vie:
Meseems in her eyne that the violet's hue * Lies purpling set in
            the Ithmid's[FN#196] dye.""
When the lady saw Sharrkan, she stood up to him in honour and,
taking his hand, seated him by her side and asked, ""O son of King
Omar bin al-Nu'uman, hast thou any cunning in the game of chess?""
""Yes,"" he answered, ""but do not thou with me as said the poet,
'I speak and longing love upties me and unties me; * Till with
             her honey dew of inner lip she plies me:
I brought the chess board and my liefest lover plays me * With
            white and black,[FN#197] but black cum white ne'er satisfies
             me:
'Twas as if King for Castle I were fain to place me * Till wilful
             loss of game atwixt two queens surprise me:
And if I seek to read intent in eyes that eye me * Oh man! that
             glance askance with hint of wish defies me.'""

Then she brought the chessboard and played with him; but Sharrkan, instead of looking at her moves, kept gazing at her fair mouth, and putting knight in place of elephant and elephant[FN#198] instead of knight. She laughed and said to him, ""If thy play be after this fashion, thou knowest naught of the game."" ""This is only our first,"" replied he, ""judge not by this bout."" When she beat him he replaced the pieces in position and played again with her; but she beat him a second time, a third, a fourth and a fifth. So she turned to him and said, ""Thou art beaten in everything;"" and he replied, ""O my lady, how should one playing with the like of thee avoid being beaten?"" Then she bade bring food, and they ate and washed their hands; after which the wine was set before them and they drank. Presently, she took the dulcimer, for her hand was cunning in smiting it, and she began repeating to an accompaniment these couplets,

""Twixt the close tied and open wide no medium Fortune knoweth, *
            Now ebb and flow then flow and ebb this wise her likeness
             showeth.
Then drink her wine the syne she's thine and smiling thou dost
             find her * Anon she'll fall and fare away when all thy good
             forth goeth.""

They ceased not to carouse till nightfall and this day was pleasanter even than the first. When darkness set in, the lady betook her to her dormitory, leaving him alone with the hand maids; so he threw himself on the ground and slept till dawn, when the damsels came to him with tambourines and other instruments according to custom. Seeing them he roused him hastily and sat up; and they carried him to their mistress, who came to meet him and, taking him by the hand, seated him by her side. Then she asked him how he had passed his night, whereat he prayed that her life be prolonged; and she took the lute and sang to it these verses which she improvised,

""Ne'er incline thee to part * Which embitters the heart
E'en the sun when he sets * Shall in pallor depart.""

While they were solacing themselves after this fashion, behold, there arose a great and sudden clamour, and a confused crowd of knights and men rushed in, holding drawn swords that glittered and gleamed in their hands, and cried aloud in the Grecian tongue ""Thou hast fallen into our hands, O Sharrkan, so make thee sure of death!"" When he heard this, he said to himself, ""By Allah, she hath entrapped me and held me in play, till her men should come. These are the Knights with whom she threatened me; but 'tis I who have thrown myself into this strait."" Then he turned towards the young lady to reproach her, but saw that she had changed colour and her face was pale; and she sprang to her feet and asked the crowd, ""Who are ye?"" ""O most gracious Princess and peerless onion pearl,"" answered the leading Knight, ""dost thou weet who is yon man by thy side?"" ""Not I,"" she replied, ""who may he be?"" Quoth the Patrician, ""This is of towns the highwayman! This is he who rideth in the horseman's van! This is Sharrkan, son of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman! This is he that forceth fortalice and penetrateth every impregnable place! The news of him reached King Hardub, thy father, by report of the ancient dame Zat al- Dawahi; and thy sire, our sovereign, hath made sure that thou hast rendered good service to the army of the Greeks by taking captive this ominous lion."" When she heard this, she looked at the Knight and asked him, ""What be thy name?"" and he answered, ""I am Másúrah, son of thy slave Mausúrah bin Káshardah, Knight of Knights."" ""And how?"" quoth she, ""durst thou enter my presence without leave?"" Quoth he, ""O my lady, when I came to the gate, none forbade me, neither chamberlain nor porter, but all the door keepers rose and forewent us as of wont; although, when others come, they leave them standing at the gate while they ask permission to admit them. But this is not a time for long talking, when the King is expecting our return with this Prince, the scorpion sting[FN#199] of the Islamitic host, that he may kill him and drive back his men whither they came, without the bane of battling with them."" ""These words be ill words,"" rejoined the Princess, ""and Dame Zat al-Dawahi lied, avouching an idle thing and a vain, whereof she weeteth not the truth; for by the virtue of the Messiah, this man who is with me is not Sharrkan, nor is he a captive, but a stranger who came to us seeking our hospitality, and I made him my guest. So even were we assured that this be Sharrkan and were it proved to us that it is he beyond a doubt, I say it would ill befit mine honour that I should deliver into your hands one who hath entered under my protection. So make me not a traitor to my guest and a disgrace among men; but return to the King, my father, and kiss the ground before him, and inform him that the case is contrariwise to the report of the Lady Zat al-Dawahi."" ""O Abrízah,"" replied Masurah, the Knight, ""I cannot return to the King's majesty without his debtor and enemy."" Quoth she (and indeed she had waxed very wroth). ""Out on thee! Return to him with my answer, and no blame shall befal thee!"" Quoth Masurah, ""I will not return without him."" Thereupon her colour changed and she exclaimed, ""Exceed not in talk and vain words; for verily this man had not come in to us, were he not assured that he could of himself and single handed make head against an hundred riders; and if I said to him, 'Thou art Sharrkan, son of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman,' he would answer, 'Yes.' But 'tis not of your competence to let or hinder him; for if you do so, he will not turn back from you till he hath slain all that are in this place. Behold, here he is by my side, and I will bring him before you sword and targe in hand."" ""Albeit I were safe from thy wrath,"" answered Masurah the Knight, ""I am not safe from that of thy father, and when I see him, I shall sign to the Knights to take him captive, and we will carry him to the King bound and in abject sort."" When she heard this, she said, ""The matter shall not pass thus, for 'twould be blazoning mere folly. This man is but one and ye are an hundred Knights: so if you would attack him come out against him, one after one, that it may appear to the King which is the valiant amongst you.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Fiftieth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Princess Abrizah said to the Knight, ""This man is but one, and ye are an hundred: so if ye would attack him, come out against him, one after one, that it may appear to the King which is the valiant."" Quoth Masurah, the Knight, ""By the truth of the Messiah, thou sayest sooth, and none but I shall sally out against him first."" Quoth she, ""Wait till I go to him and acquaint him with the case and hear what answer he will make. If he consent, 'tis well; but if he refuse, ye shall on no wise come to him, for I and my hand maids and whosoever is in the convent will be his ransom."" So she went to Sharrkan and told him the news, whereat he smiled and knew that she had not informed any of the Emirs; but that tidings of him had been bruited and blazed abroad, till the report reached the King, against her wish and intent. So he again began reproaching himself and said, ""How came I to adventure and play with my life by coming to the country of the Greeks?"" But hearing the young lady's proposal he said to her, ""Indeed their onset, one after one, would be overburdensome to them. Will they not come out against me, ten by ten?"" ""That would be villainy,"" said she; ""Let one have at one."" When he heard this, he sprang to his feet and made for them with his sword and battle gear; and Masurah, the Knight, also sprang up and bore down upon him. Sharrkan met him like a lion and delivered a shoulder cut[FN#200] which clove him to the middle, and the blade came out gleaming and glittering from his back and bowels. When the lady beheld that swashingblow, Sharrkan's might was magnified in her sight and she knew that when she overthrew him in the wrestle it was not by her strength but by her beauty and loveliness. So she turned to the Knights and said, ""Take wreak for your chief!"" Thereupon out came the slain man's brother, a fierce and furious Knight, and rushed upon Sharrkan, who delayed not, but smote him also with the shoulder cut and the sword came out glittering from his vitals. Then cried the Princess, ""O ye servants of the Messiah, avenge your comrade!"" So they ceased not charging down upon him, one after one; and Sharrkan also ceased not playing upon them with the blade, till he had slain fifty Knights, the lady looking on the while. And Allah cast a panic into the hearts of the survivors, so that they held back and dared not meet him in the duello, but fell upon him in a body; and he laid on load with heart firmer than a rock, and smote them and trod them down like straw under the threshing sled,[FN#201] till he had driven sense and soul out of them. Then the Princess called aloud to her damsels, saying, ""Who is left in the convent?""; and they replied, ""None but the gate keepers;"" whereupon she went up to Sharrkan and took him to her bosom, he doing the same, and they returned to the palace, after he had made an end of the melee. Now there remained a few of the Knights hiding from him in the cells of the monastery, and when the Princess saw this she rose from Sharrkan's side and left him for a while, but presently came back clad in closely meshed coat of ring mail and holding in her hand a fine Indian scymitar. And she said, ""Now by the truth of the Messiah, I will not be a niggard of myself for my guest; nor will I abandon him though for this I abide a reproach and a by word in the land of the Greeks."" Then she took reckoning of the dead and found that he had slain fourscore of the Knights, and other twenty had taken to flight.[FN#202] When she saw what work he had made with them she said to him, ""Allah bless thee, O Sharrkan! The Cavaliers may well glory in the like of thee."" Then he rose and wiping his blade clean of the blood of the slain began reciting these couplets,

""How oft in the mellay I've cleft the array, * And given their
             bravest to lions a prey:
Ask of me and of them when I proved me prow * O'er creation, on
             days of the foray and fray:
When I left in the onslaught their lions to lie * On the sands of
             the low lands[FN#203] in fieriest day.""

When he ended his verse, the Princess came up to him with smiles and kissed his hand; then she doffed her hauberk and he said to her, ""O lady mine, wherefore didst thou don that coat of mail and bare thy brand?"" ""To guard thee against these caitiffs,""[FN#204] she replied. Then she summoned the gate keepers and asked them, ""How came ye to admit the King's Knights into my dwelling without leave of me?""; and they answered, ""O Princess, it is not our custom to ask leave of thee for the King's messengers, and especially for the chief of his Knights."" Quoth she, ""I think ye were minded only to disgrace me and murder my guest;"" and bade Sharrkan smite their necks. He did so and she cried to the rest of her servants, ""Of a truth, they deserved even more than that!"" Then turning to Sharrkan, she said to him, ""Now that there hath become manifest to thee what was concealed, thou shalt be made acquainted with my history. Know, then, that I am the daughter of King Hardub of Roum; my name is Abrizah and the ancient dame, yclept Zat al-Dawahi, is my grandmother by the sword side. She it certainly is who told my father of thee, and as surely she will compass a sleight to slay me, more by token as thou hast slain my father's chivalry and it is noised abroad that I have separated myself from the Nazarenes and have become no better than I should be with the Moslems. Wherefore it were wiser that I leave this dwelling while Zat al-Dawahi is on my track; but I require of thee the like kindness and courtesy I have shown thee, for enmity will presently befal between me and my father on thine account. So do not thou neglect to do aught that I shall say to thee, remembering all this betided me not save by reason of thee."" Hearing her words, Sharrkan joyed greatly; his breast broadened and his wits flew from him for delight, and he said, ""By Allah, none shall come at thee, while life is in my bosom! But hast thou patience to bear parting from thy parents and thy people?"" ""Even so,"" she answered; and Sharrkan swore to her and the two plighted their troth. Then said she, ""Now is my heart at ease; but there remaineth one other condition for thee."" ""What is it?"" asked he and she answered, ""It is that thou return with thy host to thine own country."" Quoth he, ""O lady mine, my father, King Omar bin al- Nu'uman, sent me to wage war upon thy sire, on account of the treasure he plundered from the King of Constantinople, and amongst the rest three great jewels, noted givers of good fortune."" Quoth she, ""Cheer thy heart and clear thine eyes: I will tell thee the whole of the tale and the cause of our feud with the King of Constantinople. Know that we have a yearly festival, highs the Convent Feast, whereat Kings from all quarters and the noblest women are wont to congregate; thither also come merchants and traders with their wives and families, and the visitors abide there seven days. I was wont to be one of them; but, when there befel enmity between us, my father forbade me to be present at the festival for the space of seven years. One year, it chanced that amongst the daughters of the great who resorted to the patron, as was their custom, came a daughter of the King of Constantinople, a beautiful girl called Sophia. They tarried at the monastery six days and on the seventh the folk went their ways;[FN#205] but Sophia said, 'I will not return to Constantinople save by water.' So they equipped for her a ship in which she embarked with her suite; and making sail they put out to sea; but as they were voyaging behold, a contrary wind caught them and drove the vessel from her course till, as Fate and Fortune would have it, she fell in with a Nazarene craft from the Camphor Island[FN#206] carrying a crew of five hundred armed Franks, who had been cruising about a long time. When they sighted the sails of the ship, wherein Sophia and her women were, they gave chase in all haste and in less than an hour they came up with her, then they laid the grappling irons aboard her and captured her. Then taking her in tow they made all sail for their own island and were but a little distant from it when the wind veered round and, splitting their sails, drove them on to a shoal which lies off our coast. Thereupon we sallied forth and, looking on them as spoil driven to us by Fate,[FN#207] boarded and took them; and, slaying the men, made prize of the wreck, wherein we found the treasures and rarities in question and forty maidens, amongst whom was the King's daughter, Sophia. After the capture we carried the Princess and her women to my father, not knowing her to be a daughter of King Afridun of Constantinople; and he chose out for himself ten including her; and divided the rest among his dependents. Presently he set apart five damsels, amongst whom was the King s daughter, and sent them to thy father, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, together with other gifts, such as broadcloth[FN#208] and woollen stuffs and Grecian silks. Thy father accepted them and chose out from amongst the five girls Sophia, daughter of King Afridun; nor did we hear more of her till the beginning of this year, when her father wrote to my father in words unfitting for me to repeat, rebuking him with menaces and saying to him: Two years ago, you plundered a ship of ours which had been seized by a band of Frankish pirates in which was my daughter, Sophia, attended by her maidens numbering some threescore. Yet ye informed me not thereof by messenger or otherwise; nor could I make the matter public, lest reproach befal me amongst the Kings, by reason of my daughter's honour. So I concealed my case till this year, when I wrote to certain Frankish corsairs and sought news of my daughter from the Kings of the Isles. They replied, 'By Allah we carried her not forth of thy realm; but we have heard that King Hardub rescued her from certain pirates. And they told me the whole tale.' Then he added in the writing which he writ to my father: 'Except you wish to be at feud with me and design to disgrace me and dishonour my daughter, you will, the instant my letter reacheth you, send my daughter back to me. But if you slight my letter and disobey my commandment, I will assuredly make you full return for your foul dealing and the baseness of your practices.'[FN#209] When my father read this letter and understood the contents,[FN#210] it vexed him and he regretted not having known that Sophia, King Afridun's daughter, was among the captured damsels, that he might have sent her back to her sire; and he was perplexed about the case because, after so long a time, he could not send to King Omar bin al-Nu'uman and demand her back from him, especially as he had lately heard that Heaven had granted him boon of babe by this Sophia. So when we pondered that truth, we knew that this letter was none other than a grievous calamity; and my father found nothing for it but to write an answer to King Afridun, making his excuses and swearing to him by strong oaths that he knew not his daughter to be among the bevy of damsels in the ship and setting forth how he had sent her to King Omar bin al Nu'uman, who had gotten the blessing of issue by her. When my father's reply reached King Afridun he rose up and sat down,[FN#211] and roared and foamed at the mouth crying:—'What! shall he take captive my daughter and even her with slave girls and pass her on from hand to hand sending her for a gift to Kings, and they lie with her without marriage contract? By the Messiah and the true Faith,' said he, 'I will not desist till I have taken my blood vengeance for this and have wiped out my shame; and indeed I will do a deed which the chroniclers shall chronicle after me!' So he bided his time till he devised a device and laid notable toils and snares, when he sent an embassy to thy father, King Omar, to tell him that which thou hast heard: accordingly thy father equipped thee and an army with thee and sent thee to King Afridun, whose object is to seize thee and thine army to boot. As for the three jewels whereof he told thy father when asking his aid, there was not one soothfast word in that matter, for they were with Sophia, his daughter; and my father took them from her, when he got possession of her and of her maidens, and gave them to me in free gift, and they are now with me. So go thou to thy host and turn them back ere they be led deep into, and shut in by, the land of the bevy of damsels in the ship and setting forth the Franks and the country of the Greeks; for as soon as you have come far enough into their interior, they will stop the roads upon you and there will be no escape for you till the Day of retribution and retaliation. I know that thy troops are still halting where thou leftest them, because thou didst order a three days' rest; withal they have missed thee all this time and they wot not what to do."" When Sharrkan heard her words, he was absent awhile in thought; then he kissed Princess Abrizah's hand and said, ""Praise be to Allah who hath bestowed thee on me and appointed thee to be the cause of my salvation and the salvation of whoso is with me! But 'tis grievous to me to part from thee and I know not what will become of thee after my departure."" ""Go now to thine army,"" she replied, ""and turn them back, while ye are yet near your own country. If the envoys be still with them, lay hands on them and keep them, that the case may be made manifest to you; and, after three days, I will be with you all and we will enter Baghdad together."" As he turned to depart she said, ""Forget not the compact which is between me and thee,"" then she rose to bid[FN#212] him farewell and embrace him and quench the fire of desire, so she took leave of him and, throwing her arms round his neck, wept with exceeding weeping, and repeated these verses,

""I bade adieu, my right hand wiped my tears away, * The while my
             left hand held her in a close embrace:
'Fearest thou naught,' quoth she, 'of shame?' I answered 'Nay, *
             The lover's parting day is lover's worst disgrace.'""

Then Sharrkan left her and walked down from the convent. They brought his steed, so he mounted and rode down stream to the drawbridge which he crossed and presently threaded the woodland paths and passed into the open meadow. As soon as he was clear of the trees he was aware of horsemen which made him stand on the alert, and he bared his brand and rode cautiously, but as they drew near and exchanged curious looks he recognized them and behold, it was the Wazir Dandan and two of his Emirs. When they saw him and knew him, they dismounted and saluting him, asked the reason of his absence; whereupon he told them all that had passed between him and Princess Abrizah from first to last. The Wazir returned thanks to Almighty Allah for his safety and said,[FN#213] ""Let us at once leave these lands; for the envoys who came with us are gone to inform the King of our approach, and haply he will hasten to fall on us and take us prisoners."" So Sharrkan cried to his men to saddle and mount, which they did and, setting out at once, they stinted not faring till they reached the sole of the valley wherein the host lay. The Ambassadors meanwhile had reported Sharrkan's approach to their King, who forthright equipped a host to lay hold of him and those with him. But Sharrkan, escorted by the Wazir Dandan and the two Emirs, had no sooner sighted the army, than he raised the cry ""March! March!"" They took horse on the instant and fared through the first day and second and third day, nor did they cease faring for five days; at the end of which time they alighted in a well wooded valley, where they rested awhile. Then they again set out and stayed not riding for five and twenty days which placed them on the frontiers of their own country. Here, deeming themselves safe, they halted to rest; and the country people came out to them with guest gifts for the men and provender and forage for the beasts. They tarried there two days after which, as all would be making for their homes, Sharrkan put the Wazir Dandan in command, bidding him lead the host back to Baghdad. But he himself remained behind with an hundred riders, till the rest of the army had made one day's march: then he called ""To horse!"" and mounted with his hundred men. They rode on two parasangs'[FN#214] space till they arrived at a gorge between two mountains and lo! there arose before them a dark cloud of sand and dust. So they checked their steeds awhile till the dust opened and lifted, discovering beneath it an hundred cavaliers, lion faced and in mail coats cased. As soon as they drew within earshot of Sharrkan and his meiny they cried out to them, saying, ""By the virtue of John and Mary, we have won to our wish! We have been following you by forced marches, night and day, till we forewent you to this place. So dismount and lay down your arms and yield yourselves, that we may grant you your lives."" When Sharrkan heard this, his eyes stood out from his head and his cheeks flushed red and he said 'How is it, O. Nazarene dogs, ye dare enter our country and overmatch our land? And doth not this suffice you, but ye must adventure yourselves and address us in such unseemly speech? Do you think to escape out of our hands and return to your country?"" Then he shouted to his hundred horsemen, ""Up and at these hounds, for they even you in number!"" So saying, he bared his sabre and bore down on them, he and his, but the Franks met them with hearts firmer than rocks, and wight dashed against wight, and knight dashed upon knight, and hot waxed the fight, and sore was the affright, and nor parley nor cries of quarter helped their plight; and they stinted not to charge and to smite, right hand meeting right, nor to hack and hew with blades bright white, till day turned to night and gloom oppressed the sight. Then they drew apart and Sharrkan mustered his men and found none wounded save four only, who showed hurts but not death hurts. Said he to them, ""By Allah, my life long have I waded in the clashing sea of fight and I have met many a gallant sprite, but none so unfrightened of the sword that smites and the shock of men that affrights like these valiant Knights!"" ""Know, O King,"" said they, that there is among them a Frankish cavalier who is their leader and, indeed, he is a man of valour and fatal is his spear thrust: but, by Allah, he spares us great and small; for whoso falls into his hands he lets him go and forbears to slay him. By Allah, had he willed he had killed us all."" Sharrkan was astounded when he heard what the Knight had done and such high report of him, so he said, ""When the morn shall morrow, we will draw out and defy them, for we are an hundred to their hundred; and we will seek aid against them from the Lord of the Heavens."" So they rested that night in such intent; whilst the Franks gathered round their Captain and said, ""Verily this day we did not win our will of these;"" and he replied, ""At early dawn when the morrow shall morn, we will draw out and challenge them, one after one."" They also rested in that mind, and both camps kept guard until Almighty Allah sent the light of day dawn. Thereupon King Sharrkan and his hundred riders took horse and rode forth to the plain, where they found the Franks ranged in line of battle; and Sharrkan said to his followers, ""Our foes have determined like ourselves to do their devoir; so up and at them and lay on load."" Then came forth an Herald of the Franks and cried out, saying, ""Let there be no general engagement betwixt us this day, save by the duello, a champion of yours against a champion of ours."" Whereupon one of Sharrkan's riders dashed out from the ranks and crave between the two lines crying, ""Ho! who is for smiting? Let no dastard engage me this day nor niderling!"" Hardly had he made an end of his vaunt, when there sallied forth to him a Frankish cavalier, armed cap-à-pie and clad in a surcoat of gold stuff, riding on a grey white steed,[FN#215] and he had no hair on his cheeks. He urged his charger on to the midst of the battle plain and the two fell to derring do of cut and thrust, but it was not long before the Frank foined the Moslem with the lance point; and, toppling him from his steed, took him prisoner and led him off crestfallen. His folk rejoiced in their comrade and, forbidding him to go out again to the field, sent forth another, to whom sallied out another Moslem, brother to the captive, and offered him battle. The two fell to, either against other, and fought for a little while, till the Frank bore down upon the Moslem and, falsing him with a feint, tumbled him by a thrust of the lance heel from his destrier and took him prisoner. After this fashion the Moslems ceased not dashing forwards, one after one, and the Franks to unhorse them and take them captive, till day departed and the night with darkness upstarted. Now they had captured of the Moslems twenty cavaliers, and when Sharrken saw this, it was grievous to him and he mustered his men and said to them, ""What is this thing that hath befallen us? To- morrow, I myself will go forth to the field and offer singular combat to their chief and learn what is the cause of his entering our land and warn him against doing battle with our band. If he persist, we will punish him with death, and if he prove peaceable we will make peace with him."" They righted on this wise till Allah Almighty caused the morn to dawn, when mounted the twain and drew up for battle fain; and Sharrkan was going forth to the plain, but behold, more than one half of the Franks dismounted and remained on foot before one of them who was mounted, till they reached the midst of the battle plain. Sharrken looked at that horseman and lo! he was their chief. He was clad in a surcoat of blue satin and a close ringed mail shirt; his face was as the moon when it rises and no hair was upon his cheeks. He hent in hand an Indian scymitar and he rode a sable steed with a white blaze on brow, like a dirham; and he smote the horse with heel till he stood almost in the midst of the field when, signing to the Moslems, he cried out in fluent Arab speech ""Ho, Sharrkan! Ho, son of Omar bin al- Nu'uman! Ho, thou who forcest fortalice and overthrowest cities and countries! up and out to battle bout, and blade single handed wield with one who halves with thee the field! Thou art Prince of thy people and I am Prince of mine; and whoso overcometh his adversary, him let the other's men obey and come under his sway."" Hardly had he ended his speech, when out came Sharrkan with a heart full of fury, and urging his steed into the midst of the field, closed like a raging lion with the Frank who encountered him with wariness and steadfastness and met him with the meeting of warriors. Then they fell to foining and hewing, and they stinted not of onset and offset, and give and take, as they were two mountains clashing together or two seas together dashing; nor did they cease fighting until day darkened and night starkened. Then they drew apart and each returned to his own party; but as soon as Sharrkan foregathered with his comrades, he said, ""Never looked I on the like of this cavalier: he hath one quality I have not yet seen in any and this it is that, when his foemen uncovereth a place for the death blow, he reverseth his weapon and smiteth with the lance-heel! In very deed I know not what will be the issue 'twixt him and me; but 'tis my wish that we had in our host his like and the like of his men."" Then he went to his rest for the night and, when morning dawned, the Frank came forth and rode down to the mid field, where Sharrkan met him; and they fell to fighting and to wheeling, left and right; and necks were stretched out to see the sight, nor did they stint from strife and sword play and lunge of lance with main and might, till the day turned to night and darkness overwhelmed the light. Then the twain drew asunder and returned each to his own camp, where both related to their comrades what had befallen them in the duello; and at last the Frank said to his men, ""Tomorrow shall decide the matter!"" So they both passed that night restfully till dawn; and, as soon as it was day, they mounted and each bore down on other and ceased not to fight till half the day was done. Then the Frank bethought him of a ruse; first urging his steed with heel and then checking him with the rein, so that he stumbled and fell with his rider; thereupon Sharrkan threw himself on the foe, and would have smitten him with the sword fearing lest the strife be prolonged, when the Frank cried out to him, ""O Sharrkan, champions are not wont to do thus! This is the act of a man accustomed to be beaten by a woman.""[FN#216] When Sharrkan heard this, he raised his eyes to the Frank's face and gazing steadfastly at him, recognized in him Princess Abrizah with whom that pleasant adventure had befallen him in the convent; whereupon he cast brand from hand and, kissing the earth before her, asked her, ""What moved thee to a deed like this?""; and she answered, ""I desired to prove thy prowess afield and test thy doughtiness in tilting and jousting. These that are with me are my handmaids, and they are all clean maids; yet they have vanquished thy horsemen in fair press and stress of plain; and had not my steed stumbled with me, thou shouldst have seen my might and prowess in combat."" Sharrkan smiled at her speech and said, ""Praise be to Allah for safety and for my reunion with thee, O Queen of the age!"" Then she cried out to her damsels to loose the twenty captives of Sharrkan's troop and dismount. They did as she bade and came and kissed the earth before her and Sharrkan who said to them, ""It is the like of you that Kings keep in store for the need hour."" Then he signed to his comrades to salute the Princess; so all alighted and kissed the earth before her, for they knew the story. After this, the whole two hundred took horse, and fared on night and day for six days' space, till they drew near to Baghdad, when they halted and Sharrkan bade Abrizah and her handmaids doff the Frankish garb that was on them,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Fifty-first Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkan bade Princess Abrizah and her damsels doff the garb that was on them and don the garments of daughters of Greece; and thus did they. Then he despatched a company of his companions to Baghdad to acquaint his father Omar bin al-Nu'uman, with his arrival and report that he was accompanied by Princess Abrizah, daughter of King Hardub, Lord of Graecia-land. They halted forthright in the place they had reached, and Sharrkan also halted and all righted there; and when Almighty Allah made morning dawn, Sharrkan and his company and Abrizah and her company took horse and fared on towards the city; when lo! on the way they met the Wazir Dandan, who had come out amongst a thousand horse to honour Abrizah and Sharrkan, by especial commandment of King Omar Son of Al- Nu'uman. When the two drew near, they turned towards them and kissed ground before them; then they mounted again and escorted them into the city and went up with them to the palace. Sharrkan walked in to his father, who rose and embraced him and questioned him of his case. So he told him all that Abrizah had told him, and what had passed between them and said, ""She hath parted from her sire and departed from her reign and hath chosen to take part with us and make her abode with us; and indeed,"" he said to his father, ""the King of Constantinople hath plotted to do us a mischief, because of his daughter Sophia, for that the King of Greece had made known to him her story and the cause of her being given to thee; and he (the Grecian King) not knowing her to be daughter of King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople; and, had he known that, he would not have bestowed her upon thee, but he would have restored her to her parent. And of a verity,"" he continued, ""we were saved from these perils only by the Lady Abrizah, and never saw we a more valiant than she."" And he went on to tell his father all that had passed from first to last of the wrestling and the single fighting. When King Omar heard the story of Sharrkan, Abrizah was exalted in his eyes, and he longed to see her and question her. Thereupon Sharrkan went out to her and said, ""The King calleth for thee;"" she replied, ""I hear and I obey;"" and he took her and brought her in to his father, who was seated on his throne and who, having dismissed his high officers, was attended only by his eunuchs. The Princess entered and kissing the ground between his hands, saluted him in choice terms. He was amazed at her eloquent speech and thanked her for her dealing with his son Sharrkan and bade her be seated. So she sat down and unveiled her face;[FN#217] and, when the King saw her beauty, his reason fled his head and he made her draw near and showed her favour, appointing her an especial palace for herself and her damsels, and assigning them solde and allowances. Then began he to ask her of the three jewels aforesaid, and she answered, ""Here be they with me, O King of the age!"" So saying, she rose and going to her lodging, unpacked her baggage and from it brought out a box and from the box a casket of gold. She opened the casket and taking out those three jewels, kissed them and gave them to the King. Then she went away bearing his heart with her. After her going the King sent for his son Sharrkan and gave him one jewel of the three, and when he enquired of the other two replied, ""O my son! I mean to give one to thy brother Zau al-Makan, and the other to thy sister Nuzhat al- Zaman."" But when Sharrkan heard that he had a brother (for to that time he knew only of his sister) he turned to his sire and said to him, ""O King, hast thou a son other than myself?"" He answered, ""Yes, and he is now six years old;"" adding that his name was Zau al- Makan and that he and Nuzhat al-Zaman were twins, born at a birth. This news was grievous to Sharrkan, but he kept his secret and said, ""The bless- ing of Allah Most High be upon them!"", and he cast the jewel from his hand and shook the dust off his clothes. Quoth the King, ""How do I see thee change thy manner when hearing of this, considering that after me thou becomes"" heir of the kingdom. Of a truth the troops have sworn to thee and the Emirs and Grandees have taken the oath of succession to thee; and this one of the three jewels is thine."" Sharrkan bowed his head to the ground and was ashamed to bandy words with his parent so he accepted the jewel and went away, knowing not what to do for exceeding wrath, and stayed not walking till he had entered Abrizah's palace. As he approached she stood up to meet him and thanked him for what he had done and prayed for blessings on him and his sire. Then she sat down and seated him by her side; but when he had taken his place she saw rage in his face and questioned him, whereupon he told her that Allah had blessed his father with two children by Sophia, a boy and a girl, and that he had named the boy Zau al-Makan and the girl Nuzhat al-Zaman; adding, ""He hath kept the other two jewels for them and hath given me one of thine, so I left it behind; I knew naught of Zau al-Makan's birth till this day, and the twain are now six years old. So when I learnt this, wrath possessed me; and I tell thee the reason of my rage and hide nothing from thee. But now I fear lest my father take thee to wife, for he loveth thee and I saw in him signs of desire for thee: so what wilt thou say, if he wish this?"" Quoth she, ""Know, O Sharrkan, that thy father hath no dominion over me, nor can he have me without my consent; and if he prevail over me by force, I will take my own life. As for the three jewels, it was not my intent that he should give any of them to either of his children and I had no thought but that he would lay them up in his treasury with his things of price; but now I desire of thy favour that thou make me a present of the jewel which he gave thee, if thou have accepted it."" ""Hearkening and obedience,"" replied Sharrkan, and gave it to her. Then said she, ""Fear nothing,"" and talked with him awhile and continued, ""I fear lest my father hear that I am with you and sit not patiently under my loss, but do his endeavours to find me; and to that end he may ally himself with King Afridun, on account of his daughter Sophia, and both come on thee with armies and so there befal great turmoil."" When Sharrken heard these words, he said to her, ""O my lady, if it please thee to sojourn with us, take no thought of them; though there gather together against us all that be on land and on sea."" "" 'Tis well,"" rejoined she; ""if ye entreat me fair, I will tarry with you, and if ye deal evilly by me, I will depart from you."" Then she bade her slave maidens bring food; so they set the tables, and Sharrkan ate a little and went away to his own house, disturbed and perturbed. Such was his case; but regarding the affairs of his father, Omar bin al-Nu'uman, after dismissing his son Sharrkan he arose and, taking the other two jewels, betook himself to the Lady Sophia, who stood up when she saw him and remained standing till he was seated. Presently, his two children, Zau al-Makan and Nuzhat al-Zaman, came to him and he kissed them and hung a jewel round each one's neck, at which they rejoiced and kissed his hands. Then went they to their mother, who joyed in their joy and wished the King long life; so he asked her, ""Why hast thou not informed me all this time that thou art the daughter of King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople, that I might have honoured thee still more and enlarged thee in dignity and raised thy rank?"" ""O King,"" answered Sophia, ""and what could I desire greater or higher than this my standing with thee, overwhelmed as I am with thy favours and thy benefits? And, furthermore, Allah hath blessed me with two children by thee, a son and a daughter."" Her reply pleased the King and after leaving her, he set apart for her and her children a wondrous fine palace. Moreover, he appointed for them eunuchs and attendants and doctors of law and doctors of philosophy and astrologers and physicians and surgeons to do them service; and in every way he redoubled his favour and entreated them with the best of treatment. And presently he returned to the palace of his dominion and to his Court where he distributed justice among the lieges. So far concerning him and Sophia and her children; but in the matter of Abrizah the King was greatly occupied with love of her and burnt with desire of her night and day; and every night, he would go in to her and converse with her and pay his court to her, but she gave him no answer, only saying, ""O King of the age! I have no desire for men at this present."" When he saw her withdraw from him, his passion waxed hotter and his longing and pining increased until, when weary of this, he summoned his Wazir Dandan and, opening his very heart to him, told him of his love for Princess Abrizah, daughter of Hardub, and informed him how she refused to yield to his wishes and how desire for her was doing him to die, for that he could get no grace of her. The Wazir, hearing these words, said to the King, ""As soon as it is dark night, take thou a piece of Bhang the measure of a miskal, about an ounce, and go in to her and drink somewhat of wine with her. When the hour of ending the carousel shall draw near, fill her a last cup and dropping therein the Bhang, give it to her to drink, and she will not reach her sleeping chamber ere the drug take effect on her. Then do thou go in to her and take thy will of her; and such is my advice.""[FN#218] ""Thy rede is aright,"" quoth the King, and seeking his treasury, he took thence a piece of concentrated Bhang, if an elephant smelt it he would sleep from year to year. This he put in his bosom pocket and waited till some little of the night went by, when he betook himself to the palace of Princess Abrizah, who seeing him stood up to receive him; but he bade her sit down. So she sat down, and he sat by her, and he began to talk with her of wine and wassail, whereupon she furnished the carousing table[FN#219] and placed it before him. Then she set on the drinking vessels and lighted the candles and ordered to bring dried fruits and sweet meats and all that pertaineth to drinking. So they fell to tippling and the King ceased not to pledge her till drunkenness crept into her head; and seeing this he took out the bit of Bhang from his pocket and, holding it between his fingers, filled a cup with his own hand and drank it off. Then filling a second he said, ""To thy companionship!""; and dropped the drug into her cup, she knowing naught of it. She took it and drank it off; then she rose and went to her sleeping chamber. He waited for less than an hour till he was assured that the dose had taken effect on her and had robbed her of her senses, when he went in to her and found her thrown on her back: and she had doffed her petticoat trousers and the air raised the skirt of her shift and discovered what was between her thighs. When the King saw the state of things and found a lighted candle at her head and another at her feet, shining upon what her thighs enshrined he took leave of his five senses for lust and Satan seduced him and he could not master himself, but put off his trousers and fell upon her and abated her maiden head. Then he rose off her and went to one of her women, by name Marjánah, and said, ""Go in to thy lady and speak with her."" So she went in to her mistress and found her lying on her back insensible, with the blood running down to the calves of her legs, whereupon she took a kerchief and wiped away the blood and lay by her that night. As soon as Almighty Allah brought the dawn, the handmaid Marjanah washed her mistress's hands and feet and brought rose water and bathed her face and mouth with it, where upon she sneezed and yawned and cast up from her inside that bit of Bhang like a bolus.[FN#220] Then she revived and washed her hands and mouth and said to Marjanah, ""Tell me what hath befallen me."" So she told her what had passed and how she had found her, lying on her back, with the blood running down, wherefore she knew that King Omar bin al-Nu'uman had lain with her and had undone her and taken his will of her. At this she grieved with exceeding grief and retired into privacy, saying to her damsels, ""Deny me to whoso would come in to me and say to him that I am ill, till I see what Allah will do with me."" Presently the news of her sickness came to the King; so he sent her sherbets and sugar electuaries. Some months she thus passed in solitude, during which time the King's flame cooled and his desire for her was quenched, so that he abstained from her. Now she had conceived by him, and when the months of child breeding had gone by, her pregnancy appeared and her belly swelled, and the world was straitened upon her, so she said to her handmaid Marjanah, ""Know that it is not the folk who have wronged me, but I who sinned against my own self[FN#221] in that I left my father and mother and country. Indeed, I abhor life, for my spirit is broken and neither courage nor strength is left me. I used, when I mounted my steed, to have the mastery of him, but now I am unable to ride. If I be brought to bed among them I shall be dishonoured before my hand women and every one in the palace will know that he hath taken my maidenhead in the way of shame; and if I return to my father, with what face shall I meet him or with what face shall I have recourse to him? How well quoth the poet,

'Say, what shall solace one who hath nor home nor stable stead *
             Nor cup companion, nor a cup, nor place to house his head?'""

Marjanah answered her, ""It is thine to command; I will obey;"" and Abrizah said, ""I desire at once to leave this place secretly, so that none shall know of me but thou; and return to my father and my mother, for when flesh stinketh, there is naught for it but its own folk and Allah shall do with me e'en as He will."" ""O Princess,"" Marjanah replied, ""what thou wouldest do is well."" Then she made matters ready and kept her secret and waited for some days till the King went out to chase and hunt, and his son Sharrkan betook himself to certain of the fortresses to sojourn there awhile. Then said she to Marjanah, ""I wish to set out this night, but how shall I do against my destiny? For already I feel the pangs of labour and child birth, and if I abide other four or five days, I shall be brought to bed here, and I shall be unable to travel to my country. But this is what was written on my forehead."" Then she considered awhile, and said to Marjanah, ""Look us out a man who will go with us and serve us by the way, for I have no strength to bear arms."" ""By Allah, O my lady,"" replied Marjanah, ""I know none but a black slave called Al- Ghazbán,[FN#222] who is one of the slaves of King Omar bin al- Nu'uman; he is a valiant wight, and he keepeth guard at our palace gate. The King appointed him to attend us, and indeed we have overwhelmed him with our favours; so, lookye, I will go out and speak with him of this matter, and promise him some monies and tell him that, if he have a mind to tarry with us, I will marry him to whom he will. He told me before to day that he had been a highwayman; so if he consent to us we shall win our wish and reach to our own land."" She rejoined, ""Call him that I may talk with him;"" whereupon Marjanah fared forth and said to the slave, 'O Ghazban, Allah prosper thee, so thou fall in with what my lady saith to thee!"" Then she took him by the hand and brought him to the Princess, whose hands he kissed but as she beheld him, her heart took fright at him. ""How ever,"" she said to herself, ""of a truth, Need giveth the law;"" and she approached to speak with him, yet her heart started away from him. Presently she said, ""O Ghazban, say me, wilt thou help me against the perfidies of Fortune and conceal my secret if I discover it to thee?"" When the slave saw her, his heart was taken by storm and he fell in love with her forthright and could not but reply; ""O my mistress, whatsoever thou biddest me do, I will not depart therefrom."" Quoth she, ""I would have thee take me at this hour and take this my handmaid and saddle us two camels and two of the King's horses and set on each horse a saddle bag of goods and somewhat of provaunt, and go with us to our own country; where, if thou desire to abide with us, I will marry thee to her thou shalt choose of my handmaidens, or, if thou prefer return to thine own land, we will marry thee and give thee whatso thou desires"" after thou hast taken of money what shall satisfy thee."" When Al Ghazban, heard this, he rejoiced with great joy and replied, ""O my lady, I will serve both of you with mine eyes and will go at once and saddle the horses."" Then he went away gladsome and saying to himself, ""I shall get my will of them and if they will not yield to me, I will kill them both and take their riches."" But he kept this his intent to himself, and presently returned with two camels and three head of horses, one of which he rode, and Princess Abrizah made Marjanah mount the second she mounting the third, albeit she was in labour pains and possessed not her soul for anguish. And the slave ceased not travelling with them night and day through the passes of the mountains, till there remained but musingly march between them and their own country; when the travail pangs came upon Abrizah and she could no longer resist; so she said to Al-Ghazban, ""Set me down, for the pains of labour are upon me;"" and cried to Marjanah, ""Do thou alight and sit by me and deliver me."" Then Marjanah dismounted from her horse, and Al-Ghazban did in like sort, and they made fast the bridles and helped the Princess to dismount, for she was aswoon from excess of anguish. When Al-Ghazban saw her on the ground, Satan entered into him and he drew his falchion and brandishing it in her face, said ""O my lady, vouchsafe me thy favours."" Hearing these words she turned to him and said, ""It remaineth for me only that I yield me to negro slaves, after having refused Kings and Braves!""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Fifty-second Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Princess Abrizah said to the black slave Al Ghazban, ""It remaineth for me only that I yield me to negro slaves, after having refused Kings and Braves!"" And she was wroth with him and cried, ""Woe to thee! what words are these thou sayest? Out on thee, and talk not thus in my presence and know that I will never consent to what thou sayest, though I drink the cup of death. Wait till I have cast my burden and am delivered of the after birth, and then, if thou be able thereto, do with me as thou wilt; but, an thou leave not lewd talk at this time assuredly I will slay myself with my own hand and quit the world and be at peace from all this."" And she began reciting extempore,[FN#223]

""O spare me, thou Ghazban, indeed enow for me * Are heavy strokes
            of time, mischance and misery!
Whoredom my Lord forfends to all humanity; * Quoth He, 'Who
           breaks my bidding Hell for home shall see!'
And if thou leave not suing me to whoredom's way * Against th'
          Almighty's choicest gift, my chastity,
Upon my tribesmen I with might and main will call * And gather
          all, however far or near they be;
And with Yamáni blade were I in pieces hewn, * Ne'er shall he
           sight my face who makes for villeiny,
The face of free born come of noble folk and brave; * What then
            can be to me the seed of whoreson slave?""

When Ghazban heard these lines he was wroth exceedingly; his eyes reddened with blood and his face became a dusty grey[FN#224]; his nostrils swelled, his lips protruded and the repulsiveness of his aspect redoubled. And he repeated these couplets,

""Ho thou, Abrizah, mercy! leave me not for I * Of thy love and
             Yamáni[FN#225] glance the victim lie
My heart is cut to pieces by thy cruelty, * My body wasted and my
                   patience done to die:
From glances ravishing all hearts with witchery * Reason far
           flies, the while desire to thee draws nigh;
Though at thy call should armies fill the face of earth * E'en
           now I'd win my wish and worlds in arms defy!""

When Abrizah heard these words, she wept with sore weeping and said to him, ""Woe to thee, O Ghazban! How dareth the like of thee to address me such demand, O base born and obscene bred? Dost thou deem all folk are alike?"" When the vile slave heard this from her, he waxt more enraged and his eyes grew redder: and he came up to her and smiting her with the sword on her neck wounded her to the death. Then he drove her horse before him with the treasure and made off with himself to the mountains. Such was the case with Al-Ghazban; but as regards Abrizah, she gave birth to a son, like the moon, and Marjanah took the babe and did him the necessary offices and laid him by his mother's side; and lo and behold! the child fastened to its mother's breast and she dying.[FN#226] When Marjanah saw this, she cried out with a grievous cry and rent her raiment and cast dust on her head and buffeted her cheeks till blood flowed, saying, ""Alas, my mistress! Alas, the pity of it! Thou art dead by the hand of a worthless black slave, after all thy knightly prowess!"" And she ceased not weeping when suddenly a great cloud of dust arose and walled the horizon;[FN#227] but, after awhile, it lifted and discovered a numerous conquering host. Now this was the army of King Hardub, Princess Abrizah's father, and the cause of his coming was that when he heard of his daughter and her handmaids having fled to Baghdad, and that they were with King Omar bin al- Nu'uman, he had come forth, leading those with him, to seek tidings of her from travellers who might have seen her with the King. When he had gone a single day's march from his capital, he espied three horse men afar off and made towards them, intending to ask whence they came and seek news of his daughter. Now these three whom he saw at a distance were his daughter and Marjanah and the slave Al- Ghazban; and he made for them to push inquiry. Seeing this the villain blackamoor feared for himself; so he killed Abrizah and fled for his life. When they came up, King Hardub saw his daughter lying dead and Marjanah weeping over her, and he threw himself from his steed and fell fainting to the ground. All the riders of his company, the Emirs and Waxirs, took foot and forth right pitched their tents on the mountain and set up for the King a great pavilion, domed and circular, without which stood the grandees of the realm. When Marjanah saw her master, she at once recognized him and her tears redoubled; and, when he came to himself, he questioned her and she told him all that had passed and said, ""Of a truth he that hath slain thy daughter is a black slave belonging to King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, and she informed him how Sharrkan's father had dealt with the Princess. When King Hardub heard this, the world grew black in his sight and he wept with sore weeping. Then he called for a litter and, therein laying his dead daughter, returned to Caesarea and carried her into the palace, where he went in to his mother, Zat al-Dawahi, and said to that Lady of Calamities, ""Shall the Moslems deal thus with my girl? Verily King Omar bin al-Nu'uman despoiled her of her honour by force, and after this, one of his black slaves slew her. By the truth of the Messiah, I will assuredly take blood revenge for my daughter and clear away from mine honour the stain of shame; else will I kill myself with mine own hand!"" And he wept passing sore. Quoth his mother, ""None other than Marjanah killed thy daughter, for she hated her in secret;"" and she continued to her son, ""Fret not for taking the blood wit of thy daughter, for, by the truth of the Messiah, I will not turn back from King Omar bin al-Nu'uman till I have slain him and his sons; and of a very truth I will do with him a deed, passing the power of Sage and Knight, whereof the chroniclers shall tell chronicles in all countries and in every place: but needs must thou do my bidding in all I shall direct, for whoso be firmly set on the object of his desire shall surely compass his desire."" ""By the virtue of the Messiah,"" replied he, ""I will not cross thee in aught thou shalt say."" Then quoth she, ""Bring me a number of hand maids, high bosomed virgins, and summon the wise men of the age and let them teach them philosophy and the rules of behaviour before Kings, and the art of conversation and making verses; and let them talk with them of all manner science and edifying knowledge. And the sages must be Moslems, that they may teach them the language and traditions of the Arabs, together with the history of the Caliphs and the ancient annals of the Kings of Al-Islam; and if we persevere in this for four years' space, we shall gain our case. So possess thy soul in patience and wait; for one of the Arabs saith, 'If we take man bote after years forty the time were short to ye.' When we have taught the girls these things, we shall be able to work our will with our foe, for he doteth on women and he hath three hundred and sixty concubines, whereto are now added an hundred of the flowers of thy handmaidens who were with thy daughter, she that hath found mercy.[FN#228] As soon as I have made an end of their education, as described to thee, I will take them and set out with them in person."" When King Hardub heard his mother's words, he rejoiced and arose and kissed her head; and at once despatched messengers and couriers to lands sundry and manifold to fetch him Moslem sages. They obeyed his commands and fared to far countries and thence brought him the sages and the doctors he sought. When these came into presence, he honoured them with notable honorurs and bestowed dresses on them and appointed to them stipends and allowances and promised them much money whenas they should have taught the damsels. Then he committed the handmaidens to their hands—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Fifty-third Night.

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the sages and the doctors stood in presence of King Hardub, he honoured them with notable honours and committed the hand maidens to their hands, enjoining that these be instructed in all manner of knowledge, philosophy and polite accomplishments; and they set themselves to do his bidding. Such was the case with King Hardub; but as for King Omar bin al Nu'uman, when he returned from coursing and hunting and entered his palace, he sought Princess Abrizah but found her not, nor any one knew of her nor could any give him news of her. This was grievous to him and he said, ""How could the lady leave the palace unknown of any? Had my kingdom been at stake in this case, it were in perilous condition there being none to govern it! I will never again go to sport and hunt till I have stationed at the gates those who shall keep good guard over them!"" And he was sore vexed and his breast was straitened for the loss of Princess Abrizah. Hereupon behold, his son Sharrkan returned from his journey; and the father told him what had happened, and informed him how the lady had fled, whilst he was chasing and hunting, whereat he grieved with exceeding grief. Then King Omar took to visiting his children every day and making much of them and brought them learned men and doctors to teach them, appointing for them stipends. When Sharrkan saw this, he raged with exceeding rage and envied thereupon his brother and sister till the signs of chagrin appeared in his face and he ceased not to languish by reason of this matter: so one day his father said to him, ""Why do I see thee grown weak in body and yellow of face?"" ""O my father,"" replied Sharrkan, ""every time I see thee fondle my brother and sister and make much of them, jealousy seizeth on me, and I fear lest it grow on me till I slay them and thou slay me in return. And this is the reason of my weakness of body and change of complexion. But now I crave of thy favour that thou give me one of thy castles outlying the rest, that I may abide there the remnant of my life, for as the sayer of bywords saith, 'Absence from my friend is better and fitter for me'; and, 'Whatso eye doth not perceive, that garreth not heart to grieve.'"" And he bowed his head towards the ground. When King Omar bin al-Nu'uman heard his words and knew the cause of his ailment and of his being broken down, he soothed his heart and said to him, ""O my son, I grant thee this and I have not in my reign a greater than the Castle of Damascus, and the government of it is thine from this time."" Thereupon he forthright summoned his secretaries of state and bade them write Sharrkan's patent of investiture to the viceroyalty of Damascus of Syria. And when they had written it, he equipped him and sent with him the Wazir Dandan, and invested him with the rule and government and gave him instructions as to policy and regulations; and took leave of him, and the grandees and officers of state did likewise, and he set out with his host. When he arrived at Damascus, the townspeople beat the drums and blew the trumpets and decorated the city and came out to meet him in great state; whilst all the notables and grandees paced in procession, and those who stood to the right of the throne walked on his right flank, and the others to the left. Thus far concerning Sharrkan; but as regards his father, Omar bin al- Nu'uman, soon after the departure of his son, the children's tutors and governors presented themselves before him and said to him, ""O our lord, thy children have now learnt knowledge and they are completely versed in the rules of manners and the etiquette of ceremony."" The King rejoiced thereat with exceeding joy and conferred bountiful largesse upon the learned men, seeing Zau al- Makan grown up and flourishing and skilled in horsemanship. The Prince had reached the age of fourteen and he occupied himself with piety and prayers, loving the poor, the Olema and the Koran students, so that all the people of Baghdad loved him, men and women. One day, the procession of the Mahmil[FN#229] of Irák passed round Baghdad before its departure for the pilgrimage to Meccah and visitation of the tomb of the Prophet (whom Allah bless and preserve!). When Zau al-Makan the Mahmil procession he was seized with longing desire to become a pilgrim,[FN#230] so he went in to his sire and said, ""I come to ask thy leave to make the pilgrimage."" But his father forbade him saying, ""Wait till next year and I will go and thou too."" When the Prince saw that the matter was postponed, he betook himself to his sister Nuzhat al-Zaman, whom he found standing at prayer. As soon as she had ended her devotions he said to her, ""I am dying with desire of pilgrimage to the Holy House of Allah at Meccah and to visit the tomb of the Prophet, upon whom be peace! I asked my father's leave, but he forbade me that, so I mean to take privily somewhat of money and set out on the pilgrimage without his knowledge."" ""Allah upon thee,"" exclaimed she, ""take me with thee and deprive me not of visitation to the tomb of the Prophet, whom Allah bless and keep!"" And he answered, ""As soon as it is dark night, do thou come forth from this place, without telling any."" Accordingly,When it was the middle of the night she arose and took somewhat of money and donned a man's habit; and she ceased not walking to the palace gate, where she found Zau al-Makan with camels ready for marching. So he mounted and mounted her; and the two fared on till they were in the midst of the Iraki[FN#231] pilgrim-party, and they ceased not marching and Allah wrote safety for them, till they entered Meccah the Holy and stood upon Arafát and performed the pilgrimage rites. Then they made a visitation to the tomb of the Prophet (whom Allah bless and assain!) and thought to return with the pilgrims to their native land. But Zau al-Makan said to his sister, ""O my sister, it is in my mind to visit the Holy House,[FN#232] Jerusalem, and Abraham the Friend of Allah[FN#233] (on whom be peace!)."" ""I also desire so to do,"" replied she. So they agreed upon this and he fared forth and took passage for himself and her and they made ready and set out in the ship with a company of Jerusalem palmers. That very night the sister fell sick of an aguish chill, and was grievously ill but presently recovered, after which the brother also sickened. She tended him during his malady and they ceased not wayfaring till they arrived at Jerusalem, but the fever increased on him and he grew weaker and weaker. They alighted at a Khan and there hired a lodging; but Zau al- Makan's sickness ceased not to increase on him, till he was wasted with leanness and became delirious. At this, his sister was greatly afflicted and exclaimed, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! This is the decree of Allah!"" They sojourned in that place awhile, his weakness ever increasing and she attending him and buying necessaries for him and for herself, till all the money she had was expended and she became so poor that she had not so much as a dirham left. Then she sent a servant of the Khan to the bazar with some of her clothes, and he sold them and she spent the price upon her brother; then sold she something more and she ceased not selling all she had, piece by piece, till nothing was left but an old rug. Whereupon she wept and exclaimed, ""Verily is Allah the Orderer of the past and the future!"" Presently her brother said to her, ""O my sister, I feel recovery drawing near and my heart longeth for a little roast meat."" ""By Allah! O my brother,"" replied she, ""I have no face to beg; but tomorrow I will enter some rich man's house and serve him and earn somewhat for our living."" Then she bethought herself awhile and said, ""Of a truth 'tis hard for me to leave thee and thou in this state, but I must despite myself!"" He rejoined, ""Allah forbid! Thou wilt be put to shame; but there is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah!"" And he wept and she wept too. Then she said, ""O my brother, we are strangers who have dwelt here a full year, but none hath yet knocked at our door. Shall we then die of hunger? I know no resource but that I go out and do service and earn somewhat to keep us alive, till thou recover from thy sickness, when we will travel back to our native land."" She sat weeping awhile and he wept too, propped upon his elbow. Then Nuzhat al-Zaman arose and, veiling her head with a bit of camlet,[FN#234] which had been of the cameleer's clothes and which the owner had forgotten and left with them; she kissed the head of her brother and embraced him and went forth from him, weeping and knowing not whither she should wend. And she stinted not going and her brother Zau al-Makan awaiting her return till the supper time; but she came not, and he watched for her till the morning morrowed but still she returned not; and this endured till two days went by. He was greatly troubled thereat and his heart fluttered for her, and hunger was sore upon him. At last he left the chamber and, calling the servant of the caravanserai, said, ""I wish thee to bear me to the bazar."" So he carried him to the market street and laid him down there; and the people of Jerusalem gathered round him and were moved to tears seeing his condition. He signed to them begging for somewhat to eat; so they brought him some money from certain of the merchants who were in the bazar, and bought food and fed him therewith; after which they carried him to a shop, where they spread him a mat of palm leaves and set an ewer of water at his head. When night fell, all the folk went away, sore concerned for him and, in the middle of the night, he called to mind his sister and his sickness redoubled on him, so that he abstained from eating and drinking and became insensible to the world around him. Then the bazar people arose and took for him from the merchants thirty seven dirhams, and hiring a camel, said to the driver, ""Carry this sick man to Damascus and leave him in the hospital; haply he may be cured and recover health."" ""On my head be it!"" replied the camel man; but he said to himself, ""How shall I take this sick man to Damascus, and he nigh upon death?"" So he carried him away to a place and hid with him till the night, when he threw him down on the ash heap near the fire hole of a Hammam and went his way. When morning dawned the Stoker[FN#235] of the bath came to his work and, finding Zau al-Makan cast on his back, exclaimed, ""Why did they not throw their dead body anywhere but here?"" So saying, he gave him a kick and he moved; whereupon quoth the Fireman, ""Some one of you who hath eaten a bit of Hashish and hath thrown himself down in whatso place it be!"" Then he looked at his face and saw his hairless cheeks and his grace and comeliness; so he took pity on him and knew that he was sick and a stranger in the land. And he cried, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah! verily, I have sinned against this youth, for indeed the Prophet (whom Allah bless and keep!) enjoineth honour to the stranger, more especially when the stranger is sick."" Then he carried him home and went in with him to his wife and bade her tend him. So she spread him a sleeping rug and set a cushion under his head, then warmed water for him and washed therewith his hands and feet and face. Meanwhile, the Stoker went to the market and bought some rose water and sugar, and sprinkled Zau al-Makan's face with the water and gave him to drink of the sherbet. Then he fetched a clean shirt and put it on him. With this, Zau al-Makan sniffed the zephyr of health and recovery returned to him; and he sat up and leant against the pillow. Hereat the Fireman rejoiced and exclaimed, ""Praise be to Allah for the welfare of this youth! O Allah, I beseech Thee by Thy knowledge of hidden things, that Thou make the salvation of this youth to be at my hands!""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Fifty-fourth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Fireman exclaimed, ""O Allah, I beseech Thee of Thy knowledge of hidden things, that Thou make this young man's life the work of my hands!"" And he ceased not to nurse him for three days, giving him to drink of sherbet of sugar and willow flower water and rose water; and doing him all manner of service and kindness, till health began to return to his body and Zau al-Makan opened his eyes. Presently came in the Fireman and, seeing him sitting up and showing signs of amendment, said to him, ""What is now thy state, O my son?"" ""Praise be to Allah,"" replied Zau al-Makan, ""I am well and like to recover, if such be the will of Allah Almighty at this time."" The Stoker praised the Lord of All for this and, wending fast to the market, bought ten chickens, which he carried to his wife and said, ""Kill two of these for him every day, one at dawn of day and the other at fall of day."" So she rose up and killed a fowl and brought it to him boiled, and fed him with the flesh and made him drink its broth. When he had done eating, she fetched hot water and he washed his hands and lay back upon the pillow, whereupon she covered him up with the coverlet, and he slept till the time of the mid afternoon prayer. Then she arose and killed another fowl and boiled it; after which she cut it up and, bringing it to Zau al-Makan, said, ""Eat, O my son!"" While he was eating; behold, her husband entered and seeing her feeding him, sat down at his head and said to him, ""How is it with thee now, O my son?"" ""Thanks be to Allah for recovery!"" he replied: ""may the Almighty requite thee thy kindness to me."" At this the Fireman rejoiced and going out, bought sherbet of violets and rose water and made him drink it. Now the Stoker used to work at the Hammam all day for a wage of five dirhams, whereof he spent every day, for Zau al-Makan, one dirham upon sugar and sherbet of rose water and willow flower water,[FN#236] and another dirham for fowls; and he ceased not to entreat him thus kindly during a whole month, till the traces of illness ceased from him and he was once more sound and whole. Thereupon the Fireman and his wife rejoiced and asked him, ""O my son, wilt thou go with me to the bath?""; whereto he answered, ""Yes!"" So the Stoker went to the bazar and fetched a donkey boy, and he mounted Zau al-Makan on the ass and supported him in the saddle till they came to the bath. Then he made him sit down and seated the donkey boy in the furnace-room and went forth to the market and bought Iote leaves and lupin-flour,[FN#237] with which he returned to the bath and said to Zau al-Makan, ""O my master, in Allah's name, walk in and I will wash thy body."" So they entered the inner room of the bath, and the Fireman took to rubbing Zau al-Makan's legs and began to wash his body with the leaves and meal, when there came to them a bathman, whom the bath keeper had sent to Zau al-Makan; and he, seeing the Stoker washing and rubbing him, said, ""This is doing injury to the keeper's rights."" Replied the Fireman, ""The master overwhelmeth us with his favours!"" Then the bathman proceeded to shave Zau al-Makan's head, after which he and the Stoker washed themselves and returned to the house, where he clad Zau al-Makan in a shirt of fine stuff and a robe of his own; and gave him a handsome turband and girdle and a light kerchief which he wound about his neck. Meanwhile the Fireman's wife had killed and cooked two chickens; so, as soon as Zau al-Makan entered and seated himself on the carpet, the husband arose and, dissolving sugar in willow flower water, made him drink of it. Then he brought the food tray and, cutting up the chickens, fed him with the flesh and gave him the broth to drink till he was satisfied; when he washed his hands and praised Allah for recovery, and said to the Fireman, ""Thou art he whom the Almighty vouchsafed to me and made the cause of my cure!"" ""Leave this talk,"" replied the other, ""and tell us the cause of thy coming to this city and whence thou art. Thy face showeth signs of gentle breeding."" ""Tell me first how thou camest to fall in with me,"" said Zau al-Makan; ""and after I will tell thee my story."" Rejoined the Fireman, ""As for that, I found thee lying on the rubbish heap by the door of the fire house, as I went to my work near the morning, and knew not who had thrown thee there. So I carried thee home with me; and this is all my tale."" Quoth Zau al-Makan, ""Glory to Him who quickeneth the bones, though they be rotten! Indeed, O my brother, thou hast not done good save to one worthy of it, and thou shalt presently gather its fruitage."" And he added, ""But where am I now?"" ""Thou art in the city of Jerusalem,"" replied the Stoker; where upon Zau al-Makan called to mind his strangerhood and remembered his separation from his sister and wept. Then he discovered his secret to the Fireman and told him his story and began repeating,

""In love they bore me further than my force would go, * And for
            them made me suffer resurrection throe:
Oh, have compassion, cruel! on this soul of mine * Which, since
            ye fared, is pitied by each envious foe;
Nor grudge the tender mercy of one passing glance * My case to
            lighten, easing this excess of woe:
Quoth I 'Heart, bear this loss in patience!' Patience cried *
             'Take heed! no patience in such plight I'm wont to show.' ""

Then he redoubled his weeping, and the Fireman said to him, ""Weep not, but rather praise Allah for safety and recovery."" Asked Zau al-Makan, ""How far is it hence to Damascus?"" Answered the other, ""Six days' journey."" Then quoth Zau al-Makan, ""Wilt thou send me thither?"" ""O my lord,"" quoth the Stoker, ""how can I allow thee to go alone, and thou a youth and a stranger to boot? If thou would journey to Damascus, I am one who will go with thee; and if my wife will listen to and obey me and accompany me, I will take up my abode there; for it is no light matter to part with thee."" Then said he to his wife, ""Wilt thou travel with me to Damascus of Syria or wilt thou abide here, whilst I lead this my lord thither and return to thee? For he is bent upon going to Damascus of Syria and, by Allah, it is hard to me to part with him, and I fear for him from highway men."" Replied she, ""I will go with you both;"" and he rejoined, ""Praised be Allah for accord, and we have said the last word!"" Then he rose and selling all his own goods and his wife's gear,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say,

When it was the Fifty-fifth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Fire man and his wife agreed with Zau al-Makan to travel with him Damascus wards. Then the Stoker sold his goods and his wife's gear and bought a camel and hired an ass for Zau al-Makan; and they set out, and ceased not wayfaring for six days till they reached Damascus. And they arrived there towards eventide; when the Fireman went forth and, as was his wont, bought some meat and drink. They had dwelt but five days in Damascus, when his wife sickened and, after a short illness, was translated to the mercy of Almighty Allah. Her death was a heavy matter to Zau al-Makan, for he was grown used to her as she had tended him assiduously; and the Fireman grieved for her with excessive grief. Presently the Prince turned to the Stoker and finding him mourning, said to him, ""Grieve not, for at this gate we must all go in."" Replied he, ""Allah make weal thy lot, O my son! Surely He will compensate us with His favours and cause our mourning to cease. What sayst thou, O my son, about our walking abroad to view Damascus and cheer thy spirits?"" Replied Zau al-Makan, ""Thy will is mine."" So the Fireman arose and placed his hand in that of Zau al- Makan and the two walked on till they came to the stables of the Viceroy of Damascus, where they found camels laden with chests and carpets and brocaded stuffs, and horses ready saddled and Bactrian dromedaries, while Mamelukes and negro slaves and folk in a hubbub were running to and fro. Quoth Zau al-Makan, ""I wonder to whom belong all these chattels and camels and stuffs!"" So he asked one of the eunuchs, ""Whither this dispatching?'' and he answered, ""These are presents sent by the Emir of Damascus to King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, with the tribute of Syria."" Now when Zau al-Makan heard his father's name his eyes brimmed over with tears, and he began repeating,

""Oh ye gone from the gaze of these ridded eyne, * Ye whose sight
             in my spirit shall ever dwell!
Your charms are gone, but this heart of me * Hath no sweet, and
             no pleasures its sour dispel;
If Allah's grace make us meet again, * In long drawn love-tale my
             love I'll tell.""

And when he had ended his verse, he wept and the Fireman said to him, ""O my son, we hardly believed that thy health had returned;[FN#238] so take heart and do not weep, for I fear a relapse for thee."" And he ceased not comforting and cheering him, whilst Zau al-Makan sighed and moaned over his strangerhood and separation from his sister and his family; and tears streamed from his eyes and he recited these couplets,

""Get thee provaunt in this world ere thou wend upon thy way, *
           And know how surely Death descends thy life lot to waylay:
All thy worldly goods are pride and the painfullest repine; * All
           thy worldly life is vexing, of thy soul in vain display:
Say is not worldly wone like a wanderer's place of rest, * Where
           at night he 'nakhs'[FN#239] his camels and moves off at dawn
           of day?""

And he continued to weep and wail over his separation; whilst the Fireman also bewept the loss of his wife, yet ceased not to comfort Zau al-Makan till morning dawned. When the sun rose, he said to him, ""Meseemeth thou yearnest for thy native land?"" ""Yes,"" replied Zau al-Makan, ""and I can no longer tarry here; so I will commend thee to Allah's care and set out with these folk and journey with them, little by little, till I come to my mother land."" Said the Stoker, ""And I with thee; for of a truth I cannot bear to part with thee. I have done thee kindly service and I mean to complete it by tending thee on thy travel."" At this, Zau al-Makan rejoiced and said, ""Allah abundantly requite thee for me!"" and was pleased with the idea of their travelling together. The Fireman at once went forth and bought another ass, selling the camel; and laid in his provaunt and said to Zau al-Makan, ""This is for thee to ride by the way; and, when thou art weary of riding, thou canst dismount and walk."" Said Zau al-Makan, ""May Allah bless thee and aid me to requite thee! for verily thou hast dealt with me more lovingly than one with his brother."" Then he waited till it was dark night, when he laid the provisions and baggage on that ass and set forth upon their journey. This much befel Zau al-Makan and the Fireman; but as regards what happened to his sister Nuzhat al-Zaman, when she left her brother in the Khan where they abode and, wrapped in the old camlet, went out to seek service with some one, that she might earn wherewithal to buy him the roast meat he longed for, she fared on, weeping and knowing not whither to go, whilst her mind was occupied with thoughts of her brother and of her family and her native land. So she implored Allah Almighty to do away with these calamities from them and began versifying,

""Dark falls the night and Passion comes sore pains to gar me
            dree, * And pine upstirs those ceaseless pangs which work my
           tormentry,
And cease not separation flames my vitals to consume, * And
           drives me on destruction way this sorrow's ecstacy
And longing breeds me restlessness; desire for ever fires, * And
          tears to all proclaim what I would keep in secrecy
No cunning shift is known to me a meeting to secure, * That I may
            quit this sickly state, may cure my malady:
The love which blazeth in my heart is fed with fancy fuel, * The
           lover from its hell of fire must bear Hell's agony![FN#240]
O thou who blamest me for all befel me, 'tis enough, * Patient I
           bear what ever wrote the Reed of Doom for me:
By Love I swear I'll never be consoled, no, never more; * I swear
             the oath of Love's own slaves who know no perjury:
O Night, to chroniclers of Love the news of me declare; * That
           sleep hath fed mine eyelids of thy knowledge witness bear!""

Then she walked on, weeping and turning right and left as she went, when behold, there espied her an old Badawi[FN#241] who had come into the town from the desert with wild Arabs other five. The old man took note of her and saw that she was lovely, but she had nothing on her head save a piece of camlet, and, marvelling at her beauty, he said to himself, ""This charmer dazzleth men's wits but she is in squalid condition, and whether she be of the people of this city or she be a stranger, I needs must have her."" So he followed her, little by little, till he met her face to face and stopped the way before her in a narrow lane, and called out to her, asking her case, and said, ""Tell me, O my little daughter! art thou a free woman or a slave?"" When she heard this, she said to him, ""By thy life, do not add to my sorrows!"" Quoth he, ""Allah hath blessed me with six daughters, of whom five died and only one is left me, the youngest of all; and I came to ask thee if thou be of the folk of this city or a stranger; that I might take thee and carry thee to her, to bear her company so as to divert her from pining for her sisters. If thou have no kith and kin, I will make thee as one of them and thou and she shall be as my two children."" Nuzhat al-Zaman bowed her head in bashfulness when she heard what he said and communed with herself, ""Haply I may trust myself to this old man."" Then she said to him, ""O nuncle, I am a maiden of the Arabs and a stranger and I have a sick brother; but I will go with thee to thy daughter on one condition, which is, that I may spend only the day with her and at night may return to my brother. If thou strike this bargain I will fare with thee, for I am a stranger and I was high in honour among my tribe, and I awoke one morning to find myself vile and abject. I came with my brother from the land of Al-Hijaz and I fearless he know not where I am."" When the Badawi heard this, he said to himself, ""By Allah, I have got my desire!"" Then he turned to her and replied, ""There shall none be dearer to me than thou; I wish thee only to bear my daughter company by day and thou shalt go to thy brother at earliest nightfall. Or, if thou wilt, bring him over to dwell with us."" And the Badawi ceased not to console her heart and coax her, till she trusted in him and agreed to serve him. Then he walked on before her and, when she followed him, he winked to his men to go in advance and harness the dromedaries and load them with their packs and place upon them water and provisions, ready for setting out as soon as he should come up with the camels. Now this Badawi was a base born churl, a highway thief and a traitor to the friend he held most fief, a rogue in grain, past master of plots and chicane. He had no daughter and no son and was only passing through the town when, by the decree of the Decreer, he fell in with this unhappy one. And he ceased not to hold her in converse on the highway till they came without the city of Jerusalem and, when outside, he joined his companions and found they had made ready the dromedaries. So the Badawi mounted a camel, having seated Nuzhat al-Zaman behind him and they rode on all night. Then she knew that the Badawi's proposal was a snare and that he had tricked her; and she continued weeping and crying out the whole night long, while they journeyed on making for the mountains, in fear any should see them. Now when it was near dawn, they dismounted from their dromedaries and the Badawi came up to Nuzhat al-Zaman and said to her, ""O city strumpet, what is this weeping? By Allah, an thou hold not thy peace, I will beat thee to death, O thou town filth!"" When she heard this she loathed life and longed for death; so she turned to him and said, ""O accursed old man, O gray beard of hell, how have I trusted thee and thou hast played me false, and now thou wouldst torture me?"" When he heard her reply he cried out, ""O lazy baggage, dost thou dare to bandy words with me?"" And he stood up to her and beat her with a whip, saying, ""An thou hold not thy peace, I will kill thee!"" So she was silent awhile, then she called to mind her brother and the happy estate she had been in and she shed tears secretly. Next day, she turned to the Badawi and said to him, ""How couldst thou play me this trick and lure me into these bald and stony mountains, and what is thy design with me?"" When he heard her words he hardened his heart and said to her, ""O lazy baggage of ill omen and insolent! wilt thou bandy words with me?"" and he took the whip and came down with it on her back till she felt faint. Then she bowed down over his feet and kissed[FN#242] them; and he left beating her and began reviling her and said, ""By the rights of my bonnet,[FN#243] if I see or hear thee weeping, I will cut out thy tongue and stuff it up thy coynte, O thou city filth!"" So she was silent and made him no reply, for the beating pained her; but sat down with her arms round her knees and, bowing her head upon her collar, began to look into her case and her abasement after her lot of high honour; and the beating she had endured; and she called to mind her brother and his sickness and forlorn condition, and how they were both strangers in a far country, which crave her tears down her cheeks and she wept silently and began repeating,

""Time hath for his wont to upraise and debase, * Nor is lasting
           condition for human race:
In this world each thing hath appointed turn; * Nor may man
            transgress his determined place:
How long these perils and woes? Ah woe * For a life, all woeful
            in parlous case!
Allah bless not the days which have laid me low * I' the world,
            with disgrace after so much grace!
My wish is baffled, my hopes cast down, * And distance forbids me
             to greet his face:
O thou who passeth that dear one's door, * Say for me, these
             tears shall flow evermore!""

When she had finished her verses, the Badawi came up to her and, taking compassion on her, bespoke her kindly and wiped away her tears. Then he gave her a barley scone and said, ""I love not one who answereth at times when I am in wrath: so henceforth give me no more of these impertinent words and I will sell thee to a good man like myself, who will do well with thee, even as I have done."" ""Yes; whatso thou doest is right,"" answered she; and when the night was longsome upon her and hunger burnt her, she ate very little of that barley bread. In the middle of the night the Badawi gave orders for departure,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Fifty-sixth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Badawi gave the barley scone to Nuzhat al-Zaman and promised he would sell her to a good man like himself, she replied, ""Whatso thou doest is right!"" and, about midnight when hunger burned her,[FN#244] she ate a very little of that barley bread and the Badawi ordered his party to set out; so they loaded their loads and he mounted a camel setting Nuzhat al-Zaman behind him. Then they journeyed and ceased not journeying for three days, till they entered the city of Damascus and alighted at the Sultan's Khan, hard by the Viceroy's Gate. Now she had lost her colour by grief and the fatigue of such travelling, and she ceased not to weep over her misfortunes. So the Badawi came up to her and said, ""O thou city filth, by the right of my bonnet, if thou leave not this weeping, I will sell thee to none but a Jew!"" Then he arose and took her by the hand and carried her to a chamber, and walked off to the bazar, and he went round to, the merchants who dealt in slave girls, and began to parley with them, saying, ""I have brought a slave girl whose brother fell ill, and I sent him to my people about Jerusalem, that they might tend him till he is cured. As for her I want to sell her, but after the dog her brother fell sick, the separation from him was grievous to her, and since then she doth nothing but weep, and now I wish that whoso is minded to buy her of me speak softly to her and say, 'Thy brother is with me in Jerusalem ill'; and I will be easy with him about her price."" Then one of the merchants came up to him and asked, ""How old is she?"" He answered ""She is a virgin, just come to marriageable age, and she is endowed with sense and breeding and wit and beauty and loveliness. But from the day I sent her brother to Jerusalem, her heart hath been yearning for him, so that her beauty is fallen away and her value lessened."" Now when the merchant heard this, he set forth with the Badawi and said, ""O Shaykh[FN#245] of the Arabs, I will go with thee and buy of thee this girl whom thou praisest so highly for wit and manners and beauty and loveliness; and I will pay thee her price but it must be upon conditions which if thou accept, I will give thee ready money, and if thou accept not I will return her to thee."" Quoth the Badawi, ""An thou wilt, take her up to the Sultan Sharrkan, son of Omar bin al-Nu'uman lord of Baghdad and of the land of Khorasan, and condition me any conditions thou likest, for when thou hast brought her before King Sharrkan, haply she will please him, and he will pay thee her price and a good profit for thyself to boot."" Rejoined the merchant, ""It happens that I have just now something to ask from him, and it is this that he write me an order upon the office, exempting me from custom dues and also that he write me a letter of recommendation to his father, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman. So if he take the girl, I will weigh[FN#246] thee out her price at once."" ""I agree with thee to this condition,"" answered the Badawi. So they returned together to the place where Nuzhat al-Zaman was and the wild Arab stood at the chamber door and called out, saying, ""O Nájiyah[FN#247]!"" which was the name wherewith he had named her. When she heard him, she wept and made no answer. Then he turned to the merchant and said to him, ""There she sitteth; go to her and look at her and speak to her kindly as I enjoined thee."" So the trader went up to her in courteous wise and saw that she was wondrous beautiful and loveable, especially as she knew the Arabic tongue; and he said to the Badawi, ""If she be even as thou saddest, I shall get of the Sultan what I will for her."" Then he bespake her, ""Peace be on thee, my little maid! How art thou?"" She turned to him and replied, ""This also was registered in the Book of Destiny."" Then she looked at him and, seeing him to be a man of respectable semblance with a handsome face, she said to herself, ""I believe this one cometh to buy me;"" and she continued, ""If I hold aloof from him, I shall abide with my tyrant and he will do me to death with beating. In any case, this person is handsome of face and maketh me hope for better treatment from him than from my brute of a Badawi. May be he cometh only to hear me talk; so I will give him a fair answer."" All this while her eyes were fixed on the ground; then she raised them to him and said in a sweet voice, ""And upon thee be peace, O my lord, and Allah's mercy and His benediction![FN#248] This is what is commanded of the Prophet, whom Allah bless and preserve! As for thine enquiry how I am, if thou wouldst know my case, it is such as thou wouldst not wish but to thy foe."" And she held her peace. When the merchant heard what she said, his fancy took wings for delight in her and, turning to the Badawi, he asked him, ""What is her price, for indeed she is noble?"" Thereupon the Badawi waxed angry and answered, ""Thou wilt turn me the girl's head with this talk! Why dost thou say that she is noble,[FN#249] while she is of the scum of slave girls and of the refuse of folk? I will not sell her to thee!"" When the merchant heard this, he knew the man to be weak of wits and said to him, ""Calm thyself, for I will buy her of thee with these blemishes thou mentionest."" ""And how much wilt thou give me for her?"" enquired the Badawi. Replied the merchant, ""Name thy price for her: none should name the son save his sire."" Rejoined the Badawi, ""None shall name it but thou thyself."" Quoth the merchant to himself, ""This wildling is a rudesby and a maggotty head. By Allah, I cannot tell her price, for she hath won my heart with her fair speech and good looks; and, if she can read and write, it will be complete fair luck to her and to her purchaser. But this Badawi does not know her worth."" Then he turned and said to him, ""O Shaykh of the Arabs, I will give thee in ready money, clear of the tax and the Sultan's dues, two hundred gold pieces."" Now when the Badawi heard this, he flew into a violent rage and cried at the merchant, saying, ""Get up and go thy ways! By Allah, wert thou to offer me two hundred diners for the bit of camlet she weareth, I would not sell it to thee. And now I will not sell her, but will keep her by me, to pasture the camels and grind my grist."" And he cried out to her, saying, ""Come here, thou stinkard! I will not sell thee."" Then he turned to the merchant and said to him, ""I used to think thee a man of judgment; but, by the right of my bonnet, if thou begone not from me, I will let thee hear what shall not please thee!"" Quoth the merchant to himself, ""Of a truth this Badawi is mad and knoweth not her value, and I will say no more to him about her price at the present time; for by Allah, were he a man of sense, he would not say, 'By the rights of my bonnet!' By the Almighty, she is worth the kingdom of the Chosroës and I have not her price by me, but if he ask even more, I will give him what he will, though it be all my goods."" Then he turned and said to him, ""O Shaykh of the Arabs, take patience and calm thyself and tell me what clothes she hath with thee?"" Cried the Badawi, ""And what hath the baggage to do with clothes? By Allah, this camlet in which she is wrapped is ample for her."" ""With thy leave,"" said the merchant, ""I will unveil her face and examine her even as folk examine slave girls whom they think of buying.""[FN#250] Replied the other, ""Up and do what thou wilt and Allah keep thy youth! Examine her outside and inside and, if thou wilt, strip off her clothes and look at her when she is naked."" Quoth the trader, ""Allah forfend! I will look at naught save her face.""[FN#251] Then he went up to her and was put to shame by her beauty and loveliness,—And Shahrazed perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Fifty-seventh Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the merchant went up to Nuzhat al-Zaman and was put to shame by her beauty and loveliness, so he sat by her side and asked her, ""O my mistress, what is thy name?"" She answered, ""Doss thou ask what is my name this day or what it was before this day?"" Thereupon the merchant enquired, ""Hast thou then two names: to day's and yesterday's?"" ""Yes,"" replied she, ""my name in the past was Nuzhat al-Zaman, the Delight of the Age; but my name at this present is Ghussat[FN#252] al-Zaman, the Despight of the Age."" When the merchant heard this his eyes brimmed over with tears and quoth he to her, ""Hast thou not a sick brother?"" ""Ay by Allah, O my lord, I have,"" quoth she, ""but fortune hath parted me and him and he lieth sick in Jerusalem."" The merchant's head was confounded at the sweetness of her speech and he said to himself, ""Verily, the Badawi spake the truth of her."" Then she called to mind her brother and his sickness and his strangerhood and her separation from him in his hour of weakness and her not knowing what had befallen him; and she thought of all that had happened to her with the Badawi and of her severance from her mother and father and native land; and the tears coursed down her cheeks and fast as they started they dropped; and she began reciting,

""Allah, where'er thou be, His aid impart * To thee, who distant
             dwellest in my heart!
Allah be near thee how so far thou fare; * Ward off all shifts of
            Time, all dangers thwart!
Mine eyes are desolate for thy vanisht sight, * And start my
            tears-ah me, how fast they start!
Would Heaven I kenned what quarter or what land * Homes thee, and
           in what house and tribe thou art
A fount of life thou drain in greenth of rose, * While drink I
             tear drops for my sole desert?
An thou 'joy slumber in those hours, when I * Peel 'twixt my side
           and couch coals' burning smart?
All things were easy save to part from thee, * For my sad heart
           this grief is hard to dree.""

When the merchant heard her verses, he wept and put out his hand to wipe away the tears from her cheeks; but she let down her veil over her face, saying, ""Heaven forbid, O my lord!''[FN#253] Then the Badawi, who was sitting at a little distance watching them, saw her cover her face from the merchant while about to wipe the tears from her cheeks; and he concluded that she would have hindered him from handling her: so he rose and running to her, dealt her, with a camel's halter he had in his hand, such a blow on the shoulders that she fell to the ground on her face. Her eyebrow struck a stone which cut it open, and the blood streamed down her cheeks; whereupon she screamed a loud scream and felt faint and wept bitterly. The merchant was moved to tears for her and said in himself, ""There is no help for it but that I buy this damsel, though at her weight in gold, and free her from this tyrant."" And he began to revile the Badawi whilst Nazhat al- Zaman lay in sensible. When she came to herself, she wiped away the tears and blood from her face; and she bound up her head: then, raising her glance to heaven, she besought her Lord with a sorrowful heart and began repeating,

""And pity one who erst in honour throve, * And now is fallen into
             sore disgrace.
She weeps and bathes her cheeks with railing tears, * And asks
            'What cure can meet this fatal case?'""

When she had ended her verse, she turned to the merchant and said in an undertone, ""By the Almighty, do not leave me with a tyrant who knoweth not Allah the Most High! If I pass this night in his place, I shall kill myself with my own hand: save me from him, so Allah save thee from Gehenna-fire."" Then quoth the merchant to the Badawi, ""O Shaykh of the Arabs, this slave is none of thine affair; so do thou sell her to me for what thou wilt."" ""Take her,"" quoth the Badawi, ""and pay me down her price, or I will carry her back to the camp and there set her to feed the camels and gather their dung.""[FN#254] Said the merchant, ""I will give thee fifty thousand diners for her."" ""Allah will open!""[FN#255] replied the Badawi. ""Seventy thousand,"" said the merchant. ""Allah will open!"" repeated the Badawi: ""this is not the capital spent upon her, for she hath eaten with me barley bread to the value of ninety thousand gold pieces."" The merchant rejoined, ""Thou and thine and all thy tribe in the length of your lives have not eaten a thousand ducats' worth of barley; but I will say thee one word, wherewith if thou be not satisfied, I will set the Viceroy of Damascus on thee and he will take her from thee by force."" The Badawi continued, ""Say on!"" ""An hundred thousand,"" quoth the merchant. ""I have sold her to thee at that price,"" answered the Badawi; ""I shall be able to buy salt with her."" The merchant laughed and, going to his lodgings, brought the money and put it into the hand of the Badawi, who took it and made off, saying to himself, ""Needs must I go to Jerusalem where, haply, I shall happen on her brother, and I will bring him here and sell him also."" So he mounted and journeyed till he arrived at Jerusalem, where he went to the Khan and asked for Zau al-Makan, but could not find him. Such was the case with him; but for what regards the merchant and Nazhat al-Zaman, when he took her he threw some of his clothes over her and carried her to his lodgings,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Fifty-eighth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the trader saved Nuzhat al-Zaman from the Badawi and bore her to his lodgings and robed her in the richest raiment, he went down with her to the bazar, where he bought her what ornaments she chose and put them in a satin bag, which he set before her, saying, ""All is for thee and I ask nothing of thee in return but that, when I lead thee to the Sultan, Viceroy of Damascus, thou acquaint him with the price I paid for thee, albeit it was little compared with thy value: and, if seeing thee he buy thee of me, thou tell him how I have dealt with thee and ask of him for me a royal patent, and a written recommendation wherewith I can repair to his father, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, Lord of Baghdad, to the intent that he may forbid the tax on my stuffs or any other goods in which I traffic."" When she heard his words, she wept and sobbed, and the merchant said to her, ""O my lady, I observe that, every time I mention Baghdad, thine eyes are tearful: is there any one there whom thou lovest? If it be a trader or the like, tell me; for I know all the merchants and so forth there and, if thou wouldst send him a message, I will bear it for thee."" Replied she, ""By Allah, I have no acquaintance among merchant folk and the like! I know none there but King Omar bin Nu'uman, Lord of Baghdad."" When the merchant heard her words, he laughed and rejoiced with exceeding joy and said in himself, ""By Allah, I have won my wish!"" Then he said to her, ""Hast thou been shown to him in time past?"" She answered, ""No, but I was brought up with his daughter and he holdeth me dear and I have high honour with him; so if thou wouldst have the King grant thee thy desire, give me ink case and paper and I will write thee a letter; and when thou reachest the city of Baghdad, do thou deliver it into the hand of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman and say to him, 'Thy handmaid, Nuzhat al-Zaman, would have thee to know that the chances and changes of the nights and days have struck her as with a hammer, and have smitten her so that she hath been sold from place to place, and she sendeth thee her salams.' And, if he ask further of her, say that I am now with the Viceroy at Damascus."" The merchant wondered at her eloquence, and his affection for her increased and he said to her I cannot but think that men have played upon thine understanding and sold thee for money. Tell me, dost thou know the Koran by heart?"" ""Yes,"" answered she; ""and I am also acquainted with philosophy and medicine and the prolegomena of science and the commentaries of Galen, the physician, on the canons of Hippocrates; and I have commented him and I have read the Tazkirah and have commented the Burhán; and I have studied the Simples of Ibn Baytár, and I have something to say of the canon of Meccah, by Avicenna. I can ree riddles and can solve ambiguities, and discourse upon geometry and am skilled in anatomy I have read the books of the Sháfi'í[FN#256] school and the Traditions of the Prophet and syntax; and I can argue with the Olema and discourse of all manner learning. Moreover I am skilled in logic and rhetoric and arithmetic and the making of talismans and almanacs, and I know thoroughly the Spiritual Sciences[FN#257] and the times appointed for religious duties and I understand all these branches of knowledge."" Then quoth she to the merchant, ""Bring me ink case and paper, that I write thee a letter which shall aid thee on thy journey to Baghdad and enable thee to do without passports."" Now when the merchant heard this, he cried out ""Brava! Brava![FN#258] Then O happy he in whose palace thou shalt! Thereupon he brought her paper and ink case and a pen of brass and bussed the earth before her face to do her honour. She took a sheet and handled the reed and wrote therewith these verses,

""I see all power of sleep from eyes of me hath flown; * Say, did
           thy parting teach these eyne on wake to wone?
What makes thy memory light such burnings in my heart? * Hath
            every lover strength such memories to own?
How sweet the big dropped cloud which rained on summer day; *
            'Tis gone and ere I taste its sweets afar 'tis flown:
I pray the wind with windy breath to bring some news * From thee,
            to lover wightwi' love so woe begone
Complains to thee a lover of all hope forlorn, * For parting
             pangs can break not only heart but stone.""

And when she had ended writing the verses she continued, ""These words are from her who saith that melancholy destroyeth her and that watching wasteth her; in the murk of whose night is found no light and darkness and day are the same in her sight. She tosseth on the couch of separation and her eyes are blackened with the pencils of sleeplessness; she watcheth the stars arise and into the gloom she strains her eyes: verily, sadness and leanness have consumed her strength and the setting forth of her case would run to length. No helper hath she but tears and she reciteth these verses,

'No ring dove moans from home on branch in morning light, * But
             shakes my very frame with sorrow's killing might:
No lover sigheth for his love or gladdeth heart * To meet his
             mate, but breeds in me redoubled blight
I bear my plaint to one who has no ruth for me, * Ah me, how Love
             can part man's mortal frame and sprite!' ""
Then her eyes welled over with tears, and she wrote also these two couplets,

""Love smote my frame so sore on parting day, * That severance
             severed sleep and eyes for aye.
I waxt so lean that I am still a man, * But for my speaking, thou
             wouldst never say.""

Then she shed tears and wrote at the foot of the sheet, ""This cometh from her who is far from her folk and her native land, the sorrowful hearted woman Nuzhat al-Zaman."" In fine, she folded the sheet and gave it to the merchant, who took it and kissed it and understood its contents and exclaimed, ""Glory to Him who fashioned thee!""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Fifty-ninth Night,

She said, It reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al-Zaman wrote the letter and gave it to the merchant; and he took it and read it and understood the contents and exclaimed, ""Glory to Him who fashioned thee!"" Then he redoubled his kindness and made himself pleasant to her all that day, and when night came he sallied out to the bazar and bought some food, wherewith he fed her; after which he carried her to the Hammam and said to the bath woman, ""As soon as thou hast made an end of washing her head, dress her and send and let me know of it."" And she replied ""Hearing is obeying."" Meanwhile he fetched food and fruit and wax candles and set them on the bench in the outer room of the bath; and when the tire woman had done washing her, she dressed her and led her out of the bath and seated her on the bench. Then she sent to tell the merchant, and Nuzhat al-Zaman went forth to the outer room, where she found the tray spread with food and fruit. So she ate and the tire woman with her, and gave the rest to the people and keeper of the bath. Then she slept till the morning, and the merchant lay the night in a place apart from her. When he aroused himself from sleep he came to her and waking her, presented her with a shift of fine stuff and a head kerchief worth a thousand diners, a suit of Turkish embroidery and walking boots purfled with red gold and set with pearls and gems. Moreover, he hung in each of her ears a circlet of gold with a fine pearl therein, worth a thousand diners, and threw round her neck a collar of gold with bosses of garnet and a chain of amber beads that hung down between her breasts over her navel. Now to this chain were attached ten balls and nine crescents, and each crescent had in its midst a bezel of ruby, and each ball a bezel of balass: the value of the chain was three thousand diners and each of the balls was priced at twenty thousand dirhams, so that the dress she wore was worth in all a great sum of money. When she had put these on, the merchant bade her adorn herself, and she adorned herself to the utmost beauty; then she let fall her fillet over her eyes and she fared forth with the merchant preceding her. But when folk saw her, all wondered at her beauty and exclaimed, ""Blessed be Allah, the most excellent Creator! O lucky the man in whose house the hall be!"" And the trader ceased not walking (and she behind him) till they entered the palace of Sultan Sharrkan; when he sought an audience and, kissing the earth between his hands, said, ""O auspicious King, I have brought thee a rare gift, unmatched in this time and richly gifted with beauty and with good qualities."" Quoth the King, ""Let me see it."" So the merchant went out and brought her, she following him till he made her stand before King Sharrkan. When he beheld her, blood yearned to blood, though she had been parted from him in childhood and though he had never seen her, having only heard a long time after her birth that he had a sister called Nuzhat al- Zaman and a brother Zau al-Makan, he having been jealous of them, because of the succession. And such was the cause of his knowing little about them. Then, having placed her before the presence, the merchant said, ""O King of the age, besides being peerless in her time and beauty and loveliness, she is also versed in all learning, sacred and profane, including the art of government and the abstract sciences."" Quoth the King to the trader, ""Take her price, according as thou boughtest her, and go thy ways."" ""I hear and I obey,"" replied the merchant; ""but first write me a patent, exempting me for ever from paying tithe on my merchandise."" Said the King, ""I will do this, but first tell me what price thou paidest for her."" Said the merchant, ""I bought her for an hundred thousand diners, and her clothes cost me another hundred thousand."" When the Sultan heard these words, he declared, ""I will give thee a higher price than this for her;"" and, calling his treasurer, said to him, ""Pay this merchant three hundred and twenty thousand ducats; so will he have an hundred and twenty thousand diners profit."" Thereupon the Sultan summoned the four Kazis and paid him the money in their presence and then he said, ""I call you to witness that I free this my slave girl and purpose to marry her."" So the Kazis wrote out the deed of emancipation and the contract of marriage, when the Sultan scattered much gold on the heads of those present; and the pages and the eunuchs picked up this largesse. Then, after paying him his monies, Sharrkan bade them write for the merchant a perpetual patent, exempting him from toll, tax or tithe upon his merchandise and forbidding each and every in all his government to molest him, and lastly bestowed on him a splendid dress of honour.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Sixtieth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Sharrkan bade them write for the merchant a mandate, after paying him his monies; and they wrote a perpetual patent, exempting him from the tithe upon his merchandise and forbidding any in his government to molest him; and lastly bestowed upon him a splendid dress of honour. Then all about him retired, and none remained save the Kazis and the merchant, whereupon said he to the judges, ""I wish you to hear such discourse from this damsel as may prove her knowledge and accomplishments in all aimed for her by this trader, that we ascertain the truth of his assertions."" They answered, ""There is no evil in that!""; and he commanded the curtain to be let down between him and those with him and the maiden and those with her; and the women about the damsel behind the curtains began to wish her joy and kiss her hands and feet, when they learned that she was become the King's wife. Then they came round her and took off her dresses easing her of the weight of her clothes and began to look upon her beauty and loveliness. Presently the wives of the Emirs and Wazirs heard that King Sharrkan had bought a hand maiden unmatched for her beauty and learning and philosophy and account keeping, and versed in all branches of knowledge, that he had paid for her three hundred and twenty thousand dinars, and that he had set her free and had written a marriage contract with her and had summoned the four Kazis to make trial of her, how she would answer all their questions and hold disputetion with them. So they asked leave of their husbands and repaired to the palace wherein was Nuzhat al- Zaman. When they came in to her, they found the eunuchs standing before her; and, as soon as she saw the wives of the Emirs and Wazirs and Grandees of the realm coming to call upon her, she arose to them on her feet and met them with courtesy, her handmaidens standing behind her, and she received them saying, ""Ye be welcome!"" The while she smiled in their faces so as to win their hearts; and she promised them all manner of good and seated them in their proper stations, as if she had been brought up with them; so all wondered at her beauty and loveliness and said to one another, ""This damsel is none other than a Queen, the daughter of a King."" Then they sat down, magnifying her worth and said to her, ""O our lady, this our city is illumined by thee, and our country and abode and birth place and reign are honoured by thy presence. The kingdom indeed is thy kingdom and the palace is thy palace, and we all are thy handmaids; so, by Allah, do not shut us out from thy favours and the sight of thy beauty."" And she thanked them for this. All this while the curtains were let down between Nuzhat al-Zaman and the women with her, on the one side, and King Sharrkan and the four Kazis and the merchant seated by him on the other. Presently King Sharrkan called to her and said, ""O Queen, the glory of thine age, this merchant hath described thee as being learned and accomplished; and he claimeth that thou art skilled in all branches of knowledge, even to astrology: so let us hear something of all this he hath mentioned, and favour us with a short discourse on such subjects."" She replied, saying: ""O King, to hear is to obey.[FN#259] The first subjects whereof I will treat are the art of government and the duties of Kings and what behoveth governors of command meets according to religious law, and what is incumbent on them in respect of satisfactory speech and manners. Know then, O King, that all men's works tend either to religious or to laical life, for none attaineth to religion save through this world, because it is the best road to futurity. Now the works of this world are not ordered save by the doings of its people, and men's doings are divided into four divisions, government, commerce, husbandry and craftsmanship. Now government requireth perfect administration with just and true judgment; for government is the pivot of the edifice of the world, which world is the road to futurity; since Allah Almighty hath made the world for His servants as viaticum to the traveller for the attainment of his goal; and it befitteth each man that he receive of it such measure as shall bring him to Allah, and that he follow not herein his own mind and his individual lust. If folk would take of worldly goods with justice and equity, all cause of contention would be cut off; but they take thereof with violence ant after their own desires, and their persistence therein giveth rise to contentions; so they have need of the Sultan, that he do justice between them and order their affairs; and, if the King restrain not his folk from one another, the strong will drive the weak to the wall. Hence Ardeshir[FN#260] saith, 'Religion and Kingship be twins'; religion is a hidden treasure and the King is its keeper; and the Divine Ordinances and men's intelligence point out that it behoveth the people to adopt a Sultan who shall withhold oppressor from oppressed and do the weak justice against the strong and restrain the violence of the proud and the rebels against rule. For know, O King, that according to the measure of the Sultan's good morals, even so will be the time; as saith the Apostle of Allah (on whom be peace and salvation!), 'There be two classes who, if they be good, the people will be good; and if they be bad, the people will be bad, even the Olema and the Emirs.' And it is said by a certain sage, 'There be three kinds of Kings, the King of the Faith, the King who protecteth things to which reverence is due, and the King of his own lusts.' The King of the Faith obligeth his subjects to follow their faith, and it behoveth he be the most faithful,[FN#261] for it is by him that they take pattern in the things of the Faith; and it becometh the folk to obey him in whatso he commandeth according to Divine Ordinance; but he shall hold the discontented in the same esteem as the contented, because of submission to the decrees of Destiny. As for the King who protecteth things to be reverenced, he upholdeth the things of the Faith and of the World and compelleth his folk to follow the Divine Law and to preserve the rights of humanity; and it fitteth him to unite Pen and Sword; for whoso declineth from what Pen hath written his feet slip and the King shall rectify his error with the sharp Sword and dispread his justice over all mankind. As for the King of his own lusts, he hath no religion but the following his desire and, as he feareth not the wrath of his Lord who set him on the throne, so his Kingdom inclineth to deposition and the end of his pride is in the house of perdition. And sages say, 'The King hath need of many people, but the people have need of but one King' wherefore it beseemeth that he be well acquainted with their natures, that he reduce their discord to concord, that with his justice be encompass them all and with his bounties overwhelm them all. And know, O King, that Ardeshir, styled Jamr Shadíd, or the Live Coal, third of the Kings of Persia, conquered the whole world and divided it into four divisions and, for this purpose, get for himself four seal rings, one for each division. The first seal was that of the sea and the police of prohibition and on it was written, Alterna lives. The second was the seal of tribute and of the receipt of monies, and on it was written, Building up. The third was the seal of the provisioning department and on it was written, Plenty. The fourth was the seal of the oppressed, and on it was written, Justice. And these usages remained valid in Persia until the revelation of Al-Islam. Chosroës also wrote his son, who was with the army, 'Be not thou too open handed with thy troops, or they will be too rich to need thee.'—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Sixty-first night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Chosroës wrote his son, 'Be not thou too open handed with thy troops, or they will be too rich to need thee; nor be thou niggardly with them, or they will murmur against thee. Give thy giving deliberately and confer thy favours advisedly; open thy hand to them in time of success and stint them not in time of distress.' There is a legend that a desert Arab came once to the Caliph Al- Mansúr[FN#262] and said, 'Starve thy dog and he shall follow thee.' When the Caliph heard his words, he was enraged with the Arab, but Abu 'l-Abbás of Tús said to him, 'I fear that if some other than thou should show him a scone, the dog would follow him and leave thee alone.' Thereupon the Caliph Al-Mansur's wrath subsided and he knew that the wild Arab had intended no offence and ordered him a present. And know, O King, that Abd al-Malik bin Marwán wrote to his brother Abd al-Azíz, when he despatched him to Egypt, as follows, 'Pay heed to thy Secretaries and thy Chamberlains, for the Secretaries will acquaint thee with estate fished matters and the Chamberlains with matters of official ceremony, whilst thine expenditure will make thy troops known to thee.' Omar bin Al-Khattáb[FN#263] (whom Allah accept!) when engaging a servant was in the habit of conditioning him with four conditions; the first that he should not ride the baggage beasts, the second that he should not wear fine clothes, the third that he should not eat of the spoil and the fourth that he should not put off praying till after the proper period. It is said that there is no wealth more profitable than understanding, and there is no understanding like common sense and prudence, and there is no prudence like piety; that there is no means of drawing near to God like good morals, no measure like good breeding, no traffic like good works and no profit like earning the Divine favour; that there is no temperance like standing within the limits of the law, no science like that of meditation, no worship like obeying the Divine commends, no faith like modesty, no calculation like self abasement and no honour like knowledge. So guard the head and what it containeth and the belly and what it compriseth; and think of death and doom ere it ariseth. Saith Ali (whose face Allah honour!), 'Beware of the wickedness of women and be on thy guard against them: consult them not in aught;[FN#264] but grudge not complaisance to them, lest they greed for intrigue.' And eke quoth he, 'Whoso leaveth the path of moderation his wits become perplexed'; and there be rules for this which we will mention, if it be Allah's will. And Omar (whom Allah accept!) saith, 'There are three kinds of women, firstly the true believing, Heaven fearing, love full and fruit full, who helpeth her mate against fate, not helping fate against her mate; secondly, she who loveth her children but no more and, lastly, she who is a shackle Allah setteth on the neck of whom He will.' Men be also three: the wise when he exerciseth his own judgement; the wiser who, when befalleth somewhat whereof he knoweth not the issue, seeketh folk of good counsel and acteth by their advice; and the unwise irresolute ignoring the right way nor heeding those who would guide him straight. Justice is indispensable in all things; even slave girls have need of justice; and men quote as an instance highway robbers who live by violenting mankind, for did they not deal equitably among themselves and observe justice in dividing their booty, their order would fall to pieces.[FN#265] In short, for the rest, the Prince of noble qualities is Beneficence cum Benevolence; and how excellent is the saying of the poet,

By open hand and ruth the youth rose to his tribe's command; * Go and do likewise for the same were easy task to thee.'

And quoth another,

'In ruth and mildness surety lies and mercy wins respect, * And
             Truth is best asylum for the man of soothfast soul:
Whoso for wealth of gold would win and wear the world's good
             word, * On glory's course must ever be the first to gain the
             goal.'""

And Nazhat al-Zaman discoursed upon the policy of Kings till the bystanders said, ""Never have we seen one reason of rule and government like this damsel! Haply she will let us hear some discourse upon subject other than this."" When she heard their words and understood them she said, ""As for the chapter of good breeding, it is wide of comprehension, being a compend of things perfect. Now it so happened that one day there came to the Caliph Mu'áwiyah[FN#266] one of his companions, who mentioned the people of Irak and the goodness of their wit; and the Caliph's wife Maysún, mother of Yezíd, heard his words. So, when he was gone, she said to the Caliph, 'O Prince of the Faithful, I would thou let some of the people of Irak come in and talk to thee, that I may hear their discourse.' Therewith Mu'awiyah said to his attendants, 'See who is at the door?' And they answered, 'The Banu Tamim.' 'Let them come in,' said he. So they came in and with them Al-Ahnáf son of Kays.[FN#267] Then quoth Mu'awiyah, 'Enter, O Abu Bahr,' and drew a curtain between himself and Maysun, that she might hear what they said without being seen herself; then he said to Al-Ahnaf, 'O Son of the Sea, draw near and tell me what counsel thou hast for me.' Quoth Al-Ahnaf, 'Part thy hair and trim thy moustachio and pare thy nails and pluck thine armpits and shave thy pubes[FN#268] and ever use the toothstick because therein be two and seventy virtues, and make the Ghusl or complete ablution on Friday, as an expiation for all between the Fridays.'—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Sixty-second Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Ahnaf bin Kays replied to Al-Mu'awiyah's[FN#269] question, 'And ever use the toothstick, because therein be two end seventy virtues and make the complete Friday ablution as an expiation for all between the two Fridays.' Quoth Mu'awiyah, 'What is thy counsel to thyself?' 'To set my feet firmly on the ground, to move them deliberately and watch over them with mine eyes!' 'How dost thou order thyself when thou goest in to one not of the nobles of thy tribe?' 'I lower mine eyes modestly and I salute first; I avoid what concerneth me not and I spare my words!' 'And how when thou goest in to thine equals?' 'I give ear to them when they speak and I do not assail them when they err!' 'When thou goest in to thy chiefs?' 'I salute without making any sign and await the reply: if they bid me draw near, I draw near, and if they draw off from me I withdraw!' 'How dost thou with thy wife?' Quoth Ahnaf, 'Excuse me from answering this, O Commander of the Faithful!'; but Mu'awiyah cried, 'I conjure thee inform me.' He said, 'I entreat her kindly and show her familiarity and am large in expenditure, for woman was created of a crooked rib.'[FN#270] 'And how dost thou when thou hast a mind to lie with her?' 'I bid her perfume herself and kiss her till she is moved to desire; then, should it be as thou knowest,[FN#271] I throw her on her back. If the seed abide in her womb I say, 'O Allah make it blessed and let it not be a wastrel, but fashion it into the best of fashions!'[FN#272] Then I rise from her to ablution and first I pour water over my hands and then over my body and lastly, I praise Allah for the joy He hath given me.' Said Mu'awiyah, 'Thou hast answered right well and now tell me what be thy requirements?' Said Ahnaf, 'I would have thee rule thy subjects in the fear of Allah and do even handed justice between them.' Thereupon Ahnaf rose to his feet and left the Caliph's presence, and when he had gone Maysun said, 'Were there but this man in Irak, he would suffice to it.' Then continued Nuzhat al-Zaman, ""And all this is a section of the chapter of good breeding, and know O King, that Muaykib was intendant of the public treasury during the Caliphate of Omar bin al-Khattáb,""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Sixty-third Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman continued, ""Know, O King, that Mu'aykib was intendant of the public treasury during the Caliphate of Omar bin al-Khattab; and it so befel him that he saw Omar's son and gave him a dirham out of the treasury. Thereupon, quoth Mu'aykib, 'I returned to my own house, and while I was sitting there behold, a messenger came to me from Omar and I was afraid and went to him, and when I came into his presence, in his hand was the dirham I had given his son. He said to me, 'Woe to thee Mu'aykib! I have found somewhat concerning thy soul.' I asked 'And what is that?'; and he answered, 'It is that thou hast shown thyself a foe to the followers of Mohammed (on whom be peace and salvation!) in the matter of this dirham, and thou wilt have to account for it on Resurrection Day.'[FN#273] And Omar also wrote a letter to Abú Músá al-Ashári[FN#274] as follows, 'When these presents reach thee, give the people what is theirs and remit to me the rest.' And he did so. Now when Othman succeeded to the Caliphate, he wrote a like letter to Abu Musa, who did his bidding and sent him the tribute accordingly, and with it came Ziyád.[FN#275] And when Ziyad laid the tribute before Othman, the Caliph's son came in and took a dirham, whereupon Ziyad shed tears. Othman asked 'Why weepest thou?'; and Ziyad answered, 'I once brought Omar bin al-Khattab the like of this and his son took a dirham, where upon Omar bade snatch it from his hand. Now thy son hath taken of the tribute, yet I have seen none say aught to him or snatch the money from him.' Then Othman[FN#276] cried, 'And where wilt thou find the like of Omar?' Again Zayd bin Aslam relates of his father that he said, 'I went out one night with Omar till we approached a blazing fire. Quoth Omar, 'O Aslam, I think these must be travellers who are suffering from the cold. Come, let us join them.' So we walked on till we came to them and behold! we found a woman who had lighted a fire under a cauldron and by her side were two children, both a wailing. Said Omar, 'Peace be with you, O folk of light (for it was repugnant to him to say 'folk of fire'),[FN#277] what aileth you?' Said she, 'The cold and the night trouble us.' He asked, 'What aileth these little people that they weep?'; and she answered, 'They are hungry.' He enquired, 'And what is in this cauldron?'; and she replied, 'It is what I quiet them withal, and Allah will question Omar bin al- Khattab of them, on the Day of Doom.' He said, 'And what should Omar know of their case?' 'Why then,' rejoined she, 'should he manage people's affairs and yet be unmindful of them?' Thereupon Omar turned to me (continned Aslam) and cried, 'Come with us!' So we set off running till we reached the pay department of his treasury, where he took out a sack containing flour and a pot holding fat and said to me, 'Load these on my back!' Quoth I, 'O Commander of the Faithful, I will carry them for thee.' He rejoined, 'Wilt thou bear my load for me on the Day of Resurrection?' So I put the things on his back, and we set off, running, till we threw down the sack hard by her. Then he took out some of the flour and put it in the cauldron; and, saying to the woman, 'Leave it to me,' he began blowing the fire under the cauldron. Now he was a long bearded man[FN#278] and I saw the smoke issuing from between the hairs of his beard till the flour was cooked, when he took some of the fat and threw it in and said to the woman, 'Bed them while I cool it for them.' So they fell to eating till they had eaten their fill, and he left the rest with her. Then he turned to me and said, 'O Aslam, I see it was indeed hunger made them weep; and I am glad I did not go away ere I found out the cause of the light I saw.'—And Shahrazad per ceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Sixty-fourth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman continued, ""It is related that Omar passed by a flock of sheep, kept by a Mameluke, and asked him to sell him a sheep. He answered, 'They are not mine.' 'Thou art the man I sought,' said Omar, and bought him and freed him; whereupon the slave exclaimed, 'O Allah, as thou hast bestowed on me the lesser emancipation; so vouchsafe me the greater!'[FN#279] It is also said that Omar bin al- Khattab was wont to give his servants sweet milk and himself eat coarse fare, and to clothe them softly and himself wear rough garments. He rendered unto all men their due, and exceeded in his giving to them. He once gave a man four thousand dirhams and added thereto a thousand, wherefore it was said to him, 'Why dost thou not increase to thy son as thou increasest to this man?' He answered, 'This man's father stood firm at the battle day of Ohod.'[FN#280] Al-Hasan relates that Omar once came back from foray with much money, and that Hafsah[FN#281] approached him and said, 'O Commander of the Faithful, the due of kinship!' 'O Hafsah!' replied he, 'verily Allah hath enjoined us to satisfy the dues of kinship, but not with the monies of the True Believers. Indeed, thou pleasest"" thy family, but thou angerest thy father.' And she went away trailing her skirts.[FN#282] The son of Omar said, 'I implored the Lord to show me my father one year after his death, till at last I saw him wiping the sweat from his brow and asked him, 'How is it with thee, O my father?' He answered, 'But for my Lord's mercy thy father surely had perished.' Then said Nuzhat al-Zaman, ""Hear, O auspicious King, the second division of the first chapter of the instances of the followers of the Apostle and other holy men. Saith Al Hasan al-Basrí,[FN#283] Not a soul of the sons of Adam goeth forth of the world without regretting three things,- failure to enjoy what he hath amassed, failure to compass what he hoped, failure to provide himself with sufficient viaticum for that hereto he goeth.[FN#284] It was said of Sufyan,[FN#285] 'Can a man be a religious and yet possess wealth?' He replied, 'Yes, so he be patient when grieved and be thankful when he hath received.' Abdullah bin Shaddád, being about to die, sent for his son Mohammed and admonished him, saying, 'O my son, I see the Summoner of Death summoning me, and so I charge thee to fear Allah both in public and private, to praise Allah and to be soothfastin thy speech, for such praise bringeth increase of prosperity, and piety in itself is the best of provision for the next world; even as saith one of the poets,

'I see not happiness lies in gathering gold; * The man most pious
is man happiest:
In truth the fear of God is best of stores, * And God shall make
the pious choicely blest.'
Then quoth Nuzhat al-Zaman, ""Let the King also give ear to these notes from the second section of the first chapter."" He asked her 'What be they?'; and she answered, ""When Omar bin Abd al-Azíz[FN# 286] succeeded to the Caliphate, he went to his household and laying hands on all that was in their hold, put it into the public treasury. So the Banu Umayyah flew for aid to his father's sister, Fátimah, daughter of Marwan, and she sent to him saying, 'I must needs speak to thee.' So she came to him by night and, when he had made her alight from her beast and sit down, he said to her, 'O aunt, it is for thee to speak first, since thou hast some thing to ask: tell me then what thou wouldst with me.' Replied she, 'O Commander of the Faithful, it is thine to speak first, for thy judgment perceiveth that which is hidden from the intelligence of others.' Then said Omar, 'Of a verity Allah Almighty sent Mohammed as a blessing to some and a bane to others; and He elected for him those with him, and commissioned him as His Apostle and took him to Himself,'—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Sixty-fifth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman continued thus, ""Said Omar, 'Verily Allah commissioned as His Apostle Mohammed (upon whom be the benediction of Allah and His salvation!), for a blessing to some and a bane to others; and He elected for him those with him and took him to Himself, leaving the people a stream whereof they might drink. After him Abu Bakr[FN#287] the Truth teller became Caliph and he left the river as it was, doing what was pleasing to Allah. Then arose Omar and worked a work and strove in holy war and strife where of none might do the like. But when Othman arose to power he diverted a streamlet from the stream, and Mu'awiyah in his turn diverted from it several streamlets; and without ceasing in like manner, Yezid and the Banu Marwán such as Abd al-Malik and Walíd and Sulaymán[FN#288] drew away water from the stream, and the main course dried up, till rule devolved upon me, and now I am minded to restore the stream to its normal condition.' When Fatimah heard this, she said, 'I came wishing only to speak and confer with thee, but if this be thy word, I have nothing to say to thee.' Then she returned to the Ommiades and said to them, 'Now take ye the consequences of your act when ye allied yourselves by marriage with Omar bin al-Khattab.'[FN#289] And it is also said that when Omar was about to die, he gathered his children round him, and Maslamah[FN#290] bin Abd al-Malik said to him, 'O Prince of the Faithful, how wilt thou leave thy children paupers and thou their protector? None can hinder thee in thy lifetime from giving them what will suffice them out of the treasury; and this indeed were better than leaving the good work to him who shall rule after thee.' Omar looked at him with a look of wrath and wonder and presently replied, 'O Maslamah, I have defended them from this sin all the days of my life, and shall I make them miserable after my death? Of a truth my sons are like other men, either obedient to Almighty Allah who will prosper them, or disobedient and I will not help them in their disobedience. Know, O Maslamah, that I was present, even as thou, when such an one of the sons of Marwanwas buried, and I fell asleep by him and saw him in a dream given over to one of the punishments of Allah, to whom belong Honour and Glory! This terrified me and made me tremble, and I vowed to Allah, that if ever I came to power, I would not do such deeds as the dead man had done. I have striven to fulfil this vow all the length of my life and I hope to die in the mercy of my Lord.' Quoth Maslamah, 'A certain man died and I was present at his burial, and when all was over I fell asleep and I saw him as a sleeper seeth a dream, walking in a garden of flowing waters clad in white clothes. He came up to me and said: 'O Maslamah, it is for the like of this that rulers should rule.' Many are the instances of this kind, and quoth one of the men of authority, 'I used to milk the ewes in the Caliphate of Omar bin Abd al-Aziz, and one day I met a shepherd, among whose sheep I saw a wolf or wolves. I thought them to be dogs, for I had never before seen wolves; so I asked, 'What dost thou with these dogs?' 'They are not dogs, but wolves,' answered the shepherd. Quoth I, 'Can wolves be with sheep and not hurt them?' Quoth he, 'When the head is whole, the body is whole.'[FN#291] Omar bin Abd al-Aziz once preached from a pulpit of clay and, after praising and glorifying Allah Almighty, said three words as follows, 'O folk, make clean your inmost hearts, that your outward lives may be dean to your brethren, and abstain ye from the things of the world. Know that between us and Adam there is no one man alive among the dead. Dead are Abd al- Malik and those who forewent him, and Omar also shall die and those who forewent him.' Asked Maslamah, 'O Commander of the Faithful, an we set a pillow behind thee, wilt thou lean on it a little while?' But Omar answered, 'I fear lest it be a fault about my neck on Resurrection Day.' Then he gasped with the death rattle and fell back in a faint; whereupon Fatimah cried out, saying, 'Ho, Maryam! Ho, Muzahim![FN#292] Ho, such an one! Look to this man!' And she began to pour water on him weeping, till he revived from his swoon; and, seeing her in tears said to her, 'What causeth thee to weep, O Fatimah?' She replied, 'O Commander of the Faithful, I saw thee lying prostrate before us and thought of thy prostration in death before Almighty Allah, of thy departure from the world and of thy separation from us. This is what made me weep.' Answered he, 'Enough, O Fatimah, for indeed thou exceedest.' Then he would have risen, but fell down and Fatimah strained him to her and said, 'Thou art to me as my father and my mother, O Commander of the Faithful! We cannot speak to thee, all of us.' Then quoth Nuzhat al-Zaman to her brother Sharrkan and the four Kazis, ""Here endeth the second section of the first chapter.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Sixty-sixth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman said to her brother Sharrkan and the four Kazis, ""Here endeth the second section of the first chapter. And it so happened that Omar bin Abd al-Aziz wrote to the people of the festival at Meccah as follows, 'I call Allah to witness, in the Holy Month, in the Holy City and on the day of the Greater Pilgrimage,[FN#293] that I am innocent of your oppression and of his wrongs that doth wrong you, in that I have neither commanded this nor purposed it, neither hath any report of aught thereof hitherto reached me, nor have I compassed any knowledge thereof; and I trust that a cause for pardon will be found in that none hath authority from me to oppress any man, for I shall assuredly be questioned concerning every one oppress. And if any of my officers swerve from the right and act otherwise than the Holy Book and the Traditions of the Apostle do authorise, obey him not so that he may return to the way of righteousness.' He said also (Allah accept of him!), 'I do not wish to be relieved from death, because it is the supreme thing for which the True Believer is rewarded.' Quoth one of authority, 'I went to the Prince of the Faithful, Omarbin Abd al-Aziz, who was then Caliph, and saw before him twelve dirhams, which he ordered for deposit in the public treasury. So I said to him, 'O Commander of the Faithful, thou impoverishest thy children and reducest them to beggary having nothing whereon to live. An thou wouldst appoint somewhat by will to them and to those who are poor of the people of thy house, it were well.' 'Draw near to me,' answered he: so I drew near to him and he said, 'Now as for thy saying, 'Thou beggarest thy children; provide for them and for the poor of thy household,' it is without reason; for Allah of a truth will replace me to my children and to the poor of my house, and He will be their guardian. Verily, they are like other men; he who feareth Allah, right soon will Allah provide for him a happy issue, and he that is addicted to sins, I will not up hold him in his sin against Allah.' Then he summoned his sons who numbered twelve, and when he beheld them his eyes dropped tears and presently he said to them, 'Your Father is between two things; either ye will be well to do, and your parent will enter the fire, or ye will be poor and your parent will enter Paradise; and your father's entry into Paradise is liefer to him than that ye should be well to do.[FN#294] So arise and go, Allah be your helper, for to Him I commit your affairs!' Khálid bin Safwán[FN#295] said, 'Yúsuf bin Omar[FN#296] accompanied me to Hishám bin Abd al-Malik,[FN#297] and as I met him he was coming forth with his kinsmen and attendants. He alighted and a tent was pitched for him. When the people had taken their seats, I came up to the side of the carpet whereon he sat reclining and looked at him; and, waiting till my eyes met his eyes, bespoke him thus, 'May Allah fulfil His bounty to thee, O Commander of the Faithful, I have an admonition for thee, which hath come down to us from the history of the Kings preceding thee!' At this, he sat up whenas he had been reclining and said to me, 'Bring what thou hast, O son of Safwan!' Quoth I, 'O Commander of the Faithful, one of the Kings before thee went forth in a time before this thy time, to this very country and said to his companions, 'Saw ye ever any state like mine and say me, hath such case been given to any man even as it hath been given unto me?' Now there was with him a man of those who survive to bear testimony to Truth; upholders of the Right and wayfarers in its highway, and he said to him, 'O King, thou askest of a grave matter. Wilt thou give me leave to answer?' 'Yes,' replied the King, and the other said, 'Dost thou judge thy present state to be short lasting or ever lasting?' 'It is temporary,' replied the King. 'How then,' rejoined the man, 'do I see thee exulting in that which thou wilt enjoy but a little while and whereof thou wilt be questioned for a long while and for the rendering an account whereof thou shalt be as a pledge which is pawned?' Quoth the King, 'Whither shall I flee and what must I seek for me?' 'That thou abide in thy kingship,' replied the other, 'or else robe thee in rags[FN#298] and apply thyself to obey Almighty Allah thy Lord until thine appointed hour. I will come to thee again at daybreak.' Khalid bin Safwan further relates that the man knocked at the door at dawn and behold, the King had put off his crown and resolved to become an anchorite, for the stress of his exhortation. When Hishám bin Abd al-Malik heard this, he wept till his beard was wet, and, bidding his rich apparel be put off, shut himself up in his palace. Then the grandees and dependents came to Khalid and said, 'What is this thou hast done with the Commander of the Faithful? Thou hast troubled his pleasure and disturbed his life!' Then quoth Nuzhat al-Zaman, addressing herself to Sharrkan, ""How many instances of admonition are there not in this chapter! Of a truth I cannot report all appertaining to this head in a single sitting,""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Sixty-seventh Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman continued, speaking to Sharrkan, ""Know, O King, that in this chapter be so many instances of admonition that of a truth I cannot report all appertaining to this head in a single sitting but, with length of days, O King of the age, all will be well."" There said the Kazis, ""O King, of a truth this damsel is the wonder of the world, and of our age the unique pearl! Never heard we her like in the length of time or in the length of our lives."" And they called down blessings on the King and went away. Then Sharrkan turned to his attendants and said, ""Begin ye to prepare the marriage festival and make ready food of all kinds."" So they forthright did his bidding as regards the viands, and he commanded the wives of the Emirs and Wazirs and Grandees depart not until the time of the wedding banquet and of the unveiling of the bride. Hardly came the period of afternoon prayer when the tables were spread with whatso heart can desire or eye can delight in of roast meats and geese and fowls; and the subjects ate till they were satisfied. Moreover, Sharrkan had sent for all the singing women of Damascus and they were present, together with every slave girl of the King and of the notables who knew how to sing. And they went up to the palace in one body. When the evening came and darkness starkened they lighted candles, right and left, from the gate of the citadel to that of the palace; and the Emirs and Wazirs and Grandees marched past before King Sharrkan, whilst the singers and the tire women took the damsel to dress and adorn her, but found she needed no adornment. Meantime King Sharrkan went to the Hammam and coming out, sat down on his seat of estate, whilst they paraded the bride before him in seven different dresses: after which they eased her of the weight of her raiment and ornaments and gave such injunctions as are enjoined upon virgins on their wedding nights. Then Sharrkan went in unto her and took her maidenhead;[FN#299] and she at once conceived by him and, when she announced it, he rejoiced with exceeding joy and commanded the savants to record the date of her conception. On the morrow he went forth and seated himself on his throne, and the high officers came in to him and gave him joy. Then he called his private secretary and bade him write a letter to his father, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, saying that he had bought him a damsel, who excels in learning and good breeding and who is mistress of all kinds of knowledge. Moreover he wrote, ""There is no help but that I send her to Baghdad to visit my brother Zau al-Makan and my sister Nuzhat al-Zaman. I have set her free and married her and she hath conceived by me."" And he went on to praise her wit and salute his brother and sister together with the Wazir Dandan and all the Emirs. Then he sealed the letter and despatched it to his father by a post courier who was absent a whole month, after which time he returned with the answer and presented it in the presence. Sharrkan took it and read as follows, ""After the usual Bismillah, this is from the afflicted distracted man, from him who hath lost his children and home by bane and ban, King Omar bin al- Nu'uman, to his son Sharrkan. Know that, since thy departure from me, the place is become contracted upon me, so that no longer I have power of patience nor can I keep my secret: and the cause thereof is as follows. It chanced that when I went forth to hunt and course Zau al-Makan sought my leave to fare Hijaz wards, but I, fearing for him the shifts of fortune, forbade him therefrom until the next year or the year after. My absence while sporting and hunting endured for a whole month""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Sixty-eighth night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Omar bin al-Nu'uman wrote in his letter, ""My absence while sporting and hunting endured for a whole month, and when I returned I found that thy brother and sister had taken somewhat of money and had set out with the pilgrim caravan for pilgrimage by stealth. When I knew this, the wide world narrowed on me, O my son! but I awaited the return of the caravan, hoping that haply they would come back with it. Accordingly, when the palmers appeared I asked concerning the twain, but they could give me no news of them; so I donned mourning for them, being heavy at heart, and in sleep I have no part and I am drowned in the tears of my eyes."" Then he wrote in verse,

""That pair in image quits me not one single hour, * Whom in my
             heart's most honourable place I keep:
Sans hope of their return I would not live one hour, * Without my
             dreams of them I ne'er would stretch me in sleep.""

The letter went on, ""And after the usual salutations to thee and thine, I command thee neglect no manner of seeking news of them for indeed this is a shame to us."" When Sharrkan read the letter he felt grief for his father and joy for the loss of his brother and sister. Then he took the missive and went in with it to Nuzhat al-Zaman who knew not that he was her brother, nor he that she was his sister, albeit he often visited her both by night and by day till the months were accomplished and she sat down on the stool of delivery. Allah made the child birth easy to her and she bare a daughter, whereupon she sent for Sharrkan and seeing him she said to him, ""This is thy daughter: name her as thou wilt."" Quoth he, ""It is usual to name children on the seventh day after birth.[FN#300]"" Then he bent over the child to kiss it and he saw, hung about its neck, a jewel, which he knew at once for one of those which Princess Abrizah had brought from the land of the Greeks. Now when he saw the jewel hanging from his babe's neck he recognised it right well, his senses fled and wrath seized on him; his eyes rolled in rage and he looked at Nuzhat al- Zaman and said to her, ""Whence hadst thou this jewel, O slave girl?"" When she heard this from Sharrkan she replied, ""I am thy lady, and the lady of all in thy palace! Art thou not ashamed to say to me Slave girl? I am a Queen, daughter of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman."" Hearing this, he was seized with trembling and hung his head earthwards,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Sixty-ninth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Sharrkan heard these words, his heart fluttered and his colour waxed yellow and he was seized with trembling and he hung his head earthwards, for he knew that she was his sister by the same father. Then he lost his senses; and, when he revived, he abode in amazement, but did not discover his identity to her and asked, O my lady, say, art thou in sooth the daughter of King Omar bin al- Nu'uman?"" ""Yes,"" answered she; and he continued, ""Tell me the cause of thy leaving thy sire and of thy being sold for a slave."" So she related to him all that had befallen her from beginning to end, how she had left her brother sick in the Sanctified City, Jerusalem, and how the Badawi had kidnapped her and had sold her to the trader. When Sharrkan heard this, he was certified of her being his sister on the sword side and said to himself, ""How can I have my sister to wife? By Allah, needs must I marry her to one of my chamberlains; and, if the thing get wind, I will declare that I divorced her before consummation and married her to my Chief Chamberlain."" Then he raised his head and sighing said, ""O Nuzhat al-Zaman, thou art my very sister and I cry: 'I take refuge with Allah from this sin whereinto we have fallen,' for I am Sharrkan, son of Omar bin al-Nu'uman."" She looked at him and knew he spoke the truth; and, becoming as one demented, she wept and buffeted her face, exclaiming, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah! Verily have we fallen into mortal sin![FN#301] What shall I do and what shall I say to my father and my mother when they ask me, Whence hadst thou thy daughter?"" Quoth Sharrkan, ""It were meetest that I marry thee to my Chamberlain and let thee bring up my daughter in his house, that none may know thou be my sister. This hath befallen us from Almighty Allah for a purpose of his own, and nothing shall cover us but thy marriage with this Chamberlain, ere any know."" Then he fell to comforting her and kissing her head and she asked him, ""What wilt thou call the girl?"" ""Call her Kuzia Fakán,""[FN#302] answered he. Then he gave the mother in marriage to the Chief Chamberlain, and transferred her to his house with the child, which they reared on the laps of the slave girls, and fed with milk and dosed with powders. Now all this occurred whilst the brother, Zau al-Makan, still tarried with the Fireman at Damascus. One day there came to King Sharrkan a courier from his father, with a letter which he took and read and found therein, ""After the Bismillah know, O beloved King, that I am afflicted with sore affliction for the loss of my children: sleep ever faileth me and wakefulness ever assaileth me. I send thee this letter that, as soon as thou receivest it, thou make ready the monies and the tribute, and send them to us, together with the damsel whom thou hast bought and taken to wife; for I long to see her and hear her discourse; more especially because there hath come to us from Roumland an old woman of saintly bearing and with her be five damsels high bosomed virgins, endowed with knowledge and good breeding and all arts and sciences befitting mortals to know; and indeed tongue faileth me to describe this old woman and these who with her wend; for of a truth they are compendiums of perfections in learning and accomplishments. As soon as I saw them I loved them, and I wished to have them in my palace and in the compass of my hand; for none of the Kings owneth the like of them; so I asked the old woman their price and she answered, 'I will not sell them but for the tribute of Damascus.' And I, by Allah, did not hold this price exorbitant, indeed it is but little, for each one of them is worth the whole valuation. So I agreed to that and took them into my palace, and they remain in my possession. Wherefore do thou forward the tribute to us that the woman may return to her own country; and send to us the damsel to the end that she may dispute with them before the doctors; and, if she prevail over them, I will return her to thee accompanied by the tribute of Baghdad.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Seventieth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Omar son of Al-Nu'uman said in his letter, ""And send to us the damsel to the end that she may dispute with them before the doctors and, if she prevail over them, I will return her to thee accompanied with the tribute of Baghdad."" As soon as Sharrkan knew the contents, he went in to his brother in law and said to him, ""Bring the damsel to whom I married thee;"" and when she came he showed her the letter and said, ""O my sister! what answer wouldst thou advise me make to this letter?"" Replied she, ""Seek advice from thyself!"" and presently added (for she yearned after her people and her native land), ""Send me together with my husband the Chamberlain, to Baghdad, that I may tell my father my tale and let him know whatso befel me with the Badawi who sold me to the merchant, and that I also inform him how thou boughtest me of the trader and gavest me in marriage to the Chamberlain, after setting me free."" ""Be it so,"" replied Sharrkan. Then Sharrkan took his daughter, Kuzia Fakan, and committed her to the charge of the wet nurses and the eunuchs, and he made ready the tribute in haste, bidding the Chamberlain travel with the Princess and the treasure to Baghdad. He also furnished him two travelling litters one for himself and the other for his wife. And the Chamberlain replied, ""To hear is to obey."" Moreover Sharrkan collected camels and mules and wrote a letter to his father and committed it to the Chamberlain; then he bade farewell to his sister, after he had taken the jewel from her and hung it round his daughter's neck by a chain of pure gold; and she and her husband set out for Baghdad the same night. Now it so happened that Zau al-Makan and his friend the Fireman had come forth from the hut in which they were, to see the spectacle, and they beheld camels and Bukhti[FN#303] dromedaries and bât-mules and torches and lanterns alight; and Zau al-Makan enquired about the loads and their owner and was told that it was the tribute of Damascus going to King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, Lord of the City of Baghdad. He then asked, ""Who be the leader of the caravan?"" and they answered, ""The Head Chamberlain who hath married the damsel so famous for learning and science."" Thereupon Zau al-Makan wept with bitter weeping and was minded of his mother and his father and his sister and his native land, and he said to the Stoker, ""I will join this caravan and, little by little, will journey homewards."" Quoth the Fireman, ""I would not suffer thee to travel single handed from the Holy City to Damascus, then how shall I be sure of thy safety when thou farest for Baghdad? But I will go with thee and care for thee till thou effectest thine object."" ""With joy and good will,"" answered Zau al-Makan. Then the Fireman get him ready for the journey and hired an ass and threw saddle bags over it and put therein something of provaunt; and, when all was prepared, he awaited the passage of the caravan. And presently the Chamberlain came by on a dromedary and his footmen about him. Then Zau al-Ma ken mounted the ass and said to his companion, ""Do thou mount with me."" But he replied, ""Not so: I will be thy servant."" Quoth Zau al-Makan, ""There is no help for it but thou ride awhile."" ""'Tis well,"" quoth the Stoker; ""I will ride when I grow tired."" Then said Zau al-Makan, ""O my brother, soon shalt thou see how I will deal with thee, when I come to my own folk."" So they fared on till the sun rose and,When it was the hour of the noonday sleep[FN#304] the Chamberlain called a halt and they alighted and reposed and watered their camels. Then he gave the signal for departure and, after five days, they came to the city of Hamáh,[FN#305] where they set down and made a three days' halt;—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Seventy-first Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that they halted in the city of Hamah three days; they then fared forwards and ceased not travelling till they reached another city. Here also they halted three days and thence they travelled till they entered the province Diyár Bakr. Here blew on them the breezes of Baghdad, and Zau al-Makan bethought him of his father and mother and native land, and how he was returning to his sire without his sister: so he wept and sighed and complained, and his regrets grew on him, and he began improvising these couplets,

""Sweetheart! How long must I await by so long suffering teed? *
            Nor cometh messenger to tell me where thou dost abide:
Ah me! in very sooth our meeting time was short enow: * Would
            Heaven shorter prove to me the present parting-tide!
Now trend my hand and open my robe and thou within shall sight *
            How wasted are the limbs of me and yet the waste I hide:
When say they 'Comfort take for loss of love' I but reply * 'By
            Allah, till the Day of Doom no comfort shall betide!' ""

Thereupon said to him the Fireman, ""Leave this weeping and wailing, for we are near the Chamberlain's tent."" Quoth Zau al- Makan, ""Needs must I recite somewhat of verse; haply it may quench the fire of my heart."" ""Allah upon thee,"" cried the other, ""cease this lamentation till thou come to shine own country; then do what thou wilt, and I will be with thee wherever thou art."" Replied Zau al-Makan, ""By Allah! I cannot forbear from this!"" Then he turned his face towards Baghdad and the moon was shining brightly and shedding her light on the place, and Nuzhat al-Zaman could not sleep that night, but was restless and called to mind her brother and wept. And while she was in tears, he heard Zau al-Makan weeping and improvising the following distichs,

'Al-Yaman's[FN#306] leven-gleam I see, * And sore despair
            despaireth me
For friend who erst abode wi' me * Crowning my cup with gladdest
           gree:
It minds me o' one who jilted me * To mourn my bitter liberty.
Say sooth, thou fair sheet lightning! shall * We meet once more
           in joy and glee?
O blamer! spare to me thy blame * My Lord hath sent this dule to
            dree,
Of friend who left me, fain to flee; * Of Time that breeds
            calamity:
All bliss hath fled the heart of me * Since Fortune proved mine
            enemy.
He[FN#307] brimmed a bowl of merest pine, * And made me drain the
            dregs, did he:
I see me, sweetheart, dead and gone * Ere I again shall gaze on
           thee.
Time! prithee bring our childhood back, * Restore our happy
            infancy,
When joy and safety 'joyed we * From shafts that now they shoot
            at me!
Who aids the hapless stranger wight, * That nights in fright and
            misery,
That wastes his days in lonely grief, * For 'Time's
             Delight'[FN#308] no more must be?
Doomed us despite our will to bear * The hands of base bores cark
             and care.""

When he ended his verse he cried out and fell down in a fainting fit. This is how it fared with him; but as regards Nuzhat al- Zaman, when she heard that voice in the night, her heart was at rest and she rose and in her joy she called the Chief Eunuch, who said to her, ""What is thy will?"" Quoth she, ""Arise and bring me him who recited verses but now."" Replied he, ""Of a truth I did not hear him""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Seventy-second Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Nuzhat Al-Zaman heard her brother reciting, she called the Chief Eunuch and said to him, ""Go, fetch me the man who is repeating this poetry!"" Replied he, ""Of a truth I heard him not and I wot him not and folks are all sleeping."" But she said, ""Whomsoever thou seest awake, he is the reciter."" So he went, yet found none on wake save the Stoker; for Zau al-Makan was still insensible, and when his companion saw the Eunuch standing by his head he was afraid of him. Then said the Eunuch, ""Art thou he who repeated poetry but now and my lady heard him?"" The Stoker fancied that the dame was wroth with the reciter; and, being afraid, he replied, ""By Allah, 'twas not I!"" Rejoined the Eunuch, ""Who then was the reciter?: point him out to me. Thou must know who it was, seeing that thou art awake."" The Fireman feared for Zau al- Makan and said in himself, ""Haply the Eunuch will do him some hurt""; so he answered, ""By Allah, I know not who it was."" Said the Eunuch, ""By Allah, thou liest, for there is none on wake here but thou! So needs must thou know him."" ""By Allah,"" replied the Fireman, ""I tell thee the truth!: some passer by, some wayfarer must have recited the verses and disturbed me and kept me awake; Allah requite him!"" Quoth the Eunuch, ""If thou happen upon him, point him out to me and I will lay hands on him and bring him to the door of our lady's litter[FN#309] or do thou take him with thine own hand."" Said the Fireman, ""Go thou back and I will bring him to thee."" So the Eunuch left him and went his ways; and, going in to his mistress, told her all this and said to her, ""None knoweth who it was; it must have been some passer by, some wayfarer."" And she was silent. Meanwhile, Zau al-Makan came to himself and saw that the moon had reached the middle Heavens; the breath of the dawn breeze[FN#310] breathed upon him and his heart was moved to longing and sadness; so he cleared his throat and was about to recite verses, when the Fire man asked him, ""What wilt thou do?"" Answered Zau al-Makan, ""I have a mind to repeat somewhat of poetry, that I may quench therewith the fire of my heart."" Quoth the other, ""Thou knowest not what befel me whilst thou wast a faint, and how I escaped death only by beguiling the Eunuch."" ""Tell me what happened,"" quoth Zau al-Makan. Replied the Stoker, ""Whilst thou wast aswoon there came up to me but now an Eunuch, with a long staff of almond tree wood in his hand, who took to looking in all the people's faces, as they lay asleep, and asked me who it was recited the verses, finding none awake but myself. I told him in reply it was some passerby, some wayfarer; so he went away and Allah delivered me from him; else had he killed me. But first he said to me, 'If thou hear him again, bring him to us.'"" When Zau al-Makan heard this he wept and said, ""Who is it would forbid me to recite? I will surely recite, befal me what may; for I am near mine own land and care for none."" Rejoined the Fireman, ""Thy design is naught save to lose thy life;"" and Zau al-Makan retorted, ""Needs must I recite verses."" ""Verily,"" said the Stoker, ""needs must there be a parting between me and thee in this place, albeit;I had intended not to leave thee, till I had brought thee to thy native city and reunited thee with thy mother and father. Thou hast now tarried with me a year and a half and I have never harmed thee in aught. What ails thee, then, that thou must needs recite verses, seeing that we are tired out with walking and watching and all the folk are asleep, for they require sleep to rest them of their fatigue?"" But Zau al-Makan answered, ""I will not be turned away from my purpose.""[FN#311] Then grief moved him and he threw off concealment and began repeating these couplets,

""Stand thou by the homes and hail the lords of the ruined stead;
          * Cry thou for an answer, belike reply to thee shall be
           sped:
If the night and absence irk thy spirit kindle a torch * Wi'
           repine; and illuminate the gloom with a gleaming greed:
If the snake of the sand dunes hiss, I shall marvel not at all!
           * Let him bite so I bite those beauteous lips of the
           luscious red:
O Eden, my soul hath fled in despite of the maid I love: * Had I
           lost hope of Heaven my heart in despair were dead.""
And he also improvised the two following distichs,

""We were and were the days enthralled to all our wills, *
           Dwelling in union sweet and homed in fairest site:
Who shall restore the home of the beloved, where showed * Light
            of the Place for aye conjoined with Time's
            Delight?''[FN#312]

And as he ceased his verses, he shrieked three shrieks and fell senseless to the ground and the Fireman rose and covered him. When Nuzhat al-Zaman heard the first improvisation, she called to mind her father and her mother and her brother and their whilome home; then she wept and cried at the Eunuch and said to him, ""Woe to thee! He who recited the first time hath recited a second time and I heard him hard by. By Allah, an thou fetch him not to me, I will assuredly rouse the Chamberlain on thee, and he shall beat thee and cast thee out. But take these hundred diners and give them to the singer and bring him to me gently, and do him no hurt. If he refuse, hand to him this purse of a thousand diners, then leave him and return to me and tell me, after thou hast informed thyself of his place and his calling and what countryman he is. Return quickly and linger not.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Seventy-third Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman sent the Eunuch to make enquiries concerning the singer and said, ""Beware how thou come back to me and report, I could not find him."" So the Eunuch went out and laid about the people and trod in their tents, but found none awake, all being asleep for weariness, till he came to the Stoker and saw him sitting up, with his head uncovered. So he drew near and seizing him by the hand, said to him, ""It was thou didst recite the verses!"" The Fireman was afeard for his life and replied, ""No, by Allah, O chief of the people, it was not I!"" But the Eunuch said, ""I will not leave thee till thou show me who it was that recited the verses, for I dread returning to my lady without him."" Now when the Fireman heard these words he feared for Zau al-Makan and wept with exceeding weeping and said to the Eunuch, ""By Allah, it was not I, and I know him not. I only heard some passer by, some wayfarer, recite verses: so do not thou commit sin on me, for I am a stranger and come from the Holy City of Jerusalem; and Abraham, the friend of Allah, be with you all."" ""Rise up and fare with me,"" rejoined the Eunuch, ""and tell my lady this with thine own mouth, for I have seen none awake save thyself."" Quoth the Stoker, ""Hast thou not come and seen me sitting in the place where I now am, and dost thou not know my station? Thou wottest none can stir from his place, except the watchman seize him. So go thou to thy station and if thou again meet any one after this hour reciting aught of poetry, whether he be near or far, it will be I or some one I know, and thou shalt not learn of him but by me."" Then he kissed the Eunuch's head and spake him fair till he went away; but the Castrato fetched a round and, returning secretly, came and stood behind the Fireman, fearing to go back to his mistress without tidings. As soon as he was gone, the Stoker arose and aroused Zau al-Makan and said to him, ""Come, sit up, that I may tell thee what hath happened."" So Zau al-Makan sat up, and his companion told him what had passed, and he answered, ""Let me alone; I will take no heed of this and I care for none, for I am mine own country.""[FN#313] Quoth the Stoker, ""Why wilt thou obey thy flesh and the devil? If thou fear no one, I fear for thee and for my life, so Allah upon thee! recite nothing more of verses till thou come to thine own land. Indeed, I had not deemed thee so ill conditioned. Dost thou not know that this lady is the wife; of the Chamberlain and is minded to chastise thee for disturbing her? Belike, she is ill or restless for fatigue of the journey and the distance of the place from her home, and this is the second time she hath sent the Eunuch to look for thee."" However Zau al-Makan paid no heed to the Fireman's words but cried out a third time and began versifying with these couplets,

""I fly the carper's injury,* Whose carping sorely vexeth me:
He chides and taunts me, wotting not * He burns me but more
            grievously.
The blamer cries 'He is consoled!' * I say, 'My own dear
            land[FN#314] to see:'
They ask, 'Why be that land so dear?' * I say, 'It taught me in
            love to be:'
They ask, 'What raised its dignity?' * I say, 'What made my
            ignomy:'
Whate'er the bitter cup I drain, * Far be fro' me that land to
             flee:
Nor will I bow to those who blame, * And for such love would deal
             me shame.

Hardly had he made an end of his verses and come to a conclusion, when the Eunuch (who had heard him from his hiding place at his head) came up to him; whereupon the Fireman flea end stood afar off to see what passed between them. Then said the Eunuch to Zau al-Makan, ""Peace be with thee, O my lord!"" ""And on thee be peace,"" replied Zau al-Makan, ""and the mercy of Allah and His blessings!"" ""O my lord,"" continued the Eunuch—-And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say,

When it was the Seventy-fourth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Eunuch said to Zau al-Makan, ""O my lord, I have sought thee these several times this night, for my mistress biddeth thee to her."" Quoth Zau al- Makan, ""And who be this bitch that seeketh for me? Allah curse her and curse her husband with her!""[FN#315] And he began to revile the Eunuch, who could make him no answer, because his mistress had charged him to do Zau al-Makan no hurt, nor bring him save of his own especial free will; and, if he would not accompany him, to give him the thousand diners. So the Castrato began to speak him fair and say to him, ""O my lord, take this purse and go with me. We will do thee no upright, O my son, nor wrong thee in aught; but our object is that thou bend thy gracious steps with me to my mistress, to receive her answer and return in weal and safety: and thou shalt have a handsome present as one who bringeth good news."" When Zau al- Makan heard this, he arose and went with the Eunuch and walked among the sleeping folk, stepping over them; whilst the Fireman followed after them from afar, and kept his eye upon him and said to himself, ""Alas the pity of his youth! Tomorrow they will hang him."" And he ceased not following them till he approached their station,[FN#316] without any observing him. Then he stood still and said, ""How base it will be of him, if he say it was I who bade him recite the verses!"" This was the case of the Stoker; but as regards what befel Zau al-Makan, he ceased not walking with the Eunuch till he reached his station and the Castrato went in to Nuzhat al-Zaman and said, ""O my lady, I have brought thee him whom thou soughtest, and he is a youth, fair of face and bearing the marks of wealth and gentle breeding."" When she heard this, her heart fluttered and she cried, ""Let him recite some verses, that I may hear him near hand, and after ask him his name and his condition and his native land."" Then the Eunuch went out to Zau al-Makan and said to him, ""Recite what verses thou knowest, for my lady is here hard by, listening to thee, and after I will ask thee of thy name and thy native country and thy condition."" Replied he, ""With love and gladness but, an thou ask my name, it is erased and my trace is unplaced and my body a waste. I have a story, the beginning of which is not known nor can the end of it be shown, and behold, I am even as one who hath exceeded in wine drinking and who hath not spared himself; one who is afflicted with distempers and who wandereth from his right mind, being perplexed about his case and drowned in the sea of thought."" When Nuzhat al-Zaman heard this, she broke out into excessive weeping and sobbing, and said to the Eunuch, ""Ask him if he have parted from one he loveth even as his mother or father."" The Castrato asked as she bade him, and Zau al-Makan replied, ""Yes, I have parted from every one I loved: but the dearest of all to me was my sister, from whom Fate hath separated me."" When Nuzhat al- Zaman heard this, she exclaimed, ""Allah Almighty reunite him with what he loveth!""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Seventy-fifth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Nuzhat al-Zaman heard his words she said, ""Allah reunite him with what he loveth!"" Then quoth she to the Eunuch, ""Tell him to let me hear somewhat anent his separation from his countrymen and his country."" The Eunuch did so, and Zau al-Makan sighed heavily and began repeating these couplets,[FN#317]

""Is not her love a pledge by all mankind confest? * The house
            that hometh Hinda be forever blest'
Her love all levels; man can reck of naught beside; * Naught or
           before or after can for man have zest
'Tis though the vale is paved with musk and ambergris * That day
           when Hinda's footstep on its face is prest:
Hail to the beauty of our camp, the pride of folk, * The dearling
           who en' Slaves all hearts by her behest:
Allah on 'Time's Delight' send large dropped clouds that teem *
           With genial rain but bear no thunder in their breast.""
And also these,

""I vow to Allah if at home I sight * My sister Nuzhat al-Zamani
           highs
I'll pass the days in joyance and delight * Mid bashful minions,
             maidens soft and white:
To sound of harps in various modes they smite * Draining the
            bowl, while eyes rain lively light
'Neath half closed lids, a sipping lips red bright * By stream
            bank flowing through my garden site.""

When he had finished his verse, Nuzhat al-Zaman lifted up a skirt of the litter curtain and looked at him. As soon as her eyes fell on his face, she knew him for certain and cried out, ""O my brother! O Zau al-Makan!"" He also looked at her and knew her and cried out, ""O my sister! O Nuzhat al-Zaman!"" Then she threw herself upon him and he gathered her to his bosom and the twain fell down in a fainting fit. When the Eunuch saw this case, he wondered at them and throwing over them somewhat to cover them, waited till they should recover. After a while they came to themselves, and Nuzhat al-Zaman rejoiced with exceeding joy: oppression and depression left her and gladness took the mastery of her, and she repeated these verses,

""Time sware my life should fare in woeful waste; * Forsworn art
           Time, expiate thy sin in haste![FN#318]
Comes weal and comes a welcome friend to aid; * To him who brings
           good news, rise, gird thy waist
I spurned old world tales of Eden bliss; * Till came I
            Kausar[FN#319] on those lips

When Zau al-Makan heard this, he pressed his sister to his breast; tears streamed from his eyes for excess of joy and he repeated these couplets,[FN#320]

""Long I lamented that we fell apart, * While tears repentant
            railed from these eyne;
And sware, if Time unite us twain once more, * 'Severance' shall
            never sound from tongue of mine:
Joy hath so overwhelmed me that excess * Of pleasure from mine
            eyes draws gouts of brine:
Tears, O mine eyes, have now become your wont * Ye weep for
            pleasure and you weep for pine!""

They sat awhile at the litter door till she said to him, ""Come with me into the litter and tell me all that hath befallen thee, and I will tell thee what happened to me."" So they entered and Zau al-Maken said, ""Do thou begin thy tale."" Accordingly she told him all that had come to her since their separation at the Khan and what had happened to her with the Badawi; how the merchant had bought her of him and had taken her to her brother Sharrkan and had sold her to him; how he had freed her at the time of buying; how he had made a marriage contract with her and had gone in to her and how the King, their sire, had sent and asked for her from Sharrkan. Then quoth she, ""Praised be Allah who hath vouchsafed thee to me and ordained that, even as we left our father together, so together shall we return to him!"" And she added, ""Of a truth my brother Sharrkan gave me in marriage to this Chamberlain that he might carry me to my father. And this is what befel me from first to last; so now tell me how it hath fared with thee since I left thee."" Thereupon he told her all that had happened to him from beginning to end; and how Allah vouchsafed to send the Fireman to him, and how he had journeyed with him and spent his money on him and had served him night and day. She praised the Stoker for this and Zau al-Makan added, ""Of a truth, O my sister, this Fireman hath dealt with me in such benevolent wise as would not lover with lass nor sire with son, for that he fasted and gave me to eat, and he walked whilst he made me ride; and I owe my life to him."" Said she, ""Allah willing, we will requite him for all this, according to our power."" Then she called the Eunuch, who came and kissed Zau al- Makan's hand, and she said, ""Take thy reward for glad tidings, O face of good omen! It was thy hand reunited me with my brother; so the purse I gave thee and all in it are thine. But now go to thy master and bring him quickly to me."" The Castrato rejoiced and, going in to the Chamberlain, him to his mistress. Accordingly, he came in to his wife and finding Zau al-Makan with her, asked who he was. So she told him all that had befallen them both, first and last, and added, ""Know, O Chamberlain, that thou hast married no slave girl; far from it, thou hast taken to wife the daughter of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman for I am Nuzhat al- Zaman, and this is my brother, Zau al-Makan."" When the Chamberlain heard the story he knew it to be sooth, and its manifest truth appeared to him and he was certified that he was become King Omar bin al-Nu'uman's son in law, so he said to himself, "" 'Twill be my fate to be made viceroy of some province.""[FN#321] Then he went up to Zau al-Makan and gave him joy of his safety and reunion with his sister, and bade his servants forthwith make him ready a tent and one of the best of his own horses to ride. Thereupon said Nuzhat al-Zaman, ""We are now near our country and I would be left alone with my brother, that we may enjoy each other's company and take our fill of it ere we reach Baghdad; for we have been parted a long, long time."" ""Be it as thou biddest,"" replied the Chamberlain, and, going forth from them, sent them wax candles and various kinds of sweetmeats, together with three suits of the costliest for Zau al-Makan. Then he returned to the litter and related the good he had done and Nuzhat al-Zaman said to him, ""Bid the Eunuch bring me the Fireman and give him a horse to ride and ration him with a tray of food morning and evening, and let him be forbidden to leave us."" The Chamberlain called the Castrato and charged him to do accordingly; so he replied, ""I hear and I obey;"" and he took his pages with him and went out in search of the Stoker till he found him in the rear of the caravan, girthing his ass and preparing for flight. The tears were running adown his cheeks, out of fear for his life and grief for his separation from Zau al-Makan; and he was saying to himself, ""Indeed, I warned him for the love of Allah, but he would not listen to me; Oh would I knew what is become of him!"" Ere he had done speaking the Eunuch was standing by his head whilst the pages surrounded him The Fireman turned and seeing the Eunuch and the pages gathered around him became yellow with fear,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Seventy-sixth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Stoker girthed his ass for flight and bespake himself, saying, ""Oh would I knew what is become of him!""; ere he had done speaking the Castrato was standing by his head and his side muscles quivered for fear and he lifted up his voice and cried, ""Verily he knoweth not the value of the good offices I have done him! I believe he hath denounced me to the Eunuch (hence these pages et about me) and he hath made me an accomplice in his crime."" Then the effeminated one cried at him, saying, ""Who was it recited the verses? O liar! why didst thou say, 'I never repeated these couplets, nor do I know who repeated them;' when it was thy companion? But now I will not leave thee between this place and Baghdad, and what betideth thy comrade shall betide thee."" Quoth the Fireman, ""What I feared hath befallen me."" And he repeated this couplet,

""'Twas as I feared the coming ills discerning: * But unto Allah we are all returning.""

Then the Eunuch cried upon the pages, saying, ""Take him off the ass."" So they carried him along with the caravan, surrounded by the pages, as the white contains the black of the eye; and the Castrato said to them, ""If a hair of him be lost, you will be lost with it."" And he bade them privily treat him with honour and not humiliate him. But when the Stoker saw himself beset by the pages, he despaired of his life and turning to the Eunuch, said to him, ""O Chief, I am neither this youth's brother nor am I akin to him, nor is he sib to me; but I was a Fireman in a Hammam and found him cast out, in his sickness, on the dung heap."" Then the caravan fared on and the Stoker wept and imagined in himself a thousand things, whilst the Eunuch walked by his side and told him nothing, but said to him, ""Thou disturbedst our mistress by reciting verses, thou and this youth: but fear nothing for thy self;"" and kept laughing at him the while to himself. Whenever the caravan halted, they served him with food, and he and the Castrato ate from one dish.[FN#322] Then the Eunuch bade his lads bring a gugglet of sugared sherbet and, after drinking himself, gave it to the Fireman, who drank; but all the while his tears never dried, out of fear for his life and grief for his separation from Zau al-Makan and for what had befallen them in their strangerhood. So they both travelled on with the caravan, whilst the Chamberlain now rode by the door of his wife's litter, in attendance on Zau al-Makan and his sister, and now gave an eye to the Fireman; and Nuzhat al-Zaman and her brother occupied themselves with converse and mutual condolence; and they ceased not after this fashion till they came within three days' journey from Baghdad. Here they alighted at eventide and rested till the morning morrowed; and as they awoke and they were about to load the beasts, behold, there appeared afar off a great cloud of dust that darkened the firmament till it became black as gloomiest night.[FN#323] Thereupon the Chamberlain cried out to them, ""Stay, and your loading delay!""; then, mounting with his Mamelukes, rode forward in the direction of the dust cloud. When they drew near, suddenly appeared under it a numerous conquering host like the full tide sea, with flags and standards, drums and kettledrums, horsemen and footmen. The Chamberlain marvelled at this; and when the troops saw him, there detached itself from amongst them a plump of five hundred cavaliers, who fell upon him and his suite and surrounded them, five for one; whereupon said he to them, ""What is the matter and what are these troops, that ye do this with us?"" Asked they, ""Who art thou; and whence comest thou, and whither art thou bound?"" and he answered, ""I am the Chamberlain of the Emir of Damascus, King Sharrkan, son of Omar bin al-Nu'uman, Lord of Baghdad and of the land of Khorasan, and I bring tribute and presents from him to his father in Baghdad."" When the horsemen heard his words they let their head kerchiefs fall over their faces and wept, saying, ""In very sooth King Omar is dead and he died not but of poison. So fare ye forwards; no harm shall befal you till you join his Grand Wazir, Dandan."" Now when the Chamberlain heard this, he wept sore and exclaimed, ""Oh for our disappointment in this our journey!"" Then he and all his suite wept till they had come up with the host and sought access to the Wazir Dandan, who granted an interview and called a halt and, causing his pavilion to be pitched, sat down on a couch therein and commanded to admit the Chamberlain. Then he bade him be seated and questioned him; and he replied that he was Chamberlain to the Emir of Damascus and was bound to King Omar with presents and the tribute of Syria. The Wazir, hearing the mention of King Omar's name, wept and said, ""King Omar is dead by poison, and upon his dying the folk fell out amongst themselves as to who should succeed him, until they were like to slay one another on this account; but the notables and grandees and the four Kazis interposed and all the people agreed to refer the matter to the decision of the four judges and that none should gainsay them. So it was agreed that we go to Damascus and fetch thence the King's son, Sharrkan, and make him Sultan over his father's realm. And amongst them were some who would have chosen the cadet, Zau Al-Makan, for, quoth they, his name be Light of the Place, and he hath a sister Nuzhat al-Zaman highs, the Delight of the Time; but they set out five years ago for Al-Hijaz and none wotteth what is become of them."" When the Chamberlain heard this, he knew; that his wife had told him the truth of her adventures; and he grieved with sore grief for the death of King Omar, albeit he joyed with exceeding joy, especially at the arrival of Zau al-Makan, for that he would now become Sultan of Baghdad in his father's stead—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Seventy-seventh Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Sharrkan's Chamberlain heard of the death of King Omar bin al- Nu'uman he mourned, but he rejoiced because of his wife and her brother Zau al-Makan who would become Sultan of Baghdad in his father's stead. So he turned to the Wazir Dandan and said to him, ""Verily your tale is a wonder of wonders! Know, O Chief Wazir, that here, where you have encountered me, Allah hath given you rest from fatigue and bringeth you your desire after the easiest of fashions, for that His Almighty Will restoreth to you Zau al-Makan and his sister Nuzhat al-Zaman; whereby we will settle the matter as we easily can."" When the Minister heard these words he rejoiced with great joy and said, ""O Chamberlain, tell me the tale of the twain and what befel them and the cause of their long absence."" So he repeated to him the whole story and told him that Nuzhat al-Zaman was his wife and related to him the adventures of Zau al-Makan from first to last. As soon as he had ended his tale, the Wazir sent for the Emirs and Wazirs and Chief Officers and acquainted them with the matter; whereat they rejoiced with great joy and wondered at the happy chance. Then they gathered in a body and went in to the Chamberlain and did their service to him, kissing the ground between his hands; and the Wazir Dandan also rose and went out to meet him and stood before him in honour. After this, the Chamberlain held on that day a Divan council; and he and the Wazir sat upon a throne, whilst all the Emirs and Grandees and Officers of State took their places before them, according to their several ranks.[FN#324] Then they melted sugar in rose water and drank, after which the Emirs sat down to hold council and permitted the rest of the host to mount and ride forward leisurely, till they should make an end of their debate and overtake them. So the officers kissed the ground between their hands and mounting, rode onwards, preceded by the standards of war. When the grandees had finished their conference, they took horse and rejoined the host; and the Chamberlain approached the Wazir Dandan and said, ""I deem it well to ride on before you, and precede you, that I may get ready a place for the Sultan and notify him of your coming and of your choosing him as Sultan over the head of his brother Sharrkan."" ""Aright thou reckest,"" answered the Wazir Then the Chamberlain rose up in haste and Dandan also stood up to do him honour and brought him presents, which he conjured him to accept. In similar guise did all the Emirs and Grandees and Officers of State, bringing him gifts and calling down blessings on him and saying to him, ""Haply thou wilt mention our case to Sultan Zau al-Makan and speak to him to continue us in our dignities.""[FN#325] The Chamberlain promised all they required and bade his pages be ready to march, whereupon the Wazir Dandan sent with him tents and bade the tent pitchers set them up at a day's journey from the city. And they did his bidding. Then the Chamberlain mounted and rode forward, full of joy and saying to himself, ""How blessed is this gurney!"", and indeed his wife was exalted in his eyes, she and her brother Zau al-Makan. They made all haste over their wayfare, till they reached a place distant a day's journey from Baghdad, where the Chamberlain called a halt for rest, and bade his men alight and make ready a sitting place for the Sultan Zau al-Makan, son of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, while he rode forward with his Mamelukes and, alighting at a distance from Nuzhat al-Zaman's litter, commanded the eunuchs to ask leave of admission to the presence. They did so and she gave permission; whereupon he went in to her and conversed with her and her brother; and told them of the death of their father; and of Zau al-Makan, how the heads of the people had made him King over them in the stead of his sire; and he gave them joy of the kingdom. They both wept for their father and asked the manner of his being killed; but the Chamberlain answered, ""The news rests with the Wazir Dandan who will be here tomorrow leading all the host; and it only remaineth for thee, O King, to do what they counsel, since they have unanimously chosen thee Sultan; for if thou do not this, they will choose some one else and thou canst not be sure of thy life with another Sultan. Haply he will kill thee, or discord may befal between you twain and the kingdom pass out of the hands of both."" Zau al-Makan bowed his head awhile and then said, ""I accept this position;"" for indeed there was no refusing; and he was certified that the Chamberlain had counselled him well and wisely and set him on the right way. Then he added, ""O my uncle, how shall I do with my brother Sharrkan?"" ""O my son,"" replied the Chamberlain, ""thy brother will be Sultan of Damascus and thou Sultan of Baghdad; so take heart of grace and get ready thy case."" Zau al-Makan accepted this and the Chamberlain presented him with a suit of royal raiment and a dagger[FN#326] of state, which the Wazir Dandan had brought with him; then leaving him he bade the tent pitchers choose a spot of rising ground and set up thereon a spacious pavilion, wherein the Sultan might sit to receive the Emirs and Grandees. Moreover he ordered the kitcheners to cook rich viands and serve them and he commanded the water carriers to dispose the water troughs. They did as he bade them and presently arose a cloud of dust from the ground and spread till it walled the horizon round. After awhile, the dust dispersed and there appeared under it the army of Baghdad and Khorasan, a conquering host like the full tide sea.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Seventy-eighth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Chamberlain bade the tent pitchers set up a pavilion spacious enough to receive the subjects flocking to their Sultan, they planted a splendid Sháhmiyánah[FN#327] befitting Kings. And as they ended their labours behold, a dust cloud spired aloft and the breeze made it lift and beneath it showed a conquering host; and presently it appeared that this was the army of Baghdad and Khorasan preceded by the Wazir Dandan. And in it all rejoiced at the accession of the ""Light of the Place."" Now Zau al-Makan had donned robes of royal estate and girt himself with the sword of state: so the Chamberlain brought him a steed and he mounted surrounded by the Mamelukes and all the company from the tents on foot, to do him service, and he rode on until he came to the great pavilion, where he sat down and he laid the royal dagger across his thighs, whilst the Chamberlain stood in attendance on him and his armed slaves stationed themselves under the entrance awning of the Shahmiyanah, with drawn swords in their hands. Presently, up came the troops and the host and craved admission so the Chamberlain went in to Zau al-Makan and asked his leave whereupon he bade admit them, ten by ten. The Chamberlain acquainted them with the King's commands, to which they replied, ""We hear and we obey;"" and all drew up before the pavilion entrance. Then he took ten of them and carried them through the vestibule into the presence of Sultan Zau al-Makan, whom when they saw, they were awed; but he received them with most gracious kindness and promised them all good. So they gave him joy of his safe return and invoked Allah's blessings upon him after which they took the oath of fealty never to gainsay him in aught and they kissed ground before him and withdrew. Then other ten entered and he entreated them as he had entreated the ethers; and they ceased not to enter, ten by ten, till none was left but the Wazir Dandan. Lastly the Minister went in and kissed the ground before Zau al-Makan, who rose to meet him, saying, ""Welcome, O Wazir and sire sans peer! Verily, thine acts are those of a counsellor right dear, and judgement and foreseeing clear are in the hands of the Subtle of Lere."" Then bade he the Chamberlain forthwith go out and cause the tables to be spread and order all the troops thereto. So they came and ate and drank. Moreover the Sultan commanded his Wazir Dandan call a ten days' halt of the army, that he might be private with him and learn from him how and wherefore his father had been slain. The Wazir obeyed the commands of the Sultan with submission and wished him eternity of glory and said, ""This needs must be!"" He then repaired to the heart of the encampment and ordered the host to halt ten days. They did as he bade them and, moreover, he gave them leave to divert themselves and ordered that none of the lords in waiting should attend upon the King for service during the space of three days. Then the Wazir went to the Sultan and reported all to him, and Zau al-Makan waited until nightfall, when he went in to his sister Nuzhat al-Zaman and asked her, ""Dost thou know the cause of my father's murder or not?"" ""I have no knowledge of the cause,"" she answered, and drew a silken curtain before herself, whilst Zau al-Makan seated himself without the curtain and commanded the Wazir to the presence and, when he came, said to him, ""I desire thou relate to me in detail the cause of the killing of my sire, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman!"" ""Know then, O King,"" replied Dandan, ""that King Omar bin al- Nu'uman, when he returned to Baghdad from his chasing and hunting and entered the city, enquired for thee and thy sister, but could not find you and knew that you twain had gone on the Pilgrimage; whereat he was greatly grieved and much angered, and his breast was straitened and he abode thus half a year, seeking news of you from all who came and went but none could give him any tidings. Now while we were in attendance upon him one day, after a whole year had sped since ye were lost to his sight, lo! there came to us an ancient dame with signs of being a devotee, accompanied by five damsels, high bosomed virgins like moons, endowed with such beauty and loveliness as tongue faileth to describe; and, to crown their perfections of comeliness, they could read the Koran and were versed in various kinds of learning and in the histories of bygone peoples. Then that old woman sought audience of the King, and he bade admit her; whereupon she entered the presence and kissed the ground between his hands. I was then sitting by his side and he, seeing in her the signs of asceticism and devoutness, made her draw near and take seat hard by him. And when she had sat down she addressed him and said, 'Know, O King, that with me are five damsels, whose like no King among the Kings possesseth; for they are endowed with wit and beauty and loveliness and perfection. They read the Koran—and the Traditions and are skilled in all manner of learning and in the history of bygone races. They stand here between thy hands to do thee service, O King of the Age, and it is by trial that folk are prized or despised. 'Thy father, who hath found mercy;[FN#328] looked at the damsels and their favour pleased him; so he said to them, Let each and every of you make me hear something of what she knoweth anent the history of the folk of yore and of peoples long gone before!'—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Seventy-ninth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan said unto King Zau al-Makan, ""Thy father, who hath found mercy, glanced at the damsels and their favour pleased him and he said to them, 'Let each and every of you make me hear something of what she knoweth anent the history of the folk of yore and of peoples long gone before!' Thereupon one of them came forward and, kissing the ground before him, spake as follows[FN#329] 'Know, O King, that it behoveth one of good breeding to eschew impertinence and adorn himself with excellencies, and observe the Divine injunctions and avoid mortal sins; and to this he should apply himself with the assiduity of one who, if he stray therefrom, falleth into perdition; for the foundation of good breeding is virtuous behaviour. And know that the chief cause and reason of man's existence is the endeavour after life everlasting, and the right way thereto is the service of Allah. Wherefore it behoveth thee to deal beneficently with the people: and swerve not from this canon, for the mightier men are in dignity, the more their need of prudence and foresight; and indeed Monarchs need this more than the many, for the general cast themselves into affairs, without taking thought to the issue thereof. Be thou prodigal of thy life and thy good in the way of Allah, and know that, if an enemy dispute with thee, thou mayst dispute with him and refute him with proofs and be proof against him; but as for thy friend, there is none can judge between thee and him save righteousness and fair dealing. Choose, therefore, thy friend for thyself, after thou hast proved him. If he be of the brotherhood of futurity,[FN#330] let him be zealous in observing the externals of the Holy Law and versed in its inner meaning, as far as may be; and if he be of the brotherhood of the world, let him be free born, sincere, neither a fool nor a perverse, for the fool man is such that even his parents might well flee from him, and a liar cannot be a true friend. Indeed the word, Siddík[FN#331] ('friend') deriveth from Sidk ('truth') that welleth up from the bottom of the heart; and how can this be the case, when falsehood is manifest upon the tongue? And know, that the observance of the Law profiteth him who practiseth it: so love thy brother, if he be of this quality and do not cast him off, even if thou see in him that which irketh thee, for a friend is not I like a wife, whom one can divorce and re-marry: nay, his heart is like glass: once broken, it may not be mended. And Allah bless him who saith,

'Ware how thou hurtest man with hurt of heart; * 'Tis hard to win
             thee back the heart offended:
For hearts indeed, whence love is alien made, * Like broken glass
             may nevermore be mended.'

The maiden continued and concluded with pointing out to us what sages say, 'The best of brethren is he who is the most constant in good counsel; the best of action is that which is fairest in its consequence, and the best of praise is not that which is in the mouths of men. It is also said, 'It behoveth not the servant to neglect thanking Allah especially for two favours, health and reason.' Again it is said, 'Whoso honoureth himself, his lust is a light matter to him, and he who maketh much of his small troubles, Allah afflicteth him with the greater; he who obeyeth his own inclination neglecteth his duties and he who listeneth to the slanderer loseth the true friend. He who thinketh well of thee, do thou fulfill his thought of thee. He who exceedeth in contention sinneth, and he who against upright standeth not on ward, is not safe from the sword. Now will I tell thee somewhat of the duties of Kazis and judges. Know, O King, that no judgement serveth the cause of justice save it be given after proof positive, and it behoveth the judge to treat all people on the same level, to the intent that the great may not hunger for oppression nor the small despair of justice. Furthermore he should extract proof from the complainant and impose an oath upon the defendant; and mediation is admissible between Moslems, except it be a compromise sanctioning the unlawful or forbidding the lawful.[FN#332] If thou shalt have done aught during the day, of which thy reason is doubtful but thy good intention is proved, thou (O Kazi) shouldst revert to the right, for to do justice is a religious obligation and to return to that which is right is better than persistence in wrong. Then (O judge) thou shouldest study precedents and the law of the case and do equal justice between the suitors, withal fixing thine eyes upon the truth and committing thine affair to Allah (be He extolled and exalted!). And require thou proof of the complainant, and if he adduce evidence let him have due benefit of it; and if not, put the defendant to his oath; for this is the ordinance of Allah. Receive thou the testimony of competent Moslem witnesses, one against other, for Almighty Allah hath commanded judges to judge by externals, He Himself taking charge of the inner and secret things. It behoveth the judge also to avoid giving judge meet, whilst suffering from stress of pain or hunger,[FN#333] and that in his decisions between folk he seek the face of Allah Almighty for he whose intent is pure and who is at peace with himself, Allah shall guarantee him against what is between him and the people.' Quoth al-Zuhri,[FN#334] 'There are three things for which, if they be found in a Kazi, he should be deposed; namely, if he honour the base, if he love praise and if he fear dismissal. And Omar bin Abd al-Aziz once deposed a Kazi, who asked him, 'Why hast thou dismissed me? It hath reached me,' answered Omar, 'that thy converse is greater than thy condition.' It is said also that Iskandar[FN#335] said to his Kazi, 'I have invested thee with this function and committed to thee in it my soul and mine honour and my manliness; so do thou guard it with thy sense and thine understanding.' To his Cook he said, 'Thou art the Sultan of my body; so look thou tender it as thine own self.' To his Secretary he said, 'Thou art the controller of my wit: so do thou watch over me in what thou writest for me and from me.'"" Thereupon the first damsel backed out from the presence and a second damsel came forward.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Eightieth Night,

She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan said to Zau al-Makan, ""Thereupon the first damsel backed out from the presence and a second damsel came forward and, kissing the ground seven times before the King thy father, spake as follows, 'The sage Lukmán[FN#336] said to his son, 'There be three who are known only in three several cases; the merciful man is unknown save in time of wrath, the brave only in battle, and thy friend in time of need.' It is said that the oppressor shall be depress though by people praised, and that the oppress is at rest though by people blamed. Quoth Allah Almighty,[FN#337] 'Assuredly deem not that those who rejoice in what they have done, and who love to be praised for what they have not done, shall escape reckoning of punishment: indeed there is reserved for them a grievous penalty.' And he said[FN#338] (on whom be salvation and salutation!), 'Works are according to intention and to each man is attributed that which he intendeth.' He said also, 'In the body is a part which being sound the rest is sound, and which being unsound the whole is unsound.' And this is the heart. Now this heart is the most marvellous of what is in man, since it is that which ordereth his whole affair: If covetise stir in it, desire destroyeth him, and if affliction master it, anguish slayeth him; if anger rage in it, danger is hard upon him; if it be blest with contentment, he is safe from discontent; if fear surprise it, he is full of mourning; and if calamity overtake it, affliction betideth him. If a man gain the use of wealth, peradventure he is diverted thereby from the remembrance of his Lord; if poverty choke him his heart is distracted by woe, or if disquietude waste his heart, weakness causeth him to fall. Thus, in any case, nothing profiteth him but that he be mindful of Allah and occupy himself with gaining his livelihood in this world and securing his place in the next. It was asked of a certain sage, 'Who is the most ill conditioned of men?'; and he answered, 'The man whose lusts master his manhood and whose mind soareth over high, so that his knowledge dispreadeth and his excuse diminisheth; and how excellently saith the poet,

Freest am I of all mankind fro' meddling wight * Who, seeing
            others err, self error ne'er can sight:
Riches and talents are but loans to creature lent, * Each wears
            the cloak of that he bears in breast and sprite:
If by mistaken door attempt on aught thou make, * Thou shalt go
            wrong and if the door be right, go right!'

Continued the maiden, 'As for anecdotes of devotees, quoth Hisham bin Bashar, 'I asked Omar bin Ubayd, What is true piety?'; and he answered, 'The Apostle of Allah (to whom be salutation and salvation!) hath explained it when he sayeth, The pious is he who forgetteth not the grave nor calamity and who preferreth that which endureth to that which passeth away; who counteth not the morrow as of his days but reckoneth himself among the dead.' And it is related that Abu Zarr[FN#339] used to say, Want is dearer to me than wealth, and unheal is dearer to me than health.' Quoth one of the listeners, 'May Allah have mercy on Abu Zarr!'. For my part, I say, 'Whoso putteth his trust in the goodness of the election of Almighty Allah should be content with that condition which Allah hath chosen for him.' Quoth one of the Companions of the Prophet, 'Ibn Abi Aufa[FN#340] once prayed with us the dawn prayer. When he had done, he recited, 'O Thou Enwrapped!'[FN#341] till he came to where Allah saith, 'When there shall be a trumping on the trumpet,' and fell down dead. It is said that Sabit al-Banani wept till he well nigh lost his eyes. They brought him a man to medicine him who said to him, 'I will cure thee, provided thou obey my bidding' Asked Sabit, 'In what matter?' Quoth the leach, 'In that thou leave weeping!' 'What is the worth of mine eyes?', rejoined Sabit, 'if they do not weep?' Quoth a man to Mohammed bin Abdillah, 'Exhort thou me!'""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Eighty-first Night,

She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan said to Zau al-Makan, ""Thus spake the second hand maid to the King who hath found mercy, Omar bin al-Nu'uman. 'Quoth a man to Mohammed bin Abdillah, Exhort thou me!' 'I exhort thee,' replied he, 'to be a self ruler, an abstainer in this world, and in the next a greedy slave.' 'How so?' asked the other and Mohammed answered, 'The abstinent man in this world conquereth both the world that is and the world to come.' And quoth Ghaus bin Abdillah, 'There were two brothers among the sons of Israel, one of whom said to the other, 'What be the most perilous[FN#342] thing thou hast done?' Replied the brother, 'I once came upon a nest of young birds; so I took out one and threw it back into the nest; but among the chickens were some which drew apart from it. This is the most perilous thing I ever did; now what be the most perilous thing thou hast ever done?' He rejoined, 'When I arise for prayer I am fearful that it is only for the sake of the reward.' Now their father heard these words and exclaimed, 'O Allah, an say they sooth take them to Thyself!' It was declared by one of the wise men, 'Verily, these were of the most virtuous of children.' Quoth Sa'íd bin Jubayr,[FN#343] 'I was once in company with Fuzalah bin 'Ubaydand said to him, 'Exhort thou me!, Replied he, 'Bear in mind these two necessaries, Shun syntheism[FN#344] and harm not any of Allah's creatures.' And he repeated these two couplets,

'Be as thou wilt, for Allah still is bounteous Lord, * And care
            dispeller dread not therefore bane and ban
To two things only never draw thee nigh, nor give * Partner to
            Allah trouble to thy brother man.'
And how well saith the poet,

'An thou of pious works a store neglect * And after death meet
             one who did collect,
Thou shalt repent thou diddest not as he, * Nor madest ready as
             he did elect.'

Then the third damsel came forward, after the second had with drawn, and said, 'Of a truth, the chapter of piety is exceeding wide; but I will mention what occurreth to me thereof, concerning the pious of old. Quoth a certain holy man, 'I congratulate myself in death, though I am not assured of rest therein, save that I know death interveneth between a man and his works; so I hope for the doubling of good works and the docking off of ill works.' And Ita'a al Salami, when he had made an end of an exhortation, was wont to tremble and grieve and weep sore; and as they asked him why he did this he answered, 'I desire to enter upon a grave matter, and it is the standing up before Almighty Allah to do in accordance with my exhortation.' In similar guise Zayn al-Abidín,[FN#345] son of Al-Husayn, was wont to tremble when he rose to pray. Being asked the cause of this, he replied, 'Know ye not before whom I stand and whom I address?' It is said that there lived near Sufyán al-Thauri[FN#346] a blind man who, when the month of Ramazan came, went out with the folk to pray,[FN#347] but remained silent and hung back. Said Sufyan, 'On the Day of Resurrection he shall come with the people of the Koran and they will be distinguished by increase of honour from their fellows.' Quoth Sufyan, 'Were the soul established in the heart as befitteth, it would fly away for joy and pining for Paradise, and for grief and fear of hell-fire.' It is related also of Sufyan Al-Thauri that he said, 'To look upon the face of a tyrant is a sin.' Then the third damsel retired and came for ward the fourth, who said, 'Here am I to treat of sundry traditions of pious men which suggest themselves to me. It is related that Bishr Barefoot[FN#348] said, 'I once heard Khálid say, 'Beware of secret polytheism.' I asked, 'What may secret polytheism be?'; and he answered, 'When one of you in praying prolong his inclinations and prostrations till a cause of impurity[FN#349] come upon him.' And one of the sages said, 'Doing works of weal expiateth what is ill.' Quoth Ibrahim,[FN#350] 'I supplicated Bishr Barefoot to acquaint me with some theological mysteries; but he said, 'O my son, this knowledge it behoveth us not to teach to every one; of every hundred five, even as the legal alms upon money.' Said Ibrahim, 'I thought his reply excellent and approved of it and while I was praying behold, Bishr was also praying: so I stood behind him[FN#351] making the prayer bow till the Mu'ezzin called his call. Then rose a man of tattered appearance and said, O folk, beware of a truth which bringeth unweal, for there is no harm in a lie bringing weal,[FN#352] and in time of need no choice we heed: speech booteth not in the absence of good qualities even as silence hurteth not in the presence of good. Presently I saw Bishr drop a danik,[FN#353] so I picked it up and exchanged it for a dirham which I gave him. Quoth he, 'I will not take it.' Quoth I, 'It is perfectly lawful change'; but he rejoined 'I cannot take in exchange the riches of the present world for those of the future world.' It is related also that Bishr Barefoot's sister once went to Ahmad bin Hanbal""[FN#354]—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Eighty-second Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan continued to bespeak Zau al-Makan on this wise, ""And quoth the maiden to thy father, 'Bishr Barefoot's sister once went to Ahmad bin Hanbal and said to him, 'O Imam of the Faith, we are a family that spin thread by night and work for our living by day; and oftentimes the cressets of the watch of Baghdad pass by and we on the roof spinning by their light. Is this forbidden to us?' Asked Ahmad:'Who are thou?' 'I am the sister of Bishr Barefoot,' answered she. Rejoined the Iman, 'O household of Bishr, I shall never cease to drink full draughts of piety from your hearts.' Quoth one of the sages, 'When Allah willeth well to His servant He openeth upon him the gate of action.' Málik bin Dinár,[FN#355] when he passed through the bazar and saw aught he desired, was wont to say, 'O soul, take patience, for I will not accord to thee what thou desirest.' He said also (Allah accept him!), 'The salvation of the soul lies in resistance to it and its damnation in submission to it.' Quoth Mansúr bin Ammár,[FN#356] 'I made a pilgrimage and was faring Meccahwards by way of Cufa, and the night was overcast, when I heard a voice crying out from the deeps of the darkness saying, 'O Allah, I swear by Thy Greatness and Thy Glory, I meant not through my disobedience to transgress against Thee; for indeed I am not ignorant of Thee; but my fault is one Thou didst foreordain to me from eternity without beginning;[FN#357] so do Thou pardon my transgression, for indeed I disobeyed Thee of my ignorance!' When he had made an end of his prayer he recited aloud the verse, 'O true believers, save your souls and those of your families from the fire whose fuel is men and stones.'[FN#358] Then I heard a fall, but not knowing what it was I passed on. When the morning morrowed, as we went our way, behold, we fell in with a funeral train, followed by an old woman whose strength had left her. I asked her of the dead, and she answered, 'This is the funeral of a man who passed by us yesterday whilst my son was standing at prayer and after his prayers he recited a verse from the Book of Allah Almighty when the man's gall bladder burst and he fell dead.' Therewith the fourth damsel retired and the fifth came forward and said, 'I here will also repeat what occurreth to me regarding the acts of devotees in olden time. Maslamah bin Dinár used to say, 'By making sound the secret thoughts, sins great and small are covered'; and, 'when the servant of Allah is resolved to leave sinning, victory cometh to him.' Also quoth he, 'Every worldly good which doth not draw one nearer to Allah is a calamity, for a little of this world distracteth from a mickle of the world to come and a mickle of the present maketh thee forget the whole of the future.' It was asked of Abú Házim,[FN#359] 'Who is the most prosperous of men?'; and he answered, 'Whoso spendeth his life in submission to Allah.' The other enquired, 'And who is the most foolish of mankind?' 'Whoso selleth his future for the worldly goods of others,' replied Abu Hazim. It is reported of Moses[FN#360] (on whom be peace!) that when he came to the waters of Midian he exclaimed, 'O Lord, verily I stand in need of the good which thou shalt send down to me.'[FN#361] And he asked of his Lord and not of his folk. There came two damsels and he drew water for them both and allowed not the shepherds to draw first. When the twain returned, they informed their father Shu'ayb (on whom be peace!) who said, 'Haply, he is hungry,' adding to one of them, 'Go back to him and bid him hither.' Now when she came to Moses, she veiled her face and said, 'My father biddeth thee to him that he may pay thee thy wage for having drawn water for us.' Moses was averse to this and was not willing to follow her. Now she was a woman large in the back parts, and the wind blowing upon her garment[FN#362] covered the hinder cheeks to Moses; which when Moses saw, he lowered his eyes and said to her, 'Get thee behind while I walk in front.' So she followed him till he entered the house of Shu'ayb where supper was ready.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Eighty-third Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan continued to Zau al-Makan, ""Now, quoth the fifth damsel to thy sire, 'When Moses (on whom be peace!) entered the home of Shu'ayb where supper was ready, Shu'ayb said to him, 'O Moses, I desire to pay thee thy wage for having drawn water for these two.' But Moses answered, 'I am of a household which selleth nothing of the fashion of the next world[FN#363] for what is on earth of gold and silver.' Then quoth Shu'ayb, 'O youth! nevertheless thou art my guest, and it is my wont and that of my forbears to honour the guest by setting food before him.' So Moses sat down and ate. Then Shu'ayb hired Moses for eight pilgrimages, that is to say, eight years, and made his wage marriage with one of his two daughters, and Moses' service to him was to stand for her dowry. As saith the Holy Writ of him, 'Verily I will give thee one of these my two daughters in marriage, on condition that thou serve me for hire eight pilgrimages: and if thou fulfil ten years, it is in thine own breast; for I seek not to impose a hardship on thee.'[FN#364] A certain man once said to one of his friends whom he had not met for many days, 'Thou hast made me desolate, for that I have not seen thee this long while.' Quoth the other, 'I have been distracted from thee by Ibn Shiháb: dost thou know him?' Quoth his friend, 'Yes, he hath been my neighbour these thirty years, but I have never spoken to him.' He replied, 'Verily thou forgettest Allah in forgetting—thy neighbour! If thou lovedst Allah thou wouldst love thy neighbour. Knowest thou not that a neighbour hath a claim upon his neighbour,[FN#365] even as the right of kith and kin?' Said Huzayfah, 'We entered Meccah with Ibráhím bin Adham, and Shakík al-Balkhí was also making a pilgrimage that year. Now we met whilst circumambulating the Ka'abah and Ibrahim said to Shakik, 'What is your fashion in your country?' Replied Shakik, 'When we are blest with our daily bread we eat, and when we hunger we take patience.' 'This wise,' said Ibrahim, 'do the dogs of Balkh; but we, when blest with plenty, do honour to Allah and when an hungered we thank Him.' And Shakik seated himself before Ibrahim and said to him, 'Thou art my master.' Also said Mohammed bin Imrán, 'A man once asked of Hátim the Deaf[FN#366] 'What maketh thee to trust in Allah?' 'Two things,' answered he, 'I know that none save myself shall eat my daily bread, so my heart is at rest as to that; and I know that I was not created without the knowledge of Allah, and am abashed before Him.' Then the fifth damsel retired and the ancient dame came forward and, kissing the ground before thy father nine times, said, 'Thou hast heard, O King, what these all have spoken on the subject of piety; and I will follow their example in relating what hath reached me of the famous men of past times. It is said that the Imam al-Sháfi'í departed the night into three portions, the first for study, the second for sleep and the third for prayer. The Imam Abú Hanífah[FN#367] was wont also to pass half the night in prayer. One

day a man pointed him out to another, as he walked by and remarked, 'Yonder man watcheth the whole night.' When he heard this Abu Hanifah said, 'I was abashed before Allah to hear myself praised for what was not in me'; so after this he used to watch the whole night. And one of the Sages hath said,

'Who seeketh for pearl in the Deep dives deep; * Who on high would hie robs his night of sleep.'

Al-Rabí a relates that Al-Shafi'i used to recite the whole Koran seventy times during the month of Ramazan, and that in his daily prayers. Quoth Al-Shafi'i (Allah accept him!), 'During ten years I never ate my fill of barley bread, for fullness hardeneth the heart and deadeneth the wit and induceth sleep and enfeebleth one from standing up to pray.'[FN#368] It is reported of Abdullah bin Mohammed al-Sakrá that he said, 'I was once talking with Omar and he observed to me, 'Never saw I a more God fearing or eloquent man than Mohammed bin Idris al-Shafi'i.' It so happened I went out one day with Al-Háris bin Labíb al-Saffár, who was a disciple of Al-Muzani[FN#369] and had a fine voice and he read the saying of the Almighty, 'This shall be a day whereon they shall not speak to any purpose, nor shall they be permitted to excuse themselves.'[FN#370] I saw Al-Shafi'i's colour change; his skin shuddered with horripilation, he was violently moved and he fell down in a fainting fit When he revived he said, 'I take refuge with Allah from the stead of the liars and the lot of the negligent! O Allah, before whom the hearts of the wise abase themselves, O Allah, of Thy bene ficence accord to me the remission of my sins, adorn me with the curtain of Thy protection and pardon me my shortcomings, by the magnanimity of Thy Being!' Then I rose and went away. Quoth one of the pious, 'When I entered Baghdad, Al-Shafi'i was there. So I sat down on the river bank to make the ablution before prayer; and behold, there passed me one who said, 'O youth, make thy Wuzu-ablution well and Allah will make it well for thee in this world and in the next.' I turned and lo! there was a man behind whom came a company of people. So I hastened to finish my ablution and followed him. Presently, he turned and asked me, 'Say, dost thou want aught?' 'Yes,' answered I, 'I desire that thou teach me somewhat of that which Allah Almighty hath taught thee.' He said, 'Know then that whoso believeth in Allah shall be saved, and whoso jealously loveth his faith shall be delivered from destruction, and whoso practiseth abstinence in this world, his eyes shall be solaced on the morrow of death. Shall I tell thee any more?' I replied, 'Assuredly;' and he continued, 'Be thou of the world that is, heedless; and of the world to come, greediest. Be truthful in all thy dealings, and thou shalt be saved with the Salvationists.' Then he went on and I asked about him and was told that he was the Imam Al-Shafi'i. Al-Shafi'i was wont to remark, 'I love to see folk profit by this learning of mine, on condition that nothing of it be attributed to me.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Eighty-fourth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan continued to Zau al-Makan, ""The old woman bespake thy sire, saying, 'The Imam Al-Shafi'i was wont to remark, I love to see folk profit by this learning of mine on condition that nothing of it be attributed to me.' He also said, 'I never disputed with any one, but I would that Almighty Allah should give him the knowledge of the Truth and aid him to dispread it: nor did I ever dispute with anyone at all but for the showing forth of the Truth, and I reck not whether Allah manifest it by my tongue or by His.' He said also (whom Allah accept!), 'If thou fear to grow conceited of thy lore, then bethink thee Whose grace thou seekest and for what good thou yearnest and what punishment thou dreadest.' It was told to Abu Hanífah that the Commander of the Faithful, Abú Ja'afar al-Mansúr, had appointed him Kazi and ordered him a salary of ten thousand dirhams; but he would not accept of this; and, when the day came on which the money was to be paid him, he prayed the dawn prayer, then covered his head with his robe—and spoke not. When the Caliph's messenger came with the money, he went in to the Imam and accosted him, but he would not speak to him. So the messenger said, 'Verily this money is lawfully thine.' 'I know that it is lawfully mine,' replied he: 'but I abhor that the love of tyrants get a hold upon my heart.'[FN#371] Asked the other, 'If thou go in to them canst thou not guard thyself from loving them?' Answered Abu Hanifah, 'Can I look to enter the sea without my clothes being wet?' Another of Al-Shafi'i's sayings (Allah accept him!) is,

'Oh soul of me, an thou accept my rede, * Thou shalt be wealthy
           and of grace entire:
Cast off ambitious hopes and vain desires, * How many a death was
            done by vain desire!'

Among the sayings of Sufyán al-Thaurí, with which he admonished Ali bin al-Hasan al-Salami was, 'Be thou a man of truth and 'ware lies and treachery and hypocrisy and pride. Be not indebted save to Him who is merciful to His debtors; and let thine associate be one who shall dissociate thee from the world. Be ever mindful of death and be constant in craving pardon of Allah and in beseeching of Allah peace for what remaineth of thy life. Counsel every True Believer, when he asketh thee concerning the things of his faith; and beware of betraying a Believer, for whoso betrayeth a Believer, betrayeth Allah and His Apostle. Avoid dissensions and litigation; and leave that which causeth doubt in thee for things which breed no doubt:[FN#372] so shalt thou be at peace. Enjoin beneficence and forbid malevolence: so shalt thou be loved of Allah. Adorn thine inner man and Allah shall adorn thine outer man. Accept the excuse of him who excuseth self to thee and hate not any one of the Moslems. Draw near unto those who withdraw from thee and excuse those that misuse thee: so shalt thou be the friend of the Prophets. Let thine affairs, both public and private, be in Allah's charge, and fear Him with the fear of one who knoweth he is dead and who fareth towards Resurrection and Judgement stead between the hands of the Lord of Dread; and remember that to one of two houses thou art sped, either for Heavens eterne or to the Hell fires that burn.' Thereupon the old woman sat down beside the damsels. Now when thy father, who hath found mercy, heard their discourse, he knew that they were the most accomplished of the people of their time; and, seeing their beauty and loveliness and the extent of their wisdom and lore, he showed them all favour. Moreover, he turned to the ancient dame and treated her with honour, and set apart for her and her damsels the palace which had lodged Princess Abrizah, daughter of the King of Greece, to which he bade carry all the luxuries they needed. They abode with him ten days and the old woman abode with them; and, whenever the King visited them, he found her absorbed in prayer, watching by night and fasting by day; whereby love of her took hold upon his heart and he said to me, 'O Wazir, verily this old woman is of the pious, and awe of her is strong in my heart.' Now on the eleventh day, the King visited her, that he might pay her the price of the damsels; but she said to him, 'O King, know that the price of these maidens surpasseth the competence of men; indeed I seek not for them either gold or silver or jewels, be it little or much.' Now when thy father heard these words he wondered and asked her, 'O my lady and what is their price?'; whereto she answered, 'I will not sill them to thee save on condition that thou fast, watching by night a whole month, and abstaining by day, all for the love of Allah Almighty; and, if thou do this, they are thy property to use in thy palace as thou please.' So the King wondered at the perfection of her rectitude and piety and abnegation; she was magnified in his eyes and he said, 'Allah make this pious woman to profit us!' Then he agreed with her to fast for a month as she had stipulated, and she said to him, 'I will help thee with the prayers I pray for thee and now bring me a gugglet of water.' They brought one and she took it and recited over it and muttered spells, and sat for an hour speaking in speech no one understood or knew aught thereof. Lastly she covered it with a cloth and, sealing it with her signet ring, gave it to thy sire, saying, 'When thou hast fasted the first ten days, break thy fast on the eleventh night with what is in this gugglet, for it will root out the love of the world from thy heart and fill it with light and faith. As for me, tomorrow I will go forth to my brethren, the Invisible[FN#373] Controuls, for I yearn after them, and I will return to thee when the first ten days are past. Thy father took the gugglet and arose and set it apart in a closet of his palace, then locked the door and put the key in his pocket. Next day the King fasted and the old woman went her ways.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Eighty-fifth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan thus continued to Zau al-Makan, ""Now when came the day for the Sultan's fast, the old woman went her ways. And after he had accomplished the ten days thereof, on the eleventh he opened the gugglet and drank what was therein and found it cordial to his stomach. Within the second ten days of the month the old woman returned, bringing sweetmeats wrapped in a green leaf, like no leaf of known tree. She went in to thy sire and saluted him; and, when he saw her, he rose to her saying, 'Welcome, O pious lady!' 'O King,' quoth she, 'the Invisible Controuls salute thee, for I told them of thee, and they rejoiced in thee and have sent thee their Halwá,[FN#374] which is of the sweetmeats of the other world. Do thou break thy fast on it at the end of the day.' The King rejoiced at this with great joy, and exclaimed, 'Praised be Allah, who hath given me brethren of the Invisible World!' Thereupon he thanked the ancient dame and kissed her hands; and he honoured her and the damsels with exceeding honour. She went forth for the twenty days of thy father's fast at the end of which time she came to him and said, 'Know, O King, that I told the Invisible Controuls of the love which is between me and thee, and informed them how I had left the maidens with thee, and they were glad that the damsels should belong to a King like thee; for they were wont, when they saw them, to be strenuous in offering on their behalf prayers and petitions ever granted. So I would fain carry them to the Invisible Controuls that they may benefit by the breath of their favour, and peradventure, they shall not return to thee without some treasure of the treasures of the earth, that thou, after completing thy fast, mayst occupy thyself with their raiment and help thyself by the money they shall bring thee, to the extent of thy desires.' When thy sire heard her words, he thanked her for them and said, 'Except that I fear to cross thee, I would not accept the treasure or aught else; but when wilt thou set out with them?' Replied she, 'On the seven and twentieth night; and I will bring them back to thee at the head of the month, by which time thou wilt have accomplished thy fast and they will have had their courses and be free from impurity; and they shall become thine and be at thy disposal. By Allah, each damsel of them is worth many times thy kingdom!' He said, 'I know it, O pious lady!' Then quoth the old woman, 'There is no help but that thou send with them someone in thy palace who is dear to thee, that she may find solace and seek a blessing of the Invisible Controuls.' Quoth he, 'I have a Greek slave called Sophia, by whom I have been blessed with two children, a girl and a boy; but they were lost; years ago. Take her with thee that she may get the blessing'""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Eighty-sixth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan continued to Zau al-Makan, ""Quoth thy sire to the ancient woman when she demanded the handmaids of him, 'I have a Greek slave called Sophia, by whom I have been blest with two children, a girl and a boy, but they were lost years ago; so take her with thee, haply she may get the benediction and, belike, the Invisible Controuls will sue Allah for her that her two children may be restored to her.' 'Thou hast said well,' replied she; 'for that indeed was her grievousest want.' Thy sire gave not over finishing his fast till the old woman said to him, 'O my son, I am going to the Invisible Controuls; so bring me Sophia.' Accordingly, he summoned her and she came forthright, and he delivered her to the old woman who mixed her up with the other damsels. Then she went in to her chamber and bringing out a sealed cup, presented it to the Sultan saying, 'On the thirtieth day, do thou repair to the Hammam and when thou comest out, enter one of the closets in thy palace and drink what is in this cup. Then sleep, and thou shalt attain what thou seekest, and peace be with thee'! Thereat the King was glad and thanked her and kissed her hands. Quoth she, 'I commend thee to Allah's care;' whereat quoth he, 'And when shall I see thee again, O pious lady? In very sooth I love not to part with thee.' Then she called down blessings on him and departed with the five damsels and the Queen; whilst the King fasted after her departure other three days, till the month ended, when he arose and went to the Hammam and coming out shut himself up in a closet of his palace, commanding that none should go in to him. There, after making fast the door, he drank what was in the cup and lay down to sleep; and we sat awaiting him till the end of the day, but he did not come out and we said, 'Perchance he is tired with the bath and with watching by night and fasting by day; wherefore he sleepeth.' So we waited till next day; but still he did not come forth. Then we stood at the closet door and cried aloud so haply he might awake and ask what was the matter. But nothing came of that; so at last we lifted up the door;[FN#375] and, going in, found him dead, with his flesh torn into strips and bits and his bones broken.[FN#376] When we saw him in this condition it was grievous to us, and we took up the cup and found within its cover a piece of paper whereon was inscribed, 'Whoso doeth evil leaveth no regrets, and this be the reward of him who playeth traitor with the daughters of Kings and who debaucheth them; and we make known to all who fall upon this scroll that Sharrkan, when he came to our country, seduced our Queen Abrizah; nor did that suffice him but he must needs take her from us and bring her to you. Then he[FN#377] sent her away in company of a black slave who slew her, and we found her lying dead on the desert sward and thrown out to wild beasts. This be no kingly deed, and he who did this is requited with naught but what he merited. So do ye suspect none of having killed him, for no one slew him but the cunning witch, whose name is Zat al-Dawahi. And behold, I have taken the King's wife, Sophia, and have carried her to her father, Afridun King of Constantinople. Moreover, there is no help for it but that we wage war upon you and kill you and take your country from you, and ye shall be cut off even to the last man, nor shall a living soul be spared by Death nor one who bloweth fire with his breath, save he who Cross and Belt[FN#378] worshippeth.' When we read this paper, we knew that the ancient woman had beguiled us and carried out her plot against us: whereupon we cried aloud and buffeted our faces and wept sore when weeping availed us naught. And the troops fell out as to whom they should make Sultan; some would have thee, and others would have thy brother Sharrkan; and we ceased not to dispute about this for the space of a month, at the end of which certain of us drew together and agreed to repair to thy brother Sharrkan: so we set out and journeyed on till we fell in with thee. And such is the manner of the death of Sultan Omar bin al-Nu'uman!"" Now when the Wazir Dandan had made an end of his story, Zau al- Makan and his sister, Nuzhat al-Zaman wept; and the Chamberlain, who wept also, said to Zau al-Makan, ""O King, weeping will avail thee naught; nor shall aught profit thee but that thou harden thy heart and strengthen thy stress and establish thy sovranty; for verily whoso leaveth the like of thee is not dead."" Thereupon Zau al-Makan gave over his weeping and caused his throne to be set up without the pavilion, and then commanded the army to pass in review order before him. And the Chamberlain sat by his side and all the armour-bearers[FN#379] behind him, whilst the Wazir Dandan and the rest of the Emirs and Grandees stood each in his individual stead. Then quoth King Zau al-Makan to the Minister Dandan, ""Inform me concerning my sire's treasures;"" and he replied, ""I hear and I obey;"" and gave him to know of the late King's hoards and monies, and what was in the treasury of amassed wealth and jewels, and acquainted him with other precious things. So Zau al-Makan opened his hand to the army, and gave a sumptuous robe of honour to the Wazir Dandan, saying, ""Thou continues"" in office. Whereupon Dandan kissed the ground before him and wished him long life. Then he bestowed dresses on the Emirs, after which he said to the Chamberlain, ""Bring out before me the tribute of Damascus that is with thee."" So he was shown the chests of money and rarities and jewels, when he took them and parted them all amongst the troops,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Eighty-seventh Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Zau al- Makan ordered the Chamberlain to bring out before him what he had brought of the tribute of Damascus; and, when he was shown the chests of money and rarities and jewels, he took them and parted them all amongst the troops, till nothing was left. And the Emirs kissed the ground before him and wished him long life, saying, ""Never saw we a King, who gave the like of these gifts."" Then all went away to their tents and when it was morning he gave orders for marching. So they marched for three days, till, on the fourth day, they drew near to Baghdad. When they entered the city, they found it decorated, and Zau al-Makan, the Sultan, went up to his father's palace and sat down on the throne, whilst the Emirs of the army and the Wazir Dandan and the Chamberlain of Damascus stood between his hands. Then he bade his private secretary write a writ to his brother Sharrkan, acquainting him with all that had passed, from first to last, and he concluded, ""As soon as thou hast read this letter, make ready thine affair and join us with thine army, that we may turn to Holy War upon the Infidels and take man bote for our father and wipe out the stain upon our honour."" Then he folded the letter and sealed it with his seal ring and said to the Minister Dandan, ""None shall carry this letter but thou; and it behoveth thee speak my brother fair and say to him, 'If thou have a mind to thy father's kingdom, it is thine, and thy brother shall be Viceroy for thee in Damascus; for to this effect am I instructed by him.'"" So the Wazir went down from before him and made ready for his march. Then Zau al-Makan bade set apart a magnificent house for the Fireman and furnished it with the best of furniture and long is the tale of that Fireman.[FN#380] Presently Zau al-Makan went out chasing and hunting and, as he was returning to Baghdad, one of the Emirs presented him with blood horses and with beauteous handmaids whose description the tongue evades. One of the damsels pleased him: so he went in unto her and knew her that night, and she conceived by him forthright. After a while, the Wazir Dandan returned from his journey, bringing him news of his brother Sharrkan and that he was then on his way to him, and said, ""It were fitting thou go forth to meet him."" Zau al- Makan replied, ""I hear and I consent;"" and riding forth with his Grandees a day's journey from Baghdad, he pitched his pavilions there awaiting his brother. Next morning appeared King Sharrkan amid the army of Syria, a horseman of might, a lion fierce in fight, a prow and doughty knight. As the squadrons drew nigh and the dust clouds came hard by and the troops rode up with banners on high, Zau al-Makan and those with him pushed forward to meet Sharrkan and his men; and when Zau al-Makan saw his brother, he desired to dismount, but Sharrkan conjured him not to do on this wise, and himself footed it, and walked a few paces towards him.[FN#381] As soon as he reached Zau al-Makan, the new Sultan threw himself upon him, and Sharrkan embraced him and wept with great weeping and the twain condoled with each other. Then they mounted and rode onward, they and their troops, till they reached Baghdad, where they alighted and went up to the royal palace and there they passed that night, and when next morning came, Zau al- Makan went forth and bade summon the troops from all parts, and proclaimed a Holy War and a Razzia.[FN#382] They then awaited the coming of the levies from each quarter of the kingdom, and every one who came they entreated with honour and promised him all manner of good; till in so doing a full month had sped, and the fighting men flocked to them in a continuous body. Then Sharrkan said to Zau al-Makan, ""O my brother, tell me thy history."" So he told him all that had befallen him from first to last, including the benevolent dealing of the Fireman with him. Asked Sharrkan, 'Hast thou requited his kindness?""; and he answered, ""O my brother! I have not rewarded him as yet, but Inshallah! I will recompense him whenas I return from this raid""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Eighty-eighth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkan asked his brother Zau al-Makan, ""Hast thou requited the Fireman for his kindness?""; and he answered, ""O my brother, I have not rewarded him as yet, but Inshallah! I will recompense him whenas I return from this raid and find time so to do."" Therewith Sharrkan was certified that his sister, Nuzhat al-Zaman, had told him the whole truth; but he concealed what had passed between them and offered his salutation to her by her husband the Chamberlain. She sent him back her greeting, calling down blessings on him and enquiring after her daughter Kuzia-Fakan, to which he replied that the maiden was well and in the best of health and safety. Where upon she praised Almighty Allah and gave him thanks. Then Sharrkan went to his brother to take counsel with him for departure; and Zau al-Makan said, ""O my brother, as soon as the army is complete and the Arabs have come in from all parts, we will march forth."" So he bade make ready the commissariat and prepare munitions of war and went in to his wife, who was now five months gone with child; and he put under her astrologers and mathematicians, to whom he appointed stipends and allowances. Then he set out three months after the arrival of the army of Syria, and as soon as the Arabs were come in and the troops were assembled from all directions; and, as he fared forth, he was followed by the warriors and the united host. Now the name of the General of the Daylam army was Rustam and that of the General of the army of the Turks[FN#383] Bahram. And Zau al- Makan marched in mid host and on his right was his brother Sharrkan, and on his left the Chamberlain his brother-in-law. So the squadrons broke up and pushed forward and the battalions and companies filed past in battle array, till the whole army was in motion. They ceased not to fare on for the space of a month, and each body dismounted at its own ground and there rested every week three days (for the host was great); and they advanced in this order till they came to the country of the Greeks. Then the people of the villages and hamlets and the poorer sort took fright at them and fled to Constantinople. But when King Afridun heard the tidings he arose and betook himself to Zat al-Dawahi, the same who had contrived the stratagem, and had travelled to Baghdad and had slain King Omar bin Al-Nu'uman; and who after carrying off her slaves and Queen Sophia, had returned with them all to her native land. Now when she had been restored to her son, the King of Greece, and felt herself safe, she said to King Hardub, ""Cool thine eyes; for I have avenged by blood the shame of thy daughter Abrizah, and have killed Omar bin al-Nu'uman and have brought back Sophia. So now let us go to the King of Constantinople and carry to him his daughter and acquaint him with what hath happened, that all of us be on guard and prepare our forces; and I will fare with thee to King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople, for I opine that the Moslems will not await our attack."" Said Hardub, ""Tarry thou till they draw near our country, that we may make us ready meantime and assemble our power."" Accordingly they took to levying their forces and preparing for war, and, when the news of the Moslems' advance reached them, they were prepared for defence; and Zat al Dawahi had preceded them. Now when she and her son arrived at Constantinople, the King of Kings, Afridun, hearing of the approach of Hardub, King of the Greeks, came forth to meet him and asked how it was with him and the cause of his visit. So Hardub acquainted him with the cunning doings of his mother, Zat al-Dawahi, how she had slain the Moslem King and recovered from him Queen Sophia, and had said, ""The Moslems have assembled their forces and are on their way to attack us, wherefore it behoveth that we two join hands in single band and meet them."" Now King Afridun rejoiced in the return of his daughter and the killing of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman; and he sent to all countries seeking succour and acquainting the folk with the cause of slaying the Moslem King. So the Nazarene troops flocked to him and three months were not past ere the army of the Greeks was complete, besides which there joined themselves to him Franks from all their lands, French, Germans[FN#384] and Ragusans,[FN#385] with men of Zara,[FN#386] Venetians, Genoese, and all the hosts of the Yellow Faces[FN#387]; and, when the gathering was at its full, earth was straitened on them by reason of their multitude. Then Afridun, the Great King, ordered a march; so they set out and ceased not to defile through the city for ten days. They fared on till they reached the Wady highs Al-Nu'uman, a broad sided vale hard by the Salt Sea, where they halted three days; and on the fourth they were about to set out again, when news came that the army of Al-Islam on them press, and the defenders of the faith of Mohammed, of Men the Best. So they halted in it other three days, and on the eighth they espied a dust cloud which towered till it walled the whole land; nor was an hour of the day past ere that dust began to drift and was torn to shreds in the lift, and pierced through its shades the starry radiance of lance and the white levee of blades. Presently there appeared beneath it the banners Islamitan and the ensigns Mahometan; the horsemen urged forward, like the letting loose of seas that surged, clad in mail, as they were mackerel-back clouds which the moon enveil; whereupon the two hosts clashed, like two torrents on each other dashed. Eyes fell upon eyes; and the first to seek combat singular was the Wazir Dandan, he and the army of Syria, numbering thirty thousand bridles, and with him were the General of the Turks, and the General of Daylam, Rustam and Bahram, amid twenty thousand horse, behind whom came the men from the shores of the Salt Sea, clad in iron mail, as they were full moons that past through a night o'ercast. Then the Nazarene host called out on Jesus and Mary, and the defiled[FN#388] Cross and they heaped themselves upon the Wazir Dandan and those with him of the Syrian host. Now all this was in pursuance of a stratagem devised by that ancient woman Zat al-Dawahi; for, before his departure, King Afridun had gone in to her and asked her, ""How shall I do and what plan shall I pursue?; it is thou hast caused this great distress to us;"" and she had answered, ""O great King and mighty Cohen![FN#389] I will teach thee a trick would baffle Iblis himself, though he summon to his assistance all his grisly hosts.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Eighty-ninth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, all this was a stratagem of the ancient woman, for that the King before his departure had gone to her and asked, ""How shall I do and what plan shall I pursue? it is thou hast caused this great distress to us!"" And she had answered, ""O great King and mighty Cohen, I will teach thee a trick would baffle the Devil himself though he summon to his assistance all his grisly hosts. It is that thou send fifty thousand men going down in ships, and sailing over the sea to the Mountain of Smoke; and there let them land and stir not till {he standards of Al-Islam come upon thee, when do thou up and at them. Then bid the troops from the seaward sally out upon the Moslems and take them in rear, whilst we confront them from the landward. So not one of them shall escape, and our sorrows shall tease and peace abide with us."" Now the counsel of this ancient woman commended itself to King Afridun, and he replied, ""Right is the recking thou reckest, O Princess of wits and recourse of Kings and Cohens warring for their blood wit!"" So when the army of Al-Islam came upon them in chat valley, before they knew of it the flames began to burn up the tents and the swords in men's bodies to make rents. Then hurried up the army of Baghdad and Khorasan who numbered one hundred and twenty thousand horse, with Zau al-Makan in the front of war. When the host of the Infidels that lay by the sea saw them, they sallied out against them and followed in their tracks; and when Zau al- Makan espied this he cried out to his men, ""Turn back to the Infidels, O People of the Chosen Apostle, and slay those who deny and hate the authority of the Compassionating, the Compassionate!"" So they turned and fought with the Christians. Then Sharrkan marched up with another corps of the Moslem host, some hundred thousand men, whilst the Infidels numbered nigh upon a thousand and six hundred thousand men. When the Moslems were united, their hearts were strengthened and they cried out, saying, ""Verily Allah hath pro mised us victory, and to the Infidels hath assigned defeat."" And they clashed together with sword and spear. Now Sharrkan tare through rank and row and raged among the masses of the foe, fighting so fierce a fight as to make children grey grow; nor did he cease tourneying among the infidel horde and working havoc among them with the keen edged sword, shouting ""Allaho Akbar!"" (Allah is Most Great) till he drove back the host to the coast. Then failed the force of the foe and Allah gave victory to the faith of Al-Islam, and folk fought folk, drunken without strong drink till they slew of the Infidels in this affair forty and five thousand, while of the Moslems but three thousand and five hundred fell. Moreover, the Lion of the Faith, King Sharrkan, and his brother, Zau al-Makan, slept not that night, but occupied themselves with congratulating their braves and with looking to the wounded and with assuring the army of victory and salvation and promise of reward in the world to come. Thus far concerning the Moslem; but as regards King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople and Sovran of Roum, and Zat Al-Dawahi, they assembled the Emirs of the host and said to them, ""Verily, we had worked our will and solaced our hearts, but our over confidence in our numbers, and that only, defeated us."" Then quoth to them the ancient one, the Lady of Calamities, ""In very sooth nought shall profit you, except ye draw you nigh unto the Messiah and put your trust in the True Belief, for, by the virtue of the Messiah, the whole strength of the Moslem host lieth in that Satan, King Sharrkan."" ""Tomorrow,"" said King Afridun, ""I have resolved to draw up in battle array and to send out against them that redoubtable cavalier, Lúká bin Shamlút; for if King Sharrkan come forth as a champion to fight single handed, our man will slay him and will slay the other Moslem Knights, till not one is left. And I purpose this night to sacre you all with the Holy Incense."" When the Emirs heard these words they kissed the ground before him. Now the incense which he designated was the excrement of the Chief Patriarch, the denier, the defiler of the Truth, and they sought for it with such instance, and they so highly valued it that the high priests of the Greeks used to send it to all the countries of the Christians in silken wraps after mixing it with musk and ambergris. Hearing of it Kings would pay a thousand gold pieces for every dram and they sent for and sought it to fumigate brides withal; and the Chief Priests and the great Kings were wont to use a little of it as collyrium for the eyes and as a remedy in sickness and colic; and the Patriarchs used to mix their own skite[FN#390] with it, for that the skite of the Chief Patriarch could not suffice for ten countries.[FN#391] So, as soon as dawn was seen and the morning shone with its shine and sheen, the horsemen ran to their spears full keen, and King Afridun,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Ninetieth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, as soon as dawn was seen and the morning shone with its shine and sheen, the horsemen ran to their spears full keen and King Afridun summoned his chief Knights and Nobles and invested them with dresses of honour; and, drawing the sign of the cross on their brows, incensed them with the incense which as aforesaid was the skite of the Chief Patriarch, the Cohen, the Heresiarch. This incensing done, he called for Luka bin Shamlut, surnamed the Sword of the Messiah; and, after fumigating him and rubbing his palate with the Holy Merde, caused him to snuff it and smeared his cheeks and anointed his moustaches with the rest. Now there was no stouter champion in the land of Roum than this accursed Luka, nor any better at bending of bow or sway of sword or lunge with lance on the day of devoir; but he was foul of favour, for his face was as the face of an ass, his shape that of an ape and his look as the look of a malignant snake: his presence was grievouser than parting from the beloved make; and blacker than night was his blackness and more fetid than the lion was his breath for foulness; more crooked than a bow was his crookedness and grimmer than the leopard was his ugliness, and he was branded with the mark of the Infidels on face.[FN#392] After this he came up to King Afridun and kissed his feet and stood before him; and the King said to him, ""I desire thou go out against Sharrkan, King of Damascus, son of Omar bin al-Nu'uman, and deliver us from this affliction."" Quoth Luka, ""Hearkening and obedience;"" and the King made the sign of the cross on his forehead and felt assured of help from Heaven being near hand. Then Luka went out from the presence and the accursed one mounted a sorrel horse; he was clad in a red robe and a hauberk of gold set with jewels, and he bore a trident spear, as he were Iblis the damned on the day of drewing out his hosts war to darraign. Then he rode forward, he and his horde of Infidels, even as though they were driving to the Fire, preceded by a herald, crying aloud in the Arabic tongue and saying, ""Ho, sect of Mohammed (upon whom be salutation and salvation!), let none of you come out but your champion Sharrkan, the Sword of Al-Islam, Lord of Damascus in Shám[FN#393]!"" Nor had he made an end of speaking, when arose a tumult in the plain; all the people heard the strain and the whole moving bodies of the armies twain called to mind the Day of Complain. Then the cowards trembled and all necks turned towards the sound, and lo! it was King Sharrkan, son of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman. For when his brother, Zau al-Makan, saw that accursed one push out on the plain, and heard the pursuivant, he turned to Sharrkan and said to him, ""Of a surety they seek for thee."" Said he, ""Should it so be, 'twere most pleasing to me."" So when they made sure of the matter and heard the herald crying in the plain, ""Let none of you come out against me save Sharrkan,"" they knew this cursed Luka to be champion of the land of Roum who had sworn to sweep the earth clean of Moslems. Now he was one of the greatest of villains, a wretch who caused hearts to pain; and the DayIamites, Turks and Kurds dreaded his might and main. Presently Sharrkan crave at him like a lion angry grim, mounted on a courser like a wild gazelle flying snell and slim; and coming nigh to him made the spear he hent to shake as it were a darting snake, and recited these couplets,

""I have a sorrel steed, whose pride is fain to bear the rein, *
             Shall give thee what thou likest not and make thee feel his
             main:
I have a handy limber spear full bright and keen of point, * Upon
             whose shaft the dam of Death her throny seat hath ta'en:
I have a trenchant glaive of Hind; and, when I bare its face * Of
             scabbard"" veil, from out its brow the rays of levee rain.""

Luka understood not the sense of his speech nor did he apprehend the vehemence of the verse; but he smote his forehead with his hand, in honour of the Cross drawn thereon and kissed it; then he couched his throw spear and ran at Sharrkan. But first he tossed the javelin with one hand in air to such height that it was lost to the spectators' sight; and, catching it with the other hand as do the jugglers, hurled it at Sharrkan. It flew from his grasp like a shooting star and folk clamoured and feared for Sharrkan; but, as the spear flew near him, he put out his hand and caught it in full flight to the amazement of all who saw the sight. Then he shook it with the hand that took it till it was well nigh broken, and hurled it so high into the welkin that it disappeared from view. As it descended, he caught it again with the other hand, in less than the twinkling of an eye, and cried out from his heart core, saying, ""By the truth of Him who created the sevenfold skies, I will assuredly make this cursed wight a byword for mankind to despise!"" Then threw he the throw spear at Luka, who thought to do as Sharrkan had done and put forth his hand to trend it in mid flight; but Sharrkan prevented him, and sped at him a second throw spear which smote him and the point fell on his forehead, in the very centre of the sign of the Cross, and Allah hurried his soul to the Fire and Dwelling place dire.[FN#394] But when the Infidels saw Luka bin Shamlut fall slain, they buffeted their faces and they cried, ""Alas!"" and ""Woe worth the day!"" and called for aid upon the Abbots of the monasteries,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Ninety-first Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Infidels saw Luka bin Shamlut fall slain, they buffeted their faces and cried, ""Alas!"" and ""Woe worth the day!"" and called upon the Abbots of the monasteries and cried, ""Where be the crosses?"" So the Religious offered up prayers and the Christians all drew together against Sharrkan; and, brandishing their scymitars and lances, rushed forward to the attack. Then army met army and breasts fell under hoof, whilst spear and sword ruled the day and forearms and wrists grew weak and the coursers seemed created without legs;[FN#395] nor did the herald of-war cease calling to fight, till arms were aweary and day took flight and night came on with darkness dight. So the two hosts drew apart, whilst every brave staggered like a drunken knave, for that with so much cut and thrust they strave; and the place was choked with the slain; fell were the wounds and the hurt knew not by whom they fell. Then Sharrkan joined his brother, Zau al-Makan, and the Chamberlain and the Wazir Dandan, and said to them, ""Verily Allah hath opened a door for the Infidels to fall, praised be the Lord of the Worlds one and all!"" Replied Zau al-Makan, ""Let us never cease to praise Allah, for that He hath dispelled trouble from the Arab and the Ajam. Indeed the folk, generation after generation, shall tell of thy derring do against the accursed Luka, the falsifier of the Evangel;[FN#396] of thy catching the throng spear in mid-flight, and how the enemy of Allah among men thou didst smite; and thy fame shall endure until the end of time."" Then said Sharrkan, ""Harkye, O grand Chamberlain and doughty Capitayne!"" and he answered, ""Adsum!""[FN#397] Quoth Sharrkan, ""Take with thee the Wazir Dandan and twenty thousand horse, and lead them seven parasangs towards the sea, and force the march till ye shall have come near the shore, and there remain only two parasangs between thee and the foe. Then ambush ye in the hollows of the ground till ye hear the tumult of the Infidels disembarking from their ships; and the war cry from every side strike your ear and ye know that the sabres have begun labour between us and them; and, whenso ye see our troops falling back, as if defeated, and all the Infidels following them, as well those in front as those from the seaward and the tents, do ye still lie in wait for them: but as soon as ye see the standard with the words, There is no god but the God, and Mohammed is God's Apostle (on whom be salutation and salvation!), then up with the green banner, and do your endeavour and fall on their rear and shout, 'Alla ho Akbar! Allah is most Great!' and circle round that they may not interpose between the retreating army and the sea."" He replied, ""To hear is to obey!""; and forthright they agreed upon this matter and they went forth. Now the Chamberlain took with himself the Wazir Dandan and twenty thousand men even as Sharrkan had commanded. As soon as dawned the morn, the troops sprung to horse when they had donned their armour gear and drawn the scymitar and slung the spear. Then the Christians dispread themselves over hill and dale and the Ecclesiasts[FN#398] cried out and all heads were bared, and those in the ships hoisted the Cross at their mast heads and began making for shore from every side, and landed their horses and get them ready for fight and fray, whilst the sword blades glittered bright and the javelins glanced like levee light on mail shirt white; and all joined fight and the grind mill of Death whirled round and ground those who fought from horse and aground: heads from bodies flew end tongues mute grew and eyes no vision knew. Scymitars strave with utmost strain and heads flew over the battle plain; gall bladders crave and wrists were shorn in twain; steeds plashed in pools of gore and beards were gripped right sore; the host of Al-Islam called out, saying, ""On the Prince of Mankind be blessings and peace, and to the Compassionate glory and praise, which ne'er shall cease, for His boons which aye increase;"" and the host of the Infidels shouted, ""Glory to the Cross and the Belt and the vine press juice, and the wine presser and the Priests and the Monks and the Festival of Palms and the Metropolitan!"" Now Zau al-Makan and Sharrkan held back and their troops gave way and feigned flight from before the enemy, while the Infidel array pressed hard upon them deeming them in rout, and made ready to foin and hew. Then the meiny of the Moslems raised their voices, reciting the first verses of the Chapter of the Cow,[FN#399] whilst the dead were trampled under hoofs of steeds, and the heralds of the Greeks cried out, ""Ho, servants of the Messiah! Ho, people of the True Faith! Ho, followers of the Primate![FN#400] Verily Divine grace upon you opes; for see, the hosts of Al Islam like birds with broken wings incline to elope! So turn ye not to them your backs, but let your swords cleave deep in their necks and hold not your hands from them, else are ye outcasts from the Messiah, Mary's son, who spoke even when a cradled one!""[FN#401] Now Afridun, King of Constantinople, deemed that the Infidels were victorious, knowing not that this was but a clever stratagem of the Moslems, and sent to King Hardub of Roum congratulations on success, adding, ""Availed us naught but the Holy Merde of the Arch Patriarch, whose fragrance exhaled from the beards and mustachios of the slaves of the Cross near and far; and I swear, by the Miracles of the Messiah; and by thy daughter Abrizah, the Nazarene, the Mariolater; and by the Waters of Baptism, that I will not leave upon the earth a single defender of Al- Islam! And to the bitter end will I carry out this plan."" So the messenger betook himself with the address to King Hardub, whilst the Infidels called to one another saying, ""Take we vengeance wreak for Luka!""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Ninety-second Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Infidels called to one another, saying, ""Take we vengeance wreak for Luka!"" while Hardub King of Greece cried aloud, ""Ho, to our revenge for Abrizah!"" Thereupon King Zau al-Makan shouted ""Ho, servants of the Requiting King!: smite the children of denial and disobedience with the blanch of sword and the brown of spear!"" So the Moslems returned to the Infidels and plied them with the keen edged scymitar, whilst their herald cried aloud, ""Up, and at the foes of the Faith, all ye who love the Prophet Elect, with hope of salvation on the Day of Fear, to win favour of the Bountiful, the Forgiving One; for verily the Garden of Paradise is under the shadow of swords!"" And behold, Sharrkan and his men charged down upon the Infidels and cut off their retreat and wheeled and tourneyed among the ranks; when lo! a knight of goodly presence opened a passage through the army of Unbelievers and circled hither and thither amongst the Deniers, cutting and thrusting and covering the ground with heads and trunks, so that the Faithless feared him and their necks bent under his lunge and hew. He was girt with two swords, his glances and his brand, and he was armed with two lances, one of bamboo cane and the other his straight wand like shape; and his flowing hair stood him in stead of many warriors, even as saith the poet,

""Laud not long hair,[FN#402] except it be dispread * In two fold
            locks, on day of fight and fray,
O'er youth who bears his lance 'twixt flank and thigh, * From
             many a whis kered knight to win the day.""
And as singeth another,

""I say to him, what while he slings his sword, * 'For sword shall
             serve those looks that sword like show!'
Says he, 'My sabre looks for those I love, * My sword for those
             who sweets of love unknow!'""

When Sharrkan saw him, he said to him, ""I conjure thee by the Koran and the attributes of the Compassionate One, O Champion of the Champions! tell me who thou art: for verily by thy deeds this day thou hast pleased the Requiting King, whom one thing distracteth not from other thing; in that thou hast been discomforting the children of impiety and in rebellion revelling."" Then cried the Cavalier to him saying, ""Thou art he who madest brother covenant with me but yesterday: how quickly thou hast forgotten me!"" Thereupon he withdrew his mouth veil,[FN#403] so that what was hidden of his beauty was disclosed, and lo! it was none other than Zau al-Makan. Then Sharrkan rejoiced in his brother, save that he feared for him the rush of fighting and the crush of braves a smiting; and this for two reasons, the first, his tender age and exposure to the evil eye, and the second, that his safety was to the kingdom the greater of the two overshadowing wings. So he said to him, ""O King! thou riskest thy life, so join thy steed to mine; in very sooth I fear for thee from the foe; and better thou stint hazarding thyself forth of these squadrons, that we may shoot at the enemy thine unerring shaft."" Quoth Zau al-Makan, ""I desire to even thee in fray and I will not be niggard of myself before thee in the melay."" Then the host of Al-Islam, heaping itself upon the Infidels, girt them on all sides, warred on them a right Holy War, and brake the power of the children of impiety and pride and stowre. But King Afridun sighed when he saw the evil wreak that had fallen on the Greek, and they turned their backs from fight and addressed themselves to flight, making for the ships, when lo! there came out upon them from the seacoast another host, led by the Minister Dandan, the champion who was wont to make champions bite the dust, and to lay load on them with cut and thrust. Nor less came forth the Emir Bahram, Lord of the Provinces of Sham, amid twenty thousand horse doughty of arm; and the host of Al-Islam pressed them in front and on flank and wrought them grievous harm. Then a body of the Moslems turned against those who in the ships remained, and perdition on them rained, till they threw themselves into the main, and they slew of them many slain, more than a hundred thousand noblemen, nor was one of their champions, great or small, saved from bale and bane. Moreover, they took their ships, with all the money and treasure and cargo, save a score of keel, and the Moslems got that loot whose like was never gotten in by gone years; nor was such cut and thrust ever heard of by men's ears.[FN#404] Now amongst the booty were fifty thousand horses, besides treasure and spoil past reckoning and arithmetic, whereat the Moslems rejoiced with an exceeding joy for that Allah had given them victory and protection. Such was the case with them; but as regards the fugitive Infidels they soon reached Constantinople, whither the tidings preceded them that King Afridun had prevailed over the Moslems; so quoth the ancient dame, Zat al-Dawahi, ""I know that my son Hardub, King of Roum, is no runagate and that he feareth not the Islamitic hosts, but will restore the whole world to the Nazarene faith."" Then she bade the Great King, Afridun, give command that the city be decorated, and the people held festival high and drank their wines drunkenly and knew not the decrees of Destiny. Now whilst they were in the midst of their rejoicings, behold, the raven of dule and downfall croaked over them, and up came the twenty fugitive ships wherein was the King of Cæsarea. So King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople, met them on the sea shore, and they told him all that had befallen them from the Moslem, and they wept sore and groaned and moaned; and rejoicing at weal was turned into dismay for unheal; and they informed him concerning Luka son of Shamlut, how calamity had betided him and how Death had shot him with his shaft. Thereat the horrors of Doomday rose upon King Afridun,[FN#405] and he knew that there was no making straight their crook. Then came up from them the sound of weeping and wailing; the city was full of men mourning and the keepers were keening, and sighs and cries were heard from all sides. And when King Hardub of Greece met King Afridun he told him the truth of the case and how the flight of the Moslems was by way of stratagem and deceit, and said to him, ""Look not to see any of the army, save those who have already reached thee."" When King Afridun heard these words he fell down in a fainting fit, with his nose under his feet; and, as soon as he revived, he exclaimed, ""Surely the Messiah was wroth with them that he caused the Moslems to prevail over them!"" Then came the Arch Patriarch sadly to the King who said to him, ""O our father, annihilation hath overtaken our army and the Messiah hath punished us!"" Replied the Patriarch, ""Grieve not nor feel concerned, for it cannot be but that one of you have sinned against the Messiah, and all have been punished for his offence; but now we will read prayers for you in the churches, that the Mohammeden hosts may be repelled from you."" After which the old woman, Zat al-Dawahi, came to Afridun and said to him, ""O King, verily the Moslem hosts are many, and we shall never overcome them save by wile: wherefore I purpose to work upon them by guile and repair to this army of Al-Islam, haply I may win my wish of their leader and slay their champion, even as I slew his father. If my stratagem succeed in his case, not one of the host he leads shall return to his native land, for all are strong only because of him; but I desire to have some Christian dwellers of Syria, such as go out every month and year to sell their goods, that they may help me (for this they can do) in carrying out my plan."" Replied the King, ""Be it so whenever thou wilt."" So she bade fetch an hundred men, natives of Najrán,[FN#406] in Sham, and the King asked them, ""Have ye not heard what hath befallen the Christians with the Moslems?"" ""Yes,"" answered they; and he rejoined, ""Know ye that this woman hath devoted her life to the Messiah and purposeth to go forth with you, disguised as Monotheists and Mohammedans, to work out a device which shall profit us and hinder the Moslem from us: say, then, are ye also willing to devote yourselves to the Anointed and I will give you a quintal of gold?[FN#407] He of you who escapeth shall have the money, and him of you who dieth will the Messiah reward."" ""O King,"" replied they, ""we will devote our lives to the Messiah, and we will be thy sacrifice."" Thereupon the old woman took all she required of aromatic roots and placed them in water which she boiled over the fire till the black essence of them was extracted. She waited till the decoction was cold, then dipped the corner of a long kerchief therein and stained her face therewith. Moreover, she donned over her clothes a long gaberdine with an embroidered border and took in her hand a rosary, and afterwards went in to King Afridun, who knew her not, nor did any of his companions know her, till she discovered herself to them: and there was none in the assembly but who thanked and praised her for her cunning; and her son rejoiced and said, ""May the Messiah never fail thee!"" Thereupon she took with her the Syrian Christians, and set out for the army of Baghdad.— And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Ninety-third Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Afridun heard these words, he fell into a fainting fit with his nose under his feet; and, as soon as he revived, fear fluttered the scrotum[FN#408] below his belly and he complained to the ancient dame, Zat al-Dawahi. Now this accursed old woman was a witch of the witches, past mistress in sorcery and deception; wanton and wily, deboshed and deceptious; with foul breath, red eyelids, yellow cheeks, dull brown face, eyes bleared, mangy body, hair grizzled, back humped, skin withered and wan and nostrils which ever ran. But she had studied the scriptures of Al-Islam and had made the Pilgrimage to the Holy House of Meccah and all this that she might come to the knowledge of the Mohammedan ordinances and the miraculous versets of the Koran; and she had professed Judaism in the Holy City of Jerusalem[FN#409] for two years' space, that she might master the magic of men and demons; so that she was a plague of plagues and a pest of pests, wrong headed as to belief and to no religion fief. Now the chief reason of her sojourn with her son, King Hardub of Greece, was on account of the slave virgins at his court: for she was given to tribadism[FN#410] and could not exist without sapphism or she went mad: so if any damsel pleased her, she was wont to teach her the art of rubbing clitoris against clitoris and would anoint her with saffron[FN#411] till she fainted away for excess of volupty. Whoso obeyed her she was wont to favour and make her son incline towards her; but whoso repelled her she would contrive to destroy; and so she abode for a length of time. This was known to Marjanah and Rayhánah and Utrijah, the handmaids of Abrizah, and their Princess loathed the old woman and abhorred to lie with her, because of the rank smell from her armpits, the stench of her fizzles more fetid than carrion, and the roughness of her hide coarser than palm fibre. She was wont to bribe those who rubbed parts with her by means of jewels and instructions; but Abrizah held aloof from her and sought refuge with the Omnipotent, the Omniscient; for, by Allah, right well quoth the poet,

""Ho thou who grovellest low before the great * Nor over fording
             lesser men dost blench
Who gildest dross by dirham gathering, * No otter scent disguises
             carrion stench!

And now to return to the story of her stratagem and the woes of her working. Presently she departed, taking the chief Nazarenes with their hosts, and turned towards the army of the Moslems. Whereupon King Hardub went in to King Afridun and said to him, ""O King, we have no need of the Chief Patriarch nor of his prayers, but will consult my mother's counsel and observe what she will do with her craft unending against the Moslem hosts; for these are marching with all their power, they will soon be upon us and they will encircle us on all sides."" When King Afridun heard this, terror took hold upon his heart and he wrote letters, without stay or delay, to all the nations of the Nazarenes, saying, ""It behoveth none of the Messiahites or Cross knights to hold back, especially the folk of the strongholds and forts: but let them all come to us, foot and horse, women and children, for the Moslem hosts already tread our soil. So haste! haste ye! ere what we fear to us here appear."" Thus much concerning them; but regarding the work of the old woman, Zat al-Dawahi; when she went forth from the city with her suite, she clad them in the clothing of Moslem merchants, having provided herself with an hundred mules carrying stuffs of Antioch, such as goldwoven satins and royal brocades and so forth. And she had taken a letter from King Afridun to the following effect: ""These be merchantmen from the land of Sham who have been with us: so it besitteth none to do them harm or hindrance, nor take tax and tithe of them, till they reach their homes and safe places, for by merchants a country flourisheth, and these are no men of war nor of ill faith."" Then quoth the accursed Zat al-Dawahi to those with her, ""Verily I wish to work out a plot for the destruction of the Moslem."" Replied they, ""O Queen, command us whatso thou wilt; we are at thy disposal and may the Messiah never disappoint thy dealings!"" Then she donned a gown of fine white wool and rubbed her forehead, till she made a great mark as of a scar and anointed it with an ointment of her own fashion, so that it shone with prodigious sheen. Now the old hag was lean bodied and hollow eyed, and she bound her legs tightly round with cords[FN#412] just above her feet, till she drew near the Moslem camp, when she unwound them, leaving their marks deeply embedded in her ankles. Then she anointed the wheels with dragon's blood and bade her companions beat her with a severe beating, and set her in a chest and, quoth she, ""Cry abroad the Refrain of Unity,[FN#413] nor fear from it aught of damage!"" Replied they, ""How can we beat thee, who be our sovereign lady, Zat al-Dawahi, mother of the King we glory in?"" Then said she, ""We blame not nor deal reproach to him who goeth to the jakes, and in need evil becometh good deed. When ye have set me in the chest, take it and make it one of the bales and place it on mule back and fare forth with it and the other goods through the Moslem camp, and fear ye no blame. And if any of the Moslems hinder you, give up the mules and their lading and be take yourselves to their King, Zau al-Makan, and implore his protection saying, 'We were in the land of the Infidels and they took nothing from us, but wrote us a passport, that none shall do us hindrance or work our mischance.' If he ask you, 'What profit had ye of your property in the land of Roum?' answer him, 'We profited in the deliverance of a pious man, who had been bound down in an underground cell nigh fifteen years, crying out for help yet none helped him. Nay, the Infidels tortured him night and day. We knew not this; but, after we had tarried in Constantinople for some time, having sold our goods and bought others in their stead, we determined on and made ready for a return to our native land. We spent that night conversing about our journey and when day broke, we saw figured upon the wall a human form and as we drew nigh it, behold, it moved and said, 'O Moslems, is there amongst you one who is minded to woo the favour of the Lord of the three Worlds?'[FN#414] 'How so?' asked we; and the figure answered, 'Know that Allah hath made me speak to you, to the intent that your faith be fortified, and that your belief embolden you and that you may go forth of the country of the Infidels and repair to the Moslem host; for with them wones the Sword of the Com passionate One, of our Age the Champion, King Sharrkan, by whom He shall conquer Constantinople town and destroy the sect of the Nazarene. And when ye shall have journeyed three days, you will find an hermitage known as the Hermitage of the ascetic Matruhina[FN#415] and containing a cell; visit it with pure intent and contrive to arrive there by force of will, for therein is a Religious from the Holy City, Jerusalem, by name Abdullah, and he is one of the devoutest of mankind, endowed with the power of working saintly miracles[FN#416] such as dispel doubts and obscurity. Certain of the monks seized him by fraud and shut him up in a souterrain where he hath lain a long time. By his deliverance you will please the Lord of Faithful Men, for such release is better than fighting for the Faith.'"" Now when the ancient dame and those with her had agreed upon such words, she said, ""As soon as that which I impart shall reach the ears of King Sharrkan, say him further, 'Hearing this from that image we knew that the holy man'""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Ninety-fourth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the old woman, Zat al-Dawahi, and those with her had agreed upon such words, she said, ""Now as soon as that which I impart shall reach the ears of King Sharrkan say him further, 'Hearing these words from that image we knew that the holy man was indeed of the chiefest devotees and Allah's servants of purest qualities; so we made three days' march till we came in sight of that hermitage, and then we went up to it and passed the day in buying and selling, as is the wont of merchants. As soon as day had departed our sight and night was come to darken light, we repaired to the cell wherein was the dungeon, and we heard the holy man, after chanting some verses of the Koran, repeat the following couplets,

'My heart disheartened is, my breast is strait, * And sinks my
            soul in sea of bale and bate
Unless escape be near I soon shall die; * And Death were better
             than this doleful strait:
O Lightning an thou light my home and folk, * An their still
             brighter charms thy shine abate,
Say, what my path to meet them, being barred * By wars, and
             barricado'd succour's gate?'

""When once ye have brought me into the Moslem camp, and I mix with them you shall see,"" the old woman continued, ""how I will make shift to beguile them and slay them all, even to the last man."" The Nazarenes hearing whet she said, kissed her hands and set her in the chest, after they had beaten her with a grievous beating in obedience to her commands, for they saw it was incumbent on them to do her bidding in this; then they all made for the Moslem host as hath erst been said. Such was the case with the damned hag, Zat al-Dawahi and her companions; but as regards the Mohammeden army, they indeed, after Allah had given them victory over their enemies and they had plundered everything in the ships of money and hoards, all sat down to converse with one another and Zau al-Makan said to his brother Sharrkan, ""Verily, Allah hath granted us to prevail because of our just dealing and discipline and concord amongst ourselves; wherefore continue, O Sharrkan, to obey my commandment, in submission to Allah (be He exalted and extolled!), for I mean to slay ten Kings in blood revenge for my sire, to cut the throat of fifty thousand Greeks and to enter Constantinople."" Replied Sharrkan, ""My life be thy ransom against death! Needs must I follow out the Holy War, though I wone many a year in their country. But I have, O my brother, in Damascus a daughter, named Kuzia Fakan, whom I love heartily for she is one of the marvels of the time and she will soon be of age.' Said Zau al-Makan, ""And I also have left my wife with child and near her time, nor do I know what Allah will vouchsafe me by her. But promise me, O my brother, that if Allah bless me with a son, thou wilt grant me thy daughter for wife to him, and make covenant with me and pledge me thy faith thereon."" ""With love and good will, replied Sharrkan; and, stretching out his hand to his brother, he said, If she bring thee a son, I will give him my daughter Kuzia Fakan, to wife."" At this Zau al-Makan rejoiced, and they fell to congratulating each other on the victory over the enemy. And the Wazir Dandan also congratulated the two brothers and said to them, ""Know, O ye Kings, that Allah hath given us the victory, for that we have devoted our lives to Him (be He exalted and ex tolled!); and we have left our homes and households; and it is my counsel that we follow up the foe and press upon him and harass him, so haply Allah shall enable us to win our wishes, and we shall destroy our enemies, branch and root. If it please you, do ye go down in these ships and sail over the sea, whilst we fare forward by land and bear the brunt of battle and the thrust of fight."" And the Minister Dandan ceased not to urge them to combat and repeated his words who said,

""To slay my foes is chiefest bliss I wist, * And on the courser's
            back be borne a list;
Comes promising tryst a messenger from friend * Full oft, when
            comes the friend withouten tryst.""
And these words of another,

""War for my mother (an I live) I'll take; * Spear for my brother;
           scymitar for sire
With every shag haired brave who meets his death * Smiling, till
           won from Doom his dear desire!""

And when the Wazir ended his verses, he said, ""Praise be to Him who aided us dear victory to uphold and who hath given us spoil of silver and fine gold!"" Then Zau al-Makan commanded the army to depart; and they fared on forcing their marches for Constantinople, till they came to a wide and spacious champaign, full of all things fair and fain, with wild cattle frisking and gazelles pacing to and fro across the plain. Now they had traversed great deserts and drink had been six days cut off from them, when they drew near this meadow and saw therein waters founting and ripe fruits daunting and that land as it were Paradise; for it had donned its adornments and decked itself.[FN#417] Gently waved the branches of its trees drunken with the new wine of the dew, and combined with the nectar of Tasnim the soft breathings of the morning breeze. Mind and gazer were confounded by its beauty, even as saith the poet,

""Behold this lovely garden! 'tis as though * Spring o'er its
           frame her greeny cloak had spread.
Looking with fleshly eyne, thou shalt but sight * A lake whose
            waters balance in their bed,
But look with spirit eyes and lo! shalt see * Glory in every
           leaf o'erwaves thy head.""

And as another saith,

""The stream's a cheek by sunlight rosy dyed, * Whose down[FN#418]
          is creeping shade of tamarisk stems
Round legs of tree trunks waveless roll in rings * Silvern, and
           blossoms are the diadems.""

When Zau al-Makan saw this champaign, with its trees bowing and its flowers blooming and its birds warbling, he called to his brother Sharrkan and said, ""O my brother, verily in Damascus is naught the like of this place. We will not march from it save after three days, that we may take rest ourselves and that the army of Al-Islam may regain strength and their souls be fortified to encounter the blamed Infidels."" So they halted therein and while camping behold, they heard a noise of voices from afar, and Zau al-Makan asked the cause thereof, and was answered that a caravan of merchants from the Land of Syria had halted there to rest and that the Moslem troops had come on them and had haply seized something of the goods which they had brought from the country of the Infidels. After a while up came the merchants, crying out and appealing to the King for aidance. When Zau al- Makan saw this, he bade them be brought before him and, when in presence they said to him, ""O King, we have been in the country of the Infidels and they plundered us of nothing: why then do our brothers the Moslems despoil our goods, and we in their own land? Of a truth when we saw your troops, we went up to them and they robbed us of what we had with us and we have now reported to thee all that hath befallen us."" Thereupon they brought out to him the letter of the King of Constantinople, and Sharrkan read it and said, ""We will presently restore to you what hath been taken from you; but yet it behoveth you not to carry merchandise to the country of the Infidels."" Replied they, ""O our Lord, in very sooth Allah despatched us thither that we might win what Gházi[FN#419] never won the like of, not even thou in all thy razzias."" Asked Sharrkan, ""What was it ye won?"" ""O King,"" answered they, ""we will not tell thee save in private; for if this matter be noised among the folk, haply it may come to the ears of some,[FN#420] and this will be the cause of our ruin and of the ruin of all Moslems who resort to the land of the Greeks."" Now they had hidden the chest wherein was the damned Zat al- Dawahi. So Zau al-Makan and his brother brought them to a private place, where they laid bare to both of them the story of the devotee, and wept till they made the two Kings weep.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Ninety-fifth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Nazarenes who wore merchants' weed, when brought to a private place by Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan, laid bare to both of them the story of the devotee and wept till they made the two Kings weep and repeated to them all which had been taught by the old witch Zat al-Dawahi. Thereupon Sharrkan's heart yearned to the devotee and he was moved to ruth for him and was fired with zeal for the service of Almighty Allah. So quoth he to them, ""Did ye rescue this holy man or is he still in the hermitage?"" Quoth they, ""We delivered him and slew the hermit, fearing for our lives; after which we made haste to fly for dread of death; but a trusty man told us that in this hermitage are quintals of gold and silver and stones of price."" Then they fetched the chest and brought out the accursed old woman, as she were a cassia pod[FN#421] for excess of blackness and leanness, and she was laden with the same fetters and shackles. When Zau al-Makan and the bystanders saw her, they took her for a man of the best of Allah's devotees and surpassing in pious qualities, more especially because of the shining of her forehead for the ointment wherewith she had anointed her face. So Zau al-Makan and Sharrkan wept sore; then they rose up in honour and kissed her hands and feet, sobbing aloud: but she signed to them and said, ""Cease this weeping and hear my words. Hereat they dried their tears in obedience to her bidding, and she said, ""Know ye both that I was content to accept what my Lord did unto me, for I kenned that the affliction which befel me was a trial from Him (be He exalted and extolled!); and whoso hath not patience under calamity and tribulation, for him there is no coming to the delights of Paradise. I had indeed supplicated Him that I might return to my native land, not as a compensation for the sufferings decreed to me, but that I might die under the horse hoofs of warriors fighting for the Faith who, being slain in fray, live again without suffering death.""[FN#422] Then she repeated the following couplets,

""Our Fort is Tor,[FN#423] and flames the fire of fight: * Moses
            art thou and this is time for aid:
Cast down thy rod, 'twill swallow all they wrought, * Nor dread
            for men their ropes be vipers made.[FN#424]
For Chapters read on fight day lines of foes, * And on their
            necks 'grave versets[FN#425] wi' thy blade!""

When the old woman had ended her verse, her eyes overflowed with tears and her forehead under the unguent shone like gleaming light, and Sharrkan rose and kissed her hand and caused food be brought before her: but she refused it, saying, ""I have not broken my fast by day for fifteen years; and how should I break it at such a time when my Lord hath been bountiful to me in delivering me from the captivity of the Infidels and removing from me that which was more grievous to me than torment of fire? I will wait till sun down."" So when it was nightfall, Sharrkan and Zau al-Makan came and served her with food and said, ""Eat, O ascetic!"" But she said, ""This is no time for eating; it is the time for worshipping the Requiting King."" Then she stood up in the prayer niche and remained praying till the night was spent; and she ceased not to do after this fashion for three days and nights, sitting not but at the time of the Salám or salutation[FN#426] ending with several prayers. When Zau al- Makan saw her on this wise, firm belief in her get hold of his heart and he said to Sharrkan, ""Cause a tent of perfumed leather to be pitched for this Religious, and appoint a body servant to wait upon him."" On the fourth day she called for food; so they brought her all kinds of meats that could seduce the sense or delight the sight; but of all this she would eat only a scone with salt. Then she again turned to her fast and, as the night came, she rose anew to pray; when Sharrkan said to Zau al-Makan, ""Verily, this man carrieth renunciation of the world to the extreme of renouncing, and, were it not for this Holy War, I would join myself to him and worship Allah in his service, till I came before His presence. And now I desire to enter his tent and talk with him for an hour."" Quoth Zau al-Makan, ""And I also: tomorrow we sally forth to fight against Constantinople, and we shall find no time like the present."" Said the Wazir Dandan, ""And I no less desire to see this ascetic; haply he will pray for me that I find death in this Holy War and come to the presence of my Lord, for I am aweary of the world."" So as soon as night had darkened, they repaired to the tent of that witch, Zat al-Dawahi; and, seeing her standing to pray, they drew near her and fell a weeping for pity of her; but she paid no heed to them till midnight was past, when she ended her orisons by pronouncing the salutation. Then she turned to them and after wishing them long life, asked them ""Wherefore come ye?"", whereto they answered, ""O thou holy man! diddest thou not hear us weep around thee?"" She rejoined, ""To him who standeth in the presence of Allah, remaineth no existence in time, either for hearing any or for seeing aught about him."" Quoth they, ""We would have thee recount to us the cause of thy captivity and pray for us this night, for that will profit us more than the possession of Constantinople."" Now when she heard their words she said, ""By Allah, were ye not the Emirs of the Moslems, I would not relate to you aught of this at any time; for I complain not but to Allah alone. However, to you I will relate the circumstances of my captivity. Know, then, that I was in the saintly City of Jerusalem with certain ecstatics and inspired men, and did not magnify myself among them, for that Allah (be He exalted and extolled!) had endowed me with humility and abnegation, till I chanced to go down to the sea one night and walked upon the water. Then entered into me pride; whence I know not, and I said to myself, 'Who like me can walk the water?' And my heart from that time hardened and Allah afflicted me with the love of travel. So I journeyed to Roum land and visited every part for a whole year, and left no place but therein I worshiped Allah. When I came to this spot,[FN#427] I clomb the mountain and saw there an hermitage, inhabited by a monk called Matrubina, who, when he sighted me, came out and kissed my hands and feet and said, 'Verily, I have seen thee since thou enteredst the land of the Greeks, and thou hast filled me with longing for the land of Al-Islam.' Then he took my hand and carried me into that hermitage, and brought me to a dark room; and, when I entered it unawares, he locked the door on me and left me there forty days, without meat or drink; for it was his intent to kill me by delay. It chanced one day, that a Knight called Dakianús[FN#428] came to the hermitage, accompanied by ten squires and his daughter Tamásil, a girl whose beauty was incom parable. When they entered that hermitage, the monk Matruhina told them of me, and the Knight said, 'Bring him out, for surely there is not on him a bird's meal of meat.' So they opened the door of the dark room and found me standing in the niche, praying and reciting the Koran and glorifying Allah and humbling myself before the Almighty. When they saw me in this state Matrohina exclaimed, 'This man is indeed a sorcerer of the sorcerers!'; and hearing his words, they all came in on me, Dakianus and his company withal, and they beat me with a grievous beating, till I desired death and reproached myself, saying, 'This is his reward who exalteth himself and who prideth himself on that which Allah hath vouchsafed to him, beyond his own competence! And thou, O my soul, verily self esteem and arrogance have crept into thee. Dost thou not know that pride angereth the Lord and hardeneth the heart and bringeth men to the Fire?' Then they laid me in fetters and returned me to my place which was the dungeon under ground. Every three days, they threw me down a scone of barley bread and a draught of water; and every month or two the Knight came to the hermitage. Now his daughter Tamasil had grown up, for she was nine years old when I first saw her, and fifteen years passed over me in captivity, so that she had reached her four and twentieth year. There is not in our land nor in the land of the Greeks a fairer than she, and her father feared lest the King take her from him; for she had vowed herself to the Messiah and rode with Dakianus in the habit of a cavalier, so that albeit none might compare with her in loveliness, no one who saw her knew her for a woman. And her father had laid up his monies in this hermitage, every one who had aught of price or treasured hoard being wont to deposit it therein; and I saw there all manner of gold and silver and jewels and precious vessels and rarities, none may keep count of them save Almighty Allah. Now ye are worthier of these riches than those Infidels; so lay hands on that which is in the hermitage and divide it among the Moslems and especially on fighters in the Holy War. When these merchants came to Constantinople and sold their merchandise, that image which is on the wall spoke to them, by grace of a marvel which Allah granted to me; so they made for that hermitage and slew Matruhina, after torturing him with most grievous torments, and dragging him by the beard, till he showed them the place where I was; when they took me and found no path but flight for dread of death. Now tomorrow night Tamasil will visit that hermitage as is her habit, and her father and his squires will come after her, as he feareth for her; so, if ye would witness these things, take me with you and I will deliver to you the monies and the riches of the Knight Dakianus which be in that mountain; for I saw them bring out vessels of gold and silver to drink therefrom, and I heard a damsel of their company sing to them in Arabic and well-away! that so sweet a voice should not be busied in chaunting the Koran. If, then, ye will; enter into that hermitage and hide there against the coming of Dakianus and his daughter; and take her, for she is fit only for the King of the Age, Sharrkan, or King Zau al-Makan."" Thereat they all rejoiced with the exception of the Wazir Dandan, who put scant faith in her story, for her words took no hold on his reason, and signs of doubt in her and disbelief showed in his face.[FN#429] Yet he was confounded at her discourse, but he feared to speak with her for awe of the King. Then quoth the ancient dame, Zat al-Dawahi, ""Verily, I fear lest the Knight come and, seeing these troops encamped in the meadow, be afraid to enter the hermitage."" So Zau al-Makan ordered the army to march upon Constantinople and said, ""I have resolved to take with me an hundred horse and many mules and make for that mountain, where we will load the beasts with the monies which be in the hermitage."" Then he sent at once for the Chief Chamberlain whom they brought into the presence; and he summoned likewise the leaders of the Turks and Daylamites and said, ""As soon as it is dawn, do ye set forth for Constantinople; and thou, O Chamberlain, shalt take my place in council and contrivance, while thou, O Rustam, shalt be my brother's deputy in battle. But let none know that we are not with you and after three days we will rejoin you."" Then he chose out an hundred of the doughtiest riders, and he and Sharrkan and the Minister Dandan set out for the hermitage, and the hundred horsemen led the mules with chests for transporting the treasure.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Ninety-sixth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkan and his brother, Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan set off with an hundred horse for the hermitage described to them by that accursed Zat al-Dawahi, and they took with them mules and chests for transporting the treasure. Now as soon as dawned the morn, the Chamberlain signalled to the host an order for departure, and they set out thinking that the two Kings and the Wazir were with them; knowing not that the three had made for the monastery. Such was the case with the host, but as regards the two Kings and the Minister, they tarried in their place till the end of that day. Now the Infidels who were with Zat al-Dawahi took their departure privily, after they had gone in to her and kissed her hands and feet and obtained her leave to march. So she not only gave them permission but also taught them all she minded of wile and guile. And when it was dark night, she arose and went in to Zau al-Makan and his companions and said to them, ""Come, let us set out for the mountain, and take with you a few men at arms."" They obeyed her and left five horsemen at the foot of the mountain, whilst the rest rode on before Zat al-Dawahi, who gained new strength for excess of joy, so that Zau al-Makan said, ""Glory be to Him who sustaineth this holy man, whose like we never saw!"" Now the witch had written a letter to the King of Constantinople and despatched it on the wings of a bird,[FN#430] acquainting him with what had passed and ending, ""I wish thee to send me ten thousand horsemen of the bravest of the Greeks and let them steal along the foot of the mountains with caution, lest the host of Al-Islam get sight of them; and, when they reach the hermitage, let them ambush themselves there, till I come to them with the Moslem King and his brother, for I shall inveigle them and will bring them thither, together with the Wazir and an hundred horse and no more, that I may presently deliver to them the crosses which be in the hermitage. I am resolved to slay the Monk Matruhina, since my scheme cannot be carried out but by taking his life. If my plot work well, not one of the Moslems shall return to his own country; no, not a living wight nor one who blows the fire alight; and Matruhina shall be a sacrifice for the followers of the Nazarene faith and the servants of the Cross, and praise be to the Messiah, first and last."" When this letter reached Constantinople, the keeper of the carrier pigeons carried it to King Afridun, who read it and forthwith inspected his host and equipped ten thousand cavaliers with horses and dromedaries and mules and provaunt and bade them repair to that hermitage and, after reaching the tower, to hide therein. Thus far concerning them; but as regards King Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and the Wazir Dandan and the escort, when they reached the hermitage they entered and met the Monk Matruhina, who came out to see who and what they were; whereupon quoth that pious man Zat al-Dawahi, ""Slay this damned fellow.""[FN#431] So they smote him with their swords and made him drink the cup of death. Then the accursed old woman carried them to the place of offerings and ex votos, and brought out to them treasures and precious things more than she had described to them; and after gathering the whole together, they set the booty in chests and loaded the mules therewith. As for Tamasil, she came not, she or her father, for fear of the Moslems; so Zau al-Makan tarried there, awaiting her all that day and the next and a third, till Sharrkan said to him, ""By Allah, I am troubled anent the army of Al-Islam, for I know not what is become of them."" His brother replied, ""And I also am concerned for them: we have come by this great treasure and I do not believe that Tamasil or any one else will approach the hermitage, after that befel which hath befallen the host of the Christians. It behoveth us, then, to content ourselves with what Allah hath given us and depart; so haply He will help us conquer Constantinople."" Accordingly they came down from the mountain, while Zat al-Dawahi was impotent to oppose their march for fear of betraying her deceit; and they fared forwards till they reached the head of a defile, where the old woman had laid an ambush for them with the ten thousand horse. As soon as these saw the Moslems they encircled them from all sides, couching lance and baring the white sabre blade; and the Infidels shouted the watch word of their faithless Faith and set the shafts of their mischief astring. When Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and the Minister Dandan looked upon this host, they saw that it was a numerous army and said, ""Who can have given these troops information of us?"" Replied Sharrkan, ""O my brother, this be no time for talk; this is the time for smiting with swords and shooting with shafts) so gird up your courage and hearten your hearts, for this strait is like a street with two gates; though, by the virtue of the Lord of Arabs and Ajams, were not the place so narrow I would bring them to naught, even though they were an hundred thousand men!"" Said Zau al-Makan, ""Had we wotted this we would have brought with us five thousand horse;"" and the Wazir Dandan continued, ""If we had ten thousand horse they had availed us naught in these narrows; but Allah will succour us against them. I know this defile and its straitness, and I know there be many places of refuge in it; for I have been here on razzia with King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, what while we besieged Constantinople. We abode in this place, and here is water colder than snow. So come, let us push out of this defile ere the Infidel host increase on us and get the start of us to the mountain top, whence they will hurl down rocks upon us, and we powerless to come at them."" So they began hurrying on to get out of those narrows; but the pious man, Zat al-Dawahi, looked at them and said, ""What is it ye fear, ye who have vowed yourselves to the Lord, and to working His will? By Allah, I abode imprisoned underground for fifteen years, yet never gainsaid the Almighty in aught he did with me! Fight ye in Allah's way; so whoever of you is slain Paradise shall be his abode, and whoso slayeth, his striving shall be to his honour."" When they heard from the ascetic these words, their care and anxiety ceased from them and they stood firm till the Infidels charged down from all sides, whilst the swords played upon their necks and the cup of death went round amongst them. The Moslems fought for the service of Allah a right good fight, and wrought upon His foes with sway of sword and lunge of lance; whilst Zau al-Makan smote upon the men and garred the knights bite the dust and their heads from their bodies take flight, five by five and ten by ten, till he had done to death a number of them past numbering and an accompt beyond counting. Now while so doing, he looked at the accursed old woman who was waving her sword and heartening them, and all who feared fled to her for shelter; but she was also signing the Infidels to slay Sharrkan. So troop after troop rushed on him with design to do him die; but each troop that charged, he charged and drove back; and when another troop attacked him he repelled the assault with the sword in their backs; for he thought it was the devotee's blessing that gave him the vic tory, and he said in himself, ""Verily on this holy men Allah looketh with eyes of His favour and strengtheneth my prowess against the Infidels with the purity of his pious intent: for I see that they fear me and cannot prevail against me, but every one who assaileth me turneth tail and taketh flight."" So they battled the rest of the day and, when night fell, the Moslems took refuge in a cave of that defile being weary with stress of war and cast of stone: and that day were slain of them five and forty. And when they were gathered together, they sought the devotee, but could find no trace of him; and this was grievous to them and they said, ""Belike, he hath died a martyr."" Quoth Sharrkan, ""I saw him heartening the horsemen with divine instances and using as talisman verses of Holy Writ."" Now while they were talking, behold, the accursed old woman, Zat al-Dawahi, stood before them, hending in hand the head of the Chief Captain of the ten thousand horse, a noble knight, a champion fierce in fight and a Satan for blight. One of the Turks had slain him with an arrow, and Allah hurried his soul to the fire; and when the Infidels saw what that Moslem had done with their leader, they all fell on him and wrought his bane and hewed him in pieces with their swords, and Allah hurried his soul to Heaven. Then the accursed old woman cut off that Knight's head and brought it and threw it at the feet of Sharrkan and Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan. Now when Sharrkan sew her, he sprang up hastily before her and exclaimed, ""Praised be Allah for thy safety and for our sighting thee, O holy man and devout champion of the Religion!"" Replied she, O my son, I have sought martyrdom this day, and have thrown my life away amid the Infidel array, but they feared me with dismay. When ye dispersed, I waxed jealous for your honour; so I rushed on the Chief Knight their leader, albeit he was a match for a thousand horse, and I smote him till I severed head from trunk. Not one of the Infidels could near me; so I brought his head to you,""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Ninety-seventh Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the damned witch, Zat al-Dawahi, took the head of the Knight, the leader of the twenty thousand Infidels, she brought it and threw it down before Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and the Wazir Dandan, saying, ""When I saw your condition, I waxed jealous for your honour; so I rushed on the Chief Knight and smote him with the sword till I severed head from trunk. And none could near me, so I brought his head to you, that you may be strengthened in Holy War and work out with your swords the will of the Lord of the Faithful. And now I purpose leaving you to strive against the Infidels, whilst I go to your army, though they be at the gates of Constantinople, and return with twenty thousand horse to destroy these Unfaithfuls."" Quoth Sharrkan, ""How wilt thou pass to them, O thou holy man, seeing that the valley is blocked up on all sides by the Miscreants?"" Quoth the accursed hag, ""Allah will veil me from their eyes and they shall not sight me;[FN#432] nor, if any saw me, would he dare to attack me at that time, for I shall be as one non existing, absorbed in Allah, and He will fend off from me His foes."" ""Thou sayest sooth, O holy man,"" rejoined Sharrkan, ""for indeed I have been witness of that; so, if thou can pass out at the first of the night, 'twill be best for us."" Replied she, ""I will set out at this very hour and, if thou desire, thou shalt go with me and none shall see thee. Furthermore if thy brother also have a mind to go with us we will take him, but none else; for the shadow of a saint can cover only twain."" Sharrkan said, ""As for me I will not leave my comrades; but, if my brother will, there is no harm in his going with thee and setting us free of this strait; for he is the stronghold of the Moslems and the sword of the Lord of the three Worlds; and if it be his pleasure, let him take with him the Wazir Dandan, or whom else he may elect and send us ten thousand horse to succour us against these caitiffs."" So after debate they agreed on this and the old woman said, ""Give me leisure to go before you and consider the condition of the Infidels, if they be asleep or awake."" Quoth they, ""We will not go forth save with thee and trust our affair to Allah."" ""If I do your bidding,"" replied she, ""blame me not but blame yourselves; for it is my rede that you await me till I bring you tidings of the case."" Then said Sharrkan, ""Go to them and delay not from us, for we shall be awaiting thee."" Thereupon she fared forth and Sharrkan turned to his brother addressing him and said, ""Were not this holy man a miracle worker, he had never slain yonder furious knight. This is proof sufficient of the ascetic's power; and of a truth the pride of the Infidels is laid low by the slaying of this cavalier, for he was violent, an evil devil and a stubborn."" Now whilst they were thus devising of the mighty works of the devotee, behold, the accursed Zat al-Dawahi came upon them and promised them victory over the Unbelievers; wherefor they thanked her (not knowing that all this was wile and guile) and the damned hag asked, ""Where be the King of the Age, Zau al-Makan, and the Minister Dandan?"" Answered he, ""Here am I!"" Take with thee thy Wazir,"" said she, ""and follow after me, that we may fare forth to Constantinople."" Now she had acquainted the Infidels with the cheat she had put upon the Moslems, and they rejoiced with exceeding great joy, and said, Our hearts will not be contented till we shall have slain their King in return for the Knight's death; because we had no stouter rider than he;"" and they added (bespeaking the ill omened hag as she told them her plan of faring to the land of the Moslems), ""When thou bringest him to us, we will bear him to King Afridun."" Then she went out and went out with her Zau al-Makan and the Minister Dandan, and she walked on before the two saying, ""Fare forth with the blessing of Almighty Allah!"" So they did her bidding, for the shaft of Pate and Fortune of man's lot had shot them, and she ceased not leading them both through the midst of the Grecian camp, till they came to the defile, the narrow pass aforesaid, whilst the Infidel enemy watched them, but did them no hindrance; for the infernal old woman had enjoined this. Now when Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan saw that the Infidel host offered them no let and stay and yet had them in sight, the Wazir exclaimed, ""By Allah, this is one of the holy man's saintly miracles! and doubtless he be of the elect."" Rejoined Zau al-Makan, ""By Allah, I think the Infidels be naught but blind, for we see them and they see us not."" And while they were thus praising the holy man and recounting his mighty works and his piety and his prayers, behold, the Infidels charged down on them from all sides and surrounded them and seized them, saying, ""Is there anyone else with you twain, that we may seize upon him too?"" And the Wazir Dandan replied, ""See you not yon other man that is before us? ' Replied the Unbelievers, ""By the truth of the Messiah and the Monks, and the Primate and the Metropolitan, we see none save you two!"" Then Zau Al-Makan said, ""By Allah, this is a chastisement decreed to us by Almighty Allah!""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Ninety-eighth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Unfaithful had seized upon King Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan, they said to the two, ""Is there anyone else with you twain, that we may seize upon him also?"" And the Wazir Dandan replied, ""See you not yon other man who be with us?"" They rejoined, ""By the truth of the Messiah and the Monks and the Primate and the Metropolitan, we see none save you two!"" Then the Infidels laid shackles on their feet and set men to guard them during the night, whilst Zat al-Dawahi fared on and disappeared from their sight. So they fell to lamenting and saying to each other, ""Verily, the opposing of pious men leadeth to greater distress than this, and we are punished by the strait which hath befallen us."" So far concerning Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan; but as regards King Sharrkan, he passed that night in the cavern with his comrades, and when dawned the day and he had prayed the morn prayer, he and his men made ready to do battle with the Infidel and he heartened them and promised them all good. Then they sallied out till they were hard upon the Unbelievers and, when these saw them from afar, they cried out to them, saying, ""O Moslems, we have taken captives your Sultan and your Wazir who hath the ordering of your affairs; and except ye leave off fighting us, we will slay you to the last man; but an you yield yourselves we will take you to our King, who will make peace with you on condition that you quit our country and return home and harm us in naught, and we will do you no harm in aught. If ye accept, it will be well for you; but if ye refuse there remaineth nothing for you but death. So we have told you sooth, and this is our last word to you."" Now when Sharrkan heard this and was certified of the captivity of his brother and the Wazir Dandan, he was weighed down with woe and wept; his force failed him and, making sure of death, he said to himself, ""Would I knew the cause of their capture! Did they fail of respect to the holy man or disobey him, or what was the matter?"" Then they sprang up to battle with the Unbelievers and slew great numbers of them. The brave was known that day from craven men, and sword and spear were dyed with bloody stain; for the Infidels flocked up on them, as flies flock to drink, from hill and from plain; but Sharrkan and his men ceased not to wage the fight of those who fear not to die, nor let death hinder them from the pursuit of victory, till the valley ran gore and earth was full of the slain she bore. And when night fell the armies separated each making for his own place; and the Moslems returned to the cavern where gain and loss were manifest to them: few remained of them and there was no dependence for them but on Allah and the scymitar. Now there had been slain of them that day five and thirty men of the chiefest Emirs, and they had killed thousands of the Infidels, footmen and fighters on horse. When Sharrkan saw this, the case was grievous to him and he asked his comrades ""What shall we do?""; whereto all answered, ""That which Almighty Allah willeth shall befal us."" On the morning of the second day, Sharrkan said to the remnant of his troop, ""If ye go forth to fight, not one of you will remain alive and we have but little left of food and water; so I deem ye would do better to bare your brands and go forth and stand at the mouth of this cavern, to hinder any from entering. Haply the holy man may have reached the Moslem host, and may return with ten thousand horses to succour us in fight with the Infidels, for belike the Unfaithful may have failed to see him and those with him."" They said, This were the better course to take, and of its expediency no doubt we make."" So the troop went out and held the cavern mouth standing by its walls; and every one of the Infidels who sought to enter in, they slew. Thus did they fend off the foe from the gape of the cave and they patiently supported all such assaults, till day was done and night came on dusky and dun;—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Ninety-ninth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the army of the Moslems held the cavern mouth and stood by its walls and they fended off the foe, and every one of the Infidels attempted to charge them, him they slew; and they patiently supported all such assaults till day was done and night came on dusky and dun, by which time King Sharrkan had only five and twenty men and no more left. Then quoth the Infidels to one another, ""When shall these battle days have an end? We are weary of warring the Moslems."" And quoth one of them, ""Up and at them, for there remain of them but five and twenty men! If we cannot prevail on them to fight, let us light a fire upon them;[FN#433] and if they submit themselves and yield to us, we will take them prisoners; but if they refuse we will leave them for fuel to the fire, so shall they become to men of foreseeing mind a warning dire. May the Messiah on their fathers have no grace, and may the sojourn of the Nazarenes be for them no abiding place!"" So they carried fuel to the jaws of the cavern and set fire to it. Thereupon Sharrkan and his companions made sure of perdition and yielded themselves prisoners. And while they were in this condition, lo! the knight their captain said to those who counselled their slaughter, ""It is not for any save for King Afridun to kill them, that he may gratify his wrath; therefore it behoveth us to keep them in durance by us till the morrow, when we will journey with them to Constantinople and deliver them to our King, who shall deal with them as he please."" Said they, ""This is the right course;"" and he commanded to pinion them and set guards over them. Then, as soon as it was black night, the Infidels busied themselves with feasting and making festival; and they called for wine and drank it till all fell upon their backs. Now Sharrkan and his brother, Zau al-Makan, were in confinement and so also were his companion knights; whereupon the elder turned to the younger brother and said to him, ""O my brother, how win free?"" ""By Allah,"" replied Zau al Makan, ""I know not; for here we be like birds in cage."" Then Sharrkan waxed wroth and sighed for excess of rage and stretched himself, till his pinion bonds brass asunder; whereupon being free he arose and went up to the Captain of the guard, and taking from his pocket the keys of the fetters, freed Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan and the rest of his men. Then he turned to the two and said, ""I desire to slay three of these Infidels and take and don their dress, we three; so that we shall be guised as Greeks and we will pass through them, with out their knowing us, and fare forth to our own force."" Replied Zau al-Makan, ""This is no safe counsel for if we kill them, I fear some of their comrades may hear their shrieks and the foe be aroused upon us and kill us. 'Twere the surer way to pass out of the defile."" So they agreed upon this and set out; and, when they had left the head of the strait a little distance behind, they saw horses picketed and the riders sleeping: and Sharrkan said to his brother, ""Better we take each one of us a steed."" There were five and twenty horsemen, so they took five and twenty horses, whilst Allah sent sleep upon the Infidels for a purpose He knew and the Faithful mounted and fared on till they were out of reach. Meanwhile Sharrkan set to gathering from the Infidels as many weapons, swords, and spears, as were wanted. And while they took saddle and struck forwards none of the Infidels supposed that anyone could release Zau al-Makan and his brother and their men; or that their prisoners had power to escape. Now when all the captives were safe from the Unfaithful, Sharrkan came up with his comrades, and found them awaiting his arrival, on coals of flame, expecting him in anxious grame, so he turned to them and said, ""Feel no fear since Allah protecteth us. I have that to propose which haply shall effect our purpose."" ""What is it?"" asked they and he answered, ""I desire that ye all climb to the mountain top and cry out with one voice, 'Allaho Akbar!' and ye add, 'The army of Al Islam is upon you! Allaho Akbar!' This wise their company will surely be dissolved nor will they find out the trick for they are drunk, but they will think that the Moslem troops have encompassed them about on all sides and have mingled with them; so they will fall on one another brand in hand during the confusion of drunkenness and sleep, and we will cleave them asunder with their own swords and the scymitar will go round amongst them till dawn."" Replied Zau al-Makan, ""This plan is not good; we should do better to make our way to our army and speak not a word; for if we cry out 'Allaho Akbar,' they will wake and fall on us and not one of us will escape."" Rejoined Sharrkan, ""By Allah, though they should awake tis no matter, and I long that ye fall in with my plan, for naught save good can come of it!"" So they agreed thereon and clomb the mountain and shouted, ""Allaho Akbar!"" And hills and trees and rocks reworded their Allaho Akbar for fear of the Almighty. But when the Kafirs heard this slogan they cried out to one another,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the One Hundredth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkan spake thus, ""I long that ye fall in with this my plan, for naught save good can come of it."" So they agreed thereon and clomb the mountain head and shouted, ""Allaho Akbar!""; and hills and trees and rocks re worded their Allaho Akbar for fear of the Almighty. The Infidels heard it and cried out one to other and donned their armour and said, ""The foe is upon us, by the truth of the Messiah!"" Then they fell on one another and slew of their own men more than any knoweth save Almighty Allah. As soon as it was dawn, they sought for the captives, but found no trace of them, and their captains said, ""They who did this were the prisoners in our possession; up, then, and after them in all haste till ye overtake them, when we will make them quaff the cup of requital; and let not fright nor the panic of sudden awaking possess you."" So they took horse and rode after the fugitives and it wanted but an eye twinkling before they overtook them and surrounded them. Now when Zau al-Makan saw this, he was seized with increase of terror and said to his brother, ""What I feared would come, is come upon us, and now it remaineth only for us to fight for the Faith."" But Sharrkan preferred to hold his peace. Then Zau al- Makan and his companions rushed down from the hill crest, shouting, ""Allaho Akbar!"" and his men repeated the war cry and addressed themselves to fight and to sell their lives in the service of the Lord of Faithful Men; and while they were in this case, behold, they heard many voices voicing, ""There is no god but the God! God is most great! Salutation and salvation upon the Apostle, the Bringer of glad Tidings, the Bearer of bad Tidings!''[FN#434] So they turned towards the direction of the sound and saw a company of Moslems who believed in one God, pushing towards them, whereat their hearts were heartened and Sharrkan charged upon the Infidels crying out, ""There is no god but the God! God is most great! he and those with him, so that earth quaked as with an earthquake and the Unbeliever host brake asunder and fled into the mountains and the Moslems followed them with lunge and blow; and Zau al-Makan and his comrades of the Moslems ceased not to smite the hosts of the Infidel foe, and parted heads from bodies till day darkened and night coming on starkened sight. Thereupon the Moslems drew together and passed the night in congratulations, and, when morning dawned and daybreak shone with its shine and sheen, they saw Bahram, the captain of the Daylamites, and Rustam, the captain of the Turks, advancing to join them, with twenty thousand cavaliers like lions grim. As soon as they saw Zau al-Makan, the riders dismounted and saluted him, and kissed ground between his hands when he said to them, ""Rejoice ye in the glad tidings of the victory of the Moslem and the discomfiture of the tribe of Unbelievers!"" Then they gave one another joy of their deliverance and of the greatness of their reward after Resurrection Day. Now the cause of the coming of the succours to that place was this. When the Emir Bahram and the Emir Rustam and the Chief Chamberlain, with the Moslem host and flags flaunting high ahead, came in sight of Constantinople they saw that the Nazarenes had mounted the walls and manned the towers and the forts, and had set all their defenders in order of defence, as soon as they learned of the approach of the host of Al-Islam and the banners Mohammedan, and they heard the clash of arms and the noise of war voices and tramp of horse hoofs and from their look outs they beheld the Moslems, with their standards and ensigns of the Faith of Unity under the dust clouds and lo! they were like a flight of locusts or rain clouds raining rain, and the voices of the Moslems chanting the Koran and glorifying the Compassionate One, struck their ears. Now the Infidels knew of the approach of this host through Zat al-Dawahi with her craft and whoredom,[FN#435] calumny and contrivance. And the armies of Al-Islam drew near, as it were the swollen sea, for the multitude of footmen and horsemen and women and children. Then quoth the General of the Turks to the General of the Daylamites, ""O Emir, of a truth, we are in jeopardy from the multitude of the foe who is on the walls. Look at yonder bulwarks and at this world of folk like the seas that clash with dashing billows. Indeed yon Infidel outnumbereth us an hundredfold and we cannot be safe from spies who may inform them that we are without a Sultan. In very sooth, we run danger from these enemies, whose numbers may not be told and whose resources none can withhold, especially in the absence of King Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and the illustrious Wazir Dandan. If they know of this, they will be emboldened to attack us in their absence and with the sword they will annihilate us to the last man; not one of us safety shall see. So it is my counsel that thou take ten thousand riders of the allies and the Turks, and march them to the hermitage of Matruhina and the meadow of Malúkhiná in quest of our brothers and comrades. If thou act by my advice, it may be we shall approve ourselves the cause of their deliverance, in case they be hard pressed by the Infidels; and if thou act not, blame will not attach to me. But, an ye go, it behoveth that ye return quickly, for ill suspicion is part of prudence."" The Emir aforesaid fell in with his counsel; so they chose twenty thousand horse and they set out covering the roads and making for the monastery above mentioned. So much for the cause of their coming; but as regards the ancient dame, Zat al-Dawahi, as soon as she had delivered Sultan Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and the Wazir Dandan into the hands of the Infidels, the foul whore mounted a swift steed, saying to the Faithless, ""I design to rejoin the Moslem army which is at Constantinople and contrive for their destruction; for I will inform them that their chiefs are dead, and when they hear that from me, their joining will be disjointed and the cord of their confederation cut and their host scattered. Then will I go to King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople, and to my son Hardub, King of Roum, and relate to them their tidings and they will sally forth on the Moslems with their troops and will destroy them and will not leave one of them alive."" So she mounted and struck across country on her good steed all the livelong night; and, when day dawned, appeared the armies of Bahram and Rustam advancing towards her. So she turned into a wayside brake and hid her horse among the trees and she walked a while saying to herself, ""Haply the Moslem hosts be returning, routed, from the assault of Constantinople."" However, as she drew near them she looked narrowly and made sure that their standards were not reversed,[FN#436] and she knew that they were coming not as conquered men, but fearing for their King and comrades. When she was assured of this, she hastened towards them, running at speed, like a devil of ill rede, till reaching them she cried out, ""Haste ye! haste ye! O soldiers of the Compassionate One, hasten to the Holy War against the hosts of Satan!"" When Bahram saw her he dismounted and kissed the ground before her and asked her, ""O friend of Allah what is behind thee?"" Answered she, ""Question not of sad case and sore condition; for when our comrades had taken the treasure from the hermitage of Matruhina, and designed to win their way Constantinople wards, thereupon came out on them a driving host and a dreadful of the Infidels."" And the damned witch repeated to them the story to fill them with trouble and terror, adding, ""The most of them are dead, and there are but five and twenty men left."" Said Bahram, ""O holy man! when didst thou leave them?"" ""But this night,""[FN#437] replied she. He cried, ""Glory be to Allah! to Him who hath rolled up the far distance for thee like a rug, so that thou hast sped thus walking upon thy feet and props upon a mid-rib of palm-tree! But thou art one of the saints which fly like birds when inspired and possessed by His directions.""[FN#438] Then he mounted his horse, and he was perplexed and confounded by what he had heard from the beldam so strong in lies and ill calumnies, and he said, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! Verily our labour is lost and our hearts are heavy within us, for our Sultan is a prisoner and those who are with him."" Then they cut across the country, wide and side, night and day, and when morning dawned they reached the head of the defile and saw Zau al-Makan and Sharrkan shouting. ""There is no god but the God! Allaho Akbar! and Salutation and Salvation upon the Congratulator, the Comminator.""[FN#439] Whereupon he and his drove at the Unbelievers and whelmed them, as the rain torrent whelms the waste; and cried out their war cries, till fear get hold of the prowess Knights and the mountains were cloven in affright. And when shone the day and showed its shine and sheen, the breeze of morning blew upon them sweet and fragrant, and each recognised other as hath been said before. Then they kissed the ground before the King and before his brother Sharrkan, who told them all that had befallen the party in the cave. Now thereat they marvelled and said to one another, ""Hasten we back to Constantinople, for we left our companions there, and our hearts are with them."" So they hurried departure, commending themselves to the Subtle, the All-wise, and Zau al-Makan exhorted the Moslems to steadfast- ness and versified in the following couplets,[FN#440]

""Be praises mine to all praiseworthy Thee, * O Lord, who stinted
            not mine aid to be!
Though was I lost abroad, Thou west to me * Strongest support
            which vouchsafed victory:
Thou gav'st me wealth and reign and goodly gifts, * And slungest
            con quering sword of valiancy:
Thou mad'st me blest beneath Thy kingly shade, * Engraced with
            generous boons dealt fain and free:
Thou savedst *from every fear I feared, by aid * Of my Wazir, the
            Age's noblest he!
Garred us Thy grace in fight to throw the Greek, * Who yet came
             back dight in War's cramoisie:
Then made I feint to fly from out the fight; * But like grim lion
           turning made them flee,
And left on valley sole my foemen, drunk * Not with old
           wine[FN#441] but Death-cup's revelry:
Then came the Saintly Hermit, and he showed * His marvels wrought
            for town and wold to see;
When slew they hero-wights who woke to dwell * In Eden bowers
           wherein sweet rill-lets well.""

But, when Zau al-Makan had made an end of versifying, his brother Sharrkan congratulated him on his safety and thanked him for the deeds he had done; after which both set out forcing their marches to rejoin their army.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the One Hundred and First Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkan congratulated his brother, Zau al-Makan, on his safety and thanked him for the deeds he had done; after which both set out forcing their marches to rejoin their army. Such was their case; but as regards the old woman, Zat al-Dawahi, after she had foregathered with the hosts of Rustam and Bahram, she returned to the coppice, where she took her steed and mounted and sped on at speed, till she drew near the Moslem army that beleaguered Constantinople, when she lighted down from her destrier and led it to the pavilion tent of the Chief Chamberlain. And when he saw her, he stood up to her in honour and signed to her with his right hand and said, ""Welcome O pious recluse!"" Then he questioned her of what had befallen, and she repeated to him her disquieting lies and deluding calumnies, saying, ""In sooth I fear for the Emir Rustam, and the Emir Bahram, for that I met them and theirs on the way and sent them and their following to relieve the King and his companions. Now there are but twenty thousand horse and the Unbelievers outnumber them; so I would have thee at this moment send off the rest of thy troops at full speed to their suc cour, lest they be slain to the last man."" And she cried to them, ""Haste! Haste!"" When the Chamberlain and the Moslems heard these words, their spirits fell and they wept; but Zat al-Dawahi said to them, ""Ask aidance of Allah and bear patiently this triburation; for ye have the example of those who have been before you of the people of Mohammed; and Paradise with its palaces is laid out by Allah for those who die martyrs; and needs must all die, but most praiseworthy is dying while fighting for the Faith."" The Chamberlain, hearing this speech of the accursed old woman, called for the Emir Bahram's brother, a knight by name Tarkash; and, choosing out for him ten thousand horse, riders famed for force, bade him set out at once. So he fared forth and marched all that day and the whole of the next night, till he neared the Moslems. When daylight dawned, Sharrkan saw the dust cloud about them and feared for the men of Al-Islam and said, ""If these troops which are coming upon us be Moslem men our victory is assured by them; but, if these be Nazarenes, there is no gainsaying Destiny's decrees."" Then he turned to his brother, Zau al- Makan, and said, Never fear, for with my life I will ransom thee from death. If these be Mohammedan troops, then were it an increase of heavenly favours; but, if they be our foes, there is no help save that we fight them. Yet do I long to meet the Holy Man ere I die, so I may beg him to pray that I die not save by death of martyrdom."" Whilst the twain were thus speaking, behold, there appeared the banners inscribed with the words, ""There is no god but the God and Mohammed is the Apostle of God;"" and Sharrkan cried out, ""How is it with the Moslems?"" ""All are sound and safe,"" replied they, ""and we came not but out of concern for you."" Then the Chief of the army dismounted and, kissing ground before Sharrkan, asked, ""O my lord, how be the Sultan and the Wazir Dandan and Rustam and my brother Bahram; are they all in safety?"" He answered, ""All well; but who brought thee tidings of us?"" Quoth Tarkash; ""It was the Holy Man who told us that he had met my brother Bahram and Rustam and had sent them both to you and he also assured us that the Infidels had encompassed you and out numbered you; but I see not the case save the contrary thereof and that you are victorious."" They questioned him, ""And how did the Holy Man reach you?""; and he replied, ""Walking on his feet and he had compassed in a day and a night, ten days' journey for a well girt horseman."" ""There is no doubt but that he is a Saint of Allah,"" said Sharrkan, ""but where is he now?"" They rejoined, ""We left him with our troops, the folk of the Faith, moving them to do battle with the rebels and the Faithless."" Thereat Sharrkan rejoiced and all thanked Allah for their own deliverance and the safety of the Holy Man; and commended the dead to His mercy saying, ""This was writ in the Book."" Then they set out making for Constantinople by forced marches, and whilst they were on this enterprise, behold, a dust cloud arose to such height that it walled the two horizons, the eastern and the western, from man's sight and the day was darkened by it to night. But Sharrkan looked at it and said, ""Verily, I fear lest this be the Infidels who have routed the army of Al-Islam for that this dust walleth the world, east and west, and hideth the two horizons, north and south."" Presently appeared under the dust a pillar of darkness, blacker than the blackness of dismal days; nor ceased to come upon them that column more dreadful than the dread of the Day of Doom. Horse and foot hastened up to look at it and know the terrors of the case, when behold, they saw it to be the recluse aforesaid; so they thronged round him to kiss his hands and he cried out, ""O people of the Best of Mankind,[FN#442] the lamp which shineth in darkness blind, verily the Infidels have outwitted the Moslems by guile, for they fell upon the host of the One God whilst they deemed themselves safe from the Faithless, and attacked them in their tents and made a sore slaughter of them what while they looked for no wile; so hasten to the aid of the Believers in the unity of God, and deliver them from those who deny Him!"" Now when Sharrkan heard these words, his heart flew from his breast with sore trouble; and, alighting from his steed in amazement, he kissed the Recluse's hands and feet. On like wise did his brother, Zau al-Makan, and the rest of the foot and horse troops; except the Wazir Dandan, who dismounted not but said, ""By Allah, my heart flieth from this devotee, for I never knew show of devotion to religion that bred not bane. So leave him and rejoin your comrades the Moslems, for this man is of the outcasts from the gate of the mercy of the Lord of the Three Worlds! How often have I here made razzias with King Omar bin al-Nu'uman and trodden the earth of these lands!"" Said Sharrkan, ""Put away from thee such evil thought, hast thou not seen this Holy Man exciting the Faithful to fight, and holding spears and swords light? So slander him not, for backbiting is blameable and poisoned is the flesh of the pious.[FN#443] Look how he inciteth us to fight the foe; and, did not Almighty Allah love him, He had cast him aforetime into fearful torment."" Then Sharrkan bade bring a Nubian mule for the ascetic to ride and said, ""Mount, O pious man, devout and virtuous!"" But the devotee refused to ride and feigned self denial, that he might attain his end; and they knew not that this holy personage was like him of whom the poet saith,

""He prayeth and he fasteth for an end he doth espy; * When once his end is safely won then fast and prayer good bye.""[FN#444]

So the devotee ceased not to walk among the horsemen and the footmen, like a wily fox meditating guile, and began to uplift her voice, chanting the Koran and praising the Compassionate One. And they continued pressing forward till they approached the camp of Al-Islam, where Sharrkan found the Moslem in conquered plight and the Chamberlain upon the brink of falling back in flight, whilst the sword of Greece havoc dight among the Faithful, the righteous and those who work upright,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the One Hundred and Second Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Sharrkan saw the Moslems in conquered plight and the Chamberlain upon the brink of retreat and flight and the sword havoc dight among the righteous and the workers of upright, the cause of this weakness among the Moslems was that the accursed old woman, Zat al- Dawahi, the foe of the Faith, after seeing that Bahram and Rustam had set forward with their troops to join Sharrkan and his brother Zau al-Makan, repaired to the camp of the Mahometans before Constantinople and caused the mission of the Emir Tarkash, as hath been before said. In this her purpose was to divide the Moslem forces the better to weaken them. Then she left them and entered Constantinople, and called with a loud voice on the knights of the Greeks, saying, ""Let me down a cord that I may tie thereto this letter, and do ye bear it to your King Afridun, that he may read it and to my son King Hardub that they both do what is written therein of bidding and forbidding."" So they let down for her a string and she tied thereto a letter whose purport was the following: ""From the terriblest of tribulations[FN#445] and the chiefest of all calamities, Zat al-Dawahi, to King Afridun greeting. But afterwards, of a truth I have contrived a device for destroying the Moslems; so bide ye quiet and content. I have cozened and captured their Sultan and the Wazir Dandan; and then I returned to their camp and acquainted them therewith, whereby their pride had a fall and their withers were wrung. And I have so wrought upon the host 'leaguering Constantinople that they have sent ten thousand men under the Emir Tarkash to succour the capitves, of whom there be now left but few; it is therefore my object that ye sally forth against them with all your power while this day endureth; and that ye fall on them in their tents and that ye leave them not till ye shall have slain them to the last man; for, verily the Messiah looketh down upon you and the Blessed Virgin favoureth you; and I hope of the Messiah that he forget not what deed I have done."" When her letter came to King Afridun, he rejoiced with great joyance; and, sending at once for King Hardub of Greece, son of Zat al-Dawahi, read the letter to him as soon as he came,whereathe was exceeding glad and said, ""See my mother's craft; verily it dispenseth with swords, and her aspect standeth in stead of the terrors of the Day of Dread."" Rejoined Afridun, ""May the Messiah not bereave us of thy venerable parent nor deprive her of her wile and guile!"" Then he bade the Knights give orders for sallying outside the city, and the news was noised abroad in Constantinople. So the Nazarenes and the cohorts of the Cross burst forth and unsheathed their keen sabres in their numbers, shouting out their professions of impiety and heresies, and blaspheming the Lord of all Creatures. When the Chamberlain saw the sally, he said, ""Behold, the Greek is upon us and they surely have learned that our Sultan is far away; and haply they have attacked us, for that the most part of our troops have marched to the succour of King Zau al-Makan!"" Therewith he waxed wroth and cried out, ""Ho, soldiers of Al-Islam and favourers of the True Faith, an you flee you are lost, but if ye stand fast, ye win! Know ye that valiancy lieth in endurance of outrance and that no case is so strait but that the Almighty is able to make it straight; Allah assain you and look upon you with eyes of compassion fain!"" Thereupon the Moslems cried out, ""Allaho Akbar!"" and the believer in the One God shouted his slogan, and whirled the mill wheels of fight with cutting and thrusting in main and might; scymitars and spears played sore and the plains and valleys were swamped with gore. The priests and monks priested it, tight girding their girdles and uplifting the Crucifixes, while the Moslem shouted out the professions of the Requiting King and verses of the Koran began to sing. The hosts of the Compassion are One fought against the legions of Satan; and head flew from body of man, while the good Angels hovered above the people of the Chosen Prophet, nor did the sword cease to smite till the day darkened and night came on and starkened. Now the miscreants had encompassed the Moslems and made sure of escaping the pains that awaited them; and the Faithless greeded for victory over the Faithful until day dawned and dazzled. There upon the Chamberlain mounted, he and his men, trusting thee Allah would help them to victory; and host was mingled with host and battle rose a foot and took post. And heads flew from trunks whilst the brave stood fast in stead; the craven turned tail and fled; and the Judge of death judged and sentence sped, so that the champions fell from their saddles slain and corpses cumbered meadow and plain. Then the Moslem began to give ground and rearwards bent; and the Greek took possession of some of their tents; whereupon the Moslems were about to break and retreat and take flight, when meanwhile behold, up came Sharrkan with the rest of the host of Al-Islam and the standards of the Believers in Unity. And having come up with them, he charged the Infidels; and followed him Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan and the Emirs Bahram and Rustam with his brother Tarkash. When the foe saw this, they lost head and their reason fled, and the dust clouds towered till they covered the country whilst the righteous Believers joined their pious comrades. Then Sharrkan accosted the Chamberlain and praised him for his steadfastness; and he in turn gave the Prince joy of his timely succour and his gaining the day. Thereat the Moslems were glad and their hearts were heartened; so they rushed upon their enemies and devoted themselves to Allah in their Fight for the Faith. But when the Idolaters beheld the standards Mohammedan and there on the profession of Faith Islamitan, proclaiming the Unity, they shrieked ""Woe!"" and ""Ruin!"" and besought succour of the Patriarchs of the Monasteries. Then fell they to calling upon John and Mary and the Cross abhorrent and stayed their hands from slaughter, whilst King Afridun went up to consult King Hardub of Greece, for the two Kings stood one at the head of each wing, right and left. Now there was with them also a famous cavalier, Lawiya highs, who commanded the centre; and they drew out in battle array, but indeed they were full of alarm and affray. Meanwhile, the Moslems aligned their forces and thereupon Sharrkan came to his brother, Zau al-Makan, and said, ""O King of the Age, doubtless they mean to champion it, and that is also the object of our desire; but it is my wish to push forward the stoutest hearted of our fighters, for by forethought is one half of life wrought."" Replied the Sultan, ""As thou wilt, O companion of good counsel!"" ""It is my wish,"" added Sharrkan, ""to stand in mid line opposite the Infidel, with the Wazir Dandan on my left and thee on my right, whilst the Emir Bahram leads the dexter wing and the Emir Rustam leads the wing sinistral; and thou, O mighty King, shalt be under the standards and the ensigns, for that thou art the pillar of our defence; upon thee, after Allah, is our dependence and we will all be thy ransom from aught that can harm thee."" Zau al-Makan thanked him therefor, and the slogan arose and the sabre was drawn; but, as things stood thus, behold, there came forth a cavalier from the ranks of Roum; and, as he drew near, they saw that he was mounted on a slow paced she mule, fleeing with her master from the shock of swords. Her housings were of white silk covered by a prayer-carpet of Cash mere stuff, and on her back sat a Shaykh, an old man of comely presence and reverend aspect, garbed in a gown of white wool. He stinted not pushing her and hurrying her on till he came near the Moslem and said, ""I am an ambassador to you all, and an ambassador hath naught to do save to deliver; so give me safe conduct and permit of speech, that I communicate to you my message."" Replied Sharrkan, ""Thou art in safety: fear neither sway of sword nor lunge of lance."" Thereupon the old man dismounted and, taking the Cross from his neck, placed it before the Sultan and humbled himself with much humility. Then quoth to him the Moslems, ""What is with thee of news?""; and quoth he, ""I am an ambassador from King Afridun, for I counselled him to avert the destruction of all these frames of men and temples of the Compassionate One; and to him it seemed righteous to stay the shedding of blood and limit it to the encounter of two knights in shock of fight singular; so he agreed to that and he saith to you, 'Verily, I will ransom my army with my life; so let the Moslem King do as I do and with his life ransom his host. And if he kill me, there will be no stay left in the army of Roum, and if I kill him, there will be no stability with the Moslems."" When Sharrkan heard this he said, ""O monk, I agree to that, for it is just nor may it be gainsaid; and behold, I will meet him in duello and do with him derring do, for I am Champion of the Faithful even as he is Champion of the Faithless; and if he slay me, he will have won the day and naught will remain for the Moslems forces save flight. So return to him, O thou monk, and say that the single combat shall take place to morrow, for this day we have come off our journey and are aweary; but after rest neither reproach nor blame fear ye."" So the monk returned (and he rejoicing) to King Afridun and King Hardub, and told them both what Sharrkan had said, whereat King Afridun was glad with exceeding gladness and fell from him anxiety and sadness, and he said to himself, ""No doubt but this Sharrkan is their doughtiest swayer of the sword and the dourest at lunge of lance; and when I shall have slain him, their hearts will be disheartened and their strength will be shattered."" Now Zat al-Dawahi had written to King Afridun of that and had told him how Sharrkan was a Knight of the Braves and the bravest of knights and had warned him against him; but Afridun was a stalwart cavalier who fought in many a fashion; he could hurl rocks and throw spears and smite with the iron mace and he feared not the prowess of the prow. So when he heard the report of the monk that Sharrkan agreed to the duello, he was like to fly for exceeding joy because he had self confidence and he knew that none could with stand him. The Infidels passed that night in joy and jubilee and wine bibbing; and, as soon as it was dawn, the two armies drew out with the swart of spear and the blanch of blade. And behold a cavalier rode single handed into the plain, mounted on a steed of purest strain, and for foray and fray full ready and fain. And that Knight had limbs of might and he was clad in an iron cuirass made for stress of fight. On his breast he wore a jewelled mirror and in his hand he bore a keen scymitar and his lance of Khalanj wood,[FN#446] the curious work of the Frank, weighing a quintal. Then the rider uncovered his face and cried out, saying, ""Whoso knoweth me verily hath enough of me, and whoso knoweth me not right soon[FN#447] shall ken who I be. I am Afridun the overwhelmed by the well omened Shawáhi,[FN#448] Zat al-Dawahi."" But he had not ended speaking ere Sharrkan, the Champion of the Moslems, fared forth to meet him, mounted on a sorrel horse worth a thousand pieces of red gold with accoutrements purfled in pearls and precious stone; and he bore in baldrick a blade of watered Indian steel that through necks shore and made easy the hard and sore. He crave his charger between the two hosts in line whilst the horsemen all fixed on him their eyne, and he cried out to Afridun, ""Woe to thee, O accursed! dost thou deem me one of the horsemen thou hast overta'en who cannot stand against thee on battle plain?"" Then each rushed upon other and they bashed together like two mountains crashing or two billows dash ing and clashing: they advanced and retreated; and drew together and withdrew; and stinted not of fray and fight and weapon play, and strife and stay, with stroke of sword and lunge of lance. Of the two armies looking on, some said, ""Sharrkan is victor!"" and others, ""Afridun will conquer!""; and the two riders stayed not their hands from the hustle until ceased the clamour and the bustle; and the dust columns rose and the day waned and the sun waxed yellow and wan. Then cried out King Afridun to Sharrkan, saying, ""By the truth of the Messiah and the Faith which is no liar, thou art nought save a doughty rider and a stalwart fighter; but thou art fraudful and thy nature is not that of the noble. I ken thy work is other than praiseworthy nor is thy prowess that of a Prince; for thy people behave to thee as though thou wert a slave;[FN#449] and see! they bring thee out a charger which is not thine, that thou mayst mount and return to the fight. But by the truth of my Faith, thy fighting irketh and fatigueth me and I am weary of cutting and thrusting with thee; and if thou purpose to lay on load with me to night, thou wouldst not change aught of thy harness nor thy horse, till thou approve to the cavaliers, thy generous blood and skill in brunt."" When Sharrkan heard him say these words concerning his own folk behaving to him though he were a slave, he waxt wroth and turned towards his men, meaning to sign to them and bid them not prepare him change of harness or horse, when lo! Afridun shook his throw spear high in air and cast it at Sharrkan. Now when the Moslem turned his back, he found none of the men near him, and he knew this to be a trick of the accursed Infidel; so he wheeled round in haste and behold, the javelin came at him, so he swerved from it, till his head was bent low as his saddle bow. The weapon grazed his breast, and pierced the skin of his chest, for Sharrkan was high bosomed: whereupon he gave one cry and swooned away. Thereat the accursed Afridun was joyful, thinking he had slain him; and shouted to the Infidels bidding them rejoice, whereat the Faithless were encouraged and the Faithful wept. When Zau al-Makan saw his brother reeling in selle so that he well nigh fell, he despatched cavaliers towards him and the braves hurried to his aid and came up with him. Thereupon the Infidels drove at the Moslems; the two hosts joined battle and the two lines were mingled, whilst the keen scymitar of Al-Yaman did good work. Now the first to reach Sharrkan was the Wazir Dandan,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the One Hundred and Third Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Zau al-Makan saw that the accursed Infidel had struck with javelin his brother Sharrkan, he deemed him dead, and despatched cavaliers towards him; and the first to reach him were the Wazir Dandan and the Emir of the Turks, Bahram, and the Emir of the Daylamites, Rustam. They found him falling from his horse; so they stayed him in his saddle and returned with him to his brother, Zau al-Makan; then they gave him in charge to his pages, and went again to do the work of cut and thrust. So the strife redoubled and the weapons together clashed and ceased not bate and debate and naught was to be seen but blood flowing and necks bowing; nor did the swords cease on the napes of men to make play nor the strife to rage with more and more affray, till the most part of the night was past away and the two hosts were aweary of the mellay. So they called a truce and each army returned to its tents, whilst all the Infidels repaired to King Afridun and kissed the ground before him, and the priests and monks wished him joy of his victory over Sharrkan. Then the King fared for Constantinople and sat upon the throne of his realm, when King Hardub came to him and said, ""May the Messiah strengthen thy fore arm and never cease to be thy helper and hearken to what prayers my pious mother, Zat al-Dawahi, shall pray for thee! Know that the Moslems can make no stay without Sharrkan."" Replied Afridun, ""To morrow shall end the affair when to fight I fare: I will seek Zau al-Makan and slay him, and their army shall turn tail and of flight shall avail."" Such was the case with the Kafirs; but as regards the host of Al-Islam, when Zau al-Makan returned to his tent, he thought of naught but his brother and, going into the pavilion, found him in evil case and sore condition; whereupon he summoned for counsel the Wazir Dandan and Rustam and Bahram. When they entered, they opined to assemble the physicians that they might medicine Sharrkan, and they wept and said, ""The world will not readily afford his like!"" and they watched by him all that night, and about the later hours came to them the Recluse in tears. When Zau al-Makan saw him, he rose in honour; and the Religious stroked Sharrkan's wound with his hand, chanting somewhat of the Koran and repeating by way of talisman some of the verses of the Compassionate One. And the pretender ceased not to watch over him till dawn, when he came to himself and, opening his eyes, moved his tongue in his mouth and spake. At this Zau al-Makan rejoiced, saying, ""Of a truth the blessing of the Holy Man hath taken effect on him!"" And Sharrkan said, ""Praised be Allah for recovery; indeed, I am well at this hour. That accursed one played me false; and, but that I swerved aside lighter than lightening, the throw spear had pierced through my breast. So praised be Allah for saving me! And how is it with the Moslems?"" Answered Zau al-Makan, ""All are weeping for thee."" Quoth Sharrkan, ""I am well and in good case; but where is the Holy Man?"" Now he was sitting by him and said, ""At thy head."" So the Prince turned to him and kissed his hand when he said, ""O my son! Be of good patience and Allah shall increase thy reward; for the wage is measured by the work."" Sharrkan rejoined, ""Pray for me,"" and he prayed for him. As soon as morning dawned and day brake in shine and sheen, the Moslems sallied out to the plain and the Kafirs made ready to thrust and cut. Then the Islamite host advanced and offered fight with weapons ready dight, and King Zau al-Makan and Afridun made to charge one at other. But when Zau al-Makan fared forth into the field, there came with him the Wazir Dandan and the Chamberlain and Bahram, saying, ""We will be thy sacrifice."" He replied, ""By the Holy House and Zemzem and the Place![FN#450] I will not be stayed from going forth against these wild asses."" And when he rode out into the field he played with sword and spear till riders marvelled and both armies wondered; then he rushed upon the foe's right wing and of it slew two knights and in like manner he dealt with the left wing. Presently he stayed his steed in the midst of the field and cried out, ""Where is Afridun, that I may make him taste the cup of disgrace?"" But when King Hardub saw the case he conjured Afridun not to attack him, saying, ""O King, yesterday it was thy turn to fight: it is mine to day. I care naught for his prowess."" So he rushed out towards Zau al-Makan brand in hand and under him a stallion like Abjar, which was Antar's charger and its coat was jet black even as saith the poet,

""On the glancing racer outracing glance * He speeds, as though he
            would collar Doom:
His steed's black coat is of darkest jet, * And likest Night in
            her nightliest gloom:
Whose neigh sounds glad to the hearer's ears * Like thunders
             rolling in thun d'rous boom:
If he race the wind he will lead the way, * And the lightning
             flash will behind him loom.''[FN#451]

Then each rushed upon the opponent, parrying blows and proving the marvellous qualities were stored in him; and they fell to drawing on and withdrawing till the breasts of the bystanders were straitened and they were weary of waiting for the event. At last Zau al-Makan cried out his war cry and rushed upon Hardub, King of Cæsarea,[FN#452] and struck him a stroke that shore head from trunk and slew him on the spot. When the Infidels saw this, they charged in a body, compact and united, upon Zau al-Makan, who met them amidfield, and they engaged in hewing and foining, till blood ran in rills. Then the Moslems cried out, ""Allaho Akbar!"" (God is most Great) and ""There is no god but the God!"", and invoked salvation for the Prophet, the Bringer of Glad Tidings, the Bearer of Bad Tidings. And there befel a great fight, but Allah assigned victory to the Faithful and defeat to the Faithless. The Wazir Dandan shouted, ""Take your blood revenge for King Omar bin al Nu'uman and his son Sharrkan!""; and bared his head and cried out to the Turks. Now there were by his side more than twenty thousand horse, and all charged with him as men, when the Faithless found naught to save their lives but flight. So they turned tail to fly while the biting sabre wrought its havoc and the Moslems slew of them that day some fifty thousand horse and took more than that number: much folk also were slain while going in at the gates, for the flock was great. Then the Greeks hove to the doors and swarmed up the walls to await the assault; and in fine the Moslem hosts returned to their tents aided to glory and victory, and King Zau al-Makan went in to his brother whom he found in most joyous case. So he made a prostration of thanks to the Bountiful and the Exalted; and then he came forward and gave Sharrkan joy of his recovery. Answered he, ""Verily we are all under the benediction of this Religious, holy and righteous, nor would you have been victorious, but for his accepted orisons; indeed all day he remained at prayer to invoke victory on the Moslems.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the One Hundred and Fourth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Zau al- Makan went in to his brother Sharrkan, he found him sitting with the Holy Man by his side; so he rejoiced and drew near him and gave him joy of his recovery. Answered he, ""Verily we are all under the benediction of this Recluse nor would you have been victorious but for his prayers, indeed he felt no fear this day and he ceased not supplication for the Moslems. I found strength return to me, when I heard your 'Allaho Akbar,' for then I knew you to be victorious over your enemies. But now recount to me, O my brother, what befel thee."" So he told him all that had passed between him and the accursed Hardub and related how he had slain him and sent him to the malediction of Allah; and Sharrkan praised him and thanked him for his prowess. When Zat al-Dawahi heard tell of her son's death (and she still drest as a devotee), her face waxed yellow and her eyes ran over with railing tears: she kept her counsel, however, and feigned to the Moslems that she was glad and wept for excess of joy. But she said to herself, ""By the truth of the Messiah, there remaineth no profit of my life, if I burn not his heart for his brother, Sharrkan, even as he hath burned my heart for King Hardub, the mainstay of Christendom and the hosts of Crossdom!"" Still she kept her secret. And the Wazir Dandan and King Zau al-Makan and the Chamberlain remained sitting with Sharrkan till they had dressed and salved his wound; after which they gave him medicines and he began to recover strength; whereat they joyed with exceeding joy and told the troops who congratulated themselves, saying, ""To morrow he will ride with us and do manly devoir in the siege."" Then said Sharrkan to them, ""Ye have fought through all this day and are aweary of fight; so it behoveth that you return to your places and sleep and not sit up."" They accepted his counsel and then each went away to his own pavilion, and none remained with Sharrkan but a few servants and the old woman Zat al-Dawahi. He talked with her through part of the night, then he stretched himself to rest: and his servants did likewise and presently sleep overcame them all and they lay like the dead. Such was the case with Sharrkan and his men; but as regards the old woman she alone abode awake while they slumbered in the tent and, looking at Sharrkan she presently saw that he was drowned in sleep. Thereupon she sprang to her feet, as she were a scald she bear or a speckled snake, and drew from her waist cloth a dagger so poisoned that if laid thereon it would have melted a rock. Then she unsheathed the poniard and went up to Sharrkan's head and she drew the knife across his throat and severed his weasand and hewed off his head from his body. And once more she sprang to her feet; and, going the round of the sleeping servants, she cut off their heads also, lest they should awake. Then she left the tent and made for the Sultan's pavilion, but finding the guards on the alert, turned to that of the Wazir Dandan. Now she found him reading the Koran and when his sight fell upon her he said, ""Welcome to the Holy Man!"" Hearing this from the Wazir, her heart trembled and she said, ""The reason of my coming hither at this time is that I heard the voice of a saint amongst Allah's Saints and am going to him."" Then she turned her back, but the Wazir said to himself, ""By Allah, I will follow our Devotee this night!"" So he rose and walked after her; but when the accursed old woman sensed his footsteps, she knew that he was following her: wherefore she feared the disgrace of discovery and said in herself, ""Unless I serve some trick upon him he will disgrace me."" So she turned and said to him from afar, ""Ho, thou Wazir, I am going in search of this Saint that I may learn who he is; and, after learning this much, I will ask his leave for thee to visit him. Then I will come back and tell thee: for I fear thine accompanying me, without having his permission, lest he take umbrage at me seeing thee in my society."" Now when the Wazir heard these words, he was ashamed to answer her; so he left her and returned to his tent, and would have slept; but sleep was not favourable to him and the world seemed heaped upon him. Presently he rose and went forth from the tent saying in himself, ""I will go to Sharrkan and chat with him till morning."" But when he entered into Sharrkan's pavilion, he found the blood running like an aqueduct and saw the servants lying with their throats cut like beasts for food. At this he cried a cry which aroused all who were asleep; the folk hastened to him and, seeing the blood streaming, set up a clamour of weeping and wailing. Then the noise awoke the Sultan, who enquired what was the matter, and it was said to him, ""Sharrkan thy brother and his servants are murthered."" So he rose in haste and entered the tent, and found the Wazir Dandan shrieking aloud and he saw his brother's body without a head. Thereat he swooned away and all the troops crowded around him, weeping and crying out, and so remained for a while, till he came to himself, when he looked at Sharrkan and wept with sore weeping, while the Wazir and Rustam and Bahram did the like. But the Chamberlain cried and lamented more than the rest and asked leave to absent himself, such was his alarm. Then said Zau al-Makan, ""Know ye who did this deed and how is it I see not the Devotee, him who the things of this world hath put away?"" Quoth the Wazir, ""And who should have been the cause of this affliction, save that Devotee, that Satan? By Allah, my heart abhorred him from the first, because I know that all who pretend to be absorbed in practices religious are vile and treacherous!"" And he repeated to the King the tale of how he would have followed the Religious, but he forbade him, whereupon the folk broke out into a tumult of weeping and lamentation and humbled themselves before Him who is ever near, Him who ever answereth prayer, supplicating that He would cause the false Devotee who denied Allah's testimony to fall into their hands. Then they laid Sharrken out and buried him in the mountain aforesaid and mourned over his far-famed virtues.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the One Hundred and Fifth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that they laid Sharrkan out and buried him in the mountain aforesaid and mourned over his far-famed virtues. Then they looked for the opening of the city gate; but it opened not and no sign of men appeared to them on the walls; whereat they wondered with exceeding wonder. But King Zau al-Makan said, ""By Allah, I will not turn back from them, though I sit here for years and years, till I take blood revenge for my brother Sharrkan and waste Constantinople and kill the King of the Nazarenes, even if death overcome me and I be at rest from this woeful world!"" Then he bade be brought out the treasure taken from the Monastery of Matruhina; and mustered the troops and divided the monies among them, and he left not one of them but he gave him gifts which contented him. Moreover, he assembled in the presence three hundred horse of every division and said to them, ""Do ye send supplies to your households, for I am resolved to abide by this city, year after year, till I have taken man bote for my brother Sharrkan, even if I die in this stead."" And when the army heard these words and had received his gifts of money they replied, ""To hear is to obey!"" Thereupon he summoned couriers and gave them letters and charged them to deliver the same, together with the monies, to the soldiers' families and inform them that all were safe and satisfied, and acquaint them saying, ""We are encamped before Constantinople and we will either destroy it or die; and, albeit we be obliged to abide here months and years, we will not depart hence till we take it."" Moreover, he bade the Wazir Dandan write to his sister, Nuzhat al-Zaman, and said to him, ""Acquaint her with what hath befallen us, and what be our situation and commend my child to her care since that, when I went out to war, my wife was near her delivery and by this time she must needs have been brought to bed; and if she hath given birth to a boy, as I have heard say, hasten your return and bring me the acceptable news."" Then he gave them somewhat of money, which they pouched and set out at once; and all the people flocked forth to take leave of them and entrust them with the monies and the messages. After they had departed, Zau al-Makan turned to the Wazir Dandan and commanded him to advance with the army against the city walls. So the troops pushed forward, but found none on the ramparts, whereat they marvelled, while Zau al-Makan was troubled at the case, for he deeply mourned the severance from his brother Sharrkan and he was sore perturbed about that traitor the Ascetic. In this condition they abode three days without seeing anyone. So far concerning the Moslems; but as regards the Greeks and the cause of their refusing to fight during these three days the case was this. As soon as Zat al-Dawahi had slain Sharrkan, she hastened her march and reached the walls of Constantinople, where she called out in the Greek tongue to the guards to throw her down a rope. Quoth they, ""Who art thou?""; and quoth she, ""I am Zat al- Dawahi."" They knew her and let down a cord to which she tied herself and they drew her up; and, when inside the city, she went in to the King Afridun and said to him, ""What is this I hear from the Moslems? They say that my son King Hardub is slain."" He answered, ""Yes;"" and she shrieked out and wept right grievously and ceased not weeping thus till she made Afridun and all who were present weep with her. Then she told the King how she had slain Sharrkan and thirty of his servants, whereat he rejoiced and thanked her; and, kissing her hands, exhorted her to resignation for the loss of her son. Said she, ""By the truth of the Messiah, I will not rest content with killing that dog of the Moslem dogs in blood revenge for my son, a King of the Kings of the age! Now there is no help for it but that I work some guile and I contrive a wile whereby to slay the Sultan Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan and the Chamberlain and Rustam and Bahram and ten thousand cavaliers of the army of Al-Islam; for it shall never be said that my son's head be paid with the bloodwit of Sharrkan's head; no, never!"" Then said she to King Afridun, ""Know, O King of the Age, that it is my wish to set forth mourning for my son and to cut my Girdle and to break the Crosses."" Replied Afridun, ""Do what thou desire; I will not gainsay thee in aught. And if thou prolong thy mourning for many days it were a little thing; for though the Moslems resolve to beleaguer us years and years, they will never win their will of us nor gain aught of us save trouble and weariness."" Then the Accursed One (when she had ended with the calamity she had wrought and the ignominies which in herself she had thought) took ink case and paper and wrote thereon: ""From Shawahi, Zat al- Dawahi, to the host of the Moslems. Know ye that I entered your country and duped by my cunning your nobles and at first hand I slew your King Omar bin al-Nu'uman in the midst of his palace. Moreover, I slew, in the affair of the mountain pass and of the cave, many of your men; and the last I killed were Sharrkan and his servants. And if fortune do not stay me and Satan obey me, I needs must slay me your Sultan and the Wazir Dandan, for I am she who came to you in disguise of a Recluse and who heaped upon you my devices and deceits. Wherefore, an you would be in safety after this, fare ye forth at once; and if you seek your own destruction cease not abiding for the nonce; and though ye tarry here years and years, ye shall not do your desire on us. And so peace be yours!"" After writing her writ she devoted three days to mourning for King Hardub; arid, on the fourth, she called a Knight and bade him take the letter and make it fast to a shaft and shoot it into the Moslem camp. When this was done, she entered the church and gave herself up to weeping and wailing for the loss of her son, saying to him who took the kingship after him, ""Nothing will serve me but I must kill Zau al-Makan and all the nobles of Al-Islam."" Such was the case with her; but as regards what occurred to the Moslems, all passed three days in trouble and anxiety, and on the fourth when gazing at the walls behold, they saw a knight holding a bow and about to shoot an arrow along whose side a letter was bound. So they waited till he had shot it among them and the Sultan bade the Wazir Dandan take the missive and read it. He perused it accordingly; and, when Zau al-Makan heard it to end and understood its purport, his eyes filled with tears and he shrieked for agony at her perfidy; and the Minister Dandan said, ""By Allah, my heart shrank from her!"" Quoth the Sultan, ""How could this whore play her tricks upon us twice? But by the Almighty I will not depart hence till I fill her cleft with molten lead and jail her with the jailing of a bird encaged, then bind her with her own hair and crucify her over the gate of Constantinople."" And he called to mind his brother and wept with excessive weeping. But when Zat al-Dawahi arrived amongst the Infidels and related to them her adventures at length, they rejoiced at her safety and at the slaying of Sharrkan. There upon the Moslems addressed themselves again to the siege of the city and the Sultan promised his men that, if it should be taken, he would divide its treasures among them in equal parts. But he dried not his tears grieving for his brother till his body was wasted and sick, growing thin as a tooth pick. Presently the Wazir Dandan came in to him and said, ""Be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear; in very sooth thy brother died not but because his hour was come, and there is no profit in this mourning. How well saith the poet,

""Whatso is not to be no sleight shall bring to pass; * What is to
             be without a failure shall become;
Soon the becoming fortune shall be found to be, * And Folly's
             brother[FN#453] shall abide forlorn and glum.""

Wherefore do thou leave this weeping and wailing and hearten thy heart to bear arms."" He replied, ""O Wazir, my heart is heavy for the death of my father and my brother and for our absence from hearth and home; and my mind is concerned for my subjects."" Thereupon the Wazir and the bystanders wept; but they ceased not from pushing forward the siege of Constantinople for a length of days. And they being thus, behold, news arrived from Baghdad, by one of the Emirs to the effect that the King's wife had been blessed with a boy, and that his sister, Nuzhat al-Zaman, had named him Kánmákán.[FN#454] Moreover, that the boy bid fair to be famous, already showing wondrous signs and marvellous tokens; and that she had commanded the Olema and the preachers to pray for mother and child from the pulpits and bless them in all wise; furthermore that the twain were well, that the land had enjoyed abundant rains, and that his comrade the Fireman was established in all prosperity, with eunuchs and slaves to wait upon him; but that he was still ignorant of what had befallen him. And she ended with the greeting of peace. Then quoth Zau al- Makan to the Wazir Dandan, ""Now is my back strengthened for that I have been blest with a son whose name is Kanmakan.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the One Hundred and Sixth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when they brought him the news of his wife having borne him a boy child, Zau al- Makan rejoiced with great joy and cried, ""Now is my back strengthened, for that I have been blessed with a son[FN#455] whose name is Kanmakan."" And he spake to the Wazir Dandan, saying, ""I am minded to leave this mourning and order perfections of the Koran for my brother and command almsdeeds on his account."" Quoth the Wazir, ""Thy design is good."" Thereupon he caused tents to be pitched over his brother's tomb; so they raised them and gathered together such of the men at arms as could repeat the Koran; and some began reciting the Holy volume; whilst others chanted litanies containing the names of Allah, and thus they did till the morning. Then Zau al-Makan went up to the grave of his brother Sharrkan and poured forth copious tears, and improvised these couplets,

""They bore him bier'd, and all who followed wept * With Moses'
         shrieks what day o'erhead shook Tor;[FN#456]
Till reached the grave which Pate had made his home, * Dug in
           men's souls who one sole God adore:
Ne'er had I thought before to see my joy * Borne on the bier
           which heads of bearers bore:
Ah no! nor ere they homed thee in the dust * That stars of
           heaven earth ever covered o'er.
Is the tomb dweller hostage of a stead, * Where light and
            splendour o'er thy face shall pour?
Praise to restore his life her word hath pledged: * Cribbed and
           confined he shall dispread the more!""

When Zau al-Makan had made an end of his versifying he wept and wept with him all the troops; then he came to the grave and threw himself upon it wild with woe, and the Wazir repeated the words of the poet,

""Pain leaving life that fleets thou hast th' eternal won; * Thou
            didst as whilom many a doer like thee hath done
Leftest this worldly house without reproach or blame; * Ah, may
            th' ex change secure thee every benison!
Thou west from hostile onset shield and firm defence, * For us to
            baffle shafts and whistling spears to shun.
I see this world is only cheat and vanity, * Where man naught
           else must seek but please the Truthful One:
Th' Empyrean's Lord allow thee bower of heavenly bliss, * And wi'
            thy faithful friends The Guide show goodly wone:
I bid thee last good e'en with sigh of bitter grief, * Seeing the
             West in woe for lack of Easting Sun.""


When the Wazir Dandan had finished his reciting, he wept with sore weeping and the tears rained from his eyes like cushioned pearls. Then came forward one who had been of Sharrkan's boon companions in his cups and he wept till ran in rills the drops, and he enumerated the dead man's generous qualities, reciting the following pentastichs,


""Where gone is Bounty since thy hand is turned to clay? * And I
             in misery lie since thou west ta'en away.
See'st not, O litter guide[FN#457] (Heaven keep thee glad and
             gay!), * How tears adorn my cheeks, these furrowed wrinkles
             fray?
                        A sight to joy shine eyes and fill thee with
                        dismay.[FN#458]
By Allah ne'er this heart within I spoke of thee; * Ah no! nor
             dared my sight to see thy brilliancy:
Save that my tear drops sorest wound have garred me dree * Yea!
             and if e'er on other rest these eyne of me,
                        May yearning draw their reins nor suffer sleep to see.""


And when the man stinted reciting, Zau al-Makan and the Minister Dandan wept and the whole army was moved to tears; after which all retired to their tents, and the King turning to the Wazir took counsel with him concerning the conduct of the campaign. On this wise the two passed days and nights, while Zau al-Makan was weighed down with grief and mourning till at last he said, ""I long to hear stories and adventures of Kings and tales of lover folk enslaved by love; haply Allah may make this to solace that which is on my heart of heavy anxiety, and stint and stay my weeping and wailing."" Quoth the Wazir, ""If naught can dispel thy trouble but hearing curious tales of Kings and people long gone before and stories of folk enslaved by love of yore, and so forth, this thing were easy, for I had no other business, in the lifetime of thy father (who hath found mercy) than to relate stories and to repeat verses to him. This very night I will tell thee a tale of a lover and his beloved, so shall thy breast be broadened."" When Zau al-Makan heard these words from the Minister, his heart was set upon that which had been promised to him and he did nothing but watch for the coming of the night, that he might hear what the Wazir Dandan had to tell of the Kings of yore and distracted lovers long gone before. And hardly would he believe that night had fallen ere he bade light the wax candles and the lamps and bring all that was needful of meat and drink and perfume gear, and what not; and when all was in presence, he summoned the Wazir Dandan, and the Emirs Rustam and Bahram and Tarkash and the Grand Chamberlain; then waited till the whole party was seated before him; whereupon he turned to the Minister and said, ""Know, O Wazir, that night is come and hath let down over us its veil of gloom, and we desire that thou tell us those tales which thou promisedst us."" Replied the Wazir, ""With joy and good will.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the One Hundred and Seventh Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Zau Al-Makan summoned the Wazir and the Chamberlain and Rustam and Bahram, he turned towards the Minister Dandan and said, ""Know, O Wazir, that night is come and hath let down over us its veil of gloom, and we desire that thou tell us those tales which thou promisedst us."" Replied the Wazir, ""With love and gladness! Know, O auspicious King, that there reached my ears a relation of a lover and a loved one and of the discourse between them and what befel them of things rare and fair, a story such as repelleth care from the heart and dispelleth sorrow like unto that of the patriarch Jacob[FN#459]; and it is as follows"":

Footnotes:


[FN#138] This knightly tale, the longest in the Nights (xliv.— cxlv.), about one-eighth of the whole, does not appear in the Bres. Edit. Lane, who finds it ""objectionable,"" reduces it to two of its episodes, Azíz-cum-Azízah and Táj al-Mulúk. On the other hand it has been converted into a volume (8vo, pp. 240) ""Scharkan, Conte Arabe,"" etc. Traduit par M. Asselan Riche, etc. Paris: Dondey-Dupré. 1829. It has its longueurs and at times is longsome enough; but it is interesting as a comparison between the chivalry of Al-Islam and European knight-errantry. Although all the characters are fictitious the period is evidently in the early crusading days. Cæsarea, the second capital of Palestine, taken during the Caliphate of Omar (A.H. 19) and afterwards recovered, was fortified in A.H. 353 = 963 as a base against the Arabs by the Emperor Phocas, the Arab. ""Nakfúr"" i.e. Nicephorus. In A.H. 498=1104, crusading craft did much injury by plundering merchantmen between Egypt and Syria, to which allusion is found in the romance. But the story teller has not quite made up his mind about which Cæsarea he is talking, and M. Riche tells us that Césarée is a ""ville de la Mauritanie, en Afrique"" (p. 20).

[FN#139] The fifth Ommiade Caliph reign. A.H. 65-86 = 685-704.

[FN#140] This does not merely mean that no one was safe from his wrath: or, could approach him in the heat of fight: it is a reminiscence of the masterful ""King Kulayb,"" who established game-laws in his dominions and would allow no man to approach his camp-fire. Moreover the Jinn lights a fire to decoy travellers, but if his victim be bold enough to brave him, he invites him to take advantage of the heat.

[FN#141] China.

[FN#142] The Jaxartes and the Bactrus (names very loosely applied).

[FN#143] In full ""Sharrun kána"" i.e. an evil (Sharr) has come to being (kána) that is, ""bane to the foe"" a pagan and knightly name. The hero of the Romance ""Al-Dalhamah"" is described as a bitter gourd (colocynth), a viper, a calamity.

[FN#144] This is a Moslem law (Koran chaps. iv. bodily borrowed from the Talmud) which does not allow a man to marry one wife unless he can carnally satisfy her. Moreover he must distribute his honours equally and each wife has a right to her night unless she herself give it up. This was the case even with the spouses of the Prophet; and his biography notices several occasions when his wives waived their rights in favour of one another M. Riche kindly provides the King with la piquante francaise (p. 15).

[FN#145] So the celebrated mosque in Stambul, famed for being the largest church in the world is known to the Greeks as ""Agia (pron. Aya) Sophia"" and to Moslems as ""Aye Sofíyeh"" (Holy Wisdom) i.e. the Logos or Second Person of the Trinity (not a Saintess). The sending a Christian girl as a present to a Moslem would, in these days, be considered highly scandalous. But it was done by the Mukaukis or Coptic Governor of Egypt (under Heraclius) who of course hated the Greeks. This worthy gave two damsels to Mohammed; one called Sírín and the other Máriyah (Maria) whom the Prophet reserved for his especial use and whose abode is still shown at Al-Medinah. The Rev. Doctor Badger (loc. cit. p. 972) gives the translation of an epistle by Mohammed to this Mukaukis, written in the Cufic character ( ? ?) and sealed ""Mohammed, The Apostle of Allah."" My friend seems to believe that it is an original, but upon this subject opinions will differ. It is, however, exceedingly interesting, beginning with ""Bismillah,"" etc., and ending (before the signature) with a quotation from the Koran (iii. 57); and it may be assumed as a formula addressee to foreign potentates by a Prophet who had become virtually ""King of Arabia.""

[FN#146] This prayer before ""doing the deed of kind"" is, I have said, Moslem as well Christian.

[FN#147] Exodus i. 16, quoted by Lane (M. E., chaps. xxvii.).
Torrens in his Notes cites Drayton's ""Moon-calf':—
            Bring forth the birth-stool—no, let it alone;
            She is so far beyond all compass grown,
            Some other new device us needs must stead,
            Or else she never can be brought to bed.
It is the ""groaning-chair"" of Poor Robin's Almanac (1676) and we find it alluded to in Boccaccio, the classical sedile which according to scoffers has formed the papal chair (a curule seat) ever since the days of Pope Joan, when it has been held advisable for one of the Cardinals to ascertain that His Holiness possesses all the instruments of virility. This ""Kursí al-wiládah"" is of peculiar form on which the patient is seated. A most interesting essay might be written upon the various positions preferred during delivery, e.g. the wild Irish still stand on all fours, like the so-called ""lower animals."" Amongst the Moslems of Waday, etc., a cord is hung from the top of the hut, and the woman in labour holds on to it standing with her legs apart, till the midwife receives the child.

[FN#148] Some Orientalists call ""lullilooing"" the trilling cry, which is made by raising the voice to its highest pitch and breaking it by a rapid succession of touches on the palate with the tongue-tip, others ""Ziraleet"" and Zagaleet, and one traveller tells us that it began at the marriage-festival of Isaac and Rebecca (!). Arabs term it classically ""Tahlíl"" and vulgarly ""Zaghrutah"" (Plur. Zaghárit) and Persians ""Kil."" Finally in Don Quixote we have ""Lelilies,"" the battle-cry of the Moors (Duffield iii. 289). Dr. Buchanan likens it to a serpent uttering human sounds, but the good missionary heard it at the festival of Jagannath. (Pilgrimage iii. 197 )

[FN#149] i.e. ""Light of the Place"" (or kingdom) and ""Delight of the
Age.""

[FN#150] It is utterly absurd to give the old heroic Persian name Afridun or Furaydun, the destroyer of Zohák or Zahhák to a Greek, but such anachronisms are characteristic of The Nights and are evidently introduced on purpose. See Boccaccio, ix. 9.

[FN#151] Arab. ""Yunán"" lit. Ionia, which applies to all Greece, insular and continental, especially to ancient Greece.

[FN#152] In 1870 I saw at Sidon a find of some hundreds of gold
""Philippi"" and ""Alexanders.""

[FN#153] M. Riche has (p. 21), ""Ces talismans travaillés par le ciseau du célèbre Califaziri,"" adding in a note, ""Je pense que c'est un sculpteur Arabe.""

[FN#154] This periphrase, containing what seems to us a useless negative, adds emphasis in Arabic.

[FN#155] This bit of geographical information is not in the Bull
Edit.

[FN#156] In Pers. = a tooth, the popular word.

[FN#157] This preliminary move, called in Persian Nakl-i Safar, is generally mentioned. So the Franciscan monks in California, when setting out for a long journey through the desert, marched three times round the convent and pitched tents for the night under its walls.

[FN#158] In Arab. ""Khazinah"" or ""Khaznah"" lit. a treasure, representing 1,000 ""Kís"" or purses (each=£5). The sum in the text is 7,000 purses X 5=£35,000.

[FN#159] Travellers often prefer such sites because they are sheltered from the wind, and the ground is soft for pitching tents; but many have come to grief from sudden torrents following rain.

[FN#160] Arab ""Ghábah"" not a forest in our sense of the word, but a place where water sinks and the trees (mostly Mimosas), which elsewhere are widely scattered, form a comparatively dense growth and collect in thickets. These are favourite places for wild beasts during noon-heats.

[FN#161] At various times in the East Jews and Christians were ordered to wear characteristic garments, especially the Zunnár or girdle.

[FN#162] The description is borrowed from the Coptic Convent, which invariably has an inner donjon or keep. The oldest monastery in the world is Mar Antonios (St. Anthony the Hermit) not far from Suez. (Gold Mines of Midian, p. 85.)

[FN#163] ""Dawáhí,"" plur. of Dáhiyah = a mishap. The title means ""Mistress of Misfortunes"" or Queen of Calamities (to the enemy); and the venerable lady, as will be seen, amply deserved her name, which is pronounced Zát al-Dawáhí.

[FN#164] Arab. ""Kunfuz""=hedgehog or porcupine.

[FN#165] These flowers of speech are mere familiarities, not insults. In societies where the sexes are separated speech becomes exceedingly free. ""Étourdie que vous êtes,"" says M. Riche, toning down the text.

[FN#166] Arab. ""Zirt,"" a low word. The superlative ""Zarrát"" (fartermost) or, ""Abu Zirt"" (Father of farts) is a facetious term among the bean-eating Fellahs and a deadly insult amongst the Badawin (Night ccccx.). The latter prefer the word Taggáa (Pilgrimage iii. 84). We did not disdain the word in farthingale=pet en air.

[FN#167] Arab. ""kicked"" him, i.e. with the sharp corner of the shovel-stirrup. I avoid such expressions as ""spurring"" and ""pricking over the plain,"" because apt to give a wrong idea.

[FN#168] Arab. ""Allaho Akbar!"" the classical Moslem slogan.

[FN#169] Arab horses are never taught to leap, so she was quite safe on the other side of a brook nine feet broad.

[FN#170] ""Batrík"" (vulg. Bitrík)=patricius, a title given to
Christian knights who commanded ten thousand men; the Tarkhan (or
Nobb) heading four thousand, and the Kaumas (Arab. Káid) two
hundred. It must not be confounded with Batrak (or
Batrik)=patriarcha. (Lane's Lex.)

[FN#171] Arab. ""Kázi al-Kuzát,"" a kind of Chief Justice or Chancellor. The office wag established under the rule of Harun al Rashid, who so entitled Abú Yúsuf Ya'akab al-Ansári: therefore the allusion is anachronistic. The same Caliph also caused the Olema to dress as they do still.

[FN#172] The allusion is Koranic: ""O men, if ye be in doubt concerning the resurrection, consider that He first created you of the dust of the ground (Adam), afterwards of seed"" (chaps. xxii.). But the physiological ideas of the Koran are curious. It supposes that the Mani or male semen is in the loins and that of women in the breast bone (chaps Ixxxvi.); that the mingled seed of the two (chaps. Ixxvi.) fructifies the ovary and that the child is fed through the navel with menstruous blood, hence the cessation of the catamenia. Barzoi (Kalilah and Dímnah) says:— ""Man's seed, falling into the woman's womb, is mixed with her seed and her blood: when it thickens and curdles the Spirit moves it and it turns about like liquid cheese; then it solidifies, its arteries are formed, its limbs constructed and its joints distinguished. If the babe is a male, his face is placed towards his mother's back; if a female, towards her belly."" (P. 262, Mr. L G.N. Keith- Falconer's translation.) But there is a curious prolepsis of the spermatozoa-theory. We read (Koran chaps. vii.), ""Thy Lord drew forth their posterity from the loins of the sons of Adam;"" and the commentators say that Allah stroked Adam's back and extracted from his loins all his posterity, which shall ever be, in the shape of small ants; these confessed their dependence on God and were dismissed to return whence they came."" From this fiction it appears (says Sale) that the doctrine of pre-existence is not unknown to the Mohammedans, and there is some little conformity between it and the modern theory of generatio ex animalculis in semine marium. The poets call this Yaum-i-Alast = the Day of Am-I-not (-your Lord)? which Sir William Jones most unhappily translated ""Art thou not with thy Lord ?"" (Alasta bi Rabbi- kum); fand they produce a grand vision of unembodied spirits appearing in countless millions before their Creator.

[FN#173] The usual preliminary of a wrestling bout.

[FN#174] In Eastern wrestling this counts as a fair fail. So Ajax fell on his back with Ulysses on his breast. (Iliad xxxii., 700, etc.)

[FN#175] So biting was allowed amongst the Greeks in the , the final struggle on the ground.

[FN#176] Supposed to be names of noted wrestlers. ""Kayim"" (not El-Kim as Torrens has it) is a term now applied to a juggler or ""professor"" of legerdemain who amuses people in the streets with easy tricks. (Lane, M. E., chaps. xx.)

[FN#177] Lit. ""laughed in his face"" which has not the unpleasant meaning it bears in English.

[FN#178] Arab. ""Abu riyáh""=a kind of child's toy. It is our ""bull-roarer"" well known in Australia and parts of Africa.

[FN#179] The people of the region south of the Caspian which is called ""Sea of Daylam."" It has a long history; for which see D'Herbelot, s.v. ""Dilem.""

[FN#180] Coptic convents in Egypt still affect these drawbridges over the keep-moat.

[FN#181] Koran iv., xxii. etc., meaning it is lawful to marry women taken in war after the necessary purification although their husbands be still living. This is not permitted with a free woman who is a True Believer. I have noted that the only concubine slave-girl mentioned in the Koran are these ""captives possessed by the right hand.""

[FN#182] The Amazonian dame is a favourite in folk-lore and is an ornament to poetry from the Iliad to our modern day. Such heroines, apparently unknown to the Pagan Arabs, were common in the early ages of Al-Islam as Ockley and Gibbon prove, and that the race is not extinct may be seen in my Pilgrimage (iii. 55) where the sister of Ibn Rumi resolved to take blood revenge for her brother.

[FN#183] And Solomon said, ""O nobles, which of you will bring me her throne ?"" A terrible genius (i.e. an If rit of the Jinn named Dhakwan or the notorious Sakhr) said, "" I will bring it unto thee before thou arise from thy seat (of justice); for I am able to perform it, and may be trusted"" (Koran, xxvii. 38-39). Balkís or Bilkís (says the Durrat al-Ghawwás) daughter of Hozád bin Sharhabíl, twenty-second in the list of the rulers of Al- Yaman, according to some murdered her husband, and became, by Moslem ignorance, the Biblical "" Queen of Sheba."" The Abyssinians transfer her from Arabian Saba to Ethiopia and make her the mother by Solomon of Menelek, their proto-monarch; thus claiming for their royalties an antiquity compared with which all reigning houses in the world are of yesterday. The dates of the Tabábi'ah or Tobbas prove that the Bilkis of history ruled Al-Yaman in the early Christian era.

[FN#184] Arab. ""Fass,"" fiss or fuss; the gem set in a ring; also applied to a hillock rounded en cabochon. In The Nights it is used to signify ""a fine gem.""

[FN#185] This prominence of the glutæi muscles is always insisted upon, because it is supposed to promise well in a bed-fellow. In Somali land where the people are sub- steatopygous, a rich young man, who can afford such luxury, will have the girls drawn up in line and choose her to wife who projects furthest behind

[FN#186] The ""bull"" is only half mine.

[FN#187] A favourite Arab phrase, the ""hot eye"" is one full of tears.

[FN#188] i.e., ""Coral,"" coral branch, a favourite name for a slave-girl, especially a negress. It is the older ""Morgiana."" I do not see why Preston in Al-Haríni's ""Makamah (Séance) of Singar"" renders it pearls, because Golius gives ""small pearls,"" when it is evidently ""coral."" Richardson (Dissert. xlviii.) seems to me justified in finding the Pari (fairy) Marjan of heroic Persian history reflected in the Fairy Morgain who earned off King Arthur after the battle of Camelon.

[FN#189] Arab. ""'Ud Jalaki""=Jalak or Jalik being a poetical and almost obsolete name of Damascus.

[FN#190] The fountain in Paradise whose water shall be drunk with ""pure"" wine mixed and sealed with musk (for clay). It is so called because it comes from the ""Sanam"" (Sanima, to be high) boss or highest ridge of the Moslem Heaven (Koran lv. 78 and lxxxiii. 27). Mr. Rodwell says ""it is conveyed to the highest apartments in the Pavilions of Paradise."" (?)

[FN#191] This ""hysterical"" temperament is not rare even amongst the bravest Arabs.

[FN#192] An idea evidently derived from the Æolipyla (olla animatoria) the invention of Hero Alexandrinus, which showed that the ancient Egyptians could apply the motive force of steam.

[FN#193] Kuthayyir ibn Abi Jumah, a poet and far-famed Ráwí or Tale-reciter, mentioned by Ibn Khallikan he lived at Al-Medinah and sang the attractions of one Azzah, hence his soubriquet Sáhib (lover of) Azzah. As he died in A. H. 105 (=726), his presence here is a gross anachronism the imaginary Sharrkan flourished before the Caliphate of Abd al-Malik bin Marwán A. H. 65-86.

[FN#194] Jamíl bin Ma'amar, a poet and lover contemporary with
Al-Kuthayrir.

[FN#195] Arab. ""Tafazzal,"" a word of frequent use in conversation=""favour me,"" etc.

[FN#196] The word has a long history. From the Gr. or is the Lat. stibium; while the Low Latin ""antimonium"" and the Span. Althimod are by metathesis for Al-Ithmid. The dictionaries define the substance as a stone from which antimony is prepared, but the Arabs understand a semi-mythical mineral of yellow colour which enters into the veins of the eyes and gives them Iynx-like vision. The famous Anz nicknamed Zarká (the blue eyed) of Yamámah (Province) used it; and, according to some, invented Kohl. When her (protohistoric) tribe Jadis had destroyed all the rival race of Tasm, except Ribáh ibn Murrah; the sole survivor fled to the Tobba of Al-Yaman, who sent a host to avenge him. The king commanded his Himyarites to cut tree-boughs and use them as screens (again Birnam wood). Zarká from her Utum, or peel-tower, saw the army three marches off and cried, ""O folk, either trees or Himyar are coming upon you!"" adding, in Rajaz verse:—

I swear by Allah that trees creep onward, or that Himyar beareth somewhat which he draweth along!

She then saw a man mending his sandal. But Jadis disbelieved; Cassandra was slain and, when her eyes were cut out the vessels were found full of Ithmid. Hence Al-Mutanabbi sang:

""Sharper-sighted than Zarká of Jau"" (Yamámah).

See C. de Perceval i. 101; Arab. Prov. i. 192; and Chenery p. 381.
(The Assemblies of Al-Hariri; London, Williams and Norgate, 1867).
I have made many enquiries into the true nature of Ithmid and
failed to learn anything: on the Upper Nile the word is=Kohl.

[FN#197] The general colour of chessmen in the East, where the game is played on a cloth more often than a board.

[FN#198] Arab. ""Al-fil,"" the elephant=the French fol or fou and our bishop. I have derived ""elephant"" from Píl (old Persian, Sansk. Pilu) and Arab. Fil, with the article Al-Fil, whence the Greek the suffix—as being devoted to barbarous words as Obod-as (Al Ubayd), Aretas (Al-Háris), etc. Mr. Isaac Taylor (The Alphabet i. 169), preserves the old absurdity of ""eleph-ant or ox-like (!) beast of Africa."" Prof. Sayce finds the word al-ab (two distinct characters) in line 3, above the figure of an (Indian) elephant, on the black obelisk of Nimrod Mound, and suggests an Assyrian derivation.

[FN#199] Arab. ""Shaukat"" which may also mean the ""pride"" or ""mainstay"" (of the army).

[FN#200] Lit. ""smote him on the tendons of his neck."" This is the famous shoulder-cut (Tawash shuh) which, with the leg-cut (Kalam), formed, and still forms, the staple of Eastern attack with the sword.

[FN#201] Arab. ""Dirás."" Easterns do not thresh with flails. The material is strewed over a round and smoothed floor of dried mud in the open air and threshed by different connivances. In Egypt the favourite is a chair-like machine called ""Norag,"" running on iron plates and drawn by bulls or cows over the corn. Generally, however, Moslems prefer the old classical , the Tribulum of Virgil and Varro, a slipper-shaped sled of wood garnished on the sole with large-headed iron nails, or sharp fragments of flint or basalt. Thus is made the ""Tibn"" or straw, the universal hay of the East, which our machines cannot imitate.

[FN#202] These numbers appear to be grossly exaggerated, but they were possible in the days of sword and armour: at the battle of Saffayn the Caliph Ali is said to have cut down five hundred and twenty-three men in a single night.

[FN#203] Arab. ""Bika'á"": hence the ""Buka'ah"" or Clesyria.

[FN#204] Richardson in his excellent dictionary (note 103) which modern priggism finds ""unscientific "" wonderfully derives this word from Arab. ""Khattáf,"" a snatcher (i.e. of women), a ravisher. It is an evident corruption of ""captivus"" through Italian and French

[FN#205] These periodical and fair-like visitations to convents are still customary; especially amongst the Christians of Damascus.

[FN#206] Camphor being then unknown.

[FN#207] The ""wrecker"" is known all over the world; and not only barbarians hold that ships driven ashore become the property of the shore

[FN#208] Arab. ""Jokh"": it is not a dictionary word, but the only term in popular use for European broadcloth.

[FN#209] The second person plural is used because the writer would involve the subjects of his correspondent in the matter.

[FN#210] This part of the phrase, which may seem unnecessary to the European, is perfectly intelligible to all Orientalists. You may read many an Eastern letter and not understand it. Compare Boccacoo iv. 1.

[FN#211] i.e. he was greatly agitated

[FN#212] In text ""Li-ajal a al-Taudi'a,"" for the purpose of farewelling, a low Egyptianism; emphatically a ""Kalám wáti."" (Pilgrimage thee iii. 330.)

[FN#213] In the Mac. Edit. Sharrkan speaks, a clerical error.

[FN#214] The Farsakh (Germ. Stunde) a measure of time rather than distance, is an hour's travel or its equivalent, a league, a meile=three English stat. miles. The word is still used in Persia its true home, but not elsewhere. It is very old, having been determined as a lineal measure of distance by Herodotus (ii. 5 and 6 ; v. 53), who computes it at 30 furlongs (=furrow-lengths, 8 to the stat. mile). Strabo (xi.) makes it range from 40 to 60 stades (each=606 feet 9 inches), and even now it varies between 1,500 to 6,000 yards. Captain Francklin (Tour to Persia) estimates it = about four miles. (Pilgrimage ii. 113.)

[FN#215] Arab. ""Ashhab."" Names of colours are few amongst semi civilised peoples, but in Arabia there is a distinct word for every shade of horseflesh.

[FN#216] She had already said to him ""Thou art beaten in everything!""

[FN#217] Showing that she was still a Christian.

[FN#218] This is not Badawi sentiment: the honoratioren amongst wild people would scorn such foul play; but amongst the settled Arabs honour between men and women is unknown and such ""hocussing"" would be held quite fair.

[FN#219] The table of wine, in our day, is mostly a japanned tray with glasses and bottles, saucers of pickles and fruits and, perhaps, a bunch of flowers and aromatic herbs. During the Caliphate the ""wine-service"" was on a larger scale.

[FN#220] Here the ""Bhang"" (almost a generic term applied to hellebore, etc.) may be hyoscyamus or henbane. Yet there are varieties of Cannabis, such as the Dakha of South Africa capable of most violent effect. I found the use of the drug well known to the negroes of the Southern United States and of the Brazil, although few of their owners had ever heard of it.

[FN#221] Amongst Moslems this is a reference to Adam who first ""sinned against himself,' and who therefore is called "" Safíyu'llah,"" the Pure of Allah. (Pilgrimage iii. 333.)

[FN#222] Meaning, an angry, violent man.

[FN#223] Arab. ""Inshád,"" which may mean reciting the verse of another or improvising one's own. In Modern Egypt ""Munshid"" is the singer or reciter of poetry at Zikrs (Lane M. E. chaps. xxiv.). Here the verses are quite bad enough to be improvised by the hapless Princess.

[FN#224] The negro skin assumes this dust colour in cold, fear, concupiscence and other mental emotions.

[FN#225] He compares her glance with the blade of a Yamani sword, a lieu commun of Eastern poetry. The weapons are famous in The Nights; but the best sword-cutlery came from Persia as the porcelain from China to Sana'á. Here, however, is especial allusion as to the sword ""Samsam"" or ""Samsamah."" It belonged to the Himyarite Tobba, Amru bin Ma'ad Kurb, and came into the hands of Harun al-Rashid. When the Emperor of the Greeks sent a present of superior sword-blades to him by way of a brave, the Caliph, in the presence of the Envoys, took ""Samsam"" in hand and cut the others in twain as if they were cabbages without the least prejudice to the edge of ""Samsam.""

[FN#226] This touch of pathos is truly Arab. So in the ""Romance of Dalhamah"" (Lane, M. E. xxiii.) the infant Gundubah sucks the breast of its dead mother and the King exclaims, ""If she had committed this crime she would not be affording the child her milk after she was dead.""

[FN#227] Arab. ""Sadda'l-Aktár,"" a term picturesque enough to be preserved in English. ""Sadd,"" I have said, is a wall or dyke, the term applied to the great dam of water- plants which obstructs the navigation of the Upper Nile, the lilies and other growths floating with the current from the (Victoria) Nyanza Lake. I may note that we need no longer derive from India the lotus-llily so extensively used by the Ancient Egyptians and so neglected by the moderns that it has well nigh disappeared. All the Central African basins abound in the Nymphæa and thence it found its way down the Nile Valley.

[FN#228] Arab. ""Al Marhúmah"": equivalent to our ""late lamented.""

[FN#229] Vulgarly pronounced ""Mahmal,"" and by Egyptians and Turks ""Mehmel."" Lane (M. E. xxiv.) has figured this queenly litter and I have sketched and described it in my Pilgrimage (iii. 12).

[FN#230] For such fits of religious enthusiasm see my Pilgrimage (iii. 254).

[FN#231] ""Irák"" (Mesopotamia) means ""a level country beside the banks of a ever.""

[FN#232] ""Al Kuds,"" or ""Bays al-Mukaddas,"" is still the popular name of Jerusalem, from the Heb. Yerushalaim ha-Kadushah (legend on shekel of Simon Maccabeus).

[FN#233] ""Follow the religion of Abraham"" says the Koran (chaps. iii. 89). Abraham, titled ""Khalílu'llah,"" ranks next in dignity to Mohammed, preceding Isa, I need hardly say that his tomb is not in Jerusalem nor is the tomb itself at Hebron ever visited. Here Moslems (soi disant) are allowed by the jealousies of Europe to close and conceal a place which belongs to the world, especially to Jews and Christians. The tombs, if they exist, lie in a vault or cave under the Mosque.

[FN#234] Abá, or Abáyah, vulg. Abayah, is a cloak of hair, goat's or camel's; too well known to require description.

[FN#235] Arab. ""Al-Wakkád,"" the man who lights and keeps up the bath-fires.

[FN#236] Arab. ""Má al-Khaláf"" (or ""Khiláf"") a sickly perfume but much prized, made from the flowers of the Salix Ægyptiaca.

[FN#237] Used by way of soap; like glasswort and other plants.

[FN#238] i.e., ""Thou art only just recovered.""

[FN#239] To ""Nakh"" is to gurgle ""Ikh! Ikh!"" till the camel kneels. Hence the space called ""Barr al-Manákhah"" in Al-Medinah (Pilgrimage i. 222, ii. 91). There is a regular camel vocabulary amongst the Arabs, made up like our ""Gee"" (go ye!), etc. of significant words worn down.

[FN#240] Arab. ""Laza,"" the Second Hell provided for Jews.

[FN#241] The word has been explained (vol. i. 112).[see Volume 1, note 199] It is trivial, not occurring in the Koran which uses ""Arabs of the Desert ;"" ""Arabs who dwell in tents,"" etc. (chaps. ix. and xxxiii.). ""A'arábi"" is the classical word and the origin of ""Arab"" is disputed. According to Pocock (Notæ Spec. Hist. Arab.): ""Diverse are the opinions concerning the denomination of the Arabs; but the most certain of all is that which draws it from Arabah, which is part of the region of Tehama (belonging to Al-Medinah Pilgrimage ii. 118), which their father Ismail afterwards inhabited."" Tehamah (sierra caliente) is the maritime region of Al Hijaz, the Moslems Holy Land; and its ""Arabah,"" a very small tract which named a very large tract, must not be confounded, as some have done, with the Wady Arabah, the ancient outlet of the Dead Sea. The derivation of ""Arab"" from ""Ya'arab"" a fancied son of Joktan is mythological. In Heb. Arabia may be called ""Eretz Ereb"" (or ""Arab"")=land of the West; but in Arabic ""Gharb"" (not Ereb) is the Occident and the Arab dates long before the Hebrew.

[FN#242] ""When thine enemy extends his hand to thee, cut it off if thou can, or kiss it,"" wisely said Caliph al-Mansur.

[FN#243] The Tartur was a peculiar turban worn by the Northern Arabs and shown in old prints. In modern Egypt the term is applied to the tall sugar-loaf caps of felt affected mostly by regular Dervishes. Burckhardt (Proverbs 194 and 398) makes it the high cap of felt or fur proper to the irregular cavalry called Dely or Delaty. In Dar For (Darfour) ""Tartur"" is a conical cap adorned with beads and cowries worn by the Manghwah or buffoon who corresponds with the Egyptian ""Khalbús"" or ""Maskharah"" and the Turkish ""Sutari."" For an illustration see Plate iv. fig. 10 of Voyage au Darfour par Mohammed El Tounsy (The Tunisian), Paris, Duprat, 1845.

[FN#244] The term is picturesque and true; we say ""gnaw,"" which is not so good.

[FN#245] Here, meaning an Elder, a Chief, etc.; the word has been almost naturalised in English. I have noted that Abraham was the first ""Shaykh.""

[FN#246] This mention of weighing suggests the dust of Dean Swift and the money of the Gold Coast It was done, I have said, because the gold coin, besides being ""sweated"" was soft and was soon worn down.

[FN#247] Fem. of Nájí (a deliverer, a saviour)=Salvadora.

[FN#248] This, I have noted, is according to Koranic command (chaps. iv. 88). ""When you are saluted with a salutation, salute the person with a better salutation."" The longer answer to ""Peace be with (or upon) thee! "" is still universally the custom. The ""Salem"" is so differently pronounced by every Eastern nation that the observant traveller will easily make of it a Shibboleth.

[FN#249] The Badawi, who was fool as well as rogue, begins to fear that he has kidnapped a girl of family.

[FN#250] These examinations being very indecent are usually done in strictest privacy. The great point is to make sure of virginity.

[FN#251] This is according to strict Moslem law: the purchaser may not look at the girl's nakedness till she is his, and he ought to manage matters through an old woman.

[FN#252] Lit. wrath; affliction which chokes; in Hindustani it means simply anger.

[FN#253] i.e. Heaven forbid I be touched by a strange man.

[FN#254] Used for fuel and other purposes, such as making ""doss stick.""

[FN#255] Arab ""Yaftah'Allah"" the offer being insufficient. The rascal is greedy as a Badaw and moreover he is a liar, which the Badawi is not.

[FN#256] The third of the four great Moslem schools of Theology, taking its name from the Imam al-Sháfi'í (Mohammed ibn Idrís) who died in Egypt A.H. 204, and lies buried near Cairo. (Sale's Prel. Disc. sect. viii.)

[FN#257] The Moslem form of Cabbala, or transcendental philosophy of the Hebrews.

[FN#258] Arab. ""Bakh"" the word used by the Apostle to Ali his son-in-law. It is the Latin ""Euge.""

[FN#259] Readers, who read for amusement, will do well to ""skip"" the fadaises of this highly educated young woman.

[FN#260] There are three Persian Kings of this name (Artaxerxes)
which means ""Flour and milk,"" or ""high lion."" The text alludes to
Ardeshir Babegan, so called because he married the daughter of
Babak the shepherd, founder of the Sassanides in A.D. 202. See
D,Herberot, and the Dabistan.

[FN#261] Alluding to the proverb, ""Folk follow their King's faith,""
""Cujus regio ejus religio"" etc.

[FN#262] Second Abbaside, A.H. 136-158 (=754-775).

[FN#263] The celebrated companion of Mohammed who succeeded Abu Bakr in the Caliphate (A.H. 13-23=634-644). The Sunnis know him as Al-Adil the Just, and the Shiahs detest him for his usurpation, his austerity and harshness. It is said that he laughed once and wept once. The laugh was caused by recollecting how he ate his dough-gods (the idols of the Hanifah tribe) in The Ignorance. The tears were drawn by remembering how he buried alive his baby daughter who, while the grave was being dug, patted away the dust from his hair and beard. Omar was doubtless a great man, but he is one of the most ungenial figures in Moslem history which does not abound in genialities. To me he suggests a Puritan, a Covenanter of the sourest and narrowest type; and I cannot wonder that the Persians abhor him, and abuse him on all occasions.

[FN#264] The austere Caliph Omar whose scourge was more feared than the sword was the - author of the celebrated saying ""Consult them (feminines) and do clear contrary-wise.""

[FN#265] Our ""honour amongst thieves.""

[FN#266] The sixth successor of Mohammed and founder of the Banu Umayyah or Ommiades, called the ""sons of the little mother"" from their eponymus (A.H. 41-60=661-680). For his Badawi wife Maysun, and her abuse of her husband, see Pilgrimage iii. 262.

[FN#267] Shaykh of the noble tribe, or rather nation, Banu Tamím and a notable of the day, surnamed, no one knows why, ""Sire of the Sea.""

[FN#268] This is essential for cleanliness in hot lands: however much the bath may be used, the body-pile and lower hair, if submitted to a microscope, will show more or less sordes adherent. The axilla-hair is plucked because if shaved the growing pile causes itching and the depilatories are held deleterious. At first vellication is painful but the skin becomes used to it. The pecten is shaved either without or after using depilatories, of which more presently. The body-pile is removed by ""Takhfíf""; the Libán Shámi (Syrian incense), a fir- gum imported from Scio, is melted and allowed to cool in the form of a pledget. This is passed over the face and all the down adhering to it is pulled up by the roots (Burckhardt No. 420). Not a few Anglo-Indians have adopted these precautions

[FN#269] This Caliph was a tall, fair, handsome man of awe-inspiring aspect. Omar used to look at him and say, ""This is the Cæsar of the Arabs,"" while his wife called him a ""fatted ass.""

[FN#270] The saying is attributed to Abraham when ""exercised"" by the unkindly temper of Sarah; ""woman is made hard and crooked like a rib;"" and the modern addition is, ""whoso would straighten her, breaketh her.""

[FN#271] i.e. ""When ready and in erection.""

[FN#272] ""And do first (before going in to your wives) some act which may be profitable unto your souls"" or, for you: soul's good. (Koran, chaps. ii. 223.) Hence Ahnaf makes this prayer.

[FN#273] It was popularly said that ""Truth-speaking left Omar without a friend."" Entitled ""The Just"" he was murdered by Abu Lúlúah, alias Fírúz, a (Magian ?) slave of Al-Maghírah for denying him justice.

[FN#274] Governor of Bassorah under the first four Caliphs. See
D'Herbelot s.v. ""Aschári.""

[FN#275] Ziyad bin Abi Sufyan, illegitimate brother of the Caliph
Mu'awiyah afterwards governor of Bassorah, Cufa and Al-Hijaz.

[FN#276] The seditions in Kufah were mainly caused by the wilful nepotism of Caliph Othman bin Asákir which at last brought about his death. His main quality seems to have been personal beauty: ""never was seen man or woman of fairer face than he and he was the most comely of men:"" he was especially famed for beautiful teeth which in old age he bound about with gold wire. He is described as of middling stature, large- limbed, broad shouldered, fleshy of thigh and long in the fore-arm which was hairy. His face inclined to yellow and was pock-marked; his beard was full and his curly hair, which he dyed yellow, fell below his ears. He is called ""writer of the Koran"" from his edition of the M.S., and ""Lord of the two Lights"" because he married two of the Prophet's daughters, Rukayyah and Umm Kulthum; and, according to the Shi'ahs who call him Othman-i-Lang or"" limping Othman,"" he vilely maltreated them. They justify his death as the act of an Ijmá' al-Muslimín, the general consensus of Moslems which ratifies ""Lynch law."" Altogether Othman is a mean figure in history.

[FN#277] ""Nár"" (fire) is a word to be used delicately from its connection with Gehenna. You say, e.g. ""bring me a light, a coal (bassah)"" etc.; but if you say ""bring me fire! "" the enemy will probably remark ""He wanteth fire even before his time!"" The slang expression would be ""bring the sweet."" (Pilgrimage i. 121.)

[FN#278] Omar is described as a man of fair complexion, and very ruddy, but he waxed tawny with age, when he also became bald and grey. He had little hair on the cheeks but a long mustachio with reddish ends. In stature he overtopped the people and was stout as he was tall. A popular saying of Mohammed's is, ""All (very) long men are fools save Omar, and all (very) short men are knaves save Ali."" The Persians, who abhor Omar, compare every lengthy, ungainly, longsome thing with him; they will say, ""This road never ends, like the entrails of Omar."" We know little about Ali's appearance except that he was very short and stout, broad and full-bellied with a tawny complexion and exceedingly hairy, his long beard, white as cotton, filling all the space between his shoulders. He was a ""pocket. Hercules,"" and incredible tales, like that about the gates of Khaybar, are told of his strength. Lastly, he was the only Caliph who bequeathed anything to literature: his ""Cantiloquium"" is famous and he has left more than one mystical and prophetic work. See Ockley for his ""Sentences"" and D'Herbelot s. D. ""Ali"" and ""Gebr."" Ali is a noble figure in Moslem history.

[FN#279] The emancipation from the consequences of his sins; or it may mean a holy death.

[FN#280] Battle fought near Al-Medinah A.D. 625. The word is derived from ""shad"" (one). I have described the site in my Pilgrimage, (vol. ii. 227).

[FN#281] ""Haphsa"" in older writers; Omar's daughter and one of Mohammed's wives, famous for her connection with the manuscripts of the Koran. From her were (or claimed to be) descended the Hafsites who reigned in Tunis and extended their power far and wide over the Maghrib (Mauritania), till dispossessed by the Turks.

[FN#282] i.e. humbly without the usual strut or swim: it corresponds with the biblical walking or going softly. (I Kings xxi. 27; Isaiah xxxviii. 15, etc.)

[FN#283] A theologian of the seventh and eighth centuries.

[FN#284] i.e. to prepare himself by good works, especially alms-giving, for the next world.

[FN#285] A theologian of the eighth century.

[FN#286] Abd al-Aziz was eighth Ommiade (regn. A.H. 99=717) and the fifth of the orthodox, famed for a piety little known to his house. His most celebrated saying was, "" Be constant in meditation on death: if thou bein straitened case 'twill enlarge it, and if in affluence 'twill straiten it upon thee."" He died. poisoned, it is said, in A.H 101,

[FN#287] Abu Bakr originally called Abd al-Ka'abah (slave of the Ka'abah) took the name of Abdullah and was surnamed Abu Bakr (father of the virgin) when Mohammed, who before had married only widows, took to wife his daughter, the famous or infamous Ayishah. ""Bikr"" is the usual form, but ""Bakr,"" primarily meaning a young camel, is metaphorically applied to human youth (Lane's Lex. s. c.). The first Caliph was a cloth-merchant, like many of the Meccan chiefs. He is described as very fair with bulging brow, deep set eyes and thin-checked, of slender build and lean loined, stooping and with the backs of his hands fleshless. He used tinctures of Henna and Katam for his beard. The Persians who hate him, call him ""Pir-i-Kaftár,"" the old she-hyaena, and believe that he wanders about the deserts of Arabia in perpetual rut which the males must satisfy.

[FN#288] The second, fifth, sixth and seventh Ommiades.

[FN#289] The mother of Omar bin Abd al-Aziz was a granddaughter of
Omar bin al-Khattab.

[FN#290] Brother of this Omar's successor, Yezid II.

[FN#291] So the Turkish proverb ""The fish begins to stink at the head.""

[FN#292] Calling to the slaves.

[FN#293] When the ""Day of Arafat"" (9th of Zú'l-Hijjah) falls upon a Friday. For this Hajj al- Akbar see my Pilgrimage iii. 226. It is often confounded by writers (even by the learned M. Caussin de Perceval) with the common Pilgrimage as opposed to the Umrah, or "" Lesser Pilgrimage"" (ibid. iii. 342, etc.). The latter means etymologically cohabiting with a woman in her father's house as opposed to 'Ars or leading her to the husband's home: it is applied to visiting Meccah and going through all the pilgrim-rites but not at the Pilgrimage-season. Hence its title ""Hajj al-Asghar"" the ""Lesser Hajj."" But ""Umrah"" is also applied to a certain ceremony between the hills Safá (a large hard rock) and Marwah (stone full of flints), which accompanies the Hajj and which I have described (ibid. iii. 344). At Meccah I also heard of two places called Al-Umrah, the Greater in the Wady Fátimah and the Lesser half way nearer the city (ibid. iii. 344).

[FN#294] A fair specimen of the unworthy egoism which all religious systems virtually inculcate Here a pious father leaves his children miserable to save his own dirty soul.

[FN#295] Chief of the Banú Tamín, one of the noblest of tribes, derived from Tamím, the uncle of Kuraysh (Koreish); hence the poets sang:—

             There cannot be a son nobler than Kuraysh,
             Nor an uncle nobler than Tamím.

The high minded Tamín is contrasted with the mean-spirited Kays, who also gave rise to a tribe; and hence the saying concerning one absolutely inconsistent, ""Art thou now Tamín and then Kays?""

[FN#296] Surnamed Al-Sakafi, Governor of Al-Yaman and Irak.

[FN#297] Tenth Ommiade (regn. A H. 105-125 = 724-743).

[FN#298] Or ""clothe thee in worn-out clothes"" i.e. ""Become a Fakir"" or religious mendicant.

[FN#299] This gratuitous incest in ignorance injures the tale and is as repugnant to Moslem as to Christian taste.

[FN#300] The child is named either on the day of its birth or on that day week. The father whispers it in the right ear, often adding the Azán or prayer-call, and repeating in the left ear the ""Ikámah"" or Friday sentence. There are many rules for choosing names according to the week-day, the ascendant planet, the ""Sortes Coranicæ,"" etc.

[FN#301] Amongst Moslems as amongst Christians there are seven deadly sins: idolatry, murder, falsely charging modest women with unchastity, robbing orphans, usury, desertion in Holy War and disobedience to parents. The difference between the two creeds is noteworthy. And the sage knows only three, intemperance, ignorance and egoism.

[FN#302] Meaning, ""It was decreed by Destiny; so it came to pass,"" appropriate if not neat.

[FN#303] The short, stout, dark, long-haired and two-bunched camel from ""Bukhtar"" (Bactria), the ""Eastern"" (Bakhtar) region on the Amu or Jayhun (Oxus) River; afterwards called Khorasan. The two-humped camel is never seen in Arabia except with northern caravans, and to speak of it would be a sore test of Badawi credulity.

[FN#304] ""Kaylúlah"" is the ""forty-winks"" about noon: it is a Sunnat or Practice of the Prophet who said, ""Make the mid-day siesta, for verily at this hour the devils sleep not."" ""Aylúlain"" is slumbering after morning prayers (our ""beauty-sleep""), causing heaviness andid leness: ""Ghaylúlah"" is dozing about 9 a.m. engendering poverty and wretchedness: ""Kaylúlah"" (with the guttural Kaf) is sleeping before evening prayers and ""Faylúlah"" is slumbering after sunset—both held to be highly detrimental. (Pilgrimage ii 49.)

[FN#305] The Biblical ""Hamath"" (Hightown) too well known to require description. It is still famous for the water-wheels mentioned by al-Hariri (assembly of the Banu Harám).

[FN#306] When they say, ""The levee flashes bright on the hills of
Al-Yaman,"" the allusion is to the south quarter, where
summer-lightning is seen. Al-Yaman (always with the article) means,
I have said, the right-hand region to one facing the rising sun and
Al-Sham (Syria) the left-hand region.
[FN#307] Again ""he"" for ""she,"" in delicacy and jealousy of making public the beauty or conditions of the ""veiled sex."" Even public singers would hesitate to use a feminine pronoun. As will be seen however, the rule is not invariably kept and hardly ever in Badawi poetry.

[FN#308] The normal pun on ""Nuzhat al-Zaman"" = Delight of the Age or Time.

[FN#309] The reader will find in my Pilgrimage (i. 305) a sketch of the Takht-rawan or travelling-litter, in which pilgrimesses are wont to sleep.

[FN#310] In poetry it holds the place of our Zephyr; end the ""Bád- i-Sabá""=Breeze o' the morn, Is much addressed by Persian poets.

[FN#311] Here appears the nervous, excitable, hysterical Arab temperament which is almost phrensied by the neighbourhood of a home from which he had run away.

[FN#312] Zau al-Makan and Nuzhat al-Zaman.

[FN#313] The idea is essentially Eastern, ""A lion at home and a lamb abroad"" is the popular saying.

[FN#314] Arab. ""Hubb al-Watan"" (= love of birthplace, patriotism) of which the Tradition says ""Min al-Imán"" (=is part of man's religion).

[FN#315] He is supposed to speak en prince; and he yields to a prayer when he spurns a command.

[FN#316] In such caravans each party must keep its own place under pain of getting into trouble with the watchmen and guards.

[FN#317] Mr. Payne (ii. 109) borrows this and the next quotation from the Bull Edit. i. 386.

[FN#318] For the expiation of inconsiderate oaths see Koran (chaps. v.). I cannot but think that Al-Islam treats perjury too lightly: all we can say is-that it improves upon Hinduism which practically seems to leave the punishment to the gods.

[FN#319] ""Kausar,"" as has been said, represents the classical nectar, the Amrita of the Hindus.

[FN#320] From Bull Edit. i. 186. The couplet in the Mac. Edit. i. 457 is very wildly applied.

[FN#321] The ""insula"" of Sancho Panza.

[FN#322] This should have assured him that he stood in no danger.

[FN#323] Here ends the wearisome tale of the brother and sister, and the romance of chivalry begins once more with the usual Arab digressions.

[FN#324] I have derived this word from the Persian ""rang""=colour, hue, kind.

[FN#325] Otherwise all would be superseded, like U. S. officials under a new President.

[FN#326] Arab. ""Nímshah"" from the Pers. Nímchah, a ""half-sword,"" a long dagger worn in the belt. Richardson derives it from Namsh, being freckled (damasked).

[FN#327] The Indian term for a tent large enough to cover a troop of cavalry.

[FN#328] Arab. ""Marhúm"" a formula before noticed. It is borrowed from the Jewish, ""of blessed memory"" (after the name of the honoured dead, Prov. x. 17.); with the addition of ""upon whom be peace,"" as opposed to the imprecation, ""May the name of the wicked rot!""

[FN#329] The speeches of the five damsels should be read only by students.

[FN#330] i.e. Those who look for ""another and a better.""

[FN#331] The title of Caliph Abu Bakr because he bore truthful witness to the Apostle's mission or, others say, he confirmed the ""Mi'ráj"" or nocturnal journey to Heaven.

[FN#332] All this is Koranic (chaps. ii., etc.).

[FN#333] This may have applied more than once to ""hanging judges"" in the Far West.

[FN#334] A traditionist and jurisconsult of Al-Medinah in the seventh and eighth centuries.

[FN#335] The Alexander of the Koran and Eastern legends, not to be confounded with the Alexander of Macedon. He will be noticed in a future Night.

[FN#336] Æsop, according to the Arabs: of him or rather of the two
Lukmans, more presently.

[FN#337] Koran ii. 185.

[FN#338] Mohammed.

[FN#339] One of the Asháb or Companions of Mohammed.

[FN#340] A noted traditionist at Cufa in the seventh century.

[FN#341] Koran, chaps. lxxiv. I (and verse 8 follows). The Archangel Gabriel is supposed to address Mohammed and not a few divines believe this Surah (chapter) to have been first revealed. Mr. Rodwell makes it No. ii. following the Fatrah or silent interval which succeeded No. xcvi. ""Clots of Blood."" See his 2nd Edit. p. 3 for further details.

[FN#342] i.e. dangerous to soul-health.

[FN#343] In the Mac. Edit. ""Abd"" for ""Sa'id."" The latter was a black and a native of Cufa during the first century (A.H ) and is still famous as a traditionist.

[FN#344] Arab. ""Shirk,"" giving a partner to Allah, attending chiefly to Christians and idolaters and in a minor degree to Jews and Guebres. We usually English it by ""polytheism,"" which is clumsy and conveys a wrong idea

[FN#345] Grandson of the Caliph Ali. He is one of the Imams
(High-priests) of the Shi'ah school.

[FN#346] An eminent traditionist of the eighth century (A.D.).

[FN#347] The prayers of the Fast-month and Pilgrimage-month are often said in especial places outside the towns and cities; these are the Indian Id(Eed-)gáh. They have a screen of wall about a hundred yards long with a central prayer-niche and the normal three steps for the preacher; and each extremity is garnished with an imitation minaret. They are also called Namáz-gah and one is sketched by Herklots (Plate iii. fig. 2). The object of the trips thither in Zu'l-Ka'adah and Zu'l-Hijjah is to remind Moslems of the ""Ta'aríf,"" or going forth from Meccah to Mount Arafat.

[FN#348] Arab. ""Al-Háfi,"" which in Egyptian means sore-footed as well. He was an ascetic of the eighth and ninth centuries (A.D.). He relates a tradition of the famous soldier saint Khálid bin Walíd who lies buried like the poet Ka'ab al-Ahbár near Hums (Emessa) once the Botia, Phrygia, Abdera, Suabia of Syria now Halbun (pronounced Halbáun) near Damascus. I cannot explain how this Kuraysh noble (a glorious figure in Moslem history) is claimed by the Afghans as one of their countrymen and made to speak Pukhtu or Pushtu, their rough old dialect of Persian. The curious reader will consult my Pilgrimage iii. 322 for the dialogue between Mohammed and Khalid. Again there is general belief in Arabia that the English sent a mission to the Prophet, praying that Khalid might be despatched to proselytise them: unfortunately Mohammed was dead and the ""Ingríz"" ratted. It is popularly held that no armed man can approach Khalid's grave; but I suppose my revolver did not count.

[FN#349] When he must again wash before continuing prayer.

[FN#350] Bin Adham; another noted ascetic of the eighth century.
Those curious about these unimportant names will consult the great
Biographical Dictionary of Ibn Khallikan, translated by Baron
MacGuckin de Slane (1842-45).

[FN#351] Thus making Bishr the ""Imám"" (artistes) lit. one who stands in front. In Koran xvii. 74 it means ""leader"": in ii. 118 Allah makes Abraham an ""Imam to mankind.""

[FN#352] A favourite sentiment in the East: we find it at the very beginning of Sa'di's Gulistan: better a weal-bringing lie than a harm-dealing truth.

[FN#353] A penny, one sixth of the drachma.

[FN#354] Founder of the Hanbali, fourth (in date) of the four orthodox Moslem schools. The Caliph al-Mu'atasim bi'llah, son of Harun al-Rashid, who believed the Koran to have been created and not a Logos (whatever that may be), co-eternal with Allah, scourged this Imam severely for ""differing in opinion"" (A.H. 220=833). In fact few of the notable reverends of that day escaped without a caress of the scourge or the sword.

[FN#355] A learned man of the eighth century at Bassorah (A.D.).

[FN#356] A traditionist of Khorasan in the ninth century (A.D.).

[FN#357] ""Azal,"" opp. to ""Abad,"" eternity without end, infinity.

[FN#358] Koran lxvi. 6.

[FN#359] A traditionist of Al-Medinah, eighth century (A.D.).

[FN#360] Arab. ""Músá"": the Egyptian word was ""Mesu,"" the ""child"" or the ""boy"" (brought up in the palace?), and the Hebrews made it ""Mosheh"" or ""one drawn out of the water;"" ""Mu"" in Egypt being water, the Arab ""Ma""; whence probably the moderns have derived the dim. ""Moyeh ,"" vulg. Egyptian for water.

[FN#361] Koran, chaps. xxviii.: Shu'ayb is our Jethro: Koran, chaps. vii. and xi. Mr. Rodwell suggests (p. 101) that the name has been altered from Hobab (Numb. x. 29).

[FN#362] Arab. ""Taub"" (Saub), the long shirt popularly written in English Tobe and pronounced so by Egyptians. It is worn by both sexes (Lane, M. E. chaps. i. ""Tob"") in Egypt, and extends into the heart of Moslem Africa: I can compare it with nothing but a long nightgown dyed a dirty yellow by safflower and about as picturesque as a carter's smock-frock.

[FN#363] There is nothing of this in the Koran; and it is a most unhappy addition, as Moses utterly and pretentiously ignored a ""next world.""

[FN#364] Koran xxviii. 22-27. Mohammed evidently confounded the contract between Laban and Jacob. (Gen. xxix. 15-39.)

[FN#365] So says Al-Hariri (Ass. of Sasan), ""The neighbour before the house and the traveller before the journey."" In certain cities the neighbourhood is the real detective police, noting every action and abating scandals (such as orgies, etc.) with a strong hand and with the full consent of public opinion and of the authorities. This loving the neighbour shows evident signs of being borrowed from Christianity.

[FN#366] Al-Asamm a theologian of Balkh, ninth century (A.D.).

[FN#367] The founder of the Senior School, for which see Sale Prel.
Disc. sect. viii.

[FN#368] Thus serving the Lord by sinning against his own body.

[FN#369] An Egyptian doctor of the law (ninth century).

[FN#370] Koran lxxvii. 35, 36. This is one of the earliest and most poetical chapters of the book.

[FN#371] Abu Hanifah was scourged for refusing to take office and was put to death in prison, it is said by poison (A.H. 150=A.D. 767), for a judicial sentence authorising rebellion against the second Abbaside, Al-Mansur, surnamed Abu'l-Dawánik (Father of Pence) for his exceeding avarice.

[FN#372] ""Lá rayba fí-hi"" says the Koran (ii. 1) of itself; and the saying is popularly applied to all things of the Faith.

[FN#373] Arab. ""Rivál al-Ghayb,"" somewhat like the ""Himalayan Brothers"" of modern superstition. See Herklots (Qanoon-e-Islam) for a long and careful description of these ""Mardán-i-Ghayb"" (Pers.), a ""class of people mounted on clouds,"" invisible, but moving in a circular orbit round the world, and suggesting the Hindu ""Lokapálas."" They should not be in front of the traveller nor on his right, but either behind or on his left hand. Hence tables, memorial couplets and hemistichs are required to ascertain the station, without which precaution journeys are apt to end badly.

[FN#374] A sweetmeat before noticed.

[FN#375] Door hinges in the east are two projections for the top and bottom of the leaf playing in hollows of the lintel and threshold. It appears to be the primitive form, for we find it in the very heart of Africa. In the basaltic cities of the Hauran, where the doors are of thick stone, they move easily on these pins. I found them also in the official (not the temple)City of Palmyra, but all broken.

[FN#376] The effect of the poison and of the incantation which accompanied it.

[FN#377] King Omar who had raped her. My sympathies are all with the old woman who nightly punished the royal lecher.

[FN#378] Arab. ""Zunnár,"" the Gr. . Christians and Jews were compelled by the fanatical sumptuary laws of the Caliph Al- Mutawakkil (AD. 856) to wear a broad leather belt in public, hence it became a badge of the Faith. Probably it was confounded with the ""Janeo"" (Brahmanical thread) and the Parsi sacred girdle called Kashti. (Dabistan i, 297, etc.). Both Mandeville and La Brocquière speak of ""Christians of the Girdle, because they are all girt above,"" intending Jacobites or Nestorians.

[FN#379] ""Siláh dár"" (Arab. and Pers.)=a military officer of high rank; literally an ""armour-bearer,"" chosen for velour and trustworthiness. So Jonathan had a ""young man"" (brave) who bare his armour (I Sam. xiv. 1, 6 and 7); and Goliath had a man that bare the shield before him (ibid. xvii. 7, 41). Men will not readily forget the name of Sulayman Agha, called the Silahdar, in Egypt. (Lane M. E. chaps. iv.)

[FN#380] It will be told afterwards.

[FN#381] The elder brother thus showed himself a vassal and proved himself a good Moslem by not having recourse to civil war.

[FN#382] Arab. ""Ghazwah,"" the corrupt Gallicism, now
Europeanised=raid, foray.
[FN#383] Turk in modern parlance means a Turkoman, a pomade: the settled people call themselves Osmanli or Othmanli. Turkoman=Turk- like.

[FN#384] Arab. ""Nimsá;"" southern Germans, Austrians; from the Slav. ""Nemica"" (any Germans), literally meaning ""The dumb"" (nemac), because they cannot speak Slav.

[FN#385] Arab. ""Dubárá"" from the Slav. ""Dubrovnik,"" from ""Dub"" (an oak) and ""Dubrava"" (an oak forest). Ragusa, once a rival of Venice, gave rise to the word ""Argosy."" D'Herbelot calls it ""Dobravenedik"" or ""Good Venice,"" the Turkish name, because it paid tribute when Venice would not (?).

[FN#386] Arab. ""Jawarnah,"" or, ""Júrnah"" evidently Zara, a place of many names, Jadera (Hirtius de Bell. Alex. cap. 13), Jadra, Zadra (whence the modern term), Diadora, Diadosca and Jadrossa. This important Liburnian city sent forth many cruisers in crusading days; hence the Arabs came to know its name.

[FN#387] Arab. ""Banu'l-Asfar;"" which may mean ""Pale faces,"" in the sense of ""yeller girls"" (New Orleans) and that intended by North American Indians, or, possibly, the peoples with yellow (or rather tow-coloured) hair we now call Russians. The races of Hindostan term the English not ""white men,"" but ""red men;"" and the reason will at once be seen by comparing a Britisher with a high-caste Nágar Brahman whose face is of parchment colour as if he had drunk exsangue cuminum. The Yellow-faces of the text correspond with the Sansk. ""Svetadvipa""—Whiteman's Land.

[FN#388] Arab. ""Al-Musakhkham."" No Moslem believes that Isa was crucified and a favourite fancy is that Judas, changed to the likeness of Jesus, thus paid for his treason. (Evangel. Barnabæ.) Hence the resurrection is called not ""Kiyámah"" but ""Kumámah""=rubbish. This heresy about the Cross they share with the Docetes, ""certain beasts in the shape of men"" (says Ignatius), who held that a phantom was crucified. So far the Moslems are logical, for ""Isa,"" being angelically, miraculously and immaculately conceived, could not be; but they contradict themselves when they hold a vacant place near Mohammed's tomb for the body of Isa after his second coming as a forerunner to Mohammed and Doomday. (Pilgrimage ii. 89.)

[FN#389] A diviner, priest, esp. Jewish, and not belonging to the tribe of Levi.

[FN#390] Again the coarsest word ""Khara."" The allusion is to the
vulgar saying, ""Thou eatest skite!"" (i.e. thou talkest nonsense).
Decent English writers modify this to, ""Thou eatest dirt:"" and Lord
Beaconsfield made it ridiculous by turning it into ""eating sand.""
[FN#391] These silly scandals, which cause us only to smile, excite
Easterns to fury. I have seen a Moslem wild with rage on hearing a
Christian parody the opening words of the Koran, ""Bismillahi 'l-
Rahmáni 'l-Rahím, Mismish wa Kamar al-din,"" roughly translated,

""In the name of Allah, the Compassionating, the Compassionate! Apricots and marmalede."" The idea of the Holy Merde might have been suggested by the Hindus: see Mandeville, of the archiprotopapaton (prelate) carrying ox-dung and urine to the King, who therewith anoints his brow and breast, &c. And, incredible to relate, this is still practiced after a fashion by the Parsis, one of the most progressive and the sharpest witted of Asiatic races.

[FN#392] Meaning that he had marked his brow with a cross (of ashes?) as certain do on Ash Wednesday.

[FN#393] Syria, the ""left-hand land"" as has before been explained. The popular saying about its people is ""Shámi shúmi!""—the Syrian is small potatoes (to render the sense Americanicè). Nor did Syrus, the slave in Roman days, bear the best of names. In Al-Hijaz the Syrian is addressed ""Abú Shám"" (Father of Syria) and insulted as ""Abuser of the Salt"" (a traitor). Yet many sayings of Mohammed are recorded in honour of Syria, and he sometimes used Syriac words. Such were ""Bakh, bakh"" (=euge, before noticed), and ""Kakh,"" a congener of the Latin Cacus and Caca which our day has docked to ""cack."" (Pilgrimage iii. 115)

[FN#394] Koran xiv. 34. ""They (Unbelievers) shall be thrown therein (i.e., the House of Perdition=Hell); and an unhappy dwelling shall it be.""

[FN#395] The leg-cut is a prime favourite with the Eastern Sworder, and a heavy two-handed blade easily severs a horse's leg.

[FN#396] Mohammed repeatedly declared (Koran lxi.) that the Christians had falsified the passage (""I go to my Father and the Paraclete shall come,"" John xvi. 7) promising the advent of the Comforter, (ibid. xiv. 20; xv. 26) by substituting the latter word for glorious, renowned, i.e., Ahmed or Mohammed=the praised one. This may have been found in the Arabic translation of the Gospels made by Warakah, cousin to Mohammed's first wife; and hence in Koran lxi. we find Jesus prophesying of an Apostle ""whose name shall be Ahmad."" The word has consequently been inserted into the Arabic Gospel of Saint Barnabas (Dabistan iii. 67). Moslems accept the Pentateuch, the Psalter and the Gospel; but assert (Koran, passim.) that all extant copies have been hopelessly corrupted, and they are right. Moses, to whom the Pentateuch is attributed, notices his own death and burial—""the mair the miracle,"" said the old Scotch lady. The ""Psalms of David"" range over a period of some five hundred years, and there are three Isaiahs who pass with the vulgar for one. The many apocryphal Gospels, all of which have been held genuine and canonical at different times and in different places, prove that the four, which are still in use, were retained because they lack the manifest absurdities of their discarded rivals.

[FN#397] Arab. "" Labbayka; "" the Pilgrimage-cry (Night xxii.) which in Arabic is,

Labbayk' Allahumma, Labbayk'!
Lá Sharíka lake, Labbayk'!
Inna 'l-hamda w'al ni'amata lake wa'l mulk!
Labbayk' Allahumma, Labbayk'!

Some add ""Here am I, and I honour Thee, the son of Thy two slaves; beneficence and good are all between Thy hands.""With the ""Talbiyah"" the pilgrims should bless the Prophet, pray Allah to grant Heaven and exclaim, ""By Thy mercy spare us from the pains of Hell-fire!"" (Pilgrimage iii. 232.) Labbayka occurs in the verses attributed to Caliph Ali; so labba=he faced, and yalubbu=it faces (as one house faces another); lastly, he professed submission to Allah; in which sense, together with the verbal noun ""Talbiyah,"" it is used by Al- Hanri (Pref. and Ass. of Su'adah).

[FN#398] Arab. ""Kissís"" (plur. Kusús) from .

[FN#399] Koran ii. The ""red cow"" is evidently the ""red heifer"" of
Barnabas, chaps. vii.

[FN#400] Arab. ""Al-Jásalík""= .

[FN#401] This is from the first ""Gospel of Infancy,"" wherein Jesus said to his mother, ""Verily I am Jesus, the Son of God, the Word which thou hast brought forth, as the Angel Gabriel did declare unto thee; and my Father hath sent me to save the world"" (chaps. i. 2.). The passage is virtually quoted in the Koran (chaps. iii. 141), of course omitting "" the Son of God""

[FN#402] Mohammed allowed his locks to grow down to his ear-lobes but never lower.

[FN#403] Arab. ""Lisám"" I have explained as a covering for the lower face, made by drawing over it the corner of the head-kerchief (Pilgrimage i. 346). The Lisám of the African Tawárik hoods the eyes so that a man must turn up his face to see, and swathes all the lower half, leaving only the nose exposed. And this is worn by many men by night as well as by day, doubtless to avoid the evil eye. The native Sultans of Darfur, like those of Bornu and others further west, used white muslin as a face-wrap: hence, too, the ceremonies when spitting, etc., etc. The Kúfiyah or head-kerchief of the Arabs soon reached Europe and became in Low Latin Cuphia; in Spanish Escofia; in Ital. Cuffia or Scuffia; in French Escoffion, Scofion (Reine Marguerite) Coëffe (une pellicule, marque de bonheur) Coiffe and Coife, &c.; the Scotch Curch or Coif, opposed to the maiden snood, and, lastly our Sergeant-at-Law's Coif. Littré, the Learned, who in erudition was né coiffé, has missed this obvious derivation.

[FN#404] ""Cutting,"" throughout the book, alludes to the scymitar with which Arabs never give point; and ""thrusting"" to the footman's spear and the horseman's lance.

[FN#405] A popular phrase, I repeat, for extreme tenor and consternation.

[FN#406] The name usually applies to a well-known district and city of Al Yaman, where ""Koss the eloquent"" was bishop in Mohammed's day: the Negiran of D'Herbelot. Here, however, it is the Syrian Najrán (Nejrân of Missionary Porter's miserable Handbook), now a wretched village near the volcanic Lajjá, about one hundred and twenty miles direct south of Damascus and held by Druzes and Christians.

[FN#407] The Kantár (quintal) of 100 ratls (Ibs.) =98-99 Ibs. avoir.

[FN#408] Arab. ""Juráb (bag) mi'adat- ih (of his belly),"" the ""curdling of the testicles"" in fear is often mentioned.

[FN#409] Clearly alluding to the magic so deeply studied by mediæval Jews.

[FN#410] Arab. ""Sahákah,"" lit. rubbing. The Moslem Harem is a great school for this ""Lesbian (which I would call Atossan) love ""; but the motive of the practice lies deeper. As amongst men the mixture of the feminine with the masculine temperament leads to sodomy, so the reverse makes women prefer their own sex. These tribades are mostly known by peculiarities of form and features, hairy cheeks and upper lips, gruff voices, hircine odour and the large projecting clitoris with erectile powers known to the Arabs as ""bazar"" hence Tabzír=circumcision or amputation of such clitoris. Burckhardt (Prov. 436) translates "" Bazarah"" by slut or wench. He adds "" it originally signifies the labia which the Cairenes also entice Zambúr and which are cut off in girlhood."" See also Lane, Lex. s.v.; Tabzír. Both writers confuse excision of the nymphæ with circumcision of the clitoris (Zambúr) Al-Siyúti (Kitab al-Izá' fi'Ilm al-Nikah) has a very interesting chapter on Sapphic venery, which is well known to Europe as proved by such works as ""Gamiani,"" and ""Anandria ou Confessions de Mademoiselle Sappho, avec la Clef,"" Lesbos, 1718. Onanism is fatally prevalent: in many Harems and girls' schools tallow candles and similar succedanea are vainly forbidden and bananas when detected are cut into four so as to be useless; of late years, however, China has sent some marvellous artificial phalli of stuffed bladder, horn and even caoutchouc, the latter material of course borrowed from Europe.

[FN#411] This is considered a powerful aphrodisiac in the East. Hence male devotees are advised to avoid tile ""two reds,"" i.e. meat and wine; while the ""two reds,"" which corrupt women, are gold and saffron, that is perfumery. Hence also the saying of Mohammed:— ""Perfumes for men should have scent and not colour; for women should have colour and not scent."" (Mishkát al-Masábíh ii. 361.)


[FN#412] These are the ""Hibás"" or thin cords of wool which the
Badawi binds round his legs, I believe to keep off cramp.
(Pilgrimage iii. 78).

[FN#413] Crying out ""La iláha illa 'llah."" (There is no god but the
God.); technically called ""Tahlíl.""

[FN#414] i.e. Men, angels and devils, the ""Triloka"" (triple people) of the Hindus. Alamín (plur.), never Alamayn (dual), is the Triregno denoted by the papal Tiara, the three Christian kingdoms being Heaven, Hell and Purgatory.

[FN#415] Matrahinna or Mit-Rahinah is a well-known village near Memphis, the name being derived from the old Egyptian Minat-ro- hinnu, the port at the mouth of the canal. Let me remark that two of these three words, ""Minat"" and ""Ru,"" are still common in "" Aryan"" Persian.

[FN#416] Kirámat, a sign, a prodigy, opposed to Mu'ujizah, a miracle wrought by a prophet. The Sufis explain this thaumaturgy by Allah changing something of Nature's ordinary course in favour of an especial worshipper, and, after a fashion, this is Catholic doctrine (See Dabistan, iii. 173).

[FN#417] Koran, x. 25, ""until the earth receive its vesture and be adorned with various plants.""

[FN#418] i.e. the young hair sprouting on the boy's cheek.

[FN#419] A fighter for the faith and now a title which follows the name, e.g. Osmán Páshá Ghází, whom the English press dubbed ""Ghazi Osman.""

[FN#420] That is the King of Constantinople.

[FN#421] Cassia fistularis, a kind of carob: "" Shambar"" is the
Arab. form of the Persian "" Chambar.""

[FN#422] Koran, ii. 149. Hence the vulgar idea that Martyrs are still alive in the flesh. See my Pilgrimage (ii. 110 and elsewhere) for the romantic and picturesque consequences of that belief. The Commentators (Jalál al-Dín, etc.) play tricks with the Koranic words, "" they (martyrs) are not dead but living"" (iii. 179) by placing the happy souls in the crops of green birds which eat of the fruits and drink of the waters of Paradise; whereas the reprobates and the (very) wicked are deposited in black birds which drain the sanies and the boiling waters of Hell. Amongst the Greeks a body remaining entire long after death suggests Anathema Maranatha: it is the contrary with Catholic Christians (Boccaccio iv. 5, of the Pot of Basil). Concerning this creed see Maundrell, Letter of 1698.

[FN#423] Tor is ""Mount Sinai"" in the Koran (xcv. 1). I have only to repeat my opinion concerning the present site so called: ""It is evident that Jebel Serbal dates only from the early days of Coptic Christianity; that Jebel Musa, its Greek rival, rose after the visions of Helena in the fourth century; whilst the building of the Convent by Justinian belongs to A.D 527. Ras Safsáfah, its rival to the north, is an affair of yesterday, and may be called the invention of Robinson; and Jebel Katerina, to the south is the property of Rüppell"" (Midian Revisited i., 237). I would therefore call the ""Sinaitic"" Peninsula, Peninsula of Paran in old days and Peninsula of Tor (from its chief port) in our time. It is still my conviction that the true Mount Sinai will be found in Jabal Aráif, or some such unimportant height to the north of the modern Hajj- road from Suez to Akabah. Even about the name (which the Koran writes ""Sainá"" and ""Sínín"") there is a dispute: It is usually derived from the root ""Sanah""=sentis, a bush; but this is not satisfactory. Our eminent Assyriologist, Professor Sayce, would connect it with ""Sin,"" the Assyrian Moon- god as Mount Nebo with the Sun-god and he expects to find there the ruins of a Lunar temple as a Solar fane stands on Ba'al Zapuna (Baal Zephon) or the classical Mount Casius.

[FN#424] Alluding to the miracle of Aaron's rod (the gift of Jethro) as related in the Koran (chapts. vii. 1., xx., etc.), where the Egyptian sorcerers threw down thick ropes which by their magic twisted and coiled like serpents.

[FN#425] Arab. ""Ayát"" lit. ""signs,"" here ""miracles of the truth,"" 1. c. Koranic versets as opposed to chapters. The ranks of the enemy represent the latter, sword-cuts the former—a very persuasive mode of preaching.

[FN#426] Lane (M. E. chapt.. iii.) shows by a sketch the position of the worshipper during this ""Salám"" which is addressed, some say, to the guardian angels, others suppose to all brother-believers and angels.

[FN#427] i.e., where the Syrians found him.

[FN#428] i.e., Dedianus Arabised; a name knightly and plebian.

[FN#429] In such tales the Wazir is usually the sharp-witted man, contrasting with the ""dummy,"" or master.

[FN#430] Carrier-pigeons were extensively used at this time. The Caliph Al-Násir li-Díni lláh (regn. A.H. 575=1180) was, according to Ibn Khaldún, very fond of them. The moderns of Damascus still affect them. My successor, Mr. Consul Kirby Green, wrote an excellent report on pigeon-fancying at Damascus. The so-called Maundeville or Mandeville in A. D. 1322 speaks of carrier-pigeons in Syria as a well-known mode Of intercourse between lord and lord.

[FN#431] Mohammed who declared ""There is no monkery in Al-Islam,"" and who virtually abolished the priest, had an especial aversion to the shaveling (Ruhbán). But the ""Gens æterna in quâ nemo nascitur"" (Pliny v. 17) managed to appear even in Al-lslam, as Fakirs,, Dervishes, Súfis, etc. Of this more hereafter.

[FN#432] i.e. her holiness would act like a fascinating talisman.

[FN#433] The ""smoking out"" practice is common amongst the Arabs: hence Marshal Pelissier's so- called "" barbarity."" The Public is apt to forget that on a campaign the general's first duty is to save his own men by any practice which the laws of fair warfare do not absolutely forbid.

[FN#434] i.e. Mohammed, who promised Heaven and threatened Hell.

[FN#435] Arab. ""Ahr"" or ""ihr,"" fornication or adultery, i.e., irreligion, infidelity as amongst the Hebrews (Isaiah xxiii.17).

[FN#436] A sign of defeat.

[FN#437] In English ""last night"": I have already noted that the Moslem day, like the Jewish and the Scandinavian, begins at sundown; and ""layl "" a night, is often used to denote the twenty- four hours between sunset and sunset, whilst ""yaum,"" a day, would by us be translated in many cases ""battle-day.""

[FN#438] Iterum the ""Himalayan Brothers.""

[FN#439] Again, Mohammed who promised Good to the Good, and vice versâ.

[FN#440] They are sad doggrel like most of the pièces d'occasion inserted in The Nights.

[FN#441] Here ""Kahwah"" (coffee) is used in its original sense of strong old wine. The derivation is ""Akhá""=fastidire fecit, causing disinclination for food, the Matambre (kill- hunger) of the Iberians. In old days the scrupulous called coffee ""Kihwah"" in order to distinguish it from 'Kakwah,"" wine.

[FN#442] i.e. Mohammed, a common title.

[FN#443] That is, fatal to the scoffer and the impious.

[FN#444] Equivalent to our ""The Devil was sick,"" etc.

[FN#445] i.e. to the enemy: the North American Indians (so called) use similar forms of ""inverted speech""; and the Australian aborigines are in no way behind them.

[FN#446] See Vol. i., p. 154 (Night xvi.).

[FN#447] Arab. ""Sauf,"" a particle denoting a near future whereas
""Sa-"" points to one which may be very remote.

[FN#448] From the root ""Shanh""=having a fascinating eye, terrifying. The Irish call the fascinater ""eybitter"" and the victim (who is also rhymed to death) ""eybitten.""

[FN#449] i.e., not like the noble-born, strong in enduring the stress of fight.

[FN#450] i.e., of Abraham. For the Well Zemzem and the Place of Abraham see my Pilgrimage (iii. 171-175, etc.), where I described the water as of salt-bitter taste, like that of Epsom (iii. 203). Sir William Muir (in his excellent life of Mahomet, I. cclviii.) remarks that ""the flavour of stale water bottled up for months would not be a criterion of the same water freshly drawn;"" but soldered tins-full of water drawn a fortnight before are to be had in Calcutta and elsewhere after Pilgrimage time; and analysis would at once detect the salt.

[FN#451] Racing was and is a favourite pastime with those hippomanists, the Arabs; but it contrasts strongly with our civilised form being a trial of endurance rather than of speed. The Prophet is said to have limited betting in these words, ""There shall be no wagering save on the Kuff (camel's foot), the Hafir (hoof of horse, ass, etc.) or the Nasal (arrow-pile or lance head).""

[FN#452] In the Mac. Edit. ""Arman""=Armenia, which has before occurred. The author or scribe here understands by ""Cæsarea"" not the old Turris Stratonis, Herod's city called after Augustus, but Cæsareia the capital of Cappadocia (Pliny, vi. 3), the royal residence before called Mazaca (Strabo).

[FN#453] An idiom meaning ""a very fool.""

[FN#454] i.e. Kána (was) má (that which) was (kána).

[FN#455] A son being ""the lamp of a dark house.""

[FN#456] When the Israelites refused to receive the Law (the souls of all the Prophets even those unborn being present at the Covenant), Allah tore up the mountain (Sinai which is not mentioned) by the roots and shook it over their heads to terrify them, saying, ""Receive the Law which we have given you with a resolution to keep it"" (Koran chaps. xlx. 170). Much of this story is from the Talmud (Abodah Sar. 2, 2, Tract Sabbath, etc.) whence Al-Islam borrowed so much of its Judaism, as it took Christianity from the Apocryphal New Testament. This tradition is still held by the Israelites, says Mr. Rodwell (p. 333) who refers it to a misunderstanding of Exod. xix. 17, rightly rendered in the E. version ""at the nether part of the mountain.""

[FN#457] Arab. ""Azghán"" = the camel-litters in which women travel.

[FN#458] i.e. to joy foes and dismay friends.

[FN#459] Whose eyes became white (i.e. went blind) with mourning for his son Joseph (Koran, chaps. xii. 84). He recovered his sight when his face was covered with the shirt which Gabriel had given to the youth after his brethren had thrown him into the well.",[],0,Richard F.

135,135,This Is How A Heart Breaks,"[Verse 1]
Don't you wanna go for a ride
Just keep your hands inside
And make the most out of life
Now don't you take it for granted
Life is like a mean machine
It made a mess outta me
It left me caught between
Like an angry dream I was stranded
I was stranded

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I'm steady but I'm starting to shake
And I don't know how much more I can take

[Chorus]
Well this is it now
Everybody get down
This is all I can take
This is how a heart breaks
You take a hit now
You feel it break down
Make you stay wide awake
This is how a heart breaks

[Verse 2]
Don't you wanna go for a ride
Down to the other side
Feels so good you could cry
Now won't you do what I told you
I remember when you used to be shy
Yeah, once we were so fine, you and I
Why you gotta make it so hard on me?
It's hard on me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I'm sorry but it's not a mistake
And I'm running, but you're getting away

[Chorus]
Well this is it now
Everybody get down
This is all I can take
This is how a heart breaks
You take a hit now
You feel it break down
Make you stay wide awake
This is how a heart breaks
Well this is how a heart breaks

[Verse 3]
You're not the best thing that I knew
Never was, never cared too much for all this hanging around
It's just the same thing all the time
Never get what I want, never get too close to the end of the line
You're just the same thing that I knew
Back before the time when I was running for you

[Chorus]
Hell this is it now
Everybody get down
This is all I can take
This is how a heart breaks
You take a hit now
You feel it break down
Make you stay wide awake
This is how a heart breaks
Hell this is it now
Everybody get down
This is all I can take
This is how a heart breaks
You take a hit now
You feel it break down
Make you stay wide awake
This is how a heart breaks

138,138,Somebody's Hero,"She's never pulled anybody from a burning building
She's never rocked Central Park
To a half a million fans screaming out her name
She's never hit a shot to win the game

She's never left her footprints on the moon
She's never made a solo hot air balloon
Ride around the world
No, she's just your everyday average girl
(But)

She's somebody's hero
A hero to her baby with a skinned-up knee
A little kiss is all she needs

The keeper of the Cheerios
The voice that brings Snow White to life
Bedtime stories every night
And that smile lets her know
She's somebody's hero

She didn't get a check
Every week like a nine-to-fiver
But she's been a waiter and a cook and a taxi driver
For twenty years there at home
Until the day her girl was grown
Giving all her love to her was her life's ambition

But now her baby's moving on
And she'll soon be missing her
But not today
Those are tears of joy runnin' down her face

She's somebody's hero
A hero to her daughter in her wedding dress
She gave her wings to leave the nest

It hurts to let her baby go down the aisle
She walks right by
Looks back into her mother's eyes
And that smile lets her know
She's somebody's hero

Thirty years have flown right past
Her daughter's staring at
All the photographs of her mother
And she wishes she could be like that
Oh but she already is

She's somebody's hero
A hero to her mother in a rockin' chair
She runs a brush through her silver hair
The envy of the nursing home

She drops by every afternoon
Feeds her mama with a spoon
And that smile lets her know
Her mother's smile lets her know
She's somebody's hero","['shes', 'never', 'pull', 'anybody', 'from', 'a', 'burn', 'build', 'shes', 'never', 'rock', 'central', 'park', 'to', 'a', 'half', 'a', 'million', 'fan', 'scream', 'out', 'her', 'name', 'shes', 'never', 'hit', 'a', 'shoot', 'to', 'win', 'the', 'game', 'shes', 'never', 'leave', 'her', 'footprints', 'on', 'the', 'moon', 'shes', 'never', 'make', 'a', 'solo', 'hot', 'air', 'balloon', 'ride', 'around', 'the', 'world', 'no', 'shes', 'just', 'your', 'everyday', 'average', 'girl', 'shes', 'somebodys', 'hero', 'a', 'hero', 'to', 'her', 'baby', 'with', 'a', 'skinnedup', 'knee', 'a', 'little', 'kiss', 'be', 'all', 'she', 'need', 'the', 'keeper', 'of', 'the', 'cheerios', 'the', 'voice', 'that', 'bring', 'snow', 'white', 'to', 'life', 'bedtime', 'stories', 'every', 'night', 'and', 'that', 'smile', 'let', 'her', 'know', 'shes', 'somebodys', 'hero', 'she', 'didnt', 'get', 'a', 'check', 'every', 'week', 'like', 'a', 'ninetofiver', 'but', 'shes', 'be', 'a', 'waiter', 'and', 'a', 'cook', 'and', 'a', 'taxi', 'driver', 'for', 'twenty', 'years', 'there', 'at', 'home', 'until', 'the', 'day', 'her', 'girl', 'be', 'grow', 'give', 'all', 'her', 'love', 'to', 'her', 'be', 'her', 'lifes', 'ambition', 'but', 'now', 'her', 'baby', 'move', 'on', 'and', 'shell', 'soon', 'be', 'miss', 'her', 'but', 'not', 'today', 'those', 'be', 'tear', 'of', 'joy', 'runnin', 'down', 'her', 'face', 'shes', 'somebodys', 'hero', 'a', 'hero', 'to', 'her', 'daughter', 'in', 'her', 'wed', 'dress', 'she', 'give', 'her', 'wing', 'to', 'leave', 'the', 'nest', 'it', 'hurt', 'to', 'let', 'her', 'baby', 'go', 'down', 'the', 'aisle', 'she', 'walk', 'right', 'by', 'look', 'back', 'into', 'her', 'mother', 'eye', 'and', 'that', 'smile', 'let', 'her', 'know', 'shes', 'somebodys', 'hero', 'thirty', 'years', 'have', 'fly', 'right', 'past', 'her', 'daughters', 'star', 'at', 'all', 'the', 'photograph', 'of', 'her', 'mother', 'and', 'she', 'wish', 'she', 'could', 'be', 'like', 'that', 'oh', 'but', 'she', 'already', 'be', 'shes', 'somebodys', 'hero', 'a', 'hero', 'to', 'her', 'mother', 'in', 'a', 'rockin', 'chair', 'she', 'run', 'a', 'brush', 'through', 'her', 'silver', 'hair', 'the', 'envy', 'of', 'the', 'nurse', 'home', 'she', 'drop', 'by', 'every', 'afternoon', 'feed', 'her', 'mama', 'with', 'a', 'spoon', 'and', 'that', 'smile', 'let', 'her', 'know', 'her', 'mother', 'smile', 'let', 'her', 'know', 'shes', 'somebodys', 'hero']",303,Jamie O’Neal,Jamie O'Neal,2005,"[89, 78, 60, 59, 54, 51, 53, 59, 61, 72, 78, 82, 85, 92, 90, 90, 99]",17,Somebody's Hero,https://open.spotify.com/track/2iVkOIwx8qzVGlju9Hy4yY,2iVkOIwx8qzVGlju9Hy4yY,spotify:track:2iVkOIwx8qzVGlju9Hy4yY,Brave,2Xkv3hze4Ext0BO0FDyjOs,spotify:album:2Xkv3hze4Ext0BO0FDyjOs,Jamie O'Neal,6sQVeggRv1AhrMzuCjhCZe,spotify:artist:6sQVeggRv1AhrMzuCjhCZe,221.425,11.0,39.0,2005-01-01,0.493,0.735,1.0,-6.0120000000000005,1.0,0.0432,0.0771,0.0,0.107,0.626,164.05900000000003,"['contemporary country', 'country', 'country dawn', 'country road']",[],1.0

Maybe I'm the one to blame

Maybe all my luck's washed down the drain

Hear the sound of the falling rain
Coming down like an Armageddon flame (Hey!)
The shame, the ones who died without a name
Hear the dogs howling out of key

And bleed, the company lost the war today

Hear the drum pounding out of time

To find the money's on the other side
Can I get another Amen? (Amen!)
There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (Hey!)
A gag, a plastic bag on a monument

I try to focus my attention
But I feel so A-D-D
I need some help, some inspiration (But it's not coming easily)

Read some Byron, Shelley, and Keats
Recited it over a hip-hop beat
I'm having trouble saying what I mean
With dead poets and drum machines
You know I had some studio time booked
But I couldn't find the killa hook
Now you've gone and raised the bar right up
Nothing I write is ever good enough

Precious and fragile things
Need special handling
My God what have we done to you
We always tried to share

But words left unspoken
Left us so brittle
There was so little left to give

Shouldn't know suffering

If God has a master plan

I hope it's your eyes He's seeing through

[Chorus]
Things get damaged
Things get broken
I thought we'd manage
But words left unspoken
Left us so brittle
There was so little left to give

I pray you learn to trust
Have faith in both of us
And keep room in your hearts for two

Things get damaged
Things get broken
I thought we'd manage
But words left unspoken
Left us so brittle
There was so little left to give

If you were mine
I'd be your everything
And you'd be the only thing
That I would ever need

If you were mine
I would tell everyone
That you are the only one
That I could ever want

[Verse 1:]
Ohhh yeaaa

Everything I dreamed about
Everything that I talked about
One thing I can't live without

I wanna get closer to you
Can't stand being far away
Knowing that you don't
Feel the same way
Watching him bring
Tears to your eyes

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
Ohhh yeaaa

All words I sing about
All the letters I write about
Only thing I wanna hear about
Is when I get closer to you

I know that there is someone else
But he's only thinking of himself
Doesn't make any sense for
You to be lonely

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Ohhh yeaaa

Let me be the one you share
Your hopes and dreams with
You'll never be alone again
'Cuz I will hold you endlessly

Please don't be afraid
To let your broken heart guide you
Into these open arms that
Long to surround you, baby

When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try, you'll never know
Just what you're worth

I don't care, that's what Ricky says

I don't care
I just wanna be yours
I know I told you I'd never love you the way that I did again after all that you did to me
But I got to say

I don't care
I just wanna be yours
And I tried everything in my power to never ever say
""please come back to me""
But I got to say

You promised me would always be you'd never let me go
You took the ring and all the things that came with being my girl
The tragedy as I walked through that door
He had your feet up over the seat
All I heard was screaming

It was like a movie, too real to me, that just can't be my bride to be. NO
I was shocked this could be, never thinking one day I'd take this BLOW BLOW BLOW
I was starting to feel like I should kill everything that was moving. WHOA
I've never been in hell like this
Somebody wake me up!

I don't care
I just wanna be yours
I know I told you I'd never love you the way that I did again after all that you did to me
But I got to say

I don't care
I just wanna be yours
And I tried everything in my power to never ever say ""please come back to me""
But I got to say

The crazy part was that he just kept going cause she was the only one that had noticed me
Staring into the eyes that I will one day call my baby
How could I have fallen so in love with someone I've known for years
And not even know that she'd be the one to reveal my worst fears

It was like a movie, too real to me, that just can't be my bride to be. NO
I was shocked this could be, never thinking one day I'd take this BLOW BLOW BLOW
I was starting to feel like I should kill everything that was moving. WHOA

I don't care
I just wanna be yours
And I tried everything in my power to never ever say ""please come back to me""
But I got to say

I didn't mean to do all those things to you
Tell me what to do to make it up to you
I'll do everything, anything you want me to

I didn't mean to do all those things to you
Tell me what to do to make it up to you
I'll do everything, anything you want me to

Should I leave, should I go, should I break apart / My Mama said you would break my heart
I can't believe you a sleaze, you a slut, a ho, now you wanna have a change of heart
Damn
Who would have thought that you would have deceived me, love of my life, you my queen like Eve
And you didn't even tell me you leavin', I had to hear about it on a scandal on TV
Now who this man creapin' in the back door, 'bout to hit him with the FO FO FO
I know you keep sayin' that you lovin' me so, but why the hell you crushin' him for

147,147,Let Me Hold You,"[Intro: J.D., Bow Wow]
Y'all know what this is
This what you need to do girl...
So, So, Def (Let me hold you)

[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
I been watchin' you for a minute
Come through here so sweet scented
In life girl you need me in it, I'm determined to win it
I know what you need, I know what's wrong
I know how to make it tight
Everything will be all right if ya (Let me hold you)
And introduce you to my world
And introduce you to the better side
Of life that you ain't been seeing girl
I'ma show you where it's at
And I'ma show you how to get it
All you got do is be with it and (Let me hold you)
Down like a real man's supposed to
I never would have approached you if I ain't have intentions on doing good
See dude you with is so fooled to me girl your so cool
And all I'm asking you to do is (Let me hold you)
Down like a best friend, two homies in the game
When you cry I wanna feel your pain; no secrets, no games
All excitement, nothin' plain; keep you happy, that's my aim
And all you gotta do girl is (Let me hold you)

[Hook: Omarion]
In my arms in my mind all the time I wanna
Keep you right by my side 'til I die I'm gonna
Hold you down and make sure everything is right with you
You can never go wrong if you let me hold you
Down like a real friend's supposed to
I'm trying to show you
The life of somebody like you should be living
Ohhhhh, baby baby
You could never go wrong if you let me hold you

[Verse 2: Bow Wow]
I'ma keep you up on what's poppin'
And shake you fresh to death
When we hit the mall we can ball 'til there's no more left
I know you ain't used to it but you gon get used to it
'Cause that's the only way I'm a do you and let me
(Let me hold you)
All my homies think I'm trippin' 'cause I got you a pad
See they just mad 'cause they ain't get you; they ain't get you
Scorpio is your sign and girl your so fine
And I would do whatever in no time - no shine
Its what you're coming with but I'ma change all that
Rearrange that, put you in the Range all black
With the rims to match, phone attached
TV's in the back, how you gon say no to that? Huh
(Let me hold you)
Niggas look at me like now here you go
Really bout to blow some doe
But ain't nobody did it before so why is you so go hold it
'Cause I believe this was meant to be
I just gotta work at it like a crack addict up in rehab

[Hook: Omarion]
(Let me hold you)
In my arms in my mind all the time I wanna
Keep you right by my side 'til I die I'm gonna
Hold you down and make sure everything is right with you
You can never go wrong if you let me hold you
Down like a real friend's supposed to
I'm trying to show you
The life of somebody like you should be living
Ohhhhh, baby baby
You could never go wrong if you let me hold you
(Let me hold you)

[Bridge: Bow Wow & Omarion]
Down-down around, Atlanta-lanta, fa-found
And everybody know now what I'm tryna do
I say down-down around, Atlanta-lanta, fa-found
I'm just tryna get you to (Let me hold you)
Down-down around, Atlanta-lanta, fa-found
And everybody know now what I'm tryna do
I say down-down around, Atlanta-lanta, fa-found
I'm just tryna get you to (to let me hold you)

[Hook: Omarion]
(Let me hold you)
In my arms in my mind all the time I wanna
Keep you right by my side 'til I die I'm gonna
Hold you down and make sure everything is right with you
You can never go wrong if you let me hold you

The life of somebody like you should be living

Oh, you like the way that sounds?

[Verse 1]
Little Jimmy Jackson is jackinl up his Bronco
He's gonna lay a little rubber later on at the truck pull
And all the girls are gettin' pretty, they're sprayin' on the White Rain
Yeah, they're gonna get a rowdy tonight down at the football game

[Chorus]
Yeah, we let it rip
When we got the money, let it roll
If we got the gas it gets wild
Yeah, but that's the way we get down
In a hicktown

[Verse 2]
Well, you can see the neighbors butt crack nailin' on his shingles
And his woman smokin' Pall Malls watchin' Laura Ingalls
And Granny's gettin' lit, she's headin' out to bingo
Yeah, my buddies and me are goin' muddin' down on Blue Hole Road

You know, you know

[Chorus]
Yeah, we let it rip
When we got the money, let it roll
If we got the gas it gets wild
Yeah, but that's the way we get down
In a hicktown

[Interlude]
Oh, stand on it

[Verse 3]
We hear folks in the city party in Martini Bars
And they like to show off in their fancy foreign cars
Out here in the boondocks we buy beer at Amoco
And crank our Kraco speakers with that country radio

[Chorus]
We let it rip
When we got the money, let it roll
If we got the gas it gets wild
Yeah, but that's the way we get down
In a hicktown

Oh, oh

Yeah, we let it rip
When we got the money, let it roll
If we got the gas it's buckwild
Yeah, but that's the way we get down

Yeah, it's the way we get down
Yeah, in hicktown
Yeah, in hicktown

Aw, we ain't finished yet

[Outro]
Got your country boys and your redneck girls
It's the party heard 'round the world
Right here in hicktown
In hicktown
The whole town's gettin' down

[Chorus]
Yeah, we let it rip
When we got the money, let it roll
If we got the gas it's buckwild
Yeah, but that's the way we get down
In a hicktown
In a hicktown

With all of this fortune, what am I doin' single
Sometimes I tell myself, ""Man, get out and mingle""
You don't have to be alone, you need someone to love
But bein famous sometimes it's hard to find someone to trust
But the hell with that this time, I'm gonna treat myself

150,150,Right Here,"[Verse 1]
I know I've been mistaken
But just give me a break and see the changes that I've made
I've got some imperfections
But how can you collect them all and throw them in my face

[Chorus]
But you always find a way
To keep me right here waiting
You always find the words to say
To keep me right here waiting
And if you chose to walk away
I'd still be right here waiting
Searching for the things to say
To keep you right here waiting

[Verse 2]
I hope you're not intending
To be so condescending, it's as much as I can take
But you're so independent
You just refuse to bend so I keep bending until I break

[Chorus]
But you always find a way
To keep me right here waiting
You always find the words to say
To keep me right here waiting
If you chose to walk away
I'd still be right here waiting
Searching for the things to say
To keep you right here waiting

[Bridge]
I've made a commitment
I'm willing to bleed for you
I needed fulfillment
I found what I need in you
Why can't you just forgive me?
I don't want to relive all the mistakes I've made
Along the way
But I always find a way
To keep you right here waiting
I always find the words to say
To keep you right here waiting

[Chorus]
But you always find a way
To keep me right here waiting
You always find the words to say
To keep me right here waiting
And if I chose to walk away
Would you be right here waiting?
Searching for the things to say
To keep me right here waiting","['i', 'know', 'ive', 'be', 'mistake', 'but', 'just', 'give', 'me', 'a', 'break', 'and', 'see', 'the', 'change', 'that', 'ive', 'make', 'ive', 'get', 'some', 'imperfections', 'but', 'how', 'can', 'you', 'collect', 'them', 'all', 'and', 'throw', 'them', 'in', 'my', 'face', 'but', 'you', 'always', 'find', 'a', 'way', 'to', 'keep', 'me', 'right', 'here', 'wait', 'you', 'always', 'find', 'the', 'word', 'to', 'say', 'to', 'keep', 'me', 'right', 'here', 'wait', 'and', 'if', 'you', 'choose', 'to', 'walk', 'away', 'id', 'still', 'be', 'right', 'here', 'wait', 'search', 'for', 'the', 'things', 'to', 'say', 'to', 'keep', 'you', 'right', 'here', 'wait', 'i', 'hope', 'youre', 'not', 'intend', 'to', 'be', 'so', 'condescend', 'its', 'as', 'much', 'as', 'i', 'can', 'take', 'but', 'youre', 'so', 'independent', 'you', 'just', 'refuse', 'to', 'bend', 'so', 'i', 'keep', 'bend', 'until', 'i', 'break', 'but', 'you', 'always', 'find', 'a', 'way', 'to', 'keep', 'me', 'right', 'here', 'wait', 'you', 'always', 'find', 'the', 'word', 'to', 'say', 'to', 'keep', 'me', 'right', 'here', 'wait', 'if', 'you', 'choose', 'to', 'walk', 'away', 'id', 'still', 'be', 'right', 'here', 'wait', 'search', 'for', 'the', 'things', 'to', 'say', 'to', 'keep', 'you', 'right', 'here', 'wait', 'ive', 'make', 'a', 'commitment', 'im', 'will', 'to', 'bleed', 'for', 'you', 'i', 'need', 'fulfillment', 'i', 'find', 'what', 'i', 'need', 'in', 'you', 'why', 'cant', 'you', 'just', 'forgive', 'me', 'i', 'dont', 'want', 'to', 'relive', 'all', 'the', 'mistake', 'ive', 'make', 'along', 'the', 'way', 'but', 'i', 'always', 'find', 'a', 'way', 'to', 'keep', 'you', 'right', 'here', 'wait', 'i', 'always', 'find', 'the', 'word', 'to', 'say', 'to', 'keep', 'you', 'right', 'here', 'wait', 'but', 'you', 'always', 'find', 'a', 'way', 'to', 'keep', 'me', 'right', 'here', 'wait', 'you', 'always', 'find', 'the', 'word', 'to', 'say', 'to', 'keep', 'me', 'right', 'here', 'wait', 'and', 'if', 'i', 'choose', 'to', 'walk', 'away', 'would', 'you', 'be', 'right', 'here', 'wait', 'search', 'for', 'the', 'things', 'to', 'say', 'to', 'keep', 'me', 'right', 'here', 'wait']",280,Staind,Staind,2005,"[98, 84, 80, 78, 79, 73, 68, 73, 73, 58, 55, 79, 79, 80, 85, 86, 89, 88, 77, 85]",20,Right Here,https://open.spotify.com/track/6S7mmHgyWOG6pIYuL4YrfQ,6S7mmHgyWOG6pIYuL4YrfQ,spotify:track:6S7mmHgyWOG6pIYuL4YrfQ,Chapter V,15ZipIr7RjbpSCNMIaoQoF,spotify:album:15ZipIr7RjbpSCNMIaoQoF,Staind,5KDIH2gF0VpelTqyQS7udb,spotify:artist:5KDIH2gF0VpelTqyQS7udb,253.933,12.0,57.0,2005-08-08,0.49200000000000005,0.6459999999999999,10.0,-5.334,0.0,0.0303,0.0013599999999999999,2.2100000000000002e-05,0.121,0.214,112.228,"['alternative metal', 'nu metal', 'post-grunge', 'rap rock', 'rock']",[],1.0

I tear my heart open, I sew myself shut
My weakness is that I care too much
And my scars remind me that the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel

[Verse 1]
Drunk and I'm feeling down
And I just wanna be alone
I'm pissed cause you came around
Why don't you just go home
'Cause you channel all your pain
And I can't help you fix yourself
You're making me insane
All I can say is

[Chorus]
I tear my heart open, I sew myself shut
My weakness is that I care too much
And our scars remind us that the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel

[Verse 2]
I tried to help you once
Against my own advice
I saw you going down
But you never realized
That you're drowning in the water
So I offered you my hand
Compassions in my nature
Tonight is our last stand

And my scars remind us that the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel

I’m drunk and I’m feeling down
And I just want to be alone
You shouldn’t have come around
Why don’t you just go home
'Cause you’re drowning in the water
And I tried to grab your hand
I left my heart open
But you didn’t understand
But you didn’t understand
Go fix yourself!

Coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine
Gotta gotta be down because I want it all
It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag
Now they're going to bed and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his

[Pre-Chorus]
Chest now, he takes off her dress now
Let me go
I just can't look, it's killing me
And taking control

[Chorus]
Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside

I can make you new friends
Or get you fired from work

Been making the bars lots of big money
And helping white people dance

But college, now that was a ball

I got blamed at your wedding reception
For your best man's embarrassing speech
And also for those
Naked pictures of you at the beach
I've influenced kings and world leaders
I helped Hemmingway write like he did
And I'll bet you a drink or two that I can make you
Put that lampshade on your head

Cause since the day I left Milwaukee
Lynchburg and Bordeaux, France
Been making a fool out of folks just like you
And helping white people dance

Five of the PM rolls around
There's a little old joint outside of town
I only got time for a couple of beers
And a jukebox song ringing in my ears

The next you know
The bartenders pouring
Shots are flowing
Got me stoning
All I really know is that I should be going
But I'm soaking up the moment

[Chorus:]
I'm all jacked up
All jacked up
Don't believe I've ever had this much
One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Time sure flies
When you're all jacked up

[Verse 2:]
It was getting mighty close to nine o'clock
What the hell
I have one more shot

Then I winked at a boy at the end of the bar
Guess I mighta musta gone a little too far
Cause a big 'ol girl walked outta the blue

Ten foot, two
With a bad attitude
Stepped right up
And knocked out my tooth
Guess I had it coming I deserved the due

[Chorus:]
Cause I was all jacked up
All jacked up
Don't believe I've ever had this much

One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Don't start no stuff
When you're all jacked up

[Bridge:]
Don't have to go home
But you can't stay here
That's what they said when I got my last beer

[Verse 3:]
Oh my God, it's 2:00
I can't find my keys and my trucks locked
So I grabbed a tire tool
And I broke my window

Hurt my elbow
Got me in though
Two foot later
Backed into the light pole
All the town folk got a good show

[Chorus:]
All jacked up
All jacked up
Don't believe I've ever had this much

One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Don't drive your truck
When you're all jacked up

Jacked up
(All jacked up, all jacked up)
Ooh, oooh, oooooh

One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Don't start no stuff
When you're all jacked up

One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Don't drive your car
Don't start no stuff in no bar
Hell
I wouldn't even tell anybody where you are
When you're all jacked up

Ayo, you
You that just flipped on the CD player
I just wanna inform you that when you got somebody good
You hold on to 'em
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Must be nice
Havin' someone who understands the life you live
Must be nice
Havin' someone who's slow to take and quick to give
Must be nice
Havin' someone who sticks around when the rough times get thick
Someone whose smile is bright enough to make the projects feel like a mansion
Must be nice
Havin' someone who loves you despite your faults
Must be nice
Havin' someone who talks the talk but also walks the walk
Must be nice
Havin' someone who understands that a thug has feelings too
Someone who loves you for sho'
You just remember to never let 'em go

[Hook]
'Cause even when your hustlin' days are gone
She'll be by your side still holdin' on
And even when those 20's stop spinnin'
And all those gold-diggin' women disappear
She'll still be here

[Verse 2]
Must be nice
Havin' someone you can come home to from a long day of work
Must be nice
Havin' someone you don't have to show they know exactly where it hurts
Must be nice
Havin' someone who trusts you despite what they've heard
Someone as mighty as a lion but still as gentle as a bluebird
Must be nice
Havin' someone you don't have to tell you don't want to be alone
Must be nice
Havin' someone you can grow old with until God calls ya'll home
Must be nice
Havin' someone who understands that a thug has feelings too
Someone who loves you for sho'
You never let 'em go

[Hook]
'Cause even when your hustlin' days are gone
She'll be by your side still holdin' on
And even when those 20's stop spinnin'
And all those gold-diggin' women disappear
She'll still be here
'Cause even when your hustlin' days are gone
She'll be by your side still holdin' on
And even when those 20's stop spinnin'
And all those gold-diggin' women disappear
She'll still be here
'Cause even when your hustlin' days are gone
She'll be by your side still holdin' on
And even when those 20's stop spinnin'
And all those gold-diggin' women disappear
She'll still be here

160,160,Pimpin' All Over The World,"[Hook: Bobby Valentino]
(Oh yeah) The fancy cars
The women and the caviar
You know who we are
Cause we're pimpin' all over the world
The fancy cars
The women and the caviar
You know who we are
Cause we're pimpin' all over the world

[Intro: Ludacris]
Sing it, hoes (The world, the world, The world)
All over the world, baby
It's only right that I share my experiences with y'all
Cause I've been places you'll never imagine
But I'mma start it at home
When I see a girl I like
I walk straight up to them and I'm like (ugh)

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Hey girl how you doin'?
You are the woman that I'm really pursuin'
And I would like to get to know ya, can you gimme ya name?
If you jot down ya number you'll get mine in exchange (heyy)
See I'm the man of this town
And I hope you wouldn't mind if I showed you around
So when you go to certain places you'll be thinkin of me
We got, people to meet and many places to see (heyy)
Mm, I'm really diggin' ya lips
But be careful where you walkin' when you swingin' them hips
Cause I'm kinda concerned that you'll be causin' a crash
With your traffc jam booty heads pausin' so fast (heyy)
I would'nt trade you for the world I swear it
I like ya hair and every style that you wear it
And how the colors cordinate with your clothes
From your manicured nails to your pedicured toes

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Yeah, you hear the song so dance
Don't always think I'm tryna get in your pants
Cause see me my pimpin's in 3D
I'm takin' you places you only see on TV
Tryna show ya how you livin' is trife
How many guys you know can bring the travel channel to life
One day we on the Autobahn, swervin drivin
Next day we in the sun on the Virgin Islands
If you with me ain't no time to sleep
Especially at Wet Willies on Miami Beach
But I drive you off and pay you no attention
If make it to Atlantas Brina Brothers convention
Then jump in the car and just ride for hours
Makin' sure I don't miss the homecoming at Howard
Hawaii to D.C. it's plenty women to see
So if yo ass don't show up it's more women for me (heyy)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
I'm in New York at the Puerto Rican Day Parade
Then at night I'm in New Orleans drinkin' hand grenades
Outnumbered by the dozens at the jazz fest
In Mardi Gras all the women tryna show me they chest (heyy)
I'm in Jamaica spendin massive bucks
While the ladies all beggin' me to mashatuck
I had, sad beginnings when I rapped with no fans
Now it's all happy endings on my lap in Japan (heyy)
I used to think that it was way too cold
'Til I went to Canada and saw some beautiful hoes
Now I hit the Caribana every year in Toronto
Then fly to Illinois to get a taste of Chicago (ugh)
Oh yet and still
You wouldn't believe your eyes if you went to Brazil
(But where the best at?) Ain't no need of even askin' brah
The best women all reside in Africa, and that's real

[Hook]

[Ludacris]
Sing it, hoes (The world, the world, the world)

[Outro: Katt Williams]
Pimpin' pimpin' pimpin'
Ladies and gentlemen as we ride out
Could we have all the real pimps
Please put both of your pinky fingers high in the air?
Now ladies look around with me
Let's see if we can weed some of these niggas out
Cause it's no way that all these niggas could be pimpin'
Now if you happen to see a nigga
With two sweat patches up under his arms
Look like he been swimmin' in shoulder height water
Please tell that nigga ""put your hands down""
If you smell like you been at work all day and your car
Please ""put your hands down""
Now look up at the pinky fingers that are still in the air
If you see him ashy around the knuckles
Like the nigga wash half of his hands
And lotion three quarters of his body
Please say ""put your hands down""
If your spinnin' rims spin counter clockwise, you are not pimpin'
If you are dancin' on the dancefloor
And you look to your left and your right
And you do not see a woman in sight
Guess what? You guessed it - you are not pimpin
If your Vodka and Cranberry is really really dark like blood
That's because you didn't order Vodka buddy
That's why it's three dollars a glass
""Put your hands down""
Now look down, look down
I need everybody to pull up your pants leg one time
Okay, you see the nigga with the white socks
NOT PIMPIN!
Sorry unless you part of the ""Beat It"" entorauge
If your shoes have a buckle on...","['the', 'women', 'and', 'the', 'caviar', 'you', 'know', 'who', 'we', 'be', 'cause', 'be', 'pimpin', 'all', 'over', 'the', 'world', 'the', 'fancy', 'cars', 'the',

161,161,Mississippi Girl,"[Intro]
Well, it's a long way from Star, Mississippi
To the big stage I'm singing on tonight
And sometimes the butterflies still get me
When I'm in the spotlight

[Verse 1]
And some people seem to think that I've changed
That I'm different than I was back then
But in my soul, I know that I'm the same way
That I've really always been

[Chorus]
'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
Just 'cause everybody knows her name
Ain't big-headed from a little bit of fame
I still like wearing my old ball cap
Ride my kids around piggy back
They might know me all around the world
But y'all, I'm still a Mississippi girl

[Verse 2]
Well, I spent a few weeks in California
They put my face on the big movie screen
But that don't mean I've forgotten where I came from
That's just me chasing dreams, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
Just 'cause everybody knows her name
Ain't big-headed from a little bit of fame
I still like wearing my old ball cap
Ride my kids around piggy back
They might know me all around the world
But y'all, I'm still a Mississippi girl

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
Just 'cause everybody knows her name
Ain't big-headed from a little bit of fame
I still like wearing my old ball cap
Ride my kids around piggy back
They might know me all around the world
But y'all, I'm still a Mississippi girl

Mississippi girl
Oh

Mississippi girl

Long ago
Just like the hearse you die to get in again
We are so far from you
Burning on
Just like the match you strike to incinerate
The lives of everyone you know
And what's the worst you take
From every heart you break
And like the blade you stain
Well I've been holding on tonight

[Chorus]
What's the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight

[Verse 2]
Came a time
When every star fall
Brought you to tears again
We are the very hurt you sold
And what's the worst you take
From every heart you break
And like the blade you stain
Well I've been holding on tonight

[Chorus]
What's the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
Well, if you carry on this way
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight

[Bridge]
Can you hear me?
Are you near me?
Can we pretend to leave and then
We'll meet again
When both our cars collide

[Chorus]
What's the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
And if you carry on this way
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight

Yes, she blew through the door like TNT
Put her hand on her hip, pointed a finger at me

The DJ played P Diddy

167,167,As Good As I Once Was,"[Verse 1]
She said, ""I've seen you in here before.""
I said, ""I've been here a time or two.""
She said, ""Hello, my name is Bobby Jo
Meet my twin sister Betty Lou
And we're both feeling kinda wild tonight
You're the only cowboy in this place
And if you're up for a rodeo
I'll put a big Texas smile on your face""
I said, ""Girls,""

[Chorus]
I ain't as good as I once was
I got a few years on me now
But there was a time back in my prime
When I could really lay it down
And if you need some love tonight
Then I might have just enough
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was

[Verse 2]
I still hang out with my best friend Dave
I've known him since we were kids at school
Last night he had a few shots
Got in a tight spot hustling a game of pool
With a couple of redneck boys
One great big bad biker man
I heard David yell across the room
""Hey buddy, how 'bout a helping hand?""
I said, ""Dave,""

[Chorus]
I ain't as good as I once was
My, how the years have flown
But there was a time back in my prime
When I could really hold my own
But if you wanna fight tonight
Guess those boys don't look all that tough
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was

[Bridge]
I used to be hell on wheels
Back when I was a younger man
Now my body says, ""You can't do this boy""
But my pride says, ""Oh, yes you can""

[Chorus]
I ain't as good as I once was
That's just the cold hard truth
I still throw a few back, talk a little smack
When I'm feeling bullet proof
So don't double dog dare me now
Cause I'd have to call your bluff
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was
May not be good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was","['she', 'say', 'ive', 'see', 'you', 'in', 'here', 'before', 'i', 'say', 'ive', 'be', 'here', 'a', 'time', 'or', 'two', 'she', 'say', 'hello', 'my', 'name', 'be', 'bobby', 'jo', 'meet', 'my', 'twin', 'sister', 'betty', 'lou', 'and', 'be', 'both', 'feel', 'kinda', 'wild', 'tonight', 'youre', 'the', 'only', 'cowboy', 'in', 'this', 'place', 'and', 'if', 'youre', 'up', 'for', 'a', 'rodeo', 'ill', 'put', 'a', 'big', 'texas', 'smile', 'on', 'your', 'face', 'i', 'say', 'girls', 'i', 'aint', 'as', 'good', 'as', 'i', 'once', 'be', 'i', 'get', 'a', 'few', 'years', 'on', 'me', 'now', 'but', 'there', 'be', 'a', 'time', 'back', 'in', 'my', 'prime', 'when', 'i', 'could', 'really', 'lay', 'it', 'down', 'and', 'if', 'you', 'need', 'some', 'love', 'tonight', 'then', 'i', 'might', 'have', 'just', 'enough', 'i', 'aint', 'as', 'good', 'as', 'i', 'once', 'be', 'but', 'im', 'as', 'good', 'once', 'as', 'i', 'ever', 'be', 'i', 'still', 'hang', 'out', 'with', 'my', 'best', 'friend', 'dave', 'ive', 'know', 'him', 'since', 'we', 'be', 'kid', 'at', 'school', 'last', 'night', 'he', 'have', 'a', 'few', 'shots', 'get', 'in', 'a', 'tight', 'spot', 'hustle', 'a', 'game', 'of', 'pool', 'with', 'a', 'couple', 'of', 'redneck', 'boys', 'one', 'great', 'big', 'bad', 'biker', 'man', 'i', 'hear', 'david', 'yell', 'across', 'the', 'room', 'hey', 'buddy', 'how', 'bout', 'a', 'help', 'hand', 'i', 'say', 'dave', 'i', 'aint', 'as', 'good', 'as', 'i', 'once', 'be', 'my', 'how', 'the', 'years', 'have', 'fly', 'but', 'there', 'be', 'a', 'time', 'back', 'in', 'my', 'prime', 'when', 'i', 'could', 'really', 'hold', 'my', 'own', 'but', 'if', 'you', 'wanna', 'fight', 'tonight', 'guess', 'those', 'boys', 'dont', 'look', 'all', 'that', 'tough', 'i', 'aint', 'as', 'good', 'as', 'i', 'once', 'be', 'but', 'im', 'as', 'good', 'once', 'as', 'i', 'ever', 'be', 'i', 'use', 'to', 'be', 'hell', 'on', 'wheel', 'back', 'when', 'i', 'be', 'a', 'younger', 'man', 'now', 'my', 'body', 'say', 'you', 'cant', 'do', 'this', 'boy', 'but', 'my', 'pride', 'say', 'oh', 'yes', 'you', 'can', 'i', 'aint', 'as', 'good', 'as', 'i', 'once', 'be', 'thats', 'just', 'the', 'cold', 'hard', 'truth', 'i', 'still', 'throw', 'a', 'few', 'back', 'talk', 'a', 'little', 'smack', 'when', 'im', 'feel', 'bullet', 'proof', 'so', 'dont', 'double', 'dog', 'dare', 'me', 'now', 'cause', 'id', 'have', 'to', 'call', 'your', 'bluff', 'i', 'aint', 'as', 'good', 'as', 'i', 'once', 'be', 'but', 'im', 'as', 'good', 'once', 'as', 'i', 'ever', 'be', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'good', 'as', 'i', 'once', 'be', 'but', 'im', 'as', 'good', 'once', 'as', 'i', 'ever', 'be']",359,Toby Keith,Toby Keith,2005,"[66, 56, 51, 48, 42, 40, 38, 32, 32, 29, 28, 30, 34, 35, 37, 43, 48, 52, 55, 80]",20,As Good As I Once Was,https://open.spotify.com/track/7G6l2FtQyRhQgYgut2I6i8,7G6l2FtQyRhQgYgut2I6i8,spotify:track:7G6l2FtQyRhQgYgut2I6i8,Honkytonk University,4SOpJPkpAO8FT9n4sbmnoT,spotify:album:4SOpJPkpAO8FT9n4sbmnoT,Toby Keith,2bA6fzP0lMAQ4kz6CF61w8,spotify:artist:2bA6fzP0lMAQ4kz6CF61w8,227.84,12.0,64.0,2005-01-01,0.68,0.87,5.0,-4.461,1.0,0.0393,0.266,0.0,0.109,0.6459999999999999,119.075,"['contemporary country', 'country', 'country road', 'oklahoma country']",[],1.0

Out in the street, they call it murder

[Verse 1]
Welcome to Jamrock
Camp where the thugs dem camp at
Two pound ah weed inna van back
It inna ya hand bag, ya knapsack
It inna ya backpack
The smell ah give your girlfriend contact
Some boy nuh know dis
Dem only come around like tourist
On the beach with a few club sodas
Bedtime stories, and pose like dem name Chuck Norris
And don't know the real hardcore
Cause Sandals ah nuh back to
Di thugs dem will do whe dem got to
And won't think twice to shot you
Don't make dem spot you, unless you carry guns a lot too
A bare tuff ting come at you
When Trenchtown man stop laff an lock  arrf traffic
Then dem wheel and pop off and dem start clap it
With the pin file down an it ah beat rapid
Police coming inna jeep and dem cyaan stop it
Some say dem ah playboy, ah playboy rabbit
*Funny man ah* get dropped like a bad habit
So nuh bodah pose tuff if you don't have it
Rastafari stands alone

[Chorus]
Welcome to Jamrock
Welcome to Jamrock
Out in the street, they call it murder

[Verse 2]
Welcome to Jam down
Poor people ah dead at random
Political violence, cyaan done
Pure ghost and phantom
The youth dem get blind by stardom
Now the kings of kings ah call
Old man to pickney, so wave unuh hand if you with me
To see this sufferation sick me
Dem suit no fit me,
To win election dem trick we
Then dem don't do no ting at all
C'mon let's face it, a ghetto education's basic
And most ah de youths dem waste it
And when dem waste it
That's when dem take the guns replace it
Then dem don't stand a chance at all
And that's why ah nuff likkle youth have up some fat 'matic
With di extra magazine inna dem back pocket
And ah bleach a night time inna some black jacket
All who nah lock Glocks, ah dem a lock rocket
They will full you up ah current like ah short circuit
Dem a run ah road back which part the cops block it
And from now till a mornin' nuh stop clock it
If dem run outta rounds ah bruck back ratchet

[Chorus]

Mike Jones
Befo' I came up in the game these hoes didn't show no love
They see me in the club and used to treat me like a scrub
They wouldn't holla cause my dollars wasn't swoll enough
I bet they change they mind when them 84's come rollin up
They see that I'm a star, now they wanna sit in my car
Now they wanna count my cheese, smoke my weed and sip my barre now
They used to love to me diss me, now they rush to hug and kiss me now
They tellin' all they friends when I leave how they miss me now
2 8 1, 3 3 oh, 8 0 0 4
Hit Mike Jones up on the low cause Mike Jones about to blow
Befo' the ice was in my grill, before I got my major deal
These hoes wouldn't give a damn if I was heah, geah
Befo' the ice was in my grill, before I got my major deal

I remember back den, most of them hoes couldn't stand me
But now them same hoes beggin me to pull down they panties
A couple of 'em said I was cute but I was just too chubby
Same size a year later the same hoes wanna fuck me
Because they see me paid, pimpin pens, workin my jelly
And I ain't trippin' cause my pockets stick out mo' than my belly
They know I'm paid, livin' laid in the shade
Two slabs in the Escalade with fo' or five estates
Then know that I got it made, I'm a motherfuckin baller she would
Want a nigga now but I ain't got no time to call her
I'ma stall her like she stalled me, now she tryna call me
Bitch I'ma dog yo' hoe ass like you dogged me
I'm Mike Jones, don't act like you don't know the name
Ain't nothin' changed but my change, I'ma stay the same

Ain't nothin' changed but my change, I'ma stay the same

Befo' my paper came, befo' I got my fame
These hoes that's poppin on me now didn't even know my name
They said my flow was lame, they said I had no game
I told 'em all I was fin' to blow they thought I was insane
But then my name started blowin up quick, now they jumpin on my dick
Cause they see me on the rise and oh now my paper thick
But then my name started blowin up quick, now they jumpin on my dick

He died from the bullet of a gun
And now her little boy is gone

[Pre-Chorus 1: Alex]
She said ""Help me, Lord help me""
And she looked up to the sky
And she heard the voice reply

[Chorus: Alex]
When you cry, I cry
I cry along with you
When you smile, I smile
I smile along with you
When you cry, I cry
I cry along with you
When you smile, I smile
I smile along with you

[Verse 2: Flexx]
Another baby left homeless
Abandoned when he was two
So the street side kids at the shopping mall was the family he knew
It's not easy being homeless
Sometimes you have to do what you have to do
And he didn't have a mom or dad to help him get through

[Pre-Chorus 2: Alex]
He said ""Help me, Father help me""
And he looked up to the sky
And he heard the voice reply

[Chorus: Alex & Bay-C]
When you cry, I cry
I cry along with you
When you smile, I smile
I smile along with you
When you cry, I cry
Based on a true story
I cry along with you
When you smile, I smile
Keep yuh head up
I smile along with you

[Bridge: Bay-C]
It was early Sunday morning, me get up ah watch the news
Den me hear say last night a sea view dem kill ah youth

When she tell me, jah jah know it, mash me up, nuh tell me lie
But yuh know say man a thuggist so yuh nuh go see me cry

[Chorus: Alex]
When you cry, I cry
I cry along with you
When you smile, I smile
I smile along with you
When you cry, I cry
I cry along with you
When you smile, I smile

Baby, I see you working hard
I wanna let you know I'm proud
Let you know that I admire what you do
Don't know if I need to reassure you
My life would be purposeless without you
If I want it (you got it)
When I ask you (you provide it)
You inspire me to be better
You challenge me for the better
Baby, sit back and let me pour out my love letter
Let me help you
Take off your shoes
Untie your shoe strings
Take off your cuff links
What you wanna eat, boo?
Let me feed you
Let me run your bathwater
Whatever your desire, I'll supply ya
Sing you a song
Turn the game on
I'll brush your hair
Help you put your durag on
Want a foot-rub?
You want a manicure?
Baby, I'm yours, I wanna cater to you, boy

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Let me cater to you
Cause, baby, this is your day
Do anything for my man
Baby, you blow me away
I got your slippers, your dinner, your dessert and so much more
Anything you want, just let me cater to you
Inspire me from the heart
Can't nothing tear us apart
You're all I want in a man
I put my life in your hands
I got your slippers, your dinner, your dessert and so much more
Anything you want, I wanna cater to you

[Verse 2: Kelly Rowland]
Baby, I'm happy you're home
Let me hold you in my arms
I just wanna take the stress away from you
Making sure that I'm doing my part
Boy, is there something you need me to do?
If you want it (I got it)
Say the word (and I'll try it)
I know whatever, I'm not fulfilling
Another woman is willing
I'm gonna fulfill your mind, body and spirit
I promise ya
I'll keep myself up
Remain the same chick
You fell in love with
I'll keep it tight, I'll keep my figure right
I'll keep my hair fixed, keep rockin' the hottest outfits
When you come home late, tap me on my shoulder, I'll roll over
Baby, I heard you, I'm here to serve you
If it's love you need to give it is my joy
All I wanna do, is cater to you, boy

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Let me cater to you
Cause, baby, this is your day
Do anything for my man
Baby, you blow me away
I got your slippers, your dinner, your dessert and so much more
Anything you want, just let me cater to you
Inspire me from the heart
Can't nothing tear us apart
You're all I want in a man
I put my life in your hands
I got your slippers, your dinner, your dessert and so much more
Anything you want, I wanna cater to you

[Verse 3: Michelle Williams]
I wanna give you my breath, my strength, my will to you
That's the least I can do
Let me cater to you
Through the good, the bad
The ups and the downs
I'll still be here for you
Let me cater to you
Cause you're beautiful
I love the way you are
Fulfill your every desire
Your wish is my command
I wanna cater to my man
Your heart (your heart)
So pure your love shines through
The darkness we'll get through
(So much) So much of me is you (is you)
I wanna cater to my man

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Let me cater to you
Cause baby this is your day
Do anything for my man
Baby, you blow me away
I got your slippers, your dinner, your dessert and so much more
Anything you want, just let me cater to you
Inspire me from the heart
Can't nothing tear us apart
You're all I want in a man
I put my life in your hands
I got your slippers, your dinner, your dessert and so much more

Now it seems to me
That you know just what to say
But words are only words
Can you show me something else
Can you swear to me that you'll always be this way
Show me how you feel
More than ever baby

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be lonely no more
I don't wanna have to pay for this
I don't want to know the lover at my door
It's just another heartache on my list

I don't wanna be angry no more
You know I could never stand for this
So when you tell me that you love me, know for sure
I don't want to be lonely anymore

[Verse 2]
Now it's hard for me
With my heart still on the mend
Open up to me, like you do your girlfriends
And you sing to me and it's harmony
Girl, what you do to me is everything
Make me say anything, just to get you back again
Why can't we just try

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be lonely no more
I don't wanna have to pay for this
I don't want to know the lover at my door
It's just another heartache on my list

I don't wanna be angry no more
You know I could never stand for this
So when you tell me that you love me, know for sure
I don't want to be lonely anymore

What if I was good to you
What if you were good to me
What if I could hold you 'till I feel you move inside me
And what if it was paradise
And what if we were symphonies
What if I gave my all my life to find some way to stand beside you

174,174,Georgia Rain,"Barefoot in the bed 'a your truck
On a blanket lookin' up
Half a moon peekin' down at us
From underneath the clouds
Teenage kids sneakin' out again
Heard the thunder rollin' in
We were fallin' the moment when
It all came pourin' down

The Georgia rain
On the Jasper County clay
Couldn't wash away
What I felt for you that day
Just you and me down an old dirt road
Nothin' in our way
Except for the Georgia rain

Cotton fields remember when
Flash 'a lightnin' drove us in
We were soaked down to the skin
By the time we climbed inside
And I don't remember what was poundin' more
Heart in my chest or the hood of that Ford
As the sky fell in, the storm clouds poured
Worlds away outside

The Georgia rain
On the Jasper County clay
Couldn't wash away
All the love we made
Just you and me down that old dirt road
No one saw a thing
Except for the Georgia rain

Screen door flappin' in the wind
Same ol' house I grew up in
Can't believe I'm back again
After all these years away
You fixed your Daddy's house up nice
I saw it yesterday when I drove by
Looks like you've made youself a real good life
What else can I say

The Georgia rain
On the Jasper County clay
Couldn't wash away

Wake up, wake up

[Verse 1]
There's people talking
They talk about me
They know my name, they think they know everything
But they don't know anything about me

[Verse 2]
Give me a dance floor
Give me a DJ
Play me a record
Forget what they say
'Cause I need to go
Need to get away tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
I put my makeup on a Saturday night
I try to make it happen, try to make it all right
I know I make mistakes, I'm living life day-to-day
It's never really easy, but it's okay

[Chorus]
Wake up, wake up on a Saturday night
Could be New York, maybe Hollywood and Vine
London, Paris, maybe Tokyo
There's something going on
Anywhere I go tonight
Tonight, yeah, tonight

[Verse 3]
The city's restless
It's all around me
People in motion, sick of all the same routines
And they need to go, they need to get away tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
I put my makeup on a Saturday night
I try to make it happen, try to make it all right
I know I make mistakes, I'm living life day-to-day

People all around you everywhere that you go
People all around you, they don't really know you
Everybody watching, like it's some kind of show
Everybody's watching, they don't really know you now
(They don't really know you, they don't really know you)
And forever

Wake up, wake up (Wake up, wake up)
Wake up, wake up (Wake up, wake up)

176,176,Best Of You,"[Intro]
I've got another confession to make, I'm your fool
Everyone's got their chains to break, holdin' you
Were you born to resist or be abused?

[Refrain]
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?

[Verse 1]
Are you gone and on to someone new?
I needed somewhere to hang my head without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have, but had no use
I was too weak to give in, too strong to lose
My heart is under arrest again, but I break loose
My head is giving me life or death, but I can't choose
I swear I'll never give in, I refuse

[Chorus]
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
You trust, you must confess
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Oh, oh oh, oh oh

[Bridge]
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
The life, the love you'd die to heal
The hope that starts the broken hearts
You trust, you must confess

The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?

I've got another confession, my friend, I'm no fool
I'm getting tired of starting again somewhere new
Were you born to resist or be abused?
I swear I'll never give in, I refuse

Monday, hard to wake up
Fill my coffee cup, I'm out the door
Yeah, the freeway's standing still today
It's gonna make me late, and that's for sure

I'm running out of gas and out of time
Never gonna make it there by nine

There's gotta be something more
Gotta be more than this
I need a little less hard time
I need a little more bliss
I'm gonna take my chances
Taking a chance, I might
Find what I'm looking for
There's gotta be something more

Five years and there's no doubt
That I'm burnt out, I've had enough
So now boss man, here's my two weeks
I'll make it short and sweet, so listen up

I believe that happiness is something we create

Yeah, 'cause right now, I need some downtime
To drink some red wine and celebrate
Yeah, Armageddon could be knocking at my door
But I ain't gonna answer, that's for sure

Meals from the shot bar
Or you just wanna quickie with a rap star
Ladies tell the truth, you know I'm cute
But what really turns you on is the rims on my coupe
Before you jump in my whip and you get dropped off
Going to the tele and your getting popped off
I can't stop thinking of the things you do
When you freaking me and I'm freaking you
I said the ice on my neck make the shorties stick
Baby let me fly you in my whip
Stop, slow down baby

That wanna make a girl feel
Make her feel good?
All I wanna know
Is there any boys around

Do I have to tell a nigga how to touch me?
Do I have to tell a nigga how to hold me?
Do I have to tell a nigga when to call me?
Do I have to tell a nigga I'm lonely?
Do I have to feel wrong
When it ain't strong?
Keep my mouth closed?
(huh, huh, huh)
Can't a girl from tha hood find a homie
That ain't just tryna hang around me?

Do I have to show a nigga I'm a woman?
Do I have to apologize for my emotions?
Do I have to tell a nigga what to say to me

Everytime he wanna get next to me?
Do I have to set a full cat black case?
Stroke 'cause he go (mmh girl no)
Can't a chick from tha hood find a homie
That wanna do more than spend money on me?

(Hook)

(Verse 2:)
How come I got a nigga but can't trust him?
Why every answer to my question is a question?
Why can't my nigga be my own lil somethin'?
And every girl on my block can't say they don' bumped wit?

I'm so tired of these so called wanna be hard cold pretenders that (have. no. clue.)
Can't a chick from tha hood find a homie
That I ain't gotta tell how to put it on me?

(Hook)

I got half a smile and zero shame
I got a reflection with a different name

[Pre-Chorus]
Got a brand new blues that I can't explain

[Chorus]
Who did you think I was?

[Verse 2]
Every mornin', when the day begins
I make up my mind, then change it back, again

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been a shifter of the shape I'm in

[Chorus]
Who did you think I was?

[Pre-Chorus]
You got my number, but I always knew the score

[Chorus]
Who did you think I was?

Am I the one who plays the quiet songs?
Or is he the one who turns the ladies on?

Will I keep shining 'til my light is gone?

Carry the weight of the world in the palm of my hand

Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bang me some

Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bang me some

Swisha House, Big Pokey and Paul Wall baby
It's the people's champ, I'm something like a baller
The candy paint dripping off of the old school Impala
I'm with that Big Bank Hank, that Poppi Joe and Box

Trunk bump like chicken pox, turn the bass up just a notch
You see them blades choppin', you see that trunk poppin'
Ho's that diss me in the club, the same ho's in the parking lot boppin'
They see me in the Jag, acting bad with T Ferris

Open mouth and showcase ice, and you gon' see about 20 karats
I'm what they do, you on 5-9 double O
In the Tahoe on 24's, I'm the truth, I got that glow
I'm out that Swisha House with Archie Lee and Couda Bang

Sittin' sideways on swang, the candy paint dripping off the frame
You see me acting bad, I'm showing out and pulling stunts
Say cheese and show my fronts
It's more carrots than Bugs Bunny's lunch
It's Paul Wall baby, I got it made
I got a cup full of that oil, and I'm paid plus I'm sittin' sideways

Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bang me some

What it do, I'm on the block posted up like a mailbox
Slanging licks on the grind, putting money in my socks
A legend in the hood for gold grills and poppin' seals
A icon on the mic for showcasing my verbal skills

I'm in the club posted up with some gang bangers
Still flipping the old school candy Cadillac on swangers
I got a styrofoam white cup full of that drank
Looking for that dank, my hustle game sharp as a shank

Big bank take little bank, 84's and candy paint
Trying to find some 'Honey Love' my macking game is top rank
These ho's peeping me, ear hustling on the side
Eavesdropping my conversation, trying to figure which car I drive

I'm on the scene strapped up like I was bungee jumping
Hit the corner you hear me bumping, look at that cold grillin' woman
The trunks popped up, my music screwed and chopped
I'm the undisputed king of the parking lot, I'm sittin' sideways

Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
Sittin' sideways, boys in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bang me some

Maybe O.J's, ho's be going crazy when they see me
Sittin' sideways on them 24's
Watch ya ho, watch ya money, watch ya clothes
Single women's out the mold, glidin' like a ice skater

Motor like a snot nose
Suicide drop doors, mono blocks, chop mold
Customized deck, cause the mono block stock lows
Sadey Sade, Don Key, Paul Wall in the place

Heads up when you see us, we gon' put it in ya face
Redbones scoutin' together when I blaze
Boys smell lemon haze, I ain't the nigga to settle
I'm that dude with the metal, that get hot as a kettle

From messing 'round with some cat that ain't got it together
Flossing, breaking of the intersection, crossing
Three-wheelin' acting a iz-ass on them Bosses
S.U.C. in the door, M.O.B. on the place
Pull up in the driveway leanin' and I'm sittin'
(I'm sittin')

Take a ride

Its lookin like we're getting there
Over here, comin clear
Place that has no rhymes, or times, or crimes
Just good times
Just good times

Take me away
To a place where the good times good times roll
Don't let me stay
In a place where this hate can steal my soul...

Got myself worked up over nothing today
All the trash is in my head I gotta throw it away
Its alright
Its alright

Its lookin like we're getting there
Over here, comin clear
Place that has no rhymes, or times, or crimes
Just good times
Just good times

Take me away
To a place where the good times good times roll
Don't let me stay
In a place where this hate can steal my soul

This is it, I'm finally here
And all the blurry lines are clear
And everything that I can't see
Seems to make more sense to me
Why the hell can't I just let it go, let it go, yeah

Take me away (away)
Where the good times good times roll (roll)
Don't let me stay (stay)
Where this hate can steal my soul

Let the good times roll
Let the good times roll (take me away)
Let the good times roll (take me away)

185,185,How To Deal,"1st Verse:
Sometimes a man has to choose
And do something he doesnt wanna do
Do i live my life with you as my wife?
Or do i go on and pursue my lifetime dream?
I gotta do this for me
Cuz if I dont I'll probably regret it
But if I do I'll probably regret it
How do I cope?

CHORUS:
How do you cope when
The one you love is with somebody else
And theres nothin you can do about it
How do you deal with
The fact that you had a chance
But you chose to turn away for your career
I gotta take it though its heart-breakin'
Its somethin that I had to do
But nobody said that it would hurt so bad
So how do I live..
How do I deal without you

2nd Verse:
Its killing me to know
That your heart's with me
But you're with him cuz I chose to be
In this industry
Money, shows and hoes come along with
Luxury and pain
Is all you see when you think about it
But this is the life
That I was given
So i have to live it to the fullest
But how do I deal in the meantime
Without you

[Chorus]
SOLO:
How do you deal when
You can't be with the one you love
And the one that you love is with somebody else
(I don't know, I don't know)
And what do you do
When you know she don't love him
And she loves me but she just can't stand loving you far away
(I guess I'm gonna have to just)
You just deal with it, deal with it
(I don't want to have to live with it)
You just deal with it, deal with it
(no, no, no)
You just deal with it, deal with it
(I don't want nobody else loving you)
You just deal with it, deal with it
(I don't want nobody else loving me)

Drop it like it's hot, get to whippin' that back
Girl shake that thing, yeah work that thing
Let me see it go up and down
Rotate that thang, I wanna touch that thang
When you make it go round and round

[Verse 1]
I step up in the club I'm like ""Who you wit?""
G-Unit in the house, yeah that's my clique
Yeah, I'm young, but a nigga from the old school
On the dancefloor a nigga doin old moves
I don't give a fuck, I do what I wan' do
I hit your ass up boy, I done warned you
Better listen when I talk nigga, don't trip
Yo' heat in the car, mines in this bitch
I ain't tryin' to beef, I'm tryin' to get my drink on
And my diamonds, my fitted, and my mink on
I'mma kick it at the bar 'til it's time to go
Then I'mma get in shorty ear and I'mma let her know

[Chorus]
All a nigga really need is a lil' bit
Not a lot baby girl, just a lil' bit
We can head to the crib in a lil' bit
I can show you how I live in a lil' bit
I wanna unbutton your pants just a lil' bit
Take 'em off and pull 'em down just a lil' bit
Get to kissin' and touchin' a lil' bit
Get to lickin' it, a lil' bit

[Verse 2]
This is 50, comin' out your stereo
It's hard to tell though cause I switched the flow
Eyes a little low cause I twist the 'dro
Pockets on swoll cause I move the O's
My neck, my wrist, my ears is froze
Come get your bitch, she on me dawg
She musta heard about the dough
Not Captain c'mon and Save-a-Ho
I get it crunk in the club, I'm off the chain
Number one on the chart all the time mane
When the kid in the house, I turn it out
Keep the dancefloor packed that's without a doubt
But shorty shake that thang like a pro man
She backed it up on me I'm like ""Oh man""
I got close enough to her so I know she could hear
System thumpin', party jumpin', I said loud and clear

[Chorus]
All a nigga really need is a lil' bit
Not a lot baby girl, just a lil' bit
We can head to the crib in a lil' bit
I can show you how I live in a lil' bit
I wanna unbutton your pants just a lil' bit
Take 'em off and pull 'em down just a lil' bit
Get to kissin' and touchin' a lil' bit
Get to lickin' it, a lil' bit

[Bridge]
Baby you got me feelin' right, you heard me?
My momma gone you can spend the night, you heard me?
I ain't playin' I'm tryin' to fuck tonight, you heard me?
Clothes off, face down, ass up, c'mon, ha ha

187,187,Diamonds From Sierra Leone,"[Produced by Kanye West, Devo Springsteen and Jon Brion]

[Intro: Shirley Bassey]
Diamonds are forever
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might
Desert me

[Hook: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid, seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived
'Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
Does he write his own rhymes? Well, sort of, I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask, if you talkin' about classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
Or even a four-track recorder
So it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
Spoil yourself, that's important
If your stripper name ""Porsche"" and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend, her nickname is ""Minivan""
Excuse me, that's just the Henny, man
I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop, I can't, because—

[Hook: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I was sick about awards, couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
Thirty minutes later seein' there's no convincin' him
What more could you ask for? The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though: somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change or the game or the fame
When he came in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
It's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say Kayne
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi, them Folks ain't from Moe Town
Life movin' too fast, I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, you need to go down
My father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call; you got a message, then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yeah, the beat cold, but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like, ""Pssh, we messed up.""
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle 'til we got messed up
In the studio, with Really Doe, yeah, he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question, dog: ""Yo, where Dame at?""
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
""What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man?""
They pray for the death of our dynasty like ""Amen""
R-r-r-r-right here stands a man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands

[Hook: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

188,188,Do You Want Fries With That,"[Verse 1]
I thought that was your voice
I thought that was my car
Now we aren’t ever met before
But I know who you are
You're living in my house
And I'm living in a tent
And don't laugh, this second job of mine
Is paying both our rents
You're out here buying Happy Meals
And I'm eating rice and pintos
You so much as crack a smile at me, man
I'll come through this here window

[Chorus]
Well you took my wife
And you took my kids
And you took that life
That I used to live
My pride, the pool, the boat, my tools, my dreams, the dog, the cat
Yeah I think that's just about everything
Oh I almost forgot
Do you want fries with that?

[Verse 2]
Your ketchup's in the bag
And a check is in the mail
I hope your chicken's raw inside
And I hope your bun is stale
I'm supposed to tell you
""Please come back""
But how about this instead?
I hope you both choke on a pickle
Man, that would tickle me to death
I don't know what you're waiting on
You're holding up the line
Oh man, you aren’t got no change coming back
Are you out of your mind?

[Chorus]
Well you took my wife
And you took my kids
And you took that life
That I used to live
My pride, the pool, the boat, my tools, my dreams, the dog, the cat
Yeah I think that's all there is
Do you want fries with that?

[Chorus]
Well you took my wife
And you took my kids
And you took that life

189,189,Just Want You To Know,"[Verse 1: Nick]
Looking at your picture from when we first met
You gave me a smile that I could never forget
And nothing I could do could protect me from you that night
Wrapped around your finger, always on my mind
The days would blend 'cause we stayed up all night
Yeah, you and I were everything, everything to me

[Chorus]
I just want you to know that I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say I would do it all again
Just want you to know

[Verse 2: AJ]
All the doors are closing I'm trying to move ahead
And deep inside I wish it's me instead
My dreams are empty from the day, the day you slipped away

[Chorus x1]

[Bridge]
That since I lost you, I lost myself
No I can't fake it, there's no one else

[Chorus x1]

'cause I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end

190,190,Help Somebody,"Written by Kip Raines and Jeffrey Steele

Well, Grandaddy was a hillbilly scholar, blue collar of a man
He came from the school where you didn't need nothin'
If you couldn't make it with your own two hands
He was backwoods, backwards, used words like:
""No Sir,"" ""Yes, Ma'am,"" ""By God,"" ""Be darned,""
""Hell yeah, I'm American.""
In all the years he walked this earth
I swear all he did was work
He said: ""The devil dreams on an idle horse
""So you listen to me squirt

""Don't get too high on the bottle
And get right with the Man
Fight your fights, find a grace
And all the things that you can change
And help somebody if you can. ""

Now Granny said: ""Sonny, stick to your ganas
If you believe in something, no matter what
'Cause it's better to be hated for who you are
Than be loved for who you're not. ""
She was five feet of concrete
New York born an' raised on a slick city street
She'd cold-stare you down, stand her ground
Still kickin' and screamin' at 93
I remember just how frail she looked in that hospital bed:
Takin' her last few breaths of life, smilin' as she said:

""Don't get too high on the bottle
Just a little sip ev'ry now and then
Fight your fights, find a grace
And all the things that you can change
And help somebody if you can
And get right with the Man. ""

Instrumental Break
(C'mon now.)

""I never let a cowboy make the coffee.""
Yeah, that's what Granny always said to my Grandad
And he'd say: ""Never tell a joke that ain't that funny more than once.""
And ""if you wanna hear God laugh, tell Him your plans.""

""Don't get too high on the bottle
Get right with the Man, son
Fight your fights, find a grace
And all the things that you can change
And help somebody if you can
And get right with the Man. ""

Yeah
(Get too high.)
(Help somebody if you can.)","['write', 'by', 'kip', 'rain', 'and', 'jeffrey', 'steele', 'well', 'grandaddy', 'be', 'a', 'hillbilly', 'scholar', 'blue', 'collar', 'of', 'a', 'man', 'he', 'come', 'from', 'the', 'school', 'where', 'you', 'didnt', 'need', 'nothin', 'if', 'you', 'couldnt', 'make', 'it', 'with', 'your', 'own', 'two', 'hand', 'he', 'be', 'backwoods', 'backwards', 'use', 'word', 'like', 'no', 'sir', 'yes', 'maam', 'by', 'god', 'be', 'darn', 'hell', 'yeah', 'im', 'american', 'in', 'all', 'the', 'years', 'he', 'walk', 'this', 'earth', 'i', 'swear', 'all', 'he', 'do', 'be', 'work', 'he', 'say', 'the', 'devil', 'dream', 'on', 'an', 'idle', 'horse', 'so', 'you', 'listen', 'to', 'me', 'squirt', 'dont', 'get', 'too', 'high', 'on', 'the', 'bottle', 'and', 'get', 'right', 'with', 'the', 'man', 'fight', 'your', 'fight', 'find', 'a', 'grace', 'and', 'all', 'the', 'things', 'that', 'you', 'can', 'change', 'and', 'help', 'somebody', 'if', 'you', 'can', '', 'now', 'granny', 'say', 'sonny', 'stick', 'to', 'your', 'ganas', 'if', 'you', 'believe', 'in', 'something', 'no', 'matter', 'what', 'cause', 'its', 'better', 'to', 'be', 'hat', 'for', 'who', 'you', 'be', 'than', 'be', 'love', 'for', 'who', 'youre', 'not', '', 'she', 'be', 'five', 'feet', 'of', 'concrete', 'new', 'york', 'bear', 'an', 'raise', 'on', 'a', 'slick', 'city', 'street', 'shed', 'coldstare', 'you', 'down', 'stand', 'her', 'grind', 'still', 'kickin', 'and', 'screamin', 'at', '93', 'i', 'remember', 'just', 'how', 'frail', 'she', 'look', 'in', 'that', 'hospital', 'bed', 'takin', 'her', 'last', 'few', 'breaths', 'of', 'life', 'smilin', 'as', 'she', 'say', 'dont', 'get', 'too', 'high', 'on', 'the', 'bottle', 'just', 'a', 'little', 'sip', 'evry', 'now', 'and', 'then', 'fight', 'your', 'fight', 'find', 'a', 'grace', 'and', 'all', 'the', 'things', 'that', 'you', 'can', 'change', 'and', 'help', 'somebody', 'if', 'you', 'can', 'and', 'get', 'right', 'with', 'the', 'man', '', 'instrumental', 'break', 'i', 'never', 'let', 'a', 'cowboy', 'make', 'the', 'coffee', 'yeah', 'thats', 'what', 'granny', 'always', 'say', 'to', 'my', 'grandad', 'and', 'hed', 'say', 'never', 'tell', 'a', 'joke', 'that', 'aint', 'that', 'funny', 'more', 'than', 'once', 'and', 'if', 'you', 'wanna', 'hear', 'god', 'laugh', 'tell', 'him', 'your', 'plan', 'dont', 'get', 'too', 'high', 'on', 'the', 'bottle', 'get', 'right', 'with', 'the', 'man', 'son', 'fight', 'your', 'fight', 'find', 'a', 'grace', 'and', 'all', 'the', 'things', 'that', 'you', 'can', 'change', 'and', 'help', 'somebody', 'if', 'you', 'can', 'and', 'get', 'right', 'with', 'the', 'man', '', 'yeah']",333,Van Zant,Van Zant,2005,"[93, 71, 67, 66, 74, 76, 76, 81, 87, 92, 91]",11,Help Somebody,https://open.spotify.com/track/4Bt4QcQ5BxzzspvFLKvbB9,4Bt4QcQ5BxzzspvFLKvbB9,spotify:track:4Bt4QcQ5BxzzspvFLKvbB9,Get Right With The Man,1TlZtsAIXuZWNP8i7gKXsp,spotify:album:1TlZtsAIXuZWNP8i7gKXsp,Van Zant,6ZRkCThyw6syuSOAGT7lY1,spotify:artist:6ZRkCThyw6syuSOAGT7lY1,253.453,11.0,35.0,2005-05-10,0.499,0.659,7.0,-5.727,1.0,0.0323,0.00117,7.35e-06,0.128,0.41100000000000003,158.112,"['country rock', 'southern rock']",[],1.0

Are you ready, boots?
Start walkin'
Yee-haw, come on, let’s go

[Verse 1]
You keep saying you got something for me (Uh)
Well, officer, I don’t mind to say you do
Now you're looking right where I thought you’d be looking
Legs come in handy when the law's in front of you

[Chorus]
These boots are made for walking
And that’s just what they’ll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you

[Verse 2]
You believe you've stopped me for a reason (Uh)
Now I’m pretending my bending's just for fun
You keep playing where I got you playing, yeah
These double 'D’ initials work to run

[Chorus]
These boots are made for walking
And that’s just what they’ll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you

[Post-Chorus]
I’m the girl with the good boys who don’t mean you no harm
This diamond way with Hazard County charm
There ain't no crime in havin' a little fun

[Bridge]
Swerve my stride
Bat my sexy eyes
Where my boots at? (Haha)
Strut ya stuff, come on

[Breakdown]
Hey y'all
Wanna come and see something? (Uh-uh, uh-uh)
Can’t touch, can I get a hand clap? For the way I work my back
Tick-tock, all around the clock, drop it
Push ya tush, like that
Can I get a suueey? (Suueey)
Can I get a yee-haw? (Yee-haw)

[Verse 3]
You keep thinking what you shouldn't be thinking
Another two buttons down till you kissing the ground
I’m not gonna send you back home till you're cryin'
But Uncle Jesse, he sure is gonna be proud

[Chorus]
These boots are made for walking
And that’s just what they’ll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you
These boots are made for walking
And that’s just what they’ll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you

[Post-Chorus]
Come on, boots!
Start walking
Come on, ladies!

[Breakdown]
Hey y'all
Wanna come and see something? (Uh-uh, uh-uh)

Havin' big dreams of me ridin' in the Bentley Continental
While me copin' you a cute lil' Mercedes
And I know I got the block hot
But until I make it happen for you baby I will not stop

Visions of your herb blowin' in the wind from a drop top
Like a baller, like a true shot caller
The homie, Trey Songz, tippin' all day long if he have to

Come and take a lil' cruise with a G through the Chi-town streets
'Cause you feelin' me under inspiration whenever I'm

194,194,Summer Nights,"I'm feelin' good (feelin' alright tonight)
I'm feelin' good now (yeah)
It's all good in the neighborhood homes
Lil Rob

I feel good, I feel alright
Cruisin' through my neighborhood on a warm summer night
I feel good.. that's right
I feel good now (somethin' about these summer nights)

[Hook]
(Whoa!) Summer days just sittin' around
But when the sun goes down, I'll be ready to party
(Whoa! Hey!) Ain't nothin' like them summer nights
Keep the top on drop, all the girls lookin' hot
Head to bo-lo and we just don't stop
Party until the mornin' light (whoa!)
Ain't nothin' like them summer nights

[Verse 1]
I just kicked it at home, I polished up the chrome
Called the ruca on the phone, let her know I'm home alone
It's, 7:30 and the sun's goin' down
It's a, summer night and the fun's goin' down
I pick her up and she looks all dolled up (she look good)
Sittin passenger in my rag Impala (yeah)
I let her know that she looks beautiful to me
The world's an ugly place but she is such a sight to see
The kind of woman, that would put up a fight for me
The kind that wants, to spend the summer nights with me
The temp was 80 and I'm cruisin with my lady
Playin some Ralfi Pagan, ooh baby baby
I see my homeboys and they're cruisin in their ride (hey wassup homes)
With their ladies, sittin by their side
People think we look crazy but I think we look classy
But then again, that's only if you ask me

[Hook]
(Whoa!) Summer days just sittin' around
But when the sun goes down, I'll be ready to party
(Whoa! Hey!) Ain't nothin' like them summer nights
Keep the top on drop, all the girls lookin' hot
Head to bo-lo and we just don't stop
Party until the mornin' light (whoa!)
Ain't nothin' like them summer nights

[Verse 2]
My homeboys throwin' a backyard boogie, so everybody
Gets together to unwind relax and have a fun time
The DJ's spinnin', so I grab the mic' and be like
Ain't nothin' like them summer nights
The party's packed with beautiful women
And the gang of the homies, that wanna get with 'em
And they'll say anything just to hit 'em
And it's usually a nice summer night when they did 'em
I don't know, it must be, something in the air
Can't help but have a good time because the feelin is there
To some people, the feelin' is rare
They're at the pad sayin' God damn, I wish I was there
To have a drink, have a toke and hook up
With someone fine but the kind that looks up
Gotta keep some pisto' in the cup
Party until the sun comes up or we give up

[Hook]
(Whoa!) Summer days just sittin' around
But when the sun goes down, I'll be ready to party
(Whoa! Hey!) Ain't nothin' like them summer nights
Keep the top on drop, all the girls lookin' hot
Head to bo-lo and we just don't stop
Party until the mornin' light (whoa!)
Ain't nothin' like them summer nights

[Verse 3]
Them summer nights can keep a smile on your face
Gotta try to have a good time with this life, otherwise it's just a waste
Either way I'm gonna party just in case
Like Prince partied like it was 99 in 87, 88
I couldn't ask for no better weather
I'm right next to the Pacific, to be specific
The candy paint job, glows under the moonlight
As I close out my summer night and say goodnight
It's time to put the top up and park it
Drop it, unplug the ground, roll up the windows and lock it
Walk in the pad and fall into bed
As she lays on my chest to rest her sleepy head
And we do this all night long, from dusk 'til dawn
But it's not quite the same when summer nights are gone
But even when they're gone it won't be long
Eight more months then once again it's on

[Hook]
(Whoa!) Summer days just sittin' around
But when the sun goes down, I'll be ready to party
(Whoa! Hey!) Ain't nothin' like them summer nights
Keep the top on drop, all the girls lookin' hot
Head to bo-lo and we just don't stop
Party until the mornin' light (whoa!)
Ain't nothin' like them summer nights

How long before I get in?
Before it starts, before I begin?
How long before you decide?
Before I know what it feels like?
Where to, where do I go?
If you never try, then you'll never know
How long do I have to climb
Up on the side of this mountain of mine?

[Verse 2]
Look up, I look up at night
Planets are moving at the speed of light
Climb up, up in the trees
Every chance that you get
Is a chance you seize
How long am I gonna stand
With my head stuck under the sand?
I'll start before I can stop
Before I see things the right way up

[Hook]
All that noise, and all that sound
All those places I got found
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand

[Verse 3]
Ideas that you'll never find
All the inventors could never design
The buildings that you put up
Japan and China all lit up
The sign that I couldn't read
Or a light that I couldn't see
Some things you have to believe
But others are puzzles, puzzling me

[Hook]
All that noise, and all that sound
All those places I got found
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground

Listening to this song kinda make a nigga want something

Cause right now I'll be don strong on ya

By running game and throwing your dreams
Get in your brain suit your game
Ease your pain and show you things
Sit you on some leather seats while blowing green
And switching lanes

She five foot seven a hundred and thirty nine pounds
Thirty six twenty four thirty eight pretty fine brown
Bad lil broad I ain't seen her in a minute
Since the All-Star game and I'm still tryin to hit it
Got a baby for this nigga that I used to sell things
He caught a fed case and he ain't leave her no change
She sold all his jewels she sold all his cars
Now she dancing in the shaker club stripping for the stars
Sliding down the pole slow drop it to a split
Pussy popping on a handstand man she the shit
She still looking tight though
Still built right though
Run my game right and after the club
She might go back to the telly with me
Shake her jelly with me
Let my people bust on her face and her belly with me
I got Lil Webbie with me and he ain't hating
We some players in this bitch so baby stop hesitating

Now I can tell from your size that that pussy is fire
So I'm here and willing to give you whatever it require
For you to lay down on your back and then open your thighs
Long sharp deep and wide have you rolling your eyes
You a big fine horse I had no choice but to try it
Look like it's worth a couple g's but ain't some shit I buy
Let me whisper in your ear again I ain't gon lie
I might share a lil meal just don't tell nobody
Look you know you want it
Girl don't act like you don't want it
Girl you want it just as bad as I do
But check this out
You gon be wishing that you been gave me your money
By the time I finish rumbling with you
While rhymes get loose let's take this shit to the room
And you just keep yourself excited til we get to the room
Cuz I've been rocked up since I met you

Don't stunt now take off your shoes

200,200,Inside Your Heaven,"[Verse 1]
I've been down
Now I'm blessed
I felt a revelation comin' around
I guess it's right, it's so amazing
Every time I see you, I'm alive
You're all I've got
You lift me up
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes

[Chorus]
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in, a soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven

[Verse 2]
When we touch
When we love
The stars light up, the wrong becomes undone
Naturally, my soul surrenders
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes

[Chorus]
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in, a soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven

[Verse 3]
When minutes turn to days and years
If mountains fall, I'll still be here
Holding you until the day I die
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows you away

[Chorus]
I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from (Wanna be inside)
Where the storm blows your way
And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathin' in, a soothin' wind

Slick got more game than a little bit
Baby girl 5' 5"", brown eyes with them thick lips
Thick thighs with the slim hips
Sugar honey, ice tea
Baby girl is so sweet
And a bag of chips
I like to catch her when she coming home
Like side with a cherry thong
Eat her up like a sundae cone
But as of morning you got me open
Your tongue is stroking no joking
Coochie swollen, the bedroom smoking
Get some air up in this room girl
If loving you is wrong, I don't wanna be right
So I'mma take my time and do it right
Caz we got all night ..... caz we got all night, baby girl just

Baby, you don't pay me no mind
You act like you don't love me no more
Maybe you need space or some time
Your attitude is unpredictable
And I don't want to make you unhappy
If you're not happy
Then you're free to go on
Cause I don't want you staying around
If I make you so miserable

[Chorus]
If you don't want me, then don't talk to me
(If you don't want me, then don't talk to me)
Go ahead and free yourself

(Baby, don't you know I tried)
But the love I had inside has died
(But the love I had inside)

[Verse 2]
Won't you be a man if it's over
And just admit that things ain't the same
Instead of making me think it's all good between us
Which one's the blame
I took a lot of too much to handle
Until I can't take this game no more
This love thing is full of scandal
So you're welcome to walk

[Chorus]
If you don't want me, then don't talk to me

Time and time again I tried it over and over and over and over
But the love I had inside has died
(Baby, don't you...)

I had to take it there
I had to take it there
Because I'm tired, oh yeah

Hear that, how the veteran glide the record
But don't download, go out and buy the record
(Heeeeeeeeeeeeey)
Something sexy bout a
Girl on the floor, all her friends around her
I mean real clean, ain't gotta touch or nothing
It ain't like I like a chick on chick or something
I'm just a sucker for a hot track
Gimme a drink and a chick to tell 'Stop that'
Dance is a hop and a clap, flip it round
Now bring it on back, break it down

I gotta question, I need to ask somebody
Why is it that when y'all see me at the party
Y'all be looking like 'Ooo he's a movie star
He ain't supposed to be out on the floor with everybody'
But oh wait, whoa y'all forgetting
When I was, amateur spitting before the scripts were written
First one in, last one out the club
Bursting in, passing out in the club
Back at it, this cat is the wit and the charm
Taking you higher like a syringe hittin ya arm
Bringing the fire, making you Benz ring the alarm
Let me see you clap, spin baby come on
Switch!

Oh you just gonna stand there huh?
What you too cute to dance? Or you scared?
It ain't really that hard to do and
I ain't trying to be in love with you and
All I wanted was a moment or two to
See if you could do that Switch-a-roo and
Shut your mouth fool, get your crew and
The thick body and the rear one too and

See if y'all can do that Switch-a-roo

2 AM and she calls me 'cause I'm still awake
""Can you help me unravel my latest mistake?
I don't love him, winter just wasn't my season""
Yeah, we walk through the doors, so accusing their eyes
Like they have any right at all to criticize
Hypocrites, you're all here for the very same reason

[Chorus]
'Cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button, girl
So cradle your head in your hands
And breathe, just breathe
Oh, breathe, just breathe

[Verse 2]
May he turn 21 on the base at Fort Bliss
Just today he sat down to the flask in his fist
""Ain't been sober since maybe October of last year""
Here in town, you can tell he's been down for a while
But my god, it's so beautiful when the boy smiles
Wanna hold him, maybe, I'll just sing about it

[Chorus]
'Cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button, boys
So cradle your head in your hands
And breathe, just breathe
Oh, breathe, just breathe

[Bridge]
There's a light at each end of this tunnel
You shout 'cause you're just as far in as you'll ever be out
And these mistakes you made, you'll just make them again
If you'd only try turning around

[Breakdown]
2 AM and I'm still awake, writing a song
If I get it all down on paper, it's no longer inside of me
Threatening the life it belongs to
And I feel like I'm naked in front of the crowd
'Cause these words are my diary screaming out loud
And I know that you'll use them, however you want to

[Chorus]
But you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button now
Sing it if you understand
And breathe, just breathe
Oh, breathe, just breathe

Oh, breathe, just breathe
Oh, breathe, just breathe

But one more lie could be the worst

209,209,Untitled (How Can This Happen To Me?),"The supreme function of statesmanship is to provide against preventable evils. In seeking to do so, it encounters obstacles which are deeply rooted in human nature.

One is that by the very order of things such evils are not demonstrable until they have occurred: at each stage in their onset there is room for doubt and for dispute whether they be real or imaginary. By the same token, they attract little attention in comparison with current troubles, which are both indisputable and pressing: whence the besetting temptation of all politics to concern itself with the immediate present at the expense of the future.

Above all, people are disposed to mistake predicting troubles for causing troubles and even for desiring troubles: ""If only,"" they love to think, ""if only people wouldn't talk about it, it probably wouldn't happen.""

Perhaps this habit goes back to the primitive belief that the word and the thing, the name and the object, are identical.

At all events, the discussion of future grave but, with effort now, avoidable evils is the most unpopular and at the same time the most necessary occupation for the politician. Those who knowingly shirk it deserve, and not infrequently receive, the curses of those who come after.

A week or two ago I fell into conversation with a constituent, a middle-aged, quite ordinary working man employed in one of our nationalised industries.

After a sentence or two about the weather, he suddenly said: ""If I had the money to go, I wouldn't stay in this country."" I made some deprecatory reply to the effect that even this government wouldn't last for ever; but he took no notice, and continued: ""I have three children, all of them been through grammar school and two of them married now, with family. I shan't be satisfied till I have seen them all settled overseas. In this country in 15 or 20 years' time the black man will have the whip hand over the white man.""

I can already hear the chorus of execration. How dare I say such a horrible thing? How dare I stir up trouble and inflame feelings by repeating such a conversation?

The answer is that I do not have the right not to do so. Here is a decent, ordinary fellow Englishman, who in broad daylight in my own town says to me, his Member of Parliament, that his country will not be worth living in for his children.

I simply do not have the right to shrug my shoulders and think about something else. What he is saying, thousands and hundreds of thousands are saying and thinking - not throughout Great Britain, perhaps, but in the areas that are already undergoing the total transformation to which there is no parallel in a thousand years of English history.

In 15 or 20 years, on present trends, there will be in this country three and a half million Commonwealth immigrants and their descendants. That is not my figure. That is the official figure given to parliament by the spokesman of the Registrar General's Office.

There is no comparable official figure for the year 2000, but it must be in the region of five to seven million, approximately one-tenth of the whole population, and approaching that of Greater London. Of course, it will not be evenly distributed from Margate to Aberystwyth and from Penzance to Aberdeen. Whole areas, towns and parts of towns across England will be occupied by sections of the immigrant and immigrant-descended population.

As time goes on, the proportion of this total who are immigrant descendants, those born in England, who arrived here by exactly the same route as the rest of us, will rapidly increase. Already by 1985 the native-born would constitute the majority. It is this fact which creates the extreme urgency of action now, of just that kind of action which is hardest for politicians to take, action where the difficulties lie in the present but the evils to be prevented or minimised lie several parliaments ahead.

The natural and rational first question with a nation confronted by such a prospect is to ask: ""How can its dimensions be reduced?"" Granted it be not wholly preventable, can it be limited, bearing in mind that numbers are of the essence: the significance and consequences of an alien element introduced into a country or population are profoundly different according to whether that element is 1 per cent or 10 per cent.

The answers to the simple and rational question are equally simple and rational: by stopping, or virtually stopping, further inflow, and by promoting the maximum outflow. Both answers are part of the official policy of the Conservative Party.

It almost passes belief that at this moment 20 or 30 additional immigrant children are arriving from overseas in Wolverhampton alone every week - and that means 15 or 20 additional families a decade or two hence. Those whom the gods wish to destroy, they first make mad. We must be mad, literally mad, as a nation to be permitting the annual inflow of some 50,000 dependants, who are for the most part the material of the future growth of the immigrant-descended population. It is like watching a nation busily engaged in heaping up its own funeral pyre. So insane are we that we actually permit unmarried persons to immigrate for the purpose of founding a family with spouses and fiancés whom they have never seen.

Let no one suppose that the flow of dependants will automatically tail off. On the contrary, even at the present admission rate of only 5,000 a year by voucher, there is sufficient for a further 25,000 dependants per annum ad infinitum, without taking into account the huge reservoir of existing relations in this country - and I am making no allowance at all for fraudulent entry. In these circumstances nothing will suffice but that the total inflow for settlement should be reduced at once to negligible proportions, and that the necessary legislative and administrative measures be taken without delay.

I stress the words ""for settlement."" This has nothing to do with the entry of Commonwealth citizens, any more than of aliens, into this country, for the purposes of study or of improving their qualifications, like (for instance) the Commonwealth doctors who, to the advantage of their own countries, have enabled our hospital service to be expanded faster than would otherwise have been possible. They are not, and never have been, immigrants.

I turn to re-emigration. If all immigration ended tomorrow, the rate of growth of the immigrant and immigrant-descended population would be substantially reduced, but the prospective size of this element in the population would still leave the basic character of the national danger unaffected. This can only be tackled while a considerable proportion of the total still comprises persons who entered this country during the last ten years or so.

Hence the urgency of implementing now the second element of the Conservative Party's policy: the encouragement of re-emigration.

Nobody can make an estimate of the numbers which, with generous assistance, would choose either to return to their countries of origin or to go to other countries anxious to receive the manpower and the skills they represent.

Nobody knows, because no such policy has yet been attempted. I can only say that, even at present, immigrants in my own constituency from time to time come to me, asking if I can find them assistance to return home. If such a policy were adopted and pursued with the determination which the gravity of the alternative justifies, the resultant outflow could appreciably alter the prospects.

The third element of the Conservative Party's policy is that all who are in this country as citizens should be equal before the law and that there shall be no discrimination or difference made between them by public authority. As Mr Heath has put it we will have no ""first-class citizens"" and ""second-class citizens."" This does not mean that the immigrant and his descendent should be elevated into a privileged or special class or that the citizen should be denied his right to discriminate in the management of his own affairs between one fellow-citizen and another or that he should be subjected to imposition as to his reasons and motive for behaving in one lawful manner rather than another.

There could be no grosser misconception of the realities than is entertained by those who vociferously demand legislation as they call it ""against discrimination"", whether they be leader-writers of the same kidney and sometimes on the same newspapers which year after year in the 1930s tried to blind this country to the rising peril which confronted it, or archbishops who live in palaces, faring delicately with the bedclothes pulled right up over their heads. They have got it exactly and diametrically wrong.

The discrimination and the deprivation, the sense of alarm and of resentment, lies not with the immigrant population but with those among whom they have come and are still coming.

This is why to enact legislation of the kind before parliament at this moment is to risk throwing a match on to gunpowder. The kindest thing that can be said about those who propose and support it is that they know not what they do.

Nothing is more misleading than comparison between the Commonwealth immigrant in Britain and the American Negro. The Negro population of the United States, which was already in existence before the United States became a nation, started literally as slaves and were later given the franchise and other rights of citizenship, to the exercise of which they have only gradually and still incompletely come. The Commonwealth immigrant came to Britain as a full citizen, to a country which knew no discrimination between one citizen and another, and he entered instantly into the possession of the rights of every citizen, from the vote to free treatment under the National Health Service.

Whatever drawbacks attended the immigrants arose not from the law or from public policy or from administration, but from those personal circumstances and accidents which cause, and always will cause, the fortunes and experience of one man to be different from another's.

But while, to the immigrant, entry to this country was admission to privileges and opportunities eagerly sought, the impact upon the existing population was very different. For reasons which they could not comprehend, and in pursuance of a decision by default, on which they were never consulted, they found themselves made strangers in their own country.

They found their wives unable to obtain hospital beds in childbirth, their children unable to obtain school places, their homes and neighbourhoods changed beyond recognition, their plans and prospects for the future defeated; at work they found that employers hesitated to apply to the immigrant worker the standards of discipline and competence required of the native-born worker; they began to hear, as time went by, more and more voices which told them that they were now the unwanted. They now learn that a one-way privilege is to be established by act of parliament; a law which cannot, and is not intended to, operate to protect them or redress their grievances is to be enacted to give the stranger, the disgruntled and the agent-provocateur the power to pillory them for their private actions.

In the hundreds upon hundreds of letters I received when I last spoke on this subject two or three months ago, there was one striking feature which was largely new and which I find ominous. All Members of Parliament are used to the typical anonymous correspondent; but what surprised and alarmed me was the high proportion of ordinary, decent, sensible people, writing a rational and often well-educated letter, who believed that they had to omit their address because it was dangerous to have committed themselves to paper to a Member of Parliament agreeing with the views I had expressed, and that they would risk penalties or reprisals if they were known to have done so. The sense of being a persecuted minority which is growing among ordinary English people in the areas of the country which are affected is something that those without direct experience can hardly imagine.

I am going to allow just one of those hundreds of people to speak for me:

“Eight years ago in a respectable street in Wolverhampton a house was sold to a Negro. Now only one white (a woman old-age pensioner) lives there. This is her story. She lost her husband and both her sons in the war. So she turned her seven-roomed house, her only asset, into a boarding house. She worked hard and did well, paid off her mortgage and began to put something by for her old age. Then the immigrants moved in. With growing fear, she saw one house after another taken over. The quiet street became a place of noise and confusion. Regretfully, her white tenants moved out.

“The day after the last one left, she was awakened at 7am by two Negroes who wanted to use her 'phone to contact their employer. When she refused, as she would have refused any stranger at such an hour, she was abused and feared she would have been attacked but for the chain on her door. Immigrant families have tried to rent rooms in her house, but she always refused. Her little store of money went, and after paying rates, she has less than £2 per week. “She went to apply for a rate reduction and was seen by a young girl, who on hearing she had a seven-roomed house, suggested she should let part of it. When she said the only people she could get were Negroes, the girl said, ""Racial prejudice won't get you anywhere in this country."" So she went home.

“The telephone is her lifeline. Her family pay the bill, and help her out as best they can. Immigrants have offered to buy her house - at a price which the prospective landlord would be able to recover from his tenants in weeks, or at most a few months. She is becoming afraid to go out. Windows are broken. She finds excreta pushed through her letter box. When she goes to the shops, she is followed by children, charming, wide-grinning piccaninnies. They cannot speak English, but one word they know. ""Racialist,"" they chant. When the new Race Relations Bill is passed, this woman is convinced she will go to prison. And is she so wrong? I begin to wonder.”

The other dangerous delusion from which those who are wilfully or otherwise blind to realities suffer, is summed up in the word ""integration."" To be integrated into a population means to become for all practical purposes indistinguishable from its other members.

Now, at all times, where there are marked physical differences, especially of colour, integration is difficult though, over a period, not impossible. There are among the Commonwealth immigrants who have come to live here in the last fifteen years or so, many thousands whose wish and purpose is to be integrated and whose every thought and endeavour is bent in that direction.

But to imagine that such a thing enters the heads of a great and growing majority of immigrants and their descendants is a ludicrous misconception, and a dangerous one.

We are on the verge here of a change. Hitherto it has been force of circumstance and of background which has rendered the very idea of integration inaccessible to the greater part of the immigrant population - that they never conceived or intended such a thing, and that their numbers and physical concentration meant the pressures towards integration which normally bear upon any small minority did not operate.

Now we are seeing the growth of positive forces acting against integration, of vested interests in the preservation and sharpening of racial and religious differences, with a view to the exercise of actual domination, first over fellow-immigrants and then over the rest of the population. The cloud no bigger than a man's hand, that can so rapidly overcast the sky, has been visible recently in Wolverhampton and has shown signs of spreading quickly. The words I am about to use, verbatim as they appeared in the local press on 17 February, are not mine, but those of a Labour Member of Parliament who is a minister in the present government:

'The Sikh communities' campaign to maintain customs inappropriate in Britain is much to be regretted. Working in Britain, particularly in the public services, they should be prepared to accept the terms and conditions of their employment. To claim special communal rights (or should one say rites?) leads to a dangerous fragmentation within society. This communalism is a canker; whether practised by one colour or another it is to be strongly condemned.'

All credit to John Stonehouse for having had the insight to perceive that, and the courage to say it.

For these dangerous and divisive elements the legislation proposed in the Race Relations Bill is the very pabulum they need to flourish. Here is the means of showing that the immigrant communities can organise to consolidate their members, to agitate and campaign against their fellow citizens, and to overawe and dominate the rest with the legal weapons which the ignorant and the ill-informed have provided. As I look ahead, I am filled with foreboding; like the Roman, I seem to see ""the River Tiber foaming with much blood.""

That tragic and intractable phenomenon which we watch with horror on the other side of the Atlantic but which there is interwoven with the history and existence of the States itself, is coming upon us here by our own volition and our own neglect. Indeed, it has all but come. In numerical terms, it will be of American proportions long before the end of the century.

Only resolute and urgent action will avert it even now. Whether there will be the public will to demand and obtain that action, I do not know. All I know is that to see, and not to speak, would be the great betrayal.",[],0,Enoch Powell,Simple Plan,2005,"[80, 75, 67, 65, 56, 56, 49, 50, 53, 55, 57, 57, 53, 63, 73, 95]",16,Untitled (How Can This Happen to Me?),https://open.spotify.com/track/3oo3XvEmZFGFAgwMUamZyf,3oo3XvEmZFGFAgwMUamZyf,spotify:track:3oo3XvEmZFGFAgwMUamZyf,The Karaoke Channel - Sing Untitled (How Can This Happen to Me?)

210,210,Don't Worry 'Bout A Thing,"Ever been misunderstood, misused, or misled
Ever knocked on the sky
And had it fall on your head
Well, don't worry 'bout it, don't worry
Ever lost your luggage, your marbles
Your house
Or found yourself in bed with Uncle Sam or Mickey Mouse
Ever been accused of murder on Music Row
Or caught in morning traffic when you
Really gotta go - Oh no!

(Chorus)
Life is funny, life's a mess
Sometimes a curse, sometimes a blessing
Don't worry 'bout a thing, don't worry 'bout it
Life gets sticky, life can bruise
Sometimes you win sometimes you're losing
No matter what it brings
Don't worry 'bout a thing

Ever sat yourself down when the
Seat is all wet
Or see your ""ex"" sucking face with
A little brunette
Don't worry 'bout it, no don't worry
Ever lost your religion, ever lost your
Best friend
Or found your last record in the bargain bin
Or been stuck in a divorce like crazy glue
Or scraped someone else's gum off the
Bottom of your shoe - Boo hoo!

(Repeat Chorus)
(Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah - Blah, Blah
Blah, Blah, Blah, - Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah
Blah)

Don't worry, don't worry

(Bridge:)
We all got a little junk in the trunk
And when you're feelin' good as sunk
Remember, everything will be just fine
If I laugh at yours then you'll laugh at mine

(Repeat Chorus 2x)

Blah, Blah, Blah, - Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah

[Verse 1: The Game & (Sample)]
I woke up out that coma 2001
'Bout the same time Dre dropped 2001
Three years later the album is done
Aftermath presents: Nigga Witta Attitude, Volume One
Rap critics politickin', wanna know the outcome
Ready to Die, Reasonable Doubt, and Doggystyle in one
I feel like 'Pac after the Snoop Dogg trial was done
Dre behind that G series and All Eyez on Me
I watched the death of a dynasty, so I told Vibe Magazine
Workin' with Dr. Dre was a (""Dream"")
I had visions of makin a classic, then my world turned black
Like I was starin' out of Stevie Wonder's glasses
It's kinda hard to imagine, like Kanye West
Coming back from his fatal accident to beatmakin' and rappin'
But, we the future, Whitney Houston told me that
It's gon' take more than a bullet in the heart to hold me back

[Chorus: The Game & (Sample)]
Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
'Cause Martin Luther King had a (""Dream"")
Aaliyah had a (""Dream""), Left Eye had a (""Dream"")
So I reached out to Kanye and (""I brought you all my dreams 'cause I love you"")
(""I—love you""
""I—love you""
""I-I-I love you"")

[Verse 2: The Game]
I had dreams of fuckin' a R&B bitch like Mya
When I saw that ass on the front of that King
Read the article in the magazine, she loved gangsters, loved nasty things
So I'm in the glass house having nasty dreams
Good girls never give it up
But anything is possible, if 50 fucked Vivica
Hurdled life's obstacles, found my way through the maze
Then joy turned to pain like Frankie Beverly and Maze
Used to dream of being Unsigned Hype
'Til I was crushed by Dave Mays, almost let my pen fall asleep on the page
Daydreamin' yesterday, dozin' off backstage
I thought I saw Eazy talking to Jam Master Jay
So I walked over, heard Jam Master say
""It's a hard knock life, then you pass away""
They say sleep is the cousin of death, so my eyes wide open
'Cause a dream is kin to your last breath

[Chorus: The Game & (Sample)]
Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
'Cause Martin Luther King had a (""Dream"")
Aaliyah had a (""Dream""), Left Eye had a (""Dream"")
So I reached out to Kanye and (""I brought you all my dreams 'cause I love you"")
(""I—love you""
""I—love you""
""I-I-I love you"")

[Verse 3: The Game]
The dream of Huey Newton, that's what I'm livin' through
The dream of Eric Wright, that's what I'm givin' you
Who walked through the White House without a business suit
Compton hat, jheri curl drippin' on Ronald Reagan's shoes
Gave Mike Lem my demo, came here to pay my dues
Started off with Whoo Kid, then I start blazin' Clue
It was all a dream like Big said it'd be
Don't sleep on me homey, I bring nightmares to reality
Rap phenomenon, defyin' the rules of gravity
Studied all the classics, start revisin' my strategy
'Cause Marshall Mathers made it, Curtis Jackson made it
Head in the clouds, wonderin' where the hell Marvin Gaye went
How do I say this? I'm livin' for my son
But I can't figure out, why I'm at my temple with this gun
Wake up to a Jesus piece, like a catholic nun
The war to be a rap legend has just begun

[Chorus: The Game & (Sample)]
Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a (""Dream"")
Aaliyah had a (""Dream""), Left Eye had a (""Dream"")
So I reached out to Kanye and (""I brought you all my dreams 'cause I love you"")
(""I—love you""

[R. Kelly]
I hope y'all got y'all playa's cards
'Cause y'all ain't gettin' in unless you do

[The Game]
Bounce, it's the new 12-play
Bounce, throw the pussy like Elway
Bounce, I wanna see your tail shake
Bounce, when you hear R. Kellz say

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Playa's only
We where them chicks be jerkin' they bodies
Up in the club where they get real naughty
Take 'em from here to the private party
Where there ain't nothin' but
Playa's only
Where the playas be spendin' a lot of dough
Honeys got ass bouncin' on the floor
This is how we do behind the playa's door

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
(She on the floor) Surrounded by them playas and thugs
(She on the floor) The girls goin' wild in the club
(In V.I.P.) Got 'dro with a bottle of bub
(She don't care) Shakin' ass, just throwin' 'em up
I'd really like to know her
The way she runs her
Body up and down, she got me heated up
I can't front, I really wanna beat it up
Show her how I hit the bar and spend it up
You ain't gotta be worried 'bout being alone
'Cause tonight we'll be together in my home
Exit out the club, bouncin' our domes
Got that red coupe matchin' the chrome
Put that body in motion, motion
And watch it wave like a ocean, ocean
Now break it down and worm it, worm it
Now bring it up, now shake it, shake it

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Playa's only
We where them chicks be jerkin' they bodies
Up in the club where they get real naughty
Take 'em from here to the private party
Where there ain't nothin' but
Playa's only
Where the playas be spendin' a lot of dough
Honeys got ass bouncin' on the floor
This is how we do behind the playa's door

[Verse 2: The Game]
I'm still fresh like, uhh, Impala, uhh
Dre's young gun still ridin' the bass drum
Four times platinum, Hate It Or Love It, I'm still number one
Still in the hood, one hand on my gun
And my trigger finger still make bitches come
I mean the one with the ring in the tongue
Compton, R. Kelly found her in the slumps
Shaking that rump, both hands on the pumps
Send her home with me, I have your girl yellin', uhh
Kellz, my bitch drunk
But her two girlfriends still wanna have fun
Pass the blunt, let her drink red rum
Bet she ain't never seen a penthouse at the Trump
Me and R. been around the world
And we'll give it to you just how you like it, girl

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
Girl, you're on a mission
Step into the club, shuttin' down competition
The way you walk it, talk it, switch it
And when the doors close, handle your business
Now make your booty go (Boom boom boom boom)
Break it down now (Boom boom boom boom boom)
Bring it up now (Boom boom boom boom)
Push it back, girl
(Kellz, you crazy for this one)
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Out the club, in the coupe to the mansion
We gon' get bent up 'til the morning
Laying back in the chair while you wind it
Lap dance on me girl, bump and grind it
We gon' do it 'til we drop, until the party stop
We gon' keep it hot, oh

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Playa's only
We where them chicks be jerkin' they bodies
Up in the club where they get real naughty
Take 'em from here to the private party
Where there ain't nothin' but
Playa's only
Where the playas be spendin' a lot of dough
Honeys got ass bouncin' on the floor
This is how we do behind the playa's door

[Bridge: R. Kelly]
I like it when you flip that, bump that, roll that
Shake that, drop that, grope that
Make it go clap-clap
Flip that, bump that, roll that, shake that
Drop that, grope that
Make it go clap-clap

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Playa's only
We where them chicks be jerkin' they bodies
Up in the club where they get real naughty
Take 'em from here to the private party
Where there ain't nothin' but
Playa's only
Where the playas be spendin' a lot of dough

I think about the day I met the perfect stranger, I think about us
And I think about the day i got wrapped around your fingers, I think about us
The sun was shinin' on you
The lord was smilin' on me
And love was callin' us
I had my mind made up

[Chorus 1]
And I can't stop lovin' you
I can't help myself
And I can't get over you
No matter what I tell myself, baby

[Verse 2]
Never thought I'd ever love any one else in my weakness, I think about us
And I think about the day you left without speakin', I think about us
I think about the love we had for our children, I think about us
I think about the way we laughed without a reason, I think about us, girl
There will be no more lies
Somebody tell me why I feel like I'm dyin'
Lord what's come over me
Ooh baby, can't you see

[Chorus 2]
That I can't stop lovin' you
I can't help myself
And I can't get over you
No matter what I tell myself baby
Yea, yea
I can't stop lovin' you (stop lovin' you girl)
No matter how hard I try
And I can't get over you, babe
And I don't know why

218,218,Wordplay,"[Verse 1]
I've been all around the world, I've been a new sensation
But it doesn't really matter in this generation
The sophomore slump is an uphill battle
And someone said that ain't my scene
'Cause they need a new song like a new religion
Music for the television
I can't do the long division
Someone do the math
For the record label puts me on the shelf up in the freezer
Gotta find another way to live the life of leisure
So I drop my top
Mix and I mingle
Is everybody ready for the single? And it goes...

[Chorus]
Ha la la la la la
Now listen closer to the verse I lay
(Ha la la la la la)
It's all about the wordplay
Ha la la la, love
The wonderful thing it does
Because, because
I am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's
Yeah, the Mister A to Z
They say I'm all about the wordplay

[Verse 2]
When it's time to get ill, I got your remedy
For those who don't remember me
Well, let me introduce you to my style
I try to keep a jumble and the lyrics never mumble
When the music's makin'' people tongue-tied
You want a new song like a new religion, music for the television
I can't do the long division, someone do the math
For the people write me off like I'm a one-hit wonder
Gotta find another way to keep from going' under
Pull out the stops
Got your attention
I guess it's time again for me to mention the wordplay

[Chorus]
Ha la la la la la
Now listen closer to the verse I lay
(Ha la la la la la)
It's all about the wordplay
Ha la la la, love
The wonderful thing it does
Because, because
I am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's
Yeah, the Mister A to Z
They say I'm all about the wordplay

[Verse 3]
I built a bridge across the stream my consciousness
It always seems to be a flowin'
But I don't know which way my brain is going
Oh, the rhyming and the timing keeps the melodies inside me
And they're coming till I'm running out of air
Are you prepared to take a dive into the deep end of my head?
Are you listening to a single word I've said?

[Chorus]
Ha la la la la la
Now listen closer to the verse I lay
(Ha la la la la la)
I'm stickin' to the wordplay
Ha la la la, love
The wonderful thing it does
Because, because
I am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's
Yeah, the Mister A to Z
They say I'm all about the wordplay
Ha la la la la la
Now listen closer to the verse I lay

You're keeping in step
In the line
Got your chin held high and you feel just fine
Cause you do
What you're told
But inside your heart it is black and it's hollow and it's cold

[Chorus]
Just how deep do you believe?
Will you bite the hand that feeds?
Will you chew until it bleeds?
Can you get up off your knees?
Are you brave enough to see?
Do you want to change it?

[Verse 2]
What if this whole crusade's
A charade
And behind it all there's a price to be paid
For the blood
Which we dine
Justified in the name of the holy and the divine

[Chorus]
Just how deep do you believe?
Will you bite the hand that feeds?
Will you chew until it bleeds?
Can you get up off your knees?
Are you brave enough to see?
Do you wanna change it?

I keep holding on to what I want to believe
I can see
But I keep holding on and on and on and on

I’ve given up on giving up slowly
I’m blending in so you won’t even know me
Apart from this whole world that shares my fate
This one last bullet you mention
Is my one last shot at redemption
'Cause I know to live, you must give your life away

[Pre-Chorus]
And I’ve been housing all this doubt and insecurity
And I’ve been locked inside that house
All the while you hold the key
And I’ve been dying to get out and that might be the death of me
And even though there’s no way of knowing where to go
I promise I’m going because

[Chorus]
I gotta get outta here
I'm stuck inside this rut that I fell into by mistake
I gotta get outta here
And I'm begging you, I'm begging you
I’m begging you to be my escape

[Verse 2]
I'm giving up on doing this alone now
'Cause I've failed and I’m ready to be shown how
You've told me the way and I'm trying to get there
And this life sentence that I'm serving
I admit that I'm every bit deserving
But the beauty of grace is that it makes life not fair

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I've been housing all this doubt and insecurity
And I've been locked inside that house, all the while you hold the key
And I've been dying to get out and that might be the death of me

Promise I'm going because

'Cause I'm afraid that this complacency is something I can't shake, yeah
I gotta get outta here
And I'm begging you, I'm begging you
I'm begging you to be my escape

[Bridge]
I am a hostage to my own humanity
Self-detained and forced to live in this mess I've made
And all I'm asking is for you to do what you can with me
But I can't ask you to give what you already gave

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I've been housing all this doubt and insecurity
And I’ve been locked inside that house, all the while you hold the key
And I've been dying to get out, that might be the death of me
And even though there’s no way of knowing where to go
I promise I’m going because

[Chorus]
I gotta get outta here
I'm stuck inside this rut that I fell into by mistake
I gotta get outta here
And I'm begging you, I'm begging you
I’m begging you to be my escape

[Outro]
I fought you for so long, I should have let you win
Oh, how we regret those things we do
And all I was trying to do was save my own skin (oh)
But so were you, so were you","['i’ve', 'give', 'up', 'on', 'give', 'up', 'slowly', 'i’m', 'blend', 'in', 'so', 'you', 'won’t', 'even', 'know', 'me', 'apart', 'from', 'this', 'whole', 'world', 'that', 'share', 'my', 'fate', 'this', 'one', 'last', 'bullet', 'you', 'mention', 'be', 'my', 'one', 'last', 'shoot', 'at', 'redemption', 'cause', 'i', 'know', 'to', 'live', 'you', 'must', 'give', 'your', 'life', 'away', 'and', 'i’ve', 'be', 'house', 'all', 'this', 'doubt', 'and', 'insecurity', 'and', 'i’ve', 'be', 'lock', 'inside', 'that', 'house', 'all', 'the', 'while', 'you', 'hold', 'the', 'key', 'and', 'i’ve', 'be', 'die', 'to', 'get', 'out', 'and', 'that', 'might', 'be', 'the', 'death', 'of', 'me', 'and', 'even', 'though', 'there’s', 'no', 'way', 'of', 'know', 'where', 'to', 'go', 'i', 'promise', 'i’m', 'go', 'because', 'i', 'gotta', 'get', 'outta', 'here', 'im', 'stick', 'inside', 'this', 'rut', 'that', 'i', 'fell', 'into', 'by', 'mistake', 'i', 'gotta', 'get', 'outta', 'here', 'and', 'im', 'beg', 'you', 'im', 'beg', 'you', 'i’m', 'beg', 'you', 'to', 'be', 'my', 'escape', 'im', 'give', 'up', 'on', 'do', 'this', 'alone', 'now', 'cause', 'ive', 'fail', 'and', 'i’m', 'ready', 'to', 'be', 'show', 'how', 'youve', 'tell', 'me', 'the', 'way', 'and', 'im', 'try', 'to', 'get', 'there', 'and', 'this', 'life', 'sentence', 'that', 'im', 'serve', 'i', 'admit', 'that', 'im', 'every', 'bite', 'deserve', 'but', 'the', 'beauty', 'of', 'grace', 'be', 'that', 'it', 'make', 'life', 'not', 'fair', 'cause', 'ive', 'be', 'house', 'all', 'this', 'doubt', 'and', 'insecurity', 'and', 'ive', 'be', 'lock', 'inside', 'that', 'house', 'all', 'the', 'while', 'you', 'hold', 'the', 'key', 'and', 'ive', 'be', 'die', 'to', 'get', 'out', 'and', 'that', 'might', 'be', 'the', 'death', 'of', 'me', 'and', 'even', 'though', 'theres', 'no', 'way', 'of', 'know', 'where', 'to', 'go', 'promise', 'im', 'go', 'because', 'i', 'gotta', 'get', 'outta', 'here', 'cause', 'im', 'afraid', 'that', 'this', 'complacency', 'be', 'something', 'i', 'cant', 'shake', 'yeah', 'i', 'gotta', 'get', 'outta', 'here', 'and', 'im', 'beg', 'you', 'im', 'beg', 'you', 'im', 'beg', 'you', 'to', 'be', 'my', 'escape', 'i', 'be', 'a', 'hostage', 'to', 'my', 'own', 'humanity', 'selfdetained', 'and', 'force', 'to', 'live', 'in', 'this', 'mess', 'ive', 'make', 'and', 'all', 'im', 'ask', 'be', 'for', 'you', 'to', 'do', 'what', 'you', 'can', 'with', 'me', 'but', 'i', 'cant', 'ask', 'you', 'to', 'give', 'what', 'you', 'already', 'give', 'cause', 'ive', 'be', 'house', 'all', 'this', 'doubt', 'and', 'insecurity', 'and', 'i’ve', 'be', 'lock', 'inside', 'that', 'house', 'all', 'the', 'while', 'you', 'hold', 'the', 'key', 'and', 'ive', 'be', 'die', 'to', 'get', 'out', 'that', 'might', 'be', 'the', 'death', 'of', 'me', 'and', 'even', 'though', 'there’s', 'no', 'way', 'of', 'know', 'where', 'to', 'go', 'i', 'promise', 'i’m', 'go', 'because', 'i', 'gotta', 'get', 'outta', 'here', 'im', 'stick', 'inside', 'this', 'rut', 'that', 'i', 'fell', 'into', 'by', 'mistake', 'i', 'gotta', 'get', 'outta', 'here', 'and', 'im', 'beg', 'you', 'im', 'beg', 'you', 'i’m', 'beg', 'you', 'to', 'be', 'my', 'escape', 'i', 'fight', 'you', 'for', 'so', 'long', 'i', 'should', 'have', 'let', 'you', 'win', 'oh', 'how', 'we', 'regret', 'those', 'things', 'we', 'do', 'but', 'so', 'be', 'you', 'so', 'be', 'you']",440,Relient K,Relient K,2005,"[88, 87, 82, 88]",4,Be My Escape,https://open.spotify.com/track/3Vi93V7o1tT28Cut4gSWi3,3Vi93V7o1tT28Cut4gSWi3,spotify:track:3Vi93V7o1tT28Cut4gSWi3,Mmhmm,3cJE7FR4nYlCE00wqqRcQi,spotify:album:3cJE7FR4nYlCE00wqqRcQi,Relient K,3nJWBJvK7uGvfp4iZh9CkN,spotify:artist:3nJWBJvK7uGvfp4iZh9CkN,240.453,14.0,62.0,2004-11-02,0.5539999999999999,0.8640000000000001,9.0,-5.062,1.0,0.0394,0.00605,0.0,0.132,0.299,112.523,"['canadian ccm', 'christian alternative rock', 'christian music', 'christian punk', 'christian rock', 'neo mellow', 'pop punk', 'pop rock']",[],1.0
221,221,Trapped In The Closet,"[Verse]
Seven o'clock in the morning
And the rays from the sun wakes me
I'm stretching and yawning
In a bed that don't belong to me
And a voice yells, ""Good morning, darling"" from the bathroom
Then she comes out and kisses me
And to my surprise she ain't you
Now I've got this dumb look on my face like what have I done?
How could I be so stupid to be have laid here 'til the morning sun?
Must have lost the track of time
Oh, what was on my mind?
From the club, went to her home
Didn't plan to stay that long
Here I am, quickly tryin' to put on my clothes
Searching for my car keys
Tryin' to get on up out the door
Then she stretched her hands in front of it
Said, ""You can't go this way""
Looked at her, like she was crazy
Said, ""Woman, move out my way""
Said, ""I got a wife at home""
She said, ""Please don't go out there""
""Lady, I've got to get home""
She said, her husband was comin' up the stairs
""Shh, shh, quiet, hurry up and get in the closet""
She said, ""Don't you make a sound, or some shit is going down""
I said, ""Why don't I just go out the window?""
""Yes, except for one thing, we on the fifth floor""
""Shit, think, shit, think, shit, quick, put me in the closet""
And now I'm in this darkest closet, tryin' to figure out
Just how I'm gonna get my crazy ass up out this house
And he walks in and yells, ""I'm home""
She says ""Honey I'm in the room""
He walks in there with a smile on his face
Sayin', ""Honey, I've been missin' you""
She hops all over him and says ""I've cooked and ran your bathwater""
I'm telling you now, this girl's so good that she deserves an Oscar
Throws her in the bed and starts to snatching her clothes off
I'm in the closet, like man, what the fuck is going on?
You're not gonna believe it, but things get deeper as the story goes on
Next thing you know, a call comes through on my cell phone
I tried my best to quickly put it on vibrate
But from the way he act, I could tell it was too late
He hopped up and said, ""There’s a mystery going on
And I'm going to solve it""
And I'm like, ""God please, don't let this man open this closet""
He walks in the bathroom
And looks behind the door
She says, ""Baby, come back to bed""
He says, ""Bitch, say no more""
He pulls back the shower curtain
While she's biting her nails
Then he walks back to the room
Right now, I'm sweating like hell
Checks under the bed (bed)
Then under the dresser (dresser)
He looks at the closet (closet)
I pull out my Beretta (Beretta)
He walks up to the closet (closet)
Get closer to the closet (closet)
Now he's at the closet (closet)
Now he’s opening the closet (closet, closet, closet...)","['seven', 'oclock', 'in', 'the', 'morning', 'and', 'the', 'ray', 'from', 'the', 'sun', 'wake', 'me', 'im', 'stretch', 'and', 'yawn', 'in', 'a', 'bed', 'that', 'dont', 'belong', 'to', 'me', 'and', 'a', 'voice', 'yell', 'good', 'morning', 'darling', 'from', 'the', 'bathroom', 'then', 'she', 'come', 'out', 'and', 'kiss', 'me', 'and', 'to', 'my', 'surprise', 'she', 'aint', 'you', 'now', 'ive', 'get', 'this', 'dumb', 'look', 'on', 'my', 'face', 'like', 'what', 'have', 'i', 'do', 'how', 'could', 'i', 'be', 'so', 'stupid', 'to', 'be', 'have', 'lay', 'here', 'til', 'the', 'morning', 'sun', 'must', 'have', 'lose', 'the', 'track', 'of', 'time', 'oh', 'what', 'be', 'on', 'my', 'mind', 'from', 'the', 'club', 'go', 'to', 'her', 'home', 'didnt', 'plan', 'to', 'stay', 'that', 'long', 'here', 'i', 'be', 'quickly', 'tryin', 'to', 'put', 'on', 'my', 'clothe', 'search', 'for', 'my', 'car', 'key', 'tryin', 'to', 'get', 'on', 'up', 'out', 'the', 'door', 'then', 'she', 'stretch', 'her', 'hand', 'in', 'front', 'of', 'it', 'say', 'you', 'cant', 'go', 'this', 'way', 'look', 'at', 'her', 'like', 'she', 'be', 'crazy', 'say', 'woman', 'move', 'out', 'my', 'way', 'say', 'i', 'get', 'a', 'wife', 'at', 'home', 'she', 'say', 'please', 'dont', 'go', 'out', 'there', 'lady', 'ive', 'get', 'to', 'get', 'home', 'she', 'say', 'her', 'husband', 'be', 'comin', 'up', 'the', 'stairs', 'shh', 'shh', 'quiet', 'hurry', 'up', 'and', 'get', 'in', 'the', 'closet', 'she', 'say', 'dont', 'you', 'make', 'a', 'sound', 'or', 'some', 'shit', 'be', 'go', 'down', 'i', 'say', 'why', 'dont', 'i', 'just', 'go', 'out', 'the', 'window', 'yes', 'except', 'for', 'one', 'thing', 'we', 'on', 'the', 'fifth', 'floor', 'shit', 'think', 'shit', 'think', 'shit', 'quick', 'put', 'me', 'in', 'the', 'closet', 'and', 'now', 'im', 'in', 'this', 'darkest', 'closet', 'tryin', 'to', 'figure', 'out', 'just', 'how', 'im', 'gonna', 'get', 'my', 'crazy', 'ass', 'up', 'out', 'this', 'house', 'and', 'he', 'walk', 'in', 'and', 'yell', 'im', 'home', 'she', 'say', 'honey', 'im', 'in', 'the', 'room', 'he', 'walk', 'in', 'there', 'with', 'a', 'smile', 'on', 'his', 'face', 'sayin', 'honey', 'ive', 'be', 'missin', 'you', 'she', 'hop', 'all', 'over', 'him', 'and', 'say', 'ive', 'cook', 'and', 'run', 'your', 'bathwater', 'im', 'tell', 'you', 'now', 'this', 'girls', 'so', 'good', 'that', 'she', 'deserve', 'an', 'oscar', 'throw', 'her', 'in', 'the', 'bed', 'and', 'start', 'to', 'snatch', 'her', 'clothe', 'off', 'im', 'in', 'the', 'closet', 'like', 'man', 'what', 'the', 'fuck', 'be', 'go', 'on', 'youre', 'not', 'gonna', 'believe', 'it', 'but', 'things', 'get', 'deeper', 'as', 'the', 'story', 'go', 'on', 'next', 'thing', 'you', 'know', 'a', 'call', 'come', 'through', 'on', 'my', 'cell', 'phone', 'i', 'try', 'my', 'best', 'to', 'quickly', 'put', 'it', 'on', 'vibrate', 'but', 'from', 'the', 'way', 'he', 'act', 'i', 'could', 'tell', 'it', 'be', 'too', 'late', 'he', 'hop', 'up', 'and', 'say', 'there’s', 'a', 'mystery', 'go', 'on', 'and', 'im', 'go', 'to', 'solve', 'it', 'and', 'im', 'like', 'god', 'please', 'dont', 'let', 'this', 'man', 'open', 'this', 'closet', 'he', 'walk', 'in', 'the', 'bathroom', 'and', 'look', 'behind', 'the', 'door', 'she', 'say', 'baby', 'come', 'back', 'to', 'bed', 'he', 'say', 'bitch', 'say', 'no', 'more', 'he', 'pull', 'back', 'the', 'shower', 'curtain', 'while', 'shes', 'bite', 'her', 'nail', 'then', 'he', 'walk', 'back', 'to', 'the', 'room', 'right', 'now', 'im', 'sweat', 'like', 'hell']",466,R.

I saw her, yeah I saw her with her black tongue tied
Round the roses
Fist pounding on a vending machine
Toy diamond ring stuck on her finger
With a noose she can hang from the sun
And put it out with her dark sunglasses
Walking crooked down the beach
She spits on the sand where their bones are bleaching

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
She doesn't even know what's wrong
And I know I'm gonna make her die
Take her where her soul belongs
And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
Nothing that I wouldn't try

I saw her, yeah I saw her with her hands tied back
And her rags were burning
Crawling out from a land filled life
Hands tied back, her rags were burning
Hands tied back, her rags were burning
Throw a coin in a fountain of dust
White noise, her ears are ringing
White noise, her ears are ringing
Got a ticket for a midnight hanging
Throw a bullet from a freight train leaving

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know I'm gonna steal her eye
She doesn't even know what's wrong
And I know I'm gonna make her die
Take her where her soul belongs
And I know I'm gonna steal her eye

Hope is an anchor and love is a ship
Time is the ocean and life is a trip
You don't know where you're going
'Til you know where you're at
And if you can't read the stars
Well, you'd better have a map
A compass and a conscience
So you don't get lost at sea
Or on some old lonely island
Where no one wants to be

[Verse 2]
From the beginning of creation
I think our maker had a plan
For us to leave these shores
And sail beyond the sand
And let the good light guide us
To the waves and the wind
To the beaches in a world
Where we have never been
And we'll climb up on the mountain y'all
We'll let our voices ring
And those who've never tried it
They'll be the first to sing
Oh, my, my

[Chorus]
I'll see you on the other side if I make it
And it might be a long hard ride, but I'm gonna take it
Sometimes it seems that I don't have a prayer
Let the weather take me anywhere
But I know that I want to go
Where the streets are gold 'cause you'll be there
Oh, my, my

[Verse 3]
You don't bring nothin' with you here
And you can't take nothin' back
I ain't never seen a hearse with a luggage rack
So I've torn my knees a-prayin'
Scarred my back from falling down
Spent so much time flying high
'Til I'm face first in the ground
So if you're up there watching me
Would you talk to God and say
Tell him I might need a hand
To see you both someday
Oh, my, my

[Chorus]
So I'll see you on the other side if I make it
And it might be a long hard ride, but I'm gonna take it
Sometimes it seems that I don't have a prayer
Let the weather take me anywhere
But I know that I want to go
Where the streets are gold 'cause you'll be there
Oh, my, my

225,225,Go!,"Four in the morning and I'm sober walking through the rain
It doesn't matter where I'm going everywhere's the same
Cold dark room
I've put myself into

You were a window to a world that I could never know
And asked for every piece of me and so I let you go
Way too soon
Now I'm back to my cold dark room

If I could take it all back
I could make it all right
You could be the best part of my life
I can tell you all night that I wanna be
The man I'm supposed to be
That...

I won't lie
I've waited a million hours just to say that
I will die if you leave me
You are the way my heart beats
And you are the words my tongue speaks
And I will die if you leave me

I know you've heard a thousand words that took your breath away
A million melodies that never got the notes to say
What they mean
I promised you everything

If I could take it all back
I could make it all right
You could be the best part of my life
I can tell you all night that I wanna be
The man I'm supposed to be
That...

I won't lie
I've waited a million hours just to say that
I will die if you leave me
You are the way my heart beats
And you are the words my tongue speaks
And I will die if you leave me

This is me when my world stops turning
Heart stops while I notice everything is falling apart
This is me when my lungs start burning
To say what I mean when I know that I could but I won't
Tell me things that'll break the silence
I swear I can hear every heart beat in this place
I wanna see the hope, I wanna feel the love, I wanna hear what you say When I say

I won't lie
I've waited a million hours just to say that
I will die if you leave me
You are the way my heart beats
And you are the words my tongue speaks
And I will die if you leave me

Don't all the dreams we've seen come true mean anything
You say it's different now and you keep starin' at the door
How can you walk away, don't I matter anymore

If bein' free's worth what you leave behind
And if it's too late for love to change your mind
Then it's goodbye time

If we had known our love would come to this
We could have saved our hearts the hurt of wasted years
Well it's been fun, what else can I say
If the feeling's gone words won't stop you anyway

With the candy coated Tennessey

Because your kiss is my lips, girl, I'm ready to roll

We had a dog named Bocephus living in the front yard
He liked sleeping out on the top of the car
He drank beer out of the mason jar
And he'd climb up on everyone in bed
A white frame house, a college town
A bunch of people always hanging around
No real problems we needed to drown but we tried our best anyway
We went to class just to pass the time, back in eighty nine

[Chorus]
We had a, keg in the closet, pizza on the floor
Left over from the night before
Where we were going we didn't really care
We had all we ever wanted
In that keg in the closet

[Verse 2]
This old guitar taught me how to score, right there on the Lambda Chi porch
Mary Ann taught me a little more about wanting what you can't have
Sweatshirts and flag football, spring breaks down in Panama
For a while we had it all, we never dreamed it wouldn't last
We went to class just to pass the time back in eighty nine

[Chorus]
We had a, keg in the closet, pizza on the floor
Left over from the night before
Where we were going we didn't really care
We had all we ever wanted
In that keg in the closet

They ain't covered yet
There's at least another million miles
Under these old bus treads
So if you think I'm going to settle down
I've got news for you

Ain't for the faint of heart
So you won't fall for me
If you know what's good for you

Cause I still got a lot of leaving left to do

I guess the Lord made me hard to handle
So loving me might be a long shot gamble
So before you go and turn me on
Be sure that you can turn me loose

Cause I still got a lot of leaving left to do

Girl, you look like you might be an angel
So I won't lie
I could love you like the devil
If you wanted me to tonight
And we could talk about forever for a day or two

I'm on my grind, Grand Hustle
Got the mind and the muscle
50 carats in the crown just to shine on you suckas
I still tote the Glock 40 for the haters and the bustas
Fuck probation, if a nigga try to play me I'mma bust him
Ion't need no security, reaching for my jewelry
Get you niggas popped quick, filled full of hot shit
Fresh out the box Tip hopped in a drop 6
Made a quarter mil' in the pen givin' stock tips
Haters wanna stop Tip, mad 'cus they not Tip
Ball every summer so your baby mama jock Tip
You don't no drama pimp, I promise I do not slip
Chrome 4-5th, hid well if the cops trip
Bought my girl a Hummer with the chrome right in front of dat
5 carat stones with the platinum all up under dat
Rap beef I ain't gonna participate in none of dat
I'm aimin' at your fitted cap and you ain't gonna want none of dat

[Hook]
(Asap asap asap...)
A nigga try to play me, I'mma blow him off the map A-S-A-P
Ask anbody who runnin' a G, bet they finna say me A-S-A-P
Niggas hatin' on P.S.C. get straightened A-S-A-P
A nigga try to play me, I'mma blow him off the map A-S-A-P

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I know a lot of rappers don't like me, but they won't fight me
Feds swear I sell dope, well why they won't indict me?
Advances on the throne, I ain't never take it lightly
But all that tongue-wrestlin' hatin' while I'm gone don't excite me
How many rappers you know that could hold they own on Rice Street
East steady talkin' on the cell phone nightly
Normal population, half the jail just like me
Polices think I'm crazy, scared a nigga gon' strike me
Contrarily, a nigga tryin' me is unlikely
They barkin' don't bother me, I'll be bombin' 'fore they bite me
They just shocked to see my rap's exactly how my life be
Sheisty, with a conversation quite pricey
My fist so rocky and and wrist so icey
Might be, thrown off my rocker just slightly
Feisty, flamin' hot temper don't ignite me
I'm only gonna ask ya find the exit once politely

[Hook]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Flip, say who known to the land and the people
My plan is to keep you at least 2, levels under me where I need you
I'mma take advantage of my chance to defeat you
Your true colors done shown, now it's on when I see you
I'm grown nigga, so let it be know we ain't equal
You sadly mistaken if you thinkin' I can't reach you
Beat you, to a fuckin' pulp if I need to
The very spot ya standin' in then is where I'll leave you
Seen on the scene white tees and Evisu
O.G. status, I don't beef unless I need to
Sissy you way outta line and you runnin' outta time
Hang behind closed do's when ya heard I got some time
Yeah I know you were thinkin' outa sight and outa mind
But I'm the wrong one for you to try if you were tryna shine
Listen nigga this shit here is more than just a lotta rhymes
I don't know what ya do for your respect, but I'mma die for mine

Tim and Bob
Bobby Valentino
You know how we do
It's another one

[Verse 1]
I saw you walking
Down on Melrose
You looked like an angel
Straight out of heaven, girl
I was blown away by
Your sexiness
All I have to do is catch up to you

[Chorus]
Slow down I just wanna get to know you
But don't turn around
'Cause that pretty round thing looks good to me
Slow down never seen anything so lovely
Now turn around
And bless me with your beauty, cutie

[Verse 2]
A butterfly tattoo
Right above your navel
Your belly button's pierced too just like I like it girl
Come take a walk with me
You'll be impressed by
The game that I kick to you
It's so thorough and real

[Bridge 1]
Like a flower fully bloomed in the summertime, you're ready
To be watered by this conversation, you're ready
I'm in awe cause you shine like the sun
Let me be the one to enjoy you (enjoy you)
Let's kick it girl

[Chorus]
So slow down I just wanna get to know you
But don't turn around
'Cause that pretty round thing looks good to me
Slow down never seen anything so lovely
Now turn around
And bless me with your beauty, cutie
Slow down I just wanna get to know you
But don't turn around
'Cause that pretty round thing looks good to me
Slow down never seen anything so lovely
Now turn around
And bless me with your beauty, cutie

[Bridge 2]
Oh baby you know by now that I want you bad
I'm floating on thin air I can't come down
Cupid hit me already damn
Now I can't leave till seven digits are in my hand, my hand

[Bridge 1]
Like a flower fully bloomed in the summertime, you're ready
To be watered by this conversation, you're ready
I'm in awe cause you shine like the sun
Let me be the one to enjoy you (enjoy you)
Let's kick it girl

[Chorus]
Slow down I just wanna get to know you
But don't turn around
'Cause that pretty round thing looks good to me
Slow down never seen anything so lovely

'Cause that pretty round thing looks good to me
Slow down never seen anything so lovely

You, I don't wanna tell you
Oh, looks good, oh, looks good
Slow down never seen anything so lovely

Slow down never seen anything so lovely

232,232,Boulevard Of Broken Dreams,"[Verse 1]
I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me, and I walk alone
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

[Chorus]
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

[Verse 2]
I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What's fucked up, and everything's all right
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

[Chorus]
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

[Guitar Solo]

233,233,My Sister,"[Verse 1]
Hey girl, it's me, I just called to tell you hi
Call me when you get this
Haven't talked lately so hard to find the time
Give the boys a big kiss
Tell them that I miss them
By the way, I miss you too

[Chorus 1]
I was thinking just today
About how we used to play
Barbie dolls and make-up
Tea parties, dress up
I remember how we'd fight
We'd make up and laugh all night
Wish we were kids again
My sister, my friend

[Verses 2]
Oh yeah, before I forget I met someone
I think I really like him
I was wondering if I'm jumping the gun
By going out on a limb
And invite him home for Christmas
To meet the family

[Chorus 2]
Seems like just yesterday
You brought home - oh, what's his name?
He had been drinking
What were you thinking?
After dinner he passed out
We can laugh about it now
'Cause we've learned a lot since then
My sister, my friend

[Bridge]
Do you think you could come and see me sometime soon?
We could just hang out like we used to

[Chorus 3]
It's late and I should go
But I can't hang up the phone
Until I tell you
What I don't tell you enough
Even though at times it seemed
We were more like enemies
I'd do it all again

235,235,Ass Like That,"[Intro]
Wow, baby

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
I don't believe it, it's almost too good to be true
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing

[Verse 1]
The way she moves, she's like a belly-dancer
She's shaking that ass to the new Nelly jams, I
Think someone's at the door but I don't think I'ma answer
Police saying ""freeze"" (oh!), d-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, ""freeze""? Please, I'm a human being
I have needs! I'm not done, not till I'm finished peeing
I am not resisting arrest, I am agreeing
Mr. Officer, I'm already on my knees
I can't get on the ground any further, it's impossible for me
And do not treat me like a murderer, I just like to pee
Pee, pee, yes, I make R&B, I sing song
It go ring-a-chong, a-ching-chong-chong-chong-ching
Sike, I joke, I joke! I kid, I kid!
If I offend, I'm sorry! Please, please, forgive!
For I am Triumph, the Puppet Dog, I am a mere puppet
I can get away with anything I say and you will love it

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
Jessica Simpson looks oh, so tempting
Nick, I ain't never seen an ass like that
Every time I see that show on MTV, my pee-pee goes
D-doing, doing, doing

[Verse 2]
Mary-Kate and Ashley used to be so wholesome
Now they getting older, they're starting to grow bum-bums
I go to the movies and sit down with my popcorn
Police saying ""freeze"" (oh!), d-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, ""freeze""? Geez, I just got my seat
I have ticket, look, I put it away, my zipper's zipped
Please do not remove me from this movie theater, please
I did not even get to see Mary-Kate shower scene
I didn't mean to be obscene or make a great, big scene
And don't treat me like I'm Pee-wee Herman, this movie's PG
Mr. Officer, I demand to see my attorney
I will simply plead innocent, cop a plea, and be free
Free, yes, free, right back on the streets
What do you mean my lawyer's with Michael, he's too busy?
I am Triumph, Britney Spears has shoulders like a man
And I can say that and you'll laugh
'Cause there's a puppet on my hand (hahaha!)

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
Hilary Duff is not quite old enough, so
I ain't never seen a butt like that
Maybe next year I'll say, ""ass"" and she'll make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing

[Verse 3]
The way she moves, she dances like a go-go
In that video, she sings, ""Get out, you bozo
I need a new boyfriend!"" Hi, my name is JoJo
Police saying ""freeze"" (oh!), d-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, ""freeze""? My computers will be seized
And my keys to my ranch, I just bake cookies
Mr. Officer, lookie, take a whiff of this
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this
Nobody is safe from me, no, not even me
I don't even know if I can say the word ""pee-pee""
Pee, on the radio, but I think I did
Janet, is that a breast? I think I just saw a tit!
Sike, I joke, I joke! I kid, I kid!
I don't think my joke is working, I must flee quick
Get to the chopper, everybody get out
I am not Triumph, I am Arnold, get down!

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
So Gwen Stefani, will you pee-pee on me, please?
I ain't never seen an ass like that
'Cause the way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing

Tell ya somethin' that ya might like to hear
Got a sexy ass body and ya ass look soft
Mind if I touch it to see if it's soft
Nah, I’m just playin' ‘less you say I can
And I'm known to be a real nasty man
And they say a closed mouth don't get fed
So I don't mind askin' fo' head
Ya heard what I said
We need to make our way to the bed
You can start usin' ya head
Ya like to fuck, have ya legs open all in the buck
Do it up, slappin' ass, gurl the sex get rough
Switch position and let the dick get down to business

You might had some, but you never had none like this

238,238,If Something Should Happen,"Buddy you and me go way back
Camp Lejeune, all through high school
And before that
So I don't mind telling you I'm scared to death
The doctor's going in on the 25th
It's the same thing my daddy had
Thank God they caught it fast

But if something should happen
Stop in sometime and say hello to Katherine
You and Mary Anne could always keep her laughing
She's going to need a lot of that
Take her out to a movie
Its going to take some time before she's back on her feet
I know you think that I'll be fine and I'm talking crazy
But there's always that chance
That's why I'm asking
If something should happen

Little Nathan's growing up so fast
This November he'll turn 10
He wants to play quarterback
I'm supposed to coach his team this fall
But I may not get to after all
He's going to need someone to catch a pass
And to throw it back

If something should happen
Oh promise me you'll take that boy out camping
Throw a line out in that water every now and then
Answer any question that he has
Maybe once he gets older
You can sit and have that first cold beer together
And tell him a couple stories on his father
He's always known you were my best friend
That's why I'm asking
If something should happen

I hope I live until I'm 80
And I get to see my son get married
And have babies
And make a million more memories with my wife
Yeah buddy I pray alright
But if its my time to leave
Would you watch over them for me?
If something should happen
If something should happen

Fell so hard to make us lose our faith

Still make lemonade taste like a sunny day

That's why I stay fly and I'm 'flage-ing on hoes
Floss is so cool, in Austin no shoes
Just a rubberband on my wrist, no jewels
I ain't got to prove I'm rich, I'm no fool
I know the rules and I ain't got time for it
But a nigga will shine, when it's time for it
And they will hate you deal with the real cake
And they on the corner from morning to real late
I deal weight and if you bastards doubt me
I'm a hustler, ask about me

[Verse 3]
To get paid you got a save dont be spending the change
In 5th grade I was hustling my Genesis games
I was dumb, young, selling chewing gum to my classmates
On the cash chase moving at a fast pace
Never been a dummy, never did what the dummies do
So I had a mill' to burn before I turned 22
""More money, more problems"" is true
Because the more money I make, the more problems for you
Yeah, I used dude's voice, props to the boy Shawn
He made it a hot line, I made a hot song
So, stop drawing, man, you got to respect it
I'm the best, Swizz got to perfect it, don't mess with
C-A-double-S-I-D-Y
'Cause I became the best when B-I-G died
The Kid do it big like P-U-N
Cause I'm nice P-A-C with the P-E-N and

And don't sneak out of a 2 story house usin' bed sheets for a rope

Don't bust your buddy in the nose when you know he didn't mean it

Someone falls to pieces sleeping all alone
Someone kills the pain
Spinning in the silence
She finally drifts away
Someone gets excited in a chapel yard
Catches a bouquet
Another lays a dozen
White roses on a grave

Yeah and to be yourself is all that you can do
Hey, to be yourself is all that you can do

Someone finds salvation in everyone, another only pain
Someone tries to hide himself, down inside himself he prays
Someone swears his true love until the end of time, another runs away
Separate or united, healthy or insane

243,243,Hate It Or Love It,"[Produced By: Cool & Dre]

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh-huh

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, ""Check, check out my melody""
I wanna live good so, shit, I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next morning, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

[Hook: 50 Cent & The Game]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me

[Verse 2: The Game]
(G-G-G-G-G-Unit!) On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires
I'll fo'-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song
And really do it, that's the true meaning of a ghostwriter
10 G's will take your daughter out her Air Forces
Believe you me, homie, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped, like car seats
Been bangin' since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's 10 years, I told Pooh in '95
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'ma ride
And if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide
I ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm going back to Cali
With my Jacob on, see how time fly?

[Hook: 50 Cent & The Game]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me

[Bridge: 50 Cent]
From the beginning to the end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real, we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me, nigga, now listen to Game

[Verse 3: The Game]
Used to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense
My mom's happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starvin'
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know what's going on, like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted
I think, ""What if Marie Baker got that abortion?"" I love you, ma

[Hook: 50 Cent & The Game]

Oh snap, these bitches they act like cats
In the middle of the dance floor now they preparing to scrap
They takin out their scrunchies and pullin off their press-ons
The one on the right is the girlfriend and the one the left is another woman
Someone please call securty, these girls too perty
To get down to the nitty titty

246,246,The Talkin' Song Repair Blues,"The mechanic raised up from under my hood
He shook his head and said, ""This ain't good
Your timin' belt's done, shrunk one size too small
Those spark plug wires are a little too long
And your main prodsponder's nearly gone
Your injector ports are stripped and that ain't all.""

""The torque converter's runnin' low on torque
And that water pump's nearly down a quart
But we caught it all in time so you're in luck""
He said, ""I've got the time and I've got the parts
Just give me the word and I'm ready to start
I think we can bring her in for eight hundred bucks.""

But don't be downhearted, I can fix it for you, sonny
It won't take too long, it'll just take money
Then he said, ""Ain't you that songwriter guy?""
I said, ""Yes, I am,"" he said, ""So am I.""

And he sat down and played me a song by the grease rack
When he finished singin' he gave me a smile
And I closed my eyes and pondered awhile
And he said, ""What do you think? Now don't hold nothin' back.""

Well, I gave him my most sorrowful look
And I said, ""This song's got a broken hook
I can order you a new one from Nashville but it won't be cheap
And I know you've been using a cut-rate thesaurus
'Cause your adverbs have backed up into your chorus
Now your verse is runnin' on verbs that are way too weak.""

But don't be downhearted, I can fix it for you, sonny
It won't take too long, it'll just take money
And I said, ""Hold on friend now I'm not through
I hate to be the one to give you the news

But your whole melodic structure's worked itself loose
It's got so many dotted eighth notes in it
I'd keep her under fifty beats per minute
I mean, that's just me talkin', it's really up to you.""

And you've got a bad safety problem with
That dominant chord with the augmented fifth
Just see how dangerously high it raises you up
So just go on over there and work on my car
I'll sit here by the fan and chances are
I can straighten this thing out for eig...nine hundred bucks.""

But don't be downhearted, I can fix it for you, sonny
It won't take too long

247,247,Live Like You Were Dying,"[Verse 1]
Said I was in my early 40's
With a lot of life before me
When a moment came that stopped me on a dime
I spent most of the next days, lookin' at the x-rays
Talkin' 'bout the options and talkin' 'bout sweet time
Asked him when it sank in
That this might really be the real end
How's it hit ya, when you get that kind of news
Man what ya do
And he says

[Chorus 1]
I went sky divin'
I went Rocky Mountain climbin'
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I've been denying
And he said someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'

[Verse 2]
He said I was finally the husband
That most the time I wasn't
And I became a friend a friend would like to have
And all the sudden goin' fishing
Wasn't such an imposition
And I went three times that year I lost my dad
Well I finally read the good book
And I took a good long hard look at what I'd do
If I could do it all again
And then

[Chorus 1]
I went sky divin'
I went Rocky Mountain climbin'
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I've been denying
And he said someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'

[Bridge]
Like tomorrow was a gift and you've got eternity
To think about what you do with it
What could you do with it, what can
I do with with it, what would I do with it

[Chorus 2]
Sky divin'
I went Rocky Mountain climbin'
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I watched an eagle as it was flying
And he said someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'

Yeah, uh-huh
So seductive

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Olivia]
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead, girl, don't you stop
Keep going 'til you hit the spot, whoa
I'll take you to the candy shop
Boy, one taste what I got
I'll have you spendin' all you got
Keep going 'til you hit the spot, whoa

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
You could have it your way, how do you want it?
You gonna back that thing up or should I push up on it?
Temperature rising, okay, let's go to the next level
Dance floor jam-packed, hot as a tea kettle
I break it down for you now, baby, it's simple
If you be a nympho, I be a nympho
In the hotel or in the back of the rental
On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into
Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor
Have your friends teasing you about how sprung I got you
When you show me what you working, baby, no problem
Get on top, get your bounce around like a low rider
I'm a seasoned vet when it come to this shit
After you work up a sweat, you could play with the stick
I'm trying to explain, baby, the best way I can
I melt in your mouth, girl, not in your hand (uh-huh)

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Olivia]
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead, girl, don't you stop
Keep going 'til you hit the spot, whoa
I'll take you to the candy shop
Boy, one taste what I got
I'll have you spendin' all you got
Keep going 'til you hit the spot, whoa

[Bridge: 50 Cent & Olivia]
Girl, what we do, what we do
And where we do, and where we do
The things we do, things we do
Are just between me and you, yeah, oh yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Give it to me, baby, nice and slow
Climb on top, ride like you in a rodeo
You ain't never heard a sound like this before
‘Cause I ain't never put it down like this
Soon as I come through the door
She kept pulling on my zipper
It's like a race, who can get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic, how erotic it is to watch her in thongs?
Had me thinking about that ass after I'm gone
I touched the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she whine
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind
Long as she ain't stoppin', homie, and I ain't stoppin'
Dripping wet with sweat, man, it's on and poppin'
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle, it's on
And we gon' sip ‘til every bubble in every bottle is gone

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Olivia]
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead, girl, don't you stop
Keep going 'til you hit the spot, whoa
I'll take you to the candy shop
Boy, one taste what I got
I'll have you spendin' all you got

249,249,Breakaway,"[Verse 1]
Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreaming of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray (I would pray)

[Verse 2]
Trying hard to reach out
But when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I prayed (I would pray) I could break away

[Chorus 1]
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

[Verse 3]
Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get onboard a fast train
Travel on a jet plane, far away (I will)
And breakaway

[Chorus 1]
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
I won't forget all the ones that I love (I gotta)
I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

[Bridge]
Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging around revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me, but
Gotta keep moving on, moving on
Fly away, breakaway

[Chorus 2]
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly (Learn how to fly)
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget of the place I come from
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

Alright. Come on. Alright, alright, let's do this

[Intro: Akon]
Yo, this one here goes out
To all my players out there, man
You know, that got that one good girl, dawg
That's always been there, man
Like, took all the bullshit
But then one day she can't take it no more
And decides to leave

[Verse 1: Akon]
Yeah, I woke up in the middle of the night
And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side
Could've sworn I was dreamin'
For her I was feenin'
So I had to take a little ride
Backtrackin' on these few years
Tryin' to figure out what I do to make it go bad
‘Cause ever since my girl left me
My whole life came crashin', and I'm so…

[Hook: Bobby Vinton & (Akon)]
Lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own, girl)
Oh, I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own, girl)
Oh, I'm so lonely

[Verse 2: Akon]
Can't believe I had a girl like you
And I just let you walk right out of my life
After all I put you through
You still stuck around and stayed by my side
What really hurt me is I broke your heart
Baby, you a good girl and I had no right
I really wanna make things right
‘Cause without you in my life, girl, I'm so…

[Hook: Bobby Vinton & (Akon)]
Lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own, girl)
Oh, I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own, baby)
Oh, I'm so lonely

[Verse 3: Akon]
Been all about the world
Ain't never met a girl
That could take the things that you been through
Never thought the day would come
Where you would get up and run
And I would be out chasin' you
‘Cause ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be
Ain't no one in the globe I'd rather see
Than the girl of my dreams that made me be
So happy, but now so lonely

[Hook: Bobby Vinton & (Akon)]
Lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own, no)
Oh, I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own, girl)
Oh, I'm so lonely

[Verse 4]
Never thought that I'd be alone
I didn't think you'd be gone this long
I just want you to call my phone
So stop playin', girl, and come on home
Baby girl, I didn't mean to shout
I want me and you to work it out
I never wished that I would ever hurt my baby
And it's drivin' me crazy, ‘cause I'm so…

[Hook: Bobby Vinton & (Akon)]

It's kinda crazy babe
How I remember things, (like where you came from and how you had nothin)
I went and made you fly
Put extras on your ride, (didn't miss a birthday now you can't even remember mine)

[Pre-Chorus]
You made it clear to me (you wasn't down for me)
(Love made me blind, baby) but now I see
(you had things up your sleeve, don't even lie to me) I even heard it from your family

[Chorus]
How could you let somebody lay where I laid?
How could you give him everything that we made?
How could you call him all the names that you used to call me?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?
How could you teach him all the things I taught you?
How could you put him on to the Ghetto Kama Sutra?
How could you put me in the back and give him the front seat?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?

[Verse 2]
You must be out your mind
You got a lot of nerve (to think that I'm gon' chill after all the shit I heard)
I damn near carried you
I could've married you
Good thing I found out before I bought that 7 karat for you

[Pre-Chorus]
(I know your sick about) the way I found you out
(Go head and pack it out) I hope he's got room in his house
You should have thought of me before you hopped in them sheets
Damn I can't believe that you did this to me

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Girl I tried to give you everything
Can't believe the ways you repaid me
Girl you had it all
But I guess my all wasn't good enough for you
Baby I've accepted it
And I ain't gone trip
Girl I'm moving on
Sometimes I can't help but think that another man's gonna get the one I made for me

I can't blame you if you want to leave
Cuz' I'm not the man that I once used to be
But there's a change that has come over me
So before you go listen to my last plead

[Hook]
(All because of you)
Ooh you're the love of my life
And I was doing wrong but I wanna do right
(All because of you)
No more staying out all night
I wanna make it right wanna change my life
(All because of you)
I don't wanna play no games
Wanna change your name to my name baby
(All because of you)
Not gon' be the man that I used to be no
(I changed because of you)

Can't take back the things that I did before
But baby I'm promising that my heart is yours[yours]
I know it ain't easy baby

I'm turning in my player's card
All because of you

[Young Rome]
You know let's go
I used to be the dude up in the club poppin' bottles wrist glistening
Shorty tried to tell me chill but I wasn't listening
I can't deny it you knew me for being immature
Only way of saying sorry take you to the ?? store
You told me all you really wanted was to see me more
Then the stress hit me hard like a meteor
I hit rock bottom you was there to pick me up
I neglected you we didn't hug didn't kiss enough
But you never threw nothing up in my face
Gave me all your love and your warm embrace yeah
Now I see I'll never find another like you
You the type boo make a playa wanna wife you
With me and you, this money's not an issue
And I miss you when I touch you I can feel it in my bone gristle
I'm still with you and I'm sorry bout the way I did you
Know it must have igged you but the trackman you know I'm getting?

Well I was sitting, waiting, wishing
You believed in superstitions
Then maybe you'd see the signs

But lord knows that this world is cruel
And I ain't  the lord no I'm just a fool
Learning loving somebody don't make them love you

[Chorus]
Must I always be waiting, waiting on you?
Must I always be playing, playing your fool?

[Verse 2]
I sang your songs I danced your dance
I gave your friends all a chance
But putting up with them
Wasn't worth never having you

Ah maybe you've been through this before
But it's my first time so please ignore
The next few lines 'cause they're directed at you

[Chorus]
I can't always be waiting, waiting on you
I can't always be playing, playing your fool

[Bridge]
I keep playing your part
But it's not my scene
Want this plot to twist
I've had enough mystery
Keep building it up
But then you're shooting me down
But I'm already down

[Refrain]
Just wait a minute
Just sitting, waiting
Just wait a minute
Just sitting, waiting

[Verse 3]
Well if I was in your position
I'd put down all my ammunition
I'd wonder why'd it taken me so long

But lord knows that I'm not you
And if I was I wouldn't be so cruel
'Cause waiting on love
Ain't so easy to do

[Chorus]
Must I always be waiting, waiting on you?
Must I always be playing, playing your fool?

Just wanted you to know

[Intro]
Uno por pobre y feo, home'
Pero antojao'

[Verso 1]
Tengo la camisa negra
Hoy mi amor está de luto
Hoy tengo en el alma una pena
Y es por culpa de tu embrujo
Hoy sé que tú ya no me quieres
Y eso es lo que más me hiere
Que tengo la camisa negra
Y una pena que me duele

[Pre-Coro]
Mal parece que solo me quedé
Y fue pura todita tu mentira
Qué maldita mala suerte la mía
Que aquel día te encontré
Por beber del veneno malevo de tu amor
Yo quedé moribundo y lleno de dolor
Respiré de ese humo amargo de tu adiós
Y desde que tú te fuiste yo solo tengo

[Coro]
Tengo la camisa negra
Porque negra tengo el alma
Yo por ti perdí la calma
Y casi pierdo hasta mi cama
Cama-cama, come on, baby
Te digo con disimulo
Que tengo la camisa negra
Y debajo tengo el difunto

[Interludio]
¡Pa' enterrártelo cuando quieras, mamita!
Así como lo oye, mija

[Verso 2]
Tengo la camisa negra
Ya tu amor no me interesa
Lo que ayer me supo a gloria
Hoy me sabe a pura
Miércoles por la tarde y tú que no llegas
Ni siquiera muestras señas
Y yo con la camisa negra
Y tus maletas en la puerta

[Pre-Coro]
Mal parece que solo me quedé
Y fue pura todita tu mentira
Que maldita mala suerte la mía
Que aquel día te encontré
Por beber del veneno malevo de tu amor
Yo quedé moribundo y lleno de dolor
Respiré de ese humo amargo de tu adiós
Y desde que tú te fuiste yo solo tengo

Porque negra tengo el alma
Yo por ti perdí la calma
Y casi pierdo hasta mi cama

259,259,Almost,"[Verse 1]
I almost got drunk at school at 14
Where I almost made out with the Homecoming Queen
Who almost went on to be Miss Texas
But lost to a slut with much bigger breastes
I almost dropped out to move to L.A
Where I was almost famous for almost a day

[Chorus]
And I almost had you
But I guess that doesn't cut it
Almost loved you
I almost wish you would've loved me too

[Verse 2]
I almost held up a grocery store
Where I almost did 5 years and then 7 more
Cause I almost got popped for a fight with a thug
Cause he almost made off with a bunch of the drugs
That I almost got hooked on cause you ran away
And I wish I would've had the nerve to ask you to stay

[Chorus]
And I almost had you
But I guess that doesn't cut it
Almost had you
And I didn't even know it
You kept me guessin'
And now I'm destined
To spend my time missin' you
I almost wish you would've loved me too

[Verse 3]
Here I go thinking about all the things I could've done
I'm gonna need a forklift cause all the baggage ways a ton
I know we had our problems; I can't remember one

[Bridge]
I almost forgot to say something else
And if I can't fit it in I'll keep it all to myself
I almost wrote a song about you today
But I tore it all up and then I threw it away!

[Chorus]
And I almost had you
But I guess that doesn't cut it
Almost had you
And I didn't even know it
You kept me guessin'

260,260,Songs About Me,"[Verse 1]
I met a guy on the red eye
He spotted my guitar and said what do you do?
I said, I sing for a livin'
Country music mixed with a little rock and a little blues
He said I'm sorry but I've never been crazy
'Bout that twang and trains and hillbilly thing
What ever made you want to sing stuff like that?
I just looked at him and laughed and said

[Chorus]
'Cause it's songs about me
And who I am
Songs about lovin' and livin'
And good hearted women and family and God
Yeah they're all just
Songs about me
Songs about me

[Verse 2]
So I offered him tickets
I said you'll see what I mean if you show up tonight
He said I doubt you'll change my opinion
I'll be kind of busy, but hey man, I'll try
Then later on when we finished our songs
About scars and cars and broken hearts
I saw him, he was standing there right next to the stage
And he shouted, man you were right it was like you sang those

[Chorus]
Songs about me
And who I am
Songs about lovin' and livin'
And good hearted women and family and God
Yeah they're all just
Songs about me
Songs about me

So I'll just keep on singin'
Till I hear the whole world singin', those ole

Get my drink on, then get on the dance floor

Pay attention, boy, I'll teach you how to do this shit

Nigga, I'm serious, I ain't playing
I'll embed it in your brain, I'm off the chain, G-Unit

If I was a rich girl
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
See, I'd have all the money in the world
If I was a wealthy girl
No man could test me, impress me
My cash flow would never ever end
'Cause I'd have all the money in the world
If I was a wealthy girl

[Verse 1: Gwen Stefani]
Think what that money could bring
I'd buy everything
Clean out Vivienne Westwood
In my Galliano gown
No, wouldn't just have one hood
A Hollywood mansion if I could
Please book me first class to my fancy house in London town

[Pre-Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
All the riches, baby, won't mean anything
All the riches, baby, don't bring what your love can bring
All the riches, baby, won't mean anything
Don't need no other, baby
Your loving is better than gold, and I know

[Verse 2: Gwen Stefani]
I'd get me four Harajuku girls to (Uh-huh) inspire me
And they'd come to my rescue
I'd dress them wicked, I'd give them names (Yeah)
Love, Angel, Music, Baby
Hurry up and come and save me

[Pre-Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
All the riches, baby, won't mean anything
All the riches, baby, won't bring what your love can bring
All the riches, baby, won't mean anything
Don't need no other, baby
Your loving is better than gold, and I know

[Verse 3: Eve & (Gwen Stefani)]
Come together all over the world
From the hoods to Japan, Harajuku Girls
What? It's all love
What? Give it up! What?
(Shouldn't matter, shouldn't matter
Shouldn't matter, shouldn't matter) What?
Come together all over the world
From the hoods to Japan, Harajuku Girls
What? It's all love
What? Give it up! What?
(Shouldn't matter, shouldn't matter
Shouldn't matter, shouldn't matter)

[Verse 4: Eve & Gwen Stefani]
What happened to my life? Turned upside down
Chicks that Blew Ya Mind, ding, it's the second round
Original track and ting, oh
You know you can't buy these things, no
See Stefani and her L.A.M.B
I rock the Fetish, people you know who I am!
Yes, ma'am, we got the style that's wicked
I hope you can all keep up
We climbed all the way from the bottom to the top
Now we ain't gettin' nothing but love

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
If I was a rich girl

[Verse 1]
Oh, been trying to let it go
Trying to keep my eyes closed
Trying to keep it just like before
The times we never even thought to speak
Don’t wanna tell you what it is
Oh wee it felt so serious
Got me thinking just too much
I wanna set it off, but

It's this one thing that’s got me trippin'
It's this one thing that's got me trippin' (You did)
This one thing my soul may be feelin'

Hey, we don’t know each other well
So why I keep picking up my cell?
Memories just keep ringing bells
Oh oh, oh oh, oh
Hear voices I don’t want to understand
My car keys are jingling in my hand
My high heels are clicking towards your door
Oh oh, oh oh, oh

Maybe I just can’t believe it
It’s this one thing you did oh oh
I can’t deny, tired of trying
Nothing left to do but to keep on seeing you
I’m hoping you can keep a secret
For me, for me, for me
But what you did, yeah

265,265,Goin' Crazy,"[Verse 1]
Ever since the day you went away and left me lonely and cold
My life just hasn't been the same, oh baby, no
When I looked into your eyes, the moment that I let you go
I just broke down (Down)

[Verse 2]
Baby, if I ever get the chance to be with you again
I would sacrifice
'Cause the feeling that I feel within
No other man would ever make me feel so right
It's nice to smile when I get your phone call at night
But I'd rather have you here with me, right next to me
I miss the way you hold me tight

[Pre-Chorus]
I gotta let you know I feel so weak without your touch
I never thought that I could ever love a man so much
I gotta let you know I think that we are destiny
For you, I'd cross the world
For you, I'd do anything

[Chorus]
That's right, baby
I'm goin' crazy
I needa be your lady
I've been thinkin' lately
That you and me
Yes, we can make it
Just ride with me, roll with me
I'm in love with you, baby
That's right, baby
I'm goin' crazy
I needa be your lady
I've been thinkin' lately
That you and me
Yes, we can make it
Just ride with me, roll with me
I'm in love with you, baby

[Verse 3]
Break it down now, I'll tell you what I feel
From the moment that I met, you its been so damn real
My heart seems to skip another beat
Every time we speak, I can't believe I feel so weak
Tell me that you really need me and you want me and you miss me
And you love me, I'm your lady
I'll be around waitin' for you
I'll put it down, be the woman for you

[Bridge]
I'm fallin' so deep for you, crazy over for you
I'm callin', callin' out to you
What am I gonna do?
It's true, no frontin'
It's you and no other, I can no longer go on without you
I'll just break down (Down)

[Pre-Chorus]
I gotta let you know I feel so weak without your touch
I never thought that I could ever love a man so much
I gotta let you know I think that we are destiny
For you, I'd cross the world
For you, I'd do anything

267,267,Anything But Mine,"[Verse 1]
Walking alone beneath the lights of that miracle mile
Me and Mary making our way into the night
You can hear the cries from the carnival rides
The pinball bells, ski ball slides
Watching the summer sun fall out of sight
There's a warm wind coming in from off of the ocean
Making it's way past the hotel walls to fill the streets
Mary is holding both of her shoes in her hands
Said she likes to feel the sand beneath her feet

[Chorus]
And in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine
And I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine

[Verse 2]
There's a local band playing at the sea side pavilion
And I got just enough cash to get us in
And as we are dancing Mary's wrapping her arms around me
And I can feel the sting of summer on my skin
In the midst of the music I tell her I love her
We both laugh cause we know it isn't true
But Mary there's a summer drawing to an end tonight
And there's so much that I long to do to you

[Chorus]
But in the morning I'm leaving, making my way back to Cleveland
So tonight I hope that I will do just fine
And I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine

Check check
This happened for real
Baby Bash
Yo, Frankie J, obsession

[Verse 1: Frankie J]
Well, it's early in the morning
And my heart is feeling lonely
Just thinkin' 'bout you, baby
Got me twisted in the head
And I don't know how to take it
But it's driving me so crazy
I don't know if it's right
I'm tossin' turning in my bed

[Pre-Chorus: Frankie J]
It's 5 o'clock in the morning
And I still can't sleep
Thinkin' 'bout your beauty, it makes me weak
I'm feeling hopeless in my home
I don't know what to do I think I'm in love
Baby

[Chorus: Frankie J]
Amor, no es amor (If this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling? What am I doing wrong?
Amor, no es amor (If this ain't love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart?

[Verse 2: Frankie J]
Now, I know you're not my lady
But I'm just tryna make this right
I don't know what to do, I'm going out of my mind
So baby, if you let me
Kick it witchu, well then maybe
We could ride together, we could do this all night
Now I don't care if you got a man
Baby, I wish you'd understand
'Cause I know he can't love you right, quite like I can

[Pre-Chorus: Frankie J]
It's 5 o'clock in the morning
And I still can't sleep
Thinkin' 'bout your beauty it makes me weak
I'm feeling hopeless at home
I don't know what to do I think I'm in love

[Chorus: Frankie J]
Amor, no es amor (If this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling? What am I doing wrong?
Amor, no es amor (If this ain't love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart?

[Bridge: Frankie J]
I love the way you freaky like that
I love the way you freaky like that
I love the way you freaky like that
It's an obsession

[Verse 3: Baby Bash]
Hold up, let me dream
Shorty got me feelin' serene
Where my candy, where my cream?
Got your boy feel less supreme
Hold up, wait a minute
Baby, you so damn independent
Loving everything your representing
Got a lot of money, and I love to spend it
And that's what's up and I don't care what people scream
You're my blessin' when I'm stressin'
My superfly beauty queen
Imma keep it saucy 'cause my ma know how I do
We go rendezvous
Mi corazon belongs to you

[Chorus: Frankie J]
Amor, no es amor (If this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling? What am I doing wrong?
(What am I doing wrong?)
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart?
Amor, no es amor (If this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling? What am I doing wrong?
(What am I doing so wrong?)
Amor, no es amor (If this ain't love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart?

269,269,That's What I Love About Sunday,"[Verse 1]
Raymond's in his Sunday best, he's usually up to his chest
In oil and grease
There's the Martin's walking in, with that mean little freckle-faced kid
Who broke a window last week

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Sweet Miss Betty likes to sing off-key in the pew behind me

[Chorus 1]
That's what I love about Sunday
Sing along as the choir sways
Every verse of Amazing Grace
And then we shake the preacher's hand
Go home, into your blue jeans
Have some chicken and some baked beans
Pick a backyard football team
Not do much of anything
That's what I love about Sunday

[Verse 2]
I stroll to the end of the drive, pick up the Sunday Times
Grab a coffee cup
It looks like Sally and Ron, finally tied the knot
Well, it's about time

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's thirty-five cents off of ground round, baby, cut that coupon out

[Chorus 2]
That's what I love about Sunday
Cat-napping on the porch swing
You curled up next to me
The smell of jasmine wakes us up
Take a walk down a back road
Tackle box and a cane pole
Carve our names in that white oak
And steal a kiss as the sun fades
That's what I love about Sunday, oh yeah

[Bridge]
Ooh, new believers getting baptized
Momma's hands raised up high
Ain't it a Hallelujah good time
A smile on everybody's face
That's what I love about Sunday, oh yeah

You drive the men folk crazy

To find a man like mine
But honey

Yeah baby, hehe, yeah!
Back again (that's right) Luda! Ha ha ha ha (Feel this)
It gets meaner and meaner each time baby
Feelin real good too (holla at 'em man) What up Uncle 'Face! (Yeah)
I'm a bull in this industry man (tell 'em)
Some would rather run down and get one cow (nah)
I think I'd rather walk down and get 'em all
You know what I'm talkin 'bout right? Look

[Verse 1]
I'm never going nowhere so don't try me
My music sticks in fans' veins like an IV
Flows poison like Ivy, oh they grimy
Already offers on my 6th album from labels tryin to sign me
Respected highly, ""Hi, Mr. O'Reilly!""
Hope all is well, kiss the plaintiff and the wifey
Drove through the window, the industry super sized me
Now the girls see me and a river's what they cry me
I'm on the rise, so many people despise me
Got party ammunition for those tryin to surprise me (surprise!)
It's a celebration and everyone should invite me
Roll with the crew or meet the bottom of our Nikes (blaow!)
Explorer like Dora these swipers can't swipe me
My whole aura's so MEAN in my white tee
Nobody light-skinned did reppin harder since Ice-T
You disagree, take the Tyson approach and bite me!

Keep it goin' it won't stop! (What you doin' man?)
I'm comin' for that number one spot!

[Verse 2]
Yes indeed, Ludacris I'm hotter than Nevada
Ready to break the steerin' column on yo' Impala
If I get caught, bail out, po'-po' I tell 'em holla
In court I never show up, like Austin Powers fa-zha
Father, father, and hey I love gold
But can buy anything I want from the records I've sold
Jacuzzi's hot, Cristal is so cold
Neighbors catch contacts, from the blunts that I've rolled
A pig in a blanket, a smoke and a pancake
Drop albums non-stop once a year for my fans sake
I crush mics until my hand breaks
Then shag now and shag later 'til these women can't stand straight
The Luda-meister got 'em feelin so randy
I'm +XXL+ so I call 'em my +Eye Candy+
Brush my shoulder and I, pop my collar
Cause I'm worth a million ga-zillion fa-fillion dollars

Causin' lyrical disasters, it's the master
Make music for Mini-Me's, models and Fat Bastards
These women trying to get me out my Pelle Pelle
They strip off my clothes and tell me, ""Get in my belly!""
Stay on the track, hit the ground runnin like Flo-Jo
Sent back in time and I've never lost my mojo
Ladies and gentlemen ahh, boys and girls

273,273,Karma,"[Verse 1]
Weren't you the one that said that you don't want me anymore
And how you need your space and give the keys back to your door
And how I cried and tried and tried to make you stay with me
But still you said that love was gone and that I had to leave

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you, talkin' 'bout a family
Now you, saying I complete your dream
Now you, saying I'm your everything
You're confusing me
What you say to me
Don't play with me
Don't play with me

[Chorus]
'Cause what goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me
What goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back

[Post-Chorus]
I remember when
I was sittin' home alone
Waitin' for you
Til three o'clock in the morn'

[Verse 2]
And when you came home, you'd always have some sorry excuse
And explaining to me, like I'm just some kind of a fool
I sacrificed the things I want just to do things for you
But when it's time to do for me, you never come through

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you, wanna be a part of me (Ayy)
Now you, have so much to say to me (Hey)
Now you, wanna make time for me
What you doin' to me?
You're confusing me
Don't play with me
Don't play with me

[Chorus]
'Cause what goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me
What goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back

[Post-Chorus]
I remember when
I was sittin' home alone
Waiting for you
Til three o'clock in the morn

[Bridge]
Night after night
Knowing something going on
Wasn't home before me
You was, you was gone
Lord knows it wasn't easy, but believe me
Never thought you'd be the one that would deceived me
And never do what you was supposed to do
No need to approach me boo, 'cause I'm over you

[Chorus]
'Cause what goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me
What goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down
Gotta stop tryin', to come back to me
What goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down

[Outro]
It's called Karma, baby
And it goes around
What goes around, comes around
What goes up, must comes down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me","['werent', 'you', 'the', 'one', 'that', 'say', 'that', 'you', 'dont', 'want', 'me', 'anymore', 'and', 'how', 'you', 'need', 'your', 'space', 'and', 'give', 'the', 'key', 'back', 'to', 'your', 'door', 'and', 'how', 'i', 'cry', 'and', 'try', 'and', 'try', 'to', 'make', 'you', 'stay', 'with', 'me', 'but', 'still', 'you', 'say', 'that', 'love', 'be', 'go', 'and', 'that', 'i', 'have', 'to', 'leave', 'now', 'you', 'talkin', 'bout', 'a', 'family', 'now', 'you', 'say', 'i', 'complete', 'your', 'dream', 'now', 'you', 'say', 'im', 'your', 'everything', 'youre', 'confuse', 'me', 'what', 'you', 'say', 'to', 'me', 'dont', 'play', 'with', 'me', 'dont', 'play', 'with', 'me', 'cause', 'what', 'go', 'around', 'come', 'around', 'what', 'go', 'up', 'must', 'come', 'down', 'now', 'whos', 'cry', 'desire', 'to', 'come', 'back', 'to', 'me', 'what', 'go', 'around', 'come', 'around', 'what', 'go', 'up', 'must', 'come', 'down', 'now', 'whos', 'cry', 'desire', 'to', 'come', 'back', 'i', 'remember', 'when', 'i', 'be', 'sittin', 'home', 'alone', 'waitin', 'for', 'you', 'til', 'three', 'oclock', 'in', 'the', 'morn', 'and', 'when', 'you', 'come', 'home', 'youd', 'always', 'have', 'some', 'sorry', 'excuse', 'and', 'explain', 'to', 'me', 'like', 'im', 'just', 'some', 'kind', 'of', 'a', 'fool', 'i', 'sacrifice', 'the', 'things', 'i', 'want', 'just', 'to', 'do', 'things', 'for', 'you', 'but', 'when', 'its', 'time', 'to', 'do', 'for', 'me', 'you', 'never', 'come', 'through', 'now', 'you', 'wanna', 'make', 'time', 'for', 'me', 'what', 'you', 'doin', 'to', 'me', 'youre', 'confuse', 'me', 'dont', 'play', 'with', 'me', 'dont', 'play', 'with', 'me', 'cause', 'what', 'go', 'around', 'come', 'around', 'what', 'go', 'up', 'must', 'come', 'down', 'now', 'whos', 'cry', 'desire', 'to', 'come', 'back', 'to', 'me', 'what', 'go', 'around', 'come', 'around', 'what', 'go', 'up', 'must', 'come', 'down', 'now', 'whos', 'cry', 'desire', 'to', 'come', 'back', 'i', 'remember', 'when', 'i', 'be', 'sittin', 'home', 'alone', 'wait', 'for', 'you', 'til', 'three', 'oclock', 'in', 'the', 'morn', 'night', 'after', 'night', 'know', 'something', 'go', 'on', 'wasnt', 'home', 'before', 'me', 'you', 'be', 'you', 'be', 'go', 'lord', 'know', 'it', 'wasnt', 'easy', 'but', 'believe', 'me', 'never', 'think', 'youd', 'be', 'the', 'one', 'that', 'would', 'deceive', 'me', 'and', 'never', 'do', 'what', 'you', 'be', 'suppose', 'to', 'do', 'no', 'need', 'to', 'approach', 'me', 'boo', 'cause', 'im', 'over', 'you', 'cause', 'what', 'go', 'around', 'come', 'around', 'what', 'go', 'up', 'must', 'come', 'down', 'now', 'whos', 'cry', 'desire', 'to', 'come', 'back', 'to', 'me', 'what', 'go', 'around', 'come', 'around', 'what', 'go', 'up', 'must', 'come', 'down', 'gotta', 'stop', 'tryin', 'to', 'come', 'back', 'to', 'me', 'what', 'go', 'around', 'come', 'around', 'what', 'go', 'up', 'must', 'come', 'down', 'its', 'call', 'karma', 'baby', 'and', 'it', 'go', 'around', 'what', 'go', 'around', 'come', 'around', 'what', 'go', 'up', 'must', 'come', 'down', 'now', 'whos', 'cry', 'desire', 'to', 'come', 'back', 'to', 'me']",403,Alicia Keys,Alicia Keys,2005,"[46, 45, 36, 28, 23, 22, 20, 23, 21, 26, 24, 80, 31, 70, 38, 64, 40, 56, 36, 51, 38, 41, 34, 44, 28, 39, 19, 29, 17, 29, 21, 29, 21, 36, 19, 36, 19, 44]",38,Karma,https://open.spotify.com/track/588RGyR1f4Plc8nm7SrdCa,588RGyR1f4Plc8nm7SrdCa,spotify:track:588RGyR1f4Plc8nm7SrdCa,The Diary Of Alicia Keys,6TqRKHLjDu5QZuC8u5Woij,spotify:album:6TqRKHLjDu5QZuC8u5Woij,Alicia Keys,3DiDSECUqqY1AuBP8qtaIa,spotify:artist:3DiDSECUqqY1AuBP8qtaIa,256.0,15.0,52.0,2003-12-02,0.727,0.736,10.0,-6.202999999999999,1.0,0.0615,0.0743,0.0031100000000000004,0.0347,0.687,85.1,"['hip pop', 'neo soul', 'pop', 'r&b', 'urban contemporary']",[],1.0
274,274,Caught Up,"[Verse 1]
I'm the kind of brother
Who been doing it my way, getting my way for years
In my career
And every lover
In and out my life, I've hit, love and left the tears
Without a care

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Until I met this girl who turned the tables around
She caught me by surprise
I never thought I'd be the one breaking down
I can't figure it out, why...

[Chorus]
I'm so (caught up)
Got me feeling it (caught up)
I don't know what it is
But it seems she's got me twisted
I'm so (caught up)
Got me feeling it (caught up)
I'm losing control
This girl's got a hold on me

[Break 1]
Let me go, baby
Now, listen...

[Verse 2]
My mama told me
Be careful who you do 'cause karma comes back around
Same old song
But I was so sure
That it wouldn't happen to me 'cause I know how to put it down
But I was so wrong

[Pre-Chorus 2]
This girl was mean, she really turned me out
Her body was so tight, I'm looking for her in the daytime with a flashlight
My homies say this girl is cramping my style
And I can't figure it out, but...

[Chorus]
I'm so (caught up)
Got me feeling it (caught up)
I don't know what it is
But it seems she's got me twisted
I'm so (caught up)
Got me feeling it (caught up)
I'm losing control
This girl's got a hold
I'm so (caught up)
Really feeling it (caught up)
I don't know what it is
But it seems she's got me twisted
I'm so (caught up)
Really feeling it (caught up)
I'm losing control
This girl's got a hold on me

[Bridge]
This girl was mean, she really turned me out
My homies say this girl is cramping my style
And now...

I'm so (caught up)
I'm feeling it (caught up)
I don't know what it is
But it seems she's got me twisted
I'm so (caught up)

This girl's got a hold
I'm so (caught up)
I'm so (caught up)

[Chorus: Cutty]
What it is ho, what's up
Can a nigga get in them guts
Cut you up like you ain't been cut
Show your ass how to really catch a nut
Well give me you number and I'll call
And I'll follow that ass in the mall
Take you home, let you juggle my balls
While I'm beating and tearing down your walls

[Verse 1: Dirty Mouth]
This your boy Mr. Funkadelic, what's the business baby
I've been eyeing you all day in the mall miss lady
You looking good, I think I seen your ass in the hood
With your friends dressed up, trying to front if you could
But anyway, gone and drop a number or something
So I can call you later on,on your phone or something
Take you home, and maybe we could bone or something
It's no limits to what we do, cause tonight we cutting, gut busting
I'm digging in your walls something viscious
With your legs to the ceiling, catch a nut someting serious
You delirious, or might I say you taste so delicious
With your pretty brown skin, like almond joys and kisses
And you ah certified head doctor
Number one staller that takes dick in the ass and won't holler
Bend you over and I""ll follow you straight to the room
Where it goes down lovely in the Legion of Doom

[Chorus: Cutty]
What it is ho, what's up
Can a nigga get in them guts
Cut you up like you ain't been cut
Show your ass how to really catch a nut
Well give me you number and I'll call
And I'll follow that ass in the mall
Take you home, let you juggle my balls
While I'm beating and tearing down your walls

[Verse 2: Lil LA]
Shit, you know the deal before a nigga even stepped
Damn that ass hot, seems like it's gone melt
You know I give it to you til you run out of breath
Then bust a nut all over yourself
The first time I called, you were juggling on my balls
In and out of your jaws, I was beating down your walls
Had your ass breaking laws for a player was the cause
And every time you seen a G you was slipping off your drawers, I recall
I met your ass at the mall, in the fall
You the one with the dress on, let me take you home
Show your ass how to buss a nut, up in the guts
Cut you up like you ain't been cut
From the back then to the side to the front
Turn around,you got me right
I smack them thighs, anyway that you want me
So gone see about a pimp and that monkey
And that's fo' sho'

[Chorus: Cutty]
What it is ho, what's up
Can a nigga get in them guts
Cut you up like you ain't been cut
Show your ass how to really catch a nut
Well give me you number and I'll call
And I'll follow that ass in the mall
Take you home, let you juggle my balls
While I'm beating and tearing down your walls

[Verse 3]
What's the buiseness baby, can I get in them drawes
I like the way your hands rub against my balls
Cause you the one, a nigga met at south dekalb mall
With your pretty brown skin, thick thighs and all
135 petite, and your smell is unique
Maybe we can exchange numbers and hook up in the week
Oh, You a freak, I knew it from the first time I saw you
The way you played with your tongue, I knew right then I would call you
So what it is, they call me Super Don from the ville
And I'mma tell you like this, cause a nigga so real, and stay trill
Cause all I wanna do is just drill, with that ass in the air, and the pussy I kill
And I feel, you love to fuck up on a hill
Suck dick from behind, and take nut in your grill
So bitch chill, and shut your mouth just for a second
While I lay this dick down on you just like I'm Teddy

[Chorus: Cutty]
What it is ho, what's up
Can a nigga get in them guts
Cut you up like you ain't been cut
Show your ass how to really catch a nut
Well give me you number and I'll call
And I'll follow that ass in the mall
Take you home, let you juggle my balls

And the looks decent wagon didn't pass me by
There ain't nothin in my past that I'm tryin hard to hide
And I don't understand why I gotta wonder why

But all I did was break her eggs and bruise her artichoke hearts

Like do or die, I'm po' pimpin'
Car stop, rims keep spinnin'
I'm flippin' drop with invisible tops
Hoes bop when my drop step out
I'm shakin' the block with four eighteens
Candy green with eleven screens
My gasoline always supreme
Got dirt on the brim with a pint of lean
It takes grindin' to be a king, it takes grindin' to be a king
First Round Draft Picks comin', Who is Mike Jones comin'
Slab shinin' with the grill and woman
Slab shinin' with the grill and woman
I'm Mike Jones, (Who?) Mike Jones
The one and only, you can't clone me
Got a lot of haters and a lot of homies, some friends and some phony

[Bridge: Mike Jones]
Back then ho's didn't want me, now I'm hot ho's all on me
Back then ho's didn't want me, now I'm hot ho's all on me
Back then ho's didn't want me, now I'm hot ho's all on me (I said!)
Back then ho's didn't want me, now I'm hot ho's all on me

[Chorus]
Still tippin' on fo' fo's wrapped in fo' vogues
Tippin' on fo' fo's wrapped in fo' vogues
Tippin' on fo' fo's wrapped in fo' vogues
Pimpin' fo' hoes and I'm packin' fo' fo's
Still tippin' on fo' fo's wrapped in fo' vogues
Tippin' on fo' fo's wrapped in fo' vogues
Tippin' on fo' fo's wrapped in fo' vogues
Pimpin' fo' hoes and I'm packin' fo' fo's

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
What it do? It's Paul Wall, I'm the People's Champ
My chain light up like a lamp 'cause now I'm back with the camp
I'm crawlin' similar to an ant, 'cause I'm low to the Earth
People's feelings get hurt, when they figure out what I'm worth
I got eighty fo's pokin' out, at the club I'm showin' out
I'm a player, ain't no doubt, hoes want to know what I'm 'bout
Biggest diamonds off in my mouth, princess cuts all in my chain
Wood grain all in my range, drippin' stains when I switch lanes
Switched the name, it's still the same, SwishaHouse or SwishaBlast
Mike Jones, he runnin' the game and Magnificent 'bout his cash
Michael Watts, he made me hot, hard work took me to the top
G. Dash took me to the lot, he wrote a check and bought a drop
I got the internet goin' nuts but T. Farris got my back, so now I'm holdin' my nuts
It's Paul Wall baby, what you know 'bout me?
I'm on that five nine Southlea, baby, holler at me

[Chorus]
Still tippin' on fo' fo's wrapped in fo' vogues
Tippin' on fo' fo's wrapped in fo' vogues
Tippin' on fo' fo's wrapped in fo' vogues
Pimpin' fo' hoes and I'm packin' fo' fo's
Still tippin' on fo' fo's wrapped in fo' vogues
Tippin' on fo' fo's wrapped in fo' vogues
Tippin' on fo' fo's wrapped in fo' vogues

281,281,Truth Is,"[Verse 1]
Ran into an old friend yesterday
Caught me by surprise when he called my name
He was a familiar face
From a chapter in my past
Talked for a while
Asked him how it's been
Said that he was seeing somebody and
Told me this was gonna last
Showing me her photograph

[Hook]
And all the feelings that I thought were gone
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself

[Chorus]
(Truth is)
I never got over you
(Truth is)
Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is)
And when it's all said and done
Guess I’m still in love with you
(Truth is)
I never should have let you go
(Truth is)
And it's killing me cuz now I know
(Truth is)
And when it's all said and done
Guess I’m still in love with you

[Verse 2]
We reminisce on the way things used to be
Shared a couple laughs, shared some memories
Talked about the things that changed
Some for good and some for bad
Then he said good-bye
And he paid for lunch
Promised that we'd always keep in touch
Grabbed my bags and grabbed my thoughts
Walked away and that was that

[Hook]
And all the feelings that I thought were gone
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself

[Chorus]
(Truth is)
I never got over you
(Truth is)
Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is)
And when it's all said and done
Guess I’m still in love with you
(Truth is)
I never should have let you go
(Truth is)
And it's killing me cuz now I know
(Truth is)
And when it's all said and done
Guess I’m still in love with you

[Bridge]
Now the truth is it hurts
But I know that the fault is mine
‘Cuz I let him go
Tried to get over it
But it's messin' with my mind
(Because I know)

[Repeat Chorus (2x)]
[Chorus]
(Truth is)
I never got over you
(Truth is)
Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is)
And when it's all said and done
Guess I’m still in love with you
(Truth is)
I never should have let you go
(Truth is)
And it's killing me cuz now I know
(Truth is)
And when it's all said and done
Guess I’m still in love with you
(Truth is)
I never got over you
(Truth is)
Wish I was standing in her shoes
(Truth is)
And when it's all said and done
Guess I’m still in love with you
(Truth is)
I never should have let you go
(Truth is)
And it's killing me cuz now I know
(Truth is)
And when it's all said and done
Guess I’m still in love with you

[Outro]

I'mma tell y'all sucka ass niggas somethin'..
First of all nigga, look'a here dawg..

[Hook]
You mighta seen me in the streets but nigga, you don't know me
When you holla when you speak, remember you don't know me
Save all the hatin' and the plottin', nigga you don't know me
Quit tellin' niggas you my partna, nigga you don't know me
Don't be a groupie, keep it movin', nigga you don't know me
Hey I ain't trippin' pimp, the truth is really, you don't know me
Yeah, you know they call me T.I., but you don't know me
You be hatin' and I see why, cuz you don't know me

[Verse 1]
I think it's time I made a song for niggas who don't know me
I graduated out the streets, I'mma real O.G
I been trappin', shootin' pistols since I stood four feet
So all you niggas actin' bad, you gon have to show me
You gon make me bring this Chevy to a real slow creep
My niggas hangin' out the window, mouth fulla gold teeth
When the guns start poppin' wonder when it's gone cease
Chopper hit you in' the side an' create a slow leak
We can end the speculation cuz today we gone see
What's the future of a pussy nigga hatin' on me
I give a fuck about the FED's investigation on me
I don't care that they at my shows and they waitin' on me
I'mma keep on flossin', poppin' long as Toomp is on the beat
Tell police's I ain't stoppin', I'mma keep it in the streets
Contrary to yo beliefs, I'm as real as you can be
Fuck yo thoughts and yo feelings, nigga you don't know me

[Hook]
You mighta seen me in the streets but nigga, you don't know me

[Verse 2]
Ay, once again let me remind you nigga, you don't know me
So don't be walkin' up and askin' what's the deal on a key
I don't know if you wearin' wires, you could be the police
If I was slangin' blow you couldn't get a O-Z
See me and the P.$.C. fallin' through at a show deep
Police holdin' up the door, cuz they know we tote heat
I just wanna ride wit C, blow dro' in the Fleet
Or with Clay and bout a dozen different bitches in a week
I just wanna chill wit Kuntry and his daddy Freddie G
Ballin' out at anytime, in any store we spend a G
Wanna ball in the Bahamas, courtesy of K.T
Mac Boney got a mil, as well as Dolla D.P
A.K. house on the hill right next to J.G
Every week meet at Philant's restaurant and eat free
Get Inda paid, lil' Greg and B
That's the only shot we got at gettin' cap back on the streets

[Hook]

Woah, let me tell you girl

Time and time again
That they would rock your world
And change your life
But I can’t blame them
Cause you make a nigga wanna get involved
Wanna get the drawers
Well I’m gone put my bid in
And get at you
No disrespect but I want it bad as they do
The only difference is
They look out for themselves
But I’m doin’ it just to hear you yell, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh
That’s gonna be the sound
Girl when it’s goin’ down

Oh, In the night
You sayin’ Oh means

Girl come on over and
Let’s get this thing crackin’
You’ll be surprised when

Tryna get hot and heavy
Turn you out if you let me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl I’m gone take you
Somewhere that never been
Show you some things that'll
Make you wanna show your friends
Have you so weak that you
Can’t even say a thing
But that’s okay all you gotta say

[Chorus]
Oh

And go at in again
Girl I work my way from A
All the way to Z
But trust me baby girl
O is where you wanna be
Couldn’t believe me when I tell you
I’m not tryna tell you what to do
Cause when it’s said and done
The choice ain’t mine it’s really up to you
Just say yes don’t fix your mouth to tell me no
Drop that bottom
Jaw for me and just say Oh

[Chorus]
Oh
That’s gonna be the sound
Girl when it’s goin’ down
Your body sayin’

Girl I’m just glad you came
So you can say

Now somebody say my name
Let me hear you say

Let me hear you say
Oh, when you can’t make another sound

285,285,She's No You,"[Verse 1]
They got a lotta girls who know they got it going on
But nothing's ever a comparison to you
Now can't you see that you're the only one I really want?
And everything I need is everything you do

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Any girl walk by, don't matter cause your looking so much better
Don't ever need to get caught up in jealousy
She could be a super-model every magazine, the cover
She'll never, ever mean a thing to me

[Chorus]
She's no you (Oh no)
You give me more than I could ever want
She's no you
I'm satisfied with the one I've got
'Cause you're all the girl that I've ever dreamed
She's only a picture on a magazine
She's no you, she's no you

[Verse 2]
They got a lot of girls who dance in all the videos
But I prefer the way you do, the way you move
You're more than beautiful and I just wanna let you know
That all I ever need is what I've got with you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Any girl walk by, don't matter every time your looking better
I think your perfect, there ain't nothing I would change
She could be a super-model every magazine, the cover
She'll never, ever take my heart away

[Chorus]
She's no you (Oh no)
You give me more than I could ever want
She's no you
I'm satisfied with the one I've got
'Cause you're all the girl that I've ever dreamed
She's only a picture on a magazine
She's no you, she's no you

[Bridge]
No one's ever gonna get to me
Oh, the way you do, now baby can't you see
That you're the one, the only one
Who's ever made me feel this way?
Nothing's ever coming even close, no
No one's ever been comparable to you

[Breakdown]
I don't want nothin' I don't got
I don't need nothin' but you
I can't get more than you're given me
Don't stop anything you do
You're all that, all that and then some
You know what, just what I need
And no girl, no place and nowhere
Would mean a thing to me

[Chorus]
She's no you (Oh no)
You give me more than I could ever want
She's no you
I'm satisfied with the one I've got
Cause you're all the girl that I've ever dreamed
She's only a picture on a magazine
She's no you, she's no you
She's no you (Oh no)
You give me more than I could ever want
She's no you
I'm satisfied with the one I've got
'Cause you're all the girl that I've ever dreamed
She's only a picture on a magazine

286,286,When You Tell Me That You Love Me,"[Round 1: Loaded Lux]
Peace King Disrespectful
But shit talkin' don't make you no dope rapper
Now, now, now yeah we know you done got you some stature
I can see that, we opened the books, now I'll be closin' the chapter
When you send 'em to the front line but they get it backwards
I'm not like most is (Moses), cause if you ain't read (Red) I can still split a C (sea) apart
When the snake don't turn and stick with the staffers
What's a stature to the rapture?
A ratchet nigga gettin' fixed, this a fracture
I was a Panther I did the pastor
I wouldn't know, beatin' everythin' sin say (sensei) don't make you no master
This what he after?
Initially casin' me on the low
Now he got some capital you think you the alpha, bet
But you owe mega (Omega) and the house come to collect
You know it's about respect
This eighth, he started out hangin' with a- well I got news (noose) for him it's goin' out on his neck
And it's goin' out on the net nigga
When a favor turn into a charity bout to the death
Aye Jersey, y'all only support him cause y'all gotta
Him and Ray, Charles, they don't see y'all when they got them bands and they movin'
Whole 24/7, it ain't one shot of y'all, not a land in the viewin'
I could see it be for protection, look how random the crew is
And he went truant, ain't even true what he draw the van with the students
Sayin' what you're soupin', when a nigga souped up..til the Sandman gotta swoop in
He hoopin' but the man need improvement
I go interiors where they decorate him and get the Raymour & Flanigan movin'
You standin' here stupid
All this Hollywood chicken you get
Back to the hood lookin' like he can't dance to the music
Roscoe Jenkins in here actin' like he too good for the family reunion
Handsome what is ya doin'?
Your movements look fear based like that time [?] had you rappin' in back of the staircase
Yet you was scared straight nigga
All day and you couldn't even wish me a happy Father's Day?
I swear you show your love in a weird way
Instead you gon' be up here talkin' 'bout my work, ya showin' off for ya friends
You didn't have to sneak me into Career Day
Why they can't ever rap at me straight, you know?
They gon' come up here personals, angles and jokes
They gotta force they names into the conversation of GOAT
We'll go wit it
I rap, I touch my nostrils, they sayin' it's coke
Or maybe it's dope
Cause every time I'm in a Smack lineup they nose, I crack his head, come get this smoke nigga
Can you smell the incense?
Aww baby, the Asiatic black man's back hand, back healin' business
What is this?
I imagine you think that's why I booked this Kung-Fu Kenny look
Not at all
This just cause I came to cook my dawg (dog)
No offense, but will he (Wile E) Coyote Ugly a friend?
Bar shots Above The Rim
2Pac, Birdie roll, run and go stop when he meet me (meep meep) I got to drop
And I'm goin' loonie (Looney) wit it, nigga Tune in
You 'bout to get tuned up a bit
Construction kit
They was pumpin' you gas, guzzlin' like diesel, you fit to be truckin' in
That's car troublin', drive strugglin'
Look what happens when you tryin' to line up your connect and the Wi-Fi bufferin'
Y'all sufferin'
The divine spark back thunderin'
[?] watch (Watts) happenin' to his functionin'
I mean with this little punk ass Pay-Per-View charge that I'm up against
You can't be a live wire, still dyin' in ya hood on ya cable
They gettin' stuck again
Oh cause (cuz) you thought you was set when they jumped you in
Monkey wrench, this is battery
I got to sock it (socket) to him on his own outlet, let me plug him in
Dead China man in the trunk, tuck a Chin nigga
Or risk (wrist) watchin' and get clocked work when I'm punchin' in
Let's rumble then
Once again you here, lucky him
Fuckin' when I can't trust this since he made it us and them
Aye Harlem you know everyday they be hustlin'
Then Raw say, ""Don't forget about lil' bruh and them.""
So I treat it like the man a kin to me (mannequin)
But you really a doll baby
Chucky for a friend will back stab you after you cut him in
You can tailor made, look where his money went
For me to custom whip it up for him to let him model it
Bitch nigga ya not followin'
You ain't hip to it?
That's when I'ma come around
And waste (waist) him with the belt on the line, that'll buckle him
You chucklin'?
Ars, run your lips, with your voice up
All boisterous
Little boy stuff
What he on
But bars? Every time I hear yours they be off
Ars!
So maybe you should already be gone
What you lost nigga?
""I kick your mother down the steps, ah shot your daughter around her neck
Hit her with Spongebob clarinet""
We talkin' BARS? Or Ars'?!
""I'll kill ya dead daddy twice, bring him back to life
Fuck ya mother in his casket, have Lux bring it."" Nice
But we talkin' Bars? Or Ars'?
Let me escort ya
If I got to give you this food for thought through a feedin' tube
I bet he remember who taught ya (torture)
Aye, this one gon' be a scorcher
This Miyagi drawin' down on Daniel-san block
I could've worked with you on your jump shot
He went another route, I'm comin' out
These bars, beatin' him like a drunk pops
You a Blood and you trust cops
Ya fake ass probably got butt shots nigga
You can't say nothin' about a Harlem nigga snitchin'
While you out here tellin' niggas business you do business wit
Oh ya girly, this what he picked up on his travels, huh Jersey?
You all over the place baby
So what nigga? I'm other worldly
In other words, I'll whirl him into a hole, now that's cold
But I want him to feel the shakes when I'm comin', Big Shirley
Nigga seriously
Aye this nigga couldn't tell a vision (television) til I first show up
That's pilotin'
King Roscoe, ya culture roach
He buggin' in here tryin' to wing it wit me
Don't get fly for them
You old camp food nigga
Who kept the fire lit?
I'm the embodiment of body strength
And I've got it by the length, width, how to get it outta limits, I can send it
You're now present with the cosmic gift
Fuck your accomplishments
And all these niggas who sponsored it
The monitors
Now watchin' it
Pure consciousness vs common sense
I'm confident
I can't tell your conscious that I'm your consequence
It's cognitive
And yours ain't at a level that comprehend
I forbid
These sciences, I train wit inside the gym
I put pain in, you can't trade shade with a shot of Jim
That's blindin' him
He caught the fade whenever got a glimpse of the lights
The way they hit the ring loud it's no bell (Nobel)
But everything I pull it surprisin' (Pulitzer Prize) him
I am him
This is new work and it ain't friendly
But I know every time y'all [?] it ain't me
But y'all treat me like royalty, look how they feed Grapes to the king
Where's the loyalty?

Arsonal versus Loaded fuckin' Lux on UDubb Network
You really got played
And if you say some shit that I don't like by the third round all them gon' know how much you really got paid
Now Hov tweeted yo' slogan nigga
Farrakhan brought your name up
But you was in that same project buildin' in Harlem bein' the same Lux
You standin' on my stage right now preachin' the same stuff
Man he said it, Andy Pettitte couldn't teach him to change up
They said they want that gray sweatshirt Loaded
They need Lux to be A Boogie
But must I remind y'all Trayvon died in that same gray hoodie
I know you nigga, and Brother Polite been talkin' to you too politely
Fuckin' yo' mind up
You went from mean to this nigga Beloved, I'm tryin' to find Lux
Not the preacher, not Rich Porter or the Black Panther versus Da Don Lux
I'm lookin' for that lil' cold hearted nigga that used to watch his step daddy fuckin' his mom up
Yeah that's right, this nigga mother was a punchin' bag
And them nights daddy came home on that drunken swag
He was standin' in the doorway already cryin' cause he knew he was finna do somethin' bad
He figured if he left you alone you'll heal on your own, he treated you like a fuckin' scab
Now you had to watch yo' mother side nigga beat her fuckin' ass like he yo' fuckin' dad
But that's the lil' nigga I need to address
Project yo' voice, let it stream from yo' chest
Yo baby mother fuckin' V12 and that's what's keepin' you stressed
You treat life like a game of chess, but yo' queen keep bein' Fresh
Honestly king, that's why your opponents always keep you in check
Cause of your mate
Y'all just caught that, some of ya late
I said Lux, we from the era where niggas had Nintendo beef
We was in those streets, supplied the snorters, but you was with those creeps
Lionz Den, December of '08, didn't you sniff those weeks?
But when his nose bleed he get upset, nigga you picked those seats
All you did was learned the game of chess, read some books nigga and flipped yo' speech
Extendo's speak, you gotta be tougher than Kimbo cheek
You won't get no sleep
We watched yo' career take off, go through the clouds and then crash, I told you about those window seats
Man listen, you see me out here tryin' to transition
You on a gram dissin'
You throwin' punches but my shit's land different
You shootin' but my piece is hittin'
Nigga we scam different
You an important factor but you never left yo' hood, you just the transmission
And you do this shit for the dead presidents, so let's talk Dead Presidents
The movie, I ain't talkin' money now
Yo' daddy was Anthony, your mother like that bitch Juanita, she just kept bringin' Cutty 'round
You thought yo' daddy was some fly nigga til that side nigga start throwin' money 'round
And it's funny, that it's like deja vu cause yo' son ain't even-
You know what? It's funny how you don't post no pictures of that little motherfucker
And I find that to be a bad thing
So I did some research and I found out yo' baby moms was in the fast lane
But you was so excited to be a father and do the dad thing
That you overlooked the paternity test you failed and you out here callin' this lil' nigga yo' son and he don't even got yo' last name?
Fuck is you talkin' 'bout boy? He's a bastard nigga! He's a bastard!
You always talkin' 'bout everybody else pops
But I ain't e'rybody else pop
When they thought he was addicted to Smack, me, I was the nigga who helped Roc
I was the Lion in yo' Den nigga, I was leavin' 'em shell shocked
When yo' pockets came empty nigga I was helpin' yo' sales drop nigga
I was the nigga who came up with the idea Hollow Da Don vs Loaded Lux
I was the nigga who proof read yo' contract once they wrote it up
I was the nigga who started wildin' and then battle rap opened up
My blue collar freestyle was the only verse that woke 'em up
I let the Llama spray
I pull up to where ya mama stay
Like, ""Juanita, your son out here callin' niggas 'handsome' bitch, that's kinda gay.""
Man, I walk in yo' son room and shoot his daddy on Father's Day
Bombs away, Pearl Harbor, any given time of day
What have you loaded Lux?
Pistols you ain't never handled none
You wouldn't know how to hold an AR if I hand you one
These labels don't wanna sign you, where does that energy channel from?
Cause I'm better than you on wax and off wax, 'member I'm Daniel-san
This what happen when you sit Hussein Fatal at 2 Chainz table
I'm Immortal in Kombat, they watchin' Liu Kang slay you
I'm UDubb, where yo' league? None of your troops ain't able
Beloved, you was lyin' then (Lionz Den) now the truth can't save you
Why you ain't never battle in the Lionz Den? Should I ask Sub Zero?
But why you ain't never battle in the Lionz den if you was doin' it for hip hop?
We made yo' shit hot
Me, ICE, Goodz, K-Shine, Clips, Roc
You only get mentioned in yo' era cause you had a good team, bitch stop
But we was helpin' you win, so to a Kobe you just a Rick Fox
Nigga it's funny how the street shit can transition into B-ball
Every man for himself this shit an all out free fall
Fuck my coach and the plays he call
I ain't puttin' my arm down after I shoot; Sanaa Lathan after the 3 ball
So, so, so, so, so, so what do we have here? A nigga dressed like a chink
Who say a lot of nothin' but y'all think he's so smart
A nigga who whole life revolve around chess (chest) but ain't got no heart
A nigga who wouldn't look at a bull's eye but like to throw darts
A nigga who never touched a key in his life but he think he Mozart
So it starts
All the weird hand gestures and the slow remarks
You learned that from your old head in the pool hall who be throwin' darts
But how you plan on beatin' the Million Dollar Man in the ring when you got Owen's Hart (heart)
See, we got bananas for everybody down to the last monkey on Noah's Ark nigga
Man, my shit is real, my shit is raw, my shit is authentic
And you can't spell ""bars"" without puttin' that ""Ars'"" in it

[Round 2: Loaded Lux]
I said bars or Ars'?
Previous little gang members who don't put in no pain
Aye cuz, what's crackin' other than the egg in the skillet you fried mornings?
Side talkin', he got 100 pistols in your videos, it's silly though
Cause you ain't gon' lay down nothin' on a track but a rhyme for us
Why force it? I keep it tall I'ma always have size on ya
That's why your kind descending (condescending) like tellin' Fetty Wap, ""Aye! You ain't the only one keepin' on him."" Nigga I'm on 'em
He can sell you a script, but when a dead man talkin' it's usually Tales From The Crypt
First the Dot Mobb break up, now everyday I wake up, somebody out here breakin' the code
What's all the fuckin' fussin' fo', huh Ars'?
Cause I opened up a door?
To the kitchen? And I still pops up cookin' for you, but son let's keep it raw
You hot cause you called out the kettle, blackin' on you cause this pot got you steamed?
Well keep it on the stove like the oven door, you wasn't sure
Clips ain't the gamblin' man, no it's Ars'
You know I told the queen my old ace jack gonna come at the king
She go, ""Well what's the odds?
That he can cut it?"" Cause it's money on deck, don't mean you can flip it, look at how he turn the card
Yeah y'all, Hollow should've been thy name, oh my God
She said, ""I think he got the wrong bookin'."" I said, ""Shit that's Allah
Cause he still gon' get this church with the Koran."" Oh my gosh
He want no mas, smoke wit me
Tell your general who the surgeon warns
These worship wars, I do religiously nigga, on ya lawn
Convert ya lord, earth to niggas who can't see the serpents horns
In certain forms
But whether (weather) man like my reign (rain) or not, I learnt (alert) the storm
And I turnt him on, to ways I earned along with ways I birthed 'em all, my word is bond
In perfect poems, research the log nigga
This punk ass league ain't nothin' but a drop of ink off the blueprints I was workin' on
You ain't make the resurgence strong nigga
This shit? Look nigga I kinged you in a shop
I took Surf from a pawn, that got Suge'r shot
Oh (O) you ain't read (Red)? Nigga you was in the mix just gettin' taped
He ain't even have a Clue, I was makin' this sport Fabolous puttin' Jersey on nigga
That didn't even need a punch wit it
He know he mine
That's why you can't even spell your name without puttin' that ""son"" in it nigga
I feel sorry for your daughter
I gotta go in here and rock a kid Foundation cause you Make A Wish
Yeah daddy goin' down like a shaky pimp
Then they raised the rent
Til they convinced, ""He can't see the light"" but he think he lit
When bankin' on chasin' chips how ya lost on a Vegas strip
They shaved the rent, then they repent
You better change your pitch
When you see these (CD) players, start blankin' for the record
This don't come with laser print
Make 'em quit
Now Ars', normally wouldn't tell you it's the thang to quit
But when you ain't win ya last...maybe ten
I don't know, Swag, you more of a business partner than I can say a friend
So tell me the bag was for extra pay and it was fixed
You know what I mean? Uh, how else you explain it then?
You jumpin' 'round makin' grins
With that fake pretend facial cringe like that shit he's sayin' slick
He ain't sip, you know I know Ars', I'm takin' tips
To make attempts on an American Idol's life
Play Dough, it ain't gon' feel like Clay when it ache and (Aiken) shit
But it ain't your shift
Cause you ain't commit baby your Will power like Jayden Smith vs Jadakiss
And them flat lines, they gon get you aired out
These ain't the re-tirements Mako fix, this may go quick
You like cars, right Ars'?
Hold up, that got your name in it
Well let's take a lift, or should I say a Lyft cause whatever you whipped up I'm fender bender break ya shit
You basic bitch
Who you in here basin' with?
I told Calicoe, it ain't about how many fights you had, it's who ya fought
But what's the difference between him and my apprentice?
You on a 24/7 with slo-mo shots that you gettin' sexy with a pool full of niggas
Or should I say, skinny dippin' wit six bitches
No we not judgin', aye Loc, you so crazy
I can see you now, Martin voice high with your man in the hotel lobby
The way the water was glistenin' all over your body
Dreadful
I said, my nigga, you knows how I craft this shit
It's craftsmanship
This where practice get, classic bitch
You're an embarrassment
Fuckin' savage to the sport that I married in
I horse niggas that how I carried it
Arrogant, fuck what you averagin', I'll shatter it
I mastered it, pure passionate
Ask him if he think it a mistake when I say I'ma show him how much of his face is accident
Don't assume you got access
If I gotta knock you into another world nigga, you better come off an axis
I go into a city and turn new revenue into rappers
You ain't payin' me nigga you payin' taxes
Look I love you, but you can't be in here like you Andre The Giant off the turnbuckle and don't rumble
You say to money, ""Whoopi! Well Sister you gotta Act.""
You can't pound this, [?] gun so big it need about three duffles
And then you get into real trouble and start blowin' the hustle
You and G Mayne Frost got into a shovin' match and you didn't go get the shovel
Now I don't got a lot of questions, well maybe a couple
Now in the footage you go, ""Eh, don't do that."" Then he did that
And then somewhere in there we lose you in the scuffle
Now what I wanna know is, was you fast or was you furious nigga?
Cause they out here sayin' you flew the coop like Vin Diesel stunt double, nigga
Talk to me baby, talk to me
The way you in here fail it ain't fair
I swear if you see me and a bear fight, don't worry about me, help the bear
You'se a waste of my motherfuckin' time nigga
And you're cuttin' into your mother's fuckin' time nigga

[Round 2: Arsonal]
Fastest way to Harlem is the A right? That's what you say, right?
These theatrical performances is why they pay right?
But you're copyin' all your antics off a weirdo, that's how you play, right?
Shit, nigga you should've came dressed as a vampire, we all know you afraid of daylight (Daylyt)
But let's get off that
Y'all want me to prove it? Let's talks facts
Don't be afraid to talk dirty my nigga I talk back
You should wanna be a better father to yo' son nigga
Look how Khalid handle a side now
The bitch raisin' yo' son got a felony that's why his mother ain't got a job now
She got caught, cause it was another nigga behind the wheel cause his daddy ain't want to drive now
She bust the checks, you supposed to maneuver the V, Bonnie & Clyde style
What you gon' tell yo' son nigga
How his son was robbin' Peter to pay Paul?
Or make up some all American story about how she competed and played ball
Was weeded since yay tall, succeeded and stay hard
Or is you gon' tell him how you B. Dot, Daylyt and King Los all worship the same fraud?
Is you gon' keep it real wit him? Or say some shit to dismiss him so you ain't gotta deal wit him?
You ain't gon' be happy until a nigga like [?] decide to chill wit him
But you try to paint the large picture and prove Cal' pops was some lost nigga
No field nigga, house nigga, boss nigga we all niggas
You just auctioning off your soul, tryin' to sell it so you get on quicker
Brother Polite don't equal no god nigga
You said you used to battle off the roof and the loser had to jump
Man it look to me like you battlin' fo' yo' life
You lookin' more and more like Pookie every month
But see I know you Lux, and I listen to the sermons different
Oh I know about all your surgeon visits
And according to Harlem hospital, Usher ain't the only nigga out here that was burnin' bitches
Three shots up in his ceilin', listen my words is different
I said three shots of penicillin, he on his third prescription
Oh his nerves is twitchin', Donald Trump mask, the Purge against him
This point will end ya quick, Derek Rose edition
I'ma get 'em all to look in yo' hood, I got a service engine
No extension, it's sawed off, it had a circumcision
You think these crackers gon' keep it real wit ya?
All this righteous shit, bullets still hit ya
Oh you think cause you rock a lil' bit of Tommy Hilfiger
Society want to deal witcha
Man, you out here tryin' to break yo' people down
Man, we don't cry over no spilled liquor
I need you to look in the mirror at 4:44 and tell me what you see John...still nigga
Don't matter what you grow up to be John, still nigga
You ain't pullin' that Calicoe shit on me John, how it feel nigga?
I'll reach for that iron then clap it, y'all gon' see Ars' spit wit a Tech 9 in front of Lux
It's gon' remind you of that Lionz Den classic
Mask on, windows up while the tires spin backwards
I shoot with one arm out, chin down, that's a violin tactic
I said Newark my birthplace, preacher man, you better button up your shirt straight
My nina ain't just to bust, lil Spanish thot on the first date
They ask me, ""Ars', why you keep rappin' 'bout guns in yo' battles?""
Cause it's hammers in my work place
And this the nigga that put the Tech 9 in front of me in the first place
So I guess I gotta expose the fact that you a fiend
Since you won't admit yourself
Four years ago you said, ""Harlem hospital givin' beds out.""
But you still didn't admit yourself
You'd rather risk your health then to go get some help?
Mama say get yo' belt
You was out here servin' fiends, now you in here takin' hits yourself
You supposed to be a king nigga, you goin' against yo' team
You in this yourself, tonight you alone my nigga
Fuck V12, you in this yourself
You know the difference between me and you?
You fake and you soft
I've been doin' you free favors my whole career and I'm still breakin' you off
It don't matter how much this card cost
I can break even or be takin' a loss
As long as I give these fans what they desire, that's what make me the boss
Vs Hollow you said, ""I need 40 shorty"" and I made that happen, right?
For just you
My word is my bond, I live by that code, that's what I stuck to
But now ya back and you're back workin' for me
So now it's, ""Fuck you""
Cause I'm the lil' brother my big brother been lookin' up to
I was drivin' that school bus for a livin' nigga
You thought I was havin' fun on it?
Well I ain't enjoy my days til I pulled up to that buildin' in Harlem and you put yo' son on it
Nine in the percussion family, his baby brother got a drum on it
It's automatic it spits so quick if I remix it I'm puttin' Pun on it
Nigga you threw me in the ring Lux, you ain't teach me to rhyme
Bitch nigga, I saw you runnin' from Iron Sheik in his prime
I let you speak to a nine
Head shot, doctor will be tellin' yo' mother that a Hollow clearly beat you this time
What ch'all thought? I was gonna respect you?
Like you was somethin' special?
I'll walk into yo' church and slap the shit outta whoever you sittin' next to
Nigga, yo' son's sand castle, that's what I step through
Snoop in Baby Boy, ""I hate you too little nigga. You ain't my son.""
I don't even treat him like my nephew!
I was a different dude, always abided by them different rules
I was taught, ""Squeeze questions, leave questions way after you ditch the tool.""
Robberies on different dudes
I was on the move with sticks before I learned to stick and move
Nigga, you ain't droppin' wisdom fool
You a false prophet, tryin' to profit off those with lost priorities
It's all logic the plug has to be involved, they all sockets
If you wanna enlighten and bitin' when writin' get off topic
You must switch the subject to fully school a nigga, boy stop it
You ain't took Math yet, you still walkin' through these halls boppin'
You ain't battle nobody from the English decent, your card's droppin'
You out here spittin' science fiction predictions while Lord's watchin'
[?] leave you cut out for these punches; Bernard Hopkins
I was in Manhattan for the day, I'm mackin' wit your bae
(Oh they talkin' while I'm rappin'...LOOK AT ME KING!)
I was in Manhattan for the day, I'm mackin' wit your bae
Pickin' her brains, I'm tryin' to figure out the address where you stay
I get to clappin' with the K, head shots, they gon' be missin' you dearly Beloved
Bow y'all heads, we are gathered here today
Whole neighborhood had your back son if you was cool
You had a whole bunch of strangers ridin' witchu like an Uber pool
But nobody in yo' inner circle thought you was cool
Y'all just a whole bunch of squares that finally came together and formed the Rubix Cube
I said, if you want wreck in this motherfuckin' ring
Get tangled, I'm well rounded
Man, all them stupid ass Chinese man angles don't work on a nigga that's well rounded
My shit is real, I wish V12 would shut the fuck up
John, your lucks up nigga

[Round 3: Loaded Lux]
I'm back to make the UDubb ultimate again
Yeah, yeah they done turned this sucker shit into a lick
Let get 'em shakin' in they shoes
My tongue will take you to the groove
Look at 'em, they waitin' on a move
Cause I ain't here playin' by the rules and it's makin' 'em confused
Ain't the bus driver 'pose to be takin' niggas to school?
It feels like vibes changin' in the room ya know
(Stop pickin' on him!)
I told him, ""Just pick a forum"", that's destiny I can't pick it for him
But I'ma kick through the picket fences
I'ma pop on his grandpops, I'll blame it on ya old head
He got you out here like it's green grass, blue skies when it's code red
And O-Red who you should hand it to nigga
Ya show dead but ya gon' [?]
Ars' fans, don't give up on holmes yet
You go there and you vote for him
Cause y'all the reason this nigga came in here and broke a leg, both of 'em
His road runnin' out of lane
I'm ashamed ya got a name on my platform
Endin' up this kind of lame, it's not the same
The nigga comin' to Blackout at events and ya fallin' off the stage
And ya keep comin' back out here again
Like we don't see you fallin' off and it ain't staged
And nigga you gonna back up like this?
God d- this worse than the time Trick Trick was movin' forward to the stage, nigga
I'm just sayin', they lookin' forward to his grave
You 'bout to end up dressed up like the roles Martin played, it's all the same
I'll explain
When the Grapes viewin' you at Big Momma's House but they got to hear mama pain
I'm just sayin', nigga
Is you really in retirement though? Is that actually a fact?
How you gon' stop battlin' for a rap career and you battlin' wit that?
I mean I heard ya shit nigga
Really? Rap songs?
I'd rather hear House Party back on
The way I was skippin' through the records like Chill bumpin' the table while Bilal gettin' his scratch on
I'd rather put a track on for an hour straight of a hacksaw scrapin' a blackboard
I'm choppin' it up about you brickin'
Breakin' it down right in front of you and I got a class full
That's what you ask for
Daniel-san, I could try to clean it up but you know damn well
As soon as I put that wax on it was wax off
That's what you asked for
You should've bought some time
Paid attention, you'll live a richer life
Stop toyin' with learnin'
Don't play school if it's your (Fischer) Price
You know I'm a teacher that don't need tenure, right
You know I don't wanna see lil' Kali endin' up like a Jenner, right?
Didn't mean to offend ya twice
I'm in here just strikin', I'm a master
They want Bison to punch lightening
I'm mic'd in for the kid in the slums fightin'
He just want a bottle, Cus D'amato, I'm a young Tyson
I get to ambushin' with ambition, kickin' these handwrittens
Minus the man mittens
Ars', you was takin' random leave for family need
2013 you called me out against K-Shine
Stage 48 was the scene
Now it's first 48 on the screen
You that same punk kid usin' this gang shit to chase a dream
But it ain't what it seems
Big brother see ya hand, ya Peter Pan
But y'all never land (Neverland) with this make believe
Let's change the speed
The mind is the real threat, build pecs
I pull a chi in with a breath
Ya Chia Pet ya just here (hair)
I know he came to make a movie and I can't Judge Dredd
Might look like a Predator but he Alien to the skill set
You dead if you don't feel that
If dimwitted, I'm tellin' you it's the state of mind he in
Ya slow, I gotta show you what you might've missed
Ya goal ain't got the Midas print
That's my fault though, Lionz Den designer glitch
I'm back chimin' in
I check [?], ya lifespan just...lookin' like some tight spandex with the vagina print
This pussy been pokin' at me
And I'm 'bout to slide inside the grid
Realign the fiber wirin' to find the chip
On my shoulders it's taken toll, Ars' breakin' code, I gotta encrypt shit
Let's modify a bit
You was guided down, Bobby Brown, started out poppin' shit
Ya can't put down that crack no more, well that's your Prerogative
Somethin' gotta give
This a legend vs allegedly, you retirin'
I hope so nigga, yo' shit tirin'
You a novice at bein' clever I promise you that I'm better
I'm positive
Ya boys pay me the coins cause that's the only way off me you gon' get some type of dime in this (dominance)
It's obvious this brother throwin' the season in
Cause I'm hungry
I told him to put that bread together and let us (lettuce) see what tomato give, the Godfather flick
It's contracted killers and silent operatives
He sense swag and a copper friend finna lock me in
So you not the boss, that's just politics and you got a partnership
And all this goin' noodles like you pullin' the strings then we meet boy (meatball) you ain't the source, see (saucy)
Aye that's what bein' impostors (in pasta) get a mobster clip
His posture's stiff
Ars', you makin' music or tryin' to Crip?
Oh you just playin' violent, I see
Well that's instrumental to violins while ya rip, why pretend?
Booby fake, you was gettin' college in (collagen)
But what's a scholarship to the [?]?
That's a power trip
These chakra's lift that shock will shift an organ glitch, call it quits
I bring water (war to) shit, ain't diarrhea that's direist
My die will fit for high intense, you hide intent
I hope viewer discretion advised the kids
Ya now lookin' at a pump fakin' professional goin' against the grain right now
Jersey
Cause home is not a place to be tryin' this
Mind ya biz
Tay Roc you a light attempt
Stand down this mice to men, I ran down
Look nigga, the only thing you could do for battle rap now is mic us in
Jordan back nigga, Mike is in
And I fight to win
So you go out here and find us a finalist
And you tell him I'm in this to be ominous
Keep an eye on me nigga, iron fist
Tighten grip, giant wrist, a might hit
Loyal to death, I'm like a German scientist with the signin' pen
Damn, and I do timed events like a Zionist
He don't know who he rhymin' wit
Man, I will battle anyone on the card with this hand of Jesus nigga
Don't  you ever throw rocks at the sun, you can't reach

[Round 3: Arsonal]
Unlike you I got to pay for all of this
Ya know, this is my final round of battle rap please applaud me
I got to end with a strong finish
You said, ""Hov givin' out niggas a million dollars worth of game for $9.99"", I'm in the wrong business
I heard that, shit, still to this day I ain't let that song finish
I ain't gonna have to go to trial for this body nigga, they all witness
Now is you a Free Mason or a nigga that just be free basin'?
You livin' 2 Fast to be Furious, you see what happened to Paul Walker when he was speed racin'
You dream chasin'
While I'm out here askin' Freddy if he seen Jason
Nigga these nightmares reality nigga, I don't need nathan
I will shoot you in yo' motherfuckin' forehead if you every try to underhand me
And just cause I stood over yo' body to do it nigga don't mean that you don't understand me
Do you understand me?
You got murdered nigga! Not with the Calicoe but the Clip had Hollow's in it
I said Murda Mook, Calicoe, Charlie Clips, Hollow
Isn't it ironic and kinda iconic that at this time and minute
If you define and get it you'll see that an arsenal (Arsonal) contain all of those contents in it
You disguised your image
You manipulated the 5%ers
Started usin', I watched you powered ya face up, tryin' to hide a blemish
You a conscious brother, but your conscious isn't
You'll meet with a shotgun at the line of scrimmage if you don't mind ya business
Tretch told me yo' mother was some skinny bitch who used to be suckin' Vinnie dick behind the benches
Knowin' that yo' father wasn't yo' father but she still had him at them doctor visits
She all kind of vicious
Every nigga in the hood been in her, she a Honda Civic
Callin' my phone for a fix at 5AM, usin' all them Obama minutes
Oh, Grape Street been gettin' money cuz
Your folks was buyin' crack off of my buddies cuz
Losin' weight off that rock I done seen your pop go from Sherman Klump to Buddy Love, nigga
And you followin' in the footsteps of daddy, copyin' what he does
Yo' daddy lookin' at his son seein' a reflection of what he was
So what I know a cop named L? What I'm supposed to feel funny?
If you ain't got an inside man nigga you ain't never made no real money
Come here L, I know when them crackers comin'
I know when them raids comin' and when them crackers tryin' to steal from me
I got a nigga wit a legal firearm that'll drill for me nigga
Nicky Barnes, Frank Lucas, them niggas pocket's stay swole
Bugsy Siegel was lethal and gettin' it by the case load
Even El Chapo payed copo, hella pesos
What I'm tryin' to say is every gangster you ever heard of had a cop on his payroll, nigga
I empty off the clip and then off him with a two piece
So criticizing those I keep close only make you weak
Nigga get yo' facts right before you start markin' on loose leaf
Cause L Wisdom ain't really even a cop he like Martin off Blue Street, nigga
I'm tired of the games he play
You'll end up another sad story on a rainy day
Or then it's back to that shit you was sniffin' to take the pain away
Don't end up like the Russians did Lonzo endin' of Training Day
This shit here like Jumanji, a real dangerous game to play
You under Brother Polite, new covenent
Where consciousness meet commerce
Well right now you at Newark Symphony Hall nigga, where your conscious can meet Converse
Y'all wanna know why I'm really retirin' battle rap?
Y'all wanna know?!
It ain't y'all fans or the rappers, it's these niggas, these league niggas
Supposed to be my brothers to help me feed niggas
Organik called my phone and said, ICE can't be on yo' card, I couldn't believe niggas
Cause I just went and did y'all event cause I'm a G nigga
I'm tryin' to figure out, y'all think we wanna steal y'all rappers, what y'all concerned wit?
If one hand was washin' the other we all could learn shit
Smack you my brother but them contracts burn quick
Cause right, you can't copy respect but you can earn it
That's why I wanna know why niggas like DNA got over 100 battles and ain't got a house for his family
That shit ain't addin' up
It's cause punk ass leagues like Lionz Den don't give a fuck about the battler, nigga
As long as you takin' they chump change they ain't mad at ya
You did two battles on my league and I gave you enough money to feed the whole Africa
So don't you ever in yo' motherfuckin' life say I ain't help you feed yo' family nigga
Cause truth is
I put just as much food on yo' son table as you did, nigga
What have you done?
For yo' son...that I ain't do?
I ain't buy him that fool's gold
But I bet you this motherfucker's Alpha N Omega check sponsorin' his school clothes
What have you done, for yo' son, that I ain't do nigga?
I put money in yo' pockets that you couldn't afford 'em
You need to introduce to Uncle Ars', tell him the nigga buyin' him all them joys
What have you done for yo' son that I ain't do nigga?!
My shit is real, my shit is raw, my shit is authentic

Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Girl, I'm in love with you
But this ain't the honeymoon
We're passed the infatuation phase
We're right in the thick of love
At times we get sick of love
It seems like we argue every day
I know I misbehaved
And you made your mistakes
And we've both still got room left to grow
And though love sometimes hurts
I still put you first
And we'll make this thing work
But I think we should take it slow

[Hook]
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
'Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow

[Verse 2]
This ain't a movie, no
No fairytale conclusion y'all
It gets more confusing every day, oh
Sometimes it's Heaven sent
Then we head back to Hell again
We kiss, then we make up on the way
I hang up, you call
We rise and we fall
And we feel like just walking away
As our love advances
We take second chances
Though it's not a fantasy
I still want you to stay

[Hook]
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
'Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, yeah, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow

[Verse 3]
Maybe we'll live and learn
Maybe we'll crash and burn
Maybe you'll stay
Maybe you'll leave
Maybe you'll return
Maybe another fight
Maybe we won't survive
Maybe we'll grow
We'll never know
Baby, you and I

[Outro]
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go, yeah, hey
'Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow, hey, hey
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go, yeah
'Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, slow

Yeah

[Verse 1]
Sunday morning, rain is falling
Steal some covers, share some skin (Like that)
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in

[Refrain]
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday, it would lead me back to you
That someday, it would lead me back to you (Someday)

[Chorus]
That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

[Verse 2]
Fingers trace your every outline
Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth, we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather, still together when it ends

[Chorus]
That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

[Refrain]
Oh yeah, but things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
Sunday morning, rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
Singing, someday it'll bring me back to you (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
Find a way to bring myself back home to you

[Chorus]
And you may not know
That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see (You are all I see)
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
Driving slow, ooh, yeah, yeah...

I'm not sure what I see
Cupid don't fuck with me!
Are you telling me this is a sign?
She's looking in my eyes, and I don't see no other guys
Are you telling me this is a sign? (Oh)
Don't think about it, boy leave her alone (Ooh wee)
Nigga you ain't no G!
She likes my tone, my cologne and the way I roll, you ain't no G!

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
It's legit, you know it's a hit
When The Neptunes and the Doggy Dogg fin to spit
You know he's in - tune with the season
Come here baby, tell me why you leaving?
Tell me if it's weed that you need
If you wanna breathe, I got the best weed minus seeds
Ain't nobody tripping, VIP they can't get in
If something go wrong then you know we get to Cripping

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake + Snoop Dogg]
I'm not sure what I see

Don't think about it, boy leave her alone (Oh, oh, yeah!)
Nigga you ain't no G!
She likes my tone, my cologne and the way I roll
(Do-do-do-do-do-do) You ain't no G!

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg with Justin Timberlake]
Now you stepping with a G, from Los Angeles
Where the helicopters got cameras
Just to get a glimpse of our Chucks
And our Khakis and our bouncing cars
You wit you friend right? (Yeah!)
She ain't trying to bring over no men right? (No!)
Shit, she ain't gotta be in the distance
She could get high all in an instant

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake + Snoop Dogg]
I'm not sure what I see
Cupid don't fuck with me!
Are you telling me this is a sign?
She's looking in my eyes, and I don't see no other guys
Are you telling me this is a sign?
Don't think about it, boy leave her alone (Oh, oh, yeah!)
Nigga you ain't no G!
She likes my tone, my cologne and the way I roll
(Do-do-do-do-do-do) You ain't no G!

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Mami, mamacita, have you ever flown on G5s
From London to Ibiza? You gotta have cake to
You'll have Sunday's with chiquitas
You'll see Venus and Serena, in the Wimbledon Arena
And I can take you

[Bridge: Charlie Wilson + Justin Timberlake]
(Uncle Charlie, preach)
Nigga don't be young and foolish
You don't know what you're doing
You don't know what you've lost until she's gone (til she's gone)
She got a pretty face, drove you wild
But you ain't have that Snoop Doggy Dogg Style

I'm not sure what I see
Cupid don't fuck with me!
Are you telling me this is a sign?

Everything is still black and white
It is a long, long way from wrong to right
From Sunday morning to Saturday night

We follow the roads that lead us
To drugs or Jesus

From the stained glass windows in my mind
Refusing to let God's light shine
Down on me

295,295,Happy?,"In this hole
That is me
The dead are rolling over
In this hole
Thickening
Dirt shoveled over shoulders

I feel it in me
So overwhelmed
Oh, this pressured center rising
My life overturned
Unfair the despair
All these scars keep ripping open

Peel me from the skin
Tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now?

Tear meat from the bone
Tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy now?

In this hole
That is me
A life that's growing feeble
In this hole
So limiting
The sun has set; all darkens

Buried underneath
Hands slip off the wheel
Internal path-way to contention

Peel me from the skin
Tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now?

Tear meat from the bone
Tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy now?

Are you
HAPPY?

Are you
HAPPY?

Are you feeling happy?

In this hole
That is me
Left with a heart exhausted
What's my release?
What sets me free?
Do you pull me up just to push me down again?

Peel me from the skin
Tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now?

Tear meat from the bone
Tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy?

Peel me from the skin...
(Peel me from the skin)...
Tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now?

Tear me from the bone...
(Tear me from the bone)...
Tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy?

Does it make you HAPPY?
Are you feeling HAPPY?
Are you fucking happy
Now that I'm lost, left with nothing?

Does it make you HAPPY?

297,297,Mockingbird,"Ouais, je sais que parfois
Les choses peuvent sembler, ne pas avoir de sens pour toi maintenant
Mais! Qu'est ce que papa t'as toujours dit? Tiens toi droit petit soldat
Ne laisse pas ta lèvre supérieur trembler...Pourquoi tu pleures? Tu m'as moi

Hailie je sais que ta maman te manque, et je sais que ton papa te manque quand je pars
Mais j'essaie de t'offrir la vie que je n'ai jamais eu
Je sais que t'es triste, même quand tu souris,même lorsque tu ris
Je peux le voir dans tes yeux, au fond tu as envie de pleurer
Car tu as peur n'est ce pas? Papa est avec toi dans tes prières
Plus de pleurs, sèche tes larmes, papa est là, plus de cauchemars
Nous les surpasserons tout les deux,nous le ferons ensemble!
Laney, tonton est fou,oui, mais il t'aime et fera tout pour que tu le saches
Tout ce qu'on a c'est nous,quand ça vrille, quand ça tourbillonne
Quand ça tournois ou que tout devient flou
Deux magnifiques petites filles,elles ont l'air confuses et étourdies
Je sais que tout ça t'embrouille
Papa n'est jamais là, maman est toujours dans les journaux
J'essaie de te mettre à l'abris de tout ces soucis pour te protéger
Mais j'ai l'impression que quelle que soit la manière
J'ai beau essayé, ça se retourne contre moi
Toutes les choses prenant sans cesse de l'ampleur que papa a été forcé de voir
Papa voulait pas que tu les voies mais tu les as vu autant que moi
Nous n'avions pas prévus tout ça,ta mère et moi
Mais les choses se sont si mal passées entre nous,je ne nous vois plus ensemble
Comme nous l'étions lors de notre adolescence, mais aussi bien sur
Tout se passe toujours pour une certaine raison
J'imagine que ça n'aurait jamais du avoir lieu
Mais c'est seulement quelque chose sur quoi nous n'avons aucun contrôle
C'est le destin, Mais n'ai plus peur, repose ta tête et va dormir
Peut etre qu'un jour nous nous réveillerons et cela n'aura été qu'un simple rêve


Maintenant calme toi petit bébé, ne pleure pas, Tout se passera bien
Ne laisse pas ta lèvre supérieur trembler, petite dame
Papa est là pour te porter à travers la nuit
Je sais que maman n'est pas là en ce moment et nous se savons pas pourquoi
Nous avons peur de nos sentiments, ça peut paraître un peu fou, jolie bébé
Mais je te promet, maman se remettra

C'est bizarre...Je me souvient d'une année ou papa n'avait pas d'argent
Maman avait emballé les cadeaux de noël et les avait mis sous le sapin
Et avait dit que certains d'entre eux étaient de ma part
Papa ne pouvait pas les acheter
J'oublierai jamais ce noël,je suis resté assis toute la soirée a pleurer
Papa se sentait comme un clochard
Vois tu , le travail de papa était de faire en sorte que la nourriture
Ne disparaissent pas de la table pour toi et maman
Parce qu’a l'époque
Toutes les maisons dans lesquelles nous avons vécues étaient soit
Cambriolées et brûlées, soit endommagées par les balles sifflantes du ghetto
Et ta maman économisait de l'argent dans un vase afin d'établir une tirelire
Rien que pour toi, pour que tu puisses aller a l'université
Elle avait presque récolté 1000$, jusqu’à quand quelqu'un nous cambriole
Et ça blesse profondément à quel point ça a brisé le coeur de ta maman
Tout commença a s’effondrer à partir de ce moment là
Maman et papa se disputaient beaucoup alors maman déménagea dans le Chalmers
Pour un triste appartement avec une seul chambre
Et papa alla s'installé de l'autre coté de 8mile a Novarra
Et tout ça s'est passé quand papa est allé en Californie avec son CD pour rencontrer Dr Dre
Et vous fis venir maman et toi pour me voir, Mais papa devait travailler
Toi et maman deviez me laisser, puis t'as commencé a voir Papa a la télé
Et Maman n'a pas aimé,Laney et toi étaient trop jeunes pour comprendre
Papa été sans cesse sur la route,Maman pris la même habitude
Et tout s'est passé trop vite pour que nous puissions nous ressaisir
Et tu était là a ce moment et je regrette simplement que tu ais connu tout ça
Car tout ce que j'ai toujours voulu c'était te rendre fière
Maintenant je me promène dans cette maison vide,me remémorant des souvenirs
En regardant des photos de maman et toi, votre ressemblance m'a juste ébahi
On dirait que c'est ta soeur désormais,wouah, je suppose que vous devez être belles
Et papa est toujours là,Laney j'te parle à toi aussi,Papa est toujours là
J'aime le son de cette phrase, il y a de la délicatesse dedans..
Chut, maman est partie pour un moment

Maintenant calme toi petit bébé, ne pleure pas, Tout se passera bien
Ne laisse pas ta lèvre supérieur trembler, petite dame
Papa est là pour te porter à travers la nuit
Je sais que maman n'est pas là en ce moment et nous se savons pas pourquoi
Nous avons peur de nos sentiments, ça peut paraître un peu fou, jolie bébé
Mais je te promet, maman se remettra
Et si tu me le demandes, papa t'achèteras un moqueur
Je te donnerai le monde, J’achèterai une bague en diamant rien que pour toi
Je chanterai pour toi, je ferais n'importe quoi pour te voir sourie
Et si je moqueur ne chante pas et que la bague ne brille pas
Je briserai la nuque de cet oiseau, je retournerai chez le bijoutier qui te l'avais vendu
Et lui ferait manger chaque carat jusqu'au dernier...

298,298,Honkytonk U,"[Verse 1]
My grandmother owned a nightclub on the Arkansas-Oklahoma line
Momma put me on a greyhound, and I went
To stay with her in the summertime
I'd box up those empty long necks and stack'em in the back and make
A hand
Then at night she'd let me sneak out of the kitchen and sit in with the band
Yes, I have sacked some quarterbacks and broke my share of bones along the way
I knew it wouldn't
Last forever, semi-pro always means semi-paid
I started climbing' drilling' rig, I'm oil field trash and
Proud as I can be
Then I took my songs and guitar and sang'em to a man from Tennessee

[Chorus]
I've played every beer joint tavern from New York City out to Pasadena
Every corn dog fair and rodeo
And sold out every basketball arena
I like to get down with my boys in Afghanistan and Baghdad city
Too
I am a red, white and blue blood graduate of honkytonk U

[Verse 2]
A star can't burn forever, and the brightest ones will someday lose their shine
But the glass won't
Ever be half empty in my optimistic mind
I'll still have a song to sing and a band to turn it up and
Play it loud
As long as there's a bar room with a corner stage and a honkytonk crowd

[Chorus]
I've played every beer joint tavern from New York City out to Pasadena
Every corn dog fair and rodeo
And sold out ever basketball arena
I like to get down with my boys in Afghanistan and Baghdad city

Pressure!

[Verse 1: Bert McCracken]
Pushing down on me
Pressing down on you no man ask for
(Under pressure)

[Gerard Way]
That burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets

[Bridge: Bert McCracken and Gerard Way]
Bah bah dah bah bah dah
(Yeah) (Yeah)

[Chorus: Bert McCracken]
That's okay!
It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends scream
(""Let me out!"")
(Pray tomorrow takes me higher)
Pressure on people
People on the streets

[Bridge: Bert McCracken and Gerard Way]
Bah bah dah bah bah dah
Okay!

[Verse 2: Gerard Way]
Chipping around
Kick my brains 'round the floor
These are the days
It never rains but it pours
Bah bah dah bah bah dah

[Bridge: Bert McCracken and Gerard Way]
People on streets
Bah dah dee da day
People on streets
Bah dah dee dah dee dah dee dah dee dah

[Chorus: Bert McCracken]
It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends scream
(""Let me out!"")

[Gerard Way]
Pray tomorrow takes me higher (higher)

[Verse 3: Bert McCracken and Gerard Way]
Turned away from it all
Like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love
But it's so slashed and torn

[Bridge: Bert McCracken and Gerard Way]
Why? Why? Why?
Love (love)!
Love (love)!
Love (love)!

[Verse 4: Bert McCracken]
Insanity laughs under pressure
We're cracking
(Can't we give ourselves)
(One more chance?)
(Why can't we give love that one more chance?)

[Bert McCracken and Gerard Way]
Why can't we give love, give love, give love?
Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?
(Because love's such an old-fashioned word)
(And love dares you to care)
(For the people on)
The edge of the night
And love dares you to change our ways
Of caring about ourselves

[Outro: Bert McCracken and Gerard Way]
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves

Yeah, woo, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
You're looking just a little too hard at me
Standing just a little too close to me
You're saying not quite enough to me
You're sipping just a little too slow for me
No doubt you play it real cool, homie
Got me thinking what is it you do for me?
Tripping (Tripping) a little more than I should be
So let yourself go and get right with me

[Chorus]
I'm about to sign you up, we can get right

Can't a woman take advantage of what she wants?
My hips moving, oh, so slow (So slow)
Bar tab looking like a car note (Car note)
All I need is you here right by my side (Woo)
Take whatever you want, baby, let's ride (Oh)
And whatever you won't do, let me decide
Just put your name on the dotted line

301,301,Class Reunion (That Used To Be Us),"[Verse 1]
Well I rolled into town
With the ragtop down
I was looking for that homecoming queen
That three-by-nine lit hotel sign read
Welcome back class of '83
There were football guys twice their size
Cheerleaders hiding the grey in their hair
The names were the same but the faces had changed
I didn't recognize anyone there

[Chorus]
That used to be us, we used to be cool
With the music cranked up, hanging out after school
That used to be Jill, that used to be Joe
Tell me where in the world did we all go
That used to be us
Oh, that used to be us

[Verse 2]
I had a drink with some buds
Played a lot of catch up
Danced with my date from the prom
But as hard as I tried until I closed my eyes
Everybody I knew was gone
There was Mr. Finch, he taught English and French
He was dancing with a couple of canes
And that homecoming queen, yeah the girl of my dreams
She didn't even remember my name

[Chorus]
That used to be us, we used to be cool
With the music cranked up, hanging out after school
That used to be Jill, that used to be Joe
Tell me where in the world did we all go
That used to be us

[Bridge]
As I stand here and look around
I can't help but wonder
Who will we be ten years from now

[Chorus]
That used to be us, we used to be cool
With the music cranked up, hanging out after school
That used to be Jill, that used to be Joe
Tell me where in the world did we all go
That used to be us
Oh that used to be us

Wind me up, put me down
Start me off and watch me go
I'll be runnin' circles around you sooner than you know
A little off center, and I'm out of tune
Just kickin' this can along the avenue
But I'm all right

You can't stop now, it's already begun
You feel it runnin' through your bones
And you jerk it out when you jerk it out

Shut up, hush your mouth
Can't you hear, you talk too loud?
No, I can't hear nothing because I got my head up in the clouds
I bite off anything that I can chew

Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else
I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times
But somehow, I want more

[Chorus]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

[Verse 2]
Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
Doesn't matter anymore
It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along, yeah
My heart is full and my door's always open
You come any time you want, yeah

[Chorus]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

I know where you hide
Alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and makes me catch her every time she falls, yeah

I want to make you feel beautiful

I set out on a narrow way many years ago
Hoping I would find true love along the broken road
But I got lost a time or two
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through
I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you

[Chorus]
Every long lost dream led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart, they were like Northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God bless the broken road that led me straight to you
(Yes, he did)

[Verse 2]
I think about the years I spent just passing through
I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you
But you just smile and take my hand
You've been there, you understand
It's all part of a grander plan that is coming true

[Chorus]
Every long lost dream led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart, they were like Northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God bless the broken road that led me straight to you
(Yeah)

[Verse 3]
Now I'm just rolling home
Into my lover's arms
This much I know is true
That God bless the broken road that led me straight to you

The droll delight of deemsterhood, a win from the wood to bond. Like the bright lamps, Thamamahalla, yearin out yearin. Auspicably suspectable but in expectancy of respectable-ness. From dirty flock bedding, drip dropping through the ceil — ing, with two sisters of charities on the front steps and three eva — cuan cleansers at the back gaze, single box and pair of chairs (suspectable), occasionally and alternatively used by husband when having writing to do in connection with equitable druids and friendly or other societies through periods of dire want with comparative plenty (thunderburst, ravishment, dissolution and providentiality) to a sofa allbeit of hoarsehaar with Amodicum cloth, hired payono, still playing off, used by the youngsters for czurnying out oldstrums, three bedrooms upastairs, of which one with fireplace (aspectable), with greenhouse in prospect (par-ticularly perspectable).

Down.

Like Jukoleon, the seagoer, when he bore down in his perry boat he had raised a slide and shipped his orders and seized his pullets and primed their plumages, the fionnling and dubhlet, the dun and the fire, and, sending them one by other to fare fore fom, he had behold the residuance of a delugion: the foggy doze still going strong, the old thalassocrats of invinsible empores, maskers of the waterworld, facing one way to another way and this way on that way, from severalled their fourdimmansions. Where the lighning leaps from the numbulous; where coold by cawld breide lieth langwid; the bounds whereinbourne our solied bodies all attomed attaim arrest: appoint, that’s all. But see what follows. Wringlings upon wronglings among incomputables about an uncomeoutable (an angel prophetethis? kingcorrier of beheasts? the calif in his halifskin? that eyriewinging one?) and the voids bubbily vode’s dodos across the which the boomomouths from their dupest dupes were in envery and anononously blowing great.

Not to pad them behaunt in the fear. Not to go, tonnerwatter, and bungley well chute the rising gianerant. Not to wandly be woking around jerumsalemdo at small hours about the murketplots, smelling okey boney, this little figgy and arraky belloky this little pink into porker but, porkodirto, to let the gentlemen pedesta-rolies out of the Monabella culculpuration live his own left leave, cullebuone, by perperusual of the petpubblicities without inwoking his also’s between (sic) the arraky bone and (suc) the okey bellock. And not to not be always, hemmer and hummer, treeing unselves up with one exite but not to never be caving nicely, pre-cisely, quicely, rebustly, tendrolly, unremarkably, forsakenly, hal — tedly, reputedly, firstly, somewhatly, yesayenolly about the back excits. Never to weaken up in place of the broths. Never to vvol-lusslleepp in the pleece of the poots. And, allerthings, never to ate the sour deans if they weren’t having anysin on their consients. And, when in Zumschloss, to never, narks, cease till the finely ending was consummated by the completion of accomplishment.

And thus within the tavern’s secret booth The wisehight ones who sip the tested sooth Bestir them as the Just has bid to jab The punch of quaram on the mug of truth.

So anyhow, melumps and mumpos of the hoose uncommons, after that to wind up that longtobechronickled gettogether thanksbetogiving day at Glenfinnisk-en-la-Valle, the anniver-sary of his finst homy

was anything you say yourself be — tween fiftyodd and fiftyeven years of age at the time after the socalled last supper he greatly gave in his umbrageous house of the hundred bottles with the radio beamer tower and its hangars, chimbneys and equilines or, at least, he was’nt actually the then last king of all Ireland for the time being for the jolly good reason that he was still such as he was

handwedown pile after all of them had all gone off with themselves to their castles of mud, as best they cud, on footback, owing to the leak of the McCarthy’s mare, in extended order, a tree’s length from the longest way out, down the switchbackward slidder of the land-sown route of Hauburnea’s liveliest vinnage on the brain, the unimportant Parthalonians with the mouldy Firbolgs and the Tuatha de Danaan googs and the ramblers from Clane and all the rest of the notmuchers that he did not care the royal spit out of his ostensible mouth about, well, what do you think he did, sir, but, faix, he just went heeltapping through the winespilth and weevily popcorks that were kneedeep round his own right royal round rollicking toper’s table, with his old Roderick Ran-dom pullon hat at a Lanty Leary can't on him and Mike Brady’s shirt and Greene’s linnet collarbow and his Ghenter’s gaunts and his Macclefield’s swash and his readymade Reillys and his pan-prestuberian poncho, the body you’d pity him, the way the world is, poor he, the heart of Midleinster and the supereminent lord of them all, overwhelmed as he was with black ruin like a sponge out of water, allocutioning in bellcantos to his own oliverian society MacGuiney’s Dreans of Ergen Adams and thruming through all to himself with diversed tonguesed through his old tears and his ould plaised drawl. starkened by the most regal of

309,309,God's Will,"[Verse 1]
I met God's Will on a Halloween night
He was dressed as a bag of leaves
It hid the braces on his legs at first
His smile was as bright as the August sun
When he looked at me
As he struggled down the driveway
It almost made me hurt
Will don't walk too good
Will don't talk too good
He won't do the things that the other kids do
In our neighborhood

[Chorus]
I've been searching, wondering, thinking
Lost and looking all my life
I've been wounded, jaded, loved, and hated
I've wrestled wrong and right
He was a boy without a father
And his mother's miracle
I've been reading, writing, praying, fighting
I guess I would be still
Yeah, that was until
I knew God's Will

[Verse 2]
Will's mom had to work two jobs
We'd watch him when she had to work late
And we'd all laugh like I hadn't laughed
Since I don't know when
""Hey Jude"" was his favorite song
At dinner he'd ask to pray
And then he'd pray for everybody in the world but him

[Chorus]
I've been searching, wondering, thinking
Lost and looking all my life
I've been wounded, jaded, loved, and hated
I've wrestled wrong and right
He was a boy without a father
And his mother's miracle
I've been reading, writing, praying, fighting
I guess I would be still
Yeah, that was until
I knew God's Will

[Verse 3]
Before they moved to California
His mother said, they didn't think he'd live
And she said each day that I have him
Well, it's just another gift
And I never got to tell her
That the boy showed me the truth
In crayon red, on notebook paper, he'd written
Me and God love you

[Outro]
I've been searching, praying, wounded, jaded
I guess I would be still
Yeah that was until
I met God's Will on a Halloween night

[Verse 1]
It's about time we had our own song
Don't know what took so long
Cause nowadays
It's like a badge of honor to be a baby mama
I see ya payin' ya bills
I see ya workin' ya job
I see ya goin' to school
And girl, I know it's hard
And even though ya fed up
With makin' beds up
Girl, keep ya head up

[Verse 2]
I see you get that support check in the mail
You open it and you're like, ""What the hell?""
You say, ""This ain't even half of daycare.""
Saying to yourself, ""This here ain't fair.""
And all my girls who don't get no help
Who gotta do everything by yourself
Remember
What don't kill you can only make you stronger
My baby mama...

I know we can make it if we dream
And I think it should be a holiday

But until then
Here is your song
Show love to my....

311,311,How Do You Get That Lonely,"It was just another story printed on the second page, underneath the Tiger's football score
It said he was only eighteen, a boy about my age
They found him face down on his bedroom floor
There'll be services on Friday at the Lawrence Funeral Home, then out on Mooresville Highway, they'll lay him 'neath a stone

How do you get that lonely?
How do you hurt that bad to make you
Make the call that having no life at all is better than the life that you had?
How do you feel so empty you want to let it all go?
How do you get that lonely and nobody know?

Did his girlfriend break up with him?
Did he buy or steal that gun?
Did his mom and daddy forget to say ""I love you, son?""
Did no one see the writing on the wall?

I'm not blamin' anybody
We all do the best we can
I know hindsight's 20/20
But I still don't understand

How do you get that lonely?
How do you hurt that bad to make you
Make the call that having no life at all was better than the life that you had?
How do you feel so empty you want to let it all go?
How do you get that lonely and nobody know?

Tough, you think you've got the stuff
You're telling me and anyone
You're hard enough

You don't have to put up a fight
You don't have to always be right
Let me take some of the punches
For you tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Listen to me now
I need to let you know
You don't have to go it alone

And it's you when I look in the mirror
And it's you when I don't pick up the phone
Sometimes you can't make it on your own

[Verse 2]
We fight all the time
You and I, that's alright
We're the same soul
I don't need, I don't need to hear you say
That if we weren't so alike
You'd like me a whole lot more

I'm sick of it all
Can - you - hear - me - when - I -
Sing, you're the reason I sing
You're the reason why the opera is in me

Well, hey now
Still I've got to let you know
A house doesn't make a home
Don't leave me here alone

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When the pimp's in the crib, ma
Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot
When the pigs try to get at you
Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot
And if a nigga get a attitude
Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot
I got the Rolly on my arm, and I'm pourin' Chandon
And I roll the best weed ‘cause I got it goin' on

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
I'm a nice dude, with some nice dreams
See these ice cubes? See these Ice Creams?
Eligible bachelor, million dollar boat
That's whiter than what's spillin' down your throat
The Phantom, exterior like fish eggs
The interior like suicide wrist red
I can exercise you, this can be your Phys. Ed
Cheat on your man, ma, that's how you get ahizzead
Killer with the beat, I know killers in the street
With the steel that'll make you feel like Chinchilla in the heat
So don't try to run up on my ear
Talkin' all that raspy shit, tryin' to ask me shit
When my niggas fill your vest they ain't gon' pass me shit
You should think about it, take a second (Ding)
Matter fact, you should take four, b
And think before you fuck with lil Skateboard P

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]

I'm a gangsta, but y'all knew that
Da Big Boss Dogg, yeah I had to do that
I keep a blue flag hangin' out my backside
But only on the left side, yeah, that's the Crip side
Ain't no other way to play the game the way I play
I cut so much you thought I was a DJ
""Two, one, yep, three!""
S-N double O-P, D-O double G
I can't fake it, just break it, and when I take it
See, I specialize in makin' all the girls get naked
So bring your friends, all of y'all come inside
We got a world premiere right here, now get live!
So don't change the dizzle, turn it up a little
I got a livin' room full of fine dime brizzles
Waitin' on the Pizzle, the Dizzle and the Chizzle
G's to the bizzack—now, ladies, here we gizzo!

I'm a bad boy, with a lot of hoes
Drive my own cars, and wear my own clothes
I hang out tough, I'm a real boss
Big Snoop Dogg, yeah he's so sharp
On the TV screen and in the magazines
If you play me close, you're on a red beam
Oh you got a gun, so you wanna pop back?
AK-47 now, nigga, stop that!
Cement shoes, now I'm on the move
Your family's cryin', now you on the news
They can't find you, and now they miss you
Must I remind you, I'm only here to twist you
Pistol-whip you, dip you, then flip you
Then dance to this mothafuckin' music we Crip to
Subscribe, nigga, get your issue
Baby, come close, let me see how you get loose!

They say this town
The stars stay up all night
Don't know, can't see 'em
For the glow of the neon lights
And it's a long way from here
To the place where the home fires burn
Well, it's 2,000 miles and one left turn

[Chorus]
Dear Mom and Dad
Please send money
I'm so broke that it ain't funny
But I don't need much, just enough to get me through
Please don't worry 'cause I'm alright
See, I'm playin' here at the bar tonight
Well, this time I'm gonna make our dreams come true
Well, I love you more than anything in the world
Love, your baby girl

[Verse 2]
Black top, blue sky
Big town full of little white lies
Well, everybody's your friend, you can never be sure
They'll promise fancy cars and diamond rings
And all sorts of shiny things
But girl, you'll remember what your knees are for

What do you know? We made our dreams come true
And there are fancy cars and diamond rings
But you know that they don't mean a thing

Something makes me wanna come in there and get a feel
Walk around in your T-shirt, with nothing else on
Strutting past, switching that ass, while I'm on the phone, ooh

Cutting up tomatoes
Fruits and vegetables and potatoes
Girl, you look so sexy while you're doing the damn thing

I want sex in the kitchen, over by the stove

Tell me right now, babe (Yeah, I'm going to call you back)

While making love, I'll be feasting you

[Verse 3]
Girl, you're in the kitchen, sweating up a storm
The oven's on 500, so you know the kitchen's warm
Girl, you know just how to get into a brother's mind

320,320,I May Hate Myself In The Morning,"Ain't it just like one of us
To pick up the phone and call after a couple drinks
And say how you been, I've been wondering if
Maybe you've been thinkin about me
And somewhere in the conversation
An old familiar invitation always arrives
I may hate myself in the morning
But I'm gonna love you tonight

Everyone's known someone that they
Just can't help but want
Even though we just can't make it work out
The want to, lingers on
So once again, we wind up in each other's arms
Pretending that it's right
And I may hate myself in the morning
But I'm gonna love you tonight

I know it's wrong, but it ain't easy movin' on
So why can't two friends
Remember the good times once again

Tomorrow when I wake up
I'll be feelin' a little guilty, a little sad
Thinkin' how it used to be before everything went bad
I guess that's what it is all lonely
Late night calls like this, that we try to find
I may hate myself in the morning
But I'm gonna love you tonight
I may hate msyelf in the morning

(Bring 'em out, Its hard to yell when the barrels in ya mouth) Swizzie!
(Bring 'em out, bring 'em out) Aye!
(Bring 'em out, bring 'em out) T.I
(Bring 'em out, bring 'em out) Aye!

[Verse 1]
TIP comin live from the VIP, heard the night life lost life without me
Both the Feds and the State wanna see bout me
The whole city got bizzerk he got treat
Anotha nigga got a hit but shawty he not me
Who set the city on fire as soon as he got freed
Da king back now broads don't even know how to act now
Hit the club, strippers gettin' naked 'fore I sat down
Still ballin money stack taller than Shaq now
Still push a button to let the roof on the 'Lac down
I'm on the road doin shows puttin my mack down
Mississippi to Philly Albuquerque to Chatt Town

[Chorus]
I got the crowd yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Aye, all my hotgirls yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Aye, all the Dope Boyz yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Aye, from the back they yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)

[Verse 2]
Once again what other rap nigga hooder than this
I got rich and I'm still on some hoolagin shit
You be rappin bout blow I was movin the shit
You talkin bout shootin out and I was doin the shit
If I hit you in the face you gon be suin and shit
And if I catch anotha case I know I'm truly to be missed
So I'mma keep it cool head stay out of the news
Headlines and shows other rappers its bedtime (bedtime)
It's clear to see that I'm ahead of my time
I copped a chromed out hard top Carrerra to shine
I got some time, it ain't shit cause I get better wit time
Who got a flow and a live show better than mine

[Chorus]
I got the crowd yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Aye, all my hotgirls yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Aye, all the Dope Boyz yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Aye, from the back they yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)

[Verse 3]
Mic check 1-2 1-2, you wanna beef wit the king what is you gon do
Will you show up on the scene wit 2 guns drew
Or you and ya friend and play a little two on two
If you knew half of what I knew then you'll be hittin the deck
Got a tool and a vest I can get some respect
I'mma make it hard for a sucka nigga to flex
Sho 'em this ain't the squad for a nigga to test
Pimp my nutz too large and we way too fresh
Work well wit Nines, AK's, and Tecs
And quick to check a lame like a game of chess
You want beef you can bring ya best and we'll be standin..

[Chorus]
I got the crowd yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Aye, all my hotgirls yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Aye, all the Dope Boyz yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Aye, from the back they yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
I got the crowd yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Aye, all my hotgirls yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Aye, all the Dope Boyz yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Aye, from the back they yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)

324,324,Devils & Dust,"[Verse 1]
I got my finger on the trigger
But I don't know who to trust
When I look into your eyes
There's just devils and dust
We're a long, long way from home, Bobbie
Home's a long, long way from us
I feel a dirty wind blowing
Devils and dust

[Chorus]
I got God on my side
And I'm just trying to survive
What if what you do to survive
Kills the things you love
Fear's a powerful thing, baby
It can turn your heart black you can trust
It'll take your God filled soul
And fill it with devils and dust

[Verse 2]
Well I dreamed of you last night
In a field of blood and stone
The blood began to dry
The smell began to rise
Well I dreamed of you last night, Bobbie
In a field of mud and bone
Your blood began to dry
And the smell began to rise

[Chorus]
We've got God on our side
We're just trying to survive
What if what you do to survive
Kills the things you love
Fear's a powerful thing
It'll turn your heart black you can trust
It'll take your God filled soul
Fill it with devils and dust
It'll take your God filled soul
Fill it with devils and dust

[Verse 3]
Now every woman and every man
They want to take a righteous stand
Find the love that God wills
And the faith that He commands
I've got my finger on the trigger
And tonight faith just ain't enough
When I look inside my heart
There's just devils and dust

[Chorus]
Well I've got God on my side
And I'm just trying to survive
What if what you do to survive
Kills the things you love
Fear's a dangerous thing
It can turn your heart black you can trust
It'll take your God filled soul
Fill it with devils and dust
Yeah it'll take your God filled soul
Fill it with devils and dust","['i', 'get', 'my', 'finger', 'on', 'the', 'trigger', 'but', 'i', 'dont', 'know', 'who', 'to', 'trust', 'when', 'i', 'look', 'into', 'your', 'eye', 'theres', 'just', 'devil', 'and', 'dust', 'be', 'a', 'long', 'long', 'way', 'from', 'home', 'bobbie', 'home', 'a', 'long', 'long', 'way', 'from', 'us', 'i', 'feel', 'a', 'dirty', 'wind', 'blow', 'devil', 'and', 'dust', 'i', 'get', 'god', 'on', 'my', 'side', 'and', 'im', 'just', 'try', 'to', 'survive', 'what', 'if', 'what', 'you', 'do', 'to', 'survive', 'kill', 'the', 'things', 'you', 'love', 'fear', 'a', 'powerful', 'thing', 'baby', 'it', 'can', 'turn', 'your', 'heart', 'black', 'you', 'can', 'trust', 'itll', 'take', 'your', 'god', 'fill', 'soul', 'and', 'fill', 'it', 'with', 'devil', 'and', 'dust', 'well', 'i', 'dream', 'of', 'you', 'last', 'night', 'in', 'a', 'field', 'of', 'blood', 'and', 'stone', 'the', 'blood', 'begin', 'to', 'dry', 'the', 'smell', 'begin', 'to', 'rise', 'well', 'i', 'dream', 'of', 'you', 'last', 'night', 'bobbie', 'in', 'a', 'field', 'of', 'mud', 'and', 'bone', 'your', 'blood', 'begin', 'to', 'dry', 'and', 'the', 'smell', 'begin', 'to', 'rise', 'weve', 'get', 'god', 'on', 'our', 'side', 'be', 'just', 'try', 'to', 'survive', 'what', 'if', 'what', 'you', 'do', 'to', 'survive', 'kill', 'the', 'things', 'you', 'love', 'fear', 'a', 'powerful', 'thing', 'itll', 'turn', 'your', 'heart', 'black', 'you', 'can', 'trust', 'itll', 'take', 'your', 'god', 'fill', 'soul', 'fill', 'it', 'with', 'devil', 'and', 'dust', 'itll', 'take', 'your', 'god', 'fill', 'soul', 'fill', 'it', 'with', 'devil', 'and', 'dust', 'now', 'every', 'woman', 'and', 'every', 'man', 'they', 'want', 'to', 'take', 'a', 'righteous', 'stand', 'find', 'the', 'love', 'that', 'god', 'will', 'and', 'the', 'faith', 'that', 'he', 'command', 'ive', 'get', 'my', 'finger', 'on', 'the', 'trigger', 'and', 'tonight', 'faith', 'just', 'aint', 'enough', 'when', 'i', 'look', 'inside', 'my', 'heart', 'theres', 'just', 'devil', 'and', 'dust', 'well', 'ive', 'get', 'god', 'on', 'my', 'side', 'and', 'im', 'just', 'try', 'to', 'survive', 'what', 'if', 'what', 'you', 'do', 'to', 'survive', 'kill', 'the', 'things', 'you', 'love', 'fear', 'a', 'dangerous', 'thing', 'it', 'can', 'turn', 'your', 'heart', 'black', 'you', 'can', 'trust', 'itll', 'take', 'your', 'god', 'fill', 'soul', 'fill', 'it', 'with', 'devil', 'and', 'dust', 'yeah', 'itll', 'take', 'your', 'god', 'fill', 'soul', 'fill', 'it', 'with', 'devil', 'and', 'dust']",321,Bruce Springsteen,Bruce Springsteen,2005,[72],1,Devils & Dust,https://open.spotify.com/track/4YUSC63LMMUbaeLjcfT4Go,4YUSC63LMMUbaeLjcfT4Go,spotify:track:4YUSC63LMMUbaeLjcfT4Go,Devils & Dust,2LG4zoUVueg6iYQTHEQLx6,spotify:album:2LG4zoUVueg6iYQTHEQLx6,Bruce Springsteen,3eqjTLE0HfPfh78zjh6TqT,spotify:artist:3eqjTLE0HfPfh78zjh6TqT,298.626,12.0,38.0,2005-04-26,0.638,0.44299999999999995,2.0,-6.86,1.0,0.0283,0.374,0.00048300000000000003,0.547,0.556,111.079,"['classic rock', 'heartland rock', 'mellow gold', 'permanent wave', 'rock', 'singer-songwriter']",[],1.0
325,325,Mud On The Tires,"[Verse 1]
I've got some big news
The bank finally came through
And I'm holding the keys to a brand new Chevrolet
Have you been outside it sure is a nice night
How about a little test drive
Down by the lake

There's a place I know about where the dirt road runs out
And we can try out the four-wheel drive
Come on now what do you say
Girl, I can hardly wait to get a little mud on the tires

[Chorus]
Cause it's a good night
To be out there soaking up the moonlight
Stake out a little piece of shoreline
I've got the perfect place in mind
It's in the middle of nowhere only one way to get there
You got to get a little mud on the tires

[Verse 2]
Moonlight on a duck blind
Catfish on a trot line
Sun sets about nine this time of year
We can throw a blanket down
Crickets singing in the background
And more stars than you can count on a night this clear

I tell you what we need to do is grab a sleeping bag or two
And build us a little campfire
And then with a little luck we might just get stuck
Let's get a little mud on the tires

[Chorus]

326,326,You're My Better Half,"[Verse 1]
Car door slams, it's been a long day at work
I'm out on the freeway and I'm wondering if it's all worth
The price that I pay, sometimes it doesn't seem fair
I pull into the drive and you're standing there
And you look at me
And give me that come-here-baby smile
It's all going to be alright
You take my hand
You pull me close and you hold me tight

[Chorus]
And it's the sweet love that you give to me
That makes me believe we can make it through anything
Because when it all comes down
And I'm feeling like I'll never last
I just lean on you because baby
You're my better half

[Verse 2]
They say behind every man is a good woman
But I think that's a lie
Because when it comes to you I'd rather have you by my side
You don't know how much I count on you to help me win
When I've given everything I got and I just feel like giving in
And you look at me
And give me that come-here-baby smile
It's all going to be alright
You take my hand
Yeah you pull me close and you hold me tight

[Chorus]
And it's the sweet love that you give to me
That makes me believe we can make it through anything

That makes me believe that we can make it through anything

Do you feel this?
I know you feel this
Are you ready?

So I can ride on the clouds
So I can turn up the bass like
Somebody pass my guitar
So I can look like a star
And spend this cash like

What you gonna do when the crowd goes 'ayo'?
Why you standing on the wall?
Music starting everywhere
So why don’t you just move along?

Get up out of your seat
Why don’t you do somethin'?

Now you all in my grill
'Cause I say what I feel
Only rock to what's real
Baby, bump, bump
But I can't do that with you
Only here with my crew
You can roll if you can
Don’t be a punk, punk

I know a girl
She puts the color inside of my world
But she's just like a maze
Where all of the walls all continually change
And I've done all I can
To stand on the steps with my heart in my hand
Now I'm starting to see
Maybe it's got nothing to do with me

[Chorus]
Fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

[Verse 2]
Oh, you see that skin?
It's the same she's been standing in
Since the day she saw him walking away
Now she's left
Cleaning up the mess he made

[Chorus]
So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

[Verse 3]
Boys, you can break
You find out how much they can take
Boys will be strong
And boys soldier on
But boys would be gone without warmth from
A woman's good, good heart

[Bridge]
On behalf of every man
Looking out for every girl
You are the God and the weight of her world

Ah, uh, whoo, yeah! Ready?
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Chester Bennington (& Mike Shinoda)]
(Can I get a encore, do you want more?)
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Uh, uh, uh, uh (Yeah)
Now, what the hell are you waiting for?
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga, make some noise

[Post-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Get 'em Jay!

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that!
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back, yeah, hearin' me rap
Is like hearin' G. Rap in his prime, I'm
Young H.O., rap's grateful dead
'Bout to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep!
Grand openin', grand closin'
God damn, your man Hov' cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him
With no pen, just draw off inspira-tion-tion
Soon you gon' see you can't replace him-him
With cheap imitations for these generations

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Chester Bennington (& Mike Shinoda)]

Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Uh, uh, uh, uh (Yeah)
Now, what the hell are you waiting for?
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga, make some noise
What the hell are you waiting for?

[Verse 2: Jay-Z & Mike Shinoda]
Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you?
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you (Look how they wave to you)
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (Yeah)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan
Wearin' the 45, it ain't to play games with you
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin' you to smithereens
Cocksucker, take one for your team
And I need you to remember one thing (One thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales, to sold-out concerts
So, motherfucker, if you want this encore
I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore (Come on)

[Verse 3: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take!

[Chorus 2: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb

[Outro: Jay-Z & Chester Bennington]
Can I get a encore? Do you want more? (More, more, more)

You felt so good in it; no bigger than a minute
How it amazes me you're changin' with every blink
Faster than a flower blooms, they grow up all too soon

Cause they're only that way for a while
Give 'em hope, give them praise
Give them love every day
Let 'em cry, let 'em giggle
Let 'em sleep in the middle

I never felt so much in one little tender touch
I live for those kisses, your prayers an' your wishes
An' now you're teachin' me how only a child can see
Tonight, while we're on our knees, all I ask is:

Please, let them be little

Give them hope, give them praise
Give them love every day

You turn around, an' it's time to let them go

332,332,Like Toy Soldiers,"[Hook]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

[Verse 1]
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe-to-toe with a Benzino
It don't matter, I never drag 'em in battles that I can't handle
'Less I absolutely have to, I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit, I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross, and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, the shit went way beyond some JAY-Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it that I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, that's not why I got in it
That was never my object, for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy something I helped build?
That wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' ****
And that was just outta respect, for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about somethin' that I knew nothin' about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over TV, down-talkin' the man
Who literally saved my life, like fuck it, I understand
This is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' the shit could pop off at any minute, ‘cause—

[Hook]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

[Verse 2]
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and
Wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated, ‘cause once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated — it ain't just words no more, is it?
It's a different ballgame, you call names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him
Fuck it, 50, smash him! Mash on him, let him have it
Meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'?
Well, fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then!
But I'm so busy bein' pissed off, I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.
And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
But we still have soldiers that's on the front line
Who's willin' to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
To show 'em we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is
To have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man, if y'all can quit poppin'
Off at the jaws, well, then I can, ‘cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience ‘cause—

333,333,So What The Fuss,"[Verse 1]
If i'm caught at a dance party without my dancing shoes
And everybody dances on my bare feet
Shame on me
If i'm minding my business just doing the right thing
And you try to front me off in the street
Shame on you
If a family's waiting for that special blessing to
Come their way
But they ain't trying to get on their knees and pray
Shame on them
And if we live in a time where every nation's fighting
Around the world
Yet we can't all agree that peace is the way
Shame on us

[Chorus]
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
So what the fuss

[Verse 2]
If i gotta get up early in the morning for a job
Interview
And i forget to set the stupid alarm
Shame on me
If my children are playing outside like little children do
And you come around there trying to bring them some harm
Shame on you
Should i be driving thru a klantown, find a restaurant
To get me some food
And someone says ""hey boy, we don't serve your kind""
Shame on them
And if we live in a democracy and you don't use your
Power to vote
Knowing some would like to turn back the hands of time
Shame on us

[Chorus]
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
So what the fuss

[Verse 3]
If I'm hooked on a habit knowing damn well it could
Cost me my life
Yet i keep doing what i should do without
Shame on me
If you're locked in a marriage and your other half
Just gives you abuse
Yet you've convinced yourself that there's no way out
Shame on you
If we're jamming the music and somebody's got the
Audacity
To say that they can jam it better than us
Shame on them
And should there be just a handful that believe that
We are totally free
And there's no need to fight for equality
Shame on us

[Chorus]
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
So what the fuss
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
So what the fuss

Yeek yeek! (woop, woop) why you all in my ear?
Talking a whole bunch of shit that I ain't trying to hear!
Get back motherfucker, you don't know me like that!
(Get back motherfucker You don't know me like that)
Yeek yeek! (woop, woop) I ain't playing around!
Make one false move I'll take ya down
Get back motherfucker, you don't know me like that!
(Get back motherfucker You don't know me like that)

[Verse 1]
Who-o-o!! S-s-so c'mon, c'mon!
Don't get swung on, swung on!
It's the knick knack paddywhack, still ride in Cadillacs
Family off the street! made my homies put the baggies back
Still stacking plaques! (yep!) still action packed! (yep!)
And dough!! I keep it flipping like acrobats!
That's why I pack a mac, that'll crack 'em back
'Cause on my waist there's more Heat than the Shaq Attack
But I ain't speaking about ballin, ballin
Just thinking about brawlin till y'all start bawlin
We all in together now, birds of a feather now
Just bought a plane so we changing the weather now
So put your brakes on, caps put your capes on
Or knock off your block, get dropped and have your face flown
Cause I'll prove it! scratch off the music!
Like hey little stupid! don't make me lose it!!

[Chorus]
Yeek yeek! (woop, woop) why you all in my ear?

[Verse 2]
See I caught 'em wit a right hook, caught 'em wit a jab
Caught 'em wit an uppercut, kicked 'em in his ass
Sent him on his way cause I ain't for that talk!
No trips to the county, I ain't for that walk!
We split like two pins at the end of a lane
We'll knock out your spotlight and put an end to your vain
Put a DTP pendant at the end of yo chain
Then put the booty of a Swisha at the end of a flame

Get down! Cause I ain't got nothing to lose

[Verse 3]
Man! Cause I don't wanna do that
I want to have a good time and enjoy my Jack
Sit back and watch the women get drunk as hell
So I can wake up in the morning wit a story to tell
I know it's been a lil while since I been out the house!
But now I'm here, you wanna stand around running your mouth?!
I can't hear nothing you saying or spitting, so wassup!
Can't you see we in the club?! Man shut the fuck up!!

337,337,Nobody's Home,"[Verse 1]
Well, I couldn't tell you
Why she felt that way
She felt it everyday
And I couldn't help her
I just watched her make
The same mistakes again

[Pre-Chorus 1]
What's wrong, what's wrong now?
Too many, too many problems
Don't know where she belongs
Where she belongs

[Chorus]
She wants to go home, but nobody's home
That's where she lies, broken inside
With no place to go, no place to go
To dry her eyes, broken inside

[Verse 2]
Open your eyes (open your eyes)
And look outside
Find the reasons why
You've been rejected (you've been rejected)
And now you can't find
What you've left behind

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Be strong, be strong now
Too many, too many problems
Don't know where she belongs
Where she belongs

[Chorus]
She wants to go home, but nobody's home
That's where she lies, broken inside
With no place to go, no place to go
To dry her eyes, broken inside

[Bridge]
Her feelings, she hides
Her dreams, she can't find
She's losing her mind
She's falling behind
She can't find her place
She's losing her faith
She's fallen from grace
She's all over the place, yeah

[Chorus]
She wants to go home, but nobody's home
That's where she lies, broken inside
With no place to go, no place to go
To dry her eyes, broken inside

338,338,I Just Wanna Live,"[Verse 1]
I need an alarm system in my house
So I know when people are
Creeping about
These people are
Freaking me out (these days)
It's getting hectic everywhere that I go
They won't leave me alone
There's things they all wanna know
I'm paranoid of all the people I meet
Why are they talking to me?
And why can't anyone see

[Chorus]
I just wanna live
Don't really care about the things that they say
Don't really care about what happens to me
I just wanna live
Just wanna live
Just wanna live
Just wanna live
Just wanna live
Just wanna live
Just wanna live

[Verse 2]
I rock a
Lawsuit when I'm going to court
A white suit when I'm getting divorced
A black suit at the funeral home
And my birthday suit when I'm home alone
Talking on the phone
Got an interview
With the Rolling Stone
They're saying
""Now you're rich and
Now you're famous
Fake-ass girls all know your name and
Lifestyles of the rich and famous
Your first hit aren't you ashamed?""
Of the life
Of the life
Of the life we're living

[Chorus]
I just wanna live
Don't really care about the things that they say
Don't really care about what happens to me
I just wanna live

[Verse 3]
""Stop your messing around, boy
Better think of your future
Better make some good plans, boy""
Said everyone of my teachers
Lookout!
You better play it safe
You never know what hard times will come your way
We say
Where we're coming from
We've already seen
The worst that this life can bring
Now we expect it everywhere that we go
All the things that they say
Yeah we already know

Don't really care about what happens to me

Over and over again play in my head

Cómo le encanta la gasolina (Dame más gasolina)
A ella le gusta la gasolina (Dame más gasolina)
Cómo le encanta la gasolina (Dame más gasolina)

[Verso 1]
Ella prende las turbinas, no discrimina
No se pierde ni un party de marquesina
Se acicala hasta pa' la esquina
Luce tan bien que hasta la sombra le combina
Asesina, me domina
Janguea en carros, motoras y limusinas
Llena su tanque de adrenalina
Cuando escucha reggaetón en las bocinas

[Coro: Daddy Yankee & Glory]
A ella le gusta la gasolina (Dame más gasolina)
Cómo le encanta la gasolina (Dame más gasolina)
A ella le gusta la gasolina (Dame más gasolina)
Cómo le encanta la gasolina (Dame más gasolina)

Tú hace' que cualquiera se enamore

Esto va pa' las gatas de to's colore'
Pa' las mayore', pa' las menore'
Pa' las que son más zorras que los cazadore'
Pa' las mujeres que no apagan sus motore'

Tenemos tú y yo algo pendiente

341,341,Trying To Find Atlantis,"I hear he's out there
Somewhere
Been looking for him everywhere
From Roswell to Timbuktu
I thought I found him once at a Jiffy Lube
But it turned in
To a dead end
So I got my oil changed and I tried again
He was a major in archaeology
I was digging on him but he wasn't on me
A girl trying to find herself the perfect man is
Like trying to find Atlantis

It's a mystery
Like the deep blue sea
You can take it
You can leave it
But I still believe
So I won't give up
And I won't give in
I know I'm gonna find him
I just don't know when
A girl trying to find herself the perfect man is
Like trying to find Atlantis

I met a mystic down in Memphis
We stood at the foot of the pyramid
He had me looking east
He had me looking west
Then he sold me a map and said I wish you the best
There was Elvis
Not the real one
When he told me goodbye he called me hon'
Just another shot in the dark
Like El Dorado or Noah's Ark
A girl trying to find herself the perfect man is
Like trying to find Atlantis

It's a mystery
Like the deep blue sea
You can take it
You can leave it
But I still believe
So I won't give up
And I won't give in
I know I'm gonna find him
I just don't know when
A girl trying to find herself the perfect man is
Like trying to find Atlantis

Oh yeah it is
It's a mystery
Like the deep blue sea
You can take it
You can leave it
But I still believe
So I won't give up
And I won't give in
I know I'm gonna find him
I just don't know when
A girl trying to find herself the perfect man is
Like trying to find Atlantis

I said a girl trying to find herself the perfect man is
Like trying to find Atlantis
Trying to find Atlantis
Yeah
Oh I'm still trying to find Atlantis
Atlantis

It's a mystery
Like the deep blue sea
You can take it
You can leave it
But I still believe
So I won't give up
And I won't give in
I know I'm gonna find him
I just don't know when
A girl trying to find herself the perfect man is

The money goes into my piggy bank
Clickity-clank, clickity-clank
The money goes into my piggy bank

[Intro]
Man I’ll get at you! My knife cuts your skin
I’ll get at you! Blow shots at your man
I’ll get at you! 2Pac don’t pretend
I’ll get at you! I’ll put that to an end

[Verse 1]
That damn shit is old, don’t be screamin’ “Get at Me Dog”
Have you runnin’ for your life when I match ya part
I get to wavin’ that semi like it’s legal
A lil’ nigga hurt his arm, lettin’ off that Eagle, you know me
Black on black Bentley, big ol’ black nine
I’ll clap your monkey-ass, yeah black on black crime
Big ol’ chrome rims gleam, you know how I shine
C’mon on man, you know how I shine
I’m in the hood, in the drop, Teflon vinyl top
Got a 100 guns, a 100 clips, why I don’t hear no shots?
That fat nigga thought “Lean Back” was “In da Club”
My shit sold eleven mill’, his shit was a dud
Jada’ don’t fuck with me, if you wanna eat
Cause I’ll do yo’ little ass like Jay did Mobb Deep
Yeah homey in New York niggas like your vocals
But that’s only New York dawg, yo’ ass is local

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Banks’ shit, sells; Buck’s shit, sells
Game’s shit, sells; I’m rich as hell
Shyne poppin’ off his mouth from a cell
He don’t want it with me, he in PC
I could have a nigga run up on him with a shank
For just a few pennies out my piggy bank
Yayo bring the condoms, I’m in Room 203
Freak bitch look like Kim before the surgery
It’s an emergency, for Michael Jackson see
Looked at a picture and says she looks like me
Kelis said her milkshake bring all the boys to the yard
Then Nas went, and tattooed the bitch on his arm
I mean like way out in Cali niggas know you, cuz
First thing they say about you is you’s a sucker for love
This is chess not checkers, these are warning shots
After your next move I’ll give you what I got

[Chorus]
Clickity-clank, clickity-clank

343,343,Why Do You Love Me,"[Verse 1]
I'm no Barbie doll
I'm not your baby girl
I've done ugly things
And I have made mistakes

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I am not as pretty as those girls in magazines
I am rotten to my core if they're to be believed
So what if I'm no baby bird hanging upon your every word?
Nothing ever smells of roses that rises out of mud

[Chorus]
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
It's driving me crazy
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
It's driving me crazy
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
It's driving me crazy
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?

[Verse 2]
You're not some little boy
Why you acting so surprised?
You're sick of all the rules
Well, I'm sick of all your lies

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Now I've held back a wealth of shit, I think I'm gonna choke
I'm standing in the shadows with the words stuck in my throat
Does it really come as a surprise when I tell you I don't feel good?
Nothing ever came from nothing, man
Oh man, ain't that the truth

[Chorus]
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
It's driving me crazy
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
It's driving me crazy
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
It's driving me crazy
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?

[Post-Chorus]
I get back up and I do it again
I get back up and I do it again
I get back up and I do it again
I get back up and I do it, I do it again

[Bridge]
I think you're sleeping with a friend of mine
I have no proof but I think that I'm right
And you've still got the most beautiful face
It just makes me sad most of the time

[Breakdown]
I get back up and I do it again
I get back up and I do it again
I get back up and I do it again
I get back up and I do it
I do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again

[Chorus]
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
It's driving me crazy
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
It's driving me crazy
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
It's driving me crazy

344,344,The Widow,"[Verse 1]
He's got fasting black lungs
Made of clove splintered shards
They're the kind that will talk
Through a wheezing of coughs
And I hear him every night, in every pore
And every time he just makes me warm

[Chorus]
Freeze without an answer
Free from all the shame
Must I hide? 'Cause I'll never, never sleep alone

[Verse 2]
Look at how they flock to him
From an isle of open sores
He knows that the taste is such
Such to die for
And I hear him every night on every street
The scales that do slither deliver me from

[Chorus]
Freeze without an answer
Free from all the shame
Then I'll hide, 'cause I'll never, never sleep alone

[Bridge]
Oh lord, said I'm, said I'm, said I'm
Said I'm, bloodshot for sure
Pale runs the ghost, said I'm, said I'm
Swollen on the shore, swollen on the shore
In every night, in every pore
The scales that do slither deliver me from

[Chorus]
Freeze without an answer
Free from all the shame
Then I'll hide, 'cause I'll never, never sleep alone
Freeze without an answer

345,345,"Awful, Beautiful Life","I woke up early this morning with a pounding in my head
I'd been out the night before with all my friends
A little worried, kinda wondering what i did
I said lord please forgive me for my sins
My wife wanted to kill me but she tried to save me first
You're going if i have to drag your butt to church

I love this crazy, tragic
Sometimes almost magic
Awful, beautiful life

I read the hymns and kinda sorta sang along
Made it throught the sunday sermon wide awake
We met the family for dinner at our home
Drank some beers, watched the game and cooked some steaks
My little brother had a big fight with his wife
My poor mother sat between them both all night

I love this crazy, tragic
Sometimes almost magic
Awful, beautiful life

We said a prayer for cousin micheal in iraq
We're all aware he may never make it back
We talked about the way we missed his stupid jokes
And how he wanted to be a soldier more than most

I laid in bed that night and thought about the day
And how my life was like a rollercoaster ride
The ups and downs and crazy turns along the way
It'll throw you off if you don't hold on tight
You can't really smile until you've shed some tears
I could die today or i might live on for years

I love this crazy, tragic
Sometimes almost magic
Awful, beautiful life

I love this crazy, tragic
Sometimes almost magic
Awful, beautiful life","['i', 'wake', 'up', 'early', 'this', 'morning', 'with', 'a', 'pound', 'in', 'my', 'head', 'id', 'be', 'out', 'the', 'night', 'before', 'with', 'all', 'my', 'friends', 'a', 'little', 'worry', 'kinda', 'wonder', 'what', 'i', 'do', 'i', 'say', 'lord', 'please', 'forgive', 'me', 'for', 'my', 'sin', 'my', 'wife', 'want', 'to', 'kill', 'me', 'but', 'she', 'try', 'to', 'save', 'me', 'first', 'youre', 'go', 'if', 'i', 'have', 'to', 'drag', 'your', 'butt', 'to', 'church', 'i', 'love', 'this', 'crazy', 'tragic', 'sometimes', 'almost', 'magic', 'awful', 'beautiful', 'life', 'i', 'read', 'the', 'hymn', 'and', 'kinda', 'sorta', 'sing', 'along', 'make', 'it', 'throught', 'the', 'sunday', 'sermon', 'wide', 'awake', 'we', 'meet', 'the', 'family', 'for', 'dinner', 'at', 'our', 'home', 'drink', 'some', 'beers', 'watch', 'the', 'game', 'and', 'cook', 'some', 'steaks', 'my', 'little', 'brother', 'have', 'a', 'big', 'fight', 'with', 'his', 'wife', 'my', 'poor', 'mother', 'sit', 'between', 'them', 'both', 'all', 'night', 'i', 'love', 'this', 'crazy', 'tragic', 'sometimes', 'almost', 'magic', 'awful', 'beautiful', 'life', 'we', 'say', 'a', 'prayer', 'for', 'cousin', 'micheal', 'in', 'iraq', 'be', 'all', 'aware', 'he', 'may', 'never', 'make', 'it', 'back', 'we', 'talk', 'about', 'the', 'way', 'we', 'miss', 'his', 'stupid', 'joke', 'and', 'how', 'he', 'want', 'to', 'be', 'a', 'soldier', 'more', 'than', 'most', 'i', 'lay', 'in', 'bed', 'that', 'night', 'and', 'think', 'about', 'the', 'day', 'and', 'how', 'my', 'life', 'be', 'like', 'a', 'rollercoaster', 'ride', 'the', 'up', 'and', 'down', 'and', 'crazy', 'turn', 'along', 'the', 'way', 'itll', 'throw', 'you', 'off', 'if', 'you', 'dont', 'hold', 'on', 'tight', 'you', 'cant', 'really', 'smile', 'until', 'youve', 'shed', 'some', 'tear', 'i', 'could', 'die', 'today', 'or', 'i', 'might', 'live', 'on', 'for', 'years', 'i', 'love', 'this', 'crazy', 'tragic', 'sometimes', 'almost', 'magic', 'awful', 'beautiful', 'life', 'i', 'love', 'this', 'crazy', 'tragic', 'sometimes', 'almost', 'magic', 'awful', 'beautiful', 'life']",261,Darryl Worley,Darryl Worley,2005,"[96, 89, 88, 85, 81, 67, 60, 44, 33, 30, 41, 49, 42]",13,Awful Beautiful Life,https://open.spotify.com/track/5uqbTKo8Ogq1sBQ3u940Xz,5uqbTKo8Ogq1sBQ3u940Xz,spotify:track:5uqbTKo8Ogq1sBQ3u940Xz,Darryl Worley,2mtjloY59apSHpZSkHoqv8,spotify:album:2mtjloY59apSHpZSkHoqv8,Darryl Worley,4zIBkSJcqRp4ADuFI94WvO,spotify:artist:4zIBkSJcqRp4ADuFI94WvO,232.8,12.0,42.0,2004-01-01,0.627,0.777,2.0,-6.91,1.0,0.0322,0.0189,1.09e-06,0.17300000000000001,0.643,112.59899999999999,"['contemporary country', 'country', 'country road', 'modern country rock']",[],1.0

347,347,Hope,"[Verse 1: Twista]
I wish the way I was living could stop, serving rocks
Knowing the cops is hot when I'm on the block, And I
Wish my brother woulda made bail
So I won't have to travel 6 hours to see him in jail, And I
Wish that my grandmother wasn't sick
Or that we would just come up on some stacks and hit a lick, And I (I wish)
Wish my homies wouldn't have to suffer
When the streets get the upper hand on us and we lose a brother, And I
Wish I could go deep in the zone
And lift the spirits of the world with the words within this song, And I (I wish)
Wish I could teach a could teach a soul to fly
Take away the pain out cha hands and help you hold them hi, And I
Wish My hommie Butch was still alive
And on the day of his death we had never took that ride, And I (I wish)
Wish that God could protect us from the wrong
So all the soldiers that were sent overseas come home
We would never break
Though they devastate
We shall motivate
And we gotta pray, all we got is faith
Instead of thinking about who gonna die to day
The Lord is gonna help you feel better, so you ain't gotta cry today
Sit at the light so long
And then we gotta move straight forward, cuz we fight so strong
So when right go wrong
Just say a little prayer, get ya money man, life goes on!!!
Let's HOPE!

[Chorus (Faith Evans)]
Though I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful! Hopeful and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay
'Cause we hopeful!

[VERSE 2 (Twista)]
I wish that you could show some love
Instead of hatin so much when you see some other people commin up (I wish)
I wish I could teach the world to sing
Watch the music and have 'em trippin of the joy I bring
I wish that we could hold hands
Listen instead of dissin lessons from a grown man, And I (I wish)
Wish the families that lack, but got love, get some stacks
Brand new shack and a lac' that's on dubs, And I
Wish we could keep achieving wonders
See the vision of the world through the eyes of Stevie Wonder, (you feel me) (I wish)
And I hope all the kids eat
And don't nobody in my family see six feet, (ya dig)
I hope them mothers stand strong
You can make it whether you with him or your mans gone, And I (I wish)
Wish I could give every celly some commissary
And the po po bring the heat on the peace like they did R. Kelly, And I
Wish that DOC could scream again
And bullets could reverse so Pac and Biggie breath again, (I wish)
That one day they could speak again
I wish that we only saw good news every time we look at CNN
I wish we could never get the blues
Wish I could bring back the people that died at E2*, (I wish)
I wish that we could walk a path, stay doin the right thing
Hustle hard so the kids maintain up in the game
Let's HOPE

[Chorus (Faith Evans)]
Though I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful, hopeful and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay
Cause we hopeful!

[VERSE 3 (Twista)]
Wish the earth wasn't so apocalyptic
I try to spread my message to the world the best way I can give it
We can make it always be optimistic
If you don't listen gotta live my life the best way that I can live it
I pray for justice when we go to court
Wish it was all good so the country wouldn't have to go to war
Why can't we kick it and just get em on
And in the famous words of Mr. King ""Why can't we all just get along""
Hope we can find a better way to shop and please, And I
Hope we find a better way to cop a keys, And I
Wish everybody would just stop and freeze
And ask way are we fulfilling these downfalls and these prophecies
You can be wrong if it's you doubting
With the faith of a mustard seed you can move mountains
And only the heavenly father can ease the hurt
Just let it go and keep prayin on your knees in church!!
And let's HOPE

[Chorus (Faith Evans) X2]
Though I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away,(let it take you away)

349,349,Monday Morning Church,"[Verse 1]
You left your Bible on the dresser
So I put it in the drawer
'Cause I can't seem to talk to God
Without yelling anymore
And when I sit at your piano
I can almost hear those hymns
The keys are just collecting dust
But I can't close the lid

[Chorus]
You left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church
It used to be so full of faith
And now it only hurts
And I can hear the devil whisper
""Things are only getting worse""
You left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church

[Verse 2]
The preacher came by Sunday
Said he missed me at the service
He told me Jesus loves me
But I'm not sure I deserve it
'Cause the faithful man that you loved
Is nowhere to be found
Since they took all that he believed
And laid it in the ground

[Chorus]
And left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church
It used to be so full of faith
And now it only hurts
And I can hear the devil whisper
""Things are only getting worse""
You left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church

[Bridge]
I still believe in Heaven
And I'm sure you've made it there
But as for me without your love, girl
I don't have a prayer

[Chorus]
You left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church
It used to be so full of faith
And now it only hurts
And I can hear the devil whisper
""Things are only getting worse""
You left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church

Fab: 5X
Can you be my B-A-B-Y?

M.S. : I'll never call another lover mine

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
And why would I, and why should I
When I seen a lady tonight, with my good eye that I would try and make
My..(baby..baby)
I was up in the club putting my hood high
When I saw you, and I stood by
Just lookin at your onion girl I could cry, and I could lie
I mean I could try and say you ain't sweep me off my feet
But only one thing could keep me off the street
And that's if you be my, B-A-B-Y
I can be why you always be fly
And I'm from B-Stuy, just like B.I...G. was, that's how F-A-B does
We can sip something 'til we both be buzzed
In a V-dub and that's only be-cause

[Hook: Mike Shorey]
Need someone to be my (baby)
Kind of girl you find in the club rockin those (baby) Phat jeans
Gonna find someone to be my (baby)
I see some ladies tonight that should be having my (baby, baby)

[Verse 2: Fab]
After the baby talk
The goo goo ga ga
You like this, that, you do bla bla
Couple good jokes, a few brouhaha's
It's time to do you, mama

First I'mma put you on your back
And make you scream out (baby)
Just like I put you on the track
Then I'mma lay you on your side
And slowly stroke you
While you telling me the way you feel inside

But my sex drive won't make me play you on the side
You know you get the keys any day you wanna ride
And my baby know how to start me up
You got the kind of kiss that'll speed a heartbeat up
And you got the kind of touch that'll gimme the chills

I ask you cuz I know you gonna gimme it real
It won't be fake
And don't we make a good couple
And won't we make a good...(baby)?

[Bridge: Mike Shorey]
Ooh, if I seem just a bit taken, pardon me
But you're so amazing
I just want us to do this exclusively
Say you'll be my baby

[Verse 3: Fab]
My baby's the only one I bring to the villa
That can get the bling and the scrilla
Girl, I know you smooth enough to spring a chinchilla
And still take a sting of Tequila

The way you swing is a thriller
I'm watching that like the boxing match in the ring of Manila
I wanna keep it comin like the singles of ""Thriller""
I mean if you still uh..my B-A-B-Y

351,351,I'm Not Okay (I Promise),"[Verse 1]
Well, if you wanted honesty
That's all you had to say
I never want to let you down
Or have you go, it's better off this way
For all the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
Remember when you broke your foot
From jumping out the second floor?

[Chorus]
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

[Verse 2]
What will it take to show you
That it's not the life it seems? (I'm not okay)
I've told you time and time again
You sing the words but don't know what it means (I'm not okay)
To be a joke and look
Another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook
For the last time, take a good hard look

[Chorus]
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Forget about the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
You said you read me like a book
But the pages all are torn and frayed

But you really need to listen to me
Because I'm telling you the truth
I mean this, I'm okay! (Trust me)

Like a cloud full of rain shouldn't hang in the sky
Ice shouldn't burn or a bumble bee fly
If you feel so happy, then why do you cry

A pearl in an oyster or a circus of fleas
Someone so perfect can't be fallin' for me
Oh nothin' 'bout love makes sense

You can win when you're losin'
Stand when you're fallin'

Wish I could explain it
But I don't know how

The reason we dream
That big Italian tower
Oh, how does it lean

Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, let's go

[Chorus]
(Huh huh huh hu-uh huh)
Ohhhhh! And they say, ohhhhh-ohhh
Oahhh-ohhhh (huh huh huh hu-uh huh), yeahhhh
Ohhhhh! And they say, ohhhhh-ohhh
Oahhh-ohhhh

[Verse 1]
Hold up, stop ma, let me get a look at'cha
Damn girl, I ain't seen you since prom
Come to think about it, can't believe it's been that long
I heard your man locked down now, how long he gone?
Oh that long? How the hell'd he get time like that
Three strikes with possession - aw he ain't coming back
He left you with two kids and bills all around
Plus you found out he had another chick 'cross town
It's always the darkest, ah-right before the sun rising
And you gotta stay strong, for the kids in they eyes and
And please don't despise, and go against all brothers
And have a hatred in your heart and take it out on another
I hate to sound 2Pac-ish lil' mama, but keep ya head up
But you gon' make it, I promise - you keep your head up
And that that don't kill you only makes you stronger
And the will to succeed'll only feed the hunger, f'real
F'real, f'real, hey

[Chorus]
(Huh huh huh hu-uh huh)
Ohhhhh! And they say, ohhhhh-ohhh
Oahhh-ohhhh (huh huh huh hu-uh huh), yeahhhh
Ohhhhh! And they say, ohhhhh-ohhh
Oahhh-ohhhh

[Verse 2]
I was at the gas station when a man walked past
With a sign ""will work for food, clothes or cash""
And he asked if he could pump my gas - so I let him
Clean the windshield and throw out the trash - so I let him
Hey, I even asked the brother his name
Where he was from, got kids man and what's they age
He kinda sturred for a second, he kinda looked surprise
That anyone would even take an interest in his life
He said, ""Young brother dem the only wurrds, I done hurrd, in the last yurr
That wasn't low or get the fuck away from hurr""
How could something so simple as general conversation
Mean much more than general conversation? Hey
You could tell life had beaten him down
Like he was in a title fight and this might be his last round
Sometimes the easiest things we take for granted
Until they gone, to realize we even had it, f'real
F'real, f'real, hey

[Chorus]
(Huh huh huh hu-uh huh)
Ohhhhh! And they say, ohhhhh-ohhh
Oahhh-ohhhh (huh huh huh hu-uh huh), yeahhhh
Ohhhhh! And they say, ohhhhh-ohhh
Oahhh-ohhhh

[Verse 3]
I used to think that life had a plan for me
Until I realized, life had to be planned by me
See that's the key, I only deal with what I can see
'Cause over history, mystery brought us nutting but misery
Man mo' people done died, in the name of the Lord
Than in any natural disaster, disease or gang war
Before guns there was swords, and they was killing each other
Ain't much changed since the days, we still killing each other
Killing our brothers while another mother cries for help
Man, we need to help a brother find himself
Feed him, life, ah-one-twoooo, three
Hey, that's something e'ry brother should see, and that's f'real
And that's f'real, and that's f'real, hey

[Chorus]
(Huh huh huh hu-uh huh)
Ohhhhh! And they say, ohhhhh-ohhh
Oahhh-ohhhh (huh huh huh hu-uh huh), yeahhhh
Ohhhhh! And they say, ohhhhh-ohhh
Oahhh-ohhhh

354,354,Goodies,"[Intro: Ciara]
My goodies, my goodies, my goodies
Not my goodies

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
I got a sick reputation for handling broads
All I need is me a few seconds or more
And it's a wrap
Tell valet to bring my 'Lac
And I ain't comin' back
So you can put a car right there (Put a car right there)
I'm the truth
And I ain't got nothin' to prove
And you can ask anybody
'Cause they seen me do it (They seen me do it)
Barricades, I run right through 'em
Used to 'em
Throw all the dirt you want, I'm used to it (It's no use)
You still won't have a pin-up in a fabulous room
On her back, picking out baskets of fruit
I love you, boo
Yeah, Freaky Petey love you too, ha-ha
You know how I do it (That goodie goodie)

[Pre-Chorus 1: Ciara]
You may look at me and think that I'm just a young girl
But I'm not just a young girl
Baby, this is what I'm looking for
Sexy, independent, gotta spend-it type that's gettin' his dough
I'm not being too dramatic
That's the way I gotta have it

[Chorus: Ciara]
I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Mad 'cause I talk around it
If you're looking for the goodies
Keep on looking, 'cause they stay in the jar
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah

[Verse 2: Ciara]
Just because you drive a Benz
I'm not goin' home with you
You won't get no nookie or the cookies
I'm no rookie
If you ain't sexy, independent I ain't wit' it
So you already know
I'm not bein' too dramatic
That's the way I gotta have it
You may talk slick
Tryna hit, but I'm not dumb
I'm not bein' too dramatic
It's just how I gotta have it

[Chorus: Ciara]
I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Mad 'cause I talk around it
If you're looking for the goodies
Keep on looking, 'cause they stay in the jar
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah

[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]
So damn hot, but so young
You ain't got milk on ya tongue
Slow down lil' one
And you ain't got it all
Hey shorty, you don't play the game (Wait a minute)
You think you bad, but you ain't bad
I'll show you what bad is
Bad is when you're capable of beatin' the baddest
I've been workin' at it ever since I came to this planet
I ain't quite there yet, but I'm gettin' better at it
Matter of fact
Lemme tell it to you one mo' 'gain
All I got to do is tell a girl who I am (Petey)
Ain't ne'er chick in here that I can't have
Bada boom, bada bam bam bam (I'm Bad)

[Pre-Chorus 2: Ciara]
You're insinuating that I'm hot
But these goodies boy, are not
Just for any of the many men that's tryna get on top
No, you can't call me later
And I don't want your number
I'm not changin' stories
Just respect the play I'm callin'!

[Chorus: Ciara]
I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Mad 'cause I talk around it
If you're looking for the goodies
Keep on looking, 'cause they stay in the jar
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah

I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Mad 'cause I talk around it
If you're looking for the goodies
Keep on looking, 'cause they stay in the jar

355,355,Some Beach,"[Verse 1]
Driving down the interstate
Running thirty minutes late
Singing Margaritaville and minding my own
Some foreign car driving dude with the road rage attitude
Pulled up beside me talking on his cell phone
He started yelling at me like I did something wrong
He flipped me the bird and then he was gone

[Chorus]
Some beach, somewhere
There's a big umbrella casting shade over an empty chair
Palm trees are growing and a warm breezes a blowing
I picture myself right there
On some beach, somewhere

[Verse 2]
I circled the parking lot trying to find a spot
Just big enough I could park my old truck
A man with a big cigar was getting into his car
I stopped and I waited for him to back up
But from out of nowhere a Mercedes Benz
Came cruising up and whipped right in

[Chorus 2]
Some beach, somewhere
There's nowhere to go when you got all day to get there
There's cold margaritas and hot señioritas smiling with long dark hair
On some beach, somewhere

[Verse 3]
I sat in that waiting room
It seemed like all afternoon
The nurse finally said doc's ready for you
You’re not going to feel a thing we'll give you some Novocain
That tooth will be fine in a minute or two
But he stuck that needle down deep in my gum
And he started drilling before I was numb

[Chorus 3]
Some beach, somewhere
There's a beautiful sunset burning up that atmosphere
There's music and dancing and lovers romancing

357,357,Welcome To My Life,"[Verse 1]
Do you ever feel like breaking down?
Do you ever feel out of place
Like somehow you just don't belong
And no one understands you?
Do you ever wanna run away?
Do you lock yourself in your room
With the radio on turned up so loud
That no one hears your screaming?

[Pre-Chorus]
No, you don't know what it's like
When nothing feels alright
You don't know what it's like
To be like me

[Chorus]
To be hurt, to feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no one's there to save you
No, you don't know what it's like
Welcome to my life

[Verse 2]
Do you wanna be somebody else?
Are you sick of feeling so left out?
Are you desperate to find something more
Before your life is over?
Are you stuck inside a world you hate?
Are you sick of everyone around?
With their big fake smiles and stupid lies
While deep inside you're bleeding

[Pre-Chorus]
No, you don't know what it's like
When nothing feels alright
You don't know what it's like
To be like me

[Chorus]
To be hurt, to feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no one's there to save you
No, you don't know what it's like
Welcome to my life

[Bridge]
No one ever lied straight to your face
And no one ever stabbed you in the back
You might think I'm happy, but I'm not gonna be okay
Everybody always gave you what you wanted
You never had to work, it was always there
You don't know what it's like, what it's like

[Chorus]
To be hurt, to feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no one's there to save you
No, you don't know what it's like (What it's like)
To be hurt, to feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no one's there to save you
No, you don't know what it's like

358,358,Shut Up,"[Verse 1]
There you go
You're always so right
It's all a big show
It's all about you
You think you know
What everyone needs
You always take time
To criticize me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It seems like everyday
I make mistakes
I just can't get it right
It's like I'm the one
You love to hate
But not today

[Chorus]
So shut up, shut up, shut up
Don't wanna hear it
Get out, get out, get out
Get out of my way
Step up, step up, step up
You'll never stop me
Nothing you say today
Is gonna bring me down

[Verse 2]
There you go
You never ask why
It's all a big lie
Whatever you do
You think you're special
But I know, and I know, and I know, and we know
That you're not

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You're always there to point
Out my mistakes
And shove them in my face
It's like I'm the one
You love to hate
But not today

[Chorus]
So shut up, shut up, shut up
Don't wanna hear it
Get out, get out, get out
Get out of my way
Step up, step up, step up
You'll never stop me
Nothing you say today
Is gonna bring me down
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Is gonna bring me down
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Will never bring me down

[Bridge]
Don't tell me who I should be (Don't tell me who I should be)
And don't try to tell me what's right for me
Don't tell me what I should do
I don't wanna waste my time
I'll watch you fade away

[Chorus]
So shut up, shut up, shut up
Don't wanna hear it
Get out, get out, get out
Get out of my way
Step up, step up, step up
You'll never stop me
Nothing you say today
Is gonna bring me down
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Don't wanna hear it
Get out, get out, get out
Get out of my way
Step up, step up, step up
You'll never stop me
Nothing you say is gonna bring me down

[Outro]
Bring me down (Shut up, shut up, shut up)
Won't bring me down

You can dress me up in diamonds
You can dress me up in dirt
You can throw me like a line-man
I like it better when it hurts

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I have waited here for you
I have waited

[Chorus]
You make me wanna la la
In the kitchen, on the floor
I'll be a french maid
When I meet you at the door
I'm like an alley cat
Drink the milk up, I want more
You make me wanna
You make me wanna, scream

[Verse 2]
You can meet me on an aeroplane
Or in the back of the bus
You can throw me like a boomerang
I'll come back and beat you up

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I have waited here for you
Don't keep me waiting

[Chorus]
You make me wanna la la
In the kitchen, on the floor
I'll be a french maid
When I meet you at the door
I'm like an alley cat
Drink the milk up, I want more
You make me wanna
You make me wanna la la
In the kitchen, on the floor
I'll be a french maid
When I meet you at the door
I'm like an alley cat
Drink the milk up, I want more
You make me wanna
You make me wanna, scream

[Bridge]
La la, la la, la la, la la
I feel safe with you
I can be myself tonight
It's alright, with you
'Cause you hold, my secrets tight
You do, you do

[Hook]
You make me wanna la la, la la la la la la, la la la la la, la la la
You make me wanna la la la la la

[Chorus]
You make me wanna la la

I'll be a french maid
When I meet you at the door
I'm like an alley cat
Drink the milk up, I want more
You make me wanna
You make me wanna la la
In the kitchen, on the floor
I'll be a french maid
When I meet you at the door

361,361,My Boo,"[Intro: Usher, Alicia Keys & Both]
There's always that one person that will always have your heart
You never see it coming 'cause you're blinded from the start
Know that you're that one for me, it's clear for everyone to see
Oh baby, ooh, yeah (You gotta rock away to this one)
You will always be my boo
See, I don't know 'bout y'all, but I know about us and, uh (Oh!)
It's the only way we know how to rock
I don't know 'bout y'all, but I know about us and, uh (Oh!)
It's the only way we know how to rock

[Verse 1: Usher]
Do you remember, girl?
I was the one who gave you your first kiss
'Cause I remember, girl
I was the one who said, ""Put your lips like this""
Even before all the fame
And people screaming your name
Girl, I was there when you were my baby

[Chorus: Usher & Alicia Keys]
It started when we were younger, you were mine (my boo)
Now another brother's taken over, but it's still in your eyes (my boo)
Even though we used to argue, it's alright (my boo)
I know we haven't seen each other in a while
But you will always be my boo
I was in love with you when we were younger, you were mine (my boo)
And I see it from time to time, I still feel like (my boo)
And I can see it no matter how I try to hide (my boo)And even though there's another man who's in my life
You will always be my boo

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys with Usher]
Yes, I remember, boy
'Cause after we kissed, I could only think about your lips
Yes, I remember, boy
The moment I knew you were the one I could spend my life with
Even before all the fame
And people screaming your name
I was there
And you were my baby

[Chorus: Usher & Alicia Keys]
It started when we were younger, you were mine (my boo)
Now another brother's taken over, but it's still in your eyes (my boo)
Even though we used to argue, it's alright (my boo)
I know we haven't seen each other in a while
But you will always be my boo
I was in love with you when we were younger, you were mine (my boo)
And I see it from time to time, I still feel like (my boo)
And I can see it no matter how I try to hide (my boo)
And even though there's another man who's in my life
You will always be my...

[Bridge: Usher & Alicia Keys]
Oh, my oh, my oh, my oh, my, my boo
My oh, my oh, my oh, my oh, my boo

[Chorus: Usher & Alicia Keys]
It started when we were younger, you were mine (my boo)
Now another brother's taken over, but it's still in your eyes (my boo)
Even though we used to argue, it's alright (my boo)
I know we haven't seen each other in a while
But you will always be my boo

[Outro: Usher]
I don't know about y'all, but I know about us and, uh
It's the only way we know how to rock
I don't know about y'all, but I know about us and, uh
It's the only way we know how to rock
It started when we were younger

362,362,He Gets That From Me,"[Verse 1]
His early morning attitude
You have to drag him out of bed
Only frosted flakes will do

[Hook 1]
He gets that from me
Yeah, he gets that from me

[Verse 2]
His curly hair and his knobby knees
The way the sun brings those freckles out
Talk and talk and never miss a beat

[Hook 1]
Yeah, he gets that from me
He gets that from me

[Chorus 1]
He looks at me with those big brown eyes
He's got me in the palm of his hands
And I swear sometimes
It's just like you're here again
He smiles that little crooked smile
There's no denying he's your child
Without him, I don't know what I'd do

[Hook 2]
He gets that from you
Oh, he gets that from you

[Chorus 2]
How he loves your old guitar
Yeah, he's taught himself to play
He melts my heart
Tells me he loves me every day
And cracks a joke at the perfect time
Makes me laugh when I want to cry
That boy is everything to me

[Hook 2]
He gets that from you
He gets that from you

[Verse 3]
Last night I heard him pray
""Lord, help me and Momma make it through
And tell Daddy we'll be okay""

[Hook 3]

He sure misses you
He really misses you

What an amazing time
What a family
How did the years go by?
Now it's only me

[Hook]
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock
Tick tock, tick tock
(La la la la la la la...)

[Verse 1]
Like a cat in heat stuck in a moving car
A scary conversation, shut my eyes, can't find the brake
What if they say that you're a climber?
Naturally I'm worried if I do it alone
Who really cares 'cause it's your life
You never know, it could be great
Take a chance 'cause you might grow
Oh, oh-oh

[Chorus]
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting for?
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting for?

[Post-Chorus]
Tick-tock, tick-tock
Tick-tock, tick-tock
Take a chance you stupid hoe

[Verse 2]
Like an echo pedal, you're repeating yourself
You know it all by heart, why are you standing in one place? (Uh-huh)
Born to blossom, bloom to perish
Your moment will run out 'cause of your sex chromosome
I know it's so messed up how our society all thinks (For sure)
Life is short, you're capable (Uh-huh)
Oh, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Look at your watch now
You're still a super hot female
You got your million dollar contract
And they're all waiting for your hot track!

[Chorus]
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting for?
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting for?

[Bridge]
I can't wait to go back and do Japan
Get me lots of brand new fans
Osaka, Tokyo
You Harajuku girls
Damn, you've got some wicked style... go!

[Pre-Chorus]
Look at your watch now
You're still a super hot female
You got your million dollar contract
And they're all waiting for your hot track!

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
Oooh!
I put it right there, made it easy for you to get to
Now you wanna act like ya don't know what to do
After I done everything that you asked me
Grabbed you, grind you, liked you, tried you
Moved so fast baby now I can't find you
Oooh!
I'm startin' to believe that I'm way too much for you
All that talk but it seems like it can't come through
All them lies like you could satisfy me
Now I see where believing you got me
Gave you the wheel, but you can't drive me

Oooh!
Two things I don't like when I tryin' to get my groove
Is a partna that meets me only half way and just can't prove
Take me out so deep when you know you can't swim
Need a lifeguard and I need protection
To put it on me deep in the right direction
Oooh!
You understand the facts that I'm tryin' to give to you
You movin' so slow like you just don't have a clue
Didn't mama teach you to give affection?
I know the difference of a man and an adolescent
It ain't you, boo, so get to steppin'!

Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my (Hah Hah)

Can you keep up?

Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath (Hah Hah)

If you can't make me say 'oooh'
Like the beat of this drum
Why you ask for some and you really want none
If you can't make me say 'oooh'
Like the beat of this groove

Baby you are dismissed, dismissed, dismissed....)

We'd hit the bottom
I thought it was my fault
In a way I guess it was
I'm just now finding out
What it was all about
Moved to the west coast
Away from everyone
She never told me that you called
Back when I was still
I was still in love

[Chorus]
Until I opened my eyes and walked out the door
And the clouds came tumbling down
And it's bye-bye
Goodbye, I tried
And I twisted it wrong
Just to make it right
Had to leave myself behind
I've been flying high all night
So come pick me up
I've landed

[Verse 2]
The daily dramas
She made from nothing
So nothing ever made them right
She liked to push me
And talk me back down
Until I believed
I was the crazy one
And in a way I guess I was

[Chorus]
But I opened my eyes and walked out the door
And the clouds came tumbling down
And it's bye-bye
Goodbye, I tried
Treading the sea of a troubled mind
Had to leave myself behind
Singing bye-bye
Goodbye, I tried
If you wrote me off
I'd understand it
Because I've been on
Some other planet
So come pick me up
I've landed

[Bridge]
And you will be so
Happy to know
I've come alone
It's over

[Chorus]
But I opened my eyes and walked out the door
And the clouds came tumbling down
And it's bye-bye
Goodbye, I tried
Down comes the reign of the telephone czar
It's okay to call
And I will answer for myself

Come pick me up

[R KELLY (ASHANTI)]
If it wasn't for the money, cars and movies stars and jewels
And all these things I got
I wonder, hey
Would you still want me (Want you)
Would you still be calling me (Still calling you)
You be loving me? (I'll be loving you)
[JA RULE]
Wanna keep you flawed with no dough
Pimpin ain't easy
Trust me I know
When gangstas and hoes
Go go go go go go together
Like chinchilla and bad weather
I'm good but been better
All my bros, chedda and glamorous things
Copped a few cars
A crib with a east and west wing
Cuz this is how I'm livin and yall women know the secrets
Of how to get it and keep it
How to prey on my weakness
Cuz its the power of the want the p-u-s-s-y
Got a lotta niggas wonderin it ain't just i
Gotta keep ya cash comin and that's on my life
If it wasn't for the money and the things I got
Shit, she probably wouldn't like me
But I keep her and irv and jeffrey quite icy
Sip seraphin
Who doesn't like me
And the murderous I-n-c

[Chorus]
[R KELLY]
How many girls does it take to get to
Mack status
Player status
Pimps that get
Ya boy half rich before we hit show biz
But show biz brought next level chicks
Pull them in them hot cars go buy the whole bar nigga
I came from the dirt what you want me to say
I'm at the top of the world and life's a pussy buffet
And that's why I get m-i-a
Shut the game down so the bustas can't play
Hell yeah I splurge money
Hell yeah I act funny
Look at you like fuck you
All the shit I been through
It's a wonder why I'm still here (God)
Said I was gone but I'm still here (God)
And all you bitches that left me here (Oh)
Its mighty strange how you right back here

[Chorus]

I wonder why love is about money
And why wou wanna take it all from me
Honey
My life is dark but its lovely
Crimes cars cribs ain't that right kelly?
(oh oh oh oh oh)
Yall bitches don't know
Money ain't a thang
Mami need a lil change
Girl I'm pitchin quarters
Closest to the arches but live in a fortress
New benzes new porsches
New cases new lawyers
I'm becoming the infamous notorious rule
Niggas couldn't walk a mile in my shoes
Niggas don't possess the heart that I do
And it's a wonder that I'm still here (god)
Thought I was gone but I'm still here (god)
And all you bitches that left me here (oh)
Its kinda funny how you right back there (oh oh oh)

367,367,We Will Become Silhouettes,"[Verse 1]
I've got a cupboard with cans of food
Filtered water, and pictures of you
And I'm not coming out until this is all over
And I'm looking through the glass
Where the light bends at the cracks
And I'm screaming at the top of my lungs
Pretending the echoes belong to someone
Someone I used to know

[Chorus]
And we become
Silhouettes when our bodies finally go

[Verse 2]
I wanted to walk through the empty streets
And feel something constant under my feet
But all the news reports recommended that I stay indoors
Because the air outside will make
Our cells divide at an alarming rate
Until our shells simply cannot hold all our insides in
And that's when we'll explode
And it won't be a pretty sight

[Chorus]
And we'll become
Silhouettes when our bodies finally go
And we'll become (And we'll become, and we'll become)
Silhouettes when our bodies finally go
And we'll become (And we'll become, and we'll become)
Silhouettes when our bodies finally go
And we'll become (And we'll become, and we'll become)
Silhouettes when our bodies finally go

Sh sh sh, Shady! Aftermath, haha!
G G G G-Unit! Haha!

[Nakarat: 50 Cent & Eminem]

Çünkü bu partiyi doğru sete koymaya geldik
Hadi geri dönelim bu gece!
Ve eğer en öne geçmemize izin vermezlerse;
Biz yan taraftan dolanacağız
Çünkü bu oyundan asla çıkmak istemiyorum
En azından ''Güle güle'' demeden önce..
Yani, solumda ki bütün hayranlarım
Ve sağımdaki bütün hayranlarım; son bir kez sallayıııın!


[Giriş: Eminem]
Doktor için kıçınızı kaldırın! Son bir kez dahaaa
Doktor için kıçını kaldır, hadi şuan da!
Işte gidiyoruz, çekişme, bu başka bir ''club banger!''
Koltuk kenarlarında oturun,  aşağıya iniiin

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & Eminem]

Zaman doldu, oyun bitti, kaybettin, ben kazandım!
Burada, bu salaklara nasıl karşılaştığımızı göster
Oh evet, yeni yıl, bir sonraki aşama başlıyor..
Bakın kim var(?)  sen yine deliriyorsun
Ben bir trendim, her girişimde bir tane ayarlıyorum
Dışarı çıkıyorum ve tam bir daire ile geri geliyorum
Sen heveslisin, bu zaten sahip olduğumuz bir şey anlamına geliyor
Ama sen gittikten sonra geri dönemeyeceksin

Çok kötü, şimdi haritadan çıktın ve radar seni bulamıyor bile
Öğütmeye devam ediyoruz, sen kay, seni dışarı öğütüyoruz
Sinirle etrafta dolanıyorsun, öfkenin seni kör etmesine izin veriyorsun
Sadece oyun oynuyoruz, keman sesleri arkandalar
Tüm sidik ve iniltiler şarap içip şikayet etmek için yeterli
Otur ve gözlemle, dinleyin, eğer dikkatini verirsen öğreneceksin
Neden 10 multi-platin albümden sonra 3 elmas ?!
Dünya çapında, tek mermiyle grafiklerdeyiz ve hala tırmanıyoruz..

[Nakarat: 50 & Eminem]

Çünkü bu partiyi doğru sete koymaya geldik
Hadi dans edelim bu gece!
Ve eğer, en öne geçmemize izin vermezler ise;
Biz yan taraftan dolanacağız ..
Çünkü bu oyundan asla çıkmak istemiyorum
En azından ''güle güle'' demeden önce..
Yani, solumda ki bütün hayranlarım ve sağımda olanlar
Son bir kez daha sallayın!

[Tanıtım: Eminem, 50 ve Doctor]

Dr Dre ''Delirin'' dediğinde delireceksin

DELİRİN!  DELİR!  DELİR!  DELİR!

Ve 50 Cent ''Zıplayın'' dediğinde
Tek ayağını kaldır ve zıpla

ZIPLA!  ZIPLA!  ZIPLA!  ZIPLA!

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre & Eminem]

Uğultu muazzam! Hepinizi hissetmek için düşüyoruz
Onu teşvik etmem gerekmiyor çünkü Doc 'un bench 'in dışında olduğunu biliyorsunuz

Partiyi menteşelerinden sürdürüyoruz
Gösteriş yapmayacağız, sadece popüler fikir birliğine gidiyoruz

Ancak eleştirmenler Doc 'un yumuşak olduğunu söylüyor, o konuşuyor;
Doctor hepsini yıkamış, becermiş, Doc' un lanet izlenimi kimdir?
Doctor bu, doctor o, yanlış izlenime sahipsin!
Doc un horozunda olmalısın çünkü doc hepinizi tatmin ediyordu
Bu yüzden DJ, iğneyi al ve sadece plağın üzerine bırak. Ne?!
Biz sıçrayacak ve bu orospu çocuğuna ikinci kez vuracağız, Vur! (bam-bam)
İşte bu yüzden daima sondaki en iyi kesimden tasarruf ediyoruz
Size Scratch yaptıracak ve kaşıntı yapacak taze kesilmiş çimler gibi

Çünkü biz köpekbalıkları ile yüzdük, timsahlarla güreştik
Kızgın genç nesil için konuşuyoruz
Kimse rap için köprü olmasaydı eğer
Boşluklar ırkçı yetiştirmek için yükseltilirdi
Yüzlerimizi hiç görmemiş olabilir
Rolling Stone sayfalarının kapaklarını derecelendirdi
Dil ve ırk bariyerlerini aştı
Sadece pelerinli haçlıları ara ve ben ve Dre 'ye bırak
Mikrofona geçmek için bütün gün ileri-geri oynayabiliriz
''Hot patato'' oyunu gibi işte bu yüzden geldik ...

[Nakarat: 50 Cent & Eminem]

Çünkü bu partiyi doğru sete koymaya geldik
Hadi dans edelim bu gece!
Ve eğer, en öne geçmemize izin vermezler ise;
Biz yan taraftan dolanacağız ..

En azından ''güle güle'' demeden önce..
Yani, solumda ki bütün hayranlarım ve sağımda olanlar
Son bir kez daha sallayın!

[Tanıtım: Eminem]

50 Cent, hadi!

[Verse 3: 50 Cent, Dr. Dre & Eminem]

Şimdi dans edin, ellerinizi kaldırın, nasıl yaptığımızı biliyorsun
Gittiğimiz her yerde klübün sıçramasını sağlıyoruz
Bu bir sır değil, herkes biliyor..
Dre işin içine dahil ise çok fazla para var!

Ve bolca bal içeren güneşli bir pazar ile palmiye ağaçları
California! Sadece her gün başka bir parti
Vadilerden onlara dek gidiyor, tüm 8 Mile sokakları

Hadi Ralli yapalım! Büyük final için ellerini kaldır
Şimdi koltuğunu yükselt dr dre konuşuyor
Bir kilo otu yakıp haftanın altı gününe karıştır

Beni stüdyoda yakalayabilirsin
Beat ritimleri sana sunmak için vuruyor
Isıyla birlikte hoparlörlerinizi yakmaya devam ediyor

Yani asla ''Asla'' deme çünkü Shady / Aftermath birlikte!
G-unit Records hediyeler ile birlikte
Doc ve Shady'nin dönüşünü sunuyor
Hiç kimse daha iyisini yapamaz, bu klübü yıkıyoruz!
Ve bir parça delil bırakmadan ayrılıyoruz ..

Çünkü bu partiyi doğru sete koymaya geldik
Hadi geri dönelim bu gece!
Ve eğer en öne geçmemize izin vermezlerse;
Biz yan taraftan dolanacağız
Çünkü bu oyundan asla çıkmak istemiyorum
En azından ''Güle güle'' demeden önce..
Yani, solumda ki bütün hayranlarım
Ve sağımdaki bütün hayranlarım;
Son bir kez salla - yıııın!

[Outro: Eminem & 50 Cent]

Evet, haha! Hala AFTERMATH, 2006!
Ve ''Detox'' albümü hakkında endişelenmeyin, o geliyor ..
Dre'nin yaptığını yapıyoruz! Hahaha! 50 Cent!
G-Unit, Obie Trice, D-Twizzy, Stat Quo, Dr Dre!
Biz ayrılmayacağız, hadi gidelim, haha! Bayanlar ve baylar
Geldiğiniz için hepinize teşekkürler! Barış!

*Eminem 'in ismini haykırıyorlar*

*Ayak sesleri*

Ha siktir! Neredeyse unutuyordum..

*Kızlar Eminem 'in silah çektiğini görünce çığlık atıyor*

Sen benimle birlikte geliyorsun!

*Eminem silahın horozunu çeker ve seyircilere ateş etmeye başlar*

*İnsanlar korkarak çığlık atmaya ve koşmaya başlar*

* Silah atışları ve vurulmalar *

Haha haa, Bye, bye!

Don't you remember
The fizz in a pepper
Peanuts in a bottle
At ten, two and four
A fried bologna sandwich
With mayo and tomato
Sittin' round the table
Do not happen much anymore

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We got too complicated
It's all way over-rated
I like the old and out-dated
Way of life

[Chorus]
Back when a ho was a ho
Coke was a Coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said I am down with that
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when

[Verse 2]
I love my records
Black, shiny vinyl
Clicks and pops
And white noise
Man they sounded fine
I had my favorite stations
The ones that played 'em all
Country, soul and rock-n-roll
What happened to those times

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I am reading Street Slang For Dummies
'Cause they put pop in my country
I want more for my money
The way it was back then

[Chorus]
Back when a ho was a ho
Coke was a Coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said I am down with that
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when

[Bridge]
Give me a flat top for strummin'
I want the whole world to be hummin'
Oh, just keep it comin'
The way it was back then

[Chorus]
Back when a ho was a ho
Coke was a Coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said I am down with that
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when

Unos, dos, tres, catorce!
(Turn it up loud, captain)

[Verse 1]
Lights go down, it's dark, the jungle is your head
Can't rule your heart, a feeling so much stron-
-ger than a thought, your eyes are wide and though your soul
It can't be bought, your mind can wander

[Chorus]
Hello, hello! (¡Hola!)
I'm at a place called Vertigo (¿Dónde está?)
It's everything I wish I didn't know
Except you give me something
I can feel
Feel

[Verse 2]
The night is full of holes as bullets rip the sky
Of ink with gold, they twinkle as the boys
Play rock and roll, they know that they can't dance
At least they know
I can't stand the beats, I'm asking for the cheque
The girl with crimson nails has Jesus round her neck
Swinging to the music, swinging to the music
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Hello, hello! (¡Hola!)
I'm at a place called Vertigo (¿Dónde está?)
It's everything I wish I didn't know

Checkmated!
Just fun!
She made it in, yeah!

All of this, all of this can be yours
All of this, all of this can be yours
Just give me what I want and no-one gets hurt

[Final Chorus]
Hello, hello! (¡Hola!)
We're at a place called Vertigo (¿Dónde está?)
Lights go down and all I know
Is that you give me something
I can feel your love teaching me how
Your love is teaching me how
How to kneel
Kneel

That would ever bring a tear to your eye
I've never crossed the line
Or needed an alibi to cover up a lie
But darling I'll admit
There've been times when I could have
The thing that kept me strong
Is the one thing that is always on my mind

[Chorus]
When I think about cheatin'
I just think about you leavin'
And how my world would fall to pieces
If I tossed your love away
Even when I'm tempted by some stranger
Oh there's never any danger
I just think about you leavin'
When I think about cheatin'

There was a time in Abilene
When he said all the things I wanted to hear
It was hard to turn him down
Between the champagne and the sound of whispers in my ear
But it just took one two-step with someone, and I was missing you
He never had a chance, cause I broke up the dance
Before the song was through

This is, this is...
This is, this is...
I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips

[Chorus: Ja Rule]
I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips
Nigga I'm from New York (New York)
I got a semi-automatic that spits
Next time if you talk (you talk)
I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips
Nigga I'm from New York (New York)
I got a semi-automatic that spits
Next time if you talk (you talk)
(And I know)

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
Y'all niggas is pussy, punani, vagina
Your monologue's getting tired, now it's time to ride
Apprentice you're fired, you're no longer desired
So take off them silly chains, put back on your wire
I'm on fire; Harley dipped in octane
Let East Coast bang, let West Coast bang
And Rule gon' bring the ghetto gospel
To every hood possible, pushing through in the sky blue
Back with the Gods, you now, preferably the four pound
Slugs flying at the speed of sound
Tryin to catch the ears of niggas that's running their mouths
I might get my Brooklyn niggas to run in your house
I don't really understand what the running's about
But we're hunters, we take pride in airing our prey out
Leaving 'em layed out, dead, in just a sport
'Cause we ain't playing up here in New York

[Chorus: Fat Joe]
I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips
Nigga, I'm from New York (New York)
And you can tell the way the homie spit
That nigga, I'm from New York (New York)
I got a hundred ways to make a grip
Yes, I'm from New York (New York)
And you can tell I get real ignorant
'Cause nigga, I'm from New York (New York)
(And this is how we do)

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Nigga, I can see the coke in your nose
This ain't a movie, even he got his head blown on the globe
And I was just about to find God
But now that Ma$e is back, I think I'd much rather find a menage
And everybody talking crazy how they're AK spit
But we done did some investigating, and they ain't spray shit
Not me, I'm the truth, homie, got the industry shook like
""Naw, nigga, Joe gon' let 'em loose on me""
True Story, I'm bringing the T back
Even Roy Jones was forced to Lean Back
My nigga Dre said, ""grind, Cook""
Now we killing them hard
Niggas said I must've found Pun's rhyme book
Got bitches on top of the Phantom
And the pinky got bling, like the ring around Saturn
Cook Coke Crack, niggas fiend for that
And you already know the X is where the team be at, uhh

[Chorus: Jadakiss]
I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips
Nigga, I'm from New York (New York)
Ruff Ryde, and D-Block and shit
Nigga, fuck what you thought (you thought)
And you can't take shit for granted
'Cause life is too short (too short)
I got a hundred guns, a hundred clips
Nigga, I'm from New York
(HA-HAAAEEH! And this is how we do)

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
I swear it couldn't be sweeter, life's a bitch
Depending on how you treat her, you might get rich
It's guaranteed you gon' die, you might get missed
For maybe two or three hours, 'til they light they spliffs
And that coke will get you a long time
But when I let 'em know the dope is out, it's like America Online
Wise has awoken, and you know they say that you deserved it
Whenever you die with your eyes open
I still hold the title, 'cause I'm in the hood
Like them little motorcycles
Stick up kids hoppin' out with them old rifles
Just doing shit for nothin', it's so spiteful, ha, I'm just like you
Word that niggas wanna murk you is in the air
A double shot of 'gac and the purple is in the air
And I'm not cocky, I'm confident
So when you tell me I'm the best it's a compliment
HA-HAAAEEH!

[Chorus/Outro: Ja Rule, Fat Joe, (Jadakiss) & All]

She pullin up her skirt, tryna show a nigga somethin
The car cloudy, my niggas all rowdy
This Hennessey den got a nigga drowsy, I'm outtie
Now where them hoes at, look I'm tryna take you home
So what you got ya girlfriend's, bitch bring 'em on
Oh I'm tryna break a bone, when I get in them drawls
To the window! - to the mothafuckin walls
What a nigga don't know won't hurt him
So if you got a old man, bitch I ain't worried
And I got plenty room, if you think you wanna roll

Get ya ass on this bike, I could show you I'mma rider

Giovanni rims, wit Perelli's on the tires
They said 22's wouldn't fit, but they liars
We could take a trip to the hood and back
And we could go and get a room, how hood is that
What'cha waitin on shorty, this a chance of ya ife
What I mean, what I see, in them jeans, what I like
You don't know what you missin, just quit talkin and listen
See I'm holdin up traffic, we just right here sittin
Think about it for I bounce, and you holla I'm wrong
And you see ya best friend, in this Impala on chrome
If you ballin, and ya money long, you can relate
But all them broke ass niggas gon' hate

374,374,Down And Out,"[Produced by Kanye West and Brian Miller]

[Intro: Cam'ron & Kanye West]
Uh, Killa! Baby!
Kanye, this that 1970s Heron flow, huh?
Yeah, let's speed it up
Ugh, I'm back in, ugh, ugh
They don't know we finna kill the game this year
Killa! 'Ye! C'mon!

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Ayo, street mergers I legislated, the nerve I never hated
On murders premeditated, absurd! I hesitated
Observe: cock and spray, hit you from a block away
Drinking sake on a Suzuki; we in Osaka Bay
Playing soccer, stupid, stay in a sucker's place
Pluck ya ace, take ya girl, fuck her face
She dealing with Killa so you love her taste
She swallowing Killa cause she love the taste
I got brought up with crooking, kitchen orders that I'm cooking
But got caught up with the juxes
You would've thought I was from Brooklyn
It gets boring just looking
Did like Bill Cosby, pouring in the pudding
Now the dashboard is wooden from a hard-tangled grammar
Interior, inferior, Star-Spangled Banner
Car game bananas, mob manning tanners
Guns everywhere, like the car came with hammers, he's back

[Chorus: Kanye West & (Syleena Johnson)]
They trying to say he (I'm down, down)
I hear niggas saying he (I'm down, but not out)
But our flow is the truest (Oh)
The game's in the nooses (No no)
Our girls is the models (Oh)
They coochies the juiciest (Ooooh)
Yeah, they say he (I'm down, down)
Yeah, they say he (I'm down, but not out)
'Cause I'm back on my grind (Oh)
Money back on my mind (No no)
Ye' and Killa Cam', the world is mine (Oooh)

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
I treat bitches straight up, like Simon Says
Open vagina: put ya legs behind ya head
Cop me Air Ones, hon, lime and red
You got pets? Me too: mines are dead, doggy
Fox, minks, gators, that's necessary
Accessories, my closet's ""Pet Sematary""
I get approached by animal activists
I live in a zoo, I run scandals with savages
All my niggas get together to gather loot
Bodyguard for what? Dog, I'd rather shoot
I go to war, old Timbs, battered boots
Hand grenade, goggles and a parachute
Y'all don't even know the name of my flip
It was Touch Me, Tease Me when Case was the shit
You don't know bout the cases I get:
Court case, briefcase, suitcase, cases of Cris', aaow!

[Chorus: Kanye West & (Syleena Johnson)]
They trying to say he (I'm down, down)
I hear niggas saying he (I'm down, but not out)
But our flow is the truest (Oh)
The game's in the nooses (No no)
Our girls is the models (Oh)
They coochies the juiciest (Ooooh)
Yeah, they say he (I'm down, down)
Yeah, they say he (I'm down, but not out)
'Cause I'm back on my grind (Oh)
Money back on my mind (No no)
Ye' and Killa Cam', the world is mine (Oooh)

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Uh, Killa, yo, yo...
Ayo you dealing with some sure shit, my bitches pure thick
Play razor tag, slice ya face, you're it!
It's I who come by drive-thru
Gator-toed Mauri, three quarters, sky blue
Look at mami: eyes blue, 5'2''
I approached her ""Hi boo, how you?
Pony skin Louis? Oh, you fly too
You a stewardess? Good ma, I fly too""
Now a nigga got baking to bake
Harlem Shake? Nah, I'm in Harlem shaking the weight
Shaking to bake, shaking the Jakes
Kill you, shoot the funeral up and Harlem Shake at your wake
Just ya picture though, you still taped in a lake
I'm laughing; you couldn't wait to escape
For anyone who owed the dough, I had to load the fo'
I hope a nigga heard when I said ""I told you so""
Uh, Killa

[Chorus: Kanye West & (Syleena Johnson)]
They trying to say he (I'm down, down)
I hear niggas saying he (I'm down, but not out)
But our flow is the truest (Oh)
The game's in the nooses (No no)
Our girls is the models (Oh)
They coochies the juiciest (Ooooh)
Yeah, they say he (I'm down, down)
Yeah, they say he (I'm down, but not out)
'Cause I'm back on my grind (Oh)
Money back on my mind (No no)
Ye' and Killa Cam', the world is mine (Oooh)

[Outro: Cam'ron]
Mine! Killa!
You already know Harlem
Whole Midwest, Detroit, Naptown, St. Louis
Chicago, of course
Westside, holla at me
Southside, wild hundreds
You know what it is, Ohio

375,375,Pain,"[Verse 1]
I don't feel the way I've ever felt
I know
Going to smile and not get worried
I try but it shows

[Pre-Chorus]
Anyone can make what I have built and better now
Anyone can find the same white pills
It takes my pain away

[Chorus]
It's a lie, a kiss with opened eyes
And she's not breathing back
Anything but bother me
(It takes my pain away)
Never mind, these are horrid times
Oh, oh, oh
I can't let it bother me

[Verse 2]
I never thought I'd walk away from you
I did
But it's a false sense of accomplishment every time I quit

[Pre-Chorus]
Anyone can see my every flaw
It isn't hard
Anyone can say they're above this all
It takes my pain away

[Chorus]
It's a lie, a kiss with open eyes
And she's not breathing back
Anything but bother me
(It takes my pain away)
Never mind these are hurried times
Oh, oh, oh
I can't let it bother me

I can't let it bother me
It takes my pain away

[Chorus]
It's a lie, a kiss with opened eyes
And she's not breathing back
Anything but bother me
(It takes my pain away)
Never mind, these are hurried times
Oh, oh, oh
I can't let it bother me

Takes my pain
Takes my pain

Pow! One to the head, now you know he dead

Ay, it's Cash Money Records, man, a lawless gang

Birdman, put them niggas in the trash can
Leave 'em outside of your door, I'm your trash man

You will need a gas mask, man
You snakes, stop hiding in the grass
Sooner or later I'll cut it, now the blade's in your ass
You homo niggas getting AIDS in the ass
While the homie here tryna get paid in advance
I'm staying on my grizzy, I'm a bona fide hustler
Play me or play with me, then I'm gonna find your mother
Niggas wanna eat, 'cause they ain't ate nothin'
But niggas wanna leave when you say you out of mustard
So I'ma walk into the restaurant alone
Leaving out, leaving behind just residue and bones
In your residence with Rugers to your dome
Like, ""Where the fuck you holding the coke?""
Holding your throat, choke

Let's go, uh huh

[Hook: Mariah Carey/Jadakiss]
K-i-s-s- me
Uh and I just wanna make..
Love, love, love
Yeah, I love it when you say
K-i-s-s me
Uh and I just wanna make
Love, love, love

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
A yo.. the crib got your friends working
We travel to France for french curtains
You was there when I was on the bench hurtin'
Now that I own my team
Its only right that I condone my queen
Try to show her my dream
And I can't let her get lost now
She carries the money, the hammer, and material across town
And understand she fine
Understand she mine
She understand the grind
Cooks, clean, and irons
And whatever shes wanna push I'mma cosign
And if I ain't got it already than I'mma go find it
I guess I'mma lucky don, and shes a lucky queen
Cause her jewelry box look likes Lucky Charms
All color stones
And she know that I'm in the hood, but she also knows that I'm coming home
Mr. Raspy, thought I was in love with money
'Til the first time we getting nasty

[Hook: Mariah Carey/Jadakiss]

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Uh yo, Whatever the road to paradise is we on it
Gave you your income tax checks so I can get on with
Those were the days, these are the times
You held me down with nearly damn near everything, even my rhymes
I will play a song for you
And you will let me know exactly how the ladies will respond from a womens
Point of view
And that's why my girl is with me
I love it when she layin' in the bed with a Pearl Long Vickie
The next best thing to a soldier
Go hard with a fat ass and a head full of rollers
Just look in her eyes and tell she's real
Just imagine the way she smell and the way she feel
The sex was crazy then and crazy still
And you know I'm from the streets so its crazy ill
And we waiting on the new island
We been to all them 4, 5 times come on mommy you whilin

[Hook: Mariah Carey/Jadakiss]

[Bridge: Jadakiss/Mariah Carey]
When things was ruff only person I could call was you
Now everything I do I do it all 4 you

Come touch me, come kiss me, come love me neway you wanna boy

N I'm hood as long as I'm close to you
N we doing wut grown folks is suppose to do

Come hold me, come feel me, come take me anyway you wanna baby

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
A yo the money is great but what we got is more better
We got the four letters when it comes from the heart its more pleasure
And for the fact that you trust me still
Thus far I appreciate what we build
All the minks that I bought you that dragged the floor
And all the nights you sat up and bagged the roar
Damn I'm thinking that you gotta hate it
But yet and still you tolerate it
That's why ma we gotta make it

381,381,Just Lose It,"[Intro: Eminem]
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, okay!
Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright, stop… pajama time!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Come here, little kiddies! On my lap!
Guess who's back with a brand new rap?
And I don't mean ""rap"" as in a new case
Of child molestation accusations
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, no worries
Papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I done touched on everything but little boys
And that's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bung-hole
And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know; who'd hear it?
Give a little ""poot poot,"" it's okay
(*fart*) Oops, my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now, I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl… girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it! (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!)
Just lose it! (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!)
Go crazy! (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!)
Oh, baby (Ah, ah-!) oh, baby, baby (Ah, ah-!)

[Bridge 1: Eminem]
Well, it's Friday and it's my day
Just to party all the way 'til Sunday
Maybe 'til Monday, I don't know what day
Every day's just a holiday
Cruisin' on the freeway, feelin' kinda breezy
Let the top down and my hair blow
I don't know where I'm goin', all I know is
When I get there someone's gonna touch my body

[Verse 2: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
'Scuse me, miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out? (Yeah)
Now, what's your name, girl? What's your sign?
Man, you must be up out your mind!
Dre (ah, aA), be-!e,r goggles, blind
I'm just tryin' to unwind, now I'm…

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now, I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl… girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it! (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!)
Just lose it! (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!)
Go crazy! (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!)
Oh, baby (Ah, ah-!) oh, baby, baby (Ah, ah-!)

[Bridge 2: Eminem]
Well, it's Tuesday and I'm locked up
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was runnin' butt-naked
Down the street screamin', (Ah, ah, ah, ah!)
Your honor, I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much, I'm not guilty
They said, ""Save it, boy, we got you on tape
Yellin' at an old lady to touch my body!""

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back, and everybody lose themselves
Now snap back to reality; look, it's B. Rabbit!
""Yo, you signed me up to battle? I'm a grown man!""
Chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubby
I don't have any lines to go right here, so chubba Teletubby
Fellas! (What?) Fellas! (What?)
Grab your left nut, make your right one jealous (what?)
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls
Tall girls, small girls, I'm calling all girls
Everyone report to the dance floor
It's your chance for a little romance or
Butt-squeezin', it's the season
Just go, (Ah, ah, ah, ah-!); it's so appeasin'

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now, I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl… girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it! (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!)
Just lose it! (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!)
Go crazy! (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!)
Oh, baby (Ah, ah!) oh, baby, baby (Ah, ah!)

382,382,Holy Water,"Somewhere there's a stolen halo
I use to watch her wear it well
Everything would shine wherever she would go
But looking at her now you'd never tell

Someone ran away with her innocence
A memory she can't get out of her head
I can only imagine what she's feeling
When she's praying
Kneeling at the edge of her bed

And she says take me away
Then take me farther
Surround me now
And hold, hold, hold me like holy water
Holy water

She wants someone to call her angel
Someone to put the light back in her eyes
She's looking through the faces
And unfamiliar places
She needs someone to hear her when she cries

And she says take me away
Then take me farther
Surround me now
And hold, hold, hold me like holy water
Holy water

She just needs a little help
To wash away the pain she's felt
She wants to feel the healing hands
Of someone who understands

And she says take me away
Then take me farther
Surround me now
And hold, hold, hold me
And she says take me away
Then take me farther
Surround me now

It's strange to hear your voice
I did not expect for you to call
You wonder how I'm doing
How I'm holding up
Since you did me wrong

[Chorus]
Well how am I doing since you did what you done to me?
I can't lie I sometimes cry when I think of how it used to be
I keep my friends with me, I stay busy and I don't get much sleep
Baby, that's how I'm doing since you did what you done to me

[Verse 1]
Well now wait one minute, I
Failed to mention
Those tears I cried, are tears of joy
Cause' it was no fun there
Under your thumb and
Now that we're done I'm
Getting right every night
With every single ever-loving girl in sight, so

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Well when all my friends heard what a
You know what you were they
Took me out on the town
But then I heard our song and
I dance along but
It felt all wrong cause
She was sweet, she let me lead
She never took her ever-loving eyes off me so

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Well I don't know what you were thinking
Running round on me
Now you say you're sorry
Well honey I agree...so

[Verse 3]
How are you doing since you did
What you done to me
Girl don't lie you know you cry
Cause' you know how good it used to be
Yeah, tell me does the thought of
Losing my true love make it hard to sleep, baby
How are you doing since you did
What you done to me

[Outro]

I keep a journal of memories
I'm feeling lonely, I can't breathe
I fall to pieces, I'm falling
Fell to pieces and I'm still falling

With more to go
Will the memories die
I'm waiting
Will I find you
Can I find you

What creates my own madness
And I'm addicted to your punishment
And you're the master

But the reality is I'm getting away with murder

Can goods scattered all the way to the curb
Look on her face saying don't say a word
So, it's me and her and a can of beans sitting there on the front porch swing
Western sky all turning red
Head on my shoulder she sighed and said

[Chorus]
Been gophering, chauffeuring, company chairman
Coffee maker, Copy repairman
Anymore there ain't nothing I swear man that I don't do
Been juggling, struggling, closing big deals
Dancing backwards in high heels
Just when it feels like i can't make it through
She said it sure is nice to just be the woman with you

She said the girl I was with the business degree probably wouldn't recognize me
I was gonna run the bank
I was gonna run the math

Here comes life boy ready or not
Hey I wanted it all and that's what I got

[Verse 2]
After all what's the point
'Cause levitation is possible
If you're a fly, achieved and gone
There's time for this and so much more

It's typical, create a world
A special place of my design
To never cope, or never care
Just use the key, 'cause he's alone

There's this girl I know
So deep in love
Do almost any thing
To make him see she's the one
But he doesn't feel a girl like her
He's so so wrapped up
'Coz the average girl will give him
Anything that he wants
He's so caught up
He won't call her

But you never felt the same as I
Never, never, never
Miss him so much

He don't even realize

Llegar la madrugada tu manera de hacerme

She wanna take me home and lay me up inside her home
She wanna turn me on, breakfast in the morning
She said, ""Daddy let me take ya home
Papi let me take ya home""
And I said, ""Mami you can take me home
If you let the whole crew get on"" (bitch)

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
I got this chick from Cali, profilin', she's wylin'
She's gangsta, she knows that she's got it like that
We was drivin' on Crenshaw and cruisin' for food when
She pulled up beside me sat off in a 'Lac
And I said ""Damn girl you actin' like you don't know never seen me before
Episode of cribs on MTV video, what you think TS stand for?""
She said ""Terrific Sex"", yeah that's who and the diamonds is no facade
Used to be a broke nigga from the BX
Now I'm rich got the world screamin' Terror Squad
Think about it now, everywhere we go
Every other city we tour, they never say no
Seems like every other night I got a different chick beggin' me...

She wanna take me home and lay me up inside her home
She wanna turn me on, breakfast in the morning

[Verse 2: Remy Ma]
I was up in the club right had some Remy in my cup right
And that's when I peeped him, he was lookin' so fresh and so cleaned up
From the fitted down to his sneakers
I really do mean this I ain't never seen this, there
Was some people standin' in between us
I had to go over there so I could meet him I had him
Pimped up in the cut near the speakers
If he got a girl I know she's heated 'cause right now I'm all he needin'
If he, crush me then trust me it's a guarantee that he's not leavin'
Told me he heard of me but don't know me and I liked him for some reason
Invited him to my place, sat on his face and I ain't got a man so it ain't cheatin'
Think about it now, I don't gotta stress
I don't never really gotta press, they always say yes
It seems like every other night I got a different nigga beggin' me...

[Chorus: Dre]
She wanna take me home and lay me up inside her home
She wanna turn me on, breakfast in the morning
She said, ""Daddy let me take ya home
Papi let me take ya home""
And I said, ""Mami you can take me home

[Verse 3: Armageddon]
You's a big girl, eat it up
Now tell ya friend to hold your hair while you eatin' up
A little hot, little drunk, little weeded up
We in the truck and freakin' off while the speakers bump
I'm steady speedin' up swervin' the bumps
I'm tryna fuck, but I ain't tryna fuck the 23's up
So I ease up, drunk and focused
Tryna watch the road but yo the back seats heatin' up
And so I'm keepin' them, wish you could see them
I know you hear them breathin' like you been possessed by a demon
I know you heated, wish you was here but, gotta go now have a good evening
Hang up the phone now, have a good weekend
Shorty just called the boat the front seat
And I think she's about to go down for a season
I know the horn ain't beep for no reason
3 in the morning and actin indecent
She so horny damn this shit seems like every other night
I got a group of chicks beggin' me...

394,394,You're The One,"Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh baby
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh baby, oh yeah
I remember when I met you on Crenshaw
I almost crashed my truck and spilled my Hen' dawg
Yes you, God blessed you, I was trying to get next to you
Your homegirls was hating, but I didn't care
You said you had a man, I was like, ""Where?""
It was something so different about you
I felt so gifted around you
Even though you had a man and all
I took the chance to call, we held hands at the mall
That day was so special to me
Your man left you at Mickey D's
You called me, I scooped you up
I seen fear in your eyes, the tears in your eyes
He can't hug you how I hug you
Better yet love you like this thug do
You're so special, you're the one but you're already taken
Oh, I can't help the way I'm feeling
You're the one, I wish, I could replace him
'Cause I know that baby you're the one
I'm having the time of my life felt the world on wheels
You and your homegirl got some skills
Nobody make me feel like you do
Or better yet real like you, I messed around and killed dude
I seen homegirly just flossin', we made eye contact
Dude always is flossin', me never
You and B L A C K forever
Tattered on my neck in green letters
Late night eating Hagen-daz, watching Uncut
And me sitting there, playing wit your butt
Took off your clothes, I hit it on the couch
Even though mom's in the house
Nothing could replace this feeling
It's like winning 2 million, our bond closer than Sicilians
I know old boy, won't leave you alone
I know you love him, but our love is strong
You're so special, you're the one but you're already taken
Oh, I can't help the way I'm feeling
You're the one, I wish, I could replace him
'Cause I know that baby you're the one
I couldn't leave well enough alone, hell I had to hit ya cell phone
I left you a message, it went like this, ""I love you, muah""
I guess it's my luck, I goes to the Magic
Damn, ain't that his truck?
I guess you wit him, screw him
If it wasn't for you, I'd have to do him
You seen 'em at Jack In The Box
He was mackin' a lot, to some rats in a drop
Now you call The Beat and The Power
Dedicate songs every hour all Hell done
Broke loose he got your pass code
To your cell and my Nextel shirt too
I guess it's time for you to decide
Which one of us you want in your ride?
You're so special, you're the one but you're already taken
Oh, I can't help the way I'm feeling
You're the one, I wish, I could replace him
'Cause I know that baby you're the one
You're so special, you're the one but you're already taken
Oh, I can't help the way I'm feeling
You're the one, I wish, I could replace him

Ghetto, ghetto
Ghetto, ghetto livin'

[Verse 1]
These streets remind me of quicksand
When you're on it, you'll keep goin' down
And there's no one to hold on to
And there's no one to pull you out
You keep on fallin', no one can hear you callin'
So you end up self-destructin'
On the corner with the toolie on the waist line
Just got up out the thing doin' state time
Teeth marks on my back from the K-9
Dark memories of when there was no sunshine
‘Cause they said that I wouldn't make it
I remember like yesterday
Holdin' on to what God gave me

Oh, sleepin' in the (ghetto)
Ghetto, that's the life
When you're livin' in the (ghetto)
And eatin' in the (ghetto)
Oh, sleepin' in the (ghetto, ghetto)

[Verse 2]
No need to cherish luxuries
‘Cause everything come and go
Even the life that you have is borrowed
‘Cause you're not promised tomorrow
So live your life as if every day is gon' be your last
Once you've moved forward
You can't go back just to remove your past
‘Cause you gotta be willin' to pray
Yes, there gotta be, there gotta be a better way
Yes, you gotta be willin' to pray
‘Cause there gotta be, there gotta be a better day
Whoever said that the struggle would stop today?
A lot a niggas dead or locked away
Teenage women growin' up with AIDS

Hahahaha, man, you crazy

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
See, it ain't easy bein' me
Life as a celebrity is less than heavenly
I got these fakes and these backstabbers chasing me around
And it's always drama, whenever I wanna get around
Momma told me, long before I ever came up
Gotta be true to what you do and keep the game up
‘Cause things change, and jealousy becomes a factor
Best friends at your wife's house, tryin' to mack her
I'm on tour, but still they keep on knockin' at my door
And I got no time to worry, I'm steady wanting more
Every day is a test, yes, I try hard
But I'm strugglin' with every breath, I pray to God
That the woman that I left at home, all alone
There ain't nothing like tryin' to bone, over the phone
In my mind I can see her naked, I can't take it
Got me shaking at the thought that we can make it
I thought you knew

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I'm rollin' out on tour today
You getting sad, ‘cause I'm going away
The chickenheads wanna play with me
You getting mad, ‘cause you think I'ma sway
Some of 'em cute, some of 'em fine as fuck
I hear 'em scream soon as I hit the stage, nah...
Still I be getting lonely for you
I'm coming home soon as I make this pay, make this pay

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
I call you up long distance, on the telephone
Wanna tuck you in even though I can't make it home
I whisper things in your ear like you're near me
Wonder if you feel me from far away, and can you hear me?
It seems to me, that you're jealous
‘Cause I'm hustling and making money with the fellas
In the backstreets, tryin' to track me, baby, hold up!
Thugs get lonely too, but I'm a soldier
And there's no way I'ma stop making money
‘Cause your attitude's changed and you're acting a little funny
Always complaining, saying we don't spend time
Can't you see I got enough stress on my mind?
And hanging up like you all that
Then get mad when I tell you that I'm busy, baby, call back
Please, ain't nothing left to say to you
Thugs get lonely too, you know

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I'm rollin' out on tour today
You getting sad, ‘cause I'm going away
The chickenheads wanna play with me
You getting mad, ‘cause you think I'ma sway
Some of 'em cute, some of 'em fine as fuck
I hear 'em scream soon as I hit the stage, nah...
Still I be getting lonely for you
I'm coming home soon as I make this pay, make this pay

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
I sit alone in my room, drinking without a care
Talking out loud to you, like you're there
Take your picture out my back pocket, man, it's on
You're the first face I wanna see when I get home
Wanna love you 'til the sun rise, buckwild
Touching every wall in the house, thug style
Put your hands on the headboard, think of me
Drippin' sweat on top of you, sink and see
This in your head that I'm making love, so turn the lights down
Reminisce and relax ‘cause, baby, right now
I feel it in the middle of my stomach
You whisper in my ear and baby, tell me how you really want it
Hold on tightly, watch the ceiling
Scratch my back's how you react, let me know you feel me
‘Cause everything I'm giving to you, is so true
And thugs get lonely too, you know

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I'm rollin' out on tour today
You getting sad, ‘cause I'm going away
The chickenheads wanna play with me
You getting mad, ‘cause you think I'ma sway
Some of 'em cute, some of 'em fine as fuck
I hear 'em scream soon as I hit the stage, nah...
Still I be getting lonely for you
I'm coming home soon as I make this pay, make this pay

[Outro: 2Pac]
Yeah, thug life, baby! Steady thuggin'
Aye, so you remember that
Next time you sweating me when I'm on the road, baby
Thugs get lonely too
We ain't gotta go through all this bullshitting ass problems
If you wanna be real with me, be real with me
If you wanna be fake, move on to the next one, that ain't me","['hahahaha', 'man', 'you', 'crazy', 'see', 'it', 'aint', 'easy', 'bein', 'me', 'life', 'as', 'a', 'celebrity', 'be', 'less', 'than',

Woke up this morning found a letter that she wrote
She said she's tired that I'm always on the road
Too hard to swallow being alone
She needs someone at night that she can hold
She must have told me a thousand times before
Silent cries I use to ignore
God knows I love her
Didn't mean to hurt her

[Chorus]
Baby I'll be
Sitting here waiting on you to come home again
I won't leave
Promise I'll be here to the very end
By your side
To protect you and to love you and to be with you for life
Come on home to me Charlene

[Verse 2]
She knows I really love this old music thing
Since I was a child it's been my dream
I can support her treat her and spoil her
You know buy her the finer things
But I forgot about loving her
Damn the money, diamonds, and pearls
What about the hard day she had with the baby
All she need is for me to love her

[Chorus]
Baby I'll be
Sitting here waiting on you to come home again
I won't leave
Promise I'll be here to the very end
By your side
To protect you and to love you and to be with you for life
Come on home to me Charlene

[Bridge]
Promise I can't live without her
God knows I need her loving
And it hurts so bad that's she gone away
I pray that she'll come back one day
In my life

[Chorus]
Baby I'll be
Sitting here waiting on you to come home again
I won't leave
Promise I'll be here to the very end
By your side
To protect you and to love you and to be with you for life
Come on home to me Charlene

Sick and tired of this world
There's no more air
Tripping over myself

Waiting, suffocating, no direction

And I won't forget the way you loved me
And on the way down

Have you always been inside waiting to breathe
It's alright, sunlight on my face

Cause I have never felt one so right
Each look into your eyes, I'm falling

Looks like we started us a fire
Wrapped up in flames of desire
With every touch, they're burning higher
Two shadows dancing on the wall

With nothing on but the radio
Feel the music playing soft and slow
You and me and the lights down low
With nothing on but the radio

We'll fall asleep here in the moonlight
In tangled sheets, we'll be here all night
And when we wake up in the morning
We might stay like this all day

Two lovers dreaming of forever
And it just keeps on getting better
With every tender little kiss

Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Lost my job, came home mad
Got a hug and a kiss and ""that's too bad""
She said, ""I can go to work until you find another job""
I thought, I like the sound of that
Watch TV and take long naps
Go from a hard working dad to being Mr. Mom

[Chorus]
Well
Pampers melt in a Maytag dryer
Crayons go up one drawer higher
Rewind Barney for the fifteenth time
Breakfast six, naps at nine
There's bubble gum in the baby's hair
Sweet potatoes in my lazy chair
Been crazy all day long
And it's only Monday Mr. Mom

[Verse 2]
Football, soccer, and ballet
Squeeze in Scouts and PTA
And there's that shopping list she left that's seven pages long
How much smoke can one stove make?
The kids won't eat my charcoal cake
It's more than any man can take
Being Mr. Mom

[Chorus]
Well
Pampers melt in a Maytag dryer
Crayons go up one drawer higher
Rewind Barney for the sixteenth time
Breakfast six, naps at nine
There's bubble gum in the baby's hair
Sweet potatoes in my lazy chair
Been crazy all day long
And it's only Monday Mr. Mom

Before I fall in bed tonight
If the dog didn't eat the classifieds
I'm gonna look just one more time

Woo, woo, woo
Breathe

[Refrain]
One and then the two
Two and then the three
Three and then the four
Then you gotta breathe
One and then the two
Two and then the three
Three and then the four
Then you gotta breathe
Then you gotta *gasp*
Then you gotta *gasp*

[Chorus]
Yo, these niggas can't breathe when I come through
Hum too, some shoes, gotta be twenty, man
It's not even funny, they can't (breathe)
The chokehold's too tight
The left looks too right
You know what, you right
These bitches can't (breathe)
Look look, they hearts racing, they start chasing
But I'm so fast when I blow past that they can't (breathe)
In the presence of the man
Your future look better than your past if you present with the man
You better (breathe)

[Verse 1]
You niggas can't share my air
Or walk a mile in the pair I wear
And I'm getting better year by year, like they say wine do
Cops couldn't smell me if you brought the K-9's through
And I pace myself
I know these money-hungry bitches wanna taste my wealth
But I keep em on a diet
Embrace they health, or either keep em on the quiet
And space myself and just take a deep breath
I got em grabbing they chest
Cause it's hurting them to see Fab in his best
And they in they worst
They'd rather see me lay in a hearse than lay in the 'Bach
And I ain't just laying a verse, I'm saying the facts
I came back with some sicker stones
That got these broke niggas looking at me
Like they choking on a chicken bone
Every chick I bone can't leave the dick alone
So I know it's one of them every time I flip my phone
Breathe!

[Verse 2]
I see them on the block when I passes
Looking like they need oxygen mask-es
I make it hard to (breathe)
But I keep the Glocks in the stashes
Cause the cops wanna lock and harass us
And make it hard to (breathe)
They has to react, like having an asthma attack
When they see the plasma in back
You dudes are wheezing behind me
My flow is like a coupe, breezing at ninety
That's the reason they signed me
The slick metaphors and hard punches on the cuts
Feels something like hard punches to the gut
How I address the haters and underestimaters
And ride up on em like they escalators
They shook up and hooked up to respirators
On they last breath talking to investigators
I'm a breath of fresh air in a fresh pair
Face it boo and do it till your face get blue
And then (breathe)

[Refrain]
One and then the two
Two and then the three
Three and then the four
Then you gotta breathe

Then you gotta *gasp*

[Verse 3]
Yo these niggas can't...
When the crew walk in it, pop a few corks in it
As quick as a tick in a New York minute
Catch a breath, 'fore you catch a left
Even worse, catch a Tef', only way you catch an F
To the A-B, it's in the May-B, rolling with my baby
Gripping on a toy that you won't find at KB
I rhyme slick on ya
They gon' have to put the Heimlich on ya
What you know bout letting dimes lick on ya
While you inhale the weed
And it won't stop till they inhale your seed
And it don't stop till I tell 'em to breathe
Like a doctor with a stethoscope
I don't see no fucking hope
Unless these motherfuckers breathe

I love you
I love you
I love you

[Verse 1]
Baby, I love you
You are my life
My happiest moments weren't complete if you weren't by my side
You're my relation, in connection to the sun
With you next to me, there's no darkness I can't overcome
You are my raindrops, I am the seed
With you and God who's my sunlight, I bloom and grow so beautifully
Baby, I'm so proud, proud to be your girl
You make the confusion go all away from this cold and messed up world

[Chorus]
I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave just, just keep loving me
The way I love you, loving me
'Cause I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave just, just keep loving me
The way I love you, loving me

[Verse 2]
And I know you love me
Love me for who I am
'Cause years before, I became who I am
Baby, you were my man
I know it ain't easy, easy loving me
I appreciate the love and dedication from you to me
Later on in my destiny, I see myself having your child
I see myself being your wife, and I see my whole future in your eyes
The thought of all my love for you, sometimes makes me wanna cry
I realize all my blessings, I'm grateful to have you by my side

[Chorus]
I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave just, just keep loving me
The way I love you, loving me
'Cause I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave just, just keep loving me
The way I love you, loving me

[Bridge]
Every time I see your face
My heart smiles
Every time it feels so good, it hurts sometimes
Created in this world to love, to hold, to feel, to breathe, to live you
Dangerously in love

[Chorus]
I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you
I'll never leave just, just keep loving me
The way I love you, loving me
'Cause I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you

Feel this shit right here, Scott Storch, nigga
Yeah Khaled, I see you nigga, show Big Pun love
Uh, yeah, uh, yo

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
I don't give a fuck about your faults or mishappens
Nigga, we from the Bronx, New York; shit happens
Kids clappin', love to spark the place
Half the niggas in the Squad got a scar on their face
It's a cold world and this is ice
Half a mil' for the charm, nigga, this is life
Got the Phantom in front of the building, Trinity Ave
Ten years been legit, they still figure me bad
As a youngin, was too much to cope with
Why you think, muh'fuckers nicknamed me Cook Coke shit?
Should've been called Armed Robbery
Extortion, or maybe Grand Larceny
I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle
Just as long, I knew me and my peoples was gon' bubble
Came out the gate on some Flo-Jo shit
Fat nigga with the shotty was the logo, kid

[Hook: Fat Joe]
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)

[Verse 2: Remy Martin]
R to the Ezzy, M to the Yzzy
My arms stay breezy, the Don stay flizzy
Got a date at 8, I'm in the 7-4-fizzive
And I just bought a bike so I can ride 'til I die
With a matchin' jacket, 'bout to cop me a mansion
My niggas in the club, but you know they not dancin'
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance, we boogie
So never mind how we got in here with burners and hoodies
Listen, we don't pay admission and the bouncers don't check us
And we walk around the metal detectors
And there really ain't a need for a V.I.P section
In the middle of the dance floor reckless, check it
Said he, liked my necklace, started relaxin'
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
See, money ain't a thang, nigga, we still the same niggas
Flows just changed, now we 'bout to change the game, nigga

[Hook: Fat Joe]
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
Now we living better now, Coogi sweater now
And that G4 can fly through any weather now
See, niggas get tight when you worth some millions
This is why I sport the chinchilla: to hurt they feelings
You can find Joe Crack at all type of shit
Out in Vegas front row to all the fights and shit
If 5-0 boy come then they'd proudly squeal
Cause half these rappers they blow like Derek Foreal
If you cross the line, damn right I'm gon' hurt you
These faggot niggas even made gang signs commercial
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin' it up
B2K Crip walkin' like, ""That's what's up!""
Kay keep tellin' me to speak about the Rucker
Matter of fact, I don't wanna speak about the Rucker
Not even Pee Wee Kirkland could imagine this
My niggas didn't have to play to win the championship

[Hook: Fat Joe]
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (come on!)
I said my niggas don't dance

Debbie just hit the wall, she never had it all
One Prozac a day, husband's a CPA
Her dreams went out the door when she turned 24
Only been with one man, what happened to her plan?
She was gonna be an actress, she was gonna be a star
She was gonna shake her ass on the hood of Whitesnake’s car
Her yellow SUV is now the enemy
Looks at her average life, and nothing has been alright

[Chorus]
Since Bruce Springsteen, Madonna
Way before Nirvana
There was U2 and Blondie
And music still on MTV
Her two kids in high school
They tell her that she’s uncool
Cause she's still preoccupied
With 19, 19, 1985

[Verse 2]
She’s seen all the classics, she knows every line
Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, even Saint Elmo’s Fire
She rocked out to Wham, not a big Limp Bizkit fan
Thought she’d get a hand on a member of Duran Duran
Where’s the mini-skirt made of snake skin?
And who’s the other guy that's singing in Van Halen?
When did reality become TV?
Whatever happened to sitcoms, game shows?

[Chorus]
On the radio was Springsteen, Madonna
Way before Nirvana
There was U2 and Blondie
And music still on MTV

They tell her that she’s uncool
Cause she's still preoccupied

She hates time, make it stop
When did Mötley Crüe become classic rock?
And when did Ozzy become an actor?
Please make this stop, stop, stop
And bring back

And I hope you're wishin' on that same

And it's so hard livin' here on my own

Even though we're far apart
And I'll wear our lucky penny 'round my neck
Pressed to my heart

It's beautiful missing something that much
But sometimes love needs a fighting chance
So I'll wait my turn until it's our turn to dance

I wonder, I pray

I sleep alone
I cry alone
Without you this house is not a home

I try alone
I'll wait for you, don't want to die alone

(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
So much for my happy ending
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
So much for my happy ending
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh)

[Verse 1]
Let's talk this over
It's not like we're dead
Was it something I did?
Was it something you said?
Don't leave me hanging
In a city so dead
Held up so high
On such a breakable thread (breakable thread)

[Pre-Chorus]
You were all the things I thought I knew
And I thought we could be

[Chorus 1]
You were everything, everything that I wanted (that I wanted)
We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it (we lost it)
All of the memories so close to me, just fade away
All this time you were pretending
So much for my happy ending

[Hook]
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
So much for my happy ending
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
You've got your dumb friends
I know what they say (know what they say)
They tell you I'm difficult
But so are they (but so are they)
But they don't know me
Do they even know you? (even know you?)
All the things you hide from me
All the shit that you do (all the shit that you do)

[Pre-Chorus]
You were all the things I thought I knew
And I thought we could be

[Chorus 1]
You were everything, everything that I wanted (that I wanted)
We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it (we lost it)
And all of the memories so close to me, just fade away
All this time you were pretending
So much for my happy ending

[Bridge]
It's nice to know that you were there
Thanks for acting like you cared
And making me feel like I was the only one
It's nice to know we had it all
Thanks for watching as I fall
And letting me know we were done

[Chorus 2]
He was everything, everything that I wanted
We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it
And all of the memories so close to me, just fade away
All this time you were pretending
So much for my happy ending

[Chorus 1]
You were everything, everything that I wanted (that I wanted)
We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it (we lost it)
And all of the memories so close to me, just fade away

Breaking my back just to know your name
Seventeen tracks and I've had it with this game
I'm breaking my back just to know your name
But Heaven ain't close in a place like this
Anything goes but don't blink, you might miss
'Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this
I said, oh, heaven ain't close in a place like this
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight

Well, somebody told me you had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential

Ready? Let's roll onto something new
Taking its toll then I'm leaving without you

Had the whole world danglin' at your fingertips

We ran off on graduation night
Thought a couple of left-hand rings would make everything alright

Little bita watchin' a few more candles burn and
Finding out what life was
Oo with a little bita fuss, little bita fight

One day waking up
Oh in a real love

Well I was 22 working double overtime
I was spending dollars and making dimes
We were overdrawn, yea and barely hanging on
Then one night you came to me
With tears in your eyes and an EPT and said
""Guess what? Yea baby ready or not""

I just smiled but I was scared to death
How am I gonna have a kid when I'm still a kid myself?

Can you call a rose by any other name?

Gerald
Just this morning I took a stroll through your garden
I watched the sunrise and it made me think of you
The way you talk to the flowers and make them grow
And in the middle of all these flowers
There's one single stem red rose
It stood out from the rest the fairest of them all
It made me think of what you asked me
Can you call a rose by any other name?

Lady your body moves like poetry
Like a diamond in the raw
You shine for me
No one else can hold her hand up to you girl
Cause you're everything I need in my world lady

Lately all the flowers seem to be so plain
Can you call a rose by any other name
Here inside your garden it's like I feel unchanged
Can you call a rose by any other name?

Gerald
Take your time

Teena
In there, I got a song for you boy
Telling the world about the joy inside my garden

In the shade baby
Cause my world was spinning round
Until you made my love come down never gonna let you go
No, I never gonna let you go

Lately all the flowers seem to be so plain
Can you call a rose by any other name
Here inside your garden it's like I feel unchanged
Can you call a rose by any other name?

Anything you want

Anything you want
Anything you want

Can you call a rose by any other name?

Say
There's one thing [3x]

I'm rich bitch, I'm a fuckin' Big Tymer

[Verse 3]
Move ho, I ain't playin'
Land in the projects in a big jet plane
Roll out in a old ass Chevy van
With your baby mamma cookin' rookie cause I can
I do it on the real, your bitch jockin' stunna grill
I do it on the real, your bitch jockin' stunna grill
'Bout to clown put it down y'all, swing my nuts
Show all y'all niggas how to do donuts
Round and round and round (Skrrt! Stop!)
(This the part where I give my phone number to all the girls that's hot)
Dial 976 that outside dick, or 874 deep down in yo' throat
Have you ever seen a big stretch truck like that?
Now have you ever seen a big bitch butt like that?
Budonkadonk all out of her pants
With a bowlegged cowboy stance (Yee-haw)

[Chorus]
House real big, cars real big
Dick real big, everything real big
Rims real big, pockets real big
Rings real big, let me tell you how I live
Like that, buy that, 24's ride that

Looking back at me, I see that I never really got it right
I never stopped to think of you
I'm always wrapped up in things I cannot win
You are the antidote that gets me by
Somethin' strong, like a drug, that gets me high

[Hook]

Is I'm sorry for the way I am
I never meant to be so cold
Never meant to be so cold

Is I'm sorry for the way I am
I never meant to be so cold

Cold to you, I'm sorry 'bout all the lies
Maybe in a different light
You can see me stand on my own again
'Cause now I can see
You are the antidote that got me by

The screwed up side of me that I keep
Locked inside of me so deep
It always seems to get to me
I never really wanted you to go
So many things you should have known
I guess for me there's just no hope
I never meant to be so cold

418,418,American Idiot,"[Verse 1]
Don't wanna be an American idiot
Don't want a nation under the new mania
And can you hear the sound of hysteria?
The subliminal mind-fuck America

[Chorus]
Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alien nation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

[Verse 2]
Well, maybe I'm the faggot, America
I'm not a part of a redneck agenda
Now everybody do the propaganda
And sing along to the age of paranoia

[Chorus]
Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alien nation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Don't wanna be an American idiot
One nation controlled by the media
Information age of hysteria
It's calling out to idiot America

[Chorus]
Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alien nation
Where everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue","['dont', 'wanna', 'be', 'an', 'american', 'idiot', 'dont', 'want', 'a', 'nation', 'under', 'the', 'new', 'mania', 'and', 'can', 'you', 'hear', 'the', 'sound', 'of', 'hysteria', 'the', 'subliminal', 'mindfuck', 'america', 'welcome', 'to', 'a', 'new', 'kind', 'of', 'tension', 'all', 'across', 'the', 'alien', 'nation', 'where', 'everything', 'isnt', 'mean', 'to', 'be', 'okay', 'television', 'dream', 'of', 'tomorrow', 'be', 'not', 'the', 'ones', 'whore', 'mean', 'to', 'follow', 'for', 'thats', 'enough', 'to', 'argue', 'well', 'maybe', 'im', 'the', 'faggot', 'america', 'im', 'not', 'a', 'part', 'of', 'a', 'redneck', 'agenda', 'now', 'everybody', 'do', 'the', 'propaganda', 'and', 'sing', 'along', 'to', 'the', 'age', 'of', 'paranoia', 'welcome', 'to', 'a', 'new', 'kind', 'of', 'tension', 'all', 'across', 'the', 'alien', 'nation', 'where', 'everything', 'isnt', 'mean', 'to', 'be', 'okay', 'television', 'dream', 'of', 'tomorrow', 'be', 'not', 'the', 'ones', 'whore', 'mean', 'to', 'follow', 'for', 'thats', 'enough', 'to', 'argue', 'dont', 'wanna', 'be', 'an', 'american', 'idiot', 'one', 'nation', 'control', 'by', 'the', 'media', 'information', 'age', 'of', 'hysteria', 'its', 'call', 'out', 'to', 'idiot', 'america', 'welcome', 'to', 'a', 'new', 'kind', 'of', 'tension', 'all', 'across', 'the', 'alien', 'nation', 'where', 'everything', 'isnt', 'mean', 'to', 'be', 'okay', 'television', 'dream', 'of', 'tomorrow', 'be', 'not', 'the', 'ones', 'whore', 'mean', 'to', 'follow', 'for', 'thats', 'enough', 'to', 'argue']",183,Green Day,Green Day,2005,[90],1,American Idiot,https://open.spotify.com/track/6nTiIhLmQ3FWhvrGafw2zj,6nTiIhLmQ3FWhvrGafw2zj,spotify:track:6nTiIhLmQ3FWhvrGafw2zj,American Idiot,5dN7F9DV0Qg1XRdIgW8rke,spotify:album:5dN7F9DV0Qg1XRdIgW8rke,Green Day,7oPftvlwr6VrsViSDV7fJY,spotify:artist:7oPftvlwr6VrsViSDV7fJY,176.34599999999998,9.0,77.0,2004-09-21,0.38,0.988,1.0,-2.042,1.0,0.0639,2.64e-05,7.859999999999999e-05,0.368,0.769,186.113,"['modern rock', 'permanent wave', 'punk']",[],1.0

Got the sun in the morning
I got the moon at night
I got your arms around me, everything's alright
Holding you tight is how I'd like to spend the
The rest of my life
Feel the warm breeze blowing
Down through the trees
I've got your love beside me, child, that's all I need
My heart and soul is wide open to you
Nobody but you, sweet baby
No one but you, yeah

Of happiness and joy you bring

Just want to hold you
How I adore you
You've got that special touch that I long for oh so much
Oh, I'm amazed at how you right all that's wrong in my world
All I am and I hope to be
Is 'cause of you and what you do
You bring out the best in me
My heart and soul is wide open, darling
Nobody but you, sweet baby
