[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Yellow diamonds in the light

But I've gotta let it go

Shine a light through an open door
Love and life, I will divide
Turn away cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

2,It Will Rain,"[Verse 1]
If you ever leave me, baby
Leave some morphine at my door
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
To realize what we used to have
We don't have it anymore
There's no religion that could save me
No matter how long my knees are on the floor, oh
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm making
To keep you by my side
To keep you from walking out the door

[Chorus]
'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same if you walk away
Everyday, it will rain
Rain, rain

[Verse 2]
I'll never be your mother's favorite
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye
Ooh, if I was in their shoes, I'd be doing the same thing
Saying there goes my little girl
Walking with that troublesome guy
But they're just afraid of something they can't understand
Ooh, but little darling watch me change their minds
Yeah, for you I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try
I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding
If that'll make you mine

[Chorus]
'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same if you walk away
Everyday, it will rain
Rain, rain

[Bridge]
Ooh, don't you say (Don't you say)
Goodbye (Goodbye)
Don't you say (Don't you say)
Goodbye (Goodbye)
I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding
If that'll make it right

Yes I can, doubt better leave, I'm runnin' with this plan
Pull me, grab me, crabs in the bucket can't have me
I'll be the president one day
January first, oh, you like that gossip?
Like you the one drinking what God sip—dot com
Now I gotta word for your tongue
How many rolling stones you want?

Speaking it and it's done
Woke up on the side of the bed like I won
Talk like a winner, my chest to that sun
G5 dealer, U.S. to Taiwan

A Bugatti boy, plus Maybach

The mountain top, walk on water
I got power, feel so royal
One second I'ma strike all you
Diamond, platinum, no more for you
Got adrenaline, never giving in
Giving up's not an option, gotta get it in
Witness, I got the heart of 20 men
No fear, go to sleep in the lion's den
That flow, that spark, that crown
You looking at the king of the jungle now
Stronger than ever, can't hold me down
A hundred miles gunning from the pitcher's mound
Straight game face, it's game day
See me running through the crowd full of melee
No trick plays, I'm Bill Gates, take a genius to understand me

4,The One That Got Away,"[Verse 1]
Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you

[Chorus]
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Verse 2]
I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

[Chorus]
But in another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Post-Chorus]
The one
The one
The one
The one that got away

[Bridge]
All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me, whoa
'Cause now I pay the price

[Chorus]
In another life, I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away

[Post-Chorus]
The one (The one)

5,Ni**as in Paris,"[Verse:Edisto]
SKR let me define it
South Kak Rebel still remain defient
Underrated but ill still fluxuate the climate
Talkin north pole cole zip up ya hyvent
Can you even register half the stuff that I vent
Just then to ascend like advent raising
Bringing evil to your residents like da tyrant
Flip my lid pressurized flow like a hydrant so that makes me suited for the hose
Live line on ladder 49, she's sliding down the pole
And that should be the Headline, cuz thats something they know
Keep the opposition's vision obsolete therefore thats OVO
Triangulate my position from using spokeo
Southern rapper but my influence was sent from Tokyo
Hajmemashite to my foes with no intro just ikuzo

6,Someone Like You,"[Verse 1]
I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
""Don't forget me,"" I beg
I'll remember, you said
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead.""
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead.""

[Verse 2]
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
""Don't forget me,"" I beg
I'll remember, you said
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead.""

[Bridge]
Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

[Breakdown]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
""Don't forget me,"" I beg
I'll remember, you said
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead.""

7,Without You,"[Verse 1]
You said that we would always be
Without you I feel lost at sea
Through the darkness you'd hide with me
Like the wind we'd be wild and free

[Pre-Chorus]
You said you'd follow me anywhere
But your eyes tell me you won't be there

[Chorus]
I've gotta learn how to love without you
I've gotta carry my cross without you
Stuck in the middle and I'm just about to
Figure it out without you
And I'm done sitting home without you
Fuck, I'm going out without you
I'm gonna to tear this city down without you
I'm goin' Bonnie and Clyde without you

Now I'm running away, my dear
From myself and the truth I fear

How I'm wishing that you were here

If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I ask you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like yikky-yeah check it, Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk?
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops? (Turn it up)
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop (Peace)
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know, we come and go like on the interstate (Never know)

[Pre-Chorus 2: Travie McCoy]
I think I finally found a note to make you understand
If you could hit it, sing along and take me by the hand
Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune

Wobbledy wobbledy, wo-wobble wobble

How your waist anorexic and then your ass is colossal? Like woo
Drop that ass, make it boomerang
Take my belt off, bitch I'm Pootie Tang
Tippy tow, tippy tay, you gon' get a tip today
Fuck that, you gon' get some dick today
I walk in with my crew, and I'm breaking they necks
I'm looking all good, I'm making her wet
They pay me respect, they pay me in checks
And if she look good, she pay me in sex
Bounce that ass, it's the roundest
You're the best, you deserve a crown bitch
Right on that ass

[Verse 2]
Okay stop, drop it, drop it
You got everybody in here, oh my goshing
Bad bitches I'm your dada, white girls go Gaga
When the sticks out they bust it open like ya ya's a Pinata
Bitch look down, tell me what's up
Girl you talk too much, shut up
I got that mad dick, you know it always nut up
And it got an attitude, no wonder why it's stuck up
Pop it then backflip, yo gymnastics got me ecstatic
Your whole crew look like a pageant
I'm dropping cash tips and some taxes
Girl you got me about to pass out
I'm wondering if cupid gave you ass shots
'Cause I'm in love with that ass

12,Set Fire To The Rain,"[Produced by Fraser T Smith]

[Verse 1]
I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

[Pre-Chorus]
But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

[Verse 2]
When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing is better

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time

[Bridge]
Sometimes, I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you

[Chorus]
I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time

13,Work Out,"[Intro]
I want to see you work out for me, work out for me

[Chorus]
Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then

[Bridge]
Let me see you get high, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)
High, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)

[Verse 1]
She like them boys with the big ol' chains
Ridin' around town in a big ol' Range
I knew her when I rocked big ol' jeans
Now the little nigga doin' big ol' thangs
Would you look at that? I came back for her
Just to give it to ya, like you asked for it
Man, that thing in them jeans too fat for her
Rebounds so I caught her off the backboard
I told her: “Baby girl, come here
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there.”
And I brag hardly, but just to show up at this party
I made what yo' nigga make in one year
That's unfair, but so is life, take a chance, roll the dice
Money can’t buy you love, 'cause it’s overpriced
Don’t overthink, just hope it's right
I’m only here for the night

[Chorus]
Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then

[Bridge]
Let me see you get high, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)
High, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)

[Verse 2]
Carolina Blue kicks, fresh on the scene
Hottest nigga on the block
Damn, girl, you're mean
They be startin' shit, but it’s yo' world
On my Martin shit: “You go, girl!”
She bad and she know it
Some niggas save hoes, I’m not that heroic
Could you be my escort?
'Cause just like them two door Fords
Damn, they don’t make 'em like you no more
Cole World, real Cole World
Them boys cool—me, I’m on fire
Know what's on my mind
Tryna see what's on yours tonight, tonight, tonight
Move slow, 'cause you wanna live fast
Up late so you'll probably skip class
Life is a test so before the night pass, get right, get right

[Chorus]
Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then (Cole World)

Do you really wanna love me forever? (Oh oh oh)

[Verse 1]
I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin' the consequence
Drinkin' every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floatin' in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt ‘cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it (Ayy), please don't do it (Ayy)
‘Cause one of us goes in, and we all go through it (Ayy)
And Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gonna pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know

They know, they know, they know (They know, ayy)
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know

[Verse 2]
Yeah!
I be yellin' out, ""Money over everything! Money on my mind!""
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says, ""They miss the old Drake"", girl don't tempt me
""If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do""
I'm like, ""Why I gotta be all that?""
But still I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listening to you expressin' all them feelings
Soap opera rappers, all these niggas sound like All My Children
And that's who you thinkin' is 'bout to come and make a killin'
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
‘Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it
I ain't even gotta say it, they know

[Chorus]
They know, they know, they know (They know)
They know, they know, they know

I heard once that they would rather hear about memories than enemies
Rather hear what was or will be than what is
Rather hear how you got it over, how much it cost you
Rather hear about findin' yourself than how you lost you
Rather you make this an open letter
About family and struggle and it takin' forever
About hearts that you’ve broken and ties that you’ve severed

For barbecues, tailgates, fairs, and festivals
And you, sir, do not have a pair of testicles

And in 14 years, they are decomposable
And unlike my home, they are not foreclosable

But I really hate how you're easy to crack

Admiring at how sharply my first name is written
On you with a Sharpie when I get to hitting
On them to help me get lucky

Mr. Know-It-All
Well ya, you think you know it all
But ya don't know a thing at all
Ain't it, ain't it something, y'all?
When somebody tells you something 'bout you
Think that they know you more than you do
So you take it down, another pill to swallow

[Verse 2]
Mr. Bring-Me-Down
Well ya, ya like to bring me down, don't ya?
But I ain't laying down, baby, I ain't goin' down
Can't nobody tell me how it's gonna be
Nobody gonna make a fool outta me, baby
You should know that I lead, not follow

[Chorus]
Oh, you think that you know me, know me
That's why I'm leaving you lonely, lonely
'Cause baby, you don't know a thing about me
You don't know a thing about me
You ain't got the right to tell me
When and where to go, no right to tell me
Acting like you own me lately
Yeah, baby, you don't know a thing about me
You don't know a thing about me

[Verse 3]
Mr. Play-Your-Games
Only got yourself to blame
When you want me back again
But I ain't falling back again
'Cause I'm living my truth without your lies
Let's be clear, baby, this is goodbye
I ain't coming back tomorrow

[Chorus]
Oh, you think that you know me, know me
That's why I'm leaving you lonely, lonely
'Cause baby, you don't know a thing about me
You don't know a thing about me

Yeah, baby, you don't know a thing about me
You don't know a thing about me

So what? You've got the world at your feet
And you know everything about everything
But you don't
You still think I'm coming back, but baby, you'll see

[Chorus]
Oh, you think that you know me, know me (Yeah, yeah)
That's why I'm leaving you lonely, lonely

21,Not Over You,"[Verse 1]
Dreams: that's where I have to go
To see your beautiful face anymore
I stare at a picture of you and listen to the radio
Hope, hope there's a conversation
We both admit we had it good
But until then it's alienation, I know
That much is understood
And I realize

[Chorus]
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say I'm  not over you
(not over you)

[Verse 2]
Damn, damn girl you do it well
And I thought you were innocent
Took this heart and put it through hell
But still you're magnificent
I I'm a boomerang, doesn't matter how you throw me
I turn around and I'm back in the game
Even better than the old me
But I'm not even close without you

[Chorus]
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say I'm not over you

[Bridge]
And if I had the chance to renew
You know there isn't a thing I wouldn't do
I could get back on the right track
But only if you'd be convinced
So until then...

If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine

Girl I know I don’t know you
But your pretty little eyes so blue
Are pulling me in
Like the moon on your skin
I’m so glad you trusted me
To slide up on this dusty seat
And let your hair down
Get out of town

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Got the stars coming out over my hood
And all I know now is it's going good

[Chorus]
You got your hands up
You’re rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You’re singing every song
I’m set on cruise control
I’m slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
You’re looking so damn hot

[Post-Chorus]
And I don’t know what road we’re on
Or where we’ve been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I don’t want this night to end

[Verse 2]
Going to cuss the morning when it comes
'Cause I know that the rising sun
Ain’t no good for me
'Cause you’ll have to leave
Going to make the most of every mile
Do anything to make your smile
Land on my lips
Get drunk on your kiss

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Clock on the dash says 3:35
There’s plenty of gas and the night’s still alive

[Chorus]
You got your hands up
You’re rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You’re singing every song
I’m set on cruise control
I’m slowly losing hold

23,Make Me Proud,"[Verse 1: Drake]
I like a woman with a future and a past
A little attitude problem all good, it’ll make the shit last
Don’t make it too easy, girl, don’t take it too fast
Yeah, that's it right there
That's it, do it just like that
Only you can do it just like that
And I love it when your hair still
Wet cause you just took a shower
Running on a treadmill and only eating salad
Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard
Knowing you, weekend in Miami trying to study by the pool
Couple things due but you always get it done
Might've been a time when I loved her too
But you take that away and you’ve always been the one
One, I wonder why the moon looks nice, girl
Maybe it’s just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl
They want you in their life as a wife
That's why you want to have no sex, why you want to protest
Why you want to fight for your right
Cause you don’t love them boys
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise

[Chorus: Drake]
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Can’t you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
It’s just amazing, girl, and all I can say is
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you

Mansions in Malibu, Babylon
But I never mention everything I dabble in
And I always ride slow when I’m straddling
And my shit’s so wet you gotta paddle in
Gotta r-r-row, gotta row ya boat
It’s Pink Friday Records and OVO
Done did the pop tour, I’m the realest still
The best legal team so the deals is ill
It’s MAC, OPI, and a fragrance, too
Apparel, I’m dominating every avenue
Cobblestone, good view, little gravel too
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too
Cause I’m fl-fl-fly I'm flying high
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitch
But baby, if you ask me to take a break
I’ll give it all away, don’t care what the people say
I’ll be a million, billion, trillion miles away aha
He asked my sign, I said a Sag’
I’m a star: sheriff badge
What's the point if I’m guarding?

Kiss the bartender twice, I'm a loser

Won't poke holes in the seat with my heels
Cause that's where we make love

I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale I'm weighin' sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well, just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm danglin' my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me: nose-bleed seats
And today I went shoppin' and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split!

Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, ""Baby, it's real.""

I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here
Baby, you know the deal
And she bad, so maybe she won't, ugh
But shit, then again, maybe she will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, she will, she will, ugh
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now

I tell her, ""Now go and pop that pussy for me!""
Haters can't see me, but them bitches still lookin' for me
And you could take it to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about I, give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her 'til she cry—call that ""wine 'n' dine""
Try to check me and I'ma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say, ""Choose wisely,"" that's why I was chosen
Rockin' like asphalt, it's the cash fault
Looked in the face of Death and took its mask off
Now, I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl face south and her ass north
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split!

Oh, the fearlessness of thoughts in print
Strips the chord of a sensible word
And what's worse?
She left her mark
Indelible
Oh, the nature of her scripted verse
Keeps my eyes
Set on the page
And it says

""Frankly dear, I'm forced to give it up
Tried my hand and now I've had enough
Even though we have to say goodbye
Keep me in mind
Keep me in mind
Keep me in mind""

[Verse 2]
Blamed in advance
For the past
With no bearing on the present tense
All that's left
Are claims that she made
When she said
""Oh dear someday
You'll learn to be
Someone better fit to pursue me
But 'til then
We'll call it the end""
And she adds

Okay, I'm young and I’m tatted, I get them bucks like an addict
Rockin' this Christian Dior, I spend so much on my fabric
I got a wifey at home and what she wants she can have it
And she in love with my stick, she say I work it like magic
Okay, now no need to panic, I'm on a beach where the sand is
Somewhere smokin' on medication, no, I won't need a bandage
Some would look at my age and try to say I'm young and I'm handsome
I say I'm filthy fuckin' rich, so I'm an old dirty bastard
And my crib's a disaster and my kush is the master
I was in my yellow car, but my Ferrari go faster
Soundin' like a band in it and my diamonds the dancers
On the remix with Kesha, 'bout to go see the cashier
On the grind, so now my watch has got a lot of diamonds in it
I look down and see a hundred thou' and think it's time to get it
Brought a lot of marijauna and I'm here to share it

God gives him his ultimatum, can't see how momma hates him

I only say this in cadence, so it don't get negated
I was gon' save it for later, but later look like maybe
This crazy lady named Kesha is guessing my Mercedes
Would be all new and frou-frou, but it's the 1980s
But now that we are cool-cool, she sippin' Irish Baileys
She say, ""Stacks, you’re true blue?"" I said, ""nah, I’m Navy""

I'ma rap to you real quick
I wanna enjoy the luxury of like
Not knowing each other for real
Hol' up
Lotus flower bomb firefly
When I'm low, she take me high
I can teach you all the sounds of love

[Verse 1: Wale]
Flowerbomb, let me guess your favorite fragrance
And you got that bomb, huh, I'm tryna detonate you
No disrespecting baby, just tryna make you smile
Try to keep my spirits up, that's why I lays it down
Try to keep your spirits up, lil vodka whatever
Took you forever to get dressed, I acknowledge your effort
So I clap for her, she deserves an applause
Shawty working so hard, she deserve that Vuitton
Shawty where your baton, racing through my mind like
She heard that I got that work, I heard that she been on strike
Care to tell, I read your mind, she been on them dollars first
Caramel macchiatos when shawty get into work
I can be your boyfriend, be your nigga or a friend with perks
I'm just tryna work that huh, they just tryna work your nerves
I'm just tryna read your mind, I'm just tryna feed you mine
I'm just tryna give you light, they just tryna leave you blind

[Hook: Miguel]
We're living in a fantasy
I feel it when you dance with me
It's feeling like you need to be
My lady, my baby, yeah
Can't you see
I'm talking about eternity
Tell me would you care to be
My lady, my baby

[Verse 2: Wale]
Flower bomb, can I blow up on your mind
This is not no Sandra Bull, but you're Potion #9
Navigating through her eyes, destination to her thighs
And I hate to tell you too much, cuz I stay with too much pride
And we way too young to know love, maybe not but we don't need no rush
Don't believe in love at first sight, but I believe in love at first huh
Can I be with you just one night, I could wear you out inside
I could tell you like persistence, but I make you cum in tri's
I just think we need one night, can't decide if I came right
Easy baby my thing tight, but that lotus flower just ain't right
I ain't thinking I ain't right, can't decide but I can't fight
Easy baby, you the bomb and all, but I be damned if I do not land mine
Or at least try, can I speak up? was it peace out? can we eat lunch?
Can we take shots? What's your flavor? Flat drinks we call A cups
I just think I need one night, slightly more if it's done right
With that gorgeous face, I don't know your name, it ain't important babe 'cause I'ma call you Mine

[Hook: Miguel]
We're living in a fantasy
I feel it when you dance with me
It's feeling like you need to be

Sometimes hate can be the best love

Walkin' in like I got cameras on me
Niggas can't control me, ain't no handles on me
Shit don't get out of hand, it get handled, homie
Got a pretty young girl look like Janet on me
She a pretty penny and she know I'm doing numbers
Till we crash up the whole database
I bring it home like I'm base to base to base
Closet lookin' like Planet of the Bathing Apes
What you think this life just landed on me?
My whole city look like it's abandoned, homie
And we came straight out of those abandoned homes
Every wish we ever had got granted, homie
And I'll never take that shit for granted
Even when the marble floor and counter top is all granite
Back before I got paid any advances
Back when my rollie was ticking, no dancing
Nigga, never did I slip or I panic
Even if I was the captain of Titanic
Riding through the north Atlantic, homie
I never jumped crew or abandoned, homie
All the fruits of my labor organic, homie
Making sure my family tree got hammocks on it
And a good guy can change, 'specially if he short-changed
So fuck is my ransom, homie?

Livin' life on the deep end, F-F allegiance
Beat the odds and got even
What you think, that we just started, nigga?
Boy, the sword just got sharper, nigga
This ain't war, we just sparring, nigga
I was on the rooftop with my nigga Mike Carson, nigga

Fuck yo' night list, fuck yo' day list, fuck yo' playlist
I'm from the D, fuck your A-list

And weathered all the sun and rain

There's still a rope burn on that old branch, that hangs over the river
I still got the scar
From swinging out a little too far

It's where we loved, lived and learned real life stuff
It's everything we're made of

Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles

Aren’t who I want to be

But you stay here right beside me
Watch as the storm blows through
And I need you

Cause God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you

There's more here than what we’re seeing
A divine conspiracy
That you, an angel lovely
Could somehow fall for me
You'll always be love's great martyr
And I'll be the flattered fool
And I need you
Yeah!

God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
And for when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true

Half of what I could be
I can't do without you
We are stitched together
And what love has tethered
I pray we never undo

49,We Owned The Night,"[Verse 1]
Tell me, have you ever wanted someone so much it hurts?
Your lips keep trying to speak
But you just can't find the words
Well, I had this dream once
I held it in my head

[Verse 2]
She was the purest beauty
But not the common kind
She had a way about her
That made you feel alive
And for a moment
We made the world stand still

[Chorus]
Yeah, we owned the night

[Verse 3]
You had me dim the lights;
You danced just like a child
The wine spilled on your dress
And all you did was smile
Yeah, it was perfect
I hold it in my mind

[Chorus]
Yeah, we owned the night
Oh yeah

[Bridge]
When the summer rolls around
And the sun starts sinking down
I still remember you
Oh, I remember you
And I wonder where you are
Are you looking at those same stars again?
Do you remember when?

[Verse 4]
We woke under a blanket
All tangled up in skin
Not knowing in that moment
We'd never speak again
But it was perfect
I never will forget
When we owned the night

Yeah, we owned the night
Yeah

But they act like they know me
And they play the part perfect
Cause they confuse me for homie
But I don't play that

Everybody start dissing
But once they see the commission
They start to throw they chips in
But I don't play that
No no homie don't play that
No no I don't need nobody
I don't need nobody who'll tell me that they love me
When I know don't nobody do, yeah

51,You,"[Verse 1]
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I

I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Verse 2]
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead

52,All Your Life,"Put a new shirt on, wash my face in beer
Fall through the crowd and disappear
In the teenage magazines and shopping malls
Walk through the wildlife for miles and miles
Hold my breath and count a hundred and ten
And back up the hill to start again

Watch the spiders on the bedroom ceiling
They got big plans, so they're not breathing
Feel the frission of tomorrow today
I could get up but it won't go away
Do nothing to impress my friends
Just rub my eyes for hours on end
Oh England, my love, you lost me, made me look a fool

I need someone to tell me
Everything will be alright
I need someone who'll hold me
When the day turns to night
I need someone who loves me
More than you do
Oh we say that's not true
And you and me in line as double bill
Surrogate heroes on TV and films

I've never met anyone like you
I've never done the things you like to do
On the way to heaven in a comedy car
The new stars of melancholy, ah
There's nothing to get angry about
We're too hung over to be bash out
Oh England, my love, you've tattooed your past all over me

I need someone to tell me
Everything will be alright
I need someone who'll hold me
When the day turns to night
I need someone who loves me
More than you do
Oh we say that's not true
And you and me in line as double bill
I've got a feeling that nobody's sold
I've got a feeling that you'll let yourself go go go

And days will be like this
All your life

You can't help but turn them heads, knocking 'em dead
Dropping like flies around you
If I get your body close, not letting go
Hoping you're about to

Like a TV show playing reruns
Every chance I get, I'ma turn you on

They say I'm a celebrity, what the fuck's a celebrity?
I guess I must invest in the proper form of protection
And I say it's a curse, but it's been mostly a blessin'
To a nigga from the hood
Tryin' to aim for the top, I didn't even need no directions
I just wake up then I roll up the purp

I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know.. we know
They won't get you like I will, my only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all on the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste, ah
Pushing me away so I give her space, ah
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry, you won't ever have to hide
You've seen all my mistakes so look me in my eyes

'Cause if you let me
Here is what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost

[Verse 2: Drake]
It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you but I'll lie if I have to
Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do, you do
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
You hate being alone well you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream
And they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you some
To save you; instead, they say:

Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true
Don't tell me, I don't care

You don't care, if you're true

Give me a second I, I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom
Getting higher than the Empire State
My lover, she's waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking 'bout a scar
And I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget it
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies
You know, I'm trying hard to take it back
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home

We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun

Now I know that I'm not
All that you got
I guess that I, I just thought
Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
But our friends are back
So let's raise the cup
'Cause I found someone to carry me home

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter
Than the sun

We are young

59,A Thousand Years,"[Verse 1]
Heart beats fast
Colors and promises
How to be brave
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?
But watching you stand alone
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow
One step closer

[Chorus]
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

[Verse 2]
Time stands still
Beauty in all she is
I will be brave
I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath
Every hour has come to this
One step closer

[Chorus]
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

[Bridge]
And all along I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
One step closer
One step closer

I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

60,Tonight Is The Night,"First of all I'd like to say good evening
And we're so pleased that
So many of you could come out and share
In all the love and all the happiness we have in store for you
We want you to have a real good time
'Cause that's just what we have in mind
Is that alright with you
Now, this is a tune that I composed
And it's called
Tonight is the night
That you make me a woman
Now I never intended recording this song
It was a personal poem
This is until the day that my producer
Happened to thumb through the pages of my notebook
He came across the words and he said
'We got to somethin' with these words
It's happening every day
And people wanna hear about it, Betty'
You see, it's the story of a young girl
Making love for the very first time
Now when I finally got a melody
I took it home and I-I played it for my mother
Now I got to tell you a little bit about my mother
You see I come from one of those pretty large families
And I'm the baby of the family
And you know you never grow up to your mother
I'll never forget the way she looked at me when I played it for her
She said, 'Uh, I like the music
You know, baby, the melody it's really nice
But I know you're not gonna sing that song'
But we eased it right on by, yes, we did
And it became one of my biggest records too
So I want you to do this for me if you will
Everybody think back to your very first time
Now I'll give you a little while longer
'Cause I know some of you
Have to think back a little further than others
Come on now, I want you to play catch-up
'Cause I don't want you waitin' till I get to the end of my song
Sayin', 'Oh, yeah, now I remember'
Now whether it was good
Or you just smilin' it was good
Or on the other hand if it was not so good
Here's my story

Hmm...hmm...mmm...mmm...

Tonight is the night
That you make me a woman, mmm...
You said you'll be gentle with me
And I-I hope you will, mmm...mmm...

I'm nervous and I'm tremblin'
Waitin' for you to walk in
I'm tryin' hard to relax
But I just can't keep still, no

I can hear your car door slammin'
I wanna play big girl and put on a sexy smile
But I know so little about what love is
I just can't help actin' like a child

You're knockin' on my door and you're ringin' my bell
Hope you're not impatient after waiting so very long
A whole year I put you off with my silly hang-ups
And we're both old enough to know right from wrong

Tonight is the night
That you make me a woman, mmm...
You said you'll be gentle with me
And I-I hope you will, hmm...mmm...
I'm nervous and I'm tremblin'
Waitin' for you to walk in
Tryin' hard to relax
But I just can't keep still

Mmm...hey, baby
Ho, ho, baby
Ho...yeah...yeah...

Oh, but what if my mama should come home early
And catch us doin' what we're doin'
Not only will I never live it down
But my whole family relationship it'll all be ruined
But we've gone a little bit too far now
Oh, to turn around
So let's just pray
That true love is what we've found

Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight

Ho, I'll never forget tonight
No, no, I'll never forget tonight
That's when you make me feel real, mmm...hmm...
You make me feel real, real good
Oh...oh...whoa...oh...oh...whoa...whoa...
Yeah, and I wanna thank your love
Said I've got to thank your love
'Cause you make me feel good
And I love you, baby
I love you and I know it
And I ain't too proud to show it
'Cause I love you, baby
And I need you, baby
I want you, my love, my love
My, my, my baby
I'll never forget tonight
No, I'll never forget tonight
'Cause you make me feel good
And I love you, baby
You make me feel real good
And I love you, baby
'Cause you gave me
Uh, uh, pure love, yeah
Uh, uh, uh, pure love
Said I like that, baby
Uh, uh, pure love
Said I need that, sugar
Uh-uh-uh, pure love
There's nothin' phony about it
Uh-uh, pure love
Your love I can't do without it
Uh-uh-uh, pure love, ooh

I love him, I know it
I ain't too proud to show it
I love him, I know it
I ain't too proud to show it
I love him, I know it
I ain't too proud to show it
I love him, I know it

61,You And I,"[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
Feel like I have dated every woman in the world
Most were beautiful
Some were corporate
Worked in a little cubicle
I done some shit to some that I would never do to you
Cause some were tailor made but still wasn't suitable
Come to yours I see why you be elusive
Some took advantage off you, some were intrusive
Some put they hands on you, some were abusive
Most cheated on you must they think you were exclusive
Ain't gotta say a word, I already know it
Even if you scared to death it's ill that you never show it
I go to sleep with fear of losing you, don't wanna blow it
And I wouldn't be surprised if I did, that's typical Joe shit
I lie forever
Not only do she trust me, her body is a work of art
There's a beauty in every ugly
So for me as a friend though our past is so horrible
Together we'll never have to see em' again
I love you

[Chorus: Emanny]
You and I, you and I seem crazy
I would die, if you leave my life baby
No one else gave a damn 'bout us
Where we go, I don't know the future
I just know, I don't wanna lose ya
We just taking our chance on love, on love

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
I've been with every woman in this world, except a virgin chick
Some kept my soul alive just so they can murder it
We're both broken pieces, both been hurt and shit
Both took a chance on each other and it was worth the risk
She low maintenance but she deserves a grip
Give her the best of me cause she endured the worst of it
She been through so much, still she carry on
So if she comes with baggage, it's a carry-on
So in life without, I couldn't conceive
I tried to dump her one time, but she wouldn't leave
And I ain't want her to, so that was good to see
Soon as I uttered the word I damn near couldn't breathe
Been trough the run around, took her off the carousel
Still in shock that her passion's unparalleled
I know some exes must be mad as hell
But we were so broken down, we had to gel
I love you

[Chorus: Emanny]
You and I, you and I seem crazy
I would die, if you leave my life baby
No one else gave a damn 'bout us
Where we go, I don't know the future
I just know, I don't wanna lose ya
We just taking our chance on love, on love

[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
I've been with every type of woman, some of the baddest ones
Some were cougars, but still they acted young
Some were gossip queens, but I ain't mad at them
You make bittersweet, today that shit matters none
Some I knew wouldn't last when that crash begun
Some played it cool, but wasn't half as fun
Some ain't over me, they just blame away
Some I ruined myself, others came that way
Some were modelesque, left, started gaining weight
Other waited to gain, but met the same fate
Some moved to the city for a change of pace
Some I never broke up with, just let it fade away
Some never witnessed love, don't know what we see in it
Was a stranger for you, so it's ill how you believe in it
Cause you done dated a few
If I'mma take a chance on love, I thank God he let me take it with you
I love you

[Chorus: Emanny]
You and I, you and I seem crazy
I would die, if you leave my life baby

I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around, can't speak
I can't speak

[Verse 1]
I know what your boy like
Skinny tie and a cuff type
He go and make breakfast
You walk around naked
I might just text you
Turn your phone over, when it's all over
No settling down, my text go to your screen
You know better than that
I come around when you least expect me
I'm sitting at the bar when your glass is empty
You thinking that this song's coming on to tempt me
I need to be alone like the way you left me
You start calling, you start crying
I come over, I'm inside you
I can't find you, the girl that I once had
But the sex that we have isn't half bad
Text say that ""It's not fair""
That's code for ""He's not here""
And I'ma flirt with this new girl
And I'ma call if it don't work
So we fuck 'til we come to conclusions
All the things that we thought we were losing
I'm a ghost and you know this
That's why we broke up in the first place
'Cause

I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go, heartbeat

[Verse 2]
It's late night Thursday
I know that you heard me
But you don't want the same thing
Well two can play that game
So I'm chilling with my girlfriend
But she not my real girlfriend
She got a key to my place but
She's not my real girlfriend
Stupid, so dummy
Say the wrong thing and wrong girls come runnin'
I'm paranoid that these girls want something from me
And it's hard to make a dime go 100
And my dude freakin' out over a worse fate
She on time, but she late for they first date
Cause he went and tried out a new condom
Slipped off in a threesome, good problems?
Right? Wrong
Askin' him if she wanna play games
With the Super Smash Brothers, but none of them you
I miss the sex when you kiss whenever you through
69 is the only dinner for two
I was wrong, but would you have listened to you?
Uh, you were crazy
I got a heart, but the artichoke
Is the only thing girls want when you in that smoke
And light

I wanted you to know

[Verse 3]
So we're done? This the real shit?
We used to hold hands like field trips
I'm a jerk, but your dude is a real dick
I read his post on your wall and I feel sick
He ain't cool, he ball and all that
But he just a fake nigga who blog in all caps
You couldn't wait to date
I'm going straight for your thighs like the cake you ate
I give a fuck about the niggas that you say you hate
You know that I’m the best when I’m a-fake-tionate
I'm the best that you had, face it
J and Keyshia are related: racist
I give you money, then you burn me, then you made off
She ain't a killer, but she'd fucking blow your head off
I know he wondering, ""What the fuck you hiding?""
That we dated like raps about Bin Laden
Ayo, fuck this
Are we dating? Are we fucking?
Are we best friends? Are we something? In between that?

Now, I ain’t got no kids yet, but this right here’s for practice
I hate to get the seats in the Benz wet
But that’s how good your ass is
Make an old man get his glasses, make Wesley pay his taxes
Then follow your moves all week on Twitter
Probably make a gay nigga reconsider
You now rockin' with the best, mane
Dress game down to the sex game
Won’t brag, but the boy been blessed, mane
Let you play with the stick; Ovechkin

Gotta tell your old boyfriend skate, girl
‘Cause a nigga don’t play them ex games
Nope! Straight sexing, no handcuff or arresting
And I ain’t coming off of my last name
‘Cause I really can’t take no stressing

70,I'm Gonna Love You Through It,"[Verse 1]
She dropped the phone and burst into tears
The doctor just confirmed her fears
Her husband held it in and held her tight
Cancer don’t discriminate or care if you’re just 38
With three kids who need you in their lives
He said, ""I know that you’re afraid and I am, too
But you’ll never be alone, I promise you""

[Chorus]
When you’re weak, I’ll be strong
When you let go, I’ll hold on
When you need to cry, I swear that I’ll be there to dry your eyes
When you feel lost and scared to death
Like you can’t take one more step
Just take my hand, together we can do it
I'm going to love you through it

[Verse 2]
She made it through the surgery fine
They said they caught it just in time
But they had to take more than they planned
Now it's forced smiles and baggy shirts
To hide what the cancer took from her
But she just wants to feel like a woman again
She said, ""I don't think I can do this anymore""
He took her in his arms and said ""That's what my love is for""

[Chorus]
When you’re weak, I’ll be strong
When you let go, I’ll hold on
When you need to cry, I swear that I’ll be there to dry your eyes
When you feel lost and scared to death
Like you can’t take one more step
Just take my hand, together we can do it
I'm going to love you through it
Oh baby
Yeah

And when this road gets too long
I'll be the rock you lean on

Girl, how could we get that way?

[Verse 1: Wale]
Look, another day, another dollar
She hate me when I leave cause when I leave I never call her
That's life, shit, aight, shit, I could call you right quick
But if I call, you gon' be like, ""Boo, why we haven't skyped yet?""
And on Skype, bet you say, ""'Le, where my flight at?""
If I decline then you inquire on where I spend my nights at
Shit this life gets overwhelming and more then hectic
But a woman worth some anger is certainly worth some effort
Just look closer, my life is quite deceptive
Women'll sell they soul, just to buy some attention
I need something to hold, fuck that passive aggression
And when I'm back from off that road, don't ask me no questions
Please, fear what you don't know, haha

[Verse 2: Wale]
Don't remember how I met her, but I know I won't forget her
And If loving her is wrong then I just know I won't see Heaven
She say she from Seattle, she 20 and some change
Before I get to T.I.A, I'm sure to make her rain
Then I'm back up on my plane, Chi-town O'Hare
We spend some time and get some wine, have some milds from Harold's
I told her this here's overrated, but I love your city baby
Gotta get back to the D, you know we finally famous
Driver drop me off at Dulles, I'm headed to some money
TSA be laughing, all them rubbers in your luggage
I know I'ma always leave 'em, but I swear I'll always love 'em
Tell her you'll probably find someone but you'll never find another
Wale, oww!

Got on my suede shoes, I'm in a great mood
Air baggage claim, awaiting miss thang out of St. Louis
Know she shining bright, got on my Cartier
She my Billie Jean, we menage with Mary Jane
See we city hop, Vegas to LA
Brings a lot of joy, Bugatti boy, that's lane to lane
Our faucets used to drip, I used to ride the bench
But it was written in cursive for this king to exist
Packed her bags now she live amongst entrepreneurs
Marc Jacob the makeup, she Givenchy consumer

Stars coming out
Baby look at you now
God knows how long but it's been a while
Since I heard you laugh and I seen that smile
Felt that kiss and I can get used to this
Baby I could get used to this

[Chorus]
You could be a blackbird
On the country street
Hiding from the world with a broken wing
But you better believe you're going to fly with me
You could be a songbird from New Orleans
Scared of the rain just as scared to sing
But you better believe you're going to fly with me

[Outro]
You're going to fly",Keith Urban,2011,"[79, 91]",2
78,Wish You Were Here,"[Spoken Intro]
— And disciplinary remains mercifully
Yes and um, I’m with you Derek, this star nonsense
Yes, yes
Now which is it?
I am sure of it

[Acoustic Guitar Intro]

[Verse 1]
So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail
A smile from a veil
Do you think you can tell?

[Verse 2]
Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts
Hot ashes for trees
Hot air for a cool breeze
Cold comfort for change
Did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

[Chorus]
How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls, swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
What have we found?
The same old fears
Wish you were here",Pink Floyd,2011,"[80, 84, 99]",3
79,Better Than I Used To Be,"[Verse 1]
I know how to hold a grudge
I can send a bridge up in smoke
And I can't count the people I've let down, the hearts I've broke
You ain't gotta dig too deep
If you wanna find some dirt on me
I'm learning who you've been
Ain't who you've got to be
It's gonna be an uphill climb
Aw honey I won't lie

[Chorus]
I ain't no angel
I still got a few more dances with the devil
I’m cleaning up my act little by little
I’m getting there
I can finally stand the man in the mirror I see
I ain’t as good as I’m gonna get
But I’m better than I used to be

[Verse 2]
I’ve pinned a lot of demons to the ground
I’ve got a few old habits left
But there’s still one or two I might need you to help me get
Standing in the rain so long has left me with a little rust
But put some faith in me
And someday you’ll see
There’s a diamond under all this dust

[Chorus]
I ain't no angel
I still got a few more dances with the devil
I’m cleaning up my act little by little
I’m getting there
I can finally stand the man in the mirror I see
I ain’t as good as I’m gonna get
But I’m better than I used to be

[Chorus]
I ain't no angel
I still got a few more dances with the devil
I’m cleaning up my act little by little
I’m getting there
I can finally stand the man in the mirror I see
I ain’t as good as I’m gonna get
But I’m better than I used to be",Tim McGraw,2011,[81],1
80,Shake It Out,"[Verse 1]
Regrets collect like old friends
Here to relive your darkest moments
I can see no way, I can see no way
And all of the ghouls come out to play
And every demon wants his pound of flesh
But I like to keep some things to myself
I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn

And I've been a fool and I've been blind
I can never leave the past behind
I can see no way, I can see no way
I'm always dragging that horse around
All of his questions, such a mournful sound
Tonight I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground
Cause I like to keep my issues drawn
But it's always darkest before the dawn

[Chorus]
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa

[Verse 2]
And I am done with my graceless heart
So tonight I'm gonna cut it out and then restart
Cause I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn

[Chorus]
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa (shake him off)

[Verse 3]
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
(shake him off)
And given half the chance, would I take any of it back
(shake him off)
It's a fine romance but it's left me so undone
(shake him off)
It's always darkest before the dawn
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa

[Bridge]
And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
So here's to drinks in the dark at the end of my rope
And I'm ready to suffer and I'm ready to hope
It's a shot in the dark aimed right at my throat
'Cause looking for heaven, found the devil in me (whoa)
Looking for heaven, found the devil in me (whoa)
Well, what the hell, I'm gonna let it happen to me
Yeah

[Chorus]
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh whoa

81,Bait A Hook,"[Verse 1]
I heard you had to drive him home after two umbrella drinks
I heard he's got a Prius, because he's into being green
My buddies said he saw y'all, eating that sushi stuff
Baby that don't sound like you, that don't sound like love
Sounds like it sucks

[Chorus]
He can't even bait a hook
He can't even skin a buck
He don't know who Jack Daniels is
He ain't ever drove a truck
Knows how to throw out a line
But not the kind in a field and stream book
No darling I ain't even worried, you'll come running back
He can't even bait a hook

[Verse 2]
Has he kissed you in a hay field as the summer rain falls down?
Has he took you to meet his mama, back in his home town?
Does he drive the interstate, or does he take them old back roads?
Can he melt your heart with a country song, every good old boy should know?
I didn't think so

[Chorus]
He can't even bait a hook
He can't even skin a buck
He don't know who Jack Daniels is
He ain't ever drove a truck
Knows how to throw out a line
But not the kind in a field and stream book
No darling I ain't even worried, you'll come running back
He can't even bait a hook

[Bridge]
It won't be that long, until you start getting bored
I'll be smiling on the river, reeling in one more

[Chorus]
He can't even bait a hook
He can't even skin a buck
He don't know who Jack Daniels is
He ain't ever drove a truck
Knows how to throw out a line
But not the kind in a field and stream book
No darling I ain't even worried, you'll come running back
He can't even bait a hook

[Outro]
No baby I ain't even worried
He can't even bait a hook",Justin Moore,2011,"[83, 87, 100]",3
82,The Trouble With Girls,"[Verse 1]
The trouble with girls is they’re a mystery
Something about ’em puzzles me
Spent my whole life trying to figure out
Just what them girls are all about
The trouble with girls is they're so dang pretty
Everything about ’em does something to me
But I guess that’s the way it’s supposed to be

[Chorus]
They smile, that smile
They bat those eyes
They steal you with ""hello""
They kill you with ""goodbye""
They hook you with one touch and you can’t break free
Yeah, the trouble with girls is nobody loves trouble as much as me

[Verse 2]
They’re sugar and spice and angel wings
And hell on wheels and tight blue jeans
A summer night, down by the lake
An old memory that you can’t shake
They’re hard to find, yet there’s so many of ’em
The way that you hate, that you already love ’em
But I guess that’s the way it’s supposed to be

[Chorus]
They smile, that smile
They bat those eyes
They steal you with ""hello""
They kill you with ""goodbye""
They hook you with one touch and you can’t break free
Yeah, the trouble with girls is nobody loves trouble as much as me

[Bridge]
The way they hold you out on the dance floor
The way they ride in the middle of your truck
The way they give you a kiss at the front door
Leave you wishing you could have gone up
And just as you walk away
You hear that sweet voice say…
Stay

[Chorus]
They smile, that smile
They bat those eyes
They steal you with ""hello""
They kill you with ""goodbye""
They hook you with one touch and you can’t break free
Yeah, the trouble with girls is nobody loves trouble as much as me",Scotty McCreery,2011,"[84, 75, 95, 93, 98, 84]",6
83,Storm Warning,"[Verse 1]
She rolled in from the west in a summer sun dress
Hotter than the heat in July
With her wind-blown hair; it just wasn't fair
The way she was blowin' my mind
Have you ever noticed every hurricane
Gets its name from a girl like this?
She's a cat five kind, keeps you up at night
Hangin' on to the edge of a kiss

[Pre-Chorus 1]
She's a beautiful mess
Yeah, the kind you love to love
But what happens next?
I got a feelin' when the sun comes up

[Chorus]
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warnin'
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
I'm gonna wish I had a little heads up
A little leeway, a little more time
Some kind of radar system locked in on love
I got a feelin' by the time the night finds the mornin'
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warnin'
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warnin'

[Verse 2]
Ain't it funny how it feels when you're burning your wheels
Somewhere between going and gone?
You get so lost that you can't turn it off
You give in and you just turn it on
She's a heart full of rain, red lips like a flame
She's a girl from your favorite song

[Pre-Chorus 2]
What a beautiful mess
One part angel, one part perfect, one part a wreck
The kind of flood you'll never forget

[Chorus]
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warnin'
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
I'm gonna wish I had a little heads up
A little leeway, a little more time
Some kind of radar system locked in on love
I got a feelin' by the time the night finds the mornin'
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warnin'
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warnin'

[Bridge]
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warnin'
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
I'm gonna wish I had a little heads up
A little leeway, a little more time
Some kind of radar system locked in on love

[Chorus]
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warnin'
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
I'm gonna wish I had a little heads up
A little leeway, a little more time
Some kind of radar system locked in on love
I got a feelin' by the time the night finds the mornin'
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warnin'
Yeah, I'm gonna wish I had a storm warnin'
I'm gonna wish I had a sign, gonna wish I had a sign
Of a storm warnin', yeah

[Outro]
A little heads up, little more time
Little leeway some kind of sign (some kind of sign)
Oh, would've been nice
Some kind of radar system
If I heard it, yeah, I would've listened

She pulls me in enough to keep me guessing (Mmmm)
And maybe I should stop and start confessing, confessing, yeah

Dead-end streets and boulevards

But there's a first time for everything
Who would've thought you'd feel so cold
And all these memories seem so old
To think you were my everything

[Pre-Chorus]
Remember when we'd talk all night
But time ain't easy on us, how can love die?

[Chorus]
I got so much shit to say
But I can't help feeling like I'm camouflage
Fortress around my heart
You were mine just yesterday
Now I have no idea who you are
It's like you camouflage

[Post-Chorus]
But it's good to see you here again
I don't wanna say goodbye
But it's about half past ten
And I have to catch my ride

[Verse 2]
Riding alone on the 405
And life's so fragile, it's like I could cry
If that's the last time I'd see you again
But I'll never tell you just how I felt
You might just not care, and it might just not help
What if the feelings just don't make no sense to you, you

[Pre-Chorus]
Remember when we'd talk all night
But time ain't easy on us, how can love die?

90,Do They Know It's Christmas?,"[Paul Young]
It's Christmas time
There's no need to be afraid
At Christmas time
We let in light and we banish shade

[Boy George]
And in our world of plenty
We can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world
At Christmas time

[George Michael]
But say a prayer
Pray for the other ones
At Christmas time it's hard

[Simon LeBon (Duran Duran)]
But when you're having fun
There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear

Where the only water flowing
Is the bitter sting of tears

And the Christmas bells that ring there
Are the clanging chimes of doom

[Bono]
Well tonight thank God it's them
Instead of you

[Boy George & Others]
And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life(Oooh)
Where nothing ever grows
No rain or rivers flow
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

94,A Woman Like You,"Last night, outta the blue
Driftin' off to the evening news
She said ""Honey, what would you do
If you'd never met me""
I just laughed, said ""I don't know
But I could take a couple guesses though""
And then tried to dig real deep
Said, ""Darling honestly...

I'd do a lot more offshore fishin'
I'd probably eat more drive-thru chicken
Take a few strokes off my golf game
If I'd have never known your name
I'd still be driving that old green 'Nova
I probably never would have heard of yoga
Be a better football fan
But if I was a single man
Alone and out there on the loose
Well I'd be looking for a woman like you.""

I could tell that got her attention
So I said, ""Oh yeah, I forgot to mention
I wouldn't trade a single day
For 100 years the other way.""
She just smiled and rolled her eyes,
Cause she's heard all of my lines
I said, ""C'mon on girl, seriously
If I hadn't been so lucky

I'd be shootin' pool in my bachelor pad
Playing bass in my cover band
Restocking up cold Bud Light
For poker every Tuesday night
Yeah I'd have a dirtbike in the shed
And not one throw pillow on the bed
I'd keep my cash in a coffee can
But if I was a single man
Alone and out there on the loose
Well I'd be looking for a woman like you.""

She knows what a mess
I'd be if I didn't have her here
But to be sure
I whispered in her ear

""You know I get sick deep-sea fishin'
And you make the best fried chicken
I got a hopeless golf game
I love the sound of your name
I might miss that old green 'Nova
But I love watchin' you do yoga
I'd take a gold band on my hand
Over being a single man
Cause honestly
I don't know what I'd do
If I'd never met a woman like you.""",Lee Brice,2011,[96],1

For one more chance to hold you close

I don't know where you're going (Let's go, yeah)
Just get your ass back home

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
We both knew this type of life didn't come with instructions (No)
So I'm trying to do my best to make something out of nothing
And sometimes it gets down right shitty in fact
When you call and I don't even know what city I'm at
Or what day of the week in the middle of the month
In a year I don't recall
It's like my life's on repeat and the last time we spoke I told you I wouldn't be long
That was last November now December's almost gone
I'd apologize, but I don't realize what I'm doing wrong
I never know

[Chorus: Neon Hitch & (Travie McCoy)]
I don't know where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door (That's love, yeah)

I don't know where you're going (Uh-huh, ok, what's that?)
Just get your ass back home

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
And you've been nothing but amazing and I'll never take that for granted
Half of these birds would've flew the coop but you, you truly understand it
And the fact you stood beside me every time you heard some bogusness (Tough love)
You deserve a standing O cause they'd have just been over it
Let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk
Like we don't hear what they saying
Let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk
We'll just drive by and keep waving
'Cause you and I above all that, just let 'em wallow in it
And now they all choked up, yuck - 'cause they be swallowin' it

I don't know where you're going (Yeah)
Or when you're coming home (Alright)
I left the keys under the mat (I'm coming home, mama)

You keep doing that, I'll keep doing this

As long as I'm the one, no
I don't care why you're leaving
You'll miss me when you're gone

The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless
That should send me running
But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me
Just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Verse 2]
My mind forgets to remind me
You're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk

And I love how you look when you blazin'
And I swear you turn at least half-Asian
And we about to have a liaison

You should just go and throw a cape on (Whoa)
And it's just so amazing
So amazing, so amazing
Take it to the car, bloop, bloop
That shit look like I'm speed racing
Leavin' with me, it'll boost your reputation

113,I'm The Only One,"[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man it's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given, much is tested
Get arrested guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do, act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry, more Louis V
My Momma couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel man
I ain't one of the Cosby's, I ain't go to Hillman
I guess the money should've changed him
I guess I should've forgot where I came from

You say I'm crazy
Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

Let up the suicide doors
This is my life homie, you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldn't tell ya who decide wars
So I parallel double parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking bout back in my day
But homie this is my day, class started 2 hours ago
Oh am I late? No, I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh they so sensitive
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon' end up apologing
Let me know if it's a problem then, aight man, holla then

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Let the champagne splash
Let that man get cash
Let that man get past
He don't even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors
He can drive off of fumes cause
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure, what's your pleasure?
Life is a, Uh, depending how you dress her
So if the devil wear Prada, Adam Eve wear nada
I'm in between but way more fresher
With way less effort, cause when you try hard
That's when you die hard
Your homies looking like why God
When they reminisce over you, my God

Everywhere you go;
Take a look at the five and ten

With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

[Verse 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

[Chorus 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week; I'll explain
Havin' a hard time adjustin' to fame

Something beginning with 'S'

On candy stripe legs the Spiderman comes
Softly through the shadow of the evening sun
Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead
Looking for the victim shivering in bed
Searching out fear in the gathering gloom
And suddenly a movement in the corner of the room
And there is nothing I can do when I realize with fright
That the Spiderman is having me for dinner tonight

[Verse 2]
Quietly he laughs and shaking his head
Creeps closer now, closer to the foot of the bed
And softer than shadow and quicker than flies
His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes
Be still, be calm, be quiet now, my precious boy
Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more
For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light
The Spiderman is having you for dinner tonight

And I feel like I'm being eaten
By a thousand million shivering furry holes
And I know that in the morning
I will wake up in the shivering cold
And the Spiderman is always hungry

You look down at your ring
You slowly slip it off and then
You lay it on our bed
Maybe I should pick it up
And get down on my knees
Tell you what you wanna hear
And give you what you need

131,El Verdadero Amor Perdona,"Tienes todos los espacios
Inundados de tu ausencia
Inundados de silencio
No hay palabras, no hay perdón

Tu me tienes olvidado
No respondes al llamado
No eches tierra a la palabra
Me condenas a la nada
No me entierres sin perdón

Mira corazón que es el engaño
Se revierte y hace daño
Se revienta en el aire
Como pompas de jabón

Como pude haberte yo herido
Engañarte y ofendido
Alma gemela no te olvido
Aunque me arranque el corazón

Ay! el rencor que nos envenena
Nos hace daño
Aunque no regreses corazón
Has de perdonarme

El verdadero amor perdona
No abandona, no se quiebra
No aprisiona, no revienta
Como pompas de jabón

Un error es algo humano
No justifico la traición
Los amantes verdaderos
Se comprenden, se aman
Y se olvidan del rencor

La noche empieza a amotinarse
De sueños rotos y el dolor
Y me revuelco en la cama
Aferrándome a la nada
Implorando tu perdón

Mira corazón cuanto te extraño
Pasan días, pasan años
Y mi vida se revienta
Como pompas de jabón

Como pude haberte yo herido
Engañarte y ofendido
Alma gemela no te olvido
Aunque me arranque el corazón

Ay! el rencor que nos envenena
Nos hace daño
Aunque no regreses corazón
Has de perdonarme

El verdadero amor perdona
No abandona, no se quiebra
No aprisiona, no revienta
Como pompas de jabón

El verdadero amor perdona
El verdadero amor perdona
Si el amor es verdadero
No se quiebra, no abandona
Si el amor es verdadero
No se quiebra, no abandona",Prince Royce,2011,[100],1
132,Crazy Girl,"[Verse 1]
Baby why you wanna cry?
You really oughta know that I
Just have to walk away sometimes
We’re gonna do what lovers do
We’re gonna have a fight or two
But I ain’t ever changin’ my mind

[Chorus]
Crazy girl, don’t you know that I love you?
And I wouldn’t dream of goin’ nowhere
Silly woman, come here, let me hold you
Have I told you lately?
I love you like crazy, girl

[Verse 2]
Wouldn’t last a single day
I’d probably just fade away
Without you, I’d lose my mind
Before you ever came along
I was livin’ life all wrong
Smartest thing I ever did was make you all mine

[Chorus]
Crazy girl, don’t you know that I love you?
And I wouldn’t dream of goin’ nowhere
Silly woman, come here, let me hold you
Have I told you lately?
I love you like crazy, girl
Like crazy, girl

[Chorus]
Crazy girl, don’t you know that I love you?
And I wouldn’t dream of goin’ nowhere
Silly woman, come here, let me hold you
Have I told you lately?
I love you like
Crazy, girl, don’t you know that I love you?
I wouldn’t dream of goin’ nowhere

133,Country Must Be Country Wide,"[Verse 1]
I grew up south of the Mason Dixon
Working spitting hunting and fishing
Stone cold country by the grace of God
I was gasing up the other day
And an ol' boy pulled up with a license plate
From Ohio I thought oh good lord he's lost
From his wranglers to his boots
He reminded me of Chris LeDoux
And that Copenhagen smile

[Chorus 1]
Country must be country wide
In every state
There's a station
Playing Cash, Hank, Willie, and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives

[Chorus 2]
There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide

[Verse 2]
It ain't where
It's how you live
We weren't raised to take
We were raised to give
The shirt off our back
To anyone in need
We bow our heads before we eat
Before we start our day
Before we fall asleep
Cause in God we trust and we believe
And we see what's wrong
And we know what's right
And all Hank he said it all
When he said country folks can survive

[Chorus 1]
Country must be country wide
In every state
There's a station
Playing Cash, Hank, Willie, and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives

[Chorus 2]
There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide

[Chorus 1]
Country must be country wide
In every state
There's a station
Playing Cash, Hank, Willie, and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives

[Chorus 2]
There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide

134,If This Was A Movie,"Last night I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on the stairs
Six months gone, I’m still reaching
Even though I know you’re not there
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
Thinkin’ ’bout everythin’ we’ve been through
Maybe I’ve been goin’ back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you
So come back, come back, come back to me-e like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside ’til I came out
So come back, come back, come back to me-e like
You could, you could if you just said you’re sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you’d be here by now
I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughing
‘Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Now, I’m pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me
“Nothing’s gonna change, not for me and you”
And then before I knew how much I had to lose
Come back, come back, come back to me-e like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside ’til I came out
So come back, come back, come back to me-e like
You could, you could if you just said you’re sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you’d be here by now
If you’re out there, if you’re somewhere, if you’re moving on
I’ve been waiting for you ever since you’ve been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just wanna see you back at my front door
Come back, come back, come back to me-e like
You did before you said it’s not that easy
Before the fight, before I left you out
But I’d take it all back now
Come back, come back, come back to me-e like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside ’til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me-e like
You could, you could if you just said you’re sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you’d be here by now
You’d be here by now
Come back, come back, come back to me-e
Come back, come back, come back to me-e
You’d be here by now",Maddi Jane,2011,"[53, 10]",2
135,Hate Sleeping Alone,"[Verse 1]
She says ""kiss me like you miss me, fuck me like you hate me
And when you’re fucking someone else just fuck her like she ain't me""
Damn, those words are scary, those words are scary virgin Mary
I just tell her to spare me
I was in love 2 years ago and gave the baggage to my ex
It’s all for her to carry, bags she deserve to carry
I hate that ho, I make it so hard just to talk, don’t I?
I get off topic don’t I? I get it poppin’ don’t I?
I’ll end up stopping won’t I? And by the time I end up stopping
You’ll be rocking one of the rings you pointed out while shopping with a nigga don’t lie
She’s losing it right now, 'cause if I wasn't who I am, she would've been moving in by now
But instead we're moving slow -- I guess she's used to it by now
And she gives me all her trust and I'm abusing it right now
But this money coming in is just confusing shit right now
You just told me I ain't shit and I guess I'm proving it right now

[Chorus]
I'd rather be with you, but you are not around
So I'ma call somebody up and see if they be down
'Cause I hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
So she’s here and we're both so gone

[Verse 2]
Hotel to hotel, girl - I could use your company
Full name and birthday, I book a flight, you come to me
But she don't want a weekend - she wants all of me or none of me
If she can't work with all of me then she say she done with me
You say that you over me you always end up under me
You know how it goes - don't be crazy, don't play dumb with me
Don't start with yo' shit - I put you back in your place
She tells me ""I bet you won't, you won't say that to my face""
And hang up yeah, how dare you tell me it's tougher for you
Like I don't hear about the niggas you fucking with, too
And whoever I be with, they got nothing on you
That's just something to do when there's nothing to do
Yeah, but she's losing it right now
She has choices she should make I think she's choosing it right now
One more chance to make it right, I think I'm using it right now
You just said I never learn I guess I'm proving it right now

[Chorus]
I'd rather be with you, but you are not around
So I'ma call somebody up and see if they be down
'Cause I hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
So she’s here and we're both so gone",Drake,2011,[67],1

138,Criminal,"[Intro]
A lot of people ask me stupid fuckin' questions
A lot of people think that what I say on a record
Or what I talk about on a record
That I actually do in real life or that I believe in it
Or if I say that I wanna kill somebody
That I'm actually gonna do it or that I believe in it
Well, shit, if you believe that, then I'll kill you
You know why? ‘Cause I'm a criminal!
Criminal! You're goddamn right
I'm a criminal! Yeah, I'm a criminal!

[Verse 1]
My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
That'll stab you in the head, whether you're a fag or lez
Or a homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest
Pants or dress, hate fags? The answer's yes
Homophobic? Nah, you're just heterophobic
Starin' at my jeans, watchin' my genitals bulgin' (Ooh!)
That's my motherfuckin' balls, you'd better let go of 'em
They belong in my scrotum, you'll never get hold of 'em!
""Hey, it's me, Versace! Whoops, somebody shot me!
And I was just checkin' the mail, get it? Checkin' the male?""
How many records you expectin' to sell
After your second LP sends you directly to jail?
Come on, relax, guy! I like gay men
Right, Ken? Give me an amen! (A-men!)
""Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus
Heal this child, help us destroy these demons
Oh, and please send me a brand new car
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital""
Preacher, preacher! Fifth grade teacher!
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither
You can't teach me a goddamn thing ‘cause
I watch TV and Comcast cable
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from toppin' these charts
And you can't stop me from droppin' each March
With a brand new CD for these fuckin' retards (Duh)
And to think, it's just little ol' me
Mr. Don't-Give-a-Fuck still won't leave

[Chorus]
I'm a criminal!
‘Cause every time I write a rhyme these people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal!
I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one
I'm a criminal!
‘Cause every time I write a rhyme these people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal!
I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one

[Verse 2]
The mother did drugs, hard liquor, cigarettes and speed
The baby came out, disfigured ligaments, indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Don't dare make fun of that baby, ‘cause that baby was me
I'm a criminal, an animal caged who turned crazed
But how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger
I drank more liquor to fuck you up quicker
Than you'd wanna fuck me up for sayin' the word—
My morals went *thhbbpp* when the president got oral
Sex in his Oval Office on top of his desk off of his own employee
Now, don't ignore me, you won't avoid me
You can't miss me: I'm white, blonde-haired, and my nose is pointy
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
In plane crashes and laughs as long as it ain't happenin' to him
Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Em-
-inem and Kim combined (The maniac's in)
In place of the Doctor ‘cause Dre couldn't make it today
He's a little under the weather, so I'm takin' his place (Mm-mm-mmm!)
Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
I told you, Dre, you should've kept that thang put away
I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh?
I'm a criminal!

Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it (Go, go, go!)
So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it
So I'll be disguised in it and if anybody identifies
The guy in it, I hide for five minutes
Come back, shoot the eyewitness
Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
Die bitches, bastards, brats, pets
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet
If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts
Tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck
You motherfuckin' chickens ain't brave enough
To say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut
Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up
To make you mad, so kiss my white naked ass
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as
I'ma be a fuckin' rapist in a Jason mask

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, never thoughts of suicide, I'm too alive
But I still treat it likes it's do or die
Even though dying isn't in the plans
But neither was making it and here I am
In the Presidential -- do you like your new room?
Always presidential and tonight's no blue moon
Since I saw Aaliyah's precious life go too soon
She deserve the credit for how I'm about to get it
That's why I got a new dumb thing moving through the street, got a new condo, move it to the beach
Heard Nicki just bought a brand new crib, goddamn, man, she's beauty and the beast (Lord)
Seems like yesterday that I was up and coming
Still so young that I ain't had enough of nothing
The fam here, the drink here
The girls here?
Well, fuck, let's get it then

[Hook: Drake]
I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double, you ain't even gotta ask, Ahh
Because it's hard to say no (say no)
Yeah, it gets hard to say no
Are you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, every time, every time, every time, every time
Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine, We’ll be fine
We’ll be fine, We’ll be fine
Are you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, every time, every time, every time, every time

Used to make us proud -- we had dreams of getting bigger, man
Loved you until now, but now I'm the nigga, man
You keep talking that, ""You was this and you had this""
And you deserve some fucking credit how did anyone forget it
Got a show up in your city, yo girl is in the line
And the line around the corner, it's my motherfucking time
You should take it as a sign, man I got it right now
I wouldn't doubt it cause these bitches all about it right now
Let's be real about this shit, can I take you home?
Or come to where you stay? Do you live on your own?
I heard you got your ways, I never would have known
She said, ""you're such a dog"", I said, ""you're such a bone.""
I've been everywhere, where you know me from?
These days women give it to me like they owe me one
But they crave attention, though, they always saying, ""show me some""
But girl you ain't the only one that's trying to be the only one
At least I admit that, if you get that, and you with that
Then, fuck, let's get it then

You know the bed feels warmer
Sleepin' here alone (Sleepin' here alone)
You know I dream in color
And do the things I want (Do the things I want)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You think you got the best of me
Think you've had the last laugh
Bet you think that everything good is gone
Think you left me broken down
Think that I'll come running back
Baby, you don't know me, 'cause you're dead wrong

[Chorus]
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself, and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

[Verse 2]
You heard that I was starting over with someone new
They told you I was moving on and over you

You didn't think that I'd come back
I'd come back swinging
You tried to break me, but you see

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger

Thanks to you, I'm not the broken-hearted
Thanks to you I'm finally thinkin' 'bout me

[Verso 1]
Puedo ver en tus ojos
Que estás molesta contigo
Porque han llegao' cuatro hombres
Porque has tenio' un par de amigos
Y ninguno tiene el carácter
Tú sabes lo que digo
Te hace sentir segura
Como lo estabas conmigo
Yo sé eso y más cosas
Que no te gustan las rosas
Y que en las noches oras
Pensando en mi vida peligrosa
¿En dónde estará metio'?
¿Cuál barrio? ¿Cuál caserío?
Con las tipas que llamaban
Cuando estaba al lao' mío
Y te han contao’ de la rubia
La modelo, la que estudia
Y hoy te tomas el tiempo
Mientras ves caer la lluvia
Recordando un segundo
Con sentimiento profundo
El que mueve y detiene
Cada vuelta de tu mundo

[Coro]
Y la forma en que caminas me reflejas a mí
Te peinas y arreglas como me gusta a mí
Y la palabra que usaste, la escuchaste de mí
Es más sube la copa y date un shot por mí
Y la forma en que caminas me reflejas a mí
Te peinas y arreglas como me gusta a mí
Y la palabra que usaste, la escuchaste de mí
Es más sube la copa y date un shot por mí
Y date un shot por mí

[Post-Coro]
Ohoho, date un shot por mí
Ohoho, date un shot por mí

[Verso 2]
Y dale brinda
Mientras le cuentas a las muchachas
Del hombre en el que piensas cada vez que te emborrachas
Por quien cantas Gloria Trevi y Alejandra Guzmán
Hacer el amor con otro
No es lo mismo mi madame
Y si lo hice
Fui el hombre del dolor y cicatrices
Oculté muchos detalles
Pero, baby, sí te quise
Preferí la calle
Te fallé, es cierto lo que aquel dice
Sé quien fuiste
Y quien eres
Si yo también lo hice

[Puente]
Y si lo hice, todo lo hice my girl
El hombre que vive en tu mente
Soy dueño de tu piel
Y sé bien también el daño
Y lo que eres mujer
Se lo debes a este hombre
Y ese shot va por él

[Coro]
Y la forma en que caminas me reflejas a mí
Te peinas y arreglas como me gusta a mí
Y la palabra que usaste, la escuchaste de mí
Es más sube la copay date un shot por mí
Y la forma en que caminas me reflejas a mí
Te peinas y arreglas como me gusta a mí

Mhmmm *inhales*
You high, baby?
Yeah
Yeah?
Talk to me
You want me to tell you something?
Uh-huh
I know what you wanna hear

[Refrain: Eminem (& Dina Rae)]
'Cause I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too
(I think I love you, baby) I think I love you too
I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me, baby, you know I want you too
They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
(Oh boy, you drive me crazy) Bitch, you make me hurl

[Verse 1: Eminem]
They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now: got no ring on this finger now
I'd never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship; save it, bitch!
Babysit? You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl, you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I tell a motherfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips? Bitch, why ask?
Kiss my dick, get my cash?
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out, I'll put you out
Won't get out, I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice? Buy you ice?
Bitch, if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What, you tryin' to be my new wife?
What, you Mariah? Fly through twice

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow

‘Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
It's no secret, everybody knows
Yeah, we fucked: bitch, so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends, I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kinda car I'll be in
We'll see how much you be'll partyin' then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?
I'd never love you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you

First thing you say: I'm not fazed
I hang around big stars all day
I don't see what the big deal is anyway
You're just plain old Marshall to me
Ooh yeah, girl, run that game
Hailie Jade, I love that name
Love that tattoo, what's that say?
""Rot In Pieces,"" uh, that's great
First off, you don't know Marshall
At all, so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave handprints all across you
Good Lordy, whoadie
You must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooh girl, that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two backhands
Put anthrax on a Tampax
And slap you 'til you can't stand
Girl, you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans

145,Lighters,"[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
This one's for you and me
Livin' out our dreams
We are right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters

[Verse 1: Eminem]
By the time you hear this, I will have already spiraled up
I would never do nothin' to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you I would duck, or get struck like lightnin'
Fighters keep fightin', put your lighters up, point 'em skyward, uh
Had a dream, I was king; I woke up, still king
This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking
'Til nobody else even fuckin' feels me, 'til it kills me
I swear to God I'll be the fuckin' illest in this music
There is, or there ever will be, disagree? Feel free
But from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
Only thing I ever gave up's using no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick, but you cocks are slick
Poppin' shit on how you flipped your life around, crock of shit
Who you dicks tryna kid? Flip ""dick,"" you did opposite
You stayed the same 'cause ""cock"" backwards is still ""cock,"" you pricks!
I love it when I tell 'em shove it
‘Cause it wasn’t that long ago when Marshall sat flustered
Lacked luster ‘cause he couldn’t cut mustard
Muster up nothin', brain fuzzy
‘Cause he’s buzzin’, woke up from that buzzer
Now you wonder why he does it how he does it
Wasn’t ‘cause he had buzzards
Circlin' around his head, waitin' for him to drop dead, was it?
Or was it ‘cause some bitches wrote him off?
Little hussy-ass scuzzes
Fuck it, guess it doesn’t matter now, does it?
What difference it make? What’s it take?
To get it through your thick skulls that this ain’t
Some bullshit; people don’t usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switchblade to a hater’s ribcage!
And let it be known from this day forward, I wanna just say
Thanks, ‘cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let them Bics raise, ‘cause I came with 5'9"", but I feel like I’m 6'8""

By the time you hear this, I’ll prob'ly already be outtie
I advance like goin' from totin' iron to goin' and buyin’
Four or five of the homies the Iron Man Audi
My daddy told me: ""Slow down, boy, you're goin' to blow it!""
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute to tell Shady I love him
The same way that he did Dr. Dre on The Chronic
Tell him how real he is, or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him, for him to know it
I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I write 'til he can march right
Into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career's LeBron's Jersey in twenty years
I stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up, it's 'bout to be a scary drop
‘Cause what goes up must come down
You goin' down on somethin' you don't wanna see, like a hairy box
Every hour, happy hour now, life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cat's meow, oow, outclass the count
Always down for the catchweight like Pacquiao
Y'all are doomed
I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself, and auto-tunes
‘Cause now I'm in the Aston; I went from havin'
My city locked up to gettin' treated like Kwame Kilpatrick
And now I'm fantastic, compare it to a weed high
And y'all niggas that's gossipin' like bitches
On a radio and TV, see me, we fly
Y'all buggin' out like Wendy Williams starin' at a beehive
And how real is that? I remember signin' my first deal
Now I'm the second best, I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag

[Bridge: Bruno Mars]
You and I know what it's like
To be kicked down, forced to fight
But tonight, we're all right
So hold up your lights
Let it shine, 'cause—

On the map, illest city out, I guess that's just a fact
I'ma live in Rome, drink Patron and have a ball

149,Party On Fifth Ave.,"[Verse 1: Murphy’s Law]

I can’t remember where the party was
Can’t remember what happened
All I remember is the DJ changed my song
And started clapping
Guys got to leaning, and snapping
Then me and Freeland, started rapping
Don’t think it was a costume party
But I ended up the captain
I’m not going to lie;
I’m having a little trouble recapping
A little flame up in your game
Is what you’re lacking
No, I haven’t had a Miller
But, Imma get to mackin’
The way I poke her (poker)
I get them chips stacking
If you’re acting lame in here
I’ll send your ass packing
I run it up in this bitch; tracking
And I spit a little fire on that verse; dragon

[Chorus: Murphy’s Law]

I’m not too sure what happened
I don’t where I am
Woke up at five thirty
With a girl that’s kinda pretty
Get up, get dressed
Feeling like the man
Take a look around at all the damage
Kick a few beer cans
And I can easily say that this party turned out
A little better than it was planned

[Verse 2: Cody Freeland]

I came to party all night
Yeah, I’m a man on a mission
I see some people
Playing beer pong in the kitchen
This is the party of my dreams
One helluva of night to be living
From the window to the Wale, (wall, hey);
Ambition
Free drinks for all the ladies
Not trying to make commission
We do this every weekend
You can call it a tradition
Another keg just arrived
What a nice addition
Now watch that beer disappear
Magician
Spilled my drink on a lady
She started to cuss me
People worried about the police
So, they all started fussing
The cops aren’t going to come
You all can trust me
If not, then suck my balls
Jerry Sandusky

[Chorus: Cody Freeland]

[Breakdown: Murphy’s Law]

Been having the time of my life
And I’d never change that
I don’t know where it went
I don’t know how
But somehow I lost my hat
But looking at the time I had
I don’t even want that shit back
I really wanna do it again, so I ask my boys
“Where’s the party at?”

You're all I need, all of me on my knees

We fightin', we might need counseling
Possibly moreso me
Sounds to me frowns'll be grounds to leave
Hounds'll be lookin' for you before you drop a tear, apres diem
Stop pretending that I ain't him
I ain't them, dim sum dumpling
I remember when you start dyeing them silver hairs
And start hiding from your age
I ask, ""Why? How come?""
Amazin' how time can run away from us
I'm no nun, you're no priest, but I promise, hun, you gon' see

I'm begging now, pretty please with cherries on top
Hairy wet twat
Harriet Tub-man, I don't give up
And if your gut tells you to strut, then strut
Then I'll hail you a car, but what man won't beg?
You know I'm nutmeg
I will show up on a lil' moped
With a lil' puppy, it'll be fluffy
You will un-toughen, we can discuss it
You know I'm sufferin', I do miss my friend
I don't like my fin bent up, Tilikum, well, that's ill-informed

151,Cost Of Livin',"[Verse 1]
I was just a normal guy, life was just a nine to five
With bills and pressure, piled up to the sky
She never asked, she knew I'd been, hangin' with my wilder friends
Lookin' for some other way to fly

[Verse 2]
And three days straight was no big feat, could get by with no food or sleep
And crazy was becomin' my new norm
I'd pass out on the bedroom floor
And sleep right through the calm before the storm

[Chorus]
My life was just an old routine, every day the same damn thing
I couldn't even tell I was alive
I tell you, the high cost of livin'
Ain't nothin' like the cost of livin' high

[Verse 3]
That southern Baptist parkin' lot, was where I'd go to smoke my pot
An' sit there in my pickup truck and pray
Starin' at that giant cross, just reminded me that I was lost
And it just never seemed to point the way

[Verse 4]
As soon as Jesus turned his back, I'd find my way across the tracks
Lookin' just to score, another deal
With my back against that damn eightball
I didn't have to think or talk, or feel

[Chorus]
My life was just an old routine, every day the same damn thing
I couldn't even tell I was alive
I tell you, the high cost of livin'
Ain't nothin' like the cost of livin' high

[Verse 5]
My whole life went through my head, layin' in that motel bed
Watchin' as the cops kicked in the door
I had a job and a piece of land, my sweet wife was my best friend
But I traded that for cocaine and a whore

[Verse 6]
With my new found sobriety, I've got the time to sit and think
Of all the things I had, and threw away
This prison is much colder than
That one that I was locked up in just yesterday

[Chorus]
My life is just an old routine, every day the same damn thing
Hell I can't even tell if I'm alive
I tell you, the high cost of livin'
Ain't nothin' like the cost of livin' high

153,Here For A Good Time,"[Verse 1]
I am not gonna lay around and whine and moan for somebody that done me wrong
Don't think for a minute that I am gonna sit around and sing some old sad song
I believe it's half full not a half empty glass
Every day I wake up knowing it could be my last

[Chorus]
I ain't here for a long time
I'm here for a good time
So bring on the sunshine, to hell with the red wine
Pour me some moonshine
When I'm gone put it in stone ""He left nothing behind""
I ain't here for a long time
I'm here for a good time

[Verse 2]
Folks are always dreaming about what they like to do but I like to do just what I like
I take the chance, dance the dance, it might be wrong but then again it might be right
There's no way of knowing what tomorrow brings
Life's too short to waste it I say bring on anything

[Chorus]
I ain't here for a long time
I'm here for a good time
So bring on the sunshine, to hell with the red wine

(The winner is Beyoncé Knowles: female pop vocalist!)
I would like to thank the judges for picking me
My parents who I love, I love you, Houston

[Verse 1]
And I've been drifting off on knowledge
Cat-calls on cat-walks, man these women getting solemn
I could sing a song for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wonder:
How come?
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge, I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cause all the shit I hear is boring
All the shit I do is boring, all these record labels boring
I don't trust these record labels, I'm torn
All these people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
All the people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive, how come?

But now you're grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can’t have a man look at you for five seconds

You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart

Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don’t be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and crooks still crook

159,Tonight Tonight,"[Verse 1]
It's been a really, really messed up week
Seven days of torture, seven days of bitter
And my girlfriend went and cheated on me
She's a California dime, but it's time for me to quit her

La, la, la, whatever
La, la, la, it doesn't matter
La, la, la, oh, well

We're going at it tonight, tonight
There's a party on the rooftop top of the world
Tonight, tonight, and we're dancing on the edge of the Hollywood sign
I don't know if I'll make it, but watch how good I'll fake it
It's alright, alright, tonight, tonight

Woke up with a strange tattoo
Not sure how I got it
Not a dollar in my pocket

Horns are honking, I've about had it
I'm looking for an exit sign
Gotta get out of here, get it all off my mind
And like a memory from your grandpa's attic
A song comes slippin' through the radio static
Changing my mood
A little George Strait 1982

And it makes me wanna take a back road
Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind, unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab my honey
Tear down some two-lane country
Who knows
Get lost and get right with my soul
Makes me wanna take
Makes me wanna take a back road

I've been cooped up, tied down, 'bout forgotten
What a field looks like, full of corn and cotton
If I'm gonna hit a traffic jam
Well it better be a tractor man
So sick and tired of this interstate system
I need a curve and wind-a-twistin'
Dusty path to nowhere
With the wind blowing through my baby's hair

Yeah, makes me wanna take a back road
Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind, unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab my honey
Tear down some two-lane country
Who knows
Get lost and get right with my soul
Makes me wanna take
Makes me wanna take a back road
Some old back road

Maybe it's the feeling or maybe it's the freedom
Maybe it's that shady spot
Where we park the truck when the things get hot
Where we park the truck when the things get hot

And it makes me wanna take a back road
Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind, unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab you honey
Tear down some two-lane country
Who knows
Get lost and get right with my soul
Makes me wanna take
Makes me wanna take a back road
Some old back road, get right with my soul

161,Last Friday Night,"[BLAINE]
There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool

I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbecue
Is this a hickey or a bruise?

Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh well...

It's a blacked out blur
But I'm pretty sure
It ruled
Damn

Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a ménage à trois

Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op
Whoa!

But this Friday night
Do it all again
This Friday night
Do it all again

Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor

Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrants out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

164,Ambition,"[Intro: Wale]
The time is now, on everything
Took my heart away from money
I ain't interested in fame
And I pray that never change
Ambition is priceless
It’s something that’s in your veins
And I put that on my name

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Uh, only hope I had was selling dope
Was on my grind cause times was harder than a cellar floor
My momma taught me never steal and never tell on folks
I grew up looking up to niggas that was selling coke
Oh, I was raised by the stop sign
No religion I was getting saved by the Glock nine
By the minute I was getting paid like a hot line
Servin' raw and, fiends was calling, we was dot com
Well connected, well respected and well protected
Ain't get accepted, was rejected and now they regret it
Ain't get my message, was no signal when I was texting
The niggas I was calling was fraud and I learned my lesson
Now I move with aggression, use my mind as a weapon
Cause chances are never given they tooken like interceptions
So throw that pass, I’ll be the cornerback
Me and Folarin MMG gon' bring that Warner back

[Hook: Wale]
For my ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it
They gon' love me for my Ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it
They gon' love me for my Ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it
Look, they gon' love me for my ambition
Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
It speaks for itself
Define ambition for me

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
My ambition to win, just to get me some ends
Help me pay my little rent, maybe sit in a Benz
I saw momma praying as she wait on results
It was hot in the kitchen can I wait on the porch
My father was missing, War Lord Oliver North
Life was diggin’ me deeper, I kept on coming up short
Breaking so many laws, waking up in the dark
Who cut my power off? it’s time to move that powder soft
Not too many options when you coming from the projects
Sittin’ in the trap now you moving Cyndi Lauper
Girls wanna have fun, and a nigga with some change
And I doubt that ever change
Ambition is priceless that’s something that's in your veins
And I doubt that ever change
Ambition is my shit and I put that on my name
And I doubt that ever change

[Hook]
For my ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it
They gon' love me for my Ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it
They gon' love me for my Ambition

Look, they gon' love me for my ambition
Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision

[Verse 3: Wale]
Well wishes to my opposition
You niggas probably cop a plea before you cop a pistol
I got nothing against them, they got fucking potential
But every nigga who can read gotta get his issue
Subscribe, niggas reside where all the lions and killers be
And I ain't spend a minute up in the streets
But I’m limitless mentally, I’m lyrically ZMT
Lebron shit, I was in that 6 after 23
And family is everything, and money is less important
Long as your mama love you, don’t ever love a woman
I got a lot of bitches, they got a lot of feelings
But I got that green on my eyes
And that ain’t no Donnie Simpson
I retire you niggas: fuck you and your position!
They placeholding so slippery niggas can’t even kick it
Y’all rambling, talking shit to these bitches
You know you real you don’t say it
You know you real, we gon feel it
Ralph!

[Outro: Wale]
Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision
They gon love me for my ambition
Easy to dream a dream, but much harder to live it
Look, they gon love me for my ambition
Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision
They gon love me for my ambition",Wale,2011,[81],1

Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum pum
Yeah, I'm on the drum, yeah, I'm on the snare drum
Yeah, I'm on the beat 'cause the beat goes dumb
And I only spit heat 'cause I'm playing for the Son
Playing for the king, playing for the title
I'm surprised you didn't hear this in the Bible
I'm so tight I might go psycho
Christmas time, so here's a recital
I'm so bad like Michael, I know
I'm still young, but I go, I go
Stupid, stupid, love like Cupid
I'm the drummer boy, so do it, do it

Nothing to give our king (Bieber, what up?), pa rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum
(I needa get straight to it)

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Yo, at the table with the family, havin' dinner
BlackBerry on our hip and then it gave a little flicker
Then I took a look to see before it activates the ringer
Came to realize my homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter
Then I hit him back despite I had some food up on my fingers
Sippin' eggnog, with a little sprinkle of vanilla
Even though it's kinda cold, I'm pullin' out a chinchilla
Bieber hit me back and said ""Let's make it hot up in the winter"", I said ""Cool""
You know I'mma deliver
Let's collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger
Before we work, I gotta get this off
See the other family members and drop gifts off
Then I'm headed to the studio 'cause ain't nothing stopping how
You know we 'bout to turn it up and really get it popping now
People everywhere and all our Twitter followers
Merry Christmas, Kwanza, Happy Hanukkah

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Mary nodded, pa rum pa pum pum
The ox and lamb kept time, pa rum pa pum pum
I played my drum for him, pa rum pa pum pum
I played my best for him, pa rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum

[Verse 3: Justin Bieber]
If you wanna give, it's the time of year
JB on the beat, yeah, yeah, I'm on the snare
It's crazy how some people say they, say they don't care
When there's people on the street with no food, it's not fair
It's about time for you to act merrily
It's about time for you to give to charity
Rarely do people even wanna help at all
'Cause they're warm by the fire getting toys and their dolls
Not thinkin' there's a family out hungry and cold
Wishin', wishin' that they had somebody they could hold
So I think some of you need to act bold
Give a can to a drive, let's change the globe, globe, globe, globe, globe

You faker than some Sweet'N Low (Why?)
Yeah, you got some silverware
But really are you eating though? (Yeah)
Are you eating though? Nigga, are you eating though?
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner's for beginners, you ain't even know
Never catching cases, why they faces look so E-M-O?
Watch a hater hate me, wanna play me like a piano
My architect know Japanese (Yeah?)
Your girl, she jockin' these (Yeah?)
No hands like soccer teams and y'all fuck boys like Socrates

Different color, my passport

Ain't nobody—

Top of the holy totem
Ri-ri-ri-rich forever, a million was not the quota

Year off, got no rules, trippin' off of them toadstools
More green than my Whole Foods
And I'm too fly, Jeff Goldblum
Got a glass house in the Palisades, that A-K-A
White hood, white hood, O-KKK
Furniture custom, you shop at IKEA
Show Maserati, you whippin' a Kia
Spendin' this money, it's longer than Nia
Live like a Coppola, me and Sofia
Wakin' up broke, man, wouldn't wanna be ya
Friends with the dopeman, help a nigga re-up
Bring a girlfriend, man, trouble when I see her
“Err-eh-err-eh,” onomatopoeia
Ohh, I got my cool on! (Tailor-made!)
I'm winnin' so they had to dump the Gatorade (Gatorade)
And I don't give a fuck about my family name

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

He's loading lots of toys and many goodies on his sleigh

174,Dedication To My Ex (Miss That),"[Verse 1]
Uh, they provided what I need to set myself apart
A fucking menace, you couldn't deny it from the start
I see 'em grinding but it's not reflected in their art
Guess working hard ain't always working smart
I keep my head down in these pages, let the silence do the talkin'
Got my people in my thoughts, I know that everyone is watching
Ex-girls stalking, new girl awesome
Fucking on the floor and then we yoga bottom shopping (Hol' up)

[Chorus]
Baby tell me not to baby food
Baby tell me not to baby food
Baby tell me not to baby food
Baby tell me not to baby food

[Verse 2]
Intoxicated by my dedication to this life
So many homies turned on me, betrayal has a price
Revenge is futile, you'll understand what I sacrificed
You did it first but I'mma do it right
I keep my stomach full, I'm eating, save that fake shit for you clowns
Used to swim on Etiwanada, my dad's always held it down
Yerek' za, hear the sound, valley raised, talk of the town
I'm killing you niggas got nothing and never will, this summer I'm coming around

[Chorus]
Baby tell me not to baby food
Baby tell me not to baby food
Baby tell me not to baby food
Baby tell me not to baby food

[Verse 3]
Nothin's expected, they're talkin' reckless and reached their limit
High off the praise and the couple people that buy the image
Thought I was finished, you're fuckin' foolish and need to quit it
Shit's infinite, I got 'em waitin' on every sentence and clinging
To every post, hangin' on every word
You never saw this comin' what you witnessed ain't what you heard
Relax and observe, used to chug it down and then swerve
Party hoppin' bending the curve, Ry, I'm whippin', just missin' the curb

[Chorus]
Baby tell me not to baby food
Baby tell me not to baby food
Baby tell me not to baby food
Baby tell me not to baby food

[Verse 4]
Built the foundation, the silly hatred will quickly fade
I have no rivals, my fondest idols are in a grave
We swear we do it for love until we start getting paid
When bills start stackin', passion's just a phase
I pour caffeine in my Contigo 'til I'm wired, Avon
Floating higher, touching planets, smoking green, Draymond
Flow sweet, cinnabon, veggie burger in a bun
Top down on PCH cruising, soaking up the sun
I turn my worries to blessings, taking in all that I question
What you call love is an obsession, you find yourself by reflectin
All by myself I am flexin', carving a lane for my section
I went away but still reppin', just had to change the direction
I'm jogging through the city, movin', screaming catch up if you can
Vest strapped, mask on getting this money in the sand
Damn Matthew, I'm the leader of this band brah
Best put up a hand brah, I pull up on demand brah
Back where I started, I'm gettin' used to the journey
You can assume what you want to, the input doesn't concern me
Handle the press like I'm Irving, might need a 30 for 30
Trying to be more consistent, Christmas might come around early
Worthy, and ready for it all, kicking shit that's off the wall
Guess it's Showtime Pettis, don't bank on my downfall
On point like Chris Paul, got it covered like Cliff Paul
Swizzzle that's a official but I do not miss a call, nah
Swizzzle that's a official but I do not miss a call, nah
Swizzzle I'm official you can kiss my fucking balls

What I wanna do and what I really think

Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably

I wanna show all the dirt I got running through my mind, whoa

I get 'em up! (I said I’m on one)
DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uhh, I’m getting so throwed
I ain't went this hard since I was 18
Apologize if I say, anything I don’t mean
Like ""what's up with your best friend?
We could all have some fun, believe me
And what's up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy?""
But get it while you here, boy
'Cause all that hype don’t feel the same next year, boy
Yeah and I’ll be right here in my spot
With a little more cash than I already got
Trippin' off you 'cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient
Me and 40 back to work but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumors, hate the bullshit
Hate these fucking allegations
I’m just feeling like the throne is for the taking
Watch me take it

[Chorus: Drake]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older, somebody shoulda told ya
I’m on one, yeah, fuck it I’m on one
Yeah, I said ""I’m on one"", fuck it I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I’m on one, I said ""Fuck it, I’m on one""

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I’m burning purple flowers, it’s burning my chest
I bury the most cash and burning the rest
Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air
Do ones beneath me recognize the red bottoms I wear?
Burner in the belt, move the kids to the hills (Boss)
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya ""everything is great""
Even though I'm out on bond and might be facing' 8
Still running with the same niggas 'til the death of me
Never seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams
In a room full of money out in London and she screams?
Baby, I could take ya there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
So yeah, we on one, the feeling ain’t fair (Khaled)
And it’s double M G until I get the chair

All I care about is money and the city that I'm from

I walk around the club, fuck everybody
And all my niggas got that Heat, I feel like Pat Riley
Yeah, too much money, ain't enough money
You know the feds listening, nigga what money?
I’m a maid nigga, I should dust something
You niggas on the bench, like the bus coming
Huh, ain't nothing sweet but the Swishers
I’m focused might as well say ""cheese"" for the pictures
Ohh, I’m about to go Andre the Giant
You a sell out, but I ain't buying
Chopper dissect a nigga like science
Put an end to your world like the Mayans
This a celebration bitches, Mazel tov

Grab hold of my instrument, get a grasp, and blow ""whee""

I'm thinkin' soon this tramp'll lean so we should bounce
But you're outta your tube-top
If you're thinkin' that mi casa es su casa
Yeah, you're a cute fox
Perfect ten so back that up like a moonwalk
Girl, you're smokin' like Snoop Dogg
But you must be tokin' if you think you're takin' over my quarters
There goes the dime into the jukebox
Two shots of blue Hpnotiq and soon I'll
Turn this pool hall to a barroom brawl
So, Rick, scratch on the break like the cue ball
Turn the volume all the way up on your boombox
And excuse the locker room talk, I'm just too raw
But apparently, so are you, ma
'Cause you just kicked me in the balls and told me to screw off
And that's why—

[Chorus: Eminem / Joan Jett & the Blackhearts]
I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (Yeah, me)
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (Yeah, me)

[Bridge: Eminem & Joan Jett & The Blackhearts]
Said ""Can I take you home, where we can be alone?""
Shorty, you the shit, girl, I ordered you to sit
I know you're probably feelin' me more than you admit
Pull up a chair, sweetie, let me order you a drink
I only go to meetings court-ordered from a shrink
So from the bottom to the top, floor to ceilin'
You ain't run of the mill, you're one in a million
'Cause real tits are still fun
But everybody knows fake tits are still better than real ones

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So come and spend the night with the guy most are terrified of
But tonight, curiosity overrides ya
Beside ya fired up like a starter pistol
Crystal, let's slide hon, tonight I'm your pilot
'Cause you should be up in the sky, girl
You're so fucking fly, you belong in the mile high club
So come on, baby, the night's young
Don't string me along, I'm high-strung
We might wind up on mound like we're tryin' for the Cy Young
Fuckin' 'fore we get to the house
Screwin' our brains out like changing a lightbulb
That's why I like ya, 'cause I'm crazy just like ya
Now every time I get brain, you screw mine up
I barely can think straight, your head game is a mindfuck
So ready, set, aim and fire
Yes, babe, I’m fallin' in like, that's kinda, why I love

[Chorus: Eminem / Joan Jett & the Blackhearts]
I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (Yeah me)

Skies are crying, I am watching
Catching tear drops in my hands
Only silence as it's ending
Like we never had a chance
Do you have to make me feel like there's nothing left of me?

[Chorus]
You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper

[Verse 2]
As the smoke clears
I awaken and untangle you from me
Would it make you feel better to watch me while I bleed?
All my windows still are broken, but I'm standing on my feet

[Chorus]
You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper

[Bridge]
Go run, run, run
I'm gonna stay right here
Watch you disappear
Yeah, oh
Go run, run, run
Yeah, it's a long way down
But I am closer to the clouds up here

You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am

Only live once, I'ma live mine up
Fill up the cup, lemme light my blunt
I don't really know what the fuck's in my cup
But a couple shots of it got a nigga on stuck
I'm just here to have a good time
A little white chick, a little white wine..
Out of town, spent a couple nights at TAOs
Smoking weed in the suite 'til we out of towels
And don't bother me, high as shit from my broccoli
Fly as shit for no goddamn reason
And y'all aiite - but y'all not like me
It's MMG and that's my clique
That's BOA, see that's my set
CDG shit match my kicks
An apostrophe I'm behind that S
Or the black Bimmer back to pick me up
Back wood, the tree I’m ashing out
See I be kicking my raps good, with or without sales
I'm killing these blackheads, my rap is Noxema
Light it up for a nigga
One or two hoes ain't enough for a nigga
One or two bottles ain't enough for a nigga
Red Berry everywhere, got Puff getting jealous

One night love: I'ma need that
He could own that, shawty, I'ma lease that
I'ma put you in the game where your cleats at
I'ma sign that work then release that
I don't be where the crabs or police at
I just be where the cash and the freaks at
Smoking Green Bay nigga, I'm a cheesehead
In a Lambo, see me where the G's at
$10K in my camos
Word. 10 Js and I can't move
Shades: LV was a little dough
I'm going hard for the days I was piss poor
And go hard 'cause I feel it's only right to
Maybach, G.O.O.D music: the right move
Girls say everything that I write smooth
Fuck rap, I'm getting pussy off a Haiku
One time for the girls with the right shoes
Fuckin' with a dude probably the right move
Two times for the chicks with the right bag
If it's right tonight, I might bite that
3 times, show me your peace sign
Not with your hand girl
Open your knees out!
Look, money what we 'bout
Stuntin' when we out
Double M-G - out!

Gotta keep at it, gotta stay focused

I’d rather stay friends with benefits 'til we ready

She like one more chance, more problems, no Biggie, ah
It’s all good, don’t take it the wrong way
Ain’t nothing personal, but who this nigga in your face?
We can leave together or give each other space
The night young, we should head over to my place
Ha, now we laughing and all that
Tell your friend they can fall back
Ain’t even gotta ask twice

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Ain't nobody like you
Heard you got a ballplayer
But he don't excite you
I ain't the one you gotta lie to
Lay down, relax, climax, let me bite you
Still a superfreak
You know how I be when I'm rolling in the streets
Enough about me, I heard you finished your degree
Just call me Ginuwine cause I'm the same Ol' G
We was young, full of insecurities
Grown up now, all we got is old memories
Used to be like enemies, arguing in Barney's, fly shit
Too much pride to say sorry
Shit, problems running like half the day
Number 24, let it fade away
She gotta leave but she wanna stay
She like ""how you feeling babe?""
Like, shit

[Hook]
I feel good
Got some time off, girl, it's been so long
Did you have fun?
Cause I'mma need a cab just to get me home
Maybe you could call in sick
Bring it to the crib and get all this
I know I'm blunt, but how real is that?
You want that feeling back?
Well you should know
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
And even though we let it go, it’s better that you know

190,Lost In Paradise,"[Verse 1]
What am I supposed to do with this heart?
How do I take it off if I love at all?
It's like a work of art
In love, we all will fall, but
We fell a little harder
What am I supposed to do with this heart?
It may be wrong, but it feels right
To be lost in paradise

[Chorus]
I'm so lost in paradise
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears, gone tonight
Let me stay
I'm lost in paradise

[Verse 2]
How was I to know that my love was delusional?
Somebody told me how to mend
A broken hearted soul

We fell a little harder
What am I supposed to do with this heart?
It may be wrong, but it feels right
To be lost in paradise

I'm so lost in paradise (Lost in paradise)

I hate purity
Hate goodness
I don't want virtue to exist anywhere
I want everyone corrupt

I am an architect
They call me a butcher
I am a pioneer
They call me primitive
I am purity
They call me perverted
Holding you but I only miss these things when they leave

[Pre-Chorus]
I am idiot drug hive
The virgin, the tattered and the torn
Life is for the cold made warm and they are just lizards
Self disgust is self-obsession honey and I do as I please
A morality obedient only to the cleansed repented

I am stronger than Mensa
Miller and Mailer, I spat out Plath and Pinter
I am all the things that you regret
A truth that washes that learnt how to spell

The first time you see yourself naked you cry
Soft skin now acne
Foul breath so broken
He loves me truly this mute solitude I'm draining
I know I believe in nothing but it is my nothing

[Pre-Chorus]
Sleep cannot hide thoughts splitting through my mind
Shadows aren't clean, false mirrors too many people awake
If you stand up like a nail then you will be knocked down
I've been too honest with myself I should have lied like everybody else

192,Barefoot Blue Jean Night,"[Verse 1]
A full moon shining bright
Edge of the water; we were feeling alright
Back down a country road
The girls are always hot, and the beer is ice cold
Cadillac, horns on the hood
My buddy Frankie had his dad hook him up good
Girls smile when we roll by
They hop in the back, and we cruise to the river side

[Chorus]
Never gonna grow up
Never gonna slow down
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show
We were doin' it right
We were comin' alive
Yeah, caught up in a Southern summer, a barefoot, blue jean night

[Verse 2]
Blue eyes and auburn hair
Sittin' lookin' pretty by the fire in a lawn chair
New to town, and new to me
Her ruby red lips was sippin' on sweet tea
Shot me in love like a shootin' star
So, I grabbed a beer and my ol' guitar
Then we sat around till the break of dawn
Howlin' and singin' our favorite song

[Chorus]
Never gonna grow up
Never gonna slow down
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show
We were doin' it right
We were comin' alive
Yeah, caught up in a Southern summer, a barefoot, blue jean night
Never gonna grow up

Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires

[Verse 1]
Back in the day Pott's farm was the place to go
Load the truck up, hit the dirt road
Jump the barbwire, spread the word
Light the bonfire, then call the girls
The king in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack 'n' Jim were a few good men
Where ya learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue
And all this small town he said, she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something y'all don't know
Man that talk is getting old
Ya better mind your business, man, watch your mouth
Before I have to knock that loud mouth out
I'm tired of talkin', man, y'all ain't listening
Them old dirt roads is what y'all missing

Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones

Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires

[Verse 2]
I sit back and think about them good ol' days
The way we were raised and our southern ways
And we like cornbread and biscuits
And if it's broke round here we fix it
I can take y'all where you need to go
Down to my hood, back in them woods
We do it different 'round here, that's right
But we sure do it good and we do it all night
See, if you really wanna know how it feels
To get off the road with trucks and four wheels
Jump on in, and man, tell your friends
We'll raise some hell where the blacktop ends

Chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones

When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones

But busy Iggy wouldn't even give 'em one more glance

Bite your lips, your words a robbery

I can't keep your voice out of my head
All I hear are the many echoes of
The darkest words you said
And it's driving me crazy
I can't find the best in all of this
But I'm always looking out for you
Cause you're the one I miss
And it's driving me crazy

Bite your lips, your words a robbery

206,Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall,"[Verse 1]
I turn the music up, I got my records on
I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
I feel my heart start beating to my favorite song
And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until Monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up, I'm on a roll this time
And heaven is in sight

[Verse 2]
I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble, sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop
Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart

As we saw, oh, this light
I swear you, emerge blinking into
To tell me it's alright

[Verse 1]
Slip it in her drink, and in the blink of an eye
I can make a white girl look chink
Don't know what to think, 'cause last time I attempted this shit
The judge ordered me to see a shrink
Started with the link
Contended her to meet me at the local Odd Future Wolf Gang skating rink
We was uniquely in sync
Already fuckin' and we only met last week
We were both young, not yet antique
So her mindset was working for my technique
Tell her that I love her and by next week
You can hear her shriek from the gashes in her cheeks
No, I'm not a freak, I am meekly a creep
The neighbors by the creek says my house stinks
And it reeks on the sheet, girl
Streaks of red, even though all pussy is pink
Oblivion makes obvious seeks
Which make meats for my obvious feasts
Used to just blot up thoughts, plot, and rethink
Now I get daughters and tie 'em and clink
Got my dick harder than iron and zinc
Now they just rot up, arms caught in the sink
Where they get cut up to fit my physique
Critique my chic in this brand new mink, go

[Chorus: Syd & Tyler, The Creator]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, ohh (Fish!)
Oh, oh

(All good?) Oh, oh (Cool)
(We cool?) Oh, ohh (I'm upset)

[Verse 2]
Bitches running 'round down, pussy take a trip
Make her strip, got my dick harder than the unzip
Tyler swiftly slips his dick inside of Taylor Swift's slit
Round trip in that pussy, here comes a ticket
Film clips popping on that Canon
Busting Ottoman cannons, on the pill
Is he real? Gaza stripping (In my living room)
Wolf Gang full moon, I'm assuming mushrooms (Mushrooms)
I'm a necrolampoon, not of Charles Mansoon
This fuck is ending soon because I'm ejaculating

Now I'd like to take this time of day
To thank the Mother Earth (Thank you Momma, thank you Momma, fish!)
Letting the sun shine down on the lake
While I fish your waters
Ooh, hide your daughters, hide your sisters
Hell, hide grandmama too (Grand, yeah)
'Cause the fisherman's raping everybody in the pool
He on the loose, yeah (Yeah)

[Outro]
Got to wash it down, all this gold is fuckin' bait
Wait 'til you see the semen swimming
Baby, please not half, the whole is great
Morals? Your body's near that coral reef
It was once upon a time you came home with me
Then the next chapter left you in my teeth
Fill your gills with goo
Going deeper than Pacific Ocean
This specific motion
Makes this hammerhead puke
Got to wear a wetsuit, can’t get seasick
I love when you're in fishnets, you want me to eat you
You’re fucking wet, fish

[Part 2: Boppin' Bitch]

[Chorus]
So I met this girl at the club
And I just wanted her to suck my dick
And that's 'cause

Now she's drunk and talkin' to me a lot
Until we go to another room
And that's 'cause
She a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin'

[Verse 1]
This little slut whore sucks cock for a little more bucks
Than them other sluts fuck for, real easy
Cause I didn't even knock on the front door, sleazy
I used the welcome mat as a cum rag
And all the Wolves fucked too, yeah she’s a cum bag
Filled with a bunch of shit I purchased at a drug store
Four more Dora-looking sluts let me explore
Until my cock got sore and started growing cold sores

[Chorus]
Now she thinks that I like her
But all I really wanted was that mouth
And that's 'cause
She a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch
Now she text messages me every day
And I don't ever hit that bitch back
And that's because
She a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch (That's right), she's a boppin' bitch, she's a boppin'

[Verse 2]
This little hoodrat started jockin' at my jock strap
Until my uncircumcised penis finally unwrapped
Flapping up and down until the cack finally go splat
Now you gotta spat, spit it out until you do scat
Then you gotta sat and shit it out, bitch, fuck your feelings
You wasn’t feeling shit when you was down there kneeling
Now shut the fuck up you got another dick to deal with

[Interlude]
Now, now why can't we fuck with this bitch? (She's boppin')
Wait, tell him why we can’t fuck with this bitch, y'all? (That bitch she boppin')
What is she? She a BB, what does that stand for? (She boppin')
She, what do she be doin'? (She boppin')

Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can’t reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening
I know the mark’s high, butter–
flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these
As pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because—

(It's the curse of the—, it's the curse of the—)
I walk on water (Shit)
But only when it freezes

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It's the curse of the standard, that the first of the Mathers disc set
Always in search of the verse that I haven’t spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect
I’ve garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin’ the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, ""This shit is garbage!""
God's given me all this, still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it’s exhaustive
And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, 'Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith
And I'm not Prince, so…

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Eminem]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
(It's true, I'm a Rubik's—, it's true—)
But only when it freezes
(It's true—)

[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé]
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's true, I'm a Rubik's—a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex–
pectations and meet 'em, but first
The ""Speedom"" verse, now Big Sean
He's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on
Me that matters now's DeShaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtain's drawn
They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares
Or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta site, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause—

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé]
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown

[Outro: Eminem]
'Cause I'm just a man
But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike

210,Far Away,"[Intro: Chris Richardson]
Walk a thousand miles
Just to see her (see her)

[Hook: Chris Richardson]
But she’s far, far away
And I’d do anything just to see her face
But she’s far, far away
Walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Sittin’ on a plane
Reminscing back when I made that mistake
I wish it never ended with a heartbreak
Now your heart broken, tears in ya face
Ask myself why, looking at the sky
If I could turn back I’d make it all right
Praying that you better but its still stormy weather
Don’t wanna let go but the rain won't let up
Now you gone, still thinking bout you everyday
And I know feelings was hurt and you can blame me but
I’m sorry for the games that I played
But now it’s too late
And now she’s…

[Hook: Chris Richardson]
But she’s far, far away
And I’d do anything just to see her face
But she’s far, far away
Walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again

[Verse 2: Tyga]
It’s cold putting up a fight
Arguing back and forth through the night
Regardless what I said I don’t mean most of it
You know I really love you, this the realest goin’ get
It take time to realize what you really wanna know
You was ready for it all but your feelings I ignored
I know my fault, I should’ve gave more
Now you’re miles away and I’m miles on tour
Now it’s drums playing, crowd singing
Life changing, wish you was here to witness all
Now that starts fading
They say two wrongs don’t make it right
And I was wrong and now it ain't right

[Hook: Chris Richardson]
But she’s far, far away
And I’d do anything just to see her face
But she’s far, far away
Walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again

[Bridge: Tyga + Chris Richardson]
Na na na nah
If I could turn back
If I could make it right
I’d do just that
If I could make it right
I’d do it all tonight
Hold you in my arms, with you I’d spend my life

If I could turn back
If I could make it right
I’d do just that
I’d do just that
If I could turn back
(Come back here again)

And I’d do anything just to see her face
But she’s far, far away
Walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again

211,Knee Deep,"[Verse 1]
Going to put the the world away for a minute
Pretend I don't live in it
Sunshine going to wash my blues away
Had sweet love but I lost it
She got too close so I fought her
Now I'm lost in the world trying to find me a better way

[Chorus]
Wishing I was knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze and it don't seem fair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

[Verse 2: Jimmy Buffett]
Wrote a note said be back in a minute
Bought a boat and I sailed off in it
Don't think anybody going to miss me anyway
Mind on a permanent vacation
The ocean is my only medication
Wishing my condition ain't ever going to go away

[Chorus]
Now I'm knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

[Bridge]
This champagne shore washing over me
It's a sweet sweet life living by the salty sea
One day you could be as lost as me
Change your geography
Maybe you might be

[Chorus]
Knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

It's not unusual to have fun with anyone
But when I see you hanging about with anyone
It's not unusual to see me cry
Oh I wanna' die

It's not unusual to go out at any time
But when I see you out and about it's such a crime
If you should ever want to be loved by anyone
It's not unusual it happens every day
No matter what you say

You find it happens all the time
Love will never do, what you want it to
Why can't this crazy love be mine?

[Saxophone]

It's not unusual, to be mad with anyone

217,Love Done Gone,"[Verse 1]
Don't worry, baby, sometimes things change
Nothing we can do about it now, no way
This doesn't come easy, but that's just life
We can't keep pretending everything's alright
We told each other it was love before
The simple truth is it just ain't no more
The bells stop ringing, the music won't play
The crazy little feeling that's faded away
Like snowflakes when the weather warms up
Like leaves on the trees when the autumn comes
Like the dogwood blossoms in a late spring rain
All the disappearing bubbles in a glass of champagne
Like a red kite lost in a blue sky wind
I don't know where the good times end when

[Chorus]
It ain't nothing we ever said or ever did wrong
It's just love done gone

[Verse 2]
I don't regret a single thing that we did
Anytime together, we ever spent
I wouldn't change a thing, baby, you know
Sometimes we got to just go with the flow
Like snowflakes when the weather warms up
Like leaves on the trees when the autumn comes
Like the dogwood blossoms in a late spring rain
All the disappearing bubbles in a glass of champagne

Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag
Yeah, I put it down like my hands hurting
I'm on a natural high, but I land perfect
Some of us are lovers, most of y'all haters
But I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper
So love or hate me, I stay hate-free
They say we learn from mistakes; why, that's why they mistake me
I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers
All hail Weezy, call it bad weather
I stick to the script, I memorize the lines
Cause life is a movie that I've seen too many times

Times have changed, but fuck it get a new watch
I still got the vision like a line between two dots
Young Money's eating, the label getting fatter
And yea, the tables turned, but I'm still sitting at 'em
I'm a bad motherfucker cause the good die young
Everybody selling dreams, I'm too cheap to buy one
Man, when that cookie crumble, everybody want a crumb
Shoot that hummingbird down, hummingbird don't hum

Of what once was a happy home

Could this be that it was all a lie
And we're just afraid to say good-bye

Am I the only one
Who sees what we've become
I see no sense in going on
Or asking what went wrong
We sit and stare at what could be
We both just grew apart you see
And through no fault of our own
It's our house but not a home
It's strange to know
There's truth in what I say
Baby, I know you feel the same
And the truth is
No one's to blame
Two lonely dreamers
Playing by the rules
All we thought of
Was me and you
Now we're faced
With a simple truth
I'd love to say that this is all a lie
But that just means I'm scared to say good-bye

Fuck beefing with babies
Catch a man raving
We're taking your paper, your 'yac and your ladies
Fistfight, this bitch bites like it's rabies
Drop from your baby, catch him there

Bumped into Dave by the Santander
You was in the same spot you was in last year
You said, ""Life ain't fair""
I know man who live life in fear
This time last year
You were on the same block, standing there
Smoking, gossiping, chatting bare
Don't tell me that you ain't involved
Them Jme 'cause a man don't care
Man don't business, love no witness
Hug no traitor, spud no snitches
Man try live this, never knew he had a clitoris
Have man for breakfast, talk about hit list
I bring the fire, you a liar and a backstabber
I'm with the born-chasers or I'm with the cash grabbers
I'm doing mathematics, automatic, never static
And she don't know my real name, she thought I was Patrick
Sit back and smoke a baseball bat
You think this is the life but it ain't all that
I've done some evil things that I wouldn't take back
I keep it to myself 'cause people wanna chat
Keep it to yourself, people wanna talk
Flossing in the gossip's how you end up in a war
I got nothing for a fed, copper for your head
And that's the definition of a penny for your thoughts
We just live and maintain
We on the same streets but we don't play the same game
You're the type to get caught and go and play the blame game
You should be ashamed
If I stick to my heart, I put my stick to your brain
Let it rip for the pain, they put shit on my name, 'til I grip and I aim
Dip on a plane with a brand new name
Mummy, I got a flight to catch
All for an internet gangster or a cyber-man
Mike Myers man, a couple tries tried to try a man
My boys put stars in the hood like I'm Stryder, man
I know people wearing Rollies doing life in can
Isn't it ironic that they couldn't find the time to plan?
Still keep a faith in God, still couldn't spare the rod
Marcel, you know me, I came with the blazing squad
You better pray to God whenever I'm in town
Like a kid in a divorce, I'm leaving with your spouse
I can't make a horse or the river open its mouth
You ain't got the drive, that's why you're in a drought
Life's great, I'm in Sweden or Copenhagen
Getting brain from a Dane whose first name I can't pronounce

[Chorus: J Hus]
Smiling like a nice person
Came on a Rambo ting, everyting camouflaging
Looking like a bulletproof vest, nah, that's just a body warmer
Big man gossiping, there's noting worser
I swear I'm a father for them man
Bring something larger for them man
Disaster, disaster for them man
Them man, them man, them man there
Make a one trip there, just to make a one ting clear
Then fly out to Edinburgh
I'm so fly, I might just pop my collar
Need a zoobie to roll
Left eye look through your soul
I'm blinded by love while I'm winking at you
I'm thinking out loud so you know I'm always thinking 'bout you
Same time, I don't think I'm too irrational",Dave,2011,[87],1
232,I Love You This Big,"[Verse 1]
I know I'm still young
But, I know how I feel
I might not have too much experience
But, I know when love is real
By the way my heart starts pounding
When I look into your eyes
I might look a little silly
Standing with my arms stretched open wide

[Chorus]
I love you this big
Eyes have never seen this big
No-one's ever dreamed this big
And I'll spend the rest of my life
Explaining what words cannot describe but, I'll try
I love you this big

[Verse 2]
I'll love you to the moon and back
I'll love you all the time
Deeper than the ocean
And higher than the pines
Because girl, you do something to me
Deep down in my heart
I know I look a little crazy
Standing with my arms stretched all apart

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
So much bigger than I ever dreamed my heart ever would
I love you this big
And I'd write your name in stars across the sky
If I could, I would

Baby, I'm coming for you

[Verse 4]
Then there's Jim
I almost forgot I ran him off
But I took the yacht
Poor ol' Billy

I'm hell on heels
Say what you will
I done made the devil a deal

And I finally asked you to dance on the last slow song
Beneath that moon that was really a disco ball
I can still feel my head on your shoulder
And hoping that song would never be over

I haven't seen you in ages
Sometimes I find myself
Wondering where you are
For me, you'll always be 18
And beautiful, and dancin' away with my heart

I brushed your curls back so I could see your eyes
And the way you moved me was like you were reading my mind
I can still feel you lean in to kiss me
I can't help but wonder if you ever miss me

I haven't seen you in ages
Sometimes I find myself
Wondering where you are
For me, you'll always be 18
And beautiful, and dancin' away with my heart

You headed off to college
At the end of that summer and we lost touch
I guess I didn't realize even at that moment we lost so much

For me, you'll always be 18

I’m real as they come, I follow the rules
I’m still in the hood but I probably should move
Made enough money, I don’t fuck around
I just felt they needed me so I stuck around
Feds got my man, shit is real son
Cause my godson just became my real son
Think life is a game but all you get is a turn
You live and you learn, either you freeze or you burn
Kush in the air, I’m pushing the gears
Love turned into hate, hate turned into fear
If it ain't right, I don’t sign the deal
Shoot me in the watch, I got time to kill
Gasoline, propane
Ain't no salary cap in the dope game
Ain't no collective bargaining on cocaine

She owes me everything and she knows it
I've seen all the scenes in this movie, and she blows it at the end
She keeps talking to me, cause she knows that I'm a friend
But I can't keep hearing it over and over again
I was the one that you came to
When you broke up with your boyfriend, man, fuck him
Girl I was the one, that told you fuck them other niggas
And you still went and fucked them other niggas
Most people learn from the bad things
I hope that you learn and don't crash and burn in the fast lane
But if you read this letter then you caught me
This should explain all the ways that you taught me

[Hook: T-Pain]
How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring, moving on to better things

And I don't love them hoes
But don't fuck up with Wayne cause when it ""Waynes"" it pours
No really, I'm on my ""fuck that bitch"" shit
You used to be the shit, but now you ain't shit, bitch
I had a red bone, but she be tripping though
All that bullshit is for the birds, she was pigeon toed
She used to always say, fuck my niggas
And when I went to jail, she fucked my niggas
Well, I guess I'm single for the night
And you can sit right on my middle finger for the night
And if I sound mad, then you caught me
But this shit explains that you're the one that taught me

And I heard you're doing you, and you heard I'm doing better
And all I had to do was put two and two together
But that just makes four, but not forever, damn

I try to slow down, and I get rear-ended

Nothing standing in my way like nothing's my security
Back to my journey, that bullshit don't concern me
If I knew I was going to jail, I would have fucked my attorney
If you sleeping on me, nigga, then I hope you toss and turnin'
I'm so cold I'm hypothermic, ask your bitch, she will confirm it, yeah
Now what we doin' with it?
Keep opening your grill, I'm barbecuin' with it
I know my shit already tight so I ain't screwin' with it
Some say this game is a joke, well I hope they get it
Okay, I'm walking on needles, sticking to the point
Yeah, the streets is talking, I'm familiar with the voice
I'm a gangsta by choice, I hope my sons choose wiser
And don't call me ""Sir,"" call me ""Survivor""

Uh, yeah
Uh, haha
And they go ""yep, yep""
Yep, yep

Uh, call me ""Killer"" 'cause I make a killin'
I got this shit wrapped up, bow and a ribbon
That's them twin Glocks, you can call them siblings
And them bullets travel, better hope I keep dribblin'
I touch the sky, get the clouds out my fingernails
These bitches think they fly like Tinkerbell
But they all on my wire like Stringer Bell
I let them be, 'cause you know how the sting’ll feel
Know how to whip that white girl, I can spank her tail
And I fuck up any track: train derail
Know how to roll, never need training wheels
And when the truth hurts, I pop pain pills
Uh, all or nothing or nothing else
I bleed reality, I should cut myself
Just had a bowl of riches, and a cup of wealth
And the ""F"" is for ""Fuck yourself""

[Outro]
Uhh, yeah
And I ain’t doing nothing but getting my share, breathin' this air
And Mack moms told me she gon' keep me in her prayers
So I’m feeling alright, I’m tryna stay aware
And if you wanna trip, then I'ma meet you there
To my niggas in the game, keep the game fair
Players play, coaches coach, and cheerleaders cheer
I’m trying to keep spirit when the ghost disappear

Shit, I'm much more than a good speech

Gorillas in suits
The holy war, the spiritual troops
Fighting over the mythical truth

My name Mac Miller, who the fuck are you
Well my crew too live but I ain’t Uncle Luke
And I ain’t no hipster, but girl I can make your hips stir
From Pittsburgh, smoke papers or a swisher
Welcome to the Cam Rellim chronicles
Looking out my monocle
I’m dodging obstacles, I gamble like the Bellagio
You cock-a-roach, I’m heroin cause everything I talk is dope
Type to leave it clean and fucking shiny word to Mop & Glo
Tryin’ to get a mansion ain’t nobody here gon' find my room
Money gonna be green I guarantee you that my slide stay blue
So press play, I start from scratch and never use no template
The next day these losers always goin’ with whats trendy
My pen game is something these motherfuckers have never seen
All City Champion everybody is second string
No need to testify (testify) for the best is I (best is I)
And anybody in my way goin’ to be left to die

[Hook]
I'ma feed the world you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don’t plan on looking back
Anything you need you can find it at the market
If you don’t hold me down, for all I care, you can starve bitch
I'ma feed the world you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don’t plan on looking back
Anything you need you can find it at the market
Anything you need you can find it at the market

[Verse 2]
I got my own stickers now so literally I’m everywhere
Hundred different shoes still feel the need to cop a fresher pair
These motherfuckers treat me like it’s just my second year
Fool you better get prepared
Don’t know ‘bout you but all my rhymes is deadly here
Frick Park Market where we kicking out the garbage
Sick bars I’ve been a boss so stick around and watch it
Didn't fit around no college campus, chilling writing on top of planet Earth
Fuck who's first, It’s just bout who the hardest
On my own two, fuck who's saying different
Every time I rhyme I get that Punxsutawney feeling
I’m the starter you the fill in
You a martyr I’m just killing
Getting harder with each time I write
Wish I could rewind last night
I had so much fun just kickin’ it and goin’ in
Don’t call me Malcolm if you didn’t fuckin’ know me then
And if you lonely girl I could be your only friend
You got some shit to say I suggest you hold it in, bitch

[Hook]
I'ma feed the world you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don’t plan on looking back
Anything you need you can find it at the market
If you don’t hold me down, for all I care, you can starve bitch
I'ma feed the world you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don’t plan on looking back

I got a feeling we are gonna win
Our bodies make it perfect
And your eyes can make me swim
Then again, everything seems new
I can barely hold my tongue

And your eyes
Are saying more than we can talk
And warmer than our bedroom sport
And your thighs

Is that your knee resting on mine?
Can you feel that?
If I move, I can

When I press an ear up to your breast
I can hear the rhythm start
It's hard to tell our beats apart
So I hope you're listening right now
'Cause I can barely hold my tongue
The shit we do could warm the sun
At night
Twisted in a melting fall and sleeping with the scratching claws
And your words
Let me know you're feeling me and seeing all the things I see

And the the beast within
He learns to swim
And so I cannot win
Drink up, drink in

These things have come to pass

The trees have grown from seeds

To bend, not break
So bend me back again
Again, and then

The life will come to pass

I dared to heal and soon
I soon forgot to feel
The lights were on
But everything was gone
The beast he screams
He begs upon his knees
For me to run

I run into his arms
And I have come to pass

[Verse 4]
I had to let him out
Just once it was enough
To take the doubt
And turn it into truth
The beast was free
So guilty I will plea

His hands among the stars
Each one will come to pass

The damage caused was great
My love has turned to hate
I beg for death
But sleep will never come
I curse the sun

Girl, I got a Chevy with hydraulics and you reminding me of it
Up and down, up and down, girl you know what's happening

And you got them embarrassed by what you got from your parents
I'm trying to see them shorts, spread apart
I ain't coming up short, Kevin Hart

Can't get it off my mind
I need to get out of sight

What started out as a simple altercation
Turned into a real sticky situation

Whatchu expect me to do if you're playing me for a fool?
I will lose my cool and reach for my firearm

But it's too late to turn back now
Don't know what I was thinking
Now he's no longer living
So I'm 'bout to leave town, aye-uh

Told the one I love, ""I’ll be back one day""
Through the fight, through the pain, booked a flight, took a plane
Told her not to cry, I’ll be back one day
Been dreaming this since I was young

And yes I am the best man, I’m so sorry 'bout the mix-up

Blood gang kill 'em all, Odd Future Wolf Gang
Kidnap a vampire, drain all his fuckin veins
Wolf Grey Jordans, use his intestines for the strings
Snatch up Rihanna and throw her in front of a fuckin' train
Sniff a fucking unemployment line of cocaine
Tie Lil B up to a full tank of propane
Swag, now watch him cook...and just stand there and look
Have a bonfire with old Harry Potter books
Martians vs. Goblins, goons vs. the crooks
And since me and Tune had Viacom shook
I shoulda got a real-ass pirate to do the hook
Maybe Jack Sparrow maybe Peter Pan's nemesis
My power's limitless like Blanka on Sega Genesis
Superhero, mad that Marvel overlooked me
Cause Spiderman and Hulk straight pussy

Wolf Gang, we rock, crack rock and that shit was expected
Like Jayceon whenever he name-drop (Fuck you, Tyler)

My team is running shit like we have full-cleat Adidas

I fucked her on the day of that naked video shoot
I was sucking that pussy like it was wonton soup
Then I hit Lebron's mom in bron-bron's coupe
With Delonte West taping, we had bon-bons too
With Cleveland cheerleaders, they had pom-poms too
So I smacked them bitches wearing Bishop Don Juan's suit
(Where was Snoop?) I don't know, probably doing what the Crips do
But when I'm with my uncle, fuck it! Then I'm a Crip too

I think that you deserve some form of apology
So here I am, and here it is. I'm sorry

You were the balloon that drifted from the flock into my window
But you slipped right through my fingers that grew too tiresome to hold you
I watched you float away, watched as it turned into desperate longing
This time not for some drastic change, but for the string that was made to be held by me

I think that you deserve some form of apology
So here I am, once again, I'm sorry

I don't even want you back
No, I would never want to risk something like that
Cause I lost faith in myself
When I turned away from the one with the longest stretch of embracing arms to hold me

We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me

263,Don't Hold Your Breath,"[Intro]
Don't hold your breath

[Chorus]
You can't touch me now
There's no feeling left
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath
What you did to me, boy, I can't forget
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath

[Verse 1]
I was under your spell for such a long time
Couldn't break the chains
You played with my heart, tore me apart
With all your lies and games
It took all the strength I had
But I crawled up on my feet again
Now you're trying to lure me back
But no, those days are gone my friend
I loved you so much
That I thought someday that you could change
But all you brought me was a heart full of pain

[Chorus]
You can't touch me now
There's no feeling left
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath
What you did to me, boy, I can't forget
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath

[Post-Chorus]
Don't hold your breath

[Verse 2]
I was worried about you
But you never cared about me none
You took my money and I know that you
You could kill someone
I gave you everything
But nothing was ever enough
You were always jealous over such crazy stuff

[Chorus]
You can't touch me now
There's no feeling left
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath
What you did to me, boy, I can't forget
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath

[Post-Chorus]
Don't hold your breath

[Bridge]
Move on (move on), don't look back (don't look back)
I jumped off the train running off the tracks
Your day's gone (your day's gone), face the facts (face the facts)
A bad movie ends and the screen fades to black

[Break]
What you did to me, boy, I can't forget
If you think I'm coming back
(You can't touch me now)

[Chorus]
You can't touch me now
There's no feeling left
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath (don't hold your breath, no)
What you did to me, boy, I can't forget
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath
You can't touch me now
There's no feeling left
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath
What you did to me, boy, I can't forget
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath",Nicole Scherzinger,2011,[86],1

Plus I’m struggling tryna find the keys to my car

Wish you was in my position, you too broke to play the part

With me in the back, sippin' Rosé with some hash twistin’
All about a dollar, my team into cash gettin’
Straight outta the 'Burgh where we drink and we smash niggas

Good morn' or evening, friends
Smile, you recordin'?

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Slammin' Bentley doors like we invented doors
20 years ago we drove Bentley Azures
We drinkin' Cristal then
Yeah, kept the tray on me like Chris Paul then
Drinkin' Ace of Spades like it's codeine now
Tryna put a million on the whole team now
Push through the pain so we can see new life
So all the ladies havin' babies, see ya sacrifice
Mama had four kids, but she's a lesbian
Had to pretend so long that she's a thespian
Had to hide in the closet, so she medicate
Society shame and the pain was too much to take
Cried tears of joy when you fell in love
Don't matter to me if it's a him or her
I just wanna see you smile through all the hate
Marie Antoinette, baby, let 'em eat cake

[Chorus: JAY-Z & Stevie Wonder]
Bad times turn to good memories, smile
Even when I'm gone and you remember me, smile
Good times never fade away, smile
Even if I'm not with you here today, smile
Good morn' or evening, friends
Smile
Here's your friendly announcer

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Far as draft picks, my name did not get called
Bet before I go I put a billion on the board
Hall of Fame Hov, I did it all without a pen
Y'all knew that was comin', I had to remind y'all again, huh?
Flyin' paper planes through the projects
Now the whole projects on my jet
Now you see the real in the front row
In every one of y'all televised shows
Super facts
Niggas switched sides, traded pride, we don't do all that
A loss ain't a loss, it's a lesson
Appreciate the pain, it’s a blessin'

[Chorus: JAY-Z & Stevie Wonder]
Bad times turn to good memories, smile
Even when I'm gone and you remember me, smile
Good times never fade away, smile
Even if I'm not with you here today, smile
Good morn' or evening, friends

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
I mastered my aesthetics
I know you often heard me wax poetic
'Bout bein' back in the Lexus
But trust me, that was nothin', a nigga up in
The hundreds of millions, I have no ceilings
Ah, this that feelin', I'm that boy
Anita Baker's ""You Bring Me Joy"" slappin' out of the toy
The separation is clear in my rear-view mirror
Objects is further than they appear
Oh yeah, I was born with a pair, playin' for high stakes
Norman's Cay, he looked up and out of the Lear
How niggas can't relate?
Fuck a slice of the apple pie, want my own cake
In charge of my own fate, respect Jimmy Iovine
But he gotta respect the Elohim as a whole new regime
And niggas playin' for power, huh
So our music is ours, niggas own their own houses
Ours was, ""Fuck you, pay me""
Now it's, ""Fuck payin' me, I pay you
Put the rest away for Blue""
That blood money I giggle at it
Can't even support my miss' habit
Jewelry shoppin' in Pa- all ya jewelers should be embarrassed
Huh, blood diamonds drippin' with guilt, I still ain't trippin'
That's life, winners and losers
Drug dealers and abusers, America likes me ruthless
My therapist said I relapsed
I said, ""Pre-haps I Freudian slipped in European whips""
God sent me to break the chain, I'm the true and livin'
God in the flesh, the rest of these niggas is vain
A stain on the white suit, inferior IQ
Niggas'll rip your shit off TIDAL just to spite you
Ahhhh, what did I do? 'Cept try to free you
Niggas'll love you but hate you 'cause they can't be you
Dump 'em all in the bayou, uh
Everybody wave bye to the guy you thought you could lie to
This was meant to be a haiku, huh
But my story's too wide to fit inside the line or two
Oh, these that drugs, heron flow, I spaz on the stove
This is Hov, no flex zone, nigga, who lied to you?
Look, you a pedestrian, don't ever question the security I provided you
Oh y'all thought I was washed? I'm at the cleaners
Launderin' dirty money like the Teamsters, huh
Shout out to Hoffa back home, he in the church
When I heard you got booked, that shit hurt
Feel for you bro, we know the system don't work
Take a young nigga freedom over some dirt
Yet it's legal in Colorado, yet, we deny
Black entrepreneurs, free enterprise
That's why it's a black market, that's why it's called the trap
That's why it's called the projects 'cause it's exactly that
All these people was gon' kill me, heh
'Cause the more I reveal me, the more they 'fraid of the real me
Welcome back Carter, smile

[Outro: Gloria Carter]
Living in the shadow
Can you imagine what kind of life it is to live?
In the shadows people see you as happy and free
Because that's what you want them to see
Living two lives, happy, but not free
You live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or the person you love
The world is changing and they say it's time to be free
But you live with the fear of just being me
Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be
No harm for them, no harm for me
But life is short, and it's time to be free
Love who you love, because life isn't guaranteed

267,Old Alabama,"[Verse 1]
She’d rather wear a pair of cutoff jeans
Than a fancy evening dress
And with her windows rolled down and her hair all blown around, she’s a hot southern mess
She’ll take a beer over white wine
And a campfire over candle light
And when it comes to love, oh her idea of a romantic night

[Chorus]
Is listening to old Alabama, driving through Tennessee
A little Dixieland Delight at the Right Time of the Night
And she can’t keep her hands off of me-ee-Eee!

[Verse 2]
And now we’re rolling down an old back road
I got the steering wheel in one hand
We’ll find a hideaway where she and I can play
In Mother Nature’s band

[Chorus]
Now we’re listening to old Alabama
Parked somewhere in Tennessee
A little Dixieland Delight and It Feels So Right
And It’s Love In The First Degree-ee-Eee!

[Verse 3]
Forget about Sinatra or Coltrane
Or some old Righteous Brothers song
And Barry White is not going to work tonight
If you really want to turn her on
Play some back home come on music
That comes from the heart
Play something with lots of feeling
Because that’s where music has to start

[Chorus]
Now we’re listening to Old Alabama
And we’re driving through Tennessee
A little Dixieland Delight and It Feels So Right
And its Love in the First Degree

Yeah’ you know we’re listening to Old Alabama (old Alabama) driving through Tennessee (Tennessee)

Oh and she can’t keep her hands off of me-ee-Eee

Put my kicks up on they desk
Unaffected by they threats
Then get busy on they ass
See, that's how that Chi-Town made me
That's how my daddy raised me

One in the air for the people ain't here
Two in the air for the father that's there
Three in the air for the kids in the ghetto
Four for the kids that don't wanna be there
None for the niggas tryna hold them back
Five in the air for the teachers not scared
To tell those kids that's livin' in the ghetto
That the niggas holdin' back, that the world is theirs
Yeah, yeah, the world is yours, I was once that little boy
Terrified of the world, now I'm on a world tour
I would give up everything, even start a world war
For these ghetto girls and boys
I'm rappin' round the world for
Africa to New York, Haiti, then I detour
Oakland out to Auckland, Gaza Strip to Detroit
Say hip-hop only destroy, tell 'em look at me, boy
I hope your son don't have a gun and never be a d-boy

No matter what you into
No matter what you see when you look outside your window

274,We Don't Get Down Like Y'all,"We don’t get down like y'all
We don’t get down like y'all
Sucka nigga, we don’t get down like y'all

It’s been a lot of back and forth over this and that
Listen, pimpin’, let me tell you what the business is
Y’all and us I’mma tell you what the difference is
See, we old school, you just old news
We used to move blow, and you just blow dude
See we the talk of the town, me and my whole crew
You run around town, gossip like the hoes do
See you name-drop when nobody knows you
We get them lames out our section like we 'posed to
My crew, we cop the Bentley Brookland and the Roll too
You give her roses I’m the one she bring the rose to
So you say you’re shining, well I guess I’m shining more
So high up, I’m soaring, thirty and I’m like a dinosaur
Me to you like a comparing a vet to a cadet, nigga
Don’t call it a comeback
Again ride Benz from the fed pen
Pull up on them suckers, pop the trunk and tell ‘em get in
Thought I lost a step well guess again
I show you how to make a blessing out of bad breaks
Hoes want their clothes back, listen up fagbait
Them hot pants bad for your prostate
Lime green, hot pink, a drag queen hot date
At stores asking for the same size the bitches buy
They say it's hip, but where I'm from we call it sissyfied
Before us there were none, after us no more there'll ever be
This the greatest show on Earth you ever see
I still do it for my niggas in the streets, getting to it
Blowing money like my nigga, Big Meech used to do it
Say we’re blowing money fast, big old money bag
Three, four hundred cash just to make them suckers madBeen the best since I was rapping in the rattle,
As you comment on the rumors or what have you
Beware dude, prayer can’t prepare you, how dare you?
Disrespect my presence peasants, I will tear you
A new one, I poop on, your egos and move on
Rolls Royce back seat, no Grey Poupon
A true don, three piece cashmere suit on
Hear the truth on every song I spew on, Bloaw",T.I.,2011,[78],1

Ain't nothing usual 'bout me, uh
I put that on whoever doubt me
I'm going manic, she calling me 'Fousey'
But nothing delusional 'bout me (Facts!)
Sometimes, I talk 'bout my music
They tell me that I need to cool it around me (For real)
But look at my numbers, then look at your numbers
Like, why you refusin' to count me? (H-oh shit!)
I'm like one, two three, four, five
She never wanted to pick up on my line (Huh?)
I was too awkward, I acted like Einstein
Tryin' to put together the pieces in my mind (Yeah)
Too many hours on internet, faking my intellect, in my bed
Making a universe with my time, huh
I'm livin' life auto-pilot, 'cause I'm so fly, and I'm not even tryin' (Huh?)
Ain't nothin' changed but the cosmetics
Defense mechanism make 'em all jealous
If they ain't gonna listen to me, huh (Who?)
Guess they gonna listen to the Margielas (Huh?)
I hope that when they listen, make it all better
But that's a big ask, in some tall letters
When I'm needin' them most, I know they gon' either go ghost
And then switch up on they colors, like the fall weather ([?])
Okay, back-back-back-back-back
See me in the back of the class, when I rap (Facts!)
You be on the Snapchat-chat-chat
No filter, like the water on the tap-tap-tap, huh

Tryna' get my aiming back
Sorry that you came in last, yeah (Hold up)

I am not Kim, but I did the impossible
Drop me the addy, that's where I'mma hit (Huh?)
I got the sticks, I'm sendin' up blizzards
Just like a blender, leave your ass mixed ([?])
Ain't nothing usual, Designer my fit (Slatt!)
I keep a .40, Glock, counter (Slatt!) full kick (Bop!)
B. Lou a diamond, was formed under pressure
(Brrr...ah!) Feel like olympic, I'm winning a medal ([?], slatt!)
Want me to fall, but a nigga won't let up
Everything usual, hunnids my paper (B. Lou)
You got the check, 'cause you gotta pay me (Check)
Run up the digits, add up (Add up) the money (Oh!)
Bitches wanna love me, kick it like rugby (Huh?)
I got the hunnids, count 'em in public (B. Lou!)

Thinking how you died, but you said I could be shit
Now I'm on my grind baby look at me now, look at me now, yeah

Gotta watch for the 12 I got drugs on me

I remember that time we were sippin' on wine
I could see it in your eyes, you were feeling alive
Why'd I tell you I was good, why the fuck would I lie

Thinking how you died, but you said I could be shit

278,Homeboy,"[2Pac]
Oh shit, caught that nigga alone. Ain't that a bitch?
Hey, uh, this one here is, uhh for them niggas that be Johnny Dangerous when they be fuckin' 50 deep
But they be fuckin' cowards when they by theyselves
You know who I'm talkin' about
You know who I'm talkin' about, that's right
You ain't shit without your homeboys
You ain't shit without your homeboys
You ain't shit without your homeboys

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now, everytime I see you cats is rollin' in packs
For the life of me I cannot see why you don't know how to act
Love to clown when you deep, but when you on that solo creep out on the streets you don't hear a peep
Nigga, it's a God damn shame, somebody explain
Why they sent a Bad Boy to play a grown man's game?
Tear that ass out the frame, completely get that ass kicked
Woke up on the street, but you'll be sleepin' in the casket
How long will it last? Nigga, don't ask, just be first to blast
Outlaw on the mash, tryin' to be the first to see some cash
My shit's classic, like my nigga Nate
Go get the tape, we keep the nation anticipatin' until we break
Money made me evil, court cases got me stressed
Niggas aimin' at my head, but I still wear my vest
I don't give a fuck, motherfuckers, I'm loc
They all duckin' when my gun smoke
You ain't shit without your homeboys

[Hook: 2Pac]
You probably run at the sound of funk
I give a fuck, you niggas is punks
Without your homeboys you be the first to reach in your trunk
You scary niggas is punks
You ain't shit without your homeboys, nigga
(Punk ass.. that's right motherfucker)
You ain't shit without your homeboys
(Throw your hands up you little trick)
(a squared.. coward motherfucker)

[Verse 2: Young Noble]
Like Yak said, how the fuck you gonna shoot me rocks?
When you got the Outlaw Pac shittin' your box
You was lookin' real weak walkin' down the street
Now a nigga 30 deep, oh, you wanna beef?
Talk cheap, shoot a nigga the fair one
Your homies like fuck it – what's this? You the only scared one
Damn, son, close call I bet
Now down around the way you gets no respect
They like that Outlaw nigga played you out
We could have took it to the fists, I would have laid you out
Niggas be actin' all different when they dogs come around
Watch 'em act like bitches when Outlawz draw down
They all clown, better yet they all stunned
You the type to have a gun and never blazed it once
Get y'all banana split, you ain't Emmanuel
Outlawz you'll never forget, Makaveli the Don get a call y'all
Turnin these streets into Vietnam
Where your homeboys?

[Hook: 2Pac]
You ain't shit without your homeboys
My thug niggas, I love niggas
From small time crooks to big-time drug dealers (without your homboys)
The only thing a nigga got left
I love my niggas to death, we ain't shit without our homeboys
(You know what time it is)
I ain't shit without my homeboys
(Hey, tell 'em the story how you came up, nigga)

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Now, I was born alone, took my first joint and I got high alone
Now I'm an Outlaw nigga, I never die alone
Me and my niggas is so close, it's complicated
One nigga smokin' and drinkin', and yet we all faded
My nigga Edi had a son, we all happy
Cause now that little ridah got to deal with eight daddies
My niggas cry, we all cry, and all ride
To rectify the problem, motherfuckers, they all die
Been tryin' to make a million by hustlin since my adolescence
From crack dealin' to rap villian, my new profession
Who wanna see me at eight deep, fuck 3D
You coward ass motherfuckers'll never see me
Bustin' with automatic straps, my raw raps like good crack
Niggas fiendin', I got 'em comin' back. Until I die, they label me as a ridah forever, my niggas be together

[Outro/Hook]
Ain't shit without your homeboys
Thug niggas, I love niggas
From small time crooks to big-time drug dealers
Without your homeboys
The only thing a nigga got left

[Verse 1: Big Sean & Ariana Grande]
Okay, this, this, this for my number one girl who got the top spot title
Spent a hour in the bathroom, walked out looking like a model
God, doing what you do, got me right there with Apollo on the moon
Who needs genies in a bottle, girl, if they already got you?
Boy, you make me feel so lucky
Finally the stars align
Never has it been so easy to be in love
And to give you this heart of mine

[Pre-Chorus 1: Ariana Grande]
You know what I need
I know what you like

Now, if all fell through, would you catch me before the pavement?
If my Benz turned back to Public Transportation, would you still be at home for me with the candles waiting
And get my mind back adjacent to the place of a young visionary?
A player too, you know I have some girls missionary
My black book and numbers thicker than the dictionary and Bible
I got it recycled
I love and I like you
Five course meals, even though you don’t mind a drive-thru
That’s why I got you

281,If Heaven Wasn't So Far Away,"[Verse 1]
Every day I drive to work across Flint River Bridge
A hundred yards from the spot
Where me and grandpa fished
There's a piece of his old fruit stand
On the side of Sawmill Road
He'd be there peeling peaches
If it was twenty years ago
And what I wouldn't give
To ride around in that old truck with him

[Chorus]
If heaven wasn't so far away
I'd pack up the kids and go for the day
Introduce them to their grandpa
Watch them laugh at the way he talks
I'd find my long lost cousin John
The one we left back in Vietnam
Show him a picture of his daughter now
She's a doctor and he'd be proud
Then tell him we'd be back in a couple of days
In the rear view mirror we'd all watch them wave
Yeah, and losing them wouldn't be so hard to take
If heaven wasn't so far away

[Verse 2]
I'd hug all three of those girls
We lost from the class of '99
And I'd find my bird dog Bo
And take him hunting one more time
I'd ask Hank why he took those pills back in '53
And Janis to sing the second verse of
""Me and Bobby McGee""
Sit on a cloud and visit for a while
It'd do me good just to see them smile

[Chorus]
If heaven wasn't so far away
I'd pack up the kids and go for the day
Introduce them to their grandpa
Watch them laugh at the way he talks
I'd find my long lost cousin John
The one we left back in Vietnam
Show him a picture of his daughter now
She's a doctor and he'd be proud
Then tell him we'd be back in a couple of days
In the rear view mirror we'd all watch them wave
Yeah, and losing them wouldn't be so hard to take

Yeah, go!

[Verse 1]
Did you hear the one about me being a punk?
Did you hear the one about me being a drunk?
Did you hear the one about me losing my nerve?
Or how I'm just another fucking sheep in the herd?
Did you hear about the money, how it made me change?
So funny to me, all the time that they waste
Did you hear the one about me giving a shit?
Because if I ever did I don't remember it

[Chorus]
You can be me and I will be you
You can live just like a star
I'll take my sanity, you take the fame
I'm under and over it all
(I'm under and over it)

[Verse 2]
Did you hear the one about me playing the game?
Selling my soul and changing my name
Did you hear the one about me being a prick?
Did you know I don't care? You can suck my
Did you hear the one about me trying to die?
Fist in the air and a finger to the sky
Do I care if you hate me? Do you wanna know the truth?
C'est la vie. Adiós. Good riddance. Fuck you!

[Chorus]
You can be me and I will be you
You can live just like a star
I'll take my sanity, you take the fame
I'm under and over it all
(I'm under and over it)
I, I, I'm under and over it
I, I, I'm under and over it
I, I, I'm under and over it
I, I, I'm under and over it
You can be me and I will be you
You can live just like a star
I'll take my sanity, you take the fame
I'm under and over it all
(I'm under and over it)
I'm under and over it all

Something wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I'm heading home, I'm almost there
I'm on my way, heading up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university

Restraining order, can't see my daughter
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation, we met at Borders
Told her she take me back, I'll be more supportive

Courts sucked me dry, I spent that bread
She need her daddy, baby, please
Can't let her grow up in that ghetto university

284,Ships In The Night,"[Chorus]
Like ships in the night
You keep passing me by
We're just wasting time
Trying to prove who's right
And if it all goes crashing into the sea
If it's just you and me
Trying to find the light

[Verse 1]
Like ships in the night letting cannon balls fly
Say what you mean and it turns to a fight
Fist fly from my mouth as it turns south
You're down the driveway, I'm on the couch
Chasing your dreams since the violent 5th grade
Trying to believe in your silent own way
Cause we'll be ok... I'm not going away
Like you watched at fourteen as it went down the drain
And pops stayed the same and your moms moved away
How many of our parents seem to make it anyway?
We're just fumbling through the grey
Trying find a heart that's not walking away

[Pre-Chorus]
Turn the lights down low
Walk these halls alone
We can feel so far from so close

[Chorus]
Like ships in the night
You keep passing me by
We're just wasting time
Trying to prove who's right
And if it all goes crashing into the sea
If it's just you and me trying to find the light
Like ships in the night
You're passing me by
You're passing me by
Like ships in the night

[Verse 2]
And I'm at the airport waiting on a second plane
Had to pack and you had cramps and I was late
Headed to a red carpet they won't know my name
Riding in silence all that we wanna say
About to board when you call on the phone
You say ""I'm sorry. I'll be waiting at home""
Feels like we're learning this out on our own
Trying to find a way down the road we don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
Turn the lights down low
Walk these halls alone
We can feel so far from so close

[Chorus]
Like ships in the night
You keep passing me by
We're just wasting time
Trying to prove who's right
And if it all goes crashing into the sea
If it's just you and me
Trying to find the light
Like ships in the night
You're passing me by
You're passing me by
Like ships in the night

[Bridge]
And I'm gonna find my way
Back to your side
And I'm gonna find my way
Back to your side

[Chorus]
Like ships in the night
You keep passing me by
We're just wasting time
Trying to prove who's right
And if it all goes crashing into the sea
If it's just you and me
Trying to find the light
Like ships in the night
You're passing me by
You're passing me by
Like ships in the night",Mat Kearney,2011,[87],1

We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us, love people
I'm inspired, so get inspired

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
And so he said ""Why you gotta be so kind-hearted?
Why you couldn't be a con artist? Why you couldn't?
Why you couldn't be mischievous or just a lil' devious
The moment that we first started?
Why you never ask for nothing, just a lil' time?
Why you let me use yours cus I don't got mine?
Why you always lift me up, when I'm completely giving up
Or when niggas holla, ""What's up?"" you give a dry response?
Why you giving me your last knowing you ain't got it?
Why you always buy me something when you going shopping?
Why you tell me that you love me, Why you always thinking of me
Want my company rather than going club hopping?
Why you treating my momma like she your momma too?
Why you making promises that you'll forever do?
Whatever just to make me happy, wanting us to have a family
These are exactly the reasons why I cheat on you"" (Sometimes)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us

[Bridge: Javonte]
Sometimes I, sometimes I feel we share
Nothing in common, it ain't fair
But where do we seem to fall
Where do we seem to fall
Tender love and care, once upon a time
Once upon a time, we was there

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
And so she said ""Why you gotta be so mean to me?
Why you don't know what you mean to me?
Why you always playing games? Why I feel like you ashamed
Out in public curse me out and make a scenery?
Why you got other bitches rolling their eyes at me?
Why text messages popping up saying, ""Hi, Daddy""?
Why you treat me like I'm nothing? Why you always at a function?
I be wanting to go out but you don’t ever ask me
Why you slip and say her name when we having sex?
Why you always assuming that I still like my ex?
Every time we get into it, I'm the one that's feeling stupid
You don't need me, you gon' leave me, that's ya favorite threat
Why you never know how it feel to be lonely?
Why I feel I'm the last option after ya homies?
Why you always gotta know that I will never let you go
Even tho you get violent and put your hands on me?"" (Sometimes)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us

Sometimes I, sometimes I feel we share
Nothing in common, it ain't fair
But where do we seem to fall
Where do we seem to fall
Tender love and care, once upon a time
Once upon a time, we was there

[Outro: Lamont Carey]
She says she loves me
She says she loves me
So she clings to me, even when I want to be left alone
But she's beautiful
Like, sometimes, when I have things on my mind, she's the perfect person to listen
And she only gives advice, she says, when I give her a cue
She says she loves me
Like when I wake up in the morning, she's sitting on the edge of the bed with a plate of food, wanting to feed me
She says she needs me
She says she loves me
Or like when I'm stepping out of the shower, she's standing there with the towel, wanting to, wanting to dry me off
She says, she says she loves me
So instead of admitting that she has made another mistake
She says she loves me... and I don't know about love",Kendrick Lamar,2011,"[44, 36, 36, 39, 46, 46, 45, 45, 47, 52, 48, 52, 52, 61, 62, 63, 67, 70, 75, 96, 86]",21

Every single record, autotuning
Zero emotion, muted emotion
Pitch corrected, computed emotion, uh-huh
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile, ow
Stripper booty and a rack like wow, Brain like Berkeley
Met her at Coachella
I went to see Jigga, she went to see Z Trip, perfect
I took a seat on the ice cold lawn
She handed me a ice blue bong, whatever
She said she wanna be a dentist really badly
She's in school paying
For tuition, doing porn in the Valley, at least you workin'
But, girl, I can't feel my face
What are we smoking anyway?
She said ""don't let the high go to waste""
But can you taste a little taste

Bed full of women, flip on a tripod, little red light on shootin'

Been tryna film pleasure with my eyes wide shut but it keeps on movin'

Today's a new day, but there is no sunshine
Nothing but clouds, and it's dark in my heart
And it feels like a cold night
Today's a new day, but where are my blue skies
Where is the love and the joy that you promised me?
Tell me it's alright

About yourself, you were wrong

Chased down all my demons

Pull 'n' fuckin' fire when I leave 'em, you shoulda seen 'em

And snitches get dealt with, with no love

Picture me blasted, surrounded by niggas in masks
Sent with the task to harass and murder my ass
Will I last? Heaven or Hell? Freedom or jail?
Shit's hard, who can you tell? And if we fail?
High speeds, and Thai weed on the freeway
When will they learn to take it easy? Uh
Drive-by's and niggas die, murder without a motive
By makin' motherfuckers fry
Got me runnin' from these coward-ass crooked-ass cops
Helicopters tryna hover over niggas 'til we drop
Got no time for the court, my only thought is open fire
Hit the district attorney, but fuck that bitch, cause she's a liar
Now it's time to expire, I see the judge, spray the bitch
""Motherfuckers is crooked,"" is what I scream, and hit the fence
I commence to get wicked, spittin' rounds as the plot thickens
Never missin', an early grave is my only mission
If I die, never worry, bury me beside my four-five

I can't fuck with ho niggas, I can't trust these hoes neither
Wake up early in the mornin', eat that pussy like cold pizza
Hatin' ass niggas be baller blocking, actin' like some goalkeepers
There's a reason for everything, but my niggas kill for no reason
Camo shorts with a ho-beater, all-black hoodie, I'm Grim Reaper
Look like it's time for spring cleaning
Brand-new spanking streetsweeper
Been in the game, I'm knee deeper
I like good head, I like good reefer
All my niggas strapped and ready to set it off, Queen Latifah
Got a chopper with a drum, split Swishers with my thumb
Get money like Donald Trump, double-barrel on that pump
This kush I got ain't no chump, get stupid and get stomped
Two guns, I call 'em Kriss Kross, Kriss Kross'll make you jump
Gotta do what a nigga gotta do
Got goons, I ain't even gotta shoot
Got a bunch of bad bitches by the pool, I like my bitches in twos
Gotta go, I stick it and move, G-code, I stick to the rules
Last night I got so high I swear to God I went to the moon
I'm on that shit you can't get nowhere
You pussy boy, don't go there
If I don't do nothing I'mma ball, no hair
Smoking on that ""Oh yeah,"" my niggas tote that hardware
What you 'bout, whoadie? My niggas 'bout that warfare
Real nigga since day one 'cause I ain't promised day two
Throw that pussy at me, bitch, I think I'm Babe Ruth
Droptop Maybach on the way, yeah, that's that new Landaulet
She let me into her jungle, I'm gonna hit her with that rattlesnake
Guns clap like patty-cake, Blood gang red bandana face
Make them pussies pop they self, you can call that ""masturbate""
I don't front, don't fabricate, I get high, I gravitate
Weezy F. Baby, bitch, the ""F"" is for Fascinate
Louisiana, I'm from that swamp, I'ma pull this bitch out and dump
Better run like Forrest Gump, fuck you and where you from
Three, Two, I am the One, job well done
I ball 24/7, 3-6-5, twelve months

All this designer on my body got me drip, drip, ayy
Straight up out the Yajects, I'm a big Crip
If I got a pint of lean, I'ma sip, sip

But I got rich on all these niggas, I didn't forget, back
I had to go through the struggle, I didn't forget that
I hopped inside of the Maybach and now I can sit back
These bitches know me now 'cause I got them big racks
'Cause I'm gettin' money now, I know you heard that
Young nigga on the corner, bitch, I had to serve crack
Uncle fronted me some P's, had to get them birds back
We came up on dirty money, I gave it a birdbath

A nigga like me, man, I love the game, I love the hustle, man
I be feeling like one of them ball playing niggas, you know?
A Bird, a Magic, or something, yeah, you know a nigga got dough
A nigga can leave the league, but if I leave
The fans still gonna love me, man?

We hustle hard in the city of Gods
With dedicated dealers, take this shit for a serious job
Thugs with hideous scars, bag the prettiest broads
And teach 'em how to move coke in they panties and bra's
My pops stayed on the hustle cause the family was large
No fancy cars, no shrimp scampi or caviar
Just a cold plate of agony mixed with a harsh reality
Fuck a donation, we started our own charities
We had to hustle, we ain't caking like Russell
So if you live how we live, you can relate to the struggle
Me and my niggas running wild like some apes in the jungle
Paper chasing, serving fiends, at the gate when they come through
This one's for all my Newport slingers, dope heads that'll chew off fingers
Just to shoot that thing up, get on ya grind
Cause while your getting yours, I'm getting mines
If you need some tips on how to hustle, drop me a line

Hustle hard, that's the only way a nigga know how
Been grinding most of my life, and I ain't gon' stop now
Growing up, I remember them days, slinging that beige
Pumping trays on the first of the month, niggas was paid
I learned the tricks of the trade, with the flip or the save
When you bag up, wear rubber gloves and clean off the blade
I used to watch my older brother carve stones at the table
And my moms home, it was new to my 'view', like Star Jones
In and out of buildings, lamping in halls with eight balls
Way before they had the cameras installed
That was 9-7, when Biggie Smalls gave us the script
The Ten Crack Commandments on how to manage your bricks
Shopping bags, popping tags, with the brand new in shit
No more hand-me-down rags, my appearance was dipped
I'm on my grind like coffee beans, I'm gon' sale
Worldwide I got fiends on line like AOL

Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

[Verse 2]
You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

I was so surrounded but still all alone
A great big house but so far from home
How'd you breathe life in this heart of soul

I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
Me, she fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait!
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No, you ain't!
Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?

You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?

307,Country Song,"[Verse 1]
A dirt road, a cold beer
A blue jeans, a red pickup
A rural noun, simple adjective
No shoes, no shirt
No Jews, you didn't hear that
Sort of a mental typo

[Pre-Chorus]
I walk and talk like a field hand
But the boots I'm wearing cost three grand
I write songs about riding tractors
From the comfort of a private jet

[Chorus]
I could sing in Mandarin
You'd still know I'm pandering
Huntin' deer and chasing trout
A Bud Light with the logo facing out
Hear that subtle mandolin
That's textbook panderin'
I own a private ranch that I rarely use
I don't like dirt

[Spoken]
One verse, one chorus in the bag
Now it's time to talk to the ladies
I'm hoping my Southern charm offsets all these rape-y vibes I'm puttin' out

[Verse 2]
Good girl in a straw hat
With her arms out in a corn field
That is a scarecrow
Thought that was a human woman, sorry
A cold night, a cold beer
A cold jeans, strike that last one
I'm wanting you, I hope you're feeling me
Sub-textually

[Pre-Chorus]
We go to bed, you doze off
So I take your country girl clothes off
I put my hands on your body
It feels like hay, it's a fucking scarecrow again

[Chorus]
Like Mike’s Evander-ing
Fuck your ears I'm pandering
I write songs for the people who do
Jobs in the towns that I'd never move to
Legalize gerry-mandering
Tolerate my pandering
You got a beautiful mouth
I got a beautiful (dick)

Y'all dumb motherfuckers want a key change?

[Bridge]
Thematically meandering
Emphatically pandering
I got a tight grip on my demo's balls
Say the word ""truck,"" they jizz in their overalls

I'm in the land of pandering
And I'll be upfront

When you were waiting on the edge of the unknown

You build up hope, but failure's all you've known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go, let it go

And in a burst of light that blinded every angel
As if the sky had blown the heavens into stars
You felt the gravity of tempered grace
Falling into empty space
No one there to catch you in their arms

Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure’s all you’ve known

In your hands there is nothing that you can’t fix
My heart is frayed, my scars are open
So put me back together now stitch by stitch
Put me back together now stitch by stitch

What you say, without words
Resuscitates what was numb inside
So repair me every thread of me
Cause you’re bringing me back to life

In your hands there’s nothin’ that you can’t fix

Somehow its takin’ over me
Don’t ever let me let it go

Ayo, the flyest ma'fucker in the room, yeah, you know it's me
Bitches hatin' on him ‘cause he started out here locally
Hopefully I'll be at the top soon
For now I'm at my house on the couch watchin' cartoons
You know how much you love it when you get it in abundance
Give a fuck about a budget when you always be the subject of discussion
But it's nothin' when you stop and just say fuck it
‘Cause you walkin' out in public and you hear them talkin' rubbish

That's the way it goes when you party just like I do
Bitches on my dick that used to brush me off in high school

Style come with excellence and money make benevolence
Irrelevant for the fuckers who never been intelligent

Tell a bitch that she better bring a friend
And if she want an autograph she better bring a pen
Yeah, the party never end, this life is what I recommend
And if you got a ho picked for me then she better be a 10
I ain't picky, but these girls be actin' tricky
When the situation's sticky and the liquor got 'em silly

I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need somethin' to pull me out this dump

Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when
I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent
But I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
I need a new outlet
And I know some shit's so hard to swallow
But I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact:
I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles—

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Verse 2]
I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything's so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature
Of the room, just as soon as
I walk in, it's like all eyes on me
So I try to avoid any eye contact
‘Cause if I do that, then it opens a door
For conversation like I want that
I'm not lookin' for extra attention
I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant
Tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny, like, ""Ha!
Marshall, you're so funny, man
You should be a comedian, goddamn!""
Unfortunately I am
I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down?
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles—

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Verse 3]
Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now, I could've either just sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid
Aunt Edna always told me:
""Keep making that face, it'll get stuck like that.""
Meanwhile, I'm just standin' there
Holdin' my tongue, tryin' to talk like this
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then
‘Cause I wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no mo'
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
‘Cause where you see it from where you're sittin'
It's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each other's shoes at least
What size you wear? I wear 10's
Let's see if you can fit your feet—

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Bridge]
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
Then I'm reaching out for you

[Outro]
Yeah, to my babies: stay strong
Daddy'll be home soon
And to the rest of the world: God gave you them shoes to fit you
So put 'em on and wear 'em, be yourself, man
Be proud of who you are, even if it sounds corny
Never let no one tell you you ain't beautiful",Eminem,2011,[74],1
320,Afraid To Sleep,"We slept in this room together but now you're gone
And it's so quiet I turn the TV on
We lived in this room together, we painted the walls
Now time doesn't stand still, it crawls

And I'm afraid to sleep
'Cause if I do I dream of you
And dreams are always deep
On the pillow where I weep

I never realized how much I was in love with you
Until you started sleeping with someone new
Last night I dreamed again and you were there
You kissed my face you touched my hair

And I'm afraid to sleep
'Cause if I do I dream of you
And dreams are always deep
On the pillow where I weep

Lying alone in the darkness
With the memory in my head
There's a big hole where my heart is
And a lonely feeling rollin' round my bed

And I'm afraid to sleep
'Cause if I do I dream of you
I'm afraid to sleep
'Cause if I do I dream of you
And dreams are always deep
On the pillow where I weep
On the pillow where I weep

I'm afraid to sleep",Dido,2011,[78],1

323,Losing My Religion,"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Oh, life is bigger
It's bigger than you and you are not me
The lengths that I will go to the distance in your eyes
Oh no, I've said too much, I set it up

[Pre-Chorus]
That's me in the corner, that's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you and I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much, I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

Every whisper of every waking hour I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt, lost and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much, I set it up

[Pre-Chorus]
Consider this, consider this, the hint of the century
Consider this the slip that brought me to my knees, failed
What if all these fantasies come flailing around?
Now I've said too much

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
That was just a dream

324,Moving To Mars,"[Verse 1]
Somewhere up above the stars
The wreckage of a universe floats past
Somewhere up above my heart
A tiny little seed is sown, a government is overthrown
Who knows when we'll be coming home at last

[Chorus]
And I heard it on the radio that one day we'll be living in the stars
And I heard it on a TV show that somewhere up above and in my heart
They'll be tearing us apart, maybe moving us to Mars
We won't see the earth again
And the seconds just remain unchanged

[Verse 2]
8 to 9, 9 to 10
We are meeting for the first time
We might never meet again, you and me
We are meeting for the first time can't you see
7 6 5 4 3
We are meeting for the first time
Singing this space symphony

They'll be tearing us apart, maybe moving us to Mars
Past the satellites and stars, they're moving us to Mars",Coldplay,2011,[90],1

You know that I brought a plate
Cause you told me you only work from 6-to-9
Wait you know I'm off at 8
I'm tryin' to contemplate and concentrate on where to take your ass
I think I got a place, backseat of my car
I ain't got a place, but baby you're my
Thoughts have been nasty
I wanna smash me a bad piece
Introduce her whole face to my family
You ain't gotta ask me what the plan be
The condom plan A, without one, plan B
Fill up your damn jeans
Finna know baby I spill that damn cheese
No hands, I use my teeth and pull down your panties
Then focus on that sweet thang, open your pantry
I admire her for her, I would hire her to twerk
I'm not inspired to search for nobody else
That gushy too gucci, gushy way flyer than a purse
The way we grinding in this backseat, hope these tires ain't gon' burst
Swear to God

330,Dog Days Are Over,"[Verse 1]
Happiness hit her, like a train on a track
Coming towards her, stuck still no turning back
She hid around corners and she hid under beds
She killed it with kisses and from it she fled
With every bubble she sank with a drink
And washed it away down the kitchen sink

[Chorus]
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
The horses are coming
So you better run
Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come

[Bridge]
And I never wanted anything from you
Except everything you had
And what was left after that too, oh

[Verse 2]
Happiness hit her like a bullet in the back, back, back...
Struck from a great height
By someone who should know better than that

I ain't the kind you take home to mama
I ain't the kind to wear no ring

Going back to the corner where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand
Saying ""If you see this girl, can you tell her where I am?""

I know it makes no sense, what else can I do?
How can I move on when I'm still in love with you?

'Cause if one day you wake up, and find that you're missing me

When somebody throws sticks and stones
All they can break are your bones
And life's going to kick you around
Then kick you again when you're down

And nothing can stand in your way
Today is your day
Everything's going your way
Today, today, today, today

Life's going to kick
It's going to kick you around
It's going to kick you down

Brush yourself up, no regrets
This is as good as it gets
Don't expect more or less
Just go out and give it your best

[Chorus]
That today is your day
And nothing can stand in your way
Today is your day
Everything's going your way
Today, today, today, today

341,Jolene,"[Guitar Introduction]

[Chorus]
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can

[Verse 1]
Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene

[Verse 2]
He talks about you in his sleep
There's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene
And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene

[Chorus]
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can

[Verse 3]
You could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me, Jolene
I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene

[Chorus]
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can

342,I Need A Doctor,"[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long
I’m runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I told the world, one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it, so that one day I could play it back
But I don’t even know if I believe it when I’m sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, every day it's just so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that
‘Cause no one sees my vision when I play it for ‘em
They just say it's wack — but they don’t know what dope is
And I don’t know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fightin' you
It’s dark, let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
‘Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick; you
Gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin' mic, or you
Gon' hug me, but I'm outta options, there's nothin' else I can do
‘Cause—

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long
I’m runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It hurts when I see you struggle; you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I’m puzzled, ‘cause the shit I hear is
Crazy, but you're either gettin' lazy or you don’t believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
Like I’m your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me when everyone was tellin' you
Don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth!
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I’m cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith
And you ain't givin' up on me — get up, Dre!
I'm dyin', I need you, come back for fuck’s sake! ‘Cause—

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long
I’m runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them?
I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends! All I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers!
When the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots!
You gon' see us in our lab jackets
And ask us where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots!
And the cracker's ass, little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack math, backwards producers; I'm back, bastards!
One more CD and then I’m packin' up my bags, and as
I’m leavin', I’ll guarantee they'll scream:
""Dre, don’t leave us like that, man!"" ‘cause—

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]

(woo-hoo,woo-hoo)

Well my heart knows me better than I know myself
So I'm gonna let it do all the talking
(woo-hoo,woo-hoo)
I came across a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree
(woo-hoo,woo-hoo)

I fell in fear, upon my back
I said don't look back, just keep on walking
(woo-hoo,woo-hoo)
When the big black horse that looked this way
Said hey lady, will you marry me?
(woo-hoo,woo-hoo)

But I said no, no, no,no-no-no
I said no, no, you're not the one for me
No, no, no,no-no-no
I said no, no, you're not the one for me

(ooooo,woo-hoo)

And my heart had a problem, in the early hours
So it stopped it dead for a beat or two
(woo-hoo,woo-hoo)
But I cut some cord, and I shouldn't have done that
And it won't forgive me after all these years
(woo-hoo,woo-hoo)

So I sent her to a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree
(woo-hoo,woo-hoo)
Now it won't come back , cause it's oh so happy
And now I've got a hole for the world to see
(woo-hoo,woo-hoo)

But it said no, no, no,no-no-no
I said no, no, you're not the one for me
No, no, no,no-no-no
Said no, no, you're not the one for me

344,The Cave,"[Verse 1]
It's empty in the valley of your heart
The sun, it rises slowly as you walk
Away from all the fears
And all the faults you've left behind

The harvest left no food for you to eat
You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see
But I have seen the same
I know the shame in your defeat

[Chorus]
But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

[Verse 2]
Cause I have other things to fill my time
You take what is yours and I'll take mine
Now let me at the truth
Which will refresh my broken mind

So tie me to a post and block my ears
I can see widows and orphans through my tears
I know my call despite my faults
And despite my growing fears

[Chorus]
But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

[Verse 3]
So come out of your cave walking on your hands
And see the world hanging upside down
You can understand dependence
When you know the maker's land

So make your siren's call
And sing all you want
I will not hear what you have to say

Cause I need freedom now
And I need to know how
To live my life as it's meant to be

I tried to look away from what you did

You walked away from me, baby
I would've never done the same
You made me feel like our love was not real
You threw it all away, so

I shoot the lights out
Hide 'til it's bright out
Oh, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?

[Intro Verse: Rick Ross]
Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good blood-sucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I get it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Uh, the best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
No matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple double, no assists
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Arguing with my older bitch, acting like I owe her shit
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, ""This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now""
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it ""Malibooyah""
Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit 'em with a new style?
Know that motherfucker well: ""What you gon' do now?""
Whatever I wanna do, gosh! It's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So mommy, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ahh, put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship
I'm living in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass

[Chorus: Kanye West, Jay Z & both]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert (Yeah)
Profit, profit, nigga, I get it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
(I'm a motherfucking monster)
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness
Goblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question: What do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfucking monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles, I
Kill the block, I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles' heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and blood-suckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Milling about, spilling they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert

Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

Pull up in the monster, automobile gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah I'm in that Tonka, color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king but watch the queen conquer
Okay, first things first, I'll eat your brains
Then I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a motherfucking monster do
Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, ""Dutty Wine"" it, wylin'
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really, really I don't give a F-U-C-K
""Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki 'cause she's fake""
""She on a diet,"" but my pockets eating cheesecake
And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's Child's Play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, 'Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Am should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Aaaah, I'm a motherfucking monster!

[Outro: Bon Iver & Charlie Wilson]
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide (decide)
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home

Around my head, your information
But there's no hiding behind moulting feathers

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
On the plane, on my brain, 'bout to do the show
40K contract? Take get out the door
Dice symbolise my life, roll 'em on the floor
From your grubby hands as you ham and grandstand
You live a shitty life, we live the bon bon vie
You hide it in the book while we watch the TV
Think you got us fooled? Who? Never again
First time, shame on me, second time, your time will end

Cruel world is fittin', they got us all hidden
With late night divisions and lab rat incisions
But faced with decisions to fight or fricasse
And you clearly decided on how to handle me
Difficile, imbecile, is it fake? Is it real?
Are we dyin' on our feet? Are we tryin' in our sleep?
There's a rumor goin' 'round 'bout the suits runnin' town
If you look into the sky, dead birds fly high, high, high

You're logging hours and don't see the big picture
Over your shoulder, you'll get no last words
Because it's too late, you've clipped your own wings

How many stories? (So many tall tales)
We climb the structure (We scale the ladder)

I have a laugh

When I love
I give it all I've got

Like my mother does
When I feel weak and unpretty
I know I'm beautiful and strong
Because I see myself
Like my mother does

[Verse 2]
I never met a stranger
I can talk to anyone
Like my mother does
I let my temper fly
And she can walk away
When she's had enough
She sees everybody
For who they really are
I'm so thankful for her guidance
She helped me get this far

When I love
I give it all I've got

And wonders if her love is strong enough to make him stay

He said, I want to see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?

And you ain't ever gonna change

And you were born for leavin'

The night is black as the coffee he was drinkin'
And in the waitress' eyes he sees the same old light is shinin'
He thinks of Colorado and the girl he left behind him

[Chorus]
When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hopin' that I can borrow
A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck
Had went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands
My plan's rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back, whispering ""Get 'em!""
I got 'em and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a youngin
In pajamas and dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb
Niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted
This Piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever
And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop, I hope— [Gunshots]

Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Verse 2]
You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it Section.80
The message resembled ""Brenda's Got a Baby""
What's crazy was I was hearin' about it
But doubted your ignorance
How could you ever just put her on blast and shit?
Judgin' her past and shit?
Well, it's completely my future
Her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit
And I'ma need that forty dollars
Even if I got to fuck, suck and swallow
In the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed
By a married man, and father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys
Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em
Back to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'
Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted, but fuck that ""Sorry for your loss"" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait… Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate
And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'
I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'
You lyin' to these motherfuckers
Talkin' about you can help 'em with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit...

When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I look in the mirror
And ask myself: Am I really scared of passin' away?
If it's today, I hope I hear a
Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'
The scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed
May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about, ’cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
In a direction to speak on somethin'
That's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like ""It need to be told""
Cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'
Or steady bein' distracted by money, drugs and 4-5's
I count lives, all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in?

[Chorus]
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Outro]
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh

""Ay, ay, ay, Where you 'bout to go?""
""Nigga, the homie's brother-- nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone!""
""Nigga-- they just killed the homie's brother, my nigga. We right here on the block, my nigga.""
""Al- alright, nigga-- nigga just come-- alright, alright, just call me back, man, just call me back.""
[Hangs up]
""Arghh... Fuck!
So what we gon' do, my niggas? What we gon' do?""
""Bro, we can go back right now, my nigga. Like... nigga, I don't give a fuck, my nigga. We can go back right now""
""Fuck! I'm tired of this shit! I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit! My brother, homie!""

[Verse 1]
Tired of runnin', tired of huntin'
My own kind, but retirin' nothin'
Tires are steady screechin', the driver is rubbin'
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst?

[Verse 2]
Dope on the corner, look at the coroner
Daughter is dead, mother is mournin' her
Stray bullets, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waitin' patiently, but they couldn't
Bring her back, who got the footage?
Channel 9, cameras is lookin'
It's hard to channel your energy when you know he crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

[Verse 3]
How many sins? I'm runnin' out
How many sins? I lost count
Dreams of ballin' like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper callin', I'm cottonmouth
Money is power (Money is power)
Yours is ours (Yours is ours)
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song, a black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst, dye your thirst, dye your thirst

[Verse 4]
What are we doin'? Who are we foolin'?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
Tired of runnin', choirs is hummin'
Tell us to visit, we lie about comin'
Now back to business, loadin' the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feudin'
The beef is bubblin', it's no discussion
Hereditary, all of my cousins
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

[Verse 5]
Too many sins, I'm runnin' out
Somebody send me a well for the drought
See all I know is takin' notes
On takin' this life for granted, granted, if he provoke
My best days, I stress days
(Lord, forgive me for all my sins, for I not know—)
My best days, I stress days
Say ""fuck the world,"" my sex slave
Money, pussy, and greed – what's my next crave?
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of runnin', tired of runnin', tired of tumblin'
Tired of runnin', tired of tumblin' – backwards
My momma say ""See, a pastor give me a promise
What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished?
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dyin' of thirst, you dyin' of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works.""

[Skit/Outro]
Fuck! I’m tired of this shit!
I’m tired of fuckin' runnin', I’m tired of this shit!
That’s my brother, homie!
Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?
I know that's not what I think that is
Why are you so angry?
See, you young men are dying of thirst
Do you know what that means?
That means you need water, holy water
You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord
Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?
Okay, repeat after me:
""Lord God, I come to You a sinner.""
(Lord God, I come to You a sinner)
""And I humbly repent for my sins.""
(And I humbly repent for my sins)
""I believe that Jesus is Lord.""
(I believe that Jesus is Lord)
""I believe you raised Him from the dead.""
(I believe you raised Him from the dead)
""I would ask that Jesus come into my life.""
(I would ask that Jesus come in my life)
""And be my Lord and Savior.""
(And be my Lord and Savior)
""I receive Jesus to take control of my life.""
(I receive Jesus to take control of my life)
""And that I may live for Him from this day forward.""
(And that I may live for Him from this day forward)
""Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood.""
(Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood)
""In Jesus name, amen.""

365,For Good,"[ELPHABA]
I'm limited
Just look at me
I'm limited
And just look at you
You can do all I couldn't do, Glinda
So now it's up to you
For both of us
Now it's up to you

[GLINDA]
I've heard it said
That people come into our lives
For a reason
Bringing something we must learn
And we are led
To those who help us most to grow
If we let them
And we help them in return
Well, I don't know if I believe that's true
But I know I'm who I am today
Because I knew you

Like a comet pulled from orbit
As it passes a sun
Like a stream that meets a boulder
Halfway through the wood
Who can say if I've been changed for the better?
But because I knew you
I have been changed for good

[ELPHABA]
It well may be
That we will never meet again
In this lifetime
So let me say before we part
So much of me
Is made of what I learned from you
You'll be with me
Like a handprint on my heart
And now whatever way our stories end
I know you have re-written mine
By being my friend

Like a ship blown from its mooring
By a wind off the sea
Like a seed dropped by a skybird
In a distant wood
Who can say if I've been changed for the better?
But because I knew you

[GLINDA]
Because I knew you

[BOTH]
I have been changed for good

[ELPHABA]
And just to clear the air
I ask forgiveness
For the things I've done
You blame me for

[GLINDA]
But then, I guess
We know there's blame to share

[BOTH]
And none of it seems to matter anymore

[GLINDA & ELPHABA]
Like a comet pulled from orbit
Like a ship blown from its mooring
As it passes a sun
By a wind off the sea
Like a stream that meets a boulder
Like a seed dropped by a bird
Halfway through the wood
In the wood

Who can say
If I've been changed for the better?
I do believe I have been changed for the better

I have been changed

And you said, ""Rise above""
Open your eyes up
And you said, ""Rise above""
But I can't
I can't

How long will it take
Before these feelings go away?
How much longer must I wait?
And are there any real answers, anyway?
Yeah

Your silence in a crowded room
Louder than the loudest tune
I hang on every word

And you said, ""Rise above""
Open your eyes up
And you said, ""Rise above""
But I can't
I can't

I miss you in everything
I was too fast travelling
To take you in
I know that silence is no crime
Just wish I could hear you fill it up
One more time

Yeah, I know what you'd say to me
Exactly what you'd say to me
I still hang on every word

And you said, ""Rise above""
Open your eyes up
And you said, ""Rise above
Yourself""

In a time of treason
Is there time for trust?
Where there's no them
Only us
Is there time for reason?
Has your heart had enough?
Is it time to let go
And rise above?

And you said, ""Rise above""
Open your eyes to love
And you said, ""Rise above
Yourself""",Bono & The Edge,2011,[74],1

Forty's just a feature, charge you fifty for the after-party

Dumbass nigga with a mouth full of hate
Grab my AK and chop 'em up
Still fuck at least ten bitches a day
Like I'm a pornagrapher

Ice cream's backordered

No commin' back

Trappin' with my gutter chick, work up in her coochie
Dope man Nike's, Levi's with the white tee
I fucked my money up, now I think that they don't like me

You know that I'm gunning

I'm Just trying to see another day
Yesterday it was okay
Hopefully today'll be better though
Hopefully I'll get some better blow
Snowflakes out here finna go
I'm just trying to keep my ho
Hopefully I'll hit the lotto
I'm so tired of sellin' this stone
Every day we live for the moment
Every second we got to do what we go to do
If I finessed you, I had to
I had to do what I had to do
You retaliate, can't be mad at you
Gotta do what you gotta do
I can't take offense to it
Still, I gotta play defense
Cold-hearted amphibians
In this street, all this slime
Nigga told you he ain't never thought he hit no lick
That nigga lyin'

Free my conscious, free my mind

I've waited for the right
Moment to let you know
I don't wanna let you go

But now I've realized
There's just no perfect time
To confess how I feel
This much I know is real

So I refuse to
Waste one more second
Without you
Knowing my heart

Baby 'cause I don't
Need anything else but your love
Nothing but you means a thing to me
I'm incomplete

When you're not there
Holding me, touching me
I swear
All of the rest could just disappear
And I wouldn't even care
As long as you're there

Take these words
Don't let them go unheard
This is me reaching out
I hope you can hear me now

'Cause baby my heart's at stake
Take it, it's yours to break
I'd rather try and lose
Than keep this love from you
Yeah

So I refuse to
Waste one more second
Without you
Knowing my heart

Baby 'cause I don't
Need anything else but your love
Nothing but you means a thing to me
I'm incomplete

When you're not there
Holding me, touching me
I swear
All of the rest could just disappear
And I wouldn't even care
As long as you're there

Each day and night
That I've kept this a secret
It'd killed me
It's time
To share what I feel inside

No, I don't

I see you callin', I be makin' it quick
I'ma answer that shit like, ""I don't fuck with you.""
Bitch, I got no feelings to go
I swear I had it up to here, I got no ceilings to go
I mean, for real, fuck how you feel
Fuck your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill
Yeah, and every day I wake up celebratin' shit
Why? ‘Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy bitch
I stuck to my guns, that's what made me rich
That's what put me on, that's what got me here
That's what made me this
And everything that I do is my first name (B-I-G)
These hoes chase bread, aw damn, she got a bird brain
Ain't nothin' but trill in me, aw man, silly me
I just bought a crib, three stories; that bitch a trilogy
And you know I'm rollin' weed that's fuckin' up the ozone
I got a bitch that text me she ain't got no clothes on
And then another one text, then your ass next
And I'ma text your ass back, like…

[Verse 2: E-40]
Got a million things on my mind, executive deals online
Limited amount of time, chasin' these dollar signs
And you ain't on your grind
You liable to find me up in the MGM casino in the D
Fuckin' off fetti I could've put on property
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten
My niggas put murder missions
She choosin', that's her decision, free my niggas in prison
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich
Got a blunt in my dental, blowin' hemp in a rental
On my way to Sacramento, late night; Arsenio
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless
Barely Harley, I'm chromeless, you might end up domeless
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I'll make a bitch stand outside forever, like the Statue of Liberty
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South
I raise my styrofoam up, and pour some drink in my mouth
Why you always coming around with bad news?
Say you want me to win, but hope I lose
Askin' if I rock with other niggas in the crew
But them niggas cool, it's just that…

I got a new chick that I gotta thank God for
I got a new whip that I gotta thank the lot for
Yeah, I got a lot but want a lot more
Yeah, we in the buildin', but I'm tryna take it to the top floor
I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up
It seem like nowadays everybody breakin' up
That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til you're unconscious
Feel me when you get a fine bitch
Just don't forget to read the fine print
Life got me meditatin' like I'm in the Himalayas
Keep it G with the L lit on me like the elevator
Yeah, I know that karma's too real
So I hope you doin' cool, but still…

Best believe that when we're done, this moment will be syndicated
I don't know, this night just reminds me of
Everything they deprived me of (Kyuh!)

I wanna kiss you (Yeah), don't wanna miss you (Yeah)

Bad vibes, where'd the fun go? (Oh)

381,My Man,"[Intro]
Ohh, ohh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Boy, you let me down
I am so confused
I stood right by your side
Through everything that you went through
Why is she around?
Why are you so cruel?
How could you just turn your back
When I stood by you?

When you were broke, I didn't leave you
Somehow, through it all, I believed in you
No, no, no
My, my, my
'Cause he would never hurt me
Let alone, just desert me
No, no, no
My, my, my

[Verse 2]
Word around town
Is that you live with her
And you said she took your heart away, oh baby
I told them, that's a lie
Cause I don't wanna hear no bullshit stories 'bout my man
(Can't stop the screamin' and yellin')
Oh, no, no, no, no
My pain, oh no
No, I just can't believe that you're with her
Is she the one you played me for?
Shoulda noticed it the day she walked in the door
I just can't believe she stole my man
Oh, my man (Oh, yeah)
She walked right in the door
Looked me in the face, and she took my man
Never trust a lonely woman with the one you love
She ate dinner at my table, even watched my kids
And she took my man
Bitch actin' like she was my friend
She called me 'bout her man
Well, I didn't understand
She was talkin' 'bout my man (heifer)
Oh my man, my man, my man, my man, my man
My man, man, man, man, woo!

[Bridge]
Is this my life?
It cuts me like a knife
To know the one I love could leave me for a friend
I'm not desperate, but I would reconsider (baby, are you sorry?)
All the years I put in this thing to be a winner
I know it's too late
She took my man (took my man)

[Outro]
See, I was just a fool
Didn't wanna see the truth, and she took my man
And my heart screams out loud
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, woah (took my man)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (took my man)
Oh, oh, oh, oh (not my man)
Not my man, no, no, no (not my man)",Tamar Braxton,2011,[94],1

Passent les clashs, guerres, ma carrière est cellophanée

You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

[Verse 1]
Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

[Chorus]
You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

[Verse 2]
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave 'em burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another, anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

[Chorus]
You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah

392,I Am Woman,"I am woman, hear me roar
In numbers too big to ignore
And I know too much to go back an' pretend
Cause I've heard it all before
And I've been down there on the floor
No one's ever gonna keep me down again

Oh yes, I am wise
But it's wisdom born of pain
Yes, I've paid the price
But look how much I gained
If I have to, I can do anything
I am strong
(Strong)
I am invincible
(Invincible)
I am woman

You can bend but never break me
Cause it only serves to make me
More determined to achieve my final goal
And I come back even stronger
Not a novice any longer
Cause you've deepened the conviction in my soul

Oh yes, I am wise
But it's wisdom born of pain
Yes, I've paid the price
But look how much I gained
If I have to, I can do anything
I am strong

I am invincible

I am woman watch me grow
See me standing toe to toe
As I spread my lovin' arms across the land
But I'm still an embryo
With a long, long way to go
Until I make my brother understand

393,Fast Lane,"[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9""]
Uh, first verse, uh, I'm armed 'til I'm on an island
My life's ridin' on the autobahn on autopilot
Before I touch dirt, or kill y'all with kindness
I kill ya, my natural persona's much worse
You've been warned if you've been borned or if you conformed
Slap up a cop and then snatch him outta his uniform
Leave him with his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on
And hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn
Y'all niggas' intellect mad slow, y'all fags know
Claimin' you bangin', you flamin'
Bet you could light your own cigarette with your asshole
Me and Shady deaded the past, so
That basically resurrected my cashflow
I might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke
Though I ain't wrapped tight, my blood type's the 80s
My 90s was like the Navy, you was like the Brady's
You still fly kites daily

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Catch me in my Mercedes, bumpin' ""Ice Ice Baby""
Screaming, ""Shady 'til I die!""
Like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy
So I live it to the fullest 'til I'm Swayze
And you only live it once, so I'm thinking 'bout this nice, nice lady
Wait, no, stop me now 'fore I get on a roll (Danish)
Let me tell you what this pretty little dame's name is
‘Cause she's kinda famous
And I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this
Nicki Minaj, but I wanna stick my penis in your anus
You morons think that I'm a genius
Really, I belong inside a dang insane asylum
Came to drive them trailer parks crazy
I am back, and I am razor-sharp, baby
And that's ""back"" with a capital B with an exclamation mark
Maybe you should listen when I flip the linguistics
‘Cause when I rip this mystical slick shit
You don't wanna become another victim, a statistic of this shit
‘Cause after I spit the bullets
I'ma treat these shell casings like a soccer ball
I'ma kick the ballistics; so get this dick, I'ma live this—

[Chorus: Sly Jordan]
I'm livin' life in the fast lane
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank
But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now
I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride
Just gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die
I'm livin' life in the fast lane (pedal to the metal)
I'm livin' life in the fast lane (pedal to the metal)

[Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9""]
Uh, yeah, my whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit
At war with a bottle as Captain Morgan attacks my organs (C'mon)
My slow flow is euphoric, it's like I rap endorphins
I made a pact with the devil that says
""I'll let you take me, you let me take a shovel
Dig up the corpse of Jack Kevorkian"" (C'mon)
Go back and forth and, more beef than you can pack a fork in
I'm livin' the life of the infinite enemy, down
My tenement chimney now, the semi’s the remedy, pow
Spin him around, enterin' in the vicinity—

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Now, was called M&M
But he threw away the candy and ate the rapper
Chewed him up (*ptt*), and spitted him out
Girl, giddy-up, now get-get down
He's lookin' around this club
And it looks like people are havin' a shit-fit now
Yeah, little tr-tr-trailer trash, take a look who's back in t-t-town
Did I st-st-stutter, motherfucker?
Fuck the mall, he shuts the whole motherfuckin' Walmart
D-d-down every time he comes a r-r-round
And he came to the club tonight with 5'9"" to hold this bitch down
Like a motherfuckin' chick underwater he's tryin' to dr-dr-drown
Shorty, when you dance, you got me captivated
Just by the way that you keep lickin' them dick-suckin' lips
I'm agitated, aggravated
To the point you don't suck my dick
Then you're gonna get decapitated
Other words, you don't fuckin' give me head
Then I'ma have to take it

[Verse 5: Royce Da 5'9""]
And then after takin' that I'ma catch a case, it's gon' be fascinatin'
It's gon' say the whole rap game passed away
On top of the affidavit
Graduated from master debater, slash massive masturbator
To Michael Jackson's activator (Woo)
Meanin' I'm on fire, off the top, might wanna back up data
Rollin' over hip-hop in a verbal tractor trailer
Homie, they're sick, you could normally ask a hater
Don't it make sense?
That these shell casings is just like a bag of paper
Dropped in the lap of a tax evader, homie, they spent

[Verse 6: Eminem]
Now make that ass drop like a sack of potatoes
What, girl? I'm the crack-a-lator
Percolator of this party, be my penis ejaculator later
Tell your boyfriend that you just struck paydirt
You're rollin' with a player
You won't be exaggeratin' when you say you're livin'

I hear the ""Tears of a Clown,"" uh, I hate that song
I always feel like they're talking to me, when it comes on (come on)
Another day, another dawn
Another Keisha, nice to meet ya, get the math, I'm gone
What am I supposed to do when the club lights come on?
It's easy to be Puff but it's harder to be Sean
What if my twins ask why I ain't marry their mom?
Damn, how do I respond?
What if my son stares with a face like my own
And says he wants to be like me when he's grown?
Shit! But I ain't finished growing

“A House Is Not a Home,” I hate this song
Is a house really a home when your loved ones is gone?
And niggas got the nerve to blame you for it
And you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it
But you felt it, and still feel it
And money can't make up for it or conceal it
But you deal with it (Deal with it), and you keep ballin'
Pour out some liquor, playboy, and we keep ballin' (Ballin')
Baby, we been living in sin
Cause we been really in love, but we been living as friends
So you've been a guest in your own home
It's time to make your house your home
Pick up your phone, come on

“Ain’t No Stopping Us Now,” I love that song
Whenever it comes on, it makes me feel strong
I thought I told y'all that we won't stop
Til we back cruisin through Harlem, these old blocks
It's what made me, saved me, drove me crazy
Drove me away, then embraced me
Forgave me for all of my shortcomings
Welcome to my homecoming
Yeah, it's been a long time coming
Lot of fights, lot of scars, lot of bottles
Lot of cars, lot of ups, lot of downs
Made it back, lost my dog (I miss you Big!)
But here I stand (Here I stand), a better man (Don't stop)
Thank you, Lord! Thank you all!

The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money
Paper chasin', tell that paper, ""Look, I'm right behind ya""
Bitch, real Gs move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong; pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell

[Verse 3: Cory Gunz]
Word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean
Get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gun, Son of Sam, you nigga's the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these niggas out they mind
I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep them bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love
Keep throwin' my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side
‘Cause ain't no peace on my side, bitch

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar & Kanye West]
Hey, baby, you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray-tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-Man
She remember my Sprinter, said ""I was in the grape van""
Uhm—well, cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come, Erykah Badu-me—well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said baby, ""Spin that 'round and say the alphabet backwards""
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just 'cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good, though; the head still good, though
Make me say ""Nam Myoho Renge Kyo""
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual, make me believe in miracles
Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kickin' in gratuity
And yeah, G, I was all for it
She said, ""K-Lamar, you kinda dumb to be a poet""
I'ma put you on game for the lames that don't know they a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Scary, scary
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A.

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Friday night, tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat—somethin' pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second-class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury tastebuds
And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A-list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only got hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preaching to the choir
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky'd and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowin' the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em, really
I remember Amber told my boy
No matter what happens, she ain't goin' back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive need to put up some goddamn barricades
I be paranoid every time, the pressure
The problem ain't I be drivin', the problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby 'Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans, I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over; emcees, cancel your plans
A 38-year-old 8-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took six months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
Goddamn! Got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressin' like Cam
Thank God for me! (Los Angeles)
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neckful
Bitches say he fun-ny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop, like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money (Money, money, money)!
Big, big money (Money, money, money!)
And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker!

I walked across an empty land
I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
I felt the earth beneath my feet
Sat by the river, and it made me complete

Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

I came across a fallen tree
I felt the branches of it looking at me
Is this the place we used to love?
Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?

I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
So tell me when you're gonna let me in

Talk about it somewhere only we know?
This could be the end of everything

We were sitting up there on your momma's roof
Talking 'bout everything under the moon
With the smell of honeysuckle and your perfume
All I could think about was my next move

[Verse 2: Keifer]
Oh but you were so shy, so was I
Maybe that's why it was so hard to believe
When you smiled and said to me

[Chorus: Keifer & Shawna]
Are you gonna kiss me or not?
Are we gonna do this or what?
I think you know I like you a lot
But you're about to miss your shot
Are you gonna kiss me or what?

[Verse 3: Keifer]
It was the best dang kiss that I ever had
Except for that long one after that
And I knew if I wanted this thing to last
Sooner or later I'd have to ask for your hand

[Verse 4: Keifer]
So I took a chance
Bought a wedding band and I got down on one knee
And you smiled and said to me

[Chorus: Keifer & Shawna]
Are you gonna kiss me or not?
Are we gonna do this or what?
I think you know I love you a lot
I think we've got a real good shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

[Verse 5]
[Keifer & Shawna]
So we planned it all out for the middle of June
From the wedding cake to the honeymoon
[Keifer]
And your momma cried
When you walked down the aisle

[Verse 6]
[Keifer & Shawna]
When the preacher man said, ""Say I do""
I did and you did too
[Keifer]
Then I lifted that veil
And saw your pretty smile and I said
Are you gonna kiss me or not?

Look at all the love that we got

414,Time After Time,"[Verse 1]
Lying in my bed, I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights almost left behind
Suitcase of memories, time after—
Sometimes you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
Then you say, ""Go slow.""
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

[Chorus]
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting (I will be waiting)
Time after time

[Verse 2]
After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting

Trying hard to fight these tears
I'm crazy worried
Messing with my head this fear
I'm so sorry
You know you gotta get it out
I can't take it
That's what being friends' about

[Verse 1: Bridgit Mendler]
I, I wanna cry
I can't deny
Tonight I wanna up and hide
And get inside
It isn't right
I gotta live in my life
I know I, I know I
I know I gotta do it
I know I, I know I
I know I gotta do it

[Chorus: Bridgit Mendler]
Gotta turn the world into your dance floor

Push until you can't and then demand more
Determinate, d-determinate
You and me together, we can make it better
Gotta turn the world into your dance floor
Determinate, d-determinate

Hate to feel this way
And waste a day
I gotta get myself on stage
I shouldn't wait
Or be afraid
The chips will fall where they may
I know I, I know I
I know I gotta do it
I know I, I know I
I know I gotta do it

Gotta turn the world into your dance floor

Okay, it's Wen and I'm heaven-sent, music like a veteran
Renegade, lemonade, use it in my medicine
Go ahead and try to name a band we ain't better than
Reason why the whole world's picking us instead of them
People need a breather 'cause they're feeling that adrenaline
Stop! Now hurry up and let us in
Knock! 'Cause we're coming to your house and
People keep on smiling like there lemons in their mouths
I'm the real deal, you know how I feel
Why they're in it for a bill, I'm just in it for the thrill
Get down now I ain't playin' around
Put your feet up on the ground and just make that sound like

Gotta turn the world into your dance floor

416,As If We Never Said Goodbye,"[KURT]
I don't know why I'm frightened: I know my way around here
The cardboard trees, the painted seas, the sound here...
Yes, a world to rediscover
But I'm not in any hurry
And I need a moment

The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways
The atmosphere, as thrilling here as always
Feel the early morning madness
Feel the magic in the making
Why, everything's as if we never said goodbye

I've spent so many mornings just trying to resist you
I'm trembling now, you can't know how I've missed you
Missed the fairy tale adventure
In this ever-spinning playground
We were young together

I'm coming out of make-up, the lights already burning
Not long until the cameras will start turning...
And the early morning madness
And the magic in the making
Yes, everything's as if we never said goodbye

I don't want to be alone, that's all in the past
This world's waited long enough: I've come home at last!

And this time will be bigger and brighter than we knew it
So watch me fly, we all know I can do it...
Could I stop my hands from shaking?
Has there ever been a moment
With so much to live for?

The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways
So much to say, not just today, but always...
We'll have early morning madness
We'll have magic in the making
Yes, everything's as if we never said goodbye
Yes, everything's as if we never said goodbye...

Just watching my cutiepie get beautified
Make me want better jewels, a newer ride
Louboutin shoes, she got too much pride
Her feet are killing her, I call it shoe-icide
Looking good has it's sacrifices
Chilly weather bring four figure jacket prices

Give you that iPhone 4, face time

Enough class for wine, still handle Patron

Keep it clean cut like bald heads

So you gotta ball harder than them ball players
All she wanna know is there a mall near us
Can't fault her, the last nigga spoiled her
But he ain't beat it up, I assault her
Shoulda seen her come to me when I called her
Slow strut like she walking to the altar
Hand bag on her arm cost four bills
And she ain't gotta beg, borrow or steal
Often imitated, never duplicated
They say she a dime, I say she underrated
I just met her so the next solution

And his arms a little bit longer than me

Like Luke with the force, if push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water for blood, let's go

And while I’m out here, I might as well go shopping
And put this new bad bitch I got in some red bottoms
And all these hatin’ ass niggas want me dead
Cause I’m Malcolm X before he turned Muslim, Red

Now Blood the fuck up
Every day’s a gamble muthafucka tough luck
And we gon' fuck the world 'til that bitch bust nuts
I can’t tell you what's good, but I can tell you what's what
And that’s, B’s up, hoes down
Lookin’ in the mirror, I’m nowhere to be found

And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?

""Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?""
""I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writin' a song, this song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself""
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

[Verse 2]
I keep havin' this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screamin' she don't want me to sing
""You're makin' Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?""
""Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more"" ""Daddy, you're lyin'!
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leavin' no more, Daddy, you're mine!""
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door, tryna block it
""Daddy, please! Daddy, don't leave! Daddy, no, stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it with ya!""
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man, I can hear 'em
They're sayin', ""You got one more chance to do right and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late!""
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and this spotlight is on and I'm singin'

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

[Verse 3]
Sixty-thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow, and thank you all for comin' out
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
""Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!""
But baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
""I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin
I get the point, fine, me and Mommy are goin'.""
But baby, wait! – ""It's too late, Dad, you made the choice
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep
Screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah, I bet you you will
You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real.""
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream, ""Die, Shady!"" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was
Supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles, and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

Easy money
It's about to be a surgical summer
Chop the tops off the coupes

The Spider joint
And you know we gotta cut the heads off these snakes, right?
Watch the body drop

[Verse]
Drug dealin' aside, ghostwritin' aside
Let's have a heart-to-heart about your pride
Even though you're multi, I see that your soul don't look alive
The M's count different when Baby divides the pie, wait
Let's examine why
Your music for the past few years been angry and full of lies
I'll start it at the home front, ""I'm On One""
Dennis Graham stay off the 'Gram, bitch, I'm on one
You mention wedding ring like it's a bad thing
Your father walked away at five—hell of a dad thing
Marriage is somethin' that Sandi never had, Drake
How you a winner but she keep comin' in last place?
Monkey-suit Dennis, you parade him
A Steve Harvey-suit nigga made him
Confused, always felt you weren't Black enough
Afraid to grow it 'cause your 'fro wouldn't nap enough
Since you name-dropped my fiancée
Let 'em know who you chose as your Beyoncé
Sophie knows better as your baby mother
Cleaned her up for IG, but the stench is on her
A baby's involved, it's deeper than rap
We talkin' character, let me keep with the facts
You are hiding a child, let that boy come home
Deadbeat mothafucka playin' border patrol, ooh
Adonis is your son
And he deserves more than an Adidas press run; that's real
Love that baby, respect that girl
Forget she's a pornstar, let her be your world, yuugh!
How dare you put Ye in my verses?
I'm selfish, I want all of the curses
I'm pre-bookin' the churches, me versus three hearses
If we all go to Hell, it'll be worth it
Already aligned with the greats, and on that same note
The only ones I chase are two ghosts
Still givin' you classics, that's the only thing that dates me
OVO 40, hunched over like he 80—tick, tick, tick
How much time he got? That man is sick, sick, sick
I got the devil flow, nigga—six-six-six
Surgical summer with it—snip, snip, snip
And you don't really want it with him

And telling folks Jesus is the answer can rub them wrong
It is not hip to sing about tractors, trucks, little towns, and mama, yeah that might be true
But this is country music and we do

[Verse 2]
Do you like to drink a cold one on the weekend and get a little loud

To shove it next time he yells at you?
Well this is country music and we do

Crying as she tells you that your brother is not coming home?
And if there's anyone that still has pride and the memory of those
That died defending the old red, white, and blue

So turn it on, turn it up, and sing along
This is real; this is your life in a song

You see how I did it, but that's history
You get a million dollar kiss from me
You a diamond, every other bad bitch in this world is more just like a six to me
So come and be rich with me, ride on a Six with me
I run through a hundred pack with you just to let you know that I'm with you

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR + Lil Yachty]
I still run through a hundred pack with you baby

453,From A Table Away,"I bet you'd never guess who I saw tonight
Guess you didn't see me in those low dim lights
I knew who she was
By the ring still on her hand
Sure looked like you still wanted to be her man

So I guess that means that things are better
Must not be so bad at home
I thought it looked like you were leavin'
But it don't
And I heard you tell her you still love her
So it doesn't matter what you say
I saw it all
From a table away

I thought she was pretty
She's nothing like the things you said
The woman you described
Couldn't even turn your head
The two of you look lost
Inside a world all your own
Like you couldn't wait to get her alone

So I guess that means that things are better
Must not be so bad at home
I thought it looked like you were leavin'
But it don't
And I heard you tell her you still love her
So it doesn't matter what you say
I saw it all

La di da we gotta protest that

Cause of you whinin bout him rubbin his nipple
Religious? Shit, you helped them bands
Instead of helpin them poor people
Eatin outta them garbage cans
When your done with that bitch come protest me
Shiiiiit motherf**ka I could use the money
The whole world was cryin when Kurt went kabang
When Eazy-E died no it wasn't no thang
Rapper dies of AIDS but you hardly mention
Rocker blows his face off and becomes a legend
Heroin and a shot gun and a hero was made
Maybe I should do that shit so J can get paid

If I was your tv I'd be like, look at me
If I was shooting star I be like shooooom
If I was a fat bitches thong I'd be like hell nah

If I was Alyssa Milano I'd be f**king Joe Bruce
If I was a radio DJ I'd probably say, point 103
If I was a richie ass bitch I'd be like, um ok
If I was Spin magazine I'd put a mirror on the cover
And be like f**k us and all our readers, even this motherf**ker
If I was your mental stress I'd be catching up
If I was your headaches every now and then
I'd be like thuuummmp
If I was your tounge I'd be hatin' your teeth I'd be like
Ah why do you always bite me every time we eat?
If I was a chair I'd be like sit here
And if I was Kid Rock I'd cut my feathered wolf hair
If I was your muffler I'd be like shhh quietly

Hey Mike, Mike, MIKE!
Turn it up, right about now

Let's see, hmm, well, I'd have to think about it
I might show up in a tux, HA!, but I doubt it
I'd probably just show up naked like I always do
And lick your momma in the eye and tell her, ""F**K YOU!!!""
Hurry up bitch, I'm hungry, I smell spaghetti
I'd pinch her loopy ass and tell her, ""Get the food ready!""
Your dad will probably start tripping and get me pissed
I'd have to walk up and bust him in his f**king lips!
It's dinner time, we hearing grace from your mother
I pull a forty out and pour some for your little brother
I'm steady staring at your sister, I'll tell you this
You know for only thirteen, she got some big tits
After that, your dad will try to jump again
And only this time, I'd put the forty to his chin
After you mom does the dishes and the silverware
I'd try f**k her till I nut in my underwear

The second little piggy, his house is made of brick
And this little piggy is a motherf**king dick
He sits on his bench and get's all the respect
But if I get a chance, I'm going straight for the neck
He walked in the room, and everybody rose
Lopped off bucket chilling underneath my clothes
First they let the piggy, now you can finally sit
But what this piggy don't know
Is he's about to get his neck wet
Now I seen the bailiff, I'm thinking what the f**k?
I can smoke this room before his hearing aid
Will pick it up
Old-ass man, I let him get away
That tired motherf**ker will probably die tomorrow anyway
Here come the piggy, it's time for my case
His eyes are blood red with a wicked looking face
He saw my joker's smile, and sentenced me to die
So I racked on the bucket, made it f**king rain pork rinds

(Chorus)
Three little piggies to make that piggy pie
There's nothing like the sound when you hear a piggy die
I might choose a gun (no!)
I might choose an ax (yes!)
The Carnival's in town, come and get your piggy snacks

My axe is my buddy, I bring him when I walk
Me and my axe will leave your head outlined in chalk
My axe is my buddy, he always makes me laugh
Me and my axe cut bigot spinal cords in half
My axe is my buddy, and when I wind him back
Me and my axe will give your forehead a buttcrack
My axe is my buddy, I never leave without him
Me and my axe will leave your neck a bloody fountain

(Chorus 2x)
Everybody everybody everybody run
Murdering murdering murdering fun
Swing swing swing
Chop chop chop
Swing swing swing

My axe is my buddy, he never makes me cry
Me and my axe will leave a divot for your eye",Insane Clown Posse,2011,[97],1

Shake me down, not a lot of people left around
Who knows now? Softly laying on the ground
Oooh not a lot of people left around oooh oooh

In my life I have seen people walk into the sea
Just to find memories plagued by constant misery
Their eyes cast down, fixed upon the ground
Their eyes cast down

Shake me down, cut my head on a silver cloud
Broken sound, softly laying on the ground
Oooh not a lot of people left around oooh oooh

In my past, bittersweet, there's no love between the sheets
Taste the blood, broken dreams, lonely times in deed
With eyes cast down, fixed upon the ground, with eyes cast down

[Chorus 2]
I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun
Turn back now, it's time for me to let go
Way down, had to find a place to lay low
Lamp shade, turned around into a light post

Walk around the corner, never saw it coming, still
I try to make a move it almost stopped me from belief

I'm just broken

Hold me up, underneath
This heavy burden

Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone

Tied up to a heart of stone

I burned the bridge, so I won't find my way home

When I'm broken

Fifteen times a night, when the sun's gone down
In the dark awake, and you're not around
And the closest thought is the edge of oblivion
Fifteen times a day when you check your phone
And I won't be there and you're all alone
'Cause we always lived on the edge of oblivion
Left to find our way through a Hitchcock film
In an empty bed with an hour to kill
'Cause it's only fun on the edge of oblivion (oblivion)

Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow

460,Who Are You When I'm Not Looking,"[Verse 1]
My oh my, you're so good-looking
Hold yourself together like a pair of bookends
But I've not tasted all your cooking
Who are you when I'm not looking?

Do you pour a little something on the rocks?
Slide down the hallway in your socks?
When you undress, do you leave a path?
Then sink to your nose in a bubble bath?

My oh my, you're so good-looking
Hold yourself together like a pair of bookends
But I've not tasted all your cooking
Who are you when I'm not looking?

I want to know
I want to know

[Verse 2]
Do you break things when you get mad?
Eat a box of chocolates cause you're feeling bad?
Do you paint your toes cause you bite your nails?
Call up mamma when all else fails?

Who are you when I'm not around?
When the door is locked and the shades are down?
Do you listen to your music quietly?
And when it feels just right, are you thinking of me?

Baby, you're not her

Next thing you know, we all on Jerry Springer
I play love games, but no, I'm not a cheater
She hate it when I sip codeine, I'm a leaner
The devil on my shoulder keep on telling me to keep her
Should I take her out or should I take her to the cleaner?
Love don't end good for me, no good for me
She's good for me, too good

I told her, ""Run around and get away""
I think I need a getaway
I need to call a timeout, I need to set another play
I need a umbrella 'cause every day feel like a rainy day
I need something other than Xannies to take the pain away
I ran away to California, I'm tryna cut corners
Satan bossin' me around, but you know I don't take orders
Yeah, I had to move around, I was startin' to feel cornered
Startin' to feel cornered, I can't see the front door
Startin' to feel cornered, startin' to feel slaughtered
Started to not give a fuck, screamin' out, ""Why bother?""

I'm going out with someone too
I won't feel sorry for me, I'm getting drunk
But I'd much rather be somewhere with you

Laughing loud on a carnival ride, yeah

You made fun of me for singing my song

I won't sit outside your house
And wait for the lights to go out
Call up an ex to rescue me, climb in their bed
When I'd much rather sleep somewhere with you

Like we did on the beach last summer
When the rain came down and we took cover
Down in your car, out by the pier
You laid me down, whispered in my ear

I hate my life, hold on to me
Ah, if you ever decide to leave
Then I'll go, I'll go, I'll go

[Chorus 3]
I can go out every night of the week
Can go home with anybody I meet
But it's just a temporary high cause when I close my eyes
I'm somewhere with you, somewhere with you

If you see me out on the town
And it looks like I'm burning it down
You won't ask and I won't say
But in my heart I'm always somewhere with you

Laughing loud on a carnival ride, yeah
Driving around on a Saturday night
You made fun of me for singing my song

Said her name was a hand me down name
From the side of a family that long ago came
Over here on a boat from somewhere in Spain
Sounded to me just a little bit strange, I guess
But I have to admit, it felt good on my lips

[Verse 2]
She tipped the DJ to play her favorite song
A Spanish little number that was a rocking on strong
She grabbed me by the sleeve and said, ""Let's go and get it on""
By the second chorus I was singing right along with it
I don’t know what it meant but it felt good on my lips

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh oh oh I, I wanna go crazy
You can go crazy too
Oh oh oh I, I wanna go crazy
I wanna go crazy with you

Everybody saying whoa how sweet it is
Whoa yeah it felt good on my lips

[Verse 3]
She ordered us a drink, it was a purple kind of pink
She said it’s got a shot of a little bit of everything
Mellow yellow umbrella for a fella like me
It was just a bit mellow for me to be seen with

In a little corner booth, eye to eye no talk
She leaned in close and gave me one long
And wet Goodnight goodbye kiss and It felt good on my lips

[Chorus]
Voices in my head sayin' I could do better, damn
Voices in my head sayin' that I knew better
(You know better, what the fuck!)
I done seen this shit happen a hundred times on the regular
But I still crossed the line like I'm blind, damn
Voices in my head saying I could do better
(You always do the same shit)

[Verse]
This was supposed to be the last time, last hit
Last call, last feel, last trip, last run
That's what I always tell myself, huh, damn
This was supposed to be the last one, last two
Last flip, last you, last me, last night
Doing every single thing my parents warned me 'bout
(You're a fucking disappointment) 'Til I wore 'em out, shit

[Chorus]
Voices in my head saying I could do better
(Voices in my head saying that I could do better)
Voices in my head saying that I knew better

I done seen this shit happen a hundred times on the regular
But I still, fuck

Part 2: ""Stick to the Plan""

[Bridge]
Voices in my head, conscience talking to me like
Look

Stick to the plan, stick to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan, to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan

[Verse 1]
Stay focused
Don't let these niggas see your emotions
Stick to the notion, stay in motion
Remember soon as you stand still
So will everything else you notice
Make sure all your inner actions end with actions
If you stacking fronting and back in
Subtract if it isn't adding
Plus who hurt you don't let back in
Plan it out, yeah, tit for tat it
Extra pussy get distracted
Put that into what's worth having (boy)

Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan, to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing

[Verse 2]
Stay focused (stay focused)
Pay attention who you getting close with
Distance yourself from negative energy
Voices in my head, they say it's meant for me
I, I, I, you in my way, bitch it's no sympathy
I, I, I, been plotting this since elementary
I, I, I, no you need to buckle down
Have people asking where you at
And wondering why you never wanna come around
You know that effort gon' come around
Big face like Zordon
You bought the watch but can't afford the time
Even if you running out of breath
Weight of the world doing lots of reps
Time to get this generation
Last one and then the next two outta debt
And they gon' pay you back with respect
Just stick to the plan, still, we can chill
Back when I rocked the white and blue Grant Hills
I realized there's no dream that I can't fill
I manifested all while I'm the man still
(Bitch I'm the man)

[Verse 3]
Voices in my head attacking what I'm thinking
Bullet to the head might be the way to free it
If I leave my body I can free the spirits
Swear to God my death of fear just keep on shrinking
Wishing I could go back to the nineties
Back when I was dreaming
Me and my dog was on a mission like we Kel and Kenan
Early 2000s Detroit might as well been the hell with demons
Wondering when I started losing it, the losing grip
Feeling like I'm in the middle of the ocean
You either drown or canoe through it
Voices in my head said I'm used to it
Some help me to lose and some help me maneuv' through it
When I talk to myself I'm confused on who's who it
I know in life you either blow it or blew it
And at the end of life, it's gonna feel like you flew through it
I just hope by then I cut the voices in my head",Big Sean,2011,"[97, 79, 66, 60, 59, 67, 57, 53, 55, 60, 64, 68, 80, 63]",14

467,Back To December,"Ali Eleot - Back To December



I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while

You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up, and I know why

Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time

It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed, and I didn't call

Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall

And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time

It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry

Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right

I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

This is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December

It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time, all the time",Ali Eleot,2011,"[37, 32, 29, 24, 24, 20, 18, 22, 26, 25, 25, 27, 26]",13

470,Waiting For The End,"[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot rocking every revision
But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
And though the words sound steady
Something empty's within them

We say yeah, with fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there
'Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear
Until we dead it, forget it, let it all disappear

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Waiting for the end to come
Wishing I had strength to stand
This is not what I had planned
It's out of my control

Flying at the speed of light
Thoughts were spinning in my head
So many things were left unsaid
It's hard to let you go

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I know what it takes to move on
I know how it feels to lie
All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Sitting in an empty room
Trying to forget the past
This was never meant to last
I wish it wasn't so

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I know what it takes to move on
I know how it feels to lie
All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
What was left when that fire was gone?
I thought it felt right, but that right was wrong
All caught up in the eye of the storm
And trying to figure out what it's like moving on

And I don't even know what kind of things I said
My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead
So, I'm picking up the pieces now, where to begin
The hardest part of ending is starting again

[Outro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

This is not the end, this is not the beginning

But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
Though the words sound steady

We say yeah, with fists flying up in the air

Sometimes living in a world like this
It's pretty hard not to go insane
Not pretty if you don't comply
Pretty easy if you don't complain
Stand there like you don't feel pain
No tears in the face of defeat
Pretend til the end that you don't fear change
Don't admit that your faith is weak
Don't say that you feel like dying
Life's hard then it feels like diamonds
Your home's just far too gone
Much too late to even feel like trying
Can't understand what I'm saying
Can't figure out what I'm implying
If you feel you don't wanna be alive
You feel just how I am
I'm on the dark side

I wanna stop these nightmares

All I see is all my flaws
All I hear is all my demons
Even through your applause
All you see is all my flights
Well all I see is all my falls
All you see is all my rights
All I see is all my wrongs

Gun on my table telling me to come on
Telling me to to put him inside my hand
Then put it up right next to my dome
Door keep telling me to find a reason
Anything to keep me from squeezing

You really like music, you really like reading
Love! I can't win if it's me against me

Two weeks she'll be yelling ""Fuck me""
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie
And Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me
Put Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me
Oh, generation above me, I know you still remember me
My afro look just like daddy's, y'all taught me how to go hunting, blam

God knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COINTEL
Check, checkmate, check me, take me to the bedroom
Like she know me well, I mean normally
You see Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil
But these kids these days, they get so high
Burn trees, smoke chlorophyll, 'til they can't feel shit
Shit-faced, faced it, 15 hits on this L
Elevated, train, and the craziest thing
Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill, miseducated, my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy, they said I shoulda never made it
Probably shoulda been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz
Asshole, absinthe, thumpin' that glass
Are we there yet? Ice cubes in a bong
Rip, brain-dead, take a tug and then pass

I ended up on an album cover in a Coogi
You see, I be still a God but a goofy
You be flowing about drugs and a Uzi
That's the dual principle, sometimes I'ma be about some hoes
Sometimes I'ma wanna make a movie
And when it come to rapping fast, I'm the Higgs Boson (Yeah)
And though my style freakish
I could still break your body down to five pieces like I did Voltron
'Cause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off a OG
Know me, I'm the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the dope, see (What?)
Never scared of mean spirits, methamphetamine lyrics
Cooler like I'm off of codeine, low key
Don't be so judgmental, even though I'm reminiscing
If I don't know what I miss is
I'ma end up figuring out that it's home
And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses
This is just a testament to the ones that raised me
The ones that I praise and I'm thanking
I need 'em but the chronic all up in my clothes
And I wanna get a hug, and I can't 'cause I'm stanking
Never too old for a spanking, IGH!

[Chorus 2: Vic Mensa]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my momma think I stank
I got burn holes in my memories, my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
I think we all addicted (Kisses, kisses)

[Chorus 1: Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

Hey, Ms. Red Carpet

477,Someone Else Calling You Baby,"[Verse 1]
I saw a truck backing out of your drive
You were sitting in the passenger side
Messing with the radio, you had your sun glasses on
I pulled over cause I couldn’t believe
Two weeks ago that was you and me
Riding down these old back roads, singing our songs
Now everybody round our town's been whispering
A tear in your eye says I should have been listening

[Chorus]
Baby is someone else calling you baby
It’s driving me crazy
This being in the dark
Goodbye aren’t never easy
So break it to me hard
If you’re over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don’t try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?

[Verse 2]
You wanted time and you wanted your space
So I backed off, did whatever it takes
Never really thought you were that ready for moving along
Now I aren’t leaving till I hear you say what’s going on
It’ll be what it will be, its either him or me
Give me the word and girl I’m gone

[Chorus]
Baby is someone else calling you baby
It’s driving me crazy
This being in the dark
Goodbye aren’t never easy
So break it to me hard
If you’re over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don’t try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?

[Outro]
No goodbye aren’t never easy
So break it to me hard
If you’re over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don’t try to save me

No, don’t try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?

What you think I'm on? Eyes low, I'm blown
High as a motherfucker, there ain't no question 'bout it

You think I'm pretty without any makeup on
You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me
So I let my walls come down, down
Before you met me
I was alright, but things were kinda heavy
You brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

[Chorus]
You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch
Now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

[Verse 2]
We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece
I'm complete

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

Let's run away and don't ever look back

So take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans

You sit there stone-faced, as if I'm not here
Can't you see that I've been crying?
I didn't know you'd be insane
Dreams can be so deceiving
You're an itch I can't reach, a wound that won't heal
The smell of skin that's burning
I didn't know you'd be insane
But it's true, and just say all I am to you is a

Pain in my neck, thorn in my side
Stain on my blade, blood on my knife
Been dreaming of her, all of my life
But she won't come true, she's just my nightmare I woke up to

She's twisted, he's a rebel, she's sick, he's hard to handle
But worst of all is she just don't care
She's twisted like a rope that is wrapped around her throat
But still worst of all is she (he) really don't give a—

Sometimes I wish that you would just die
Cause I'm too afraid of leaving
I didn't know you'd be insane
Dreams can be so deceiving

Why do I fantasize to kill you when you're sleeping?)
I didn't know you feel the same

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
Love ain't no fairytale, love is a buried nail
Inside of this heart of stone, so you wanna get married? Well
Romeo, Romeo—smokin' blow with Antonio
In a back-alley, takin' shots of whiskey and only gold
Juliet's at the nudie bar, doin' God only knows
Neither one of 'em came to see the dog and the pony show
But a bitch is a bitch, and a horse is a horse, ain't it?
Sorry, I can't afford to get your daddy's old Porsche painted
Sorry, Juliet that you embedded the sayin'
If a dollar makes you holler, well then I'm gettin' the short change of it
Uh, feel like I've been asleep and alone
And lovin' this angel, entangled between a dream and a coma
Walkin' the edge of this cliff, like a sheep to it's owner
Then woke up to this fuckin' bitch with an evil persona
Now if you say that you hate somebody and you livin' with them
Then they pack up and leave then you bitch about how you miss 'em
You gotta see the pattern of the blood all over the steerin' wheel
Love is a cannibal ridin' a carnival carousel
'Round and 'round we roll
Where it stops, baby nobody knows
Some people go crazy and they lose control
Some people jump off, some people won't let go
Some people say love, some people say why
Some people don't love, they just wanna free ride
The rain won't stop, it'll never dry
If she's in the house of pain then love is standin' outside
'Cause

She's twisted, he's a rebel, she's sick, he's hard to handle

485,Country Boy,"[Verse 1: Aaron Lewis]
Now I grew up down an old dirt road, in a town you wouldn't know
My pops picked the place up for fifteen hundred bucks, back in nineteen sixty-four
My grandfather was a drinker, back in the day he'd put 'em down
But a war is known to change a man, and the whiskey's known to change a man

[Chorus: Aaron Lewis]
But, that's not me
I rarely drink from the bottle, but I'll smoke a little weed
I still live in the sticks where you wouldn't go, in a town of twelve hundred off an old dirt road
And a country boy, is all I'll ever be

[Verse 2: Aaron Lewis & George Jones]
Now it's been twelve years since I sold my soul, to the devil in L.A
He said sign your name here on the dotted line, and your songs they all will play
He set up shop on Sunset, he put me up at the Marquee
He said, ""You wanna sell a million records, boy? You better listen to me""

[Bridge: Aaron Lewis & George Jones]
He said, ""Change your style, whiten your smile
You could lose a couple pounds
If you want to live this life, you'd better lose that wife
Do you need your friends around?""

[Chorus: Aaron Lewis]
I said, ""no that's not me""
'Cause the biggest things in life are your friends and family
And I like my jeans and my old t-shirts, and a couple extra pounds never really hurt
'Cause a country boy, is all I'll ever be

[Verse 2: Aaron Lewis]
'Cause Hank taught me just how to stay alive
You'll never catch me out the house without my nine or fourty-five
I've got a big orange tractor and a diesel truck, and my idea of heaven's chasin' white tail bucks
And as a country boy, I know I can survive

[Verse 3: Aaron Lewis]
Now two flags fly above my land, and really sum up how I feel
One is the colors that fly high and proud, the red, the white, the blue
The other one's got a rattlesnake, with a simple statement made
""Don't tread on me"" is what it says, and I'll take that to my grave

[Chorus: Aaron Lewis]
Because, this is me
I'm proud to be American and strong in my beliefs
And I've said it before, but I'll say it again, 'cause I've never needed government to hold my hand
And I've said it before, but I'll say it again, 'cause my family's always fought and died to save this land
And a country boy, is all I'll ever be

[Outro: Charlie Daniels]
I love my country, I love my guns, I love my family, I love the way it is now
And anybody that tries to change it, has to come through me
That should be all of our attitudes, 'cause this is America, and a country boy is good enough for me, son",Aaron Lewis,2011,"[87, 100]",2

I'm mind shocking, body rocking, earth shaking, money making
Sitting high, looking fly, drinking on the best wine

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Yo bitch I fucked your friend, yeah you stank ho
I seen her on the elevator, honey grabbed my Kangol
She put me on to mega-shit, bout to slap the bitch
She shot crazy verbal, I leaned back like I'm rich
It took place late night on February 17th
Hands flooded like ink, my face on her magazine
Just got back from Honolulu, pockets stacking beaucoup cash
Girlfriend sipped the Yoo-hoo and laughed, yo
While I was on tour, whore, you went to work
Quick fast, had a nigga dick in the dirt
You couldn't wait just to kidnap the bait of my sperm
Where was you at, ho? 'Pinky house, she put in my perm'
That's all you ever said to me, thought that could hold me
Remember when I long-dicked you and broke your ovary?
You crab bitch, chickenhead ho, eating heros
I'm the first nigga that had you watching flicks by DeNiro
You gained crazy points, baby, just being with God
Taught you how to eat the right foods, fast, and don't eat lard
I gave you earth lessons, I came to you as a blessing
You didn't do the knowledge what the God was manifesting
You sneaky fuck bitch, your ways and actions told it all
I fucked you while you was bleeding, held you down in malls
Sexually you worshipped my di-dick like a cross
I had you fiend out, broke out, for a month you fell off
You was my main shit, my peeps showed you love on the strength
You saw how I got down, the way I thought had you tranqued
But you had to fuck this lobster-head ass nigga
I shoulda slapped him but the Gods said chill
That's your wiz fault, god, handle that in the lab
I'm wondering how many times your hot ass got stabbed
You dumb bitch, horny hot fuck from out the mountains
Your clientele is low ho, catch you next show, bro
I got jerked, gave away my pussy, that shit hurt
It feel like somebody died or shot your old Earth
But fuck it, I fucked you on a chair with three legs
Broken tables, had you screaming while you was biting on my cables
We slid to the washing machine and threw it on spin
If your pussy dry, spit on my dick and put it in
My dick's the bomb baby, marvelous hot steak
Plus I'm conceited Starks make the biggest ho call rape
I'm God Cipher Divine, love my pussy refined
That means clean, a FDS smell with a shine
Word up, respect that ho",Ghostface Killah,2011,"[88, 84, 81, 81, 60, 85, 91, 98]",8
487,Pray,"[Verse 1]
I'm young and I'm foolish, I've made bad decisions
I block out the news, turn my back on religion
Don't have no degree, I'm somewhat naïve
I've made it this far on my own
But lately, that shit ain't been gettin' me higher
I lift up my head and the world is on fire
There's dread in my heart and fear in my bones
And I just don't know what to say

[Chorus]
Maybe I'll pray, pray
Maybe I'll pray
I have never believed in you, no
But I'm gonna pray

[Verse 2]
You won't find me in church (No)
Readin' the Bible (No)
I am still here and I'm still your disciple
I'm down on my knees, I'm beggin' you, please
I'm broken, alone, and afraid
I'm not a saint, I'm more of a sinner
I don't wanna lose, but I fear for the winners
When I try to explain, the words run away
That's why I am stood here today

[Chorus]
And I'm gonna pray (Lord), pray (Lord), maybe I'll pray
Pray for a glimmer of hope
Maybe I'll pray (Lord), pray (Lord), maybe I'll pray
I've never believed in you, no, but I'm gonna...

[Bridge]
Won't you call me?
Can we have a one-on-one, please?
Let's talk about freedom
Everyone prays in the end
Everyone prays in the end
Oh, won't you call me?
Can we have a one-on-one, please?
Let's talk about freedom

488,The Shape I'm In,"Go out yonder, peace in the valley
Come downtown, have to rumble in the alley
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in

Has anybody seen my lady
This livin' alone would drive me crazy
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in

I'm gonna go down by the water
But I ain't gonna jump in, no, no
I'll just be lookin' for my maker
And I hear that that's where she's been?

Oh out of nine lives, I spent seven
Now how in the world do you get to Heaven
Oh you don't know the shape I'm in

I've just spent 60 days in the jail house
For the crime of having no dough, no no
Now here I am back out on the street
For the crime of having nowhere to go

Save your neck or save your brother
Looks like it's one or the other
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in

Now two young kids might start a ruckus
You know they feel you're tryin' to shuck us
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in",The Band,2011,"[91, 98]",2

Sometimes
Oh, oh, oh
Something beautiful happens in this world
Akon
You don't know how to express yourself, so
And Lonely Island, yeah
You just gotta sing

[Chorus: Akon]
I just had sex, and it felt so good (Felt so good)
A woman let me put my penis inside of her
I just had sex, and I'll never go back (Never go back)
To the not-having-sex ways of the past

[Verse 1: Andy & Jorma]
Have you ever had sex? I have, it felt great
It felt so good when I did it with my penis
A girl let me do it, it literally just happened
Having sex can make a nice man out the meanest
Never guess where I just came from, I had sex
If I had to describe the feeling, it was the best
When I had the sex, man, my penis felt great
And I called my parents right after I was done
Oh, hey, didn't see you there, guess what I just did?
Had sex, undressed, saw her boobies and the rest
But sure nice of her to let you do that thing
Nice of any girl ever! Now, sing

[Chorus: Akon]
I just had sex, and it felt so good (Felt so good)
A woman let me put my penis inside of her
Wanna tell the world

[Verse 2: Andy & Jorma]
To be honest, I'm surprised she even wanted me to do it
Doesn't really make sense! But, man, screw it
I ain't one to argue with a good thing! She could be my wife
That good? The best thirty seconds of my life
I'm so humbled by a girl's ability to let me do her
'Cause honestly, I'd have sex with a pile of manure
With that in mind, a soft, nice-smelling girl's better
Plus, she let me wear my chain and my turtleneck sweater

[Bridge: Akon]
So this one's dedicated to them girls
That let us flop around on top of them, yeah
Whether you're near or far, whether short or tall, yeah
We wanna thank you all for letting us fuck you

[Interlude: Andy, Jorma, & Akon]
She kept looking at her watch
Doesn't matter, had sex
But I cried the whole time
Doesn't matter, had sex
I think she might've been a racist
Doesn't matter, had sex
She put a bag on my head
Still counts!

[Bridge: Akon]
I just had sex, and my dreams came true (Dreams came true)
So if you've had sex in the last thirty minutes
Then you qualified to sing with me

[Chorus: Akon]
I just had sex, and it felt so good (Felt so good)
A woman let me put my penis inside of her
I just had sex, and I'll never go back (Never go back)

But don't forget, it's me who put you where you are now
And I can put you back down too

Will she come back? No one knows

Number one spot, now she found her a replacement
I swear now I can't take it
Knowing somebody's got my baby
And now you ain't around, baby I can't think
I shoulda put it down, shoulda got that ring

My shorty, my wife

Didn't give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback
Now I'm in the club thinking all about my baby
Hey, she was so easy to love
But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough
I'm going through it every time that I'm alone
And now I'm missing, wishing she pick up the phone
But she made a decision that she wanted to move on

Grab the owl out the tree, and ask that bitch, who but me?
Got ya bitch bent over nigga, hands to her feet
Tell that pig and that cow I'll go ham if it's beef
Cause all my niggas well rounded
Don't fuck with none of these square niggas

Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten
Spot in the Caribbean by providence, impoverished, in squalor
Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?

[JOHN LAURENS]
The ten-dollar Founding Father without a father
Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
By being a lot smarter
By being a self-starter
By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a trading charter

[THOMAS JEFFERSON]
And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted
Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter

[JAMES MADISON]
Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain

[BURR]
Well, the word got around, they said, “This kid is insane, man”
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
“Get your education, don’t forget from whence you came, and
The world's gonna know your name. What’s your name, man?”

There would have been nothin’ left to do
For someone less astute
He woulda been dead or destitute
Without a cent of restitution

[Hook]
Raleigh be the city where we like to do the dance
Flex to the left throw some money out ya hands
We do it for the city, and
We do it for the fans
But to ball like Wall
Boy you gotta do the dance

Everybody do the John Wall, John Wall
John Wall, John Wall, John Wall, John Wall
John Wall, John Wall

[Verse 1: Breeze]
Everybody clear out, hand me the rock
Time winding down 3 seconds on the shot clock
Break the defense homeboy, I can't be stopped
All about my money so you know I'm hitting bank shots
I'm trying to tell them, boy you can't guard this
Beast on the court homeboy I play the hardest
Jump shot stupid; yeah it's retarded
You can't guard me in the paint I'm an artist
See I hustle on the floor call me Rick Ross
See the Troop get it jumping like a tip-off
I play hard until I hear the ref blow the whistle
I'm a player but my game be so official
Never reach got to stay out of foul trouble
But I drive in the lane, get them in foul trouble
They can't solve my game; I'm a hard puzzle
But I keep three dimes - that's a triple double

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Lil Inferno]
Sick with it
Hustle for the rock I go-go get it
I'm in it to win it, 919 baby we represent it
And I don't ball hog we got our whole team in it
See you just dribble but ain't ever got the heart to finish
Can't put me out the game I'm in that thing from start to finish
And if I can't drive the lane then best believe I'm about to dish it
Sideline drifting now, I'm gliding down the baseline
About to do a big slam catch me on them inches
Coming from the south side
The expectations of us is that we will not rise
And still we prove them wrong, we flexing cause we hot guys
Bring life to the game we will not die
Ha, yeah
Stand tall, yeah you call that the great Wall
All I do is ball I get up I can take a fall
I'm hungry for the top, call it lunchtime
Game winning shot, yeah it's clutch time

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Lil Lee]
(Let's do it)
Oh yeah we balling, balling until we falling
Until the last second I'm guessing we gone be brawling
Cause Kentucky here to win, not to watch you play
Whole world do the dance, say what up UK
Better take him out the game, cause they say that boy insane
When he coming down the lane, trying to catch a bang bang
First we flex, show the muscle then jigg on them
For the small play, let DeMarcus Cousins get big on them
You ain't handling nothing I'm about to catch a steal on them
Pass it to the point, crossover and I'm still on them
Crowd going bananas so you know that's why we peel on them
And we from the ""R"", ain't nothing like being real on them
Jump shot deadly, you know that we kill on them
Time to grab the money ball, about to shoot a bill on them
Yeah, North Cal. we gonna show them how to do it
Do the John Wall it ain't really nothing to it

Exotic red bottoms whole body glittered in gold
Following fundamentals and following in the rental
I love a nasty girl whose swallow is on the menu

I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned, bitches, what’s up witcha?
I hate callin’ the women bitches, but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I’m urgin’ all daughters to kiss they mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You’re never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls countin’ on me to be there like missin’ rubbers
I’m on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain’t the life that I’m used to
Reintroduced to people I’ve been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won’t remember
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I’m halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feelin’ like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don’t drink every bottle I own, I be agin’ shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engagin’ shit
Which one of y’all got fleets on your keychains?
The seats for these Heat games?
I really think you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I’ve been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don’t really fuck wit
Fuck is up?
Havin’ lunch and debatin’ Ferrari prices
23 and goin’ through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I’m not sayin’ I’m the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven’t hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I’ll never forget none of that
Girl, I told you I was coming back

God knows we're worth it
No, I won't give up

[Bridge]
I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
Our differences, they do a lot to teach us how to use the tools and gifts
We got yeah, we got a lot at stake
And in the end, you're still my friend, at least we did intend
For us to work, we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn, how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I got, and what I'm not
And who I am

[Chorus 2]
I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up
I'm still looking up

[Chorus 3]
Well, I won't give up on us
God knows I'm tough enough
We got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it (And we're worth it)

Even if the skies get rough

517,Put You In A Song,"[Verse 1]
Well here you come again and you're looking so fine
You don't notice me but it's alright
I'm just a guy who wishes that I could be your man someday
Yeah a picture paints a thousand words, it's true
But it's still not enough for how I feel about you
I want to put you in a melody, I got to set you into a groove

[Chorus 1]
I want to put you in my car and drive
And turn you up loud, roll down all the windows and shout it out
I love this girl oh
If I could press play, repeat how happy I'd be
Wherever I'd go I'd have you there with me
You'd be right where you belong
I want to put you in a song, oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
Well I'd sing about your smile and your pretty blue eyes
The way your hair shimmers in the sunlight
It'd be so easy, I'd just write it from my heart
Because I got to tell the world what you mean to me
Wrap you up in a melody so you'll be
Stuck in my head all day
Because you're already there anyway, yes you are

I want to put you in my car and drive

And when they see you on the street they'll say

518,She's Not There,"[Verse 1]
Well no one told me about her
The way she lied
Well no one told me about her
How many people cried

[Pre-Chorus]
But it's too late to say you're sorry
How would I know why should I care?
Please don't bother trying to find her
She's not there!

[Chorus]
Well let me tell you 'bout the way she looked
The way she'd acted, the color of her hair
Her voice was soft and cool
Her eyes were clear and bright
But she's not there

[Verse 2]
Well no one told me about her
What could I do?
Well no one told me about her
Though they all knew

[Pre-Chorus]
But it's too late to say you're sorry
How would I know, why should I care?
Please don't bother trying to find her
She's not there!

[Chorus]
Well let me tell you 'bout the way she looked

Her voice was soft and cool

519,Words I Never Said,"[Hook: Skylar Grey]
It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
I really think the War on Terror is a bunch of bullshit
Just a poor excuse for you to use up all your bullets
How much money does it take to really make a full clip?
9/11, building 7, did they really pull it?
Uh, And a bunch of other coverups
Your child's future was the first to go with budget cuts
If you think that hurts, then wait, here comes the uppercut
The school was garbage in the first place, that's on the up and up
Keep you at the bottom but tease you with the upper crust
You get it, then they move it, so you never keeping up enough
If you turn on TV, all you see's a bunch of ""what the fucks""
Dude is dating so and so, blabbering 'bout such and such
And that ain't Jersey Shore, homey, that's the news
And these the same people supposedly telling us the truth
Limbaugh is a racist, Glenn Beck is a racist
Gaza Strip was getting bombed, Obama didn’t say shit
That's why I ain't vote for him, next one either
I’m a part of the problem, my problem is I’m peaceful
And I believe in the people, yeah

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Now we can say it ain't our fault if we never heard it
But if we know better, then we probably deserve it
Jihad is not holy war, where's that in the worship?
Murdering is not Islam, and you are not observant
And you are not a Muslim
Israel don't take my side cause look how far you've pushed them
Walk with me into the ghetto, this where all the kush went
Complain about the liquor store, but what you drinking liquor for?
Complain about the gloom, but when'd you pick a broom up?
Just listening to Pac ain't gon' make it stop
A rebel in your thoughts ain't gon' make it halt
If you don't become an actor, you'll never be a factor
Pills with million side effects, take 'em when the pain's felt
Wash them down with diet soda, killing off your brain cells
Crooked banks around the world would gladly give a loan today
So if you ever miss a payment, they can take your home away

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
I think that all the silence is worse than all the violence
Fear is such a weak emotion, that's why I despise it
We scared of almost everything, afraid to even tell the truth
So scared of what you think of me, I'm scared of even telling you
Sometimes I'm like the only person I feel safe to tell it to
I'm locked inside a cell in me, I know that there's a jail in you
Consider this your bailing out, so take a breath, inhale a few
My screams is finally getting free, my thoughts is finally yelling through

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said",Lupe Fiasco,2011,[89],1

Lookin' freaky up at the legs, do you like that?
That, that. I'll be workin' your body like I be working the pictures in the portfolio
I don't know if it was a face, it was a hair, it was an ass, that made me want to put you up in the video

I'll be the director come and gimme a chair
Star quality I'll see if it's really in there

521,Make It Rain,"[Verse 1]
When the sins of my father
Weigh down in my soul
And the pain of my mother
Will not let me go
Well, I know there can come fire from the sky
To refine the purest of kings
And even though I know this fire brings me pain
Even so, and just the same

[Chorus]
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Make it rain

Well, a seed needs the water
'Fore it grows out of the ground
But it just keeps on getting hard
Hunger more profound
Well, I know they can't count tears from the eye
But they may as well all be in vain
And even though I know these tears come with pain
Even so, and just the same

[Chorus]
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Just make it rain
Make it rain

Well, the seas are full of water
Stops by the shore
It's like the riches of grandeur, oh no
Never reach the poor
And let the clouds fill with thunderous applause
And let lightning be the veins
But fill the sky with all that they can draw
When it's time to make a change

Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain

522,Rhythm of Love,"[Verse 1]
My head is stuck in the clouds
She begs me to come down
Says, ""Boy, quit foolin' around""
I told her, ""I love the view from up here
Warm sun and wind in my ear
We'll watch the world from above
As it turns to the rhythm of love""

[Chorus]
We may only have tonight
But 'til the morning sun, you're mine
All mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love

[Verse 2]
My heart beats like a drum
A guitar string to the strum
A beautiful song to be sung
She's got blue eyes deep like the sea
That roll back when she's laughing at me
She rises up like the tide
The moment her lips meet mine

[Chorus]
We may only have tonight
But 'til the morning sun, you're mine
All mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love

[Bridge]
When the moon is low
We can dance in slow motion
And all your tears will subside
All your tears will dry

Bop ba (bop ba) bop ba
Da da da dum da da dum

Bop ba (bop ba) bop ba
Bop ba (bop ba) bop ba
Da da da dum da da dum

And long after I've gone
You'll still be humming along
And I will keep you in my mind
The way you make love so fine

We may only have tonight
But 'til the morning sun, you're mine
All mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love

Oh, play the music low

Когда насквозь пронзит нас боль
Всё было ахуенно, так что не спорь
Останутся в памяти крапали
Следами, подозрительными в крови
Все те же байки из склепа трави
Тетрагидроканнабинол ,плюс херов серотонин
Пусть бьются бокалы, пусть бьются стопари
Пусть душа поёт, пусть душа болит
Когда гонишь по бездорожью стопани
Да братана на дело гиблое не стропали

О чём задумался, друг мой? Не грусти, не тухни
Тысячи лет будет мало, чтоб разобрать суть этой грёбаной кухни
Знаешь, так или иначе, любая стена по итогу здесь рухнет
Не жалею, не плачу и не коплю мысли, как пыльную рухлядь
Мы получим своё, все мы будем при семьях, и хатах, и бабках
За рулём быстрого немца, с уверенным взглядом, на новеньких тряпках
Моё сердце всё также стучит в быстром ритме единого такта
Не дай Бог нам ругани с баночкой пенного напротив телика в засранных тапках
Я прихлопну тоску, словно жирную муху
Я начислю кваску, на рассвете сгорают воскресные плюхи
Сам себе на уме, хотя реже теперь бываю не в духе
Но в нужный момент жизнь не отмотать назад, как кассету старой порнухи
Траблы, которые грузят, разрулятся сами собой
Пускай капризная муза, что где-то блуждала опять возвратится домой
И никаких оправданий, орём что есть силы, будто снова две тыщи шестой
Подниму голову к небу и солнцу скажу я: «Спасибо», пока молодой

[Припев: Hash Tag]
Пока молодой
Слышь, пока молодой
Пой, танцуй, пока молодой
Люби, ревнуй, пока молодой
Пока молодой
Друг мой, пока молодой
Пока молодой
Пой, пока молодой
Пока молодой

[Постприпев: Hash Tag]
В маленькой комнате, залитой солнечным светом
Опять тянет белой вдовой
Пусть летним вечером вновь моя музыка стелется
Будто туман над водой
Пока молодой
Пока молодой
Пока молодой
Пой, пока молодой
Пока молодой",HASH TAG,2011,[81],1
528,The Creep,"[Intro: Andy & John Waters]
Haha, yeah
Hi, I'm John Waters, and this is the Creep

[Hook: The Lonely Island]
When you’re out at a club and you see a fly girl
Do the Creep (ha)
Do the Creep (ha)
And if you wanna make friends at the ATM
Do the Creep (ha)
And do the Creep (ha)

[Verse 1: Andy & Akiva]
Well, we got a new dance, so get up on your feet
It’s real easy to do and it’s called the Creep
Let your hands flop around, like a marionette
Pop your knees up and down, sh-sh-shakin’ your neck
Now pull your waistband up like you expecting a flood
And stick your hair down flat like it was covered in mud
Trim up your pencil mustache and pop them peepers
Put this in your speakers, you a certified creeper

[Hook: The Lonely Island]
When you see a country peach laying out at the beach
Do the Creep (ha)
And do the Creep (ha)
And when a fine PYT walks in front of your tree
Do the Creep (ooh)
And do the Creep (ha)

[Verse 2: Andy & Akiva]
I was six years old when I started creeping
My parents took it to their room and I started peeping
You can imagine their surprise when they lifted their heads
And saw my little ass creeping at the foot of the bed
And they knew I was a creep since the day I was born
Get popping out my momma like some kettle corn
And the doctor caught my head and he starting freaking
Cause I came out clean and I came out creeping

[Interlude: The Lonely Island & Nicki Minaj]
Nicki (uh), Nicki (uh huh)
Nicki, Nicki, Nicki, Nicki (yeah)

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj & The Lonely Island]
When I was a girl, I creeped in the boys' locker room
Hide deep inside, it was my little creep stalker room
As they disrobed, I was oogling and oggling
Little did they know that for me, they were modeling
And I would laugh: ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
And they would dance: la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
So pop your peepers and squeak out your sneakers
Don’t sleep, come on, get your creep on with me

[Hook: The Lonely Island & Nicki Minaj]
Go on and get you sweating off the bride at her wedding
Do the Creep (ha)
And do the Creep (ha)
But when you sneak into a wake and you see a beefcake
Do the Creep (ooh)
And do the creep (ha)
When the judge is a hottie and you can’t control your body
Do the Creep (ha)
And do the Creep (ha)
So get your knees flexin’ and your arms T-Rexin’
And creep, haha (ha)
Do the Creep (ha)

And don’t forget to smile",The Lonely Island,2011,[82],1
529,Bullets In The Gun,"[Verse 1]
They used to call me lightning
I was always quick to strike
Had everything I own
In the saddles on my bike
I had a reputation
For never staying very long
Just like a wild and restless drifter
Like a cowboy in a song

[Verse 2]
I met a dark haired beauty
Where they lay the whiskey down
In southern Arizona
In a little border town
She had to dance for money
In that dusty old saloon
I dropped a dollar in the jukebox
Played that girl a tune, yea

[Chorus]
Never see it coming
It just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
That fire in her eyes
Makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table and
The bullets in the gun

[Verse 3]
She was sitting on my lap
We still had shots to kill
When a man pulled up
Who owned the bar
In a Cadillac DeVille
He grabbed her by her raven hair
And threw her on the floor
Said no free rides for the cowboys
That ain't what I pay you for, no

[Verse 4]
She jumped up and grabbed my pistol
Stuck it in the fat man's back
Said open up the safe
And put your money in the sack
Then tied his hands behind him
And put a blindfold on his eyes
Said if you're dumb enough to chase us, man
You're dumb enough to die

[Chorus]
Never see it coming
It just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
That fire in her eyes
Makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table and
The bullets in the gun, yeah

[Verse 5]
We rode across the border
Down into Mexico
When you're running from the law
Ain't that where everybody goes
We came to a town
With a name I could not spell
She gave me what I came for
In that Mexican motel

[Verse 6]
I woke up to sirens
And the sound of running feet
There were fifty Federales
Locked and loaded in the street
She grabbed my .44
I grabbed the money in the sack
She kissed me for the last time
And we headed out the back

[Bridge]
Every gun was on us
And every heartbeat pounded
There's only one thing left to do
When they got you all surrounded
She fired that old pistol
But we didn't stand a prayer
Money hit the gravel
Bullets filled the air

[Chorus]
Never see it coming
It just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
That fire in her eyes
Makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table and
The bullets in the gun
Bullets in the gun
Bullets in the gun

530,The Ballad Of Mona Lisa,"[Verse 1]
She paints her fingers with a close precision
He starts to notice empty bottles of gin
And takes a moment to assess the sin she's paid for
A lonely speaker in a conversation
Her words are swimming through his ears again
There's nothing wrong with just a taste of what you paid for

[Pre-Chorus]
Say what you mean, tell me I'm right
And let the sun rain down on me
Give me a sign, I want to believe

[Chorus]
Whoa, Mona Lisa
You're guaranteed to run this town
Whoa, Mona Lisa
I'd pay to see you frown

[Verse 2]
He senses something, call it desperation
Another dollar, another day
And if she had the proper words to say, she would tell him
But she'd have nothing left to sell him

Say what you mean, tell me I'm right
And let the sun rain down on me
Give me a sign, I want to believe

How do you do that shit?
How do you? How do you? How do you?
How do you? How do you?

[Verse 1]
You let me win, you let me ride
You let me rock, you let me slide
And when they lookin', you let me hide
Defend my honor, protect my pride
The good advice, I always hated
But lookin' back, it made me greater
You always told me, forget the haters
Just get my money, just get my weight up
Know when I'm lyin', know when I'm cryin'
It's like you got it, down to a science
Why am I tryin'? No, you ain't buyin'
I tried to fight it, back with defiance
You make me laugh, you make me hoarse
From yellin' at you, and gettin' at you
Pickin up dishes, throwin' them at you
Why are you speakin', when no one asked you?

What are we doin'? 'Cause you see through me
'Cause you say ""Nicki,"" and I say ""Who me?""
And you say ""No you,"" and I say ""Screw you""
Then you start dressin', and you start leavin'
And I start cryin', and I start screamin'
The heavy breathin', but what's the reason?
Always get the reaction you wanted
I'm actually frontin', I'm askin' you somethin - yo!
Answer this question, class is in session
Tired of lettin', passive aggression
Control my mind, capture my soul
Okay, you're right, just let it go
Okay, you got it, it's in the can
Before I played it, you knew my hand
You could turn a free throw to a goal
Nigga got the peephole to my soul

Flying Holly Grove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls are down to roll
I hit the strip club, and all them bitches find a pole
Plus I be sipping, so this shit is moving kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go

And if I knew it'd ends like this
I never would have kissed you 'cause I fell in love with you
We never would have kicked it, girl, now everything's different
I've lost my only lover and my friend

538,Smoke A Little Smoke,"[Instrumental]
[Verse 1]
Turn the quiet up, turn the noise down
Let this ol' world just spin around
I wanna feel it swing, wanna feel it sway
And put some feel good in my soul
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke

Want a little more right, and a little less left
Little more right now, a little less what's next
Act like tomorrow's ten years away
And just kick back and let the feelin' flow
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke

[Verse 2]
I set my sails for a new direction
But the wind got in my way
I changed my course
But my definition of change
Just ain't the same

I'm gonna sit right here
Stay away from there
I'm gonna make pretend
I just don't care
And I could get up
Go get her back
Or maybe I'll just let her go
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke
(ah come on now)
Go get her back (ohhh)
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke
Drink a little drink smoke a little, smoke
(You guys put your hands together like this)

[Bridge]
Kick back, gives the blues a spin
Break out the wine, forget again
Dig down deep, find my stash
Light it up, take me back

[Bridge]
Kick back, gives the blues a spin
Break out the wine, forget again
Dig down deep, find my stash
Light it up, memory crash

[Outro]
Oh no, I don’t know
Baby, it might take, all night
Then I’ll maybe break out that old rock and roll
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke

540,Help Is On The Way,"[Verse 1]
I have my mother's dreams, I have my father's eyes
You can't take that from me, just go ahead and try
The Crescent City sleeps, while giants in the sky
Preparing to unleash, let loose a mighty cry

Can nobody save us? Will anyone try?
The bayou is burning, the cypress has died
And all alone they're saying

[Hook]
Help is on the way (they said, they said)
Help is on the way (they said, they said)
One by land, two by sea, right there in front of me
Help is on the way

[Verse 2]
Five thousand feet below, as black smoke engulfs the sky
The ocean floor explodes, eleven mothers cry
My bones all resonate a burning lullaby
You can't take that from me, just go ahead and try

She stands at the shoreline with hands in the air
Her words pierce the dark night, ""does anyone care?""
And all alone they're saying

[Hook]
Help is on the way (they said, they said)
Help is on the way (they said, they said)
One by land, two by sea, right there in front of me
Help is on the way

[Bridge]
Right here, right here
Right here, right here
Right here, right here

[Verse 3]
Choking on the black gold, upon which we rely
We keep axes in the attics to see cameras in the sky
""Help is on the way"" they said, they said
""Help is on the way"" they said, they said
We were told just to sit tight
Cause somebody will soon arrive
""Help is on the way""

But it never came
It never came

[Hook]
Help is on the way (they said, they said)
Help is on the way (they said, they said)
One by land, two by sea, right there in front of me

I am not Jasmine, I am Aladdin
So far ahead, these bums is laggin'
See me in that new thing, bums is gaggin'
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin'
So fuck I look like gettin' back to a has-been?
Yeah, I said it, has-been
Hang it up; flatscreen
Plasma
""Hey Nicki, hey Nicki,"" asthma
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine
I got bars; sentencin'
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt
And I'll kick that ho; punt
Forced trauma; blunt
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front
You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with
You lil' brag-a-lot, I beat you with a pad-a-lock
I am a movie; camera block
You outta work, I know it's tough
But enough is enough

[Verse 2: Eminem as Slim Shady]
I ain't into S&M, but my whip's off the chain
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame
You don't like it, then peel off, bitch!
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off
And I still wouldn't fuck you, slut!
So wipe the smile on your grill off
I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turning, spin, and wheel off
Snap the axle in half, bust the tie-rod
Quit hollering ""Why, God?""
He ain't got shit to do with it
Bygones'll never be bygones
The world ain’t finished swallowing my wad
I ain't finished blowing it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch, life's hard
I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealing my music
So I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod!
The moral to the story is, life's treating you like dry sod?
Kick it back in its face, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
But don't ask why, bitch (Ask ""Why not?"")

[Hook: Eminem as Slim Shady]
The world-world is my punching bag and
If I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots
Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
Like a raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
You fell off, off, they musta bumped your wagon
You musta went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end
I told you to stay in your lane, you just jumped in traffic

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj as Roman Zolanski]
Is this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on?
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?
Shoulda sent a thank-you note, you little ho
Now I'ma wrap your coffin with a bow
""Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot""
Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot?
Well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
I hear them mumblin', I hear the cacklin'
I got 'em scared, shook, panickin'
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a standstill; mannequin
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my niggas gettin' buck; overbite
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's
Raggedy Ann, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why?
These bitches callin' me Manning Eli
Manning Eli, these bitches callin' me Manning Eli!!

[Verse 4: Eminem as Slim Shady]
All you lil' faggots can suck it
No homo, but I'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep acting as if
You had the same passion that I have, yeah, right
Still hungry, my ass, you ass-dicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids but eyelash
Go take a flying leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony
'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
You know what time it is, so why ask?
When Shady and Nicki's worlds clash
It's (High class) meets (White trash)

Love, love
Love, love, love
[Mumbling chorus]
Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me no more
Young Money, yeah
No more
Love

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne & Haddaway]
Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's ""Fuck the world,"" get a child out her
Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing 'bout her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers (no love)
I'm rollin' Sweets, I'm smokin' sour
Married to the game, but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my nightstands are full of open Bibles
Uh, I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire expectin' not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg
Money outweighin' problems on a triple beam
I'm stickin' to the script, you niggas skippin' scenes
Uh, be good or be good at it
Fuckin' right, I got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put a dick in they mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say
I'm high as a bitch, up, up and away
Man, I'll come down in a couple of days
Okay, you want me up in the cage?
Then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G code
It's Weezy, motherfucker, Blood gang, and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough, but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knockin', but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found

[Chorus: Eminem, Lil Wayne, Both, & (Haddaway)]
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (yeah)
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just don't (hurt me)
That's right, it don't (hurt me)
And I don't need you (no more)
Don't wanna see you (no more)
Ha, bitch, you get no (love)
You showed me nothing but hate (haha!)
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around (yeah)
And I don't need you (don't hurt me)
That's right, you don't (hurt me)
And I don't need you (no more)
Don't wanna see you
Ha, bitch, you get (no love)

Ha, bitch, you get (no love)
No! (No love) No! (No love)
And I don't need you (no more)
Get 'em!

[Verse 2: Eminem, Lil Wayne, & Both]
I'm alive again, more alive than I have been
In my whole entire life, I can (yeah)
See these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen
Uh, I'm a little bit sicker than most
Shit's finna get thick again, they say the competition is stiff
But I get a hard dick from this shit and I stick it in
I ain't never giving in again (yeah)
Caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers, how I treat 'em
So why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em? (yeah!)
They call me a freak, 'cause I like to
Spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em (haha)
Man, get these whack cocksuckers off stage!
Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him? (oh!)
Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch, I'ma let you finish in a minute
Yeah, that rap was tight, but I'm (yeah!)
'Bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and, um (yeah!)
Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit
And start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
From the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd (yeah)
You can see the sparks from hot metal (yeah)
Cold-hearted, from the day I Bogarted
The game, my soul started to rot, fellow (yeah)
When I'm not even in my harshest
You can still get roasted, ‘cause Marsh is not mellow
'Til I'm topplin' from the top, I'm not gonna stop
I'm standin' on my Monopoly board (uh)
That means I'm on top of my game
And it don't stop 'til my hip don't hop anymore (shit)
When you're so good that you can't say it
‘Cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore (shit)
People just get sick ‘cause you spit
These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore (ow!)
And you can never break my stride (nope)
You'll never slow the momentum at any moment
I'm 'bout to blow, you'll never take my pride
Killin' the flow, slow venom
And the opponent is gettin' no mercy, mark my words
Ain't lettin' up, relentless, I smell blood
I don't give a fuck, keep givin' them hell
Where was you when I fell and needed help up?
You get no love

[Chorus: Eminem, Lil Wayne, Both, & (Haddaway)]
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (uh)
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just don't (hurt me)
Yeah, that's right, it don't (hurt me)
And I don't need you (no more)
Don't wanna see you (no more)
Ha, bitch, you get no (love)
You showed me nothing but hate (yeah!)
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around
And I don't need you (don't hurt me)
That's right, you don't (hurt me)

Like some wide eyed dreamer
That just rolled in off a dusty mid west bus
Yeah, on the outside I look fragile
But on the inside is something you can't crush

Hard to break

In my mind, I'm running round a cold and empty space
Just put your arms around me, tell me everything's OK

Break my bones but you won't see me fall, oh

553,The Breath You Take,"[Verse 1]
He looks up from second base, dad's up in the stands
He saw the hit, the run, the slide, there ain't no bigger fan
In the parking lot after the game
He said, ""Dad, I thought you had a plane to catch?""
He smiled and said, ""Yeah, son, I did""

[Chorus]
But life's not the breath you take, the breathing in and out
That gets you through the day, ain't what it's all about
You just might miss the point trying to win the race
Life's not the breaths you take but the moments that take your breath away

[Verse 2]
Fast forward fifteen years and a thousand miles away
Boy's built a life, he's got a wife and a baby due today
He hears a voice saying, ""I made it son""
Says, ""I told you dad, you didn't have to come""
He smiles and says, ""Yeah, I know you did""

[Chorus]
But life's not the breath you take, the breathing in and out
That gets you through the day, ain't what it's all about
You just might miss the point trying to win the race
Life's not the breaths you take but the moments that take your breath away

[Bridge]
Just like it took my breath when she was born
Just like it took my breath away when dad took his last that morn

[Verse 3]
Life's not the breath you take, the breathing in and out
That gets you through the day, ain't what it's all about
Just might miss the point if you don't slow down the pace
Life's not the breaths you take but the moments that take your breath away",George Strait,2011,"[93, 74, 81, 92, 67]",5
554,Turn On The Radio,"[Verse 1]
No Good, two-timing, lies coming out of your mouth
Cheating, mistreating games that you play brought you down
Broke my heart, tore it apart, look who's got the last laugh now
Don't you come crawling back, begging please on your knees, baby if you're missing me

[Chorus 1]
Well, you can hear me on the radio
You want to turn me on, turn on your stereo
You can sing along, while they're playing our song
How you done me wrong, baby crank it up
Until you blow the speakers out your Chevy truck
So listen Romeo, when you're feeling kind of low
Let me tell you where to go
Turn On The Radio!

[Verse 2]
Try to call, twitter me, text until your fingers bleed
Oh! The DJ's the only way you're ever going to hear from me

Well, you can hear me on the radio
You want to turn me on, turn on your stereo
You can sing along, while they're playing our song

555,Stuck Like Glue,"[Verse 1]
MMMM better, MMMM better
Absolutely no one that knows me better
No one that can make me feel so good
How did we stay so long together?
When everybody, everybody said we never would
And just when I, I start to think they're right
That love has died

[Chorus]
There you go making my heart beat again
Heart beat again
Heart beat again
There you go making me feel like a kid

Some days I don't feel like trying
Some days you know I wanna just give up

You do that thing that makes me laugh
And just like that

556,Love The Way You Lie,"[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
Me, she fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait!
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No, you ain't!
Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie",Eminem,2011,"[46, 35, 35, 44]",4
557,My Kinda Party,"[Verse 1]
I worked all week
Cleaned up clean cut and clean shaved
I got the cover off the '68
I fire it up and let them horses sing
A little pretty thing
A little tan-legged Georgia dream
She’s a rocking them holey jeans
Baby what you got going on Saturday?
You know words got it there’s gonna be a party
Out of town about half a mile
Four wheel drives and big mud tires
Muscadine wine

[Chorus]
Oh baby you can find me
In the back of a jacked up tailgate
Sitting round watching all these pretty things
Get down in that Georgia clay
And I’ll find peace
At the bottom of a real tall cold drink
I'm chilling to some Skynyrd and some old Hank
Let's get this thing started
It’s my kinda party

[Verse 2]
If you wanna drink
Go baby just do your thing
Give up your keys
Hell why drive when you can stay with me?
And then after while we’ll sneak away from the bonfire
Walk by the moonlight and down to the riverside
Gotcha sipping on some moonshine
Baby if you're in the mood you can settle for a one night rodeo
You can be my tan-legged Juliet
I’ll be your Redneck Romeo

[Chorus]
Oh baby you can find me
In the back of a jacked up tailgate
Sitting round watching all these pretty things
Get down in that Georgia clay
And I’ll find peace
At the bottom of a real tall cold drink
I'm chilling to some Skynyrd and some old Hank
Let's get this thing started
It’s my kinda party

Oh baby you can find me

Are we gonna even make it? Oh

It's easier, can't you see? Let's agree to just disagree
We don't have to like each other, but it's sure fun to pretend

[Chorus]
So lets shake hands and reach across those party lines
You got your friends just like I got mine
We might think a little differently
But we got a lot in common, you will see
We're just like you, only prettier

[Verse 2]
Everybody says you gotta know your enemies
Even if they only weigh a hundred pounds and stand five foot three
If you just smile and behave, you could always get your way
It's a universal plan that'll get you where you can in all societies

[Chorus]
So lets shake hands and reach across those party lines
You got your friends just like I got mine
We might think a little differently
But we got a lot in common, you will see
We're just like you, only prettier
Hey

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
So lets shake hands and reach across those party lines
You got your friends just like I got mine
We might think a little differently
But we got a lot in common, you will see
We're just like you, only prettier

Get her out of me

Sorry for what I've become
Because I'm becoming someone
Your hand on my neck, you call up the press
Die for the attention
You pray for a reaction
I'll stop when it's no more fun
If this is the start, then let's see how far
You're gonna take this one

This isn't a fight to be won
Go on and give up the gun
If this is a test, with all due respect
You're not gonna fool no one
I'm everything she never was
Now everyone's out for my blood
Stop, you're making a scene
You're coming at me with blood in your teeth

562,That's All She Wrote,"[Hook 1: T.I.]
Now I don’t really care what you call me
Just as long as you don't call me broke
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Goodnight, it's over with, that's all she wrote
Streets like cold Chicago
Ain't nothin' new, I seen it all before
But still, I ball like no tomorrow
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
I said, it’s over with, that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
Goodnight, it's over with, that's all she wrote

[Verse 1: T.I.]
It's stupid how I go in knowin' everybody knowin'
That I’m sewin' up the game, destroyin' like they hate me for it
Eventually, see they can't beat and then with me, they join
Others sworn under oath or banished, left completely scorned
You tell lies, get cut, nigga, kick rocks
You never did blend in with the big shots
On the fast track, ain't no need for no pit stops
I just laugh at, nigga wishin' they were this hot
Guess they mad at me, huh? Really pissed off
Better that than pissed on, I’m the Jetsons, you the Flintstones
Catch me in the end zone, high-steppin', Prime Time
Thought you niggas been known, ain't no blockin' my shine
Like my new Air Yeezys, you can see me in the nighttime
I get rich off livin' life, you check to check, recitin' rhymes
So call me what you want, wanna hate? Have a nice time
While I get stupid paper, hey, my dough ain't in its right mind

[Hook 1: T.I.]
Now I don’t really care what you call me
Just as long as you don't call me broke
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Goodnight, it's over with, that's all she wrote
Streets like cold Chicago
Ain't nothin' new, I seen it all before
But still I ball like no tomorrow
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You're starin' straight into a barrel of hate
Terrible fate, not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missed
Wait, Sarah, you're late
Your train left, mascara and eggs smear in your face
Night's over, goodbye, ho, I thought that I told ya
That spilled nut ain't nothin' to cry over
Never shoulda came within range of my Rover
Shoulda known I was trouble soon as I rolled up
Any chick who's dumb enough after I blindfold her
To still come back to the crib
Must want me to mess with her mind, hold up
She mistook me for some high roller
But I won't buy her soda
Unless it's Rock and Rye cola (Faygo's cheaper)
Buy you a bag of Fritos?
I wouldn't let you eat the fucking chip on my shoulder
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't die for ya
Tryna pull five bucks from me is like tryna pull five molars
You'll get your eyes swolled up
I'm on my straight-grizzly
So why would I buy you a gay-ass teddy bear?
Bitch, you're already bi-polar

[Hook 2: Eminem]
Now I don’t really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches knew as soon as they saw me
It's never me they'll get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I’m gonna go
Still, I ball like there’s no tomorrow
Until it's over and that's all she wrote

[Verse 3: T.I.]
The credit roll, the curtain close, the movie over with (that's it)
But don’t get mad at me, go blame the chick who wrote this shit (nope)
Yeah, life is sure a bitch (bitch), but she know I’m rich (I'm rich)
That why she give me what I want and I just throw her dick
Here I go again, I kick this shit, give a damn, got it pourin' in
Pesos, Euros, Yen, ah-ha, I’m paid, never gon' be broke again
See me posted in anything, wearin' any chain
Never gon' see me totin' anything, all you gon' see is bang
It's so nice where I kick it, hate you never get to visit
Yeah, I’m on another level, but you niggas still can't get it
It's all over ‘fore you finish–sorry, bro, this where we end it
Won’t give you the satisfaction of me givin' you the business

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Yeah, I guess life is a bitch, ain't it, Tip?
And each one thinks they the shit
Shirt off my back? I wouldn’t give you the dirt off my handkerchief
I’m givin' these hoes a dose of their own medicine
Let 'em get a good taste of it
I’m sure you got that relationship memo by now
But in case you didn't, I'ma stick this whole pad full of sticky notes to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wastin' it
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker, that clock I'm racin' it
Double timing it, but I still spit triple the amount of
Insults in a tenth of the time that it may take you pricks
To catch on; while you strong arm, I'm like Stretch Armstrong
Man, I still say K-Mart's like there's an apostrophe 's' on it, dawg
And they say McDonald's isn’t a restaurant, well I guess I’m wrong
But if you're gonna tell me that the A&W ain't the spot for the best hot dogs, you can get the F on, dawg

[Bridge: T.I.]
And on my throne I remain, all alone in my lane
I’m as strong as the King, they were gone ‘fore they came
Now I don’t wanna hang, I slap five with them rap guys
They just wanna sabotage my hustle, shawty, that's why

[Hook 3: T.I. & Eminem]
Now I don’t really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I’m gonna go
But still I ball like there’s no tomorrow
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
I said, it's over with, that's all she wrote

563,Love Like Woe,"[Intro]
(J-J-J-J-J-R)
Wo-oh, oh-oh ooh
Wo-oh, oh-oh ooh
I kinda feel like it don't make
Like-like-like it don't make
Feel like it don't make s-s-s-s-sense

[Verse 1]
I'm thinking baby you and I are undeniable
But I'm findin' out love's unreliable
I'm giving all I got to make you stay
Or am I just a roadblock in your way?
'Cause you're a pretty little windstorm
Out on the boulevard
Something like a sunset
Oh, you're a shooting star
And I might drive myself insane
If those lips aren't speaking my name

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I've got some intuition or maybe I'm superstitious
But I think you're a pretty sweet pill that I'm swallowing down
To counter this addiction
You got me on a mission
Tell me darling can I get a break some-
How could I say no?

[Chorus]
She's got a love like woe!
(Wo-oh, oh-oh ooh)
Girl's got a love like woe!
(Wo-oh, oh-oh ooh, ba-da-dah)
I kinda feel like it don't make sense
'Cause you're bringing me in and now you're kicking me out again
Love so strong, then you moved on
Now I'm hung up in suspense
Because you're bringing me in and then you're kicking me out again

[Verse 2]
It's like a hurricane, speed train
She's a moving car
Catch her in the fast lane
Oh, I gotta know
Can I keep up with her pace?
Kick it into gear when I see that face
You can take up all my time 'cause you're the only one
That can make a storm cloud break
Pulling out the sun
And I can't get caught in the rain
Can I get your lips to speak my name?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I've got some intuition or maybe I'm superstitious
But I think you're a pretty sweet pill that I'm swallowing down
To counter this addiction
You got me on a mission
Tell me darling can I get a break some-
How could I say no?

She's got a love like woe!
(Wo-oh, oh-oh ooh)
Girl's got a love like woe!
(Wo-oh, oh-oh ooh, ba-da-dah)
I kinda feel like it don't make sense
'Cause you're bringing me in and now you're kicking me out again
Love so strong, then you moved on
Now I'm hung up in suspense
Because you're bringing me in and then you're kicking me out again

[Bridge]
'Cause we only have one life
The timing and the moment all seem so right
So would you say you're mine?
(We'll be just fine)
Would you say you're mine?
(We'll be just fine)

[Chorus]
She's got a love like woe
(Wo-oh, oh-oh ooh)
Girl's got a love like woe
(Wo-oh, oh-oh ooh, ba-da-dah)
I kinda feel like it don't make sense
'Cause you're bringing me in and now you're kicking me out again

569,Shake,"[JACQUES]
All the world’s a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances,
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms;
And then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

We never spoke a word
But every thought she had, I heard
From across the room
We were standing face to face
I couldn't find the words to say
Give me one more move
I don't even know her name
I guess foolish pride's to blame

[Chorus: Zac Brown]
Now I'm falling in love as she's walking away
And my heart won't tell my mind
To tell my mouth what it should say
I may have lost this battle
Live to fight another day
Now I'm falling in love as she's walking away

[Verse 2: Zac Brown & Alan Jackson]
Wise man next to me did say
About the one that got away
Son, I missed my chance
Don't you let regret take place
Of the dreams you have to chase
Ask her to dance
(Go on son)

[Pre-Chorus: Alan Jackson]
You might fall down on your face
Roll the dice and have some faith

[Chorus: Alan Jackson]
Don't be falling in love as she's walking away
When your heart won't tell your mind
To tell your mouth what it should say
You may have lost this battle
Live to fight another day
Don't be falling in love as she's walking away

[Pre-Chorus: Alan Jackson]
You might fall down on your face
Roll the dice and have some faith

Of a drummer in a band

And I ain't gonna try to tell another lie
You never should have let me in
Cause I'm the type of guy who (?) show you where my hands have been

Un regle was flung at the left wing of my brain
Branded a school-trained no-hoper full stop
When the Chaucer enforcer only used my second name

Gleavey is easily distracted
By the thoughts of famous footballers
His head is like a malleted stump
Somewhere between Aldi and Anfield

The headmasters bootboys blocking out the summer
The javelin went in one ear and out the other
The only love on show went to some erected athlete
We hardly got a kick in so we drifted off to sleep

Gleavey is easily distracted
By the thoughts of famous footballers
His head is like a malleted stump
Somewhere between Aldi and Anfield

Soon there was loads of us kicking away unseen
Cut off from barbers and sex appeal
Soon there was loads of us, nomadic nomarks
Humming vicious pop songs on a washed out field

Gleavey is easily distracted
By the thoughts of famous footballers
His head is like a malleted stump
Somewhere between Aldi and Anfield

Gleavey is easily distracted
By the thoughts of famous murderers

Driving drunk, I'm doing my thing
Rolling in the Midwest side and out
Living my life, getting out dreams
People told me slow my roll, I'm screaming out ""Fuck that""

If I fall, if I die, know I lived and missed some bullets

That the world would be okay
And Santa Claus would hear him say:

""I got dreams, and I got love
I got my feet on the ground
And family above
Can you send some happiness
With my best to the rest
Of the people of the East and the West and
Maybe every once in a while you
Give my grandma a reason to smile
'Tis the season of smile
It's cold but we'll be freezing in style

Let me meet a girl one day that
Wants to spread some love this way
We can let our souls run free and
She can open some happiness with me""

Christmas night, another fight
Tears, we cried a flood
Got all kinds of poison in
Of poison in my blood
I took my feet, to Oxford Street
Tryna right a wrong
Just walk away, those windows say
But I can't believe she's gone

When you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

Oh, they flicker and they float
But I'm up here holding on
To all those chandeliers of hope
Like some drunken Elvis singing
I go singing out of tune
Saying how I always loved you darling
And I always will

Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

Light up the street
Down where the sea and city meet
May all your troubles soon be gone

Then all my troubles will be gone

Damn, Cole World
I never thought I see that day that you my old girl
Now I’m stuck here hollerin' at ol' girl
Got one, got two, three, four girls
Shotgun in the drop made a right
Hut-one, hut-two, told them hoes take a hike
Then it’s on to the next—on—on to the next one
Hard to move on when you always regret one

I wonder sometimes
I wonder if I was wrong
Tryna do right by you got me here

All I want is you, now
All I want is you now

And that ass, don’t compare, at all, no
And at best, all they do is distract me but now

All I want is you, now
All I want is you now, sugar

All I want is you, ooh-ooh, ooh
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now, baby
Now that you’re gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

Cause they don’t smile, huh, or smell like you
And they don’t make me laugh, or even cook like you
And they don’t photograph, nah, they don't sex like you

That's why all I want is you now

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
I hit the club when you left me thinking that could heal shit
Tryna celebrate my Independence Day, Will Smith
Baby girl, who I’m kidding? Still sick, real shit
All my new hoes seem to get old real quick
And could it be, you everything that these plain bitches couldn’t be?
Is it a sign from the Lord that I shouldn’t be?
Lost in the player way, sorta get old to me
Got me on layaway, girl you got a hold on me
I say, ""I’m wrong"", you say, ""Come again?""
Damn, said I was wrong, look don’t rub it in
I got a lot on my mind, got a flock full of dimes
Like a line full of hoes, how they coming in
Just sayin', don’t wanna have me then somebody will
I’m playin', weight on my chest like I body build
I’m prayin', you ain’t content with tryna do your thang
And come back baby, boomerang, 'rang, huh

579,Loving You No More,"[Intro: Dirty Money]
So hard to breathe this air that we call love (ooh)
Ain't nothin' worse than the hurt we receive from love (ooh yeah)
When you get hurt by the one you livin' for
Pain can make you wanna love no more

[Refrain: Diddy]
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more
I love you more than I love myself

[Verse 1: Diddy]
Hurt with the heart that's bleeding slowly
So many lonely sleepless nights
I'm going through hell to convince she love me
But never her approval no matter how I try
The way you talk to me but still I say I love you
I’m ashamed you can see it in my eyes
Momma always told me to respect the woman
But what am I about to do when her parents do not try

[Bridge 1: Dirty Money]
So many tears I cried
But all for nothin' I’m afraid to say
Oh

[Refrain: Diddy & Dirty Money]
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (I can't)
I love you more than I love myself (no, woah)
Lovin' you no more (I can't)
I just, I can't, I just can’t be loving you no more (no, no, baby)
I love you more than I love myself

[Verse 2: Diddy]
I’ve been so dependent on your love for so long
Punishment for me is tryin' to let go
Give it from your heart is what you taught me
Addiction to pain is what it got me
My life, now it's changed
My life, ain't the same as you are
Heartbroke to the point sometimes wanna end it
If I can’t have what mean most to me

[Bridge 1: Dirty Money]
So many tears I cried (I cried)
But all for nothing I’m afraid to say
Oh, oh, oh

[Hook: Diddy & Dirty Money & Drake]
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (I can't)
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin' you no more  (I can't) (Diddy)
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (no, no, baby) (Drizzy baby, uh uh)
I love you more than I love myself

[Verse 3: Drake]
Uh, tryin' not to over think
Only 'cause I drove and I've done had a lot to drink
When I wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink
And there’s pieces of ya hair still sittin' in my sink
And you still got underwear that’s sittin' in the dryer
How come every time that you’re suspicious I’m a liar?
You stand out, I can hear you whistle in a choir
And that’s the only reason you the Mrs. I admire
Damn. Tell me what I’m gon' do?
Since everything that I’m trying to forget is all true
Me and all your main girls get along too
I would take my last dollar out and bet it on you
But uh, you see the same one I’m missing
Is basically the reason I became something different
And just that I remember me before
And if you could do the same, baby, then we’d be for sure

[Bridge 2: Dirty Money]
So selfishly, you can only show feelings
When you feel yours in jeopardy
Oh, time, oh, time has changed and I’m no longer willing
Can't you see how my heart is bleeding?
I guess I…

[Hook: Diddy & Dirty Money]
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (no, lovin' you no more)
I love you more than I love myself (no, no)
Lovin' you no more (I can't)
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (no, woah)
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin' you no more (oh, no)
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more
I love you more than I love myself
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more (just wanna love you baby)
I love you more than I love myself (just wanna love you baby)",Drake,2011,[91],1
580,When A Woman Loves,"[Chorus]
When a woman loves
She, she loves for real
When a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real

[Verse 1]
She took me back
After I broke her heart
About a thousand times
She gave her life to me
With no regrets, she followed me
And she, and she, the girl, she raised me
And I'm forever indebted
And I'm forever indebted
I'm forever indebted to her 'cause...

[Chorus]
When a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real
When a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real, oh

[Verse 2]
She filled my soul
With the very touch of her hand
She really did
And she’s got more, more faith in me than a beach got sand
And I'd like to tell her, I'd like to tell her
That I’m forever indebted
That I’m forever indebted
I’m forever indebted to her 'cause...

[Chorus]
When a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
See, a woman's love, it will never die, no
Even when I’m dead and gone
I’m gonna love her from the sky
'Cause she’s given me
Something that no other woman has given me
Woo-hoo, when I think about the girl, it makes me sing

[Chorus]
When, when, when, when, when a
When a, woman, loves
She loves for real, oh
When a woman loves, loves, loves
I'm telling you when she loves
She, she loves for real, yeah

[Outro]
Woo-hoo
When she loves (when she loves)
When she loves (when she loves)
When she loves (when she loves)
Oh, When she loves (when she loves)
When she loves (when she loves)
When she loves (when she loves)
She (when she loves)
She (when she loves)
She loves for real

As we danced in the night, remember
How the stars stole the night away, oh yeah

My thoughts are with you, holdin' hands with your heart to see you

How we knew love was here to stay
Now December, found the love that we shared in September
Only blue talk and love, remember, the true love we share today

584,"Baby, It's Cold Outside","[Verse 1: Marilyn Maxwell & Dean Martin]
I really can't stay (But, baby, it's cold outside)
I've got to go away (But, baby, it's cold outside)
This evening has been (Been hoping that you'd drop in)
So very nice (I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice)
My mother will start to worry (Beautiful, what's your hurry?)
My father will be pacing the floor (Listen to the fireplace roar)
So, really, I'd better scurry (Beautiful, please don't hurry)
But maybe just a half a drink more (Put some records on while I pour)
The neighbors might think (Baby, it's bad out there)
Say, what's in this drink? (No cab's to be had out there)
I wish I knew how (Your eyes are like starlight now)
To break this spell (I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)
I ought to say, ""No, no, no, sir"" (Mind if I move in closer?)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (What's the sense of hurtin' my pride?)

[Chorus: Marilyn Maxwell, Dean Martin & Both]
I really can't stay
(Oh, baby, don't hold out)
Baby, it's cold outside

[Verse 2: Marilyn Maxwell & Dean Martin]
I simply must go (But, baby, it's cold outside)
The answer is no (But, baby, it's cold outside)
Your welcome has been (How lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (Look out the window at the storm)
My sister will be suspicious (Gosh your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (Waves upon the tropical shore)
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious (Gosh your lips are delicious)
But maybe just a cigarette more (Never such a blizzard before)
I've gotta get home (But, baby, you'd freeze out there)
Say, lend me a coat (It's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand (I thrill when you touch my hand)
But don't you see? (How can you do this thing to me?)
There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Think of my lifelong sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied (If you got pneumonia and died)

[Chorus: Marilyn Maxwell, Dean Martin & Both]
I really can't stay

Baby, it's cold
Baby, it's cold outside",Dean Martin,2011,[99],1

And I don't know how
You do the things you do while I sleep on Christmas eve
But it's amazing
And I bet that you could bring me back my baby
Because every time I see Christmas lights
I feel this burn inside
And I just can't take it

And his new girl was so bleak
And then I swore to myself
Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas night

I heard that it's really gonna snow this year
So I hope Rudolph and them other eight reindeer
Get you safely here
So you can scoop him up and swoop him right down my chimney
I've been really, really, really good this year
So put on that red suit and make him appear
’Cause Christmas cheer
Just ain't the same without my baby
Come on, oh Kris Kringle, send me help

But I believe in you Saint Nick
So grant this wish for me right quick
