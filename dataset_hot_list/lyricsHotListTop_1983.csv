1,Say It Isn't So,"You got me all screwed up
So much I can't turn 'round
And I've been running about with some funny girls
I'm not so tough
But if you let me down (I'll tell ya)
I'd give you just one day to explain
I'd like to know if there's somebody else in this game

Say it isn't so, tell me I'm the only one
Say it isn't so, without you I can't go on
How was I to know, if you keep me guessing I don't understand

I can't sleep at night
I keep on dreaming you're gone
I'm staring into a space that was filled by your face
Facing the day
A face in the crowd
I'm sure I saw you just a moment ago
There must be something you don't want me to know

Say it isn't so, you got the magic touch
Say it isn't so, the one that I need so much
Say it isn't so, how was I to know
If you keep me guessing I don't understand

There's something wrong, suspicion's getting stronger
Don't know if I can stand this pain much longer
You play around but I see right through you

It's lonely on the streets when it's just one a.m
See a lot of pretty girls passing by
I'm walking in the midnight sun once again
And now I know why love is so blind
Cos when you're out of my sight
I'm out of your mind

Say it isn't so, tell me I'm the only one
Say it isn't so, without you I can't go on
How was I to know, if you keep me guessing I don't understand

2,Union Of The Snake,"Telegram force and ready
I knew this was a big mistake
There's a fine line drawing
My senses together
And I think it's about to break

If I listen close I can hear them singers
Voices in your body coming through on the radio
The Union of the Snake is on the climb
Moving up it's gonna race it's gonna break
Through the borderline

Nightshades on a warning
Give me strength at least give me a light
Give me anything even sympathy
There's a chance you could be right

Voices in your body coming through on the radio

Moving up it's gonna race it's gonna break

3,Owner Of A Lonely Heart,"[​Intro]​

[Verse 1]
Move yourself
You always live your life
Never thinking of the future
Prove yourself
You are the move you make
Take your chances, win or loser
See yourself
You are the steps you take
You and you, and that's the only way
Shake, shake yourself
You're every move you make
So the story goes

[Verse 2]
Say - you don't want to chance it
You've been hurt so before
Watch it now

How he dancin' one and only
You, lose yourself
No not for pity's sake
There's no real reason to be lonely
Be yourself
Give your free will a chance
You've got to want to succeed

Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
(Much better than a)
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart

Owner of a lonely heart

After my own indecision
They confused me so
Owner of a lonely heart
My love said never question your will at all
In the end you've got to go
Look before you leap
Owner of a lonely heart
And don't you hesitate at all - no no
Yow!
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah!

Will decide the lonely heart

But maybe someday when my ship comes in

You're begging me to go
Then making me stay
Why do you hurt me so bad?
It would help me to know

Believe me
I can't tell you why
But I'm trapped by your love
And I'm chained to your side

When I'm losing control
Will you turn me away
Or touch me deep inside?
And when all this gets old
Will it still feel the same?

I could lose control
And if your heart surrenders
You'll need me to hold

Baby, baby, baby

[Verse 1]
So you think you got an evil mind?
Well, I'll tell you honey
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
So you think my singing's out of time
Well, it makes me money
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
Anymore, oh no

So come on, feel the noise
Girls, grab their boys

At your door

[Verse 2]
So you think I got a funny face
Well, I ain't no worry
And I don't know why

Say I'm a dog and God it's no disgrace
And I ain't no hurry
And I don't know why
And I don't know why

So you think we have a lazy time
Well you should know better

I just don't know why

15,Synchronicity II,"Another suburban family morning
Grandmother screaming at the wall
We have to shout above the din of our Rice Krispies
We can't hear anything at all
Mother chants her litany of boredom and frustration
But we know all her suicides are fake
Daddy only stares into the distance
There's only so much more that he can take
Many miles away
Something crawls from the slime
At the bottom of a dark Scottish lake

Another industrial ugly morning
The factory belches filth into the sky
He walks unhindered through the picket lines today
He doesn't think to wonder why
The secretaries pout and preen like
Cheap tarts in a red light street
But all he ever thinks to do is watch
And every single meeting with his so-called superior
Is a humiliating kick in the crotch
Many miles away
Something crawls to the surface
Of a dark Scottish loch

Another working day has ended
Only the rush hour hell to face
Packed like lemmings into shiny metal boxes
Contestants in a suicidal race
Daddy grips the wheel and stares alone into the distance
He knows that something somewhere has to break
He sees the family home now looming in his headlights
The pain upstairs that makes his eyeballs ache
Many miles away
There's a shadow on the door
Of a cottage on the shore
Of a dark Scottish lake
Many miles away, many miles away",The Police,1983,"[16, 16, 16, 16, 19, 22, 34, 41, 54]",9

There's a loving in your eyes all the way

How to sell a contradiction
You come and go, you come and go

[Chorus]
Karma karma karma karma karma chameleon
You come and go, you come and go
Loving would be easy if your colors were like my dreams
Red gold and green, red gold and green

[Verse 2]
Didn't hear your wicked words every day
And you used to be so sweet, I heard you say

[Pre-Chorus]
That my love was an addiction
When we cling, our love is strong
When you go, you're gone forever
You string along, you string along

You come and go, you come and go

17,Islands In The Stream,"[Verse 1: Kenny Rogers]
Baby, when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside
There was something going on

[Verse 2: Kenny Rogers & Dolly Parton]
You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got something going on

[Pre-Chorus: Kenny Rogers & Dolly Parton]
Tender love is blind, it requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
We ride it together, ah ha
From one love to another, ah ha

[Chorus: Kenny Rogers & Dolly Parton]
Islands in the stream that is what we are
No one in between how can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, ah ha
From one lover to another, ah ha

[Verse 3: Dolly Parton]
I can't live without you if the love has gone
Everything is nothing when you got no one
And you walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing

[Verse 4: Kenny Rogers & Dolly Parton]
But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing

[Pre- Chorus: Kenny Rogers & Dolly Parton]
No more will you cry, baby, I will hurt you never
We start and end as one in love forever
We can ride it together, ah ha
From one love to another, ah ha

No one in between how can we be wrong

""Huuuh?""
Yeah, huh, y'all niggas shot me last night
Smoked a nigga for nothing, fuck

[Ice Cube]
Why the fuck you wanna murder me?
Your punk ass never heard of me
I never did nuttin' to your family
Still you wanna kill a young nigga randomly
You wanna take the life God handed to me
Send it back to him cause you ain't a fan of me
Scary bitch with a gun that ain't a man to me
That's a animal, a fuckin' cannibal
I'm Geronimo and Hannibal, with international
Gangster pull, I'm a bull in Barcelona
With a Corona, you's a fake-ass nigga
Where's your owner? I'm a real live man
You a persona, now I'm a goner
Call my momma, and the coroner
Mr. Gun Man, your plan is workin'
Cause niggas is dyin', and mommas is hurtin'

[Chorus: Musiq Soulchild]
Why you wanna murder me? You never ever heard of me
You don't know who I am, I could be part of your family tree
Now, sent by G-O-D, to save the world, you and me
You never know who you facin', who you chasin', the life you wastin'

[Ice Cube]
I was made by the one and only G-O-D
To take my life, to the T-O-P
Now here comes a motherfuckin' D-O-G
Who ain't happy 'til a nigga is R.I.P
Tryin' to be somethin' he saw on BET
Either T.I.P., or B.I.G
I don't give a fuck what you saw on TV
But a one-eight-seven don't make an O.G
I'm an O.G., never had to fake it
God gave me this, how you gon' take it?
What'chu gon' tell 'em, when you get to heaven
And he asks you why did you send back his present?
Who the fuck are you? you motherfuckin peasant!
Even got the nerve to ask the man for a blessing
Send his ass to Hades with his big Mercedes
Nigga hell on earth is bein' stuck in the 80's

[Chorus: Musiq Soulchild]
Why you wanna murder me? You never ever heard of me
You don't know who I am, I could be part of your family tree
Now, sent by G-O-D, to save the world, you and me
You never know who you facin', who you chasin', the life you wastin'

[Ice Cube]
Before you shoot me man think about it
Let's go have a drink about it (Yeah)
Before you make a stink about it
Man let's talk about it maybe we can walk up out it
But just don't be a coward
And take my life, cause you got the power
Of the white man's gunpowder
Cause you might face a gun tower
And time never run out
They take the fun out, 'til your life run out
So don't pull the gun out
If you ever want a house just like Run's house
It's better than the big house
Let's go find some women we can dig out
Find a place we can pig out
Party all night 'til the owner say get out

[Chorus: Musiq Soulchild]
Why you wanna murder me? You never ever heard of me
You don't know who I am, I could be part of your family tree

19,In A Big Country,"I've never seen you look like this without a reason
Another promise fallen through
Another season passes by you
I never took the smile away from anybody's face
And that's a desperate way to look for someone who is still a child

[Chorus]
In a big country dreams stay with you
Like a lover's voice fires the mountainside
Stay alive, here we go

I thought that pain and truth were things that really mattered
But you can't stay here with every single hope you had shattered
I'm not expecting to grow flowers in the desert
But I can live and breathe and see the sun in wintertime

[Chorus]
In a big country dreams stay with you
Like a lover's voice fires the mountainside
Stay alive

[Chorus]
In a big country dreams stay with you
Like a lover's voice fires the mountainside
Stay alive

So take that look out of here, it doesn't fit you
Because it's happened doesn't mean you've been discarded
Pull up your head off the floor, come up screaming
Cry out for everything you ever might have wanted
I thought that pain and truth were things that really mattered
But you can't stay here with every single hope you had shattered
I'm not expecting to grow flowers in the desert
But I can live and breathe and see the sun in wintertime

[Chorus]
In a big country dreams stay with you
Like a lover's voice fires the mountainside
Stay alive

20,Running With The Night,"[Verse 1]
The heart of the city street was beating
Light from the neons turned the dark to day
We were too hot to think of sleeping
We had to get out before the magic got away

[Chorus]
We were running with the night
Playing in the shadows
Just you and I, 'til the morning light
We were running, running with the night

[Verse 2]
You were looking so good girl, heads were turning
You and me on the town ooh, we let it all hang out
The fire was in us, we were burning
We were going to go all the way and we never had a doubt

[Chorus]
We were running with the night
Playing in the shadows
Just you and I, 'til the morning light
We were running, running with the night

[Bridge]
We were so in love you and me
On the boulevard wild and free
Giving all we got, we laid it down
Taking every shot, we took the town

[Chorus]
We were running with the night
Playing in the shadows
Just you and I, 'til the morning light
We were running, running with the night
We were running with the night
Playing in the shadows

I have been up three days
Adderall and redbull
This call is a mistake
There’s something strong in this water bottle
I hear you got a new chick
A dancing little Barbie doll
I feel so pathetic
But you still haven’t heard it all

[Hook]
Fuck that new girl that you like so bad
She’s not crazy like me I bet you like that
I said fuck that new girl that’s been in your bed
And when you’re in her I know I’m in your head
I’m just saying you can do better
Always turned you out every time we were together
Once you had the best you can’t do better
Baby I’m the best so you can’t do better

[Verse 2]
I ran into your homeboys
They’re all fucking idiots
You’re not even my boyfriend
But they're tripping because I’m in the club
Yeah that’s right I’m dancing
And something cool is in my cup
I’ma send a sexy picture
To remind you what you’ve given up

Fuck that new girl that you like so bad
She’s not crazy like me I bet you like that
I said fuck that new girl that’s been in your bed

Snot spits

[Verse 1]
Better listen, better learn how
Hold up!
Let me get this verse out
It turns out
I ain't ever turned down
I ain't ever took a break: never burned out
Never look away when my fate didn't work out
Never hesitated never fake when you word count
Never worried 'bout
What they say with the slurred mouth
I never play, set the pace I prefer now
This is that killer pale face you heard 'bout
Word of mouth bro, only ate what he told
There's an untold toll that it take on your soul, ya
They serving french fries, cake with the pie
I've been serving up porterhouse steak with a side
Of orange crepe, you're great, poor taste I divine
Survival in this game I would stake on your life, ey
Make no mistake have faith in your guy
Way they cry seen 'em turn the four lakes into five
Great!

[Chorus]
Another day goes by: another game show
I'm on my grind date working on my angles
When angels cry I put on my raincoat
Thinking life is all sugarcoated rainbows
I'm in the same boat
Pushing things slow
Heard that you reap what you sow
Pay what you owe
Play the game now, pay the piper
Motherfucker
Read 'em and weep!

[Verse 2]
They want to get up in the game and be a star
I deal them in and they complain about the cards
Fuck anybody who ain't about the bars
Busting on anybody trying to play around with ours, ya
The killer city committee chair; I'm very rare
Ubiquitous and the U-B-I; I'm everywhere
I show up wearing a suit and tie like Fred Astaire
And scrutinize whoever there with heavy stares
Where the party at? ""Over here!""
I'm headed there
Whoever tripping they need to bury and dead it there
Whoever scared can go to church, I say the prayer
Five nights and Freddy's scary as teddy bears
Paranoia propel people to perpetrate a personal
Parallel punishment push to permeate the process
Punk I'm a pro, plenty of payroll
Penny for your Pinocchio pathological pay, ya
I'm in the same boat
Pushing things slow
Heard that you reap what you sow
Pay what you owe
Play the game now, pay the piper
Motherfucker
Read 'em and weep!

Another day goes by: another game show
I'm on my grind date working all the angles
When angels cry I put on my raincoat

Heard that you reap what you sow
Pay what you owe
Play the game now, pay the piper
Motherfucker
Read 'em and weep!

[Verse 3]
I've been headed towards the pain since the fourth grade
They want to know about the chain, how the tour pay?
The fuck is your name?
Banging on 'em war game
I pull up on 'em like I'm hanging on a doorframe
Calisthenic, yeah I move about a mile a minute
A lot of you claim you got it but don't know how to get it
Homie how could you fish if you never bought a pole?
Yo how could you swim in an empty pot of gold?
Fucking how could you sin if you never got a soul?
Santa Clause coming to visit he got a lot of coal
I spent a whole lot of time in one spot alone
Now I'm international known super like Sabado
Mission Impossible, keep the peace, the flow
In platanos; homie please believe
Until the holes in your zapatos cease to be
I'm like Papa don't preach to me

You can't trust 'em you can't love 'em
No good deed goes unpunished
And I don't mind bein' their whippin' boy
I've had that pleasure for years and years
No no I never was a sinner--tell me what else can I do
Second best is what you get 'til you learn to bend the rules
And time respects no person--what you lift up must fall
They're waiting outside to claim my tumblin' walls

Saw my picture in the paper
Read the news around my face
And now some people don't want to treat me the same

When the walls come tumblin' down
When the walls come crumblin' crumblin'
When the walls come tumblin' tumblin' down

Some people say I'm obnoxious and lazy
I'm uneducated--my opinion means nothin'
But I know I'm a real good dancer
Don't need to look over my shoulder to see what I'm after
Everybody's got their problems--ain't no new news here
I'm the same old trouble you've been havin' for years
Don't confuse the problem with the issue girl
It's perfectly clear
Just a human desire to have you come near

Wanna put my arms around you
Feel your breath in my ear
You can bend me you can break me
But you'd better stand clear

When the walls come tumblin' down
When the walls come crumblin' crumblin'
When the walls come tumblin' tumblin' down",John Mellencamp,1983,"[24, 24, 14, 9, 9, 9, 14, 19, 21, 27, 34, 42]",12

I've been lost inside, empty space in my heart
And some things never change, oh
How it hurts me and how it's tearin' me apart
And it just goes on and on

Can you read my mind
Take a good look at my face
Could you take the time
Just to stand here in my place

What if I'd been the one to say goodbye, goodbye
Could you smile when inside you just wanna cry, look inside
Can you read my mind? Oh, oh

When I hear your name
Feel so cold deep inside
Still it's hard to explain, oh
What your love meant to me
They say time will heal the pain
But it just goes on forever

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you read my mind
Have you closed the door on love
Can you be so blind
Did you think I'd just give up

[Chorus]
What if I'd been the one to say goodbye, goodbye
Could you smile when inside you just wanna cry, wanna cry
What if I'd been the one to say goodbye, goodbye
Could you smile when it hurts so deep inside
And it never fades away
Fade away

[Bridge]
Time can't erase the reasons why
Count my mistakes and the heartaches
Since you said goodbye

What if I'd been the one to say goodbye, goodbye
Could you smile when inside you just wanna cry, wanna cry

What can I do ?
To make you feel secure
Remove all your doubts
So that you know for sure that your the apple of my eye girl
Fulfillment of my dreams, time , will show the value
Of just what you mean to me
More precious than silver
More precious than diamond rings
Or anything that I could give you, it wouldn't mean a thing
If you didn't have my love beside you there to guide you through
But is it good to know you do

[Hook]
I know just how you feel
But this time love's for real
In time it will reveal
That special love that's deep inside of us
Will all reveal in time

[Verse 2/El DeBarge]
I tell you I love you
But you won't believe its true

Goodnight, it's over with, that's all she wrote
Streets like cold Chicago
Ain't nothin' new, I seen it all before
But still, I ball like no tomorrow
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
I said, it’s over with, that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
Goodnight, it's over with, that's all she wrote

[Verse 1: T.I.]
It's stupid how I go in knowin' everybody knowin'
That I’m sewin' up the game, destroyin' like they hate me for it
Eventually, see they can't beat and then with me, they join
Others sworn under oath or banished, left completely scorned
You tell lies, get cut, nigga, kick rocks
You never did blend in with the big shots
On the fast track, ain't no need for no pit stops
I just laugh at, nigga wishin' they were this hot
Guess they mad at me, huh? Really pissed off
Better that than pissed on, I’m the Jetsons, you the Flintstones
Catch me in the end zone, high-steppin', Prime Time
Thought you niggas been known, ain't no blockin' my shine
Like my new Air Yeezys, you can see me in the nighttime
I get rich off livin' life, you check to check, recitin' rhymes

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You're starin' straight into a barrel of hate
Terrible fate, not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missed
Wait, Sarah, you're late
Your train left, mascara and eggs smear in your face
Night's over, goodbye, ho, I thought that I told ya
That spilled nut ain't nothin' to cry over
Never shoulda came within range of my Rover
Shoulda known I was trouble soon as I rolled up
Any chick who's dumb enough after I blindfold her
To still come back to the crib
Must want me to mess with her mind, hold up
She mistook me for some high roller
But I won't buy her soda
Unless it's Rock and Rye cola (Faygo's cheaper)
Buy you a bag of Fritos?
I wouldn't let you eat the fucking chip on my shoulder
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't die for ya
Tryna pull five bucks from me is like tryna pull five molars
You'll get your eyes swolled up
I'm on my straight-grizzly
So why would I buy you a gay-ass teddy bear?
Bitch, you're already bi-polar

[Hook 2: Eminem]
Now I don’t really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches knew as soon as they saw me
It's never me they'll get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I’m gonna go
Still, I ball like there’s no tomorrow
Until it's over and that's all she wrote

[Verse 3: T.I.]
The credit roll, the curtain close, the movie over with (that's it)
But don’t get mad at me, go blame the chick who wrote this shit (nope)
Yeah, life is sure a bitch (bitch), but she know I’m rich (I'm rich)
That why she give me what I want and I just throw her dick
Here I go again, I kick this shit, give a damn, got it pourin' in
Pesos, Euros, Yen, ah-ha, I’m paid, never gon' be broke again
See me posted in anything, wearin' any chain
Never gon' see me totin' anything, all you gon' see is bang
It's so nice where I kick it, hate you never get to visit
Yeah, I’m on another level, but you niggas still can't get it
It's all over ‘fore you finish–sorry, bro, this where we end it
Won’t give you the satisfaction of me givin' you the business

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Yeah, I guess life is a bitch, ain't it, Tip?
And each one thinks they the shit
Shirt off my back? I wouldn’t give you the dirt off my handkerchief
I’m givin' these hoes a dose of their own medicine
Let 'em get a good taste of it
I’m sure you got that relationship memo by now
But in case you didn't, I'ma stick this whole pad full of sticky notes to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wastin' it
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker, that clock I'm racin' it
Double timing it, but I still spit triple the amount of
Insults in a tenth of the time that it may take you pricks
To catch on; while you strong arm, I'm like Stretch Armstrong
Man, I still say K-Mart's like there's an apostrophe 's' on it, dawg
And they say McDonald's isn’t a restaurant, well I guess I’m wrong
But if you're gonna tell me that the A&W ain't the spot for the best hot dogs, you can get the F on, dawg

[Bridge: T.I.]
And on my throne I remain, all alone in my lane
I’m as strong as the King, they were gone ‘fore they came
Now I don’t wanna hang, I slap five with them rap guys
They just wanna sabotage my hustle, shawty, that's why

[Hook 3: T.I. & Eminem]
Now I don’t really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I’m gonna go
But still I ball like there’s no tomorrow
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
I said, it's over with, that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote

27,I Still Can't Get Over Loving You,"I'm all confused and I don't know what to do
'cause I still can't get over loving you
I've had time but I can't get you off my mind
No
I still can't get over loving you
Ev'ry time I run into your friends
I just have to ask them with who and where you've been
And when they tell me what I really didn't wanna know
It only breaks my heart
Makes me want your love
When I hear your name I get more in save
'cause I still can't get over loving you
I can't turn it loose though I know it's selfabuse
I still can't get over loving you
I've tried to get involved with someone new
But it's just no use 'cause I expect them to be like you
Baby
I don't know what I'm gonna do
'cause ev'ry girl I date resembles you
Oh
Help me
Baby
I'm goin' crazy
I still can't get over loving you
No
It's tearin' my heart apart
'cause I still can't get over loving you
Girl
I'm so sad and if hurts me so bad
Knowin' you're with someone else - someone else
Though I have no right to be
I'm filled with jealousy
'cause I want you for myself
I'm not blaming you
Aw
Baby
It's not your fault
If you don't feel the way I do
And even though I wish that you still loved me
It still won't change the way I feel for you
Girl
I can't forget
It's not over yet:
I still can't get over loving you
Ev'ry breath you take
I'll be watching you
Girl
'cause I still can't get over loving you
Lovin' you
There's no way to this thing's through
No
I still can't get over - not yet
I ain't through loving you. I'm gettin' mad
Girl
Lovin' you
Don't you ever try to leave- no
No - I still can't get over
It'll be the last thing you'll ever do

28,Pink Houses,"[Verse 1]
There's a black man with a black cat
Livin' in a black neighborhood
He's got an Interstate runnin' through his front yard
You know he thinks that he's got it so good
And there's a woman in the kitchen
Cleanin' up the evenin' slop
And he looks at her and says
""Hey darlin', I can remember when
You could stop a clock.""

[Chorus]
Oh, but ain't that America for you and me
Ain't that America somethin' to see baby
Ain't that America home of the free
Little pink houses for you and me

[Verse 2]
There's a young man in a t-shirt
Listenin' to a rockin' rollin' station
He's got greasy hair, greasy smile
He says, ""Lord this must be my destination.""
Cause they told me when I was younger
""Boy you're gonna be president.""
But just like everything else those old crazy dreams
Just kinda came and went

[Chorus]
Oh, but ain't that America for you and me
Ain't that America somethin' to see baby
Ain't that America home of the free
Little pink houses for you and me

[Bridge]
Well there's people and more people
What do they know know know
Go to work in some high rise
And vacation down at the Gulf of Mexico
Ooh yeah
And there's winners and there's losers
But they ain't no big deal
Cause the simple man baby pays for the thrills, the bills
The pills that kill

[Chorus]
Oh, but ain't that America for you and me
Ain't that America somethin' to see baby
Ain't that America home of the free
Little pink houses for you and me

Oh, but ain't that America for you and me

29,Ain't Nobody,"[Hook]
I don't care about an argument I'll still be here tomorrow
For you
I gotta room up in the city we can play finish the bottle
I'll pour you up, we'll work on us
Cause ain't nobody taking my baby
I wanna be clear, I'm stayin' right here
Cause ain't nobody takin' my baby

[Verse 1]
Your heart weighs a ton
Girl watch me heavy lift
How many more times we gon' argue over petty shit
I mess up but shit you mess up too
The way you answer makes me question you
I guess your body ain't the only thing that's flexible
You bend the truth, we lettin' loose, verbal warfare
Open wounds we still poke even tho we know it's sore there
Cause hurt people hurt people, that's a known fact
You got me tempted to say fuck it where my hoes at
But I know that they don't last, that's why I don't go back
I stay put I want you, I don't care I want you

Cause ain't nobody takin' my baby

[Verse 2]
It was me and you in love for a quick summer
Now we textin' question marks cause we switched numbers
Lookin' back you were the perfect fit
Didn't let me fuck right away you made me work for it
Use to ride around drunk you brought out the worst in me
Damn I went to jail with you and that was a first for me
Heaven knows that I was hell bent
First time we said we love each other was through cell vents
Guess I should've known then
But I'm stubborn I'll admit that
At least I got some classic rap songs from your mishaps
Shit I ain't perfect though, I stayed what's wrong with me
I'm in love with challenges, girl that's just honesty
No matter what tho I stayed put
Till it wasn't funny anymore like Dane cook
Out of sync out of touch, I should probably give it up but
I'm a lover not a fighter but I'll fight for what I love

[Hook]
I don't care about an argument I'll still be here tomorrow

Hear the dogs howling out of key

And bleed, the company lost the war today

[Chorus]
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday

[Verse 2]
Hear the drum pounding out of time
Another protester has crossed the line (Hey!)
To find the money's on the other side
Can I get another Amen? (Amen!)
There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (Hey!)
A gag, a plastic bag on a monument

[Chorus]
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday

[Bridge]
""The representative from California has the floor""
Sieg Heil to the president Gasman
Bombs away is your punishment
Pulverize the Eiffel towers
Who criticize your government
Bang bang goes the broken glass
And kill all the fags that don't agree
Trials by fire, setting fire
Is not a way that's meant for me
Just ‘cause, just ‘cause
Because we're outlaws, yeah!

34,The Sign Of Fire,"Heart of stone -- I tried to reach you
Of the altar stone -- I tried to warn you
But you were not alone -- you wouldn't take the call
You wear brimstone -- I tried to warm you

Always the same desire
After the tone -- they try to storm you
You are a voice alone and who dares to question
Forgotten at home - how do you live with
Do you wear brimstone -- give me the call

Always the sign is fire
I'm being drawn by the heat
Always the same desire. Hot

Through the telephone -- I tried to reach you
But if you're not alone -- I know your life is torn
I see your lover's tomb -- why don't you mention
To me whenever I call -- I'll try to warm you

Do you remember that knife you wouldn't part with?
You  kept it sharp just to carve my fuckin' heart like a park bench
Well I found it this morning in a Southside bus stop
And I'm smiling for this mugshot
That's when I knew the plan was bound to fail
By the time you hear the song I'll be singing it from down at county jail
Still filled to the maximum
So fuck Bill Clinton with his saxophone
And cut, I'm trying to follow a lit fuse
I must have missed a day's allowance of fish food
Like who's tit do you think that this is dude?
She ain't your bitch to misuse
And when there ain't nothing more to grab
I might give something back to the floor of this cab
I might tag my name on the door of your building
Might even make a couple of your children

(Uncle Sam ain't no kin to me) One, two
Three four grams and a fifth of Hennessy
A bad bitch, fuck the penitentiary
Section 80s babies, blame Ronald Reagan
We raising hell, hell (Oh)
Lord forbid, the homie got wet, so we trying to soak it in
The president is black, but you can't vote for skin
You vote for the better man
Come to our show, you can see the diversity
Unify the people, they gon' peep it universally
We might not change the world
But we gon' manipulate it, I hope you participatin'
Ayo, Dot, won't you let these cats know?
We knew we'd be here, like, back in 04'
Started HiiiPower because our generation needed a generator
In a system meant to disintegrate us (Ooh!)
And all we do is assist them
We're not victors, we're victims
The bigger picture isn't developed yet
Like, what if Keisha was celibate?
Or what if Tammy came across a real man
Who didn't play games like children?
My nigga cheated on his girlfriend
With his girlfriend's girlfriend, let the world end
And everybody tripping off 2012
And the extraterrestrial presence as well
(Odd Future's aight) But our future is not
That martial law shit drop, we gon' all get got
So keep that question mark on your face
Eat your fast food, use your fluoride toothpaste
Hide your feelings from the public, work your lil' nine to five
Don't forget to pay your tithes and thank God you're alive
HiiiPower
And on another note
We focused like the Hubble Telescope

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Alori Joh]
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
I'm ready to go, ready to go
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
Ready to go, ready to go
Life is a traffic jam

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar & Ab-Soul]
I wrote this because I was ordered to
People say I speak for generation Y
Why lie, I do, Section 80
Your son will play me if the radio won't
Daughters that just turn 1 'til 21 listen to Kendrick
For instance:
What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
Take out that student loan, and pay off your college degree
And do exactly what you see on TV
True story!
Hmm
Can you repeat that for me, Soul?
What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
Is you gon' plead the fifth or sound the horn?
The time is now, my child, come on
See, a lot of y'all don't understand Kendrick Lamar
Because you wonder how I could talk about money, hoes, clothes, God, and history all in the same sentence
You know what all the things have in common?
Only half of the truth, if you tell it
See I spent 23 years on this earth searching for answers
'Til one day I realized I had to come up with my own
I'm not on the outside looking in
I'm not on the inside looking out
I'm in the dead fucking center, looking around
You ever seen a newborn baby kill a grown man?
That's an analogy for the way the world make me react
My innocence been dead
So, the next time I talk about money, hoes, clothes, God, and history all in the same sentence
Just know I meant it, and you felt it
'Cause you too are searching for answers
I'm not the next pop star, I'm not the next socially-aware rapper
I am a human motherfucking being over dope-ass instrumentation
Kendrick Lamar!
Now fuck 'em up, Terrace!
(Soul!)

I watch this fire that we’re gathered around
And see that it burns similar to the fire that’s inside you
Section.80
Section.80 babies
A generation of bliss and disobedience
Know they can't control us
Know they can't control you
Know they can't control us
But we can control each other
We build our own world
If you don't leave with nothing else tonight
You will leave with knowing yourself
You will leave knowing that you represent something that's bigger than all of us
Our family
Heart, honor, and respect
This is you
This is me
And we are HiiiPower

One ticket please
Lord have mercy, looks like everybody's here
Hey, what's going on, man?
Yeah, she's at home, yeah she's at home, yeah she's at home

Let the music play
I just wanna dance the night away
Yeah right here, right here where I'm gonna stay
All night long oooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooo
Let the music play on
Just until I feel this misery is gone
Movin, kickin, groovin
Keep the music strong
On and on and on and on and on and on

I'm out here dancing and still - huh
I can't erase the things I feel
The tender love we used to share
See, it like it's no longer there
I've got to hide what's killing me inside

Chorus

I think I'm gonna be alright - ha ha ha
If I can make it thru the night, oh Lord
I'll just pretend she's here with me
I'll close my eyes, her face I'll see
I know it's make believe, but it's the only hope for me

43,An Innocent Man,"Some people stay far away from the door
If there's a chance of it opening up
They hear a voice in the hall outside
And hope that it just passes by

Some people live with the fear of a touch
And the anger of having been a fool
They will not listen to anyone
So nobody tells them a lie

I know you're only protecting yourself
I know you're thinking of somebody else
Someone who hurt you

But I'm not above making up for the love
You've been denying you could ever feel
I'm not above doing anything
To restore your faith if I can

Some people see through the eyes of the old
Before they ever get a look at the young
I'm only willing to hear you cry
Because I am an innocent man

[Chorus]
I am an innocent man
Oh, yes I am

Some people say they will never believe
Of the promise they hear in the dark
Because they only remember too well
They heard somebody tell them before

Some people sleep all alone every night
Instead of taking a lover to bed
Some people find that it's easier to hate
Then to wait anymore

I know you don't want to hear what I say
I know you're gonna keep turning away
But I've been there

And if I can survive I can keep you alive
I'm not above going through it again
I'm not above being cool for a while
If you're cruel to me, I'll understand

Some people run from a possible fight
Some people figure they can never win
And although this is a fight I can lose
The accused is an innocent man

[Chorus]
I am an innocent man
Oh, yes I am
An innocent man

You know you only hurt yourself out of spite
I guess you'd rather be a martyr tonight
That's your decision

But I'm not below anybody I know
If there's a chance of resurrecting a love
I'm not above going back to the start
To find out where the heartache began

Some people hope for a miracle cure
Some people just accept the world as it is
But I'm not willing to lay down and die
Because I am an innocent man

[Chorus]
I am an innocent man
Oh, yes I am
An innocent man, Oooh",Billy Joel,1983,"[44, 44, 51]",3

47,Nightbird,"[Verse 1]
And the summer became the fall
I was not ready for the winter
It makes no difference at all
'Cause I wear boots all summer long
My eye makeup, dark, and it's careless
Same circles around my eyes
Sometimes the real color of my skin
My eyes, without any shadow

[Chorus]
And when I call, will you walk gently though my shadow?
The ones who sing at night
The ones who sing at night
The ones you dream of, the ones who walk away
With their capes pulled around them tight
Crying for the night
Cry for the nightbird tonight

[Verse 2]
The winter's really here now
And the blankets that I love
Sometimes I am surrounded by too much love

[Chorus]
And when I call, will you walk gently though my shadow?
It's the ones who sing at night
It's the ones who sing at night
The ones you dream of, the ones who walk away
With their capes pulled around them tight
Crying for the night
Cry for the nightbird tonight

And when I call, will you walk gently though my shadow?
It's the ones who sing at night

Cry for the nightbird tonight

And the darkened eyes, through the net of the lace
In the darkness, it's hard to see her face
Pulls back the net

I’m the American Dream
I’m the definition of white trash ballin’
I’m right back on 'em with a *err-chick-err, chicka-chick*
I can't call it, same shit, different toilet
Oh, you got a nice ass, darling
Can't wait to get you into my Benz, take you for a spin
What you mean we ain't fuckin'? You take me for a friend?
Let me tell you the whole story of Shady’s origin
You'll be sorry if you slam my Mercedes door again
Now, it all started with my father
I must've got my pimpin' genes from him
The way he left my momma
I'm a rolling stone, just like him, word to Johnny Drama
Keep my entourage with me, baby, I'll make a promise
There ain't nobody as bomb as
Me, I'm as calm as the breeze
I'm the bee's knees, his legs, and his arms
I'm a superstar, girl, I'm ready for you, mama
Why you think the only thing I got on is my pajamas?

First I'll kiss your navel, work my way down
Baby, you can lay down on the table
But you may wanna find somethin' more stable
I told you I ain't foolin' from the gate
This ain't the first day of April
But thank you for stayin', April
I'ma make you learn to appreciate me, differentiate me
From these phony, little fishy and sissy fake Gs
Skip over the ""huggy bear,"" and all the ""kissy face,"" please
Initiate phase three, missy, now service me
Take another shot of Jäger, shakin' so nervously
Take your time, baby, oh, you’re the bomb, baby
Oh, you’re doing that even better than your mom, lady
I told you why I’m Shady, you didn't listen now, did ya?
Relax, woman, you know that I’m only kiddin' with ya
Got a twisted sense of humor, it's warped, but I didn't hit ya
I think you’re finally startin' to get the picture, I’m just...

Call me dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, soul
I can hold you in the morning
But in the evening I gotta go
'Cause I'm on to the next girl
And the next girl I kind of like, oh

[Verse 3]
I got you caught up in the rapture, make you recapture
The feelings you had for your last boyfriend before he slapped ya
You never wanted someone so bad, you're
Sweatin', but if I’m what you wanted
Why’d you panic when I grabbed ya?
Girl, don't be so frantic, I’m just a hopeless romantic
Don't try to fight the feeling of somethin' that's so organic
You can’t ignore it, so don't, just stand before it
Just drop them panties to the floor, let’s get to camcordin'
Damn, shawty, I told you this was bound to happen
Soon as you wrote your number on the napkin
I was bound to work a number on your back
And throw your spine out of alignment
My love has got you so blind that
You couldn't pick Amy Winehouse out of a line-up
So stop at the store, pick a pint up
Let's get the pineapple Schnapps going, no one will knock
'Cause I'ma hang a sign up saying ""Don't Disturb""
Shawty, I'm so superb
I say the right things, don't I spit the dopest words?

But nobody it's me and my best friend with the lifelong vision eventually going platinum
So they laugh in my face and there's cash in my safe
See it's actually fake I'm on an Acura pace
And if you're down with always being surrounded by
Women who take shots 'til they feel nostalgic
Show me somebody truly happy and known in love

That I've been cheated on, and lied to

That it's been going on for some time now

And I'm breathless why I wonder
Weak one moment then the next I'm fine

I feel as if I'm falling
Every time I close my eyes
And flowing through my body
Is a river of surprise
Feelings are awakening
I hardly recognize as mine

What are all these new sensations
What's the secret they reveal
I'm not sure I understand
But I like the way I feel

Oh why why why why oh

Why is it that every time
I close my eyes he's there
The water shining on his skin
The sunlight in his hair
And all the while I'm thinking things
That I can never share with him

I'm a bundle of confusion
Yet it has a strange appeal
Did it all begin with him
And the way he makes me feel

Na, na, na, na, my nose runnin'
Got my shades over this
The whole skyline of the city's right in front of my face, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm in the zone this year, it's all fire nigga check my attire
Your worst fear is confirmed, your reign at the top expires this year
No application, I'm hired this year
This a dedication to that bitch who slashed my nigga tires, oh yeah
I knew about you, bitch I knew about you
Came up on a good nigga, he ain't have a clue about you
Tried to tell that nigga, don't trust that bitch as far as you can smell her, nigga
But you live and you learn
On these road to riches niggas bound to miss a few turns
Don't let the bridges that you cross turn into bridges you burn
You're bound to miss a few turns
Don't let the bridges that you.. fuck it you don't hear me
Look, ayo, I walk along this long harbor of life and sit on the piers
Reflect on my pain and shit on my fears
Should I feel an ounce of guilt that I outdid all my peers?
Or write my name in the sky and show them niggas I'm here?
This one is for the history books, picture me shook or failin'
This is revenge of the dreamer
Misery took a million of my niggas' hopes from 'em, don't even know some 'em
No more, the coke numbed 'em, no suicide notes from 'em
They killin' theyselves, slowly killin' they cells
Five iPhones dropped, my nigga still in the cell
He said he found God, shit, I doubt it, to each his own
Whatever keeps you strong to get up out it, we need you home
Cause see a war's goin' on outside, I 'bout cried
When that boy that the cops shot died, my mouth wide open from shock
Sick and tired of hopin' it'll stop
This pen the only hope that I got, I open up shop, and break out

[Chorus]
Got what you want, I got what you need
My heart on my sleeve, watch me bleed, I break out!
Dreamville is the team, my team iller than fiends
And ye' ain't real as you seem, and we can tell, nigga
Fuck what you think, cause if your shit don't stink
Nigga my shit won't sink, cause it can't, I break out!
I gotta break the fuck up outta here
Dreamville is the team, my team iller than fiends
And ye' ain't real as you seem, and we can tell, nigga

[Verse 2]
War stories, got tour stories
Pop-four-whores-on-the-top-floor stories
Niggas know, every verse is worth a brick of blow
Just a seven figure nigga got the game in figure four
I know at times I'm hypocritical, you niggas dig it though
I fuck until my dick be sore, leave bitches walkin' pigeon toe and break out!
On to the next bitch, homie
Your new chick—that's my ex-bitch, homie—in fact, I'm still logged in her Netflix, homie
Just make sure she cook you breakfast, homie
Her bacon slammin' but her eggs get runny—funny
So many bombs, you'd think Flex get money from me
Cole world but my neck get sunny
Now I don't fuck around with hoes from reality shows
Or blow-up dolls, 'cause I don't like havin' sex with dummies, love me
No disrespect meant, honey, this just a compilation of my observations
While trapped in this God-forsaken nation
Shit, but since we makin' conversation
I've been thinkin' me and you would make a bangin' combination
I know that you mad, I know what I said
But my dick be arguin' with my head, are you with the bed?
Well if so let's break out!

[Chorus]
Got what you want, I got what you need
My heart on my sleeve, watch me bleed, I break out!

And ye' ain't real as you seem, and we can tell, nigga
Fuck what you think, cause if your shit don't stink

Und fühlten sich gleich angemacht
Dabei schoss man am Horizont
Auf 99 Luftballons

99 Kriegsminister
Streichholz und Benzinkanister
Hielten sich für schlaue Leute
Witterten schon fette Beute
Riefen, „Krieg!“, und wollten Macht

Dass es einmal so weit kommt
Wegen 99 Luftballons

So now I wander through my days
And try to find my ways to the feelings that I felt

It leaves a taste that's bittersweet
That's called the blues, ooh

And if she did -- I wouldn't care. Let's ball

I change the rules and do what I wanna do
I'm in love with God, he's the only way

84,Sweetheart Like You,"[Verse 1]
Well, the pressure’s down, the boss ain't here
He gone North, for a while
They say that vanity got the best of him
But he sure left here in style
By the way, that’s a cute hat
And that smile’s so hard to resist
But what’s a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?

[Verse 2]
You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you
She wanted a whole man, not just a half
She used to call me sweet daddy when I was only a child
You kind of remind me of her when you laugh
In order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear
It’s done with a flick of the wrist
What’s a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?

[Verse 3]
You know, a woman like you should be at home
That’s where you belong
Watching out for someone who loves you true
Who would never do you wrong
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
Well, there’s no way to tell by that first kiss
What’s a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?

[Verse 4]
You know you can make a name for yourself
You can hear them tires squeal
You can be known as the most beautiful woman
Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal

[Verse 5]
You know, news of you has come down the line
Even before you came in the door
They say in your father’s house, there’s many mansions
Each one of them got a fireproof floor
Snap out of it, baby, people are jealous of you
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss
What’s a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?

[Verse 6]
Got to be an important person to be in here, honey
Got to have done some evil deed
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed

[Verse 7]
They say that patriotism is the last refuge
To which a scoundrel clings
Steal a little and they throw you in jail
Steal a lot and they make you king
There’s only one step down from here, baby
It’s called the land of permanent bliss
What’s a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?",Bob Dylan,1983,"[85, 85, 90]",3

Relight the fire
If only you would believe me
Lonely times, I've accepted with no choice
Wish that I had the comfort of your voice
Maybe we could take it over once again
Try to put love back on course and then
Everything would be so fine
For all of tiem I'll be yours
If you'd only just come back to me
I can't forget the way that it was
I know that yet there's something for us
My heart won't rest until I have you
Loneliness we share
Happiness we shared together
Loneliness we share
Let's try it again
I know I tried to make myself strong
I wish I knew just what's going on
I prayed all night just to be with you
All day long I am wondering what you fell (I'll never leave you)
Time goes on and without you it's too real
Maybe something that I say will touch your heart
It's all that I can do to make a start
Try to open up to me
And what I have just for you
Won't you come back
Just one more time (let's try again)
Baby come back
Just one more time

96,State Of The Union,"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, fellow Americans:

Fifty-one years ago, John F. Kennedy declared to this Chamber that ""the Constitution makes us not rivals for power but partners for progress. It is my task,"" he said, ""to report the State of the Union - to improve it is the task of us all.""

Tonight, thanks to the grit and determination of the American people, there is much progress to report. After a decade of grinding war, our brave men and women in uniform are coming home. After years of grueling recession, our businesses have created over six million new jobs. We buy more American cars than we have in five years, and less foreign oil than we have in twenty. Our housing market is healing, our stock market is rebounding, and consumers, patients, and homeowners enjoy stronger protections than ever before.

Together, we have cleared away the rubble of crisis, and can say with renewed confidence that the state of our union is stronger.

But we gather here knowing that there are millions of Americans whose hard work and dedication have not yet been rewarded. Our economy is adding jobs - but too many people still can't find full-time employment. Corporate profits have rocketed to all-time highs - but for more than a decade, wages and incomes have barely budged.

It is our generation's task, then, to reignite the true engine of America's economic growth - a rising, thriving middle class.

It is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country - the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can get ahead, no matter where you come from, what you look like, or who you love.

It is our unfinished task to make sure that this government works on behalf of the many, and not just the few; that it encourages free enterprise, rewards individual initiative, and opens the doors of opportunity to every child across this great nation.

The American people don't expect government to solve every problem. They don't expect those of us in this chamber to agree on every issue. But they do expect us to put the nation's interests before party. They do expect us to forge reasonable compromise where we can. For they know that America moves forward only when we do so together; and that the responsibility of improving this union remains the task of us all.

Our work must begin by making some basic decisions about our budget - decisions that will have a huge impact on the strength of our recovery.

Over the last few years, both parties have worked together to reduce the deficit by more than $2.5 trillion - mostly through spending cuts, but also by raising tax rates on the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. As a result, we are more than halfway towards the goal of $4 trillion in deficit reduction that economists say we need to stabilize our finances.

Now we need to finish the job. And the question is, how?

In 2011, Congress passed a law saying that if both parties couldn't agree on a plan to reach our deficit goal, about a trillion dollars' worth of budget cuts would automatically go into effect this year. These sudden, harsh, arbitrary cuts would jeopardize our military readiness. They'd devastate priorities like education, energy, and medical research. They would certainly slow our recovery, and cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs. That's why Democrats, Republicans, business leaders, and economists have already said that these cuts, known here in Washington as ""the sequester,"" are a really bad idea.

Now, some in this Congress have proposed preventing only the defense cuts by making even bigger cuts to things like education and job training; Medicare and Social Security benefits.

That idea is even worse. Yes, the biggest driver of our long-term debt is the rising cost of health care for an aging population. And those of us who care deeply about programs like Medicare must embrace the need for modest reforms - otherwise, our retirement programs will crowd out the investments we need for our children, and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement for future generations.

But we can't ask senior citizens and working families to shoulder the entire burden of deficit reduction while asking nothing more from the wealthiest and most powerful. We won't grow the middle class simply by shifting the cost of health care or college onto families that are already struggling, or by forcing communities to lay off more teachers, cops, and firefighters. Most Americans - Democrats, Republicans, and Independents - understand that we can't just cut our way to prosperity. They know that broad-based economic growth requires a balanced approach to deficit reduction, with spending cuts and revenue, and with everybody doing their fair share. And that's the approach I offer tonight.

On Medicare, I'm prepared to enact reforms that will achieve the same amount of health care savings by the beginning of the next decade as the reforms proposed by the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles commission. Already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs. The reforms I'm proposing go even further. We'll reduce taxpayer subsidies to prescription drug companies and ask more from the wealthiest seniors. We'll bring down costs by changing the way our government pays for Medicare, because our medical bills shouldn't be based on the number of tests ordered or days spent in the hospital - they should be based on the quality of care that our seniors receive. And I am open to additional reforms from both parties, so long as they don't violate the guarantee of a secure retirement. Our government shouldn't make promises we cannot keep - but we must keep the promises we've already made.

To hit the rest of our deficit reduction target, we should do what leaders in both parties have already suggested, and save hundreds of billions of dollars by getting rid of tax loopholes and deductions for the well-off and well-connected. After all, why would we choose to make deeper cuts to education and Medicare just to protect special interest tax breaks? How is that fair? How does that promote growth?

Now is our best chance for bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit. The American people deserve a tax code that helps small businesses spend less time filling out complicated forms, and more time expanding and hiring; a tax code that ensures billionaires with high-powered accountants can't pay a lower rate than their hard-working secretaries; a tax code that lowers incentives to move jobs overseas, and lowers tax rates for businesses and manufacturers that create jobs right here in America. That's what tax reform can deliver. That's what we can do together.

I realize that tax reform and entitlement reform won't be easy. The politics will be hard for both sides. None of us will get 100 percent of what we want. But the alternative will cost us jobs, hurt our economy, and visit hardship on millions of hardworking Americans. So let's set party interests aside, and work to pass a budget that replaces reckless cuts with smart savings and wise investments in our future. And let's do it without the brinksmanship that stresses consumers and scares off investors. The greatest nation on Earth cannot keep conducting its business by drifting from one manufactured crisis to the next. Let's agree, right here, right now, to keep the people's government open, pay our bills on time, and always uphold the full faith and credit of the United States of America. The American people have worked too hard, for too long, rebuilding from one crisis to see their elected officials cause another.

Now, most of us agree that a plan to reduce the deficit must be part of our agenda. But let's be clear: deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan. A growing economy that creates good, middle-class jobs - that must be the North Star that guides our efforts. Every day, we should ask ourselves three questions as a nation: How do we attract more jobs to our shores? How do we equip our people with the skills needed to do those jobs? And how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living?

A year and a half ago, I put forward an American Jobs Act that independent economists said would create more than one million new jobs. I thank the last Congress for passing some of that agenda, and I urge this Congress to pass the rest. Tonight, I'll lay out additional proposals that are fully paid for and fully consistent with the budget framework both parties agreed to just 18 months ago. Let me repeat - nothing I'm proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime. It's not a bigger government we need, but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad-based growth.

Our first priority is making America a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing.

After shedding jobs for more than 10 years, our manufacturers have added about 500,000 jobs over the past three. Caterpillar is bringing jobs back from Japan. Ford is bringing jobs back from Mexico. After locating plants in other countries like China, Intel is opening its most advanced plant right here at home. And this year, Apple will start making Macs in America again.

There are things we can do, right now, to accelerate this trend. Last year, we created our first manufacturing innovation institute in Youngstown, Ohio. A once-shuttered warehouse is now a state-of-the art lab where new workers are mastering the 3D printing that has the potential to revolutionize the way we make almost everything. There's no reason this can't happen in other towns. So tonight, I'm announcing the launch of three more of these manufacturing hubs, where businesses will partner with the Departments of Defense and Energy to turn regions left behind by globalization into global centers of high-tech jobs. And I ask this Congress to help create a network of fifteen of these hubs and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is Made in America.

If we want to make the best products, we also have to invest in the best ideas. Every dollar we invested to map the human genome returned $140 to our economy. Today, our scientists are mapping the human brain to unlock the answers to Alzheimer's; developing drugs to regenerate damaged organs; devising new material to make batteries ten times more powerful. Now is not the time to gut these job-creating investments in science and innovation. Now is the time to reach a level of research and development not seen since the height of the Space Race. And today, no area holds more promise than our investments in American energy.

After years of talking about it, we are finally poised to control our own energy future. We produce more oil at home than we have in 15 years. We have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas, and the amount of renewable energy we generate from sources like wind and solar - with tens of thousands of good, American jobs to show for it. We produce more natural gas than ever before - and nearly everyone's energy bill is lower because of it. And over the last four years, our emissions of the dangerous carbon pollution that threatens our planet have actually fallen.

But for the sake of our children and our future, we must do more to combat climate change. Yes, it's true that no single event makes a trend. But the fact is, the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15. Heat waves, droughts, wildfires, and floods - all are now more frequent and intense. We can choose to believe that Superstorm Sandy, and the most severe drought in decades, and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence. Or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science - and act before it's too late.

The good news is, we can make meaningful progress on this issue while driving strong economic growth. I urge this Congress to pursue a bipartisan, market-based solution to climate change, like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few years ago. But if Congress won't act soon to protect future generations, I will. I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take, now and in the future, to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy.

Four years ago, other countries dominated the clean energy market and the jobs that came with it. We've begun to change that. Last year, wind energy added nearly half of all new power capacity in America. So let's generate even more. Solar energy gets cheaper by the year - so let's drive costs down even further. As long as countries like China keep going all-in on clean energy, so must we.

In the meantime, the natural gas boom has led to cleaner power and greater energy independence. That's why my Administration will keep cutting red tape and speeding up new oil and gas permits. But I also want to work with this Congress to encourage the research and technology that helps natural gas burn even cleaner and protects our air and water.

Indeed, much of our new-found energy is drawn from lands and waters that we, the public, own together. So tonight, I propose we use some of our oil and gas revenues to fund an Energy Security Trust that will drive new research and technology to shift our cars and trucks off oil for good. If a non-partisan coalition of CEOs and retired generals and admirals can get behind this idea, then so can we. Let's take their advice and free our families and businesses from the painful spikes in gas prices we've put up with for far too long. I'm also issuing a new goal for America: let's cut in half the energy wasted by our homes and businesses over the next twenty years. The states with the best ideas to create jobs and lower energy bills by constructing more efficient buildings will receive federal support to help make it happen.

America's energy sector is just one part of an aging infrastructure badly in need of repair. Ask any CEO where they'd rather locate and hire: a country with deteriorating roads and bridges, or one with high-speed rail and internet; high-tech schools and self-healing power grids. The CEO of Siemens America - a company that brought hundreds of new jobs to North Carolina - has said that if we upgrade our infrastructure, they'll bring even more jobs. And I know that you want these job-creating projects in your districts. I've seen you all at the ribbon-cuttings.

Tonight, I propose a ""Fix-It-First"" program to put people to work as soon as possible on our most urgent repairs, like the nearly 70,000 structurally deficient bridges across the country. And to make sure taxpayers don't shoulder the whole burden, I'm also proposing a Partnership to Rebuild America that attracts private capital to upgrade what our businesses need most: modern ports to move our goods; modern pipelines to withstand a storm; modern schools worthy of our children. Let's prove that there is no better place to do business than the United States of America. And let's start right away.

Part of our rebuilding effort must also involve our housing sector. Today, our housing market is finally healing from the collapse of 2007. Home prices are rising at the fastest pace in six years, home purchases are up nearly 50 percent, and construction is expanding again.

But even with mortgage rates near a 50-year low, too many families with solid credit who want to buy a home are being rejected. Too many families who have never missed a payment and want to refinance are being told no. That's holding our entire economy back, and we need to fix it. Right now, there's a bill in this Congress that would give every responsible homeowner in America the chance to save $3,000 a year by refinancing at today's rates. Democrats and Republicans have supported it before. What are we waiting for? Take a vote, and send me that bill. Right now, overlapping regulations keep responsible young families from buying their first home. What's holding us back? Let's streamline the process, and help our economy grow.

These initiatives in manufacturing, energy, infrastructure, and housing will help entrepreneurs and small business owners expand and create new jobs. But none of it will matter unless we also equip our citizens with the skills and training to fill those jobs. And that has to start at the earliest possible age.

Study after study shows that the sooner a child begins learning, the better he or she does down the road. But today, fewer than 3 in 10 four year-olds are enrolled in a high-quality preschool program. Most middle-class parents can't afford a few hundred bucks a week for private preschool. And for poor kids who need help the most, this lack of access to preschool education can shadow them for the rest of their lives.

Tonight, I propose working with states to make high-quality preschool available to every child in America. Every dollar we invest in high-quality early education can save more than seven dollars later on - by boosting graduation rates, reducing teen pregnancy, even reducing violent crime. In states that make it a priority to educate our youngest children, like Georgia or Oklahoma, studies show students grow up more likely to read and do math at grade level, graduate high school, hold a job, and form more stable families of their own. So let's do what works, and make sure none of our children start the race of life already behind. Let's give our kids that chance.

Let's also make sure that a high school diploma puts our kids on a path to a good job. Right now, countries like Germany focus on graduating their high school students with the equivalent of a technical degree from one of our community colleges, so that they're ready for a job. At schools like P-Tech in Brooklyn, a collaboration between New York Public Schools, the City University of New York, and IBM, students will graduate with a high school diploma and an associate degree in computers or engineering.

We need to give every American student opportunities like this. Four years ago, we started Race to the Top - a competition that convinced almost every state to develop smarter curricula and higher standards, for about 1 percent of what we spend on education each year. Tonight, I'm announcing a new challenge to redesign America's high schools so they better equip graduates for the demands of a high-tech economy. We'll reward schools that develop new partnerships with colleges and employers, and create classes that focus on science, technology, engineering, and math - the skills today's employers are looking for to fill jobs right now and in the future.

Now, even with better high schools, most young people will need some higher education. It's a simple fact: the more education you have, the more likely you are to have a job and work your way into the middle class. But today, skyrocketing costs price way too many young people out of a higher education, or saddle them with unsustainable debt.

Through tax credits, grants, and better loans, we have made college more affordable for millions of students and families over the last few years. But taxpayers cannot continue to subsidize the soaring cost of higher education. Colleges must do their part to keep costs down, and it's our job to make sure they do. Tonight, I ask Congress to change the Higher Education Act, so that affordability and value are included in determining which colleges receive certain types of federal aid. And tomorrow, my Administration will release a new ""College Scorecard"" that parents and students can use to compare schools based on a simple criteria: where you can get the most bang for your educational buck.

To grow our middle class, our citizens must have access to the education and training that today's jobs require. But we also have to make sure that America remains a place where everyone who's willing to work hard has the chance to get ahead.

Our economy is stronger when we harness the talents and ingenuity of striving, hopeful immigrants. And right now, leaders from the business, labor, law enforcement, and faith communities all agree that the time has come to pass comprehensive immigration reform.

Real reform means strong border security, and we can build on the progress my Administration has already made - putting more boots on the southern border than at any time in our history, and reducing illegal crossings to their lowest levels in 40 years.

Real reform means establishing a responsible pathway to earned citizenship - a path that includes passing a background check, paying taxes and a meaningful penalty, learning English, and going to the back of the line behind the folks trying to come here legally.

And real reform means fixing the legal immigration system to cut waiting periods, reduce bureaucracy, and attract the highly-skilled entrepreneurs and engineers that will help create jobs and grow our economy.

In other words, we know what needs to be done. As we speak, bipartisan groups in both chambers are working diligently to draft a bill, and I applaud their efforts. Now let's get this done. Send me a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the next few months, and I will sign it right away.

But we can't stop there. We know our economy is stronger when our wives, mothers, and daughters can live their lives free from discrimination in the workplace, and free from the fear of domestic violence. Today, the Senate passed the Violence Against Women Act that Joe Biden originally wrote almost 20 years ago. I urge the House to do the same. And I ask this Congress to declare that women should earn a living equal to their efforts, and finally pass the Paycheck Fairness Act this year.

We know our economy is stronger when we reward an honest day's work with honest wages. But today, a full-time worker making the minimum wage earns $14,500 a year. Even with the tax relief we've put in place, a family with two kids that earns the minimum wage still lives below the poverty line. That's wrong. That's why, since the last time this Congress raised the minimum wage, nineteen states have chosen to bump theirs even higher.

Tonight, let's declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth, no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty, and raise the federal minimum wage to $9.00 an hour. This single step would raise the incomes of millions of working families. It could mean the difference between groceries or the food bank; rent or eviction; scraping by or finally getting ahead. For businesses across the country, it would mean customers with more money in their pockets. In fact, working folks shouldn't have to wait year after year for the minimum wage to go up while CEO pay has never been higher. So here's an idea that Governor Romney and I actually agreed on last year: let's tie the minimum wage to the cost of living, so that it finally becomes a wage you can live on.

Tonight, let's also recognize that there are communities in this country where no matter how hard you work, it's virtually impossible to get ahead. Factory towns decimated from years of plants packing up. Inescapable pockets of poverty, urban and rural, where young adults are still fighting for their first job. America is not a place where chance of birth or circumstance should decide our destiny. And that is why we need to build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class for all who are willing to climb them.

Let's offer incentives to companies that hire Americans who've got what it takes to fill that job opening, but have been out of work so long that no one will give them a chance. Let's put people back to work rebuilding vacant homes in run-down neighborhoods. And this year, my Administration will begin to partner with 20 of the hardest-hit towns in America to get these communities back on their feet. We'll work with local leaders to target resources at public safety, education, and housing. We'll give new tax credits to businesses that hire and invest. And we'll work to strengthen families by removing the financial deterrents to marriage for low-income couples, and doing more to encourage fatherhood - because what makes you a man isn't the ability to conceive a child; it's having the courage to raise one.

Stronger families. Stronger communities. A stronger America. It is this kind of prosperity - broad, shared, and built on a thriving middle class - that has always been the source of our progress at home. It is also the foundation of our power and influence throughout the world.

Tonight, we stand united in saluting the troops and civilians who sacrifice every day to protect us. Because of them, we can say with confidence that America will complete its mission in Afghanistan, and achieve our objective of defeating the core of al Qaeda. Already, we have brought home 33,000 of our brave servicemen and women. This spring, our forces will move into a support role, while Afghan security forces take the lead. Tonight, I can announce that over the next year, another 34,000 American troops will come home from Afghanistan. This drawdown will continue. And by the end of next year, our war in Afghanistan will be over.

Beyond 2014, America's commitment to a unified and sovereign Afghanistan will endure, but the nature of our commitment will change. We are negotiating an agreement with the Afghan government that focuses on two missions: training and equipping Afghan forces so that the country does not again slip into chaos, and counter-terrorism efforts that allow us to pursue the remnants of al Qaeda and their affiliates.

Today, the organization that attacked us on 9/11 is a shadow of its former self. Different al Qaeda affiliates and extremist groups have emerged - from the Arabian Peninsula to Africa. The threat these groups pose is evolving. But to meet this threat, we don't need to send tens of thousands of our sons and daughters abroad, or occupy other nations. Instead, we will need to help countries like Yemen, Libya, and Somalia provide for their own security, and help allies who take the fight to terrorists, as we have in Mali. And, where necessary, through a range of capabilities, we will continue to take direct action against those terrorists who pose the gravest threat to Americans.

As we do, we must enlist our values in the fight. That is why my Administration has worked tirelessly to forge a durable legal and policy framework to guide our counterterrorism operations. Throughout, we have kept Congress fully informed of our efforts. I recognize that in our democracy, no one should just take my word that we're doing things the right way. So, in the months ahead, I will continue to engage with Congress to ensure not only that our targeting, detention, and prosecution of terrorists remains consistent with our laws and system of checks and balances, but that our efforts are even more transparent to the American people and to the world.

Of course, our challenges don't end with al Qaeda. America will continue to lead the effort to prevent the spread of the world's most dangerous weapons. The regime in North Korea must know that they will only achieve security and prosperity by meeting their international obligations. Provocations of the sort we saw last night will only isolate them further, as we stand by our allies, strengthen our own missile defense, and lead the world in taking firm action in response to these threats.

Likewise, the leaders of Iran must recognize that now is the time for a diplomatic solution, because a coalition stands united in demanding that they meet their obligations, and we will do what is necessary to prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon. At the same time, we will engage Russia to seek further reductions in our nuclear arsenals, and continue leading the global effort to secure nuclear materials that could fall into the wrong hands - because our ability to influence others depends on our willingness to lead.

America must also face the rapidly growing threat from cyber-attacks. We know hackers steal people's identities and infiltrate private e-mail. We know foreign countries and companies swipe our corporate secrets. Now our enemies are also seeking the ability to sabotage our power grid, our financial institutions, and our air traffic control systems. We cannot look back years from now and wonder why we did nothing in the face of real threats to our security and our economy.

That's why, earlier today, I signed a new executive order that will strengthen our cyber defenses by increasing information sharing, and developing standards to protect our national security, our jobs, and our privacy. Now, Congress must act as well, by passing legislation to give our government a greater capacity to secure our networks and deter attacks.

Even as we protect our people, we should remember that today's world presents not only dangers, but opportunities. To boost American exports, support American jobs, and level the playing field in the growing markets of Asia, we intend to complete negotiations on a Trans-Pacific Partnership. And tonight, I am announcing that we will launch talks on a comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union - because trade that is free and fair across the Atlantic supports millions of good-paying American jobs.

We also know that progress in the most impoverished parts of our world enriches us all. In many places, people live on little more than a dollar a day. So the United States will join with our allies to eradicate such extreme poverty in the next two decades: by connecting more people to the global economy and empowering women; by giving our young and brightest minds new opportunities to serve and helping communities to feed, power, and educate themselves; by saving the world's children from preventable deaths; and by realizing the promise of an AIDS-free generation.

Above all, America must remain a beacon to all who seek freedom during this period of historic change. I saw the power of hope last year in Rangoon - when Aung San Suu Kyi welcomed an American President into the home where she had been imprisoned for years; when thousands of Burmese lined the streets, waving American flags, including a man who said, ""There is justice and law in the United States. I want our country to be like that.""

In defense of freedom, we will remain the anchor of strong alliances from the Americas to Africa; from Europe to Asia. In the Middle East, we will stand with citizens as they demand their universal rights, and support stable transitions to democracy. The process will be messy, and we cannot presume to dictate the course of change in countries like Egypt; but we can - and will - insist on respect for the fundamental rights of all people. We will keep the pressure on a Syrian regime that has murdered its own people, and support opposition leaders that respect the rights of every Syrian. And we will stand steadfast with Israel in pursuit of security and a lasting peace. These are the messages I will deliver when I travel to the Middle East next month.

All this work depends on the courage and sacrifice of those who serve in dangerous places at great personal risk - our diplomats, our intelligence officers, and the men and women of the United States Armed Forces. As long as I'm Commander-in-Chief, we will do whatever we must to protect those who serve their country abroad, and we will maintain the best military in the world. We will invest in new capabilities, even as we reduce waste and wartime spending. We will ensure equal treatment for all service members, and equal benefits for their families - gay and straight. We will draw upon the courage and skills of our sisters and daughters, because women have proven under fire that they are ready for combat. We will keep faith with our veterans - investing in world-class care, including mental health care, for our wounded warriors; supporting our military families; and giving our veterans the benefits, education, and job opportunities they have earned. And I want to thank my wife Michelle and Dr. Jill Biden for their continued dedication to serving our military families as well as they serve us.

But defending our freedom is not the job of our military alone. We must all do our part to make sure our God-given rights are protected here at home. That includes our most fundamental right as citizens: the right to vote. When any Americans - no matter where they live or what their party - are denied that right simply because they can't wait for five, six, seven hours just to cast their ballot, we are betraying our ideals. That's why, tonight, I'm announcing a non-partisan commission to improve the voting experience in America. And I'm asking two long-time experts in the field, who've recently served as the top attorneys for my campaign and for Governor Romney's campaign, to lead it. We can fix this, and we will. The American people demand it. And so does our democracy.

Of course, what I've said tonight matters little if we don't come together to protect our most precious resource - our children.

It has been two months since Newtown. I know this is not the first time this country has debated how to reduce gun violence. But this time is different. Overwhelming majorities of Americans - Americans who believe in the 2nd Amendment - have come together around commonsense reform - like background checks that will make it harder for criminals to get their hands on a gun. Senators of both parties are working together on tough new laws to prevent anyone from buying guns for resale to criminals. Police chiefs are asking our help to get weapons of war and massive ammunition magazines off our streets, because they are tired of being outgunned.

Each of these proposals deserves a vote in Congress. If you want to vote no, that's your choice. But these proposals deserve a vote. Because in the two months since Newtown, more than a thousand birthdays, graduations, and anniversaries have been stolen from our lives by a bullet from a gun.

One of those we lost was a young girl named Hadiya Pendleton. She was 15 years old. She loved Fig Newtons and lip gloss. She was a majorette. She was so good to her friends, they all thought they were her best friend. Just three weeks ago, she was here, in Washington, with her classmates, performing for her country at my inauguration. And a week later, she was shot and killed in a Chicago park after school, just a mile away from my house.

Hadiya's parents, Nate and Cleo, are in this chamber tonight, along with more than two dozen Americans whose lives have been torn apart by gun violence. They deserve a vote.

Gabby Giffords deserves a vote.

The families of Newtown deserve a vote.

The families of Aurora deserve a vote.

The families of Oak Creek, and Tucson, and Blacksburg, and the countless other communities ripped open by gun violence - they deserve a simple vote.

Our actions will not prevent every senseless act of violence in this country. Indeed, no laws, no initiatives, no administrative acts will perfectly solve all the challenges I've outlined tonight. But we were never sent here to be perfect. We were sent here to make what difference we can, to secure this nation, expand opportunity, and uphold our ideals through the hard, often frustrating, but absolutely necessary work of self-government.

We were sent here to look out for our fellow Americans the same way they look out for one another, every single day, usually without fanfare, all across this country. We should follow their example.

We should follow the example of a New York City nurse named Menchu Sanchez. When Hurricane Sandy plunged her hospital into darkness, her thoughts were not with how her own home was faring - they were with the twenty precious newborns in her care and the rescue plan she devised that kept them all safe.

We should follow the example of a North Miami woman named Desiline Victor. When she arrived at her polling place, she was told the wait to vote might be six hours. And as time ticked by, her concern was not with her tired body or aching feet, but whether folks like her would get to have their say. Hour after hour, a throng of people stayed in line in support of her. Because Desiline is 102 years old. And they erupted in cheers when she finally put on a sticker that read ""I Voted.""

We should follow the example of a police officer named Brian Murphy. When a gunman opened fire on a Sikh temple in Wisconsin, and Brian was the first to arrive, he did not consider his own safety. He fought back until help arrived, and ordered his fellow officers to protect the safety of the Americans worshiping inside - even as he lay bleeding from twelve bullet wounds.

When asked how he did that, Brian said, ""That's just the way we're made.""

That's just the way we're made.

We may do different jobs, and wear different uniforms, and hold different views than the person beside us. But as Americans, we all share the same proud title:

We are citizens. It's a word that doesn't just describe our nationality or legal status. It describes the way we're made. It describes what we believe. It captures the enduring idea that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations; that our rights are wrapped up in the rights of others; and that well into our third century as a nation, it remains the task of us all, as citizens of these United States, to be the authors of the next great chapter in our American story.

Now we're over here and you're next to me
You look at me, I find it hard to speak
I start to laugh and you do the same
I look at you, you smile again
Your hand holdin on to mine
The thoughts running through my mind
I try not to let it show
I've fall and then you look in my eyes

Oh you so sweet
It was meant to be
While you're here with me
I wanna know you more
Hold you more
Kiss you till there's no more
Love the way you walk
Love it when you talk
My feelings so so deep
Every night I can't sleep
De-li-ri-ous from my head to my feet
De-li-ri-ous is what I can see
Something serious when it comes to you (yeah)

99,How Many Times Can We Say Goodbye,"Here we are so close to the end now
Still holdin' on, we try and pretend now
Clinging to love we both know is dying {It's dying}
We've tried and tried to find us a way out
But darling, our dreams have now all been played out
Still we go on hopelessly trying

But how many times can we say goodbye
And how many times can we see love die
And how many times can we give it one more try
Before we really say goodbye
Mmm, goodbye {Goodbye}

We're so in love, but wrong for each other
Each hurt that heals brings on another
Both of us used and both of us using {Hey, hey}
Darling, it's time that we stop pretending (Stop)
There's just no way to rewrite our ending (No way)
We're caught in this game and we both know we're losing

Oh, but how many times can we say goodbye
Hey, how many times can we feel love die
Tell me how many times can we give it one more try {One more}
Before we really say goodbye
Yeah...oh...ho... (Whoa...oh...oh...)

How many times can we break up and make up
Both of our hearts refusing to wake up
Just can't go on {No} and on living a lie
Though I'll always love you

How many times (Ooh) can we say goodbye
Oh...and how many times can we live this lie
Hey, how many times can we give it one more try (One more try)

But now I know, yourself is all you wanna see

Better than a mirror can, no
Mirror man, I'll make it easier

And trouble's coming for you

[Post-Chorus]
Mirror man (mirror man)
Wish I could love you better than a mirror can!

You would say that I'm your only one
But I would tell you to walk before you run

Guess I'm attracted to the kind that let me down

Better than a mirror can, no

I heard that it's hazardous stormin' outside, let's do that on the mattress
I just keep askin, is it real, is it real? Look, tell me, is it real?
Yep, real enough to go and get it tatted
Give you flowers, now you look like you're on a pageant
I can take you to the crib, condo, or the cabin, what's up?
If you make it, I can make it happen, I can grant it
Don't you take my ""grant it"" though for granted
I know that's not your intent, we ain't even campin'
And to leave this bed I'mma need a fuckin' ransom

Some Senator was squawking 'bout the bad economy

There's a local paper rolled up in a rubber band
One more sad stories, one more than I can stand
Just once how I'd like to see the headline say
Not much to print today, can't find nothing bad to say
Because

Nobody robbed a liquor store on the lower part of town
Nobody OD'd, nobody burned a single building down
Nobody fired a shot in anger, nobody had to die in vain
We sure could use a little good news today

I'll come home this evening I'll bet that the news will be the same
Somebody takes a hostage, somebody steals a plane
How I wanna hear the anchorman talk about a county fair
And how we cleaned up the air, how everybody learned to care
Whoa, tell me

Nobody was assassinated in the whole Third World today
And in the streets of Ireland all the children had to do was play
And everybody loves everybody in the good old USA

I have never been type who realised
What I had done until you left me hanging
How I would be panicking when you was sad
And went and had your fantasies of happy marriages
And sadly I don't believe in leavin
Neither me or you was on the virge of feelin lost
But mistook you for a fucking reason, breathin heavy
Feelin sleezy for the pain I brought
But I never cheated so it doesn't seem
Like it's a reason for you to walk off at all
But it's easy when i'm feelin really beaten
Now that you have weakened every fucking thought
I had never met somebody like you and despite
What you was hiding I was so in love
But I guess relationships are just a cycle
Of an endless fight, and it's enough...

[Chorus: Gus Black]
Love
Love is a stranger
I know that it's hard
I know what it's like

Love
You don't need a saviour
To someone who'll fight
With you by your side

[Verse 2: Anxious]
As the time went by, we tried to find a sign
Of why we even should remain together
Our relationship was built on lies and we were blind
But kept in mind it's hard to find another
It had been forever since we both were single
And I hate to mingle so I tried to work it out
Never did I think a tingle could make me rethink
Something that I was sure about
But it did and it was like I started to notice
Some things that I had never seen before
But I hid my feelings as we argued, cuz I knew
What you was like and I don't need it 'more
But couldn't keep it cool so I told you how I felt
And I barely got shit
Well fuck you then, I'm better off alone
And I don't need you in my fucking life bitch!

[Chorus: Gus Black]
Love
We live in a wasteland
People lie to your face
Fucking lie to your face

Love
Don't be a stranger
I know this is hard
'Cause I know what I'm like
Inside

[Verse 3: Anxious]
Tried to let her go, it's fucking terrible
The shits unbearable, and I don't wanna feel
Like i'm an animal, our love was chemical
So fucking sensual and now you wanna leave
Breathin heavy, feelin empty
Since you left me cuz I didn't give enough
But if you would let me, I can bet on everything
That I would fight to make you feel like you was loved
But you had decided that you wanted to find another
Path in life so went on and left me
Feelin violent cuz of all the lies and everytime
I died a bit and now i'm dead bitch
So why would I just let you go and leave me
Here alone with things that you have done too
Hope you know what I was amining for
But before we go, I hope you now I loved you...

And it dies, dies, dies this time

How is it possible
To still believe what never could be true?
I'm standing here naked and afraid
But there's no redemption
For the kind of sins that fester in your brain
You'll always be the king of pain

I had to learn to play the part
It gonna hurt before it starts

Darling, I'm sorry for the shit I gave you
Darling, I'm sorry for the fears that made you
All the money in the world couldn't save you
But I tried, I tried, I tried
Oh, darling, it's over and I don't need you
Honey, life's cruel and it will tease you
It's your ego that will defeat you
And it dies, dies, dies this time

You got a million in your hand
You got a million in your hand
You got a billion in the bank
But a bag full of stones

Darling, I'm sorry for the shit I gave you
Darling, I'm sorry for the fears that made you
All the women in the world couldn't save you
But I tried, I tried, I tried
Oh, darling, it's over and I don't need you
Honey, life's cruel and it will tease you
It's your ego that will defeat you

112,If Anyone Falls,"[Verse 1]
I hear a voice in the room next to mine
Feels good, sounds good
Closes the door from behind
And then another voice comes through the door
I am dealing with a man
When away from me, stays deep inside my heart
And, he says, ""If anyone falls in love, it will be one of us.""

[Chorus]
If anyone falls in love
Somewhere in the twilight, dream time
Somewhere in the back of your mind
If anyone falls

[Verse 2]
And I heard someone say
As my eyes turned away, he said, ""I have loved many women
I have many times run away.""
Ooh, I have never known the words
Well, I have tried to be true
But I have never known what to say, how to say
Seen anything today
I've never seen anything like you

[Chorus]
If anyone falls in love
Somewhere in the twilight, dream time
Somewhere in the back of your mind
If anyone falls

[Bridge]
So, I'm never gonna see you (Never gonna see you)
Deep inside my heart
But I see your shadow against, shadow against
Shadow against the wall
Baby, I see your shadow against the wall

[Verse 3]
I hear a voice in the room next to mine
Feels good, sounds good
Closes the door from behind
And then another voice comes through the door
Ooh, I am dealing with a man
When away from me, stays deep inside my heart
And, he says, ""If anyone falls in love, it will be done to us.""

[Chorus]
If anyone falls in love (Anyone)
Somewhere in the twilight, dream time
Somewhere in the back of your mind (Back of your mind)

My whole squad kept the kid in the cut
Keep your strap 'cause these niggas play tough
Pick and chose who the right one to trust
Pick and chose who the right one to trust
Keep it real it's a lot fake love
Niggas hate but they bitches in love
And the Bentley all white like a dove

I'm a sipper, can tell when it's cut
You can't tell me that she ain't a slut

New agenda, don't do nothin' free
Ain't not one of my foreigns on E
All my bitches got expensive weave
I sip drank for my pain to get eased
I still talk to the Lord on my knees
Helpin' me take care all of my needs
And we take off the top for a breeze

It's her first night on the town since she was just eighteen
A lady down on love and out of hope and dreams
The ties that once bound her now are broke away
And she's like a baby, just learning how to play
She never thought that love could ever end so soon
Her mind drifts back in time to a mid-summer moon
When he asked her to marry and she gladly said okay
And a woman came to be from the girl of yesterday

[Chorus]
Now, she's a lady down on love
She needs somebody to gently pick her up
She's got her freedom, but she'd rather be bound
To a man who would love her and never let her down

[Verse 2]
Well, I know a lady that's down on her love
'Cause I used to hold her and have that special touch
But work took me a way from home late at nights
And I wasn't there when she turned out the lights
Then both of us got lonely and I gave into lust
And she just couldn't live with a man she couldn't trust

125,Automatic Man,"[Verse 1]
He's the latest superhero with powers so profound
He can leap a dotted line in just a single bound
I know you must have seen him in the books and magazines
He's the quintessential mindless modern episcene
His life is meaningful because he gets things done
Bang bang he's dead, chalk up another triumph for our hero
The Automatic Man

[Verse 2]
It's true you must have met him, he's your best friend and your foe
His opinions are determined by the status quo
A true creature of habit, he smokes three packs a day
When he has an original thought, he forgets it right away
He's the automatic man!
He's a paradigm of carefree living
He's our mentor, disturb him if you can
He's the answer if your peace of mind is lacking
He's our savior, he is the common man
So if you are troubled by the daily bump and grind
Then take a careful look around and brother you will find...

126,Tell Her About It,"[Verse 1]
Listen boy don't want to see you
Let a good thing slip away
You know I don't like watching anybody make
The same mistakes that I made
She's a real nice girl
And she's always there for you
But a nice girl wouldn't tell you what you should do

[Verse 2]
Listen boy I'm sure that you think
You got it all under control
You don't want somebody telling you
The way to stay in someone's soul
You're a big boy now
And you'll never let her go
But that's just the kind of thing she ought to know

[Chorus 1]
Tell her about it
Tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason to accept
That you're for real
Tell her about it
Tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her
Let her know how much she means

[Verse 3]
Listen boy it's not automatically
A certain guarantee
To insure yourself you've got to provide
Communication constantly
When you love someone
You're always insecure
And there's only one good way to reassure

[Chorus 2]
Tell her about it
Let her know how much you care
When she can't be with you
Tell her you wish you were there
Tell her about it
Every day before you leave
Pay her some attention
Give her something to believe

[Verse 4]
Cause now and then she'll get to worrying
Just because you haven't spoken for so long
Though you may not have done anything
Will that be a consolation when she's gone?

[Verse 5]
Listen boy it's good information
From a man who's made mistakes
Just a word or two that she gets from you
Could be the difference that it makes
She's a trusting soul
She's put her trust in you
But a girl like that won't tell you what you should do

[Chorus 1]
Tell her about it
Tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason to accept
That you're for real
Tell her about it
Tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her
Let her know how much she means

[Outro]
Tell her about it
Tell her how you feel right now
Just tell her about it
The girl don't want to wait too long
You got to tell her about it
Tell her now that you won't go wrong
You got to tell her about it
Before it gets too late
You've got to tell her about it
You know the girl don't want to wait
You got to tell her about it
You got to tell, tell, tell her about it
Now, tell her about it",Billy Joel,1983,"[92, 71, 64, 27, 21, 13, 9, 7, 2, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12, 22, 27, 29, 38]",18

Just take those old records off the shelf
I'll sit and listen to 'em by myself

Don't try to take me to a disco
You'll never even get me out on the floor
In ten minutes I'll be late for the door
I like that old time rock'n' roll

[Chorus]
Still like that old time rock'n' roll
That kind of music just soothes the soul
I reminisce about the days of old
With that old time rock 'n' roll

[Verse 2]
Won't go to hear them play a tango
I'd rather hear some blues or funky old soul
There's only sure way to get me to go
Start playing old time rock 'n' roll
Call me a relic, call me what you will
Say I'm old-fashioned, say I'm over the hill
Today' music ain't got the same soul
I like that old time rock 'n' roll

People always talking ‘bout ""reputation""

We got a theory
You see, Mike, we got a theory
About magic, and miracles
[Shaggy 2 Dope] That's right, that's right

[Verse 1]
[VJ] If magic is all we've ever known
Then it's easy to miss what really goes on
But I've seen miracles in every way
[S2D] And I see miracles every day
Oceans spanning beyond my sight
[VJ] And a million stars way above 'em at night
We don't have to be high to look in the sky
And know that's a miracle opened wide
[S2D] Look at the mountains, trees, the seven seas
[VJ] And everything chilling underwater, please!
Hot lava, snow, rain and fog
[S2D] Long neck giraffes, pet cats and dogs
[VJ] And I've seen eighty-five thousand people
All in one room, together as equal
[S2D] Pure magic is the birth of my kids
I've seen shit that'll shock your eyelids
[VJ] The sun and the moon, and even Mars
[S2D] The Milky Way and fucking shooting stars
[VJ] UFOs
[S2D] a river flows
[VJ] Plant a little seed and nature grows
[S2D] Niagara Falls and the pyramids
[VJ] Everything you believed in as kids
[S2D] Fucking rainbows, after it rains
There's enough miracles here to blow your brains
[VJ] I fed a fish to a pelican at Frisco Bay
It tried to eat my cell phone, [S2D] he ran away
[VJ] And music is magic, pure and clean
You can feel it and hear it but it can't be seen

You can't even hold it
(Do you notice and recognize miracles?)
It's just there in the air

And it fills the room from the floor to the ceiling
[S2D] I see miracles all around me
Stop and look around, it's all astounding

[S2D] Fucking magnets, how do they work?
And I don't wanna talk to a scientist
Y'all motherfuckers lying, and getting me pissed
[VJ] Solar eclipse, and vicious weather
[S2D] Fifteen thousand Juggalos together
[VJ] And I love my mom, for giving me this
Time on this planet, taking nothing for granted
I seen a caterpillar turn into a butterfly
[S2D] Miracles ain't nothing to lie
[VJ] Shaggy's little boys look just like Shaggy
And my little boy looks just like daddy
[S2D] Miracles each and everywhere you look
And nobody has to stay where they put
This world is yours, for you to explore
[VJ] It's nothing but miracles beyond your door
The Dark Carnival is your invitation
[S2D] To witness that without explanation
[VJ] Take a look at this fine creation
[S2D] And enjoy it better with appreciation
[VJ] Crows, ghosts, [S2D] the midnight coast
[VJ] The wonders of the world, [S2D] mysteries the most
[VJ] Just open your mind, and it ain't no way
[S2D] To ignore the miracles of every day

Swept away --

Its passion will ride, as the cities fly by
And the tail-lights dissolve, in the coming of night
And the questions in thousands take flight

The eyes that just stare, and the glance at the clock
And the secret that burns, and the pain that won't stop
And its fuel is the years
Leading me on - leading me down the road
Driving beyond
Driving me down the road

My love is exceeding the limit
Red-eyed and fevered with the hum of the miles
Distance and longing, my thoughts do collide
Should I rest for a while at the side
Your love is cradled in knowing
Eyes in the mirror, still expecting they'll come
Sensing too well when the journey is done
There is no turning back
No
There is no turning back

Get out, get up, get on, get moving out
Don't surrender - don't give up the fight

You give a little bit more
If you want her back - it's a full attack
You give a little bit more
And if you wanna win you don't give in you
Give a little bit more
When you think you're through what you gotta do is
Give a little bit more

Under your feet
Get out - get up - get on - get moving out
Don't surrender - don't give up the fight

You give a little bit more
If you want her back - it's a full attack
You give a little bit more
And if you wanna win you don't give in
Give a little bit more
When you think you're through what you gotta do you
Give a little bit more

Don't give up the fight - you gotta keep on
Going with all you might
Try hard don't stop - gotta keep on giving it
All you got
Never give up - never give up - never say die
Believe in, can reach the top
Gotta give it a shot don't say no gotta
Get in the flow

So don't hide go seek
Don't runaway - get back on your feet
Get out - get up - get on - get moving out
Don't surrender - don't give up the fight

You give a little bit more
If you want her back - it's a full attack
You give a little bit more
And if you wanna win you don't give in
Give a little bit more
When you think you're through what you gotta do
Give a little bit more",Cliff Richard,1983,"[98, 73, 75, 76, 81, 92, 95]",7
139,Allies,"[Intro: Wyclef Jean, Pras & Wise Intelligent]
Yo this mic is on?
The wickedest combination in the world!
No doubt, Poor Righteous Teachers, Refugees
You know what I'm saying?

[Verse 1: Pras]
Walk around in the record industry
I'm looking at all the Pharisees
Asking me where I'm going
All I know is one day that Babylon will be fallen
They welcome me into Jerusalem
Eighty niggas highly crucial by Ham
I got my .45 by my side
Just in case another nigga tests me someone's gonna die

[Verse 2: Wyclef Jean (Pras)]
Bo bo so bo I leave the boat for the pope
Smoke mad weed but not touch pelico
Primary purpose of the set
Is to present techniques and guided practice
And forced access to forfeit
Emcees lose focus
Wyclef to accomplish throwing crumbs in the hell pit
Vocabulary, comprehension, steady reading and critical analyzing
Techniques to enable DJs to interact with my material
Play it on your turntable scratch it if you're able
Characteristics, circumstances
Will determine how long you live Mr. actor, Mrs. actress
(I act will snatch gats from kids with backpacks who lack raps
In an Ac to get with that)

[Break: Wise Intelligent]
Easy! Ya man!
[?] something!

[Verse 3: Culture Freedom]
Black people say I represent when I get my chance
But when I'm ripping to this beat, yo it's my Nubian dance
That I be doing around these suckers' titles that I ruin
Although you do not like the flow you should not have been booing
Now you and your crew had better get your act together
Before I have to cut the Fu release the stormy weather
Whatever you say, but nigga pop your shit my way
And you'll be screaming ""Mercy me"" like if your name was Marvin Gaye
Now put it away and stay the fuck up out my face
I smack you in the mouth homeboy and you'll be missing taste
What a waste to everything existing up till now
So many claiming butter but just don't be knowing how

[Break: Wise Intelligent]
Gunshot!
So my selector, come with the rhythm!

[Verse 4: Pras]
For sure I'm law to be the poor righteous conscious
You might just feel thrust when I touch like Midas
My tongue is gigantic, lyrics are tremendous
Wyclef and Pras they drop hits wherever they goes like Gladys
Catch the midnight train to Georgia
As my tongue does a dropkick like Sgt. Slaughter
New world order, you lions who are trying to roar
I'll silence you lambs like Jodie Foster
There's no need to feel sentimental
Parental guidance is advised for those who despise
The Wise and Intelligent, Refugees, immigrants

[Break: Wise Intelligent]
My selector, Culture Freedom lay the wickedest basslines

[Verse 5: Wise Intelligent]
May...I... kick a little something for the G-O-D's in the J-E-R-S-E-Y
Because you niggas know me I'm the da gan ya dee
Sixteen five one three five coincide freak wise
Time you recognize who run up in the nine
Rush like water raw cuts in your guts
Trails from Rossell oh hell we rock bells
Live as Stuyvesant, Wise and them, rise again
The Gods A.V.G. they'll bomb Washin-
No man 'em trouble they jet something
Don't make me have to kick you on your God damned chin
I'll frappe you in your head with bottle of Heineken
Lord, Mister Wise, PRT - peace!

[Verse 6: Lauryn Hill]
OK, ha; my intellect will protect what you threaten
Captain to Lieutenant (bing), even take cadets in (bing)
I take them all rich and to the powerful
Don't fear no other force I be defining your hardcore
The folklore you spread down over tracks
Got you gassed off some shit may I suggest Ex-Lax
Relax! Your whole perception seems to be distorted
In my dimensions fake refugees get deported
Jokers be biting each other's styles so much it's eerie
So many deja vus but can't no other crews come near me
It's weary, my brothers couldn't hold this if they grasped it
Confession to Jesus are even tried to master
I passed it off the levels of your mere mathematics
I'm on some astrophysics Quantum Leaping on your tactics
Triple bypasses, your crew's slow as molasses
While I amass cream like Jackie Kennedy Onassis

[Break: Lauryn Hill]
Ah ah ah ah
Refugee P.R.T. connect
New Jersey, this is how we do it

[Outro: Wise Intelligent]
If hip hop was a thing that money could not buy
The righteous would never live and the righteous would never die

142,How Am I Supposed To Live Without You,"[Verse 1]
I can hardly believe it
When I heard the news today
I had to come and get it straight from you
They said you were leaving
Someone swept your heart away
From the look upon your face, I see it's true

So tell me all about it
Tell me all the plans you're making
Tell me one thing more before I go

[Chorus]
Tell me how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been living for is gone

[Verse 2]
I'm too proud for crying
I didn't come here to break down
It's just a dream of mine is coming to an end
And I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming
When even now it's more than I can take

[Chorus]
Tell me how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been living for is gone

Can I tell you what you mean to me?

Almost impossible to believe that you're mine
You're like weekends all year long
Under a hot Jamaican sun
You are a winner at a hundred to one
Yes, you are

Something you've got is something I need right now
You don't have to prove it no more

What am I gonna do? I'm so in love with you
What am I gonna say if ever you go away?

[Verse 2]
One in a million, oh, so rare

What am I gonna say if ever you go away?

[Verse 3]
I'll be a sleek one of a kind
And so difficult to define
I could drink a case of you any time
The Sistine Chapel and the Eiffel tower
A national anthem an April shower
Tomorrow's fashion and now I've found you
I'm complete

Something you've got is something I need right now
You don't have to prove it no more
I'm down on my bended knees, honey

What am I gonna do? I'm so in love with you
What am I gonna say if ever you go away?

Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy, but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (Yah I said it)
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food
Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you
Fuck you too, woo!

Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'
You mighta went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time
I ain't no gangster but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of nines
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My 12 days of Christmas was nothin' but lies (I)
Run at you hard like a sumo (Sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (Chulo)
I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno (Woo)
Bitch I'm a dog, call me Cujo (Rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw 4 like a Uno (Bup)
Cállate boca mejor, maricón, little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)
They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now
Shit get relevant 'til 'nother beef die down
In truth, a nigga just really want me tied down
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope (Yeah)

Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (Vroom!)

[Pre-Verse: Eminem]
I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em
Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference?
I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man, I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I've been eatin' long enough, man, my stomach should be full
I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me
Fuck you think? (Woo!)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I got a couple of mansions
Still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghost writers
But to these kids it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop?""
I said, ""I don't have any answers.""
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, ""What a wonderful feeling!""
""We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!""
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap
Let's recap, way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They know what button to press or what lever to pull
To get me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya digs in the fuckin' back, ho (Get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least 70 or 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I wrote 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain to pour
In that drought, y'all been prayin' for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboy

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas & Eminem]
So y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice",Eminem,1983,"[88, 90]",2

I can see your face on a piece of tomorrow
I'll hang my dream on a road I can follow
I gotta touch the warmth of your love

Not gonna chance a change of direction
Gonna keep on rolling till I find the connection

154,Take Another Picture,"Written by Marv Ross
Saw my father living in a picture
Squinting in the Michigan sun
Caught forever in his blouse and knickers
Wasn't he the lucky one?
While the fear is growing stronger
The sun is almost gone
So hold me in your naked eye
And shoot me on the ru&110

Oh, won't you please, please
Take another picture
Please, please freeze my features
Oh, won't you please, please
Take another
I don't wanna fade away
I saw a picture hidden in the bedroom
Underneath father's ties
A beautiful woman caught naked forever
Black strip over her eyes
I still remember that picture
The image sits sharp and clear
And I'll never erase that eyeless face
Still smiling all these years
Oh, won't you please, please
Take another picture
Please, please freeze my features
Oh, won't you please, please
Take another

With a bunch of Eves, no fruit punch for me
I sip from the Fountain of Youth
So if I die young, blame the juice
Bury me in New Orleans
Tombstone reads: ""Don’t cry, stay tuned.""
Bring me back to life
Got to lose a life just to have a life
But if heaven's as good as advertised
I want a triple extension on my motherfuckin’ afterlife
Rest in paradise

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Lil Wayne]
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry), don’t go (Why, oh why?)
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, whoa!
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie (Don't cry, don't cry)
I fuckin' love you, whoa! (Don't cry, don't cry)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Talent is God-given, be grateful
Fame is not a given, be humble
And conceit is self-driven, drive carefully
Stay in your own lane, seat buckled
And sometimes when there is no music
We toot our own horns, rum-bum-bum-bum
That woman carried the future
And Tunechi was born like, ""dun-dun-dun-dun-dun""
Don't call it a comeback
It was dark, now the sun back
Hit me hard, but I punched back
The wheels fell off, I rode the hubcap
Is it suicide or it's do or die?
It's newer days and it's bluer skies
I told myself, ""It's just you and I""
Then the breeze came and it blew my mind
Lord knows who I'm there for
I give my last breath of air for
Mama tell me to be careful
Voice in my head give me an earful
But I got mind control over my control
I lost control but knew I'd find control
I let God control what I cannot control
Can't control the tears, let 'em drop and roll

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Lil Wayne]
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie (Don't cry), I fuckin' love you, whoa!
(Triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife, rest in paradise)
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, whoa! (Don't cry)

Looking out, across the nighttime

Hear her voice, shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out, into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight

Then let me take a bite

168,Unconditional Love,"[Intro]
(What y'all want?)
Unconditional love (no doubt)
Talkin' about the stuff that don't wear off, it don't fade
It'll last for all these crazy days, these crazy nights
Whether you wrong or you right
A motherfucker still love you, still feel you
Still there for you, no matter what (hehe)
You will always be in my heart with unconditional love

[Verse 1]
Come listen to my truest thoughts, my truest feelings
All my peers doin' years beyond drug dealing
How many caskets can we witness
Before we see it's hard to live this life without God?
So we must ask forgiveness
Ask Mama why I got this urge to die
Witness the tears fallin' free from my eyes before she could reply
Though we were born without a silver spoon
My broken down TV show cartoons in my living room (hey)
One day I hope to make it, a player in this game
Mama, don't cry, long as we try maybe things change
Perhaps it's just a fantasy
A life where we don’t need no welfare and share with our whole family
Maybe it's me that caused it, the fightin' and the hurtin'
In my room cryin' because I didn't wanna be a burden
Watch Mama open up her arms to hug me
And I ain't worried 'bout a damn thing, with unconditional love

[Chorus]
In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love

[Verse 2]
Just got the message, you've been callin' all week
Been out here hustlin' on these streets
Ain't had a chance to speak
But you know, with you and me it's all G
We could never be enemies
'Cause you've been such a good friend to me
Where would I be without my dogs?
No wonder why when times get hard
'Cause it ain't easy bein' who we are
Driven by my ambitions, desire higher positions
So I proceed to make G's eternally
And my mission is to be more than just a rap musician
The elevation of today's generation, if I could make 'em listen
Prison ain't what we need, no longer stuck in greed
Time to plan, strategize, my family's gotta eat
We work somethin' out of nothin'
No pleasure in the sufferin'
Neighborhood would be good if they could cut out all the bustin'
The liquor and the weed, the cussin'
Sendin' love out to my block
The struggle never stops (unconditional love)

[Chorus]
In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love

[Verse 3]
I'll probably never understand your ways
With everyday I swear I hear you tryin' to change your ways
While gettin' paid at the same time
Just had a baby with the same eyes
Somethin' inside, please let me die, these are strange times
How come I never made it?
Maybe it's the way I played it in my heart
I knew one day I gotta be a star
My hopes and all my wishes, so many vivid pictures
And all the currency I'll never even get to see
This fast life soon shatters, 'cause after all the lights and screams nothin' but my dreams matter
Hopin' for better days, maybe a peaceful night
Baby, don't cry, 'cause everything gon' be alright
Just lay your head on my shoulder
Don't worry 'bout a thing, baby girl, I'm a soldier (huh)
Never treated me bad, no matter who I was
You still came with that unconditional love

[Chorus] (repeat to fade)
In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love",2Pac,1983,"[92, 43, 43, 47, 52, 61, 69, 82]",8
169,Don't Forget To Dance,"You look out of your window
Into the night
Could be rain, could be snow
But it can't feel as cold as you're feeling inside

And all of you friends are either married, vanished
Or just left alone
But that's no reason to just stop living
That's no excuse to just give in to a sad and lonely heart

Don't forget to dance, no, no, no
Don't forget to smile
Don't forget to dance, no, no, no
Forget it for a while

'Cause darling, darling
I bet you danced a good one in your time
And if this were a party
I'd really make sure the next one would be mine
Yes, you with the broken heart

Don't forget to dance, no, no, no
Don't forget to smile
Don't forget to dance, no, no, no
Forget it for a while

Don't forget to dance, no, no, no
Forget it for a while

You walk down the street
And all the young punks whistle at you
A nice bit of old
Just goes to show what you can achieve
With the right attitude
As you pass them by
They whisper their remarks one to another
And you give them the eye
Even though you know that you could be their mother
You do the thing you love the most
What separates you from the rest
And what you love to do the most?
And when they ask me how you dance
I say that you dance real close

Don't forget to dance, no, no, no

170,Kiss The Bride,"[Verse 1]

With my own exquisite ways to waste my life
Walking my cross around with no complains
Althrough the love, but times have changed

Nowhere I went that i would want to stay
Nothing I had I didn't throw away
No flashing spotlight hanging over me
Made heaven look oh heavenly

If I'm allowed to kiss the bride
Then nothing else would ever really count, and I
Give everything to cast aside
Oh memory, so gracefully I kiss the bride

I hear the engines and the traffic roar
Same street but different than it was before
Sideways the alleys and the avenues
Eventually all lead to you

Then nothing else would ever really count, and I
Give everything to cast aside
Oh memory, so gracefully I kiss the bride

For us to feel this way
Can a good thing last
Longer than a day?

Now that we caught fire?
Will something greater grow
Out of this desire?
Should I drop my guard
At the risk of being used?
But the way you do those things to me
How can I refuse?

I could get addicted
To your energy
The way you take me over
Pulling on me
Our hearts beat together
Our timing is the same
Can I trust my feelings
Save myself the pain?

Where do we take it now
Now that we caught fire?
Will something greater grow
Out of this desire?
Should I drop my guard
At the risk of being used?
But the way you do those things to me
How can I refuse?

We could share they mystery
Spare ourselves the misery
Discover it again every day
We could take love all the way

Cold blooded, cold blooded

[Verse 1]
The way you've been treating me is getting out of hand
And you walk around like you're so innocent
I gave you my heart and it melted in your arms
This isn't a place that I belong

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel your fear
Surrounded by your skin
You feel my heartbeat vibrate so violent
Inside of your head
I see it in your eyes
You're no good for me
And love is blind

[Chorus]
Ooh, and cold blooded, cold blooded
You want what I'm giving up
But my love is not enough
Cold blooded, cold blooded
And I can’t feel my fingertips
But you feel better when we touch

[Verse 2]
I lost my sight and you're leading me on
Is it 'cause you're used to guys always doing you wrong?
Do you really love me?
Or is it just revenge?
Lately you don't seem so genuine

[Pre-Chorus]
And I feel your fear
Surrounded by your skin
You feel my heartbeat vibrate so violent
Inside of your head
I see it in your eyes (see it in your eyes)
That you're no good for me
And love is blind

[Chorus]
Ooh, and cold blooded, cold blooded
You want what I'm giving up
But my love is not enough
Cold blooded, cold blooded
And I can't feel my fingertips
But you feel better when we touch

[Bridge]
Mmmm
Fill me up, keep me hot
Use me up of all I've got

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel your fear
Surrounded by your skin
You feel my heartbeat vibrate so violent
Inside of your head
I see it in your eyes
You're no good for me
And love is blind

You want what I'm giving up

I think my heart must just be slowing down
Among the human beings
In their designer jeans
Am I the only one who hears the screams
And the strangled cries of lawyers in love

God sends his spaceships to America the beautiful
They land at six o'clock and there we are, the dutiful
Eating from TV trays
Tuned into Happy Days
Waiting for World War III while Jesus slaves
To the mating calls of lawyers in love

Last night I watched the news from Washington, the capital
The Russians escaped while we weren't watching them, like Russians will
Now we've got all this room
We've even got the moon
And I hear the USSR will be open soon

183,Fight Fire With Fire,"Wild is the night that keeps me from you
I'm tearing my hair up with things that you do
Strong is my love and strong with desire
For working my way back to you
If our love is true
If our love is one
As soft as the pillow that keeps you from harm
You got me by the crook of my arm
First in a round left to you
We had a fight
Did we chose
You can't but no band blow refuse
But if you win that means I lose
And I am clound like you too

Fight fire with fire
More fire, more fire
Fight fire with fire
More fire, more fire

Where are you now ?
Can't find my way home
Streets are too cold when you walk them alone
Without your love I sink like a stone
For love is what's pulling us through
I know I never do what I'm told
Minds in the gutter
My heart's holy gold
When they made you they bust at the mold
Flames holding back think they knew you

Fight fire with fire
More fire, more fire
Fight fire with fire
More fire, more fire

When I see grey, I know you see black
I dig the Stones you dig Sheer Heart Attack
Say dirty things you say back and black
Or maybe hysteria too

Hush about love
You're breaking my heart
There is no answer with goals after part
Why does they clean
Go back to the star
Is that what you think we must do you?

Fight fire with fire
More fire, more fire
Fight fire with fire

Decisions to be made

The best of plans mislaid

In an old familiar way
The forming of a new connection
To study or to play

And so the conversation turned
Until the sun went down
And many fantasies were learned
On that day

Keep feeling fascination
Passion burning
Love so strong
Keep feeling fascination

But she was gone with the night
I thought about the things she said
And all the things we'd done
But where could she run?
There's just no answer to give

[Verse 3]
I keep on wonderin' 'bout her, day and night
She probably thinks I was a fool, she's right
She don't know it, but I'm gonna keep on searchin' for that woman
I'm gonna search everywhere

I still listen for her endlessly
But it never even crossed my mind, she was a cheater

That traveled through light
Translate this mystery
That covered my eyes
Accept approaching fear
And courage appears
Death is a certainty
It's growing near

Letting go is fateful

Uniting broken rhymes
That visions divide
Painting my memories
That colored my life

Somewhere safe and sheltered
Saved forever

Stuck in the light of day
Waiting for answers
A seed that grew into branches
Another page has turned, ended a letter
Come on home and return to the canvas of life

Shapes and boundaries
Will not disappear
Detangle the misery
And enter new spheres

Facing right and wrong
While waiting for life
Can't change this destiny
The curtain's close by

While your leaves descended
Earth starts to unfold

Stuck in the light of day
Waiting for answers
A seed that grew into branches
Another page has turned, ended a letter
Come on home and return to the canvas of life

You're falling down
While my fortune's alive
We're safe and sound on the ground
Time to found new memories

The stains come alive where the paint has gone dry
You float above looking down reaching out to me
Depicting a beautiful scene that shapes divinity

Stuck in the light of day
Waiting for answers
A seed that grew into branches
Another page has turned, ended a letter

I'll come on home
I'm in the light of day
Questions were answered
A new life's arms are extending
The final page has turned, sending the letter
Come on home

Both falling for love, but not quite all the way
Look at us now, reaching back to yesterday
Longing to know if they are the ones to stay

After all I'm the one who said we're through
Now I can't live without anymore
Out there lost is the dream that can't come true
Is it worth the reaching for?
Don't you want me anymore, darling?

Hold me till the morning comes
Until I see your smile
Take all the sadness from your eyes
Hold me till the morning sun
Let me stay we've just begun

Where shall we start? Tender words that we can share
Different beliefs, in time we will get there
Look at us now, wanting more than words can say
Both falling for love but distant all the way

Out there lost are the words, I still love you
But they're worth the reaching for
Do you love me anymore, darling?

Hold me till the morning comes
Until I see your smile
Take all the sadness from your eyes
Hold me till the morning sun
Let me stay we've just begun

Hold me till the morning comes
Until I see your smile
Take all the sadness from your eyes

Hold me till the morning sun
Let me stay we've just begun
I wanna stay with you

Hold me till the morning comes
Until I see your smile
Take all the sadness from your eyes
Hold me till the morning sun

Would you leave without a warning?

So alone, the home we had has turned out its lights

And all around, your sound, your thoughts are ever so near
It's hard to take, this wait; I'm always wanting you here

Well I gave you everything from the depths of my heart
From the day you took my ring we drifted apart
I have one thing more to say

Though it may be hard to see
If you change your mind, will you know just where I'll be
If you ever need me

Feeling bluesy, you know you do confuse me all night
I sit at home, alone and wonder if you're all right
And all around, your sound, your thoughts are ever so near
It's hard to take, this wait; I'm always waiting to here

Well I gave you everything from the depths of my heart
From the day you took my ring we drifted apart

Above all home baby
We better settle all

Are we lying to ourselves?
Denying what we suspected all along

210,What's She Got,"[Verse 1]
So great that you’re in love
But why d’you call me up at 2AM, to say it’s kinda tough
But she can’t stand all your friends?
Funny how when we hang out, stare all night at your phone
Oh stop, guess what
The guilt trip works and you gotta run home
What’s she got? You said you wouldn’t change
What’s she got? You know for her it’s just a game

[Chorus]
What’s she got you can’t resist
She treats you so bad but you just can’t quit
You come runnin when her fingers snap
A guy like you deserves better than that
What’s she got? You look so down
You never frown like that when I’m around
It’s true, all she’s got that I don’t have is you

[Verse 2]
How come you give so much
When she’s all take take take?
And when she’s mad at you
My heart begins to break
What’s She Got?
She’s just killing time
What’s She Got?
Maybe one day you’ll be mine

[Chorus]
What’s she got you can’t resist
She treats you so bad but you just can’t quit
You come runnin when her fingers snap
A guy like you deserves better than that
What’s she got? You look so down
You never frown like that when I’m around
It’s true
All she’s got that I don’t have is

[Bridge]
A perfect life, a perfect smile
And perfect legs that go on for miles
A perfect house, a perfect car
And a second home, in the south of France
And all those clothes with designer names
And shoes and bags it’s such a shame
But maybe I can understand it’s true
Why you think you love her like you do…

[Chorus]
So that’s what’s she got you can’t resist
She treats you so bad but you just can’t quit
You come runnin when her fingers snap
A guy like you deserves better than that
What’s she got? You look so down
You never frown like that when I’m around
It’s true

All she’s got that I don’t have is you
What’s she got you can’t resist
She treats you so bad but you just can’t quit
You come runnin when her fingers snap
A guy like you deserves better than that
What’s she got? You look so down
You never frown like that when I’m around
It’s true

And tell me that I'm forgiven

But now I intend to open up
And love you even more

It seems so clear
I had it all when you were here
Oh, you gave it all
And I took it for granted

But if there's some feeling left in you
Some flicker of love
That still shines through
Let's talk it out
Let's talk about second chances

Wait and see
It's gonna be sweeter than it was before
I gave some then
But now I intend to dedicate myself to giving more

Solo i fogli che ho io in casa
Sanno quello che c'ho in testa
La mia psiche fucking drama
E pensa che manco l'ho scelta
Io sono lo stesso di prima
Ho solo i tattoo da galera
E so che se penso al futuro mi tocco le palle
Sì, come in barriera
Ho imparato 'sta roba per strada senza codici vari
Ma il mio lato migliore è da un po' che sta a casa
Come ai domiciliari
Odio le gare, rischio di farsi legare
L'ora legale, due presupposti
Che ne sai che mi invento una svolta
E riscrivo la storia in quell'ora che sposti
Vedo i cloni di cloni di cloni, pecora Dolly
Fottiti la vita a pecora e dormi
Non realizzarsi fa schifo
È per questo sto a un metro dai sogni
È duro il destino finché non sei un cocco di mamma
Non ho mai cash, frate' corto di braccia
È come un thriller col doppio di suspence
Datemi il colpo di grazia
E ne ho visti un sacco che c'hanno tentato
Flow è un attentato
Parli di strada, ma in strada tu non ci sai stare
Sembra che sei neopatentato

Cause if it ain't dope
Their ain't no hope
They ain't gone buy it

Quarter bag mostly shake but this'll have to do I guess

I saw the mack when I was only 11 years old
And I swore to never be a simp for a ho
Approach the closed do'
It crack open before my eyes
Shorty with a doobie of her own I am not surprised
Cause I don't kick it on the low
With no bitches that don't get high
Wrap me a to go plate and ask if I want her to drive

224,Saved By Zero,"Maybe someday
Saved by zero
I'll be more together
Stretched by fewer
Thoughts that leave me
Chasing after
My dreams disown me
Loaded with danger

So, maybe I'll win (saved by zero)
Maybe I'll win (saved by zero)

Holding on to
Words that teach me
I will conquer
Space around me

So, maybe I'll win (saved by zero)
Maybe I'll win (saved by zero)

225,Solsbury Hill,"[Verse 1]
Climbing up on Solsbury Hill
I could see the city light
Wind was blowing, time stood still
Eagle flew out of the night
He was something to observe
Came in close, I heard a voice
Standing stretching every nerve
Had to listen, had no choice

[Chorus 1]
I did not believe the information
I just had to trust imagination
My heart going boom boom boom
""Son,"" he said
""Grab your things, I've come to take you home""

[Verse 2]
To keep in silence I resigned
My friends would think I was a nut
Turning water into wine
Open doors would soon be shut
So I went from day to day
Though my life was in a rut
'Til I thought of what I'd say
Which connection I should cut

[Chorus 2]
I was feeling part of the scenery
I walked right out of the machinery
My heart going boom boom boom
""Hey,"" he said
""Grab your things, I've come to take you home""
Ay, back home

[Verse 3]
When illusion spin her net
I'm never where I want to be
And liberty she pirouette
When I think that I am free
Watched by empty silhouettes
Who close their eyes but still can see
No one taught them etiquette
I will show another me

[Chorus 3]
Today I don't need a replacement
I'll tell them what the smile on my face meant
My heart going boom boom boom
""Hey"" I said
""You can keep my things, they've come to take me home""",Peter Gabriel,1983,"[84, 86, 92]",3
226,Change,"[Intro: J. Cole]
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days, yeah
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I like this tone

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, my intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I sit in silence and find whenever I meditate
My fears alleviate, my tears evaporate
My faith don't deviate, ideas don't have a date
But see I'm growing and getting stronger with every breath
Bringing me closer to Heaven's doors with every step
As we speak I'm at peace, no longer scared to die
Most niggas don't believe in God and so they terrified
It's either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell
Asking the Father for forgiveness, got 'em overwhelmed (Please, God, I want to go to Heaven)
As if He's spiteful like them white folks that control the jail
See I believe if God is real, He'd never judge a man
Because He knows us all and therefore He would understand
The ignorance that make a nigga take his brother life
The bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife

[Chorus: J. Cole]
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Yeah, my chosen religion
Jesus piece frozen from sinnin'
Doin' dirt, hoping to God, He know my intentions
To see a million 'fore I see a casket
I got a baby on the way, know he gon' be a bastard
I'm living fast like I'm in a drag race, how that cash taste
When I was a senior, I was ballin' on my classmates
Niggas put three bullets in my car, one hit the gas tank
Know I got a angel cause I'm supposed to have a halo
Right now, my lifestyle destined for a federal facility
For my ability to make them birds fly
Fiends wanna get higher than a bird's eye view
And who am I to tell a nigga what to do?
I just supply, it's economics
My business ain't got the suit and tie
Keep a pistol at all times, niggas want what's mine
I can't oblige, dog, I work too hard
So reach for it, get referred to God, I'm going hard, nigga

[Chorus: J. Cole]
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from—

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Yeah, prodigal son, got a new gun
This one don't run out of ammo
Lately been working on my handles
Can I ball, become a star and remain my self?
If I fall, dust it off and regain my self
Fuck 'em all, they don't know all the pain I felt
I'm in awe, after all the fame I felt, I evolved
I no longer bury demons, I be a vessel for the truth until I'm barely breathing, I'm singing

[Bridge: Ari Lennox & J. Cole]
Life is all about the evolution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
You can dream but don't neglect the execution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Time is short that's what somebody told me
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Too short to keep following your homies
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more

[Bridge: J. Cole]
I reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands
All of a sudden niggas pop a trunk and then we scram
Finger on trigger make a little nigga understand
What it's like to finally be the motherfuckin' man
Eyes wide that's from the power that the coward feels
Niggas die over bitches, disrespect, and dollar bills
Bloodshed that turned the city to a battlefield
I call it poison, you call it real (pop, pop, pop, pop)
That's how you feel?

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
Pistols be poppin' and niggas drop in a heartbeat
Scattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete
A body laid on the concrete
Look, somebody laid on the concrete
No time for that, ain't no lookin' back, cause I'm running too
I made it home, I woke up and turned on the morning news
Overcame with a feeling I can't explain
Cause that was my nigga James that was slain, he was 22
(Last night at around...) He was 22
(22 year old black male, suspect, reporting live...)

[Outro: J. Cole]
(I swear to God, bruh)
We're gathered here today...
(I swear to God)
To mourn the life of James McMillan Jr
(I swear to God—nigga, I'ma kill them niggas, man)
A tragedy, another tragedy in the black community
(I promise you, bro...)
We got to do better, people
22 years old, this boy was too young
(I promise you, bro, I'ma kill them niggas, yo...)
Our condolences go to his family, our prayers
(I'ma kill them niggas myself...)
We know he's in a better place
We know he's in a better place
But this has got to end, ladies and gentleman
We've got to come together, this is—this is beyond words
Now I'd like to open this ceremony with a verse from—",J. Cole,1983,"[92, 78, 73, 76, 83, 90]",6

I went to a garden party to reminisce with my old friends
A chance to share old memories and play our songs again
When I got to the garden party, they   knew my name
But no one recognized me, I didn't look the same

[Chorus]
But it’s alright now, I learned my lesson well
You see, you can’t please everyone, so you gotta please yourself

[Verse 2]
People came from miles around and everyone was there
Yoko brought her walrus, there was magic in the air
And over in the corner, much to my surprise
Mr. Hughes hid in Dylan’s shoes, wearing his disguise

[Chorus]
But it’s alright now, I learned my lesson well
You see, you can’t please everyone, so you gotta please yourself

[Verse 3]
I played them all the old songs, I thought that’s why they came
But no one heard the music, we didn’t look the same
I said ""Hello"" to Mary Lou, she belongs to me
And when I sang a song about a Honky Tonk, it was time to leave

[Chorus]
But it’s alright now, I learned my lesson well
You see, you can’t please everyone, so you gotta please yourself

[Verse 4]
Someone opened up a closet door and out stepped Johnny B. Good
Playin' guitar like ringin' a bell, and looking like he should
If you gotta play at garden parties, I wish you a lot of luck
But if memories were all I sang, I’d rather drive a truck

But it’s alright now, I learned my lesson well
You see, you can’t please everyone, so you gotta please yourself

Don't know if that goal is feasible, or it isn't
But if it is then God, if you're listenin'
Please grant me the strength to crush all competition
You can't blame me for dreaming, I'm a dreamer
And if I'm coming off brash, please forgive me
But, that's all I want

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9""]
I just wanna be the illest MC (That's all I want)
The same time being as real as can be
Mayhem, sickness, murder, horror
These are the kind of words that describe my aura
G Rap, Ras Kass, Kurupt
Redman I am cut from that cloth
Write a rhyme about me, you a dead man
Cool J, I'm Bad video
Learned the whole routine and performed it for my father's friends
While they smoked and drank
Symphony, D.O.C. inspired me to write what
Would eventually put me on airplanes like B.o.B
Canibus, Wu-Tang, you know our history, but hats off
When we rap this Jack Frost we outline the track chalk
Thank God for the one-two cadence
Thank God for the lunchroom tables
I'm tryna be the sickest nigga, dead or alive
And if I happen to fall short, it's been one hell of a ride
Chronic 1 and 2, looking up at the sky at the sun
Up until the day the sun is you

Wayne' house, Nas' house

So welcome, to our house
Where no one, comes back out
You won't find, comfort
In here, in here, in here

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
When I was a little boy I wanted to be a rapper
Wanted to be on the radio and snapping pictures after
And so I grabbed my pen and pad and scribbled chitter chatter
It started off wack
But in the words of a ten year old, my shit was getting phatter
I hit the studio at 16, stupid ill
Not knowing how the booth would feel, what's ADAT's and two inch reel
How you ad-lib? What's a punch? I ain't a boxer
But I sure enough learned the ropes, look D and Mike you made a monster
Now everyday's a game of Contra, I got 99 men
An infinite amount of rounds inside this mighty fine pen
This is my dream, don't fuck with it, I'm telling you
'Cause anyone can get dusted as long as production is available
I'm disgusted as a fan, look how niggas sounding, damn
Weak head, ya'll suck bad, fuck swag and your kicks from South Japan
I'm finna to be the best in this profession
I've been invested all my life, so wipe your feet before you step in

But, that's all I want

I just wanna be the illest MC (That's all I want)
The same time being as real as can be

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
Yo, in my house, the lights out
No utilities in the facilities
Feeling my life's 'bout, to wipe out
These feelings I'm feeling be killing me
I pull the mic out, can't strike out
'Cause if winning is really my enemy
I pull a nine out, blow my mind out
Is the end of me really serenity?
Man in my house, it's rap or die
Get a piece of that apple pie
Life is a Pharcyde song, and that bitch just passed us by
So I, got lyrically complex, that way I could clock checks
Get my moms out the projects, with these concepts, competition can't digest
And then I stress 'cause the road is rough
I start feeling like shit's sour
The electricity in my will power could still power the twin towers
For ten hours, so send cowards
The message from Crooked I
Royce Da 5, Joe Budden, Em, Yaowa

[Verse 4: Eminem]
In our, house we spit like Sig Sauers
The way I feel now I could spit for six hours
Straight, only way to be great, is to dig down, if you can hear this sound in-
-side my head sounds like a fucking drive-by
That's what the inside of my mind's like
Looking back on my career, even hindsights, tunnel vision, 5 mics
Never wanted that so bad, felt like-I-could-go-mad
Nomad with a notepad
Go Taz, spaz on these ho bags
That bothered me, but I never wanna show that
Just don't act like it ever does
Even though you know that there will never come
A day someone blows past you, never was
Someone who's as dope as you ever was
And you hope that's, true 'cause the competitor in you
Couldn't let somebody be better than you
And you know that, so you don't ever hold back
What you gonna go back into working a regular job?
Fuck that, I'mma go hard, grab on my, gonads
Tell them fuck theyselves
They call me a wigger like Renee Zell'
But I raised hell like a stay-at-home dad
Rap is the only thing that I was ever really, bad to the bone at
Guess I'm similar to, gangrene when I'm, angry then I'm
Hulk Smash, so much passion but no compassion
If eyes are the windows to the soul
Then it's, broken glass and there's no trespassing
Alright now here we go
Dre stamped me now I'm stamping Yelawolf
Get ready for the most competitive
Clique in the world it's like Clash of the Titans
I released the cracker it's time to set it again
And when it's said and it's all done
None shall ever fuck with this squadron
So come on in, at your own risk
This is (Our House) Bitch!

You stab me in the back, not once but twice

Telling straight lies, dry snitching on me
Claiming it wasn’t you, behind the line up glass
You straight pointed out me, to save your own ass
I’d rather sweat buckets, to search out peace
Than spilling gallons of blood, fighting demons in me
The battle continues, frighten the anger within
It’s a full time job, dealing with FAKE ASS FRIENDS
Ever time I think I know, what you’ll do next
You end up selling me out, for a yard or less
You made you a dollar, so I’m screaming again
You’re a straight up punk, a FAKE ASS FRIEND
I can sit and formulate a plan in my head
Take a sniper shot; make your FAKE ASS DEAD
Now I’m on the run, a fugitive at large
Ain't a FAKE ASS FRIEND around, worth taking a
Charge
Their a dime a dozen, you can find them anywhere
Just don’t be fooled, because its buyer beware
It’s a known street rule, don’t say it wasn’t said
Because FAKE ASS FRIENDS, usually wined up dead
But ill take what GOD gave me common sense, and
Walk away
It’s a soft ass move, but Ill write another day
Not locked up covered up, dealing with my sins
Nothing wrong with cutting off, a FAKE ASS FRIEND
Ain't a chick or dude around, can’t relate to what I’m
Saying
We all had friends, which were straight perpetrating
Saying they got our back, all the way to the end
Same ole same ole, just a FAKE ASS FRIEND

236,How Do You Keep The Music Playing,"[James Ingram + Patti Austin + both]
How do you keep the music playing?
How do you make it last?
How do you keep the song from fading
Too fast?

How do you lose yourself to someone
And never lose your way?
How do you not run out of new things
To say?

And since you know we're always changing
How can it be the same?

And tell me how year after year
You're sure your heart won't fall apart
Each time you hear his name?

I know the way I feel for you is now or never
The more I love
The more that I'm afraid
That in your eyes I may not see forever
Forever

If we can be the best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends
If we can try with every day to make it better
As it grows
With any luck then I suppose
The music never ends

I know
How do you keep the music playing?
The way I feel for you is now or never
How do you make it last?
The more I love
The more that I'm afraid
How do you keep the song from fading?
That in your eyes I may not see forever
Keep the song from fading
Forever

If we can be the best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends
If we can try with every day to make it better
As it goes
With any luck then I suppose
The music never ends
How do you keep it playing, baby? Oh (Oh)
I wanna know, how do you do it?
How do you keep the music playing over and over?",James Ingram,1983,"[93, 91, 75, 68, 71, 63, 54, 49, 45, 46, 47, 47, 50, 53, 58, 70, 80]",17

239,Crazy,"[Verse 1]
I remember when
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions had an echo, in so much space
And when you're out there without care
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much

[Chorus 1]
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly

[Verse 2]
And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice, that's my only advice
Come on now, who do you
Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?
Ha, ha, ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control?

[Chorus 2]
Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me

[Verse 3]
My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on the limb
And all I remember is thinkin' I wanna be like them
Ever since I was little
Ever since I was little, it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done

I did not know there was a plan
Somewhere a perfect man

As you broke down my defenses
Just want to be where you are
Love ain't like fashion
The look remains the same
I'll wear your heart forever
'Cause some things never change

After lightning the thunder cracks

Sooner or later it had to come true
Like rain, tax
Weeds grow up through the pavement cracks

You see what I want
What I want is you

[Verse 2]
Thought that life was logical
Love was a miracle
That happened to someone else, not me
Baby, I must've said a little prayer
Suddenly I looked up and you were there
And the rest is history
I don't want to be an island anymore
Just resign yourself
'Cause there's one thing for sure

[Chorus]
Like rain, tax
After lightning the thunder cracks

Sooner or later it had to come true
Like rain, tax
Weeds grow up through the pavement cracks

It had to be you
It had to be you
Say you'll be here forever
You and me here together
When will you see what I want
What I want is you

243,Come Dancing,"They put a parking lot on a piece of land
Where the supermarket used to stand
Before that they put up a bowling alley
On the site that used to be the local Palais
That's where the big bands used to come and play
My sister went there on a Saturday

Come dancing
All her boyfriends used to come and call
Why not come dancing?
It's only natural

Another Saturday, another date
She would be ready but she's always make them wait
In the hallway in anticipation
He didn't know the night would end up in frustration
He'd end up blowing all his wages for the week
All for a cuddle and a peck on the cheek

Come dancing
That's how they did it when I was just a kid
And when they said come dancing
My sister always did

My sister should have come in at midnight
And my mum would always sit up and wait
It always ended up in a big row
When my sister used to get home late

Out of my window I can see them in the moonlight
Two silhouettes saying goodnight by the garden gate

The day they knocked down the Palais
My sister stood and cried
The day they knocked down the Palais
Part of my childhood died, just died

Now I'm grown up and playing in a band
And there's a car park where the Palais used to stand
My sister's married and she lives on an estate
Her daughters go out now it's her turn to wait
She knows they get away with things she never could
But if I asked her I wonder if she would

Come dancing
Come on sister have yourself a ball
Don't be afraid to come dancing
It's only natural

Come dancing
Just like the Palais on a Saturday
And all her friends will come dancing

246,West Coast Summer Nights,"[Intro]
Every fucking thing that crawls, is going to pay
The following is a DJ Skee presentation
Datpiff.com world premiere
Yo killa B, drop it right here, c'mon

[Verse 1: Game]
Operation kill everything, kill everything
Married to myself, fuck a wedding ring
Tried that shit twice, gave that girl everything
She a good woman, she got good goals
Love her to death but can't be in that fishbowl
Niggas gotta live and what the fuck does it matter if I take care of my kids
I got three of them little niggas
And every time they smile I see me in them little niggas
I get my heart I get my soul and nobody fucking with me till Harlem 20 years old
And that day I'm gon' retire, look back at my career
Like I started from the bottom, Now I'm mofuckin' here
Look back at my career like I started-
Started to do something, shit I've been working out for two summers
In the gym Ipod on Cruel Summer
When everybody dope in your clique you do numbers
But I ain't got no clique
Still got the same cars, and broads sucking my dick
Still fuck the same stars that (uh) up in my six
Still finding old panties and bras up in my whip
This bitch got my dick hard as Roc Nation
That's like Cole and Hov at a show keeping fans waiting
And you know they ain't go do that
Girl go and do that
Guess it's time to turn up
I got a whole lot of marijuana to burn up
And I ain't mean to make you stop
But it ain't a party without Aquahydrate and Ciroc so
""You are now logged on to Datpiff.com

[Recording: Diddy]
Hey yo, what up Game
What's up, it's your boy Diddy man
I'm just gettin' back from Vegas
Yeah man, party was off the chain
Well, I'm back in sunny California
And it never rains in southern California
Yeah yeah yeah all that man
So I decided to throw this white party man
So I'm up at the mansion right now
I just emptied out the pool, filled it up with Aquahydrate
So you know when the chicks is in the pool, they correctly balanced
And also, we got the Ciroc fountains overflowin'
Blue dot, red dot, white dot
Man I want you to come and bring the whole crew
Bring that west coast love, the all white party man
And we goin' to leave colors at home, I know you wanna wear all red man
But you gotta wear all white to this one man
And tell Snoop that too, he gotta wear all white to this one man
I see ya'll at the white party at the mansion man
Hey yo, let's get it
Love
Hey yo, Chuck for real, wear all white

Lucky this Ash, I got this fire ass kush from my cousin
I'mma come over and smoke it later, aight? Aight

Hey Lucky, this Andrea
Just comin' from this bitch Ashley house
I'm bout to suck the skin off yo dick, and she ain't e'en know it

Fuck she just say?!

Hey Lucky, this Andrea
Just comin' from this bitch Ashley house
I'm bout to suck the skin off yo dick, and she ain't e'en know it

[Verse 2: Game]
I guess we going to Diddy's
It ain't a party without the king of the fucking city
Handsome ass nigga these bitches is fucking with me
Woke up in that new Bugatti these pigs ain't fuckin' with me
I'm like Dr. J with his fro
Something like Boston George with the blow
Pumping white how I got it just so you know
Slummer light how I'm zipping up all this dough
Summer nights we at Toxic with all these hoes
Then we back at the mansion take off them clothes
I let my niggas hit it first I'm in and out
Just as quick as niggas spit a verse then they out
Then I'm back to the booth
Rollin' up sipping some 80 proof
And I dont chase the liquor or these hoes
Heard Jordan got some new shit out, Boog order those
Just bought me a Ghost like where the Rolls
Perrier Jouët, supperclub with all my bros
Can't get none of my bitches to wear they clothes
Plus I sit back and still get paid like Derrick Rose

[Outro: Game]
Stat, we done started somethin'
Stat, we done started somethin'
Stat, we done started somethin'
Ready To Die, Illmatic or Tha Carter somethin'
Wanna see that Louie duffle? Go buy a car or something
We done started somethin'

247,Who's Behind The Door?,"We sailed away
We walked two thousand miles and then we slipped away
We looked so hard
But couldn't seem to find just what the world was for
Now we know
Just what the journey's for
Looking out to the stars
Think about what you are
What do they think of you
Animals in their zoo
They haven't got the time
Landing is not on their minds
How do they have the nerve
We're animals in preserve

They watch us all
They're only making sure that we don't trip and fall
They looked so hard
But they can't tell us why they're here and just what for
Because they don't know
Who opened up the door

How can we find out more
Who owns the keyless door
Where does the circle end
Who are the unwatched men
Where do we go from here
Faith is a fading fear
Life is a waiting room
I hope they don't call me soon

How much more do you really think you know than a flower does about who's behind the door!",Zebra,1983,"[95, 66, 61, 62, 71, 76, 81, 87]",8

[Verse 2: Drake]
They say he wanted the bounce back
I can easily make them admit that the bounce back
Without knowing exactly where my accounts at
Yeah, you best believe
That I often tend to surpass what the rest achieve
So, they don't like me
They throw parties, and yet they never invite me
I can't lie, sometime it bother me slightly
Either way the true fans yell
I appear calm, and it's obvious of who can't tell
And no, this ain't Blu Cantrell
This is like perfection, though we both got the light complexion
Couple things I do damn well
And the way that I Jack son, you figure Drake knew Sam. L
I'm for real though
I'm from Memphis, I'm often labeled as Trill so
They stay kicking it with me like a field goal
See I'm humble, but I live fame
For more deals on the table than abridge game. Ahh

251,Scarlet Fever,"Chorus
I'm afraid of Scarlet because
I'm fallin' in love
And I am not ready to die
Scarlet fever is killing me

She's a sophisticated lady
It's that easy to explain
Her name is Scarlet
But I'm not sure about who we are yet

And I find it very hard to fight
I mean this woman seems to do every single thing so right
International woman, she has seen a time or two
Knock knock, who is it? Oh Scarlet how nice of you to visit

She's an interesting character in a movie about me
Me and Scarlet and Scarlet fever, which one should I call it

And things that I have not said she hears
Then she just does something to me and then disappears

Chorus x2
I'm afraid of Scarlet because
I'm fallin' in love
And I am not ready to die
Scarlet fever is killing me

Such a special love
Feels like fire every time I touch her
It's Scarlet fever, and I'm not ashamed to say that I need her
It's the sweetest sickness that I have ever known
I think I love her, I just hope that I don't cry because of her

And I noticed that every time she came
It's amazing how she never ever looks the same
And I know you know, I know you do
Because you are just too good to be true

Chorus x2
I'm afraid of Scarlet because
I'm fallin' in love
And I am not ready to die
Scarlet fever is killing me

Refrain x2
I said I don't wanna stay
I don't wanna go
All I really know is that I just don't know
It's fever, oh lord, it's Scarlet fever",CeeLo Green,1983,"[99, 94]",2
252,The Salt In My Tears,"[Verse 1]
I've tried and I've tried for so long to please you
Gave you every bit of my time
Gave you everything I could possibly give you
My body, my heart, and my mind
I turned my family and good friends against me
Listened to my own heart break
And I did it all in the name of love
Gave up myself for your sake

[Chorus]
And you never cared about me
You only hurt and deceive
I realize after all of these years
That you are not worth the salt in my tears

[Verse 2]
You've cheated, you've lied and you've hurt me
Over and over again
You promised to love me forever
But forever reached a bitter sweet end
Been blinded by love to your actions
But at last I can see my way clear
I've cried and I've tried, and I've tried and I've cried
But you, you've never shed one tear

[Chorus]
And you never cared about me
You only hurt and deceive
I realize after all of these years
That you are not worth the salt in my tears

[Verse 3]
You are not worth, you are not worth the salt in my tears
Treated like dirt, I'm hurt, I am not hanging around here
You've left me crying, left me crying for years
But you are not worth the salt in my tears

[Chorus]
And you never cared about me
You only hurt and deceive
I realize after all of these years
That you are not worth the salt in my tears",Dolly Parton,1983,"[100, 91, 66, 52, 36, 37, 39, 43, 49, 52, 54, 62, 66, 74, 86]",15
253,I'm Still Standing,"[Verse 1]
You could never know what it's like
Your blood, like winter, freezes just like ice
And there's a cold, lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use

[Verse 2]
And did you think this fool could never win?
Well look at me, I'm a-coming back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standing
You just fade away

[Chorus]
Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did?
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3]
Once, I never coulda hoped to win
You starting down the road, leaving me again
The threats you made were meant to cut me down
And if our love was just a circus, you'd be a clown by now

[Chorus]
You know I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Before you break my heart

Baby, baby, I'm aware of where you go
Each time you leave my door
I watch you walk down the street
Knowing your other love, you'll meet

But this time before you run to her
Leaving me alone and hurt
(Think it over)
After I've been good to you
(Think it over)
After I've been sweet to you

Stop, in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop, in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Think it over, think it over

I've known of your, your secluded nights
I've even seen her maybe once or twice
But is her sweet expression
Worth more than my love and affection?

But this time before you leave my arms
And rush off to her charms
(Think it over)
Haven't I been good to you?
(Think it over)
Haven't I been sweet to you?

Stop, in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop, in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Think it over, think it over

I've tried so hard, hard to be patient
Hoping you'd stop this infatuation
But each time you are together
I'm so afraid, I'll be losing you forever

Stop, in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop, in the name of love
Before you break my heart

Stop, in the name of love
Before you break my heart

Think it over, baby

Saw a cop on the line

My mind broke
The cop he choked
Get out of here, boy, or I'll use the colt

No chance, no chance
You sure look fine your shoes they shine
No heat can compete with this blue-eyed liar
The child spoke, we ain't got a hope

Press the button, it's all remote

257,Slipping Away,"[Verse 1]
Was I running backwards
Or was it all just a dream
It was a beautiful morning
It was all I could see
Should I ask for an antidote?
Should I ask her to take it slow?
I don't know
I should offer an anecdote
About some place I used to go
My M.O

It's you sometimes it's you
It's true sometimes it's true
We were just born slipping
Slipping away

[Verse 2]
Am I running backwards?
Or am I just still asleep
And I'm right in the middle
Of a beautiful dream
You were listening on a stethoscope
Asking me to take it slow
But I don't know
I'm looking for an antidote
Something to speed it up or make it slow
Before you know…

It's true sometimes it's true

Now Dre want to switch sides, tricks hide in war
Last year, I'd shed tears, but I don't cry no more
Plus Jay-Z tried to play me, won't last long
Go ask King Sun how it feel to have your ass gone
Listen Doo-Wop, don't get your shit knocked, you can't win
Tell 'em all to let the games begin, we havin' war games

Yeah nigga, y'all niggas can't fade this shit
Got shot 5 times, got out of jail on bail
And sold 5 million
Sold more records then all you trick motherfuckers put together
More than the Firm, more than Bad Boy, more than Mobb Deep
More than all you bitch made niggas

[Verse 2: Napoleon]
Now won't you just, signal me
Before you try to take another one of my folks
Took they breath so they choke
And I know I did a lot of dirt
But grand said it wouldn't hurt
My death is comin', 'cause I feel it, smell it
When I work, did you see me
Comin' up I tried to take it easy
Plan at the wrong place, at the wrong time
I leave you with a broken mind
Ya whole block is fucked
Whole family is cryin', when the guns go bust
I went from Jersey to Cali, nigga
I seen it all, when niggas get they head busted
And didn't fall

[Verse 3: E.D.I. Amin]
Huh, yeah
I be that young nigga, EDI, Amin, huh
Rappers is fixin' to come up short
If y'all don't come clean
Check it, I'm at home watchin', shittin', sittin'
And I see some niggas on a T.V. line, what a pity
Ain't nothin' but a copy, of a copy
Reincarnation of an imitation, sloppy
Don't even know you got these white folks laughin' at cha
How the hell, you gonna base your lifestyle after a movie character
I'm dumpin' back at cha
Huh, fully loaded and you can quote it
Thug niggas casket is ridin' roll it

[Verse 4: Young Noble]
I'm hell-bound, One Nation
My destination is jail bound
Penetration to get ya niggas shot down, it's my town
Put your B'9s and Glocks down
Outlawz drop down
Shuttin' your whole spot down
We rock towns daily
Sippin' on the Baileys with thug passion
Mashin' with Mr. Makaveli, so tell me
Which one of y'all niggas want the war to be civilized?
Ill as Killa Keise and I be cockin' in your enterprise
Criminalize, thoughts
When I be thinkin' draw fast, haul ass
When you see a nigga reachin' for what, the heater
Back streets I know, critically in Italy
Like Bellissimo
But down in Mexico, policio try to track me
Transform my Jersey army to some Killa' Cali
Khaki so Kadafi back me

[Verse 5: Yaki Kadafi]
Ehhhhhhhh yoooooo
They wanna strangle me and trap me
Angle to angle, blast me (ride on these bitches)
So you niggas can't match me (hehe)
When it comes to the chips (that's right)
We flip and cock back like a fifth
(Eh yo, Kadafi keep a gat on these, while I do it)

[Verse 6: 2Pac]
After the fire comes the rain, after pleasure there's pain
Even though we broke for the moment, we'll be ballin' again
Time to make it yo; my military be prepared for them bustaz
Similar to, niggas that scary, get too near me we rushin'
Visions of over-packed prisons, visions and niggas thug livin'
Pressures, three strikes, I hope they don't test us
They pull the heater ammunition in crates, ssshhh
Move without a sound, as we slide down, pistols in place
They got me fiendin' for currency, the money be callin'
It's like I'm - dreamin', seeing scenes of me ballin'
Participated in felonious behavior
Cock the cocked fo'-five, snatchin' niggas pagers
Labelled a mark soon as we start, it was hard to quit
We started out drinkin' 40's, moved to harder shit
God damn now I'm a grown man, I follow no one
Nigga got my own plan, WATCH ME, uh

[Outro 2Pac and Yaki Kadafi]

When you choose to lose yourself
Who knows what you might find
And once the journey's done
It won't seem quite so far
After a million miles or so
We'll find out who we are

Follow wherever the wind starts blowing

[ALADDIN]
A million miles away
The kind of life people dream of knowing

[JASMINE]
A million miles away

[BOTH]
We'll never turn back we'll just keep on going
Vanishing from the view
Becoming someone new
We'll be a million miles away
Leave everything behind
When you choose to lose yourself
Who knows what you might find
And once the journey's done
We'll have no need to roam
After a million miles or so
We might find out we're home

After a million miles or so
We might find out we're home",Alan Menken,1983,"[98, 82, 88]",3

Seen all them Instagram pictures you post
So I already know what it is

273,Affair Of The Heart,"You say we're in love
Well I don't know how to tell you
It's not the way it seems
And you think you really love me
And you're waiting for the earthquake
You've been feeling in your dreams
And though I might send you flowers
Enjoy your company
Even call you every day when we're apart
When all is said and done
All it is, is a simple affair of the heart

I can give you up any time I want to...
(love is a drug but it won't take hold)
I can give you up any time I need to...
(you make it hard, but I'm in control)
Sometimes I think
I was a fool to let it start
I'm at the point of no return
I might even lose my heart
I might even lose my heart

You're making me crazy
Till I don't know what I'm saying
It's coming out confused
And I don't really need you, no

You're just another heartache
I wish I could refuse
And though I might seem obsessive
'cos I want you constantly
Don't go thinking
That it's something that it's not
When all is said and done
All it is, is a simple affair of the heart

'cos I can give you up any time I want to...
(love is a drug but it won't take hold)
Yes, I can give you up any time I need to...

274,Always Something There To Remind Me,"[Verse 1]
I walk along those city streets
You used to walk along with me
And every step I take recalls
How much in love we used to be

[Chorus]
Oh, how can I forget you
When there is always something there to remind me?
Always something there to remind me
I was born to love you
And I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me, whoa-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
When shadows fall, I pass a small café
Where we would dance at night
And I can't help recalling
How it felt to kiss and hold you tight

[Chorus]
Oh, how can I forget you
When there is always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me
I was born to love you
And I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh

[Verse 3]
If you should find you miss
The sweet and tender love
We used to share
Just come back to the places
Where we used to go
And I'll be there

Oh, how can I forget you
When there is always something there to remind me?
When there is always something there to remind me
I was born to love you

Hands, don't let her go
Cause then the midnight icy winds will blow

But honey, prices have shot through the sky
So I fixed up the basement with what I was a-workin' with
Stocked it full of jelly jars and heavy equipment

Walk into the bank, try to pass that trash
Teller sees and says, ""Uh-huh, that's fresh as grass""
See the street pass under your feet
In time to buy the latest model getaway Jeep

Stocked it full of jelly jars and heavy equipment

You let all my friends come over and meet
And you were so strange

That it hurt me so

Used to be the quiet kid in the sandbox

You oughta stop me coming in again
You mad? You thought we were synonyms?
Too bad, that's the water you're gettin' in
You're too fat for the sharks that you're swimming in
From where I'm sitting, contenders are lookin'
Like fruit spinnin' around in a blender
Hardly a snack when I'm here lookin' for dinner
I eat 'em, delete 'em, they're barely beginners
Main course is my main sport
Play major, but Minor's my main Fort
Put a chain around everything I came for
Look, but don't touch, sucker
Tell 'em take an I.O.U

Say they want respect now
Thinking they deserve to have it next now
Tell 'em take an I.O.U
Believing what they're makin' up
Talking loud, but never really sayin' much
Tell 'em take an I.O.U

And they think I'm givin' them a handout
Tell 'em take an I.O.U
Thinking they're entitled to a piece, no, I don't think so
Tell 'em take an I.O.U

[Verse 2]
Levitatin' in the blackout
Used to drink at least a forty 'fore we mashed out
Used to think that workin' forty was a max-out
Now I'm workin' even when I'm sleepin', do the math now
'Cause even when I'm sleepin', eyes keep 'em open
Stripe across 'em both the color of your hemoglobin
A huge act man like I'm known for being Logan
X-23 I’m keen to leave 'em with a femur broken
Takin' it too far, maybe
Friends like “Mike, I don't know who you are lately”
But pride and hate has made naysayers mistake me
For wasting brain space on ratings they gave me
I don't need your respect, I got history

Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a ringing a bell

[Chorus]
Go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 2]
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by they would stop and say
Oh my, but that little country boy could play

[Chorus]
Go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go
Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 3]
His mother told him ""Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying 'Johnny B. Goode Tonight'""

283,Roll Me Away,"[Verse 1]
Took a look down a westbound road
Right away I made my choice
Headed out to my big two-wheeler
I was tired of my own voice
Took a bead on the northern plains
And just rolled that power on

[Verse 2]
Twelve hours out of Mackinac City
Stopped in a bar to have a brew
Met a girl and we had a few drinks
And I told her what I'd decided to do
She looked out the window a long long moment
Then she looked into my eyes
She didn't have to say a thing
I knew what she was thinkin'

[Chorus]
Roll, roll me away
Won't you roll me away tonight
I too am lost, I feel double-crossed
And I'm sick of what's wrong and what's right
We never even said a word
We just walked out and got on that bike
And we rolled
And we rolled clean out of sight

[Verse 3]
We rolled across the high plains
Deep into the mountains
Felt so good to me
Finally feelin' free
Somewhere along a high road
The air began to turn cold
She said she missed her home
I headed on alone, oh!

[Verse 4]
Stood alone on a mountain top
Starin' out at the Great Divide
I could go east, I could go west
It was all up to me to decide
Just then I saw a young hawk flyin'
And my soul began to rise
And pretty soon
My heart was singin'

[Chorus]
Roll, roll me away
I'm gonna roll me away tonight
Gotta keep rollin', gotta keep ridin'
Keep searchin' till I find what's right
And as the sunset faded I spoke
To the faintest first starlight
And I said next time

287,Don't Pay The Ferryman,"It was late at night on the open road
Speeding like a man on the run
A lifetime spent preparing for the journey
He is closer now and the search is on
Reading from a map in the mind
Yes there's that ragged hill and there's a boat on the river

And when the rain came down, he heard a wild dog howl
There were voices in the night
Don't do it
Voices out of sight
Don't do it
Too many men have failed before, whatever you do

[Chorus]
Don't pay the ferryman
Don't even fix a price
Don't pay the ferryman
Until he gets you to the other side

In the rolling mist, then he gets on board
Now there'll be no turning back
Beware that hooded old man at the rudder
And then the lightning flashed and the thunder roared
And people calling out his name
And dancing bones that jabbered-and-a-moaned on the water

And then the ferryman said There is trouble ahead
So you must pay me now
Don't do it

288,The Metro,"[Verse 1]
I'm alone
Sitting with my empty glass
My four walls
Follow me through my past
I was on a Paris train
I emerged in London rain
And you were waiting there
Swimming through apologies

[Chorus]
I remember searching for the perfect words
I was hoping you might change your mind
I remember a soldier sleeping next to me
Riding on the Metro

[Verse 2]
You wore white
Smiling as you took my hand
So removed
We spoke of wintertime in France
Minutes passed with shallow words
Years have passed and still the hurt
Oh, I can see you now
Smiling as I pulled away

[Chorus]
I remember the letter wrinkled in my hand
""I'll love you always"" filled my eyes
I remember a night we walked along the Seine
Riding on the Metro

[Synth solo]

[Chorus]
I remember a feeling coming over me
The soldier turned, then looked away
I remember hating you for loving me
Riding on the Metro

[Verse 3]
I'm alone
Sitting with my broken glass
My four walls
Follow me through my past
I was on a Paris train
I emerged in London rain
And you were waiting there
Swimming through apologies
Sorry

I was hoping you might change your mind

I guess I should've known by the way you parked your car sideways
That it wouldn't last
See, you're the kinda person that believes in makin' out once
Love 'em and leave 'em fast
I guess I must be dumb 'cuz you had a pocket full of horses
Trojan and some of them used

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right
And you say - ""What have I got to lose?""

[Chorus]
And honey, I say Little Red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast (Oh)
Little Red Corvette
You need a love that's gonna last

[Verse 2]
I guess I should've closed my eyes when you drove me to the place
Where your horses run free
'Cause I felt a little ill when I saw all the pictures
Of the jockeys that were there before me
Believe it or not, I started to worry
I wondered if I had enough class

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right
And you say - ""Baby, have you got enough gas?""
Oh yeah!

[Chorus]
Little Red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast (Yes you are)

You need to find a love that's gonna last (Oh, oh)

290,We Two,"When we two parted
     In silence and tears,
Half broken-hearted
     To sever for years,
Pale grew thy cheek and cold
     Colder thy kiss;
Truly that hour foretold
     Sorrow to this.

The dew of the morning
     Sunk chill on my brow--
It felt like the warning
     Of what I feel now.
Thy vows are all broken,
     And light is thy fame;
I hear thy name spoken,
     And share in its shame.

They name thee before me,
     A knell to mine ear;
A shudder comes o'er me--
     Why wert thou so dear?
They know not I knew thee,
     Who knew thee too well--
Long, long shall I rue thee,
     Too deeply to tell.

In secret we met--
     In silence I grieve,
That thy heart could forget,
     Thy spirit deceive.
If I should meet thee
     After long years,
How should I greet thee?--
     With silence and tears.",Lord Byron,1983,"[91, 65, 47, 29, 22, 22, 24, 27, 32, 45, 57, 74]",12

292,Overkill,"I can't get to sleep
I think about the implications
Of diving in too deep
And possibly the complications
Especially at night
I worry over situations
I know will be all right
Perhaps it's just imagination

And day after day it reappears
And night after night my heartbeat shows the fear
Ghosts appear and fade away

Alone between the sheets
Only brings exasperation
It's time to walk the streets
Smell the desperation
At least there's pretty lights
And though there's little variation
It nullifies the night
From overkill

Day after day it reappears
Night after night my heartbeat shows the fear
Ghosts appear and fade away
Come back another day

Would you date me on the regular? (Tell me, would you?)

But I ain't seen myself another girl (Like you)

But there's just one thing I need from you (Saying ""I do"")

And made you smile at every word I wrote (What would you do?)
Would that make you wanna change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team? (Tell me, would you?)
See, what's the point in waitin' anymore?

I'm patient, but I ain't gon' try (Nah)
You don't come, I ain't gon' die
Hold up, what you mean you can't go? Why? (Why?)
Me and your boyfriend, we ain't no tie (Uh-huh)
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high (Man)

What's better than tripping is falling in love
What's better than Letterman, Leno, Fallon, and all the above
What's better than popping bottles trying to ball in the club
Is the first caveman pops with his son, ball and a club
What's better than paper is ballin' it up
What's better than followers is actually fallin' in love
What's better than frolicking, follies, fallin' in mud
Rolling in green pastures, wanderin', followin' love
What's better than eating is feeding your fam
What's better than meetings is missing meetings to meet with your fam
What's better than leaning and needing a Xan
Is hitting your xan dreaming a dream could mean leaving the land
What's better than yelling is hollerin' love
What's better than rhymes, nickels, dimes and dollars and dubs
Is dialing up your darling just for callin' her up

Down with the sound called BDP

Pick any dick for the flavor that you savor
Mr. Magic might wish to come and try to save ya
But instead of helping ya out he wants the same thing I gave ya
I finally figured it out, Magic mouth is used for sucking
Roxanne Shante is only good for steady fucking
MC Shan and Marley Marl is really only bluffing
Like Doug E. Fresh said “I tell you now, you ain't nothing”
Compared to Red Alert on KISS and Boogie Down Productions
So easy now man, I me say easy now man

Me moving over there and then me moving over here

Don't know you know that he's out of touch
What's the matter with your DJ, MC Shan?

As sweet as any harmony
Mmm - but she blinded me with science

I can smell the chemicals
(Blinding me with science) - science!)

And when she turned her eyes to me
As deep as any ocean
As sweet as any harmony
She blinded me with science

And failed me in geometry
When she's dancing next to me
(Blinding me with science) - science!
I can hear machinery
(Blinding me with science) - science!

It's poetry in motion
And now she's making love to me
The spheres're in commotion
The elements in harmony
She blinded me with science
(She blinded me with science!)
And hit me with technology

(Good heavens Miss Sakamoto - you're beautiful!)
I don't believe it!
There she goes again!
She's tidied up, and I can't find anything!
All my tubes and wires
And careful notes
And antiquated notions

But! - it's poetry in motion
And when she turned her eyes to me
As deep as any ocean
As sweet as any harmony

Love does not boast
Love after all
Matters the most

Love does not hide

And love never fails you

Love will sustain
Love will provide
Love will not cease
At the end of time

Love will protect
Love always hopes
Love still believes
When you don't

Love is the arms that are holding you
Love never fails you

When my heart won't make a sound
When I can't turn back around
When the sky is falling down
Nothing is greater than this
Greater than this

'Cause love is right here
Love is alive
Love is the way
The truth, the life

Love is the arms that are holding you
And love is the place you will fly to

309,Stranger In My House,"[Verse 1]
I don't understand
You look just like the man
In the picture by our bed
The suspence is pounding and clouding up my head
I'm checkin' your clothes
And you wear the same size shoes
You sleep in his spot
And you're driving his car
But I don't know just who you are

[Chorus 1]
There's a stranger in my house
It took a while to figure out
There's no way you could be who you say you are
You gotta be someone else
Cuz he wouldn't touch me like that
And he wouldn't treat me like you do
He would adore me, he wouldn't ignore me
So I'm convinced there's a stranger in my house

[Verse 2]
I'm not sure who you are
Don't see your shadow around when you walk
You leave with no kisses
Goodbye with no words
If these walls could talk
They would have nothing to tell

So what could it be?
Is there someone immitating me?
Could she be taking my place?
Look me in the face
And tell me that I'm wrong
When I say

[Chorus 2]
There's a stranger in my house (There's a stranger in my house)
It took a while to figure out (It took a while to figure out)
There's no way you could be who you say you are (Ooooh)

Tell me where we first kissed
Tell me where my spot is
Tell me if I liked it, loved it
Or could it be
That the stranger is me
Have I changed so drastically?
Is it I want more for me?
And you remain the same

And if I give it a twist
Something to hold when I lose my grip
Will I find something in there?

Another one to deceive?

And if you open up wide
And if you let me inside

Fuck around wanna fight like this, take a hike like this
I might just, might just, I don't know

Want so much more than this third-dimension
That's not to mention my true ascension is a bigger picture
No metaphor, I’m being real with ya
But it will hit ya like, ""goddamn!""
Going HAM, full of all of them
In a spaceship, I’m in another system
So futuristic, on another mission
But back on Earth everybody bitchin', I been in the kitchen
Livin' my life—no inhibition, life to death with no intermission
Now the good book said we all the same, and we kill each other but it's all in vain
And we all to blame, can't see the picture when it's out the frame
Real talk, I wanna grip the grain and just ride with ya, build a family then die richer
When ya get to heaven I'ma come and get ya
Sit back and really get the picture
This life, yeah, it done ate away, hard times never stayed away
But one thing I know day to day, I'ma do somethin' 'fore I fade away

313,Never Tell An Angel (When Your Heart's On Fire),"A couple years ago, I was told a story about a soldier who was set on fire and burned to death because he was gay. After that, I started reading similar stories about people in the GLBTQ community who were tortured or killed by being set on fire and burned. I couldn’t stop thinking about the people who had died that way and couldn’t stop wondering what they might say from where they are now.

The night I was torn from the pages of their Bible
and burned alive
my ashes came down like snow
and a girl who had never seen my face
saw me falling from the sky
and laid down on her back
to make an angel in the powder of my bones.

From heaven, I watched her,
‘though my eyes were still aflame,
and my ribs were still blue.
They didn’t win, I whispered, as her arms built my wings.
They didn’t win.
Look at that moon.
It is a pebble in my hand
Tonight, I could skip it across that fog-drunk sea
to the lashes accordion in the night
and all they know of hate
is that it couldn’t beat the love out of me…

that when they dropped me to the grave,
I fell like a bucket in to a well
and came up full;
carving my lover’s name
into the skin of a weeping willow
that had spent its entire life laughing at the rain.

Hold me like a lantern;
staircase my spine
When they bring the children to my funeral
to scream “FAGGOT” at my dust
tell them I was born in to their casket
but I wouldn’t pull the splinters from my heartany more than Christ would’ve pulled the thorns
from his crimson head.

They can come a thousand times
with their burning matches and their gasoline,
with their hungry laws
and their empty mouths full of prayers to that God
who greeted me at His gates with His throat full of trumpets
and His tears full of shame
as his trembling palms collected the cinders
of His children’s crime.

I know what holy is
I know that the soul is shaped like a bowl;
I know the lies we try to fill it with
and we spill too often
the orchards inside.

But my lover’s shoes were tied with guitar strings
and when I walked beside
there was a silo in my chest,
there was a field full of sun.
there was a river full of gold that we left
to pick our sweet hearts from the trees
that kept uprooting tombstones
so the names of the dead would crumble into poems.

Write me down like this:
Say my ashes never made the news.
Say the jury was full of shotguns.
Then say the snow that fell on the tip of your tongue
refused to melt away.
Say this to the kids hiding their heartbeats
from their father’s fists.

I planted the garden of my kiss.
I opened the night with my teeth.
I loved so hard that when they pressed their ear to the track
the train they hear coming will still be my chest,
a rumbling harpoon,
a sky they can not bury.

Look at that moon.
I am a pebble in her hand;
a harmonica held to the mouth of the river
where nothing ever
burns.",Andrea Gibson,1983,"[100, 93, 88, 89]",4
314,Photograph,"[Verse 1]
Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken

Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves

Holding me close until our eyes meet

Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen

Who will dance on the floor in the round?""
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor, in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"" (Hee-eeh)

For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, hee!
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (Ah-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby crying, his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby

People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do

Girls calling cabs at dawn quarter to seven

Rockin with our city like a sold out show
House full of pros that specialize in the ho'in
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Order plane tickets

Watch they image start to lessen

[Intro]
Come on Eileen!
Come on Eileen!

[Verse 1]
Poor old Johnnie Ray
Sounded sad upon the radio
Moved a million hearts in mono
Our mothers cried
Sang along, who'd blame them?
You've grown (You’re grown up!)
So grown (So grown up!)

My thoughts (I confess)
Verge on dirty

These people round here
Were beaten down, eyes sunk in smoke-dried face
They're so resigned to what their fate is
But not us (No never)
But not us (Not ever)
We are far too young and clever
(Remember)
Too-ra-loo-ra, too-ra-loo-rye, ay
And you'll hum this tune forever, oh

[Chorus]
Come on Eileen
Oh, I swear (What he means)
Aah, come on let's
Take off everything

329,Rio,"[Intro]
Luke White on the beat

[Verse]
You ever seen a nigga hung with a gold chain?
I'd rather sing about the same things that we claim
Such is bashful, but niggas like the task force
Mobbin' on the streets and robbin' stores in ski masks, bruh
Niggas ask for peace in a riot and bring violence
'Cause it's a game of cat and mouse and you gon' bleed silent
What's the justice in sayin', ""Fuck it,"" and grab the pump?
Then kill a woman with many children makes you a chump
Look at all the stores you wreckin', nigga I reckon
Think about the people who own it for about a second
I know you got your problems, but brother, they got theirs
This is not a game, quit violence and grow a pair
But yo, you'd rather hear me say, ""Fuck the black prejudice
Let's murder different races, grow hatred, and form irrelevant
Views"" and etcetera, knives thrown
Damage 'em, lives blown, oblivion hole cold, oblivious
I won't dare say that you should stop the fuckin' ignorance
Murder ops, killin' shit, I'd enjoy the thrill of it
Bathe in blood of officers, different corpses, offin' 'em
Auction 'em, don't you bark at 'em
Murder 'em, never heard of 'em
I could preach the peace but say, ""Fuck it,"" and preach the murder
'Cause this ain't fuckin' life that we livin'
Go ahead and grab the extension
Grab another one: uncle, cousin, brother, son
Glory to all the chosen ones that will rid you of the innocence
But in a sense, innocent will soon behold the ignorance
Blasphemous, killin' our own, murderin' black—

[Outro]
We see, I see, death before the children
White guys and white girls hanging from the buildings
We hate niggers!
We hate Jews!
We hate faggots!
And we hate spics!
Hooray!
We don't have to have a reason to hate them
Just because they breathe we hate their filthy bums!
You people need to get off your ass and wake up
This is America, the niggers are taking it over and the Jews
Make a stand, join the klan
White power! White power! White power!
And I hate Jews! I hate them because they exist!
I hate them because they breathe!
I hate them because they're scum!
The goddamn niggers are the scum of the Earth!

330,When I'm With You,"[Verse 1]
Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
And sometimes we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side
And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you

[Chorus]
I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only tryna let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

[Verse 2]
Just a small town boy and girl
Living in a crazy world
Tryna figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
The secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all nobody gets me like you do
And you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me

[Chorus]
I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only tryna let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

[Bridge]
When I'm with anybody else it's so hard to be myself
Only you can tell

That I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do

Might look light, but we heavy though
You think Drake will pull some shit like that? You never know
Million-dollar meetings in a Polo Lounge

Tell Lucian I said ""fuck it,"" I'm tearin' holes in my budget
Bag her like we in Publix, and take her ass out in public
Ordered her the filet, told 'em, ""Butterfly it, she'll love it.""
She used to soda and nuggets, she really just out here thuggin'

340,Dancing In The Shadows,"Talking to a friend I turned around
And saw a total stranger
Hiding out for safety’s sake I found
I put myself in danger
There must be someway I can try to find
An answer to the questions in my mind
Or will I have to always spend my time
Dancing in the shadows
Dancing in the shadows
I saw somebody earning more and more
But he was getting poorer
It seems to me the more things that you know
The less you can be sure of
There must be someway I can try to find
An answer to the questions in my mind
Or will I have to always spend my time
Dancing in the shadows
Dancing in the shadows

Ooh I’m looking for a straight line
Can’t sleep at night

Time
I've been passing time watching trains go by

Lying on the sand watching sea birds fly
Wishing there would be someone waiting home for me
Something's telling me it might be you

All of my life

Looking back as lovers go walking past
All of my life
Wondering how they met and what makes it last
If I found the place, would I recognize the face?
Something's telling me it might be you
Yeah, it's telling me it might be you

So many quiet roads to take
So many dreams to make
And with so much love to make

Maybe all we need is time

I've been saving love songs and lullabies
And there's so much more
No one's ever heard before

You're the main attraction but your heads in a swirl
You look for action in your everyday world
Some satisfaction; you're not just another girl
You can't always find it

You know where I'm goin' tonight
You can find me where it feels alright

I'm not about to watch you walk away
I thought Id walk away from you someday

Baby, please let go
You make it harder this way

Oh Baby, please don't go
Unless you mean it this time
Id really want to stop you but I couldn't say no
I couldn't say no...

I get the feeling you're not willing to try
Its so revealing in the way you satisfy

You smiled at me but you had nothing to say
That was some kind
Some kind of friend you turned out to be

Nothing could drag me down
I lived and I loved what I did

Alone in the light of the moon
A change comes over me

How can I stand this lunacy
Feeding my dark desires?
Look at the nighttime sky, you fool
It’s a fool moon fire

Day after day, it’s no use
At night there’s something changed
I just gotta play it loose
Be cool, but it’s getting strange

I know it won’t be long
Before the world can see
Alone in the light of moon
My mad lycanthropy

How can I stand this lunacy
Feeding my dark desires?
Look at the nighttime sky, you fool

It’s so, so hard to say
Sometimes darkness beats
Defeats the light of day

Feeding my dark desires?
Look at the nighttime sky, you fool
It’s a fool moon fire

How can I stand this lunacy
Feeding my dark desires?
Look at the nighttime sky, you fool

What happened

I need a sec, you think we could wind this up?
Ohh, give me time, I'll make this right
I will rewind and forget what it's like
To lie awake, laying beside you
Staring in each other's eyes, two
Months before you found a better guy
When I thought I knew, found a better lie, every time
You know I thought I could let it slide, but I can't even recognize you

[Chorus]
I never thought I'd be so wrong
Lying beside me like you thought I'd never know
I never thought I'd be so wrong, so wrong, so wrong

[Verse 2]
I need a love, but I can't find my heart
It's left in your palms when you thought I was enough
Just tell me did you go and find the love of your life
As I gave you everything of mine
You've taken away what keeps me alive
Did it ever cross your mind?
So don't you come back again
Knocking on my door with your arrogance
You're venomous, I won't let you in
So turn around and go back to him

[Chorus]
I never thought I'd be so wrong
Lying beside me like you thought I'd never know
I never thought I'd be so wrong, so wrong, so wrong

This feeling in my chest seems so absurd
When I can't wake up next to her
Just tell the truth was he the first, ah?

Lying beside me like you thought I'd never know

The lights came on bright
Years of heavy weight
In a moment turned light
I'd thought love could only look
Dark as if through a glass
I just turned into an open book
Reading easy at last

Tonight my walls came down
Like a brick through a plate glass window
With a wrecking ball sound
Like old Jericho
Laid swift to the ground
I'm not sure when, but baby you're how
The walls came down

I've never trusted much
Got my reasons like most
Stayed well protected from
Every thorn on each rose
Taking those wayward trips
Only to turn back and run
Sailing all my relationships
Could not have dreamed up this one

Tonight my walls came down
Like a brick through a plate glass window
With a wrecking ball sound
Like old Jericho
Laid swift to the ground
I'm not sure when, but baby you're how
The walls came down

You make sense to me
In a world where just a few things do make sense to me
In your heart I'll put my trust
Through whatever is in front of us

Tonight my walls came down
Like a brick through a plate glass window
With a wrecking ball sound
Like old Jericho
Laid swift to the ground
I'm not sure when, but baby you're how
The walls came down
Ooh baby you're how the walls came down

And I gave it all to you

Oh these people I'm talking to don't understand
They don't seem to realize
They're listening but they're not hearing me

Any kind of feeling that I had is gone
Because I gave it all, it's gone
And I gave it all to you
Now I'm living on borrowed time, but it's mine

Oh, d'you hear me?
I cannot believe it's true
Are you really doing the things you do
No I cannot believe it's you, really you

Over and over I keep on telling myself
Over and over I hope I'm gonna make up
Over and over I know it's really happening
And there's nothing that I can say
Because nothing can change all the things that you've done to me
Nothing can make me stay
Oh, Because you know I cannot believe it's true
Are you really doing the things you do
No I cannot believe it's you, really you

I know it's a crying shame, it's all the same to you
It seems all so well laid out but I cannot get through

And I found a better life than what we had
Even now I wake up crying in the middle of the night
And I can't believe it still could hurt so bad

Even now, when I have come so far
I wonder where you are
I wonder why it's still so hard without you
Even now, when I come shinin' through
I swear I think of you
And how I wish you knew
Even now

Even now, when I never hear your name
And the world has changed so much since you've been gone
Even now I still remember and the feeling's still the same
And this pain inside of me goes on and on
Even now

Even now, when I have come so far

Here we stand
Worlds apart, hearts broken in two, two, two
Sleepless nights
Losing ground, I'm reaching for you, you, you
Feeling that it's gone, can't change your mind
If we can't go on to survive the tide, love divides

[Chorus]
Someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you, one night will remind you
How we touched and went our separate ways
If he ever hurts you, true love won't desert you
You know I still love you
Though we touched and went our separate ways

[Verse 2]
Troubled times
Caught between confusion and pain, pain, pain – distant eyes
Promises we made were in vain, in vain, in vain
If you must go, I wish you love
You'll never walk alone, take care, my love
Miss you, love

Someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you, one night will remind you
How we touched and went our separate ways
If he ever hurts you, true love won't desert you
You know I still love you
Though we touched and went our separate ways

Oh, someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you, one night will remind you
If he ever hurts you, true love won't desert you

That his eternal fate has turned its back on him

It's two A.M., the fear has gone

Maybe my connection is tired of takin' chances

Yeah, there's a storm on the loose, sirens in my head
Wrapped up in silence, all circuits are dead
Cannot decode, my whole life spins into a frenzy

Help, I'm steppin' into the Twilight Zone
Place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far?

Double crossed messenger all alone
Can't get no connection, can't get through
Where are you?

Well the night weighs heavy on his guilty mind
This far from the borderline
When the hitman comes
He knows damn well he has been cheated

And he says, ""Help, I'm steppin' into the Twilight Zone
Place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned
My beacon's been moved under moon and star

[Verse 1]
Imagine the Word of God without religious groupies
Imagine a savior born in a Mexican hooptie
Persecuted single mother in a modern manger
You'd crucify him again like a fuckin' stranger
Tears of the anger are worth more than diamonds or rubies
Imagine bein' locked up since juvie
Imagine changin' your life and still goin' out like Tookie
Imagine niggas talkin' shit when they never knew me
Imagine a movie that depicted the pain in your life
Like them kids in Afghanistan chasin' a kite
For most of the world, that's what it's like
Imagine if the woman you suppose to love for the rest of your life
Is set to marry someone else at the end of the night
They say you fight the greatest jihad in your heart and your mind
And fight the hardest when you start from behind
So I dream the impossible all the time
Fuck a Masonic design — America's future is mine
Repeat that to yourself, 'cause if culture's a crime
Them numbers tatted on your arm aren't too far behind
They can only conquer you after they've murdered your mind
So rise up, motherfucker, like the sign of the times
I feel my body weakenin', but my spirit is fine
Ready to go to war with devils at the drop of a dime
And fight with my rebel army until the stars are aligned

[Break: Lakota]

[Verse 2]
Nostradamus was a white man's prophet
Who predicated European supremacist logic
Because the pilgrims and Conquistador columns
Killed more innocent people than Hitler and Stalin
I guess the fortune-tellers skipped an antichrist or two
Brother, give this to the OG's doin' life with you
And pray for the problems with the Pope psychology
So the Vatican will offer an apology (for what?)
For destroyin' the people's liberation theology
Snatchin' the spirit of Jesus from people in poverty
Business decisions like keepin' people in prisons
But had the opposite effect: incarceratin' religion
That type of crooked politics imposed on a populous
Is obvious if you read the Northwood documents
Forget the compliments for what I recorded
And live for revolution instead of always dyin' for it
Remember a bullet can never stop me
My legions are led by the spirit Haile Selassie, watch me
Even if I'm shot in the chakra, I will prosper
Doppler effect, bumpin' music out a helicopter
Tellin' the Persians, ""Dig up Zoroaster!""
And tell them I came back as the son of the Ahura Mazda
Fish out the Philistine Dagon from the shores of Gaza
And call Quetzalcoatl flyin' over La Raza
This is my message to the older gods
I'll sacrifice you all to the revolution, like the Romanovs
Lost in the desert like the Hebrews of Israel
The blood clot system tried to kill me like sickle-cell
But I survived, and I'm alive to fight another day
Cocooned in a coma, I can still hear my mother pray
Sister cryin' out to God, ""Please let my brother stay!""
Walkin' towards the light, but somethin' is pullin' me the other way

On their tours
And in their homes

And takes her tea

372,Wind Him Up,"Aldo's standing at his table
He's wondering if he's able
To pick the number right this time
He watches as the wheel stops spinning
Sees the number that is winning
As he reaches for his glass of wine

Once he starts it's hard to stop
He's keeping up a pace like a tight wound clock
Be sure you don't step in his way
He'll keep those numbers rolling
This may be his last day

As all the bets are taken
Aldo lights a smoke, he's shakin'
From carnation right to the ground
He knows tonight holds one last chance
He gives the wheel a final glance
Slippery fingers drop the money down

Once he starts it's hard to stop
He's keeping up a pace like a tight wound clock
And as he leaves the table (no luck today?)
You can rest assured
He's coming back to try again

Wind him up, he can't stop
He's wound up tight just like the clock
That's winding its second hand down
Wind him up, he can't stop
He keeps on going 'round the clock

374,Take The Short Way Home,"[Intro: Marvelous Mosell & Dionne Warwick]
Shiiit
Take the short way home
Tag den korte vej hjem, natten er slem, glem det ikke
Take the short way home
Barylere på kanyler, varulve hyler
Take the short way home
Take the short way home
Tag den korte vej hjem, tag den- tag den- tag den korte vej hjem

[Vers 1]
Du vågner på en kold trappesten kvart i fire
Tonny og Bo må være skredet med de piger
Du' stadig skæv, det er mørkt og du stirrer
Rundt i gaden, cyklernes styr ligner gevirer
Dine tanker kredser kun om søvn
Og din bløde dyne, så du letter røven
Står og svajer lidt, må finde vej mod metroen
Og komme tilbage til din del af stenbroen
Trasker gennem natten, blade rasler
Bag et træ står der to voodoopræster
Hvad fa’en er det? Øjne i buskadset
Savlende flagermus kravler på stilladset
Måneskin, en kølig vind
Nervøsiteten sparker ind da du ser en stodder med et sygt sind
Stå og rulle en pind af hygiejnebind
Så du skriger, går ud af dit gode skind
Løber, flygter, spurter og sprinter
Din vejrtrækning lyder som en printer
Gispende vender du dig, taber dine vanter
Ser at du bli'r jaget af hujende knallertbander

[Bro: Marvelous Mosell & Dionne Warwick]
Take the short way home
Tag den korte vej hjem, tag den- tag den- tag den korte vej hjem

[Vers 2: Marvelous Mosell]
Du hopper over et plankeværk med stærk hjertebanken
Vrikker om på foden, mærker smerter i anklen
Du bides af en ræv med rævegalskab
Dens frådende gab resulterer i blodtab
Mens det sker når din venstre hånd
Ned i din taske fra Salamon, ta'r et kassettebånd
Med Spoonie Gee, ræven går grassat
Men du strangulerer bæstet med båndsalat (Kyyrh!)

[Bro: Marvelous Mosell & Dionne Warwick]
Veludført. Fem point til dig. Bing-bing-bing-bing-bing!
Take the short way home
Du ka’ nu skimte metrostationen cirka 500 meter længere fremme. Men istedet for at gå den lige strækning ned ad gaden, vælger du af uforklarlige årsager at gå turen igennem kloakken. Dumt, dumt valg ...

[Vers 3: Marvelous Mosell]
Dækslet fjernes, du kravler ned ad stigen
Mens du prøver på at styre klaustrofobien
For Københavns kloakker er ikk' som dem i New York
Hvor Michelangelo står på skateboard
De' mindre her, den er sat'me stram
Du må mave dig frem gennem have af slam
Der ka' spores en vis form for aggression
Da 1000 rotter angriber din skridt region
Hvilket medfører ubehagelig svie
Du crawler hysterisk til du når en stige
Kravler op på gaden, tilbage i det fri
Men alle dine pinsler er langtfra forbi

[Bro: Marvelous Mosell]
Under din nedstigning i kloakken sjoflede du din fokus og begik dig i den forkerte retning. Før var du 500 meter væk fra metroen, nu' du 700!

[Vers 4: Marvelous Mosell]
Pludselig hørte du et skingert grin
Imod dig kom en kræmmer på feriemedicin
Så du tog og sponsed' afsted som gazeller
Og gemte dig i en nærliggende cykelkæder
Fandt skjul bag en affaldspose
Og en flad citybike fra Kildemoes
Men i rummet lå der noget ondt og lured'
Nu blev der tændt for loftarmaturet
Foran dig stod den babyloniske skøge
Med skæg i hele kajen og ligned’ Søren Ryge
Fra hendes bælte dingled’ skrumpehoveder
Fra renovationsfolk og unge kustoder
Hun sa'e hun ku’ et par tricks
Og beordred' dig hen på en massagebriks
Afspændingsmusik, vammel røgelse
Hele episoden var en hamper fornøjelse
Da hun gik ind ved siden af i et hvilerum
For at ryge basilikum på en knoglechillum
Så du dit snit til at komme hjem
Og flygtede ud igennem en kattelem

[Outro: Marvelous Mosell, Dionne Warwick  & Tim Curry]
Nå, men altså ... Så kom du så oss' hen til metrostationen og kom hjem
Take the short way home
Du kom hjem, men, øh, det havde i hvert fald ikk' været nogen særlig behagelig nat
Take the short way home
Så la’ det være lærepenge til en anden gang. Tag den korte vej hjem
Take the short way home
Tag den- tag den- tag den korte vej hjem, tag den korte vej hjem
Take the short way home

Smoke killer herb till my lungs collapse
Lost two grand last night shooting craps
The I hit the Ritz and bought a few laps
Just got a letter from my old best friend
Doing twenty-five in the federal pen
Wanna come home but he said until then
Could I look over his three children
They wake em up at five am for Fruit Loops
Draped in white overalls and black boots
Used to drive a Lac sipping gin and juice
Now we need money for some chips and soups
Run around town with a sack of rocks
Polo shirt with the matching socks

I'mma grow up and be a astro-naut

Now I buy cribs on the sides of lakes
Pray to the Lord and ask why they hate
Cuz they got the nuts 'bout the size of grapes
Twenty-two inches on my dually 2 ton
And the candy paint cost eighty-five hun
Even if I'm in my swimming pool having fun
Still I stay strapped with the waterproof gun

383,The Devil Made Me Do It,"[Verse 1]
This is a warning, another cut to move on
Another beat that's so strong
Hold on and I get wicked and then some
Stir up shit as the wit gets wisdom
P-Dog comin' up, I'm straight loc
Pro-black and it ain't no joke
Comin' straight from the mob that broke shit last time
Now I'm back with a brand new sick rhyme
So black check time and tempo
Revolution ain't never been simple
Followin' the path of Mao and Fanon just
Build your brain and we'll soon make progress
Paid your dues, don't snooze or lose
They came with the masterplan that got you
So know who's opposed to the dominant dark skin
Food for thought as a law for the brother man

[Verse 2]
P-Dog with a gift from heaven
Tempo 116.7
Keeps you locked in time with the program
When I get wild I pile on dope jams
Then spit on your flag and government
Cause help the black was a concept never meant
Nigga please, foodstamps and free cheese
Can't be the cure for a sick disease
Just the way the devil had planned it
Rape then pillage everyone on the planet
Then give 'em fake gods at odds with Allah
Love thy enemy and all that hoopla
Hear close to the words I wrote
Crack, cocaine are genocide on black folk
Who in their right mind ever coulda missed this?
Damn right when you think seditious
And I move swiftly, you can't get with me
The triple six moved quick but missed me
When I came off involved in conscience
So don't ask why next time I start this

[Verse 3]
Now let's get wild, allow me to freestyle
I build and fill your mind up with know-how
A common sense, a defense the next time
A pig tried to step to this, listen
Never let someone whoop on ya
They don't belong to the set you from
Ya can't be intrigued by the leads a pig lead
Unless you don't give a fuck to be free
Keep stompin' on, I keep stompin'
Attitude but I ain't from Compton
I can't be fucked around or muffed around
I can't be held down, check the sound
And keep in tuned on point on target
The revolution won't be thwarted
A setback cause my man it's plain to see
Must end all white supremacy
So let the rhythm roll on when I kick this
Brothers gonna work it out with a quickness
And now you know just why a panther went crazy
The devil made me

Beware the beast man, for he is the
Devil's pawn. He kills for sport, or lust or greed
Yea, he will murder his brother to possess
His brother's land. Shun him, for he is the

A footprint haunts an empty floor (take my hand, take my hand)
A fading coat that I once wore (take my hand, take my hand)
Oh, a desolation where I once lived

I have seen in times gone by
I have felt
A different shadow on the wall
A stranglehold on a certain feeling

Until you've been beside a man
You don't know how he feels

Some men go slow
Some men go just where they want
Some men never go

I wasn't told you'd be this cold

I'll quote ""on the road"" like a twat
And wind my way out of the city
Finding a girl who is equally pretty won't be hard
Oh, I just had a change of heart

[Instrumental Interlude]

You smashed a glass into pieces
That's around the time I left
And you were coming across as clever
Then you lit the wrong end of your cigarette

You said I'm full of diseases
Your eyes were full of regret
And then you took a picture of your salad
And put it on the Internet

And she said, ""I've been so worried about you lately
You look shit and you smell a bit
You're mad thinking you could ever save me
Not looking like that""

You used to have a face straight out of a magazine
Now you just look like anyone
I just had a change of heart

I feel as though I was deceived
I never found love in the city
I just sat in self-pity and cried in the car
Oh I just had a change of heart

Then she said, ""I've been so worried 'bout you lately
You were fit but you're losing it
You played a part, 'this is how it starts'""

They'd dearly make us pay
For laughing in their faces and making it our way

Into each other's eyes

396,Wind Beneath My Wings,"[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
It must have been cold there in my shadow
To never have sunlight on your face
You were content to let me shine, that's your way
You always walked a step behind

[Verse 2]
So I was the one with all the glory
While you were the one with all the strength
A beautiful face without a name for so long
A beautiful smile to hide the pain

[Chorus]
Did you ever know that you're my hero
And everything I would like to be?
I can fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings

[Verse 2]
It might have appeared to go unnoticed
But I've got it all here in my heart
I want you to know, I know the truth, of course I know it
I would be nothing without you

[Chorus 2]
Did you ever know that you're my hero?
You're everything I wish I could be
I could fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings
Did I ever tell you you're my hero?
You're everything, everything I wish I could be
Oh, and I, I could fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings
Cause you are the wind beneath my wings

[Bridge]
Oh, the wind beneath my wings
You, you, you, you are the wind beneath my wings
Fly, fly, fly away, you let me fly so high
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings

[Outro]
Fly, fly, so high against the sky
So high I almost touch the sky
Thank you, thank you
Thank God for you, the wind beneath my wings",Bette Midler,1983,"[92, 65, 65, 71, 75, 82]",6

Inside each other we can hide

401,Goodnight Saigon,"We met as soul mates on Parris Island
We left as inmates from an asylum
And we were sharp, as sharp as knives
And we were so gung ho to lay down our lives

We came in spastic like tameless horses
We left in plastic as numbered corpses
And we learned fast to travel light
Our arms were heavy but our bellies were tight

We had no home front, we had no soft soap
They sent us Playboy, they gave us Bob Hope
We dug in deep and shot on sight
And prayed to Jesus Christ with all of our might

We had no cameras to shoot the landscape
We passed the hash pipe and played our Doors tapes
And it was dark, so dark at night
And we held on to each other
Like brother to brother
We promised our mothers we'd write

[Chorus]
And we would all go down together
We said we'd all go down together
Yes we would all go down together

Remember Charlie, remember Baker
They left their childhood on every acre
And who was wrong? And who was right?
It didn't matter in the thick of the fight

We held the day in the palm of our hands
They ruled the night, and the night
Seemed to last as long as six weeks
On Parris Island
We held the coastline, they held the highlands

And they were sharp, as sharp as knives
They heard the hum of our motors
They counted the rotors
And waited for us to arrive

[Chorus]
And we would all go down together
We said we'd all go down together
Yes we would all go down together",Billy Joel,1983,"[98, 86, 56, 56, 56, 61, 71]",7

Desperate But Not Serious
If I ask you difficult questions
If I make improper suggestions
Would you find that a risk to your health?
Would you put me up on the bookshelf
With the books and the plants?
Desperate but not serious
Your kisses drive me delirious
If I were kind and adoring
How would that be?
Very boring
Mister Pressman with your penknife
Always asking about my sex life
And who with and how many times?
Desperate but not serious
Your kisses drive me delirious
All the advice seems so unkind
""If you don't stop, you will go blind""
They'll tell you it's none of their business
Then console you with a big kiss on the lips
And on the back of the neck

Desperate but not serious
Your kisses drive me delirious
Desperate but not serious
Your kisses drive me delirious...

Feel like I have dated every woman in the world
Most were beautiful
Some were corporate
Worked in a little cubicle
I done some shit to some that I would never do to you
Cause some were tailor made but still wasn't suitable
Come to yours I see why you be elusive
Some took advantage off you, some were intrusive
Some put they hands on you, some were abusive
Most cheated on you must they think you were exclusive
Ain't gotta say a word, I already know it
Even if you scared to death it's ill that you never show it
I go to sleep with fear of losing you, don't wanna blow it
And I wouldn't be surprised if I did, that's typical Joe shit
I lie forever
Not only do she trust me, her body is a work of art
There's a beauty in every ugly
So for me as a friend though our past is so horrible
Together we'll never have to see em' again
I love you

I've been with every woman in this world, except a virgin chick
Some kept my soul alive just so they can murder it
We're both broken pieces, both been hurt and shit
Both took a chance on each other and it was worth the risk
She low maintenance but she deserves a grip
Give her the best of me cause she endured the worst of it
She been through so much, still she carry on
So if she comes with baggage, it's a carry-on
So in life without, I couldn't conceive
I tried to dump her one time, but she wouldn't leave
And I ain't want her to, so that was good to see
Soon as I uttered the word I damn near couldn't breathe
Been trough the run around, took her off the carousel
Still in shock that her passion's unparalleled
I know some exes must be mad as hell
But we were so broken down, we had to gel
I love you

[Chorus: Emanny]
You and I, you and I seem crazy
I would die, if you leave my life baby

I've been with every type of woman, some of the baddest ones
Some were cougars, but still they acted young
Some were gossip queens, but I ain't mad at them
You make bittersweet, today that shit matters none
Some I knew wouldn't last when that crash begun
Some played it cool, but wasn't half as fun
Some ain't over me, they just blame away
Some I ruined myself, others came that way
Some were modelesque, left, started gaining weight
Other waited to gain, but met the same fate
Some moved to the city for a change of pace
Some I never broke up with, just let it fade away
Some never witnessed love, don't know what we see in it
Was a stranger for you, so it's ill how you believe in it
Cause you done dated a few
If I'mma take a chance on love, I thank God he let me take it with you
I love you

Or is it a roller skater in some kind of headphone disguise?

She looks good in a dress but better with just my t-shirt on
We can [google?] the kinds of barbecue with friends on the front lawn
She can quote me Nina Simone but prefer De La Soul
Freestylin’ over Dilla beats while we chillin’ at home
So warm and such a good time like a ray of sunshine
So calm and such a great find girl that’s why you’re my kind
Girl you’re my kind

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Phonte]
Pardon me for this part of me you probably know
I’m not for sentiments
But to be blessed with the best and not acknowledge it seems so inconsiderate
So I wrote you a jam here it’s damn near disrespectful for me to spit on this
But I’mma do it, to clear the air about when we in the streets
Just because your girl is quiet it don’t mean that she weak and
Just because she simple it don’t mean that she cheap
It just means that we meet in perfect harmony like sheet music
So you can sang along or read it and weep

425,Carrie's Gone,"The New York Central Railroad was something in her day

The ghost of some old engineer
Walks this earth and you might hear
When looking down on all those lights
""Could I see your ticket please?""

But the echoes just go on and on and on
We send it out like our breath
And somebody takes it in, somebody takes it in
Someone

In the age of possibility, cheap gas, John Glenn and tube TV
When Martin walked many miles to stand beside Gandhi
But faith was stoned with cans and rocks
And the neighbor kid came home in a box
Now we don't believe so much of everything we hear

When it's gone it's gone
But the echoes just go on and on and on
We send it out like our breath
And somebody takes it in, somebody takes it in

Tomorrow's just too far to see
To far to know to love or grieve
Every action is received
Like a legacy
It is our legacy

Route 26 was open fields and I remember when
Now every town I pass on through
Has the same outer skin
How could he sell his father's bones
The others did but he just won't
He says ""When I am dead you can take it all
But for now just let them graze.""

When it's gone it's gone
But the echoes just go on and on and on

And somebody takes it in, somebody takes it in

427,Burning Heart,"[Verse 1]
Two worlds collide, rival nations
It's a primitive clash venting years of frustrations
Bravely we hope against all hope
There is so much at stake
Seems our freedom's up against the ropes
Does the crowd understand?
Is it East versus West or man against man?
Can any nation stand alone?

[Chorus]
In the burning Heart just about to burst
There's a quest for answers an unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night rising like a spire
In the burning heart the unmistakable fire

[Verse 2]
In the warriors code there's no surrender
Though his body says stop his spirit cries - never!
Deep in our soul a quiet ember knows it's you against you
It's the paradox that drives us on
It's a battle of wills
In the heat of attack it's the passion that kills
The victory is yours alone

[Chorus] (x3)
In the burning Heart just about to burst
There's a quest for answers an unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night rising like a spire
In the burning heart the unmistakable fire

It'll take a lifetime til sunrise
If you won't stay with me tonight
Feel your breath caress my shoulder
As your heart reads my mind
You don't have to tell me anything

To be the woman in me
It's so hard to believe
That I'm feeling so free
To be the woman in me

I might be trembling
But I'm not scared
Just my desire breaking free

433,Land Of A Thousand Dances,"The boy was in the hallway drinking a glass of tea
From the other end of the hallway a rhythm was generating
Another boy was sliding up the hallway
He merged perfectly with the hallway
He merged perfectly, the mirror in the hallway

The boy looked at Johnny, Johnny wanted to run
But the movie kept moving as planned
The boy took Johnny, he pushed him against the locker
He drove it in, he drove it home, he drove it deep in Johnny
The boy disappeared, Johnny fell on his knees
Started crashing his head against the locker
Started crashing his head against the locker
Started laughing hysterically

When suddenly Johnny gets the feeling he's being surrounded by
Horses, horses, horses, horses
Coming in in all directions
White shining silver studs with their nose in flames
He saw horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses

Do you know how to pony like bony maroney
Do you know how to twist, well it goes like this, it goes like this
Baby mash potato, do the alligator, do the alligator
And you twist the twister like your baby sister
I want your baby sister, give me your baby sister, dig your baby sister
Rise up on her knees, do the sweet pea, do the sweet pee pee
Roll down on her back, got to lose control, got to lose control
Got to lose control and then you take control
Then you're rolled down on your back and you like it like that
Like it like that, like it like that, like it like that
Then you do the watusi, yeah do the watusi
Life is filled with holes, Johnny's laying there, his sperm coffin
Angel looks down at him and says, “Oh, pretty boy
Can't you show me nothing but surrender ?”
Johnny gets up, takes off his leather jacket
Taped to his chest there's the answer
You got pen knives and jack knives and
Switchblades preferred, switchblades preferred
Then he cries, then he screams, saying
Life is full of pain, I'm cruisin' through my brain
And I fill my nose with snow and go Rimbaud
Go Rimbaud, go Rimbaud
And go, Johnny, go, and do the watusi, oh do the watusi

There's a little place, a place called space
It's a pretty little place, it's across the tracks
Across the tracks and the name of the place is you like it like that
You like it like that, you like it like that, you like it like that
And the name of the band is the
Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes
Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes

Baby calm down, better calm down
In the night, in the eye of the forest
There's a mare black and shining with yellow hair
I put my fingers through her silken hair and found a stair
I didn't waste time, I just walked right up and saw that
Up there -- there is a sea
Up there -- there is a sea
Up there -- there is a sea
The sea's the possibility
There is no land but the land
(up there is just a sea of possibilities)
There is no sea but the sea
(up there is a wall of possibilities)
There is no keeper but the key
(up there there are several walls of possibilities)
Except for one who seizes possibilities, one who seizes possibilities
(up there)
I seize the first possibility, is the sea around me
I was standing there with my legs spread like a sailor
(in a sea of possibilities) I felt his hand on my knee
(on the screen)
And I looked at Johnny and handed him a branch of cold flame
(in the heart of man)
The waves were coming in like Arabian stallions
Gradually lapping into sea horses
He picked up the blade and he pressed it against his smooth throat
(the spoon)
And let it deep in
(the veins)
Dip in to the sea, to the sea of possibilities
It started hardening
Dip in to the sea, to the sea of possibilities
It started hardening in my hand
And I felt the arrows of desire
I put my hand inside his cranium, oh we had such a brainiac-amour
But no more, no more, I gotta move from my mind to the area
(go Rimbaud go Rimbaud go Rimbaud)
And go Johnny go and do the watusi
Yeah do the watusi, do the watusi ...
Shined open coiled snakes white and shiny twirling and encircling
Our lives are now entwined, we will fall yes we're together twining
Your nerves, your mane of the black shining horse
And my fingers all entwined through the air
I could feel it, it was the hair going through my fingers
(I feel it I feel it I feel it I feel it)
The hairs were like wires going through my body
I I that's how I
That's how I
I died
(at that Tower of Babel they knew what they were after)
(they knew what they were after)
[Everything on the current] moved up
I tried to stop it, but it was too warm, too unbelievably smooth
Like playing in the sea, in the sea of possibility, the possibility
Was a blade, a shiny blade, I hold the key to the sea of possibilities
There's no land but the land

Looked at my hands, and there's a red stream
That went streaming through the sands like fingers
Like arteries, like fingers
(how much fits between the eyes of a horse?)
He lay, pressing it against his throat (your eyes)
He opened his throat (your eyes)
His vocal chords started shooting like (of a horse) mad pituitary glands
The scream he made (and my heart) was so high (my heart) pitched that nobody heard
No one heard that cry
No one heard (Johnny) the butterfly flapping in his throat
(His fingers)
Nobody heard, he was on that bed, it was like a sea of jelly
And so he seized the first
(his vocal chords shot up)
(the closest possibility)
(like mad pituitary glands)
It was a black tube, he felt himself disintegrate
(there is nothing happening at all)
And go inside the black tube, so when he looked out into the steep
Saw this sweet young thing (Fender one)
Humping on the parking meter, leaning on the parking meter

In the sheets
There was a man
Dancing around

To call my own

I can't go on

It's just the main fact you never turned your back
You kept your love strong and showed no ?
I don't think no one can your place
I know if they tried ? to the face
Although you and I sometimes fuss and fight
I know it cos your heart when I stop to recite
Baby I adore you I see you smiling
That hour glass figure always profiling
I see tears in your eyes many times cos I lie
I apologise and you still by my side

Don't let no man stop what you really wanna do
And that's your decision
Fools be on a mission
The next day they be dismissing

You once was a zero
You once was his hero
In your wildest dreams you were a sex fiend
Look here baby you all lady no doubt

Mixed with the lies they hurt all the time

[Verse 1]
I know your tears more than you cause I see them so much
That's what happens when you're here with no trust
Okay, I lied, cheated, you cried
You done worse shit and I'm still here right
And motherfuck your friends, all them hoes hating
If you're not down then what's your location
I called and checked in every night and that was not probation
They gave they two cents and we ain't ask for no donation
Man you on some other other shit
Just found out about my other other bitch
Went from I love you to you don't know who you fucking with
Fresh off a vaca' and already need another trip
She said I had enough tries
Oh, and I'm the reason that she doesn't trust guys
What's the perfect girl if it's not the perfect time
If you wanna leave fine

[Hook]
Just don't tell me you love me
You're gonna make it too hard for me
I wish you were ugly
It wouldn't be so hard to leave
Cause baby I hate to love you
I can't make up my mind
Cause right when I tell you it's over
By the end of the night I be right back in bed with you
I be right back in bed with you
So don't tell me you love me

[Verse 2]
Wishing I would've tried more, she wanted the truth
Truthfully I wish I lied more cause when I was true
All I heard was ""bye"" more, ""fuck you""
""Who is that"" and ""I don't know why"" more (Shut da fuck up)
We were picture perfect and I tore it all apart
But if I pick up all the pieces we could still be a collage
Feeling like we ended too soon
Used to stay home and do it in all the rooms
Back shots, I know what you like
Had you hitting high notes and you ain't even need no autotune
Nights I was Patron'd up
Girls dressed alike looking like they cloned up
Same nights I wouldn't pick my phone up
And you was thinking damn boy grow up
And I could still hear her leaving
Crazy when a heart breaks it never breaks even
I even found another girl that's perfect
And I'm the only reason we're not working
Cause what's the perfect girl if it's not the perfect time
And if you wanna stay fine

[Hook]
Just don't tell me you love me
You're gonna make it too hard for me
I wish you were ugly
It wouldn't be so hard to leave
Cause baby I hate to love you
I can't make up my mind
Cause right when I tell you it's over
By the end of the night I be right back in bed with you

And baby, I can't stand still (while he's holding you)
I can't stand (while he's kissing you)

So we got a little problem, baby:
How to put together love and work
If I could figure out that one, darlin'
I could save us from a world of hurt

I remember when we walked together
Makin' love on a summer night
Guess we thought that it would last forever
We were all right

But baby, I can't stand still (while he's holding you)
I can't stand still (while he's touching you)

I can take it if you need some freedom
Understand it if you miss your friends
Don't you ever try to think of me some
You never tell me where you've been

You say you haven't got another lover
You say you only want to make the scene

It's not a problem at all, whatever you like

I need a chick true talk, not fake with her walk

And I don't say nothin' to her, I let that money talk
We don't never trip much, we be shakin' it off
Win, lose, or draw, I back against the wall
I'm willing to grow, cause I've wanted it all
I'm one of a kind, she one of them dimes
Been at it for a while, we puttin' in time
I'm lovin' her thoughts, she changing my mind
We learnin' together, the stars align
Fly face, nice body, and swag crazy

444,Africa,"[Verse 1: David Paich]
I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
Her moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

[Verse 2: David Paich]
The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become

[Chorus: Bobby Kimball]
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

445,The Other Guy,"[Verse 1]
The selfish part of me needs for you to stay
Cause girl you keep a smile stretched across my face
And I would give anything now
But you would lose everything now
The way your lips move when you say my name
The smell of your hair on my pillow case
And I would give anything now
But you would lose everything now
If I'd had it my way I'd never let you walk out the door
And my heart is heavy with something that I just can't ignore

[Chorus]
Girl, I'm sitting here wondering what it is that we've done
Baby who am I to be that other guy?
Cause I've seen tables turned, a world of hurt
I'd never wanna feel twice
I know what it's like from the other side
So baby who am I to be that other guy?

[Verse 2]
This could be your home, girl, a special place
Something much more than your great escape
Girl I would give anything now
If you didn't had everything now
He doesn't have to hear that you feel the same
You tell me that your love for me will never change
Unless you change everything now
It doesn't mean anything now
If it's him that you've chosen
Then we need to stop closing the door
Cause while he's at home waiting
We can't pretend there's something more

[Chorus 2]
Girl, I'm sitting here wondering what it is that we've done
Baby who am I to be that other guy?
Cause I've seen tables turned, a world of hurt
I'd never wanna feel twice
I know what it's like from the other side...

Ooh oh, I know it's not an easy choice to make
Ooh, cause no matter what you do a heart will break

451,The Blues,"[Verse 1]
Don't wish it away
Don't look at it like it's forever
Between you and me, I could honestly say
That things can only get better

[Pre-Chorus]
And while I'm away
Dust out the demons inside
And it won't be long before you and me run
To the place in our hearts where we hide

[Chorus]
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughin' like children, livin' like lovers
Rollin' like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues

[Verse 2]
Just stare into space
Picture my face in your hands
Live for each second without hesitation
And never forget I'm your man

[Pre-Chorus]
Wait on me, girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever, I simply love you
More than I love life itself

[Chorus]
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughin' like children, livin' like lovers
Rollin' like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues

453,Heart Of The Night,"From child to youth; from youth to arduous man;
From lethargy to fever of the heart;
From faithful life to dream-dowered days apart;
From trust to doubt; from doubt to brink of ban;—
Thus much of change in one swift cycle ran
Till now. Alas, the soul!—how soon must she
Accept her primal immortality,—
The flesh resume its dust whence it began?

O Lord of work and peace! O Lord of life!
O Lord, the awful Lord of will! though late,
Even yet renew this soul with duteous breath:
That when the peace is garnered in from strife,
The work retrieved, the will regenerate,
This soul may see thy face, O Lord of death!",Dante Gabriel Rossetti,1983,"[94, 78, 70, 26, 25, 25, 25, 26, 29, 32, 36]",11

I could never even try

You see the traces--they always show

And they gon' know who you are (And they gon' know who you are)

[Verse 1:]
Listen up boys and girls once upon a time
Lived a Chinese kid they told him he couldn't rhyme
There was only one thing that was steady on his mind
That's to try and get signed so he got heavy on his grind
Sharpened up his skills machete'd every line
Put 110% into it everytime
Made it to the finals but never obtained a ring
If he could go back he wouldn't change a thing
Seen the ups and downs not nervous don't regret it
Cause when you're flying high turbulence is expected
Why continue? only he knows the real reason
10 years in the game and guess what he's still breathin'
You may think otherwise some say he's a success
Either way he just knows overall that he's been blessed
Who's the Chinese kid you already might have guessed
They say you live and you learn time to put it to the test

[Hook X3:]

[Verse 2:]
I know you got dreams that you been chasing for a long time
You been waiting but it starts to feel like such a long line
Before you know it it becomes a love hate relationship
Only just a few things that you can be so patient with ""
I can relate to it all I gotta say is have faith with it
Before homeplate you gotta hit first base with it
An opportunity is only what you make of it
Your birthday only comes once a year so have your cake with it
Other than that don't try to steal an extra slice
It ain't a million bucks but I offer you this advice
Don't ever take a handout why would you when you can stand out
If you can t build a sand castle start with a sand house
Work your way up from the bottom to the top
You'll never get there only if you stop
All I'm tryin to do now is give them
Somethin' they can feel

Ya know, you give a man a reason for living
Not to mention, you take my paycheck

Ya know cuz the things that I feel so proud about
The things that you do
Ya know, like runnin' my car into telephone poles
But I still love you baby, I didn't get mad did I?

To be in such a hurry
It made me feel grand, yes it did
Uuh I need you, I just need you

[Verse 1]
Uh
You know I was your bread, your butter
And I ain't talkin bout that bread I fucked up on you
Cause in my head man I swore I lucked up
Wasn't countin all the butter I spreaded on you
So true now, why would I play you bitch I made you
I'm not talkin bout the things that I gave you
Clothes wit the labels, I brought you round Hov and the label
Spring water while holdin you're age koo
Naw I ain't tryin to degrade you
But you was a lost little girl n you're world boo I saved you
Ya pop owe me a favor, I basically raised you
From squada to Bentley-whippin

Huh, shoulda seen the Ginger in you
Tried to off Beans like Rothstein? Go figure
Youu take my dough, spend wit the next nigga you crazy bitch?

And dis was the one I trusted
Who would ever think she would spread like mustard

With a certain love that you know will stand
It takes a good woman and a good man, I believe

I believe, I believe enough don't I
I believe when I see her eyes
I believe there is too much love to hide

Boy don't stand there in the shadows
Let her know you care about what she knows
Turn your mind into a window
And the listener will lead who follows, I believe

I believe, I believe enough don't I
I believe when I see her eyes
I believe there is too much love to hide

If you don't trust at all you lose
You are bound to fall
Lost behind your wall

I believe, I believe enough don't I
I believe when I see her eyes
I believe there is too much love to hide
Too much, too much

So you know now you found out
This is the kind of love you can shout about
Leave your loneliness in the past
This is the kind of love that's gonna last, I believe

We've got to have some music on the new frontier

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fagen]
Let's pretend that it's the real thing
And stay together all night long
And when I really get to know you
We'll open up the doors and climb into the dawn
Confess your passion your secret fear
Prepare to meet the challenge of the new frontier",Donald Fagen,1983,"[94, 86, 70, 72, 78, 86]",6
465,Little Thing Called Love,"[Verse 1]
See somebody
Walking down the street
Hanging head
And a-shuffling feet
Don't take much to see
What they've been thinking of
What makes you hypnotized?
What puts a tear in your eye?
What makes you have to choose?
What brings you the blues?
A little thing called love [x2]

[Chorus]
Only love puts a tear in your eye
Only love makes you hypnotized
Only love makes you choose
Only love brings you the blues

[Verse 2]
Wait a minute now, honey
Don't be sad
This may be the best love you ever had
That don't mean that you had enough

Тут Соня Мармеладова, а вот тебе бы надо бы
Пару ингаляторов, удар дефибриллятора
Чтобы зачитать, как я, звезда амфитеатра
Ведь Соня на битах, как сеанс у педиатра
А дети все кричат: ""О Соня!""
Мышке твой хуй больно в кишках колется
Весь кишлак гомик, я как КиШ - на троне
Ты летишь, как Коби. Разряжаю весь патронник
Ра-та-та ты под землёй, как кобальт
Разрываюсь на битах, словно здесь Чернобыль
Школьница Дэма
Отряд камикадзе — тут школьница эмо
К-К-КОМБО как Кимбо Слайс,
Тут MGK, Соня - киборг Сайракс
Ты Майли Сайрус, я Savage-Savage
Двойная рифма - Double Damage
Я Дамблдор, ты тут долдон
Забываешь свой текст, как купить гандон
Жирный flow, Ким Дотком
Илюха поц норм, но он ебанько
Читает свой рэп с таким ебалом
Словно занят прямо щас тройным аналом
Двойным аналом, у всех изъяны, бро
У твоего грайма лицо Марьяны Ро
Это как так? Ты мудак, тик-так время утекло
Ты не вагван, ты не ванван
Твой Декамерон - плак-плак на битах
Илюха поц норм, но он ебанько

Не успел попасть в бит, пиф-паф по пятам
Эй, да у нас тут дырка
Мини Маус - МС Подстилка
В тебе грайма нет, слушай Меззу
Твой флоу — Рогатка, давалка с Версус
Флоу — шлюшка. Гулял с другими
Флоу — пушка. Слова, как гири
Чейни, помнишь на финале тебя знатно слили?
Ты хотел мне отплатить? Сука, скинь на Qiwi
Просто мусор, просто клининг
После тусы топить под lean'ом
Последний чирик, свое горе пятаки
Воскрешаю русский grime, будто Соня клирик
Я зомби-критик. Под зомби Риддим
Качусь в темноте мимо зон бикини
Но меня не проведешь, как Иисуса на мякине
Пусть твоё очко не клумба, но мы всё же засадили туда
Семя антихайпа
Я сожру тебя с говном со всеми котяхами
Ты боишься насекомых, ебанный гук
Тебя собьет мой Volkswagen Жук
Какие панчи?
Какие люди, такие панчи
Эти 2 подружки, сестрички Олсен
И отсосут сестрички awesome
Сестрички awesome
И отсосут сестрички awesome (Ах)

Тебе дали хайпа, чуть больше бабла
И ты отрекся от того что раньше сказал
""Я лучше сдохну ебанным ноунеймом
Чем прославлюсь и стану тобой""
Вот это жопа, прям как у J. Lo
Можешь убить себя прям перед толпой
Ой, что передумал?
Где же совесть ты нашел Яндекс или Google
Скрывался, ставил на mute трубку
Ты продал имя, как свою куртку
Твой слушатель дети 12 лет
Ты певец малолеток и это твой удел
Посасывать хуец за монету тут пиздец
Опонненту, как членом бы ты не дудел
Штамповка! Где прежний запал и дух интеллекта
Андрюха сказал - Слава в миг исполнил, потому как Андрюха директор
Это хайп машина по продаже мерча и походу она грузовая
Нахуй качество, писать на количество легче, похоже на игру Замая
Слушатель, ты не поверишь глазам
Все его заслуги - это zero
Всю твою известность сделал ты сам?
Всю твои известность сделал Мирон
Куплеты тоска
Ведь это говно или подснежник
Да бля!

[Verse]
Как наступить на это борзое ебало
Чтобы порция навоза нам на кросы не попала
Батл, не выходим босыми - мы два сапога пара
Кто-то не выходит Боссом из того самого бара

Парень, на их поле боя ты – воин не великий
Без пробы свежей крови – не ровня для элит
Хмурил брови на них, а они бровью не повели
И все от мала до велика тебя продинамили

И тут бам – без разбора
Будут на органы все из вас порваны
Здесь царь бомба, есть в нас порох
Сделать раздолбанным весь танцол
Ведь здесь сто сорок, а его пульс иной
Переплюнул тебя, убери соплю, не ной
Как морозить хуйню, так ты в плюсе, но
На этом минусе ты абсолютный ноль

Вам шах и мат, всего в один ход
Ты падший примат, а не злобный Кинг Конг
Динозавр, а залы с тех пор не битком
Твой рэп – это сайт испортил бит.ком

Ком этот встанет в горле белком
Его я заставлю ссать кипятком
Я бы на месте Мирона вас слал далеко
Вы не антихайп - вы Слава и Ко

Слишком жестко, воу
Ты мне на батле не товарищ, а тамбовский волк
Это повесть Крылова – лаять брось, хуйло
Ведь у меня глаза, как у Слона, на Моську, лох

До вызова Мирона вас врозь вело
Замай притянутый за уши - в твой силок
Ты его бросил в лодку, но с его скиллом
Это говно не улов - оно само всплыло

Или как Бог над водой –
Иконой для потомков Тупака, Кападонны
В рэпе ты дедок, типа тебе так удобно?
А рвать на биток так – нихуя подобного

Вдох – снова под воду. И потом
Если вы, гондоны, тупо из-за опыта готовы
Называть воды потоком этот топовый потоп
То у кого-то много опыта тут только допотопного


Пробил как дно эхолот
Это мой прорыв года через твой потолок
Ты в ступе годы, а не воду толок
В говно по локоть - ты не воин болот

Замая мы просто ебали в дёсна
У тебя Антихайп головного мозга
Слава не забыл свои корни просто
У него Антихайп головного мозга

Я бы мог это доказывать, но
Мне без мазы из пальца высасывать гной
Одной твоей фразой пересказанной мной
Я за раз смою 2 заразы в одной

Суй в анус весь fame, Слава
Пиздуй нахуй звездой батлов
Долбись в сраку, я останусь
Ведь сверху, падла, больнее падать

Бит не замечаешь вовсе
Но бомбит, когда пролетаешь мимо орбит

Тысячи, тысячи, не совершенных грехов, еще
Тонны бумаги, тыщи, не марами дворов, трущоб
Килограммы на форматы, класть еще плотью тюки
Ведь я в лучах звездной болезни, как Склодовская-Кюри

И подохну когда придавит плитой ядерный гриф
Но позже чем, дядька Сэм тебя Микки Маус раскабалит
Ты как в цирке на туловище маска и парик
А я по жизне ебанутый, Дай мне 9 грамм, Айболит

Из чрева вылезает новый парадокс герой
Опустели кинозалы, просмотровое окно
Горит одно лишь, будто пуканы, всех этих прото звезд

Одену его туз, как футляр (р-р!)

Кого порвать? На каких битосах? Ты что Кобейн?
Любишь 2 ствола во рту. Порнохабу ты сказал: ""god damn""
Видя, как сосут эти малышки на битах
Ваша крыша уже едет, словно Чейни cadillac

Тучно, белая корова. Назовитесь ""Як-як-як""
Но я прожарю это мясо, словно в передаче ""Смак""

[Verse]
Я живу не чтобы фан меня любил и целовал
Мое имя на могиле набивает цену вам
Или двигаться по фану из вагины в целлофан
На свет в конце туннеля, чтобы кинуться на фары

Будто пес, что бежит под колеса машины
Пока я жив ты просто скажи мне, что
Разменять мой возраст ошибок
На вшивую жизнь, этих полных фальшивок?

Нахуй вам жить на полусогнутых
Если на них не доходили до высот вы
Если вы, до выноса команды Зондер
Вскрылись и выдохлись, как банки содовой

Щека Бога, твоя щека
Я вещаю из убогого ящика, в будущем
Но 4 года маячив тут
Ставил крест на своем настоящем

А вы таращиться будете, да
На нем суммы просмотров без букв и дат
Но мне лететь на удар, в темноту не беда
Мне ничто осветит этот путь в никуда

Камикадзе все ближе к земле
И вселенная дышит этим выбросом лет
Один вдох, все выжать в себе
В забеге к себе, ведь ты же сильнее

Батл-рэп мне как, Мекка она теперь
Меня доведет от фаната до фанатика
Если эту секту придать, то анафеме
На волоске висят, как на канате

Проклинать его, он тянет вниз
А время альпинист, вниз это немыслимо
Снова чистый лист, но хуже для Дениса
Это рвать на битах душу атеиста

[Hook]
Пока мы летаем там, где Икар не летал
Вы стоите на своем, как Земля на китах
Мне на плечи давит дар, я как планку Титан

Работал долго, ведь был никем
Выборг не Лондон, а Бирмингем
Я все вам отдал, чтобы быть свободным
Тут безысходность под BPM

Мы делали батлы по фану
До того, как это стало мейнстримом
Всем было поебать на рекламу
Если в кругу, то стадо не стимул

Путь от Альфа бара, до финала в А2
Будто полный зал или ебаный подвал
Я прошел не за день, не надо бабла
И мой flow теперь тебе достанет до гланд

#SLOVOSPB
И это значит то что я уже весь в игре
Не замечал ухмылок в спину и спесь гиен
Мы им брезгуем, время отсекало лишних, как лезвием

Я проклят
И в этом вся моя карма
Мой город Gotham, мой мир DC
А не счастливый и красочный Marvel

Скажи мне сука хоть что-то
То, что я и так не знал о себе
Меня не любили паблики ваши элитные
Зато самоотдача стала сильнее

И ярость огней я не замечал
Меня не остановить дернув за рычаг
И кажется мне я прожигал каждый свой день
Как до записи летела неделя за час

И я рву на битах, ведь другого выхода нет
Первые струны (что выдавали аккомпанемент)
Нас копировали всех под один трафарет
Ведь мы #SLOVOSPB и нас хранит Бафомет

So what I'm really tryna say is
And what I hope you understand
Is despite of all the imperfections of who I am
I still wanna be your man
I know it hasn't been easy for us to talk
With everyone being around but
It's just personal, this just, for me and you
And I want you to know that I still love you
And though the seasons may change
Sometimes love goes from sunshine to rain
I'm under this umbrella and I'm calling your name

And you know I don't wanna lose that, cause I still believe

[Verse 3]
I still believe in love, I still believe in us
I hope you believe in us, the way I believe in us, you don't see
Cause what you don't see is when we don't speak I really don't sleep, I wanna talk to you
And if I'd have the world in my hands I'd give it all to ya
I wanna know if you feeling, the way that I'm feeling
I wanna know if you feeling, the way that I'm, the way that I'm

You taught me to be careful with your heart, your heart, with your heart",Justin Bieber,1983,"[100, 93, 87, 77, 44, 26, 10, 10, 11, 12]",10

471,After I Cry Tonight,"[Thoughts from MauSe]

[Hook]
If tonight is my last night, please don't cry
Just remember the good times of my life

[Verse 1]
Listen to the maestro, maestro
MauSe is a pyro
Sellebrate life yo, Psycho for a night show
Mudd club, paradise
Give me a drink and a pair of dice
And a hot girl that'll rock my world
Before I go to the after life
I ain't there yet
Don't care if I gotta year left
Just care if there's more beer left
That I can take to the head like a hair net
I been everywhere on a leer jet
I just need a girl I can stare at
Put my hands at, where her rear at
You hear that? I don't fear death
I scare death, so let's dance!

[Hook]
If tonight is my last night, please don't cry
Just remember the good times of my life
""Remember my life, my life, remember my life.""
I'm gonna Sellebrate, Sellebrate
Whoaaa ooo ohhhh
Sellebrate!
Sellebrate, Sellebrate
Whoaaa ooo ohhhh
Sellebrate!

[Verse 2]
The night just started for me
Someone's daughters on me
Gave me a magic marker and asked can you start drawing on me?
Low life's in the spot
With Decepticons, no Auto-bots
Time to pose for a photo-op
Say cheese, this just what I need
My scene, this just what I mean
I'm free its just what I see
Living life, no regrets
But If I could turn no to yes
And turn water to wine, turn broke to checks
Turn over my soul, eternal rest
Wait my turn, no rush for me
I'm right where I want to be
Where you at though?

[Hook]
If tonight is my last night, please don't cry
""Enjoy the night, tonight, Enjoy the night, tonight.""
Just remember the good times of my life
""Remember my life, my life, remember my life.""
I'm gonna Sellebrate, Sellebrate
Whoaaa ooo ohhhh
Sellebrate
Sellebrate, Sellebrate
Whoaaa ooo ohhhh
Sellebrate!

[Verse 3]
Who wants to be mine tonight?
I'm tryna ride tonight
You know I can't drive tonight
I had too much wine tonight
That don't mean ima die tonight
But if I do, don't cry tonight
Remember me, everyday
After I die, Sellebrate!

[Bridge]
Its ok, its alright
Tonight is the night
Don't worry about tomorrow
We may never see a tomorrow
Let's dance till we see the sunshine!

472,Love In Store,"[Verse 1]
All I know is the way that I feel
Whenever you're around
You've got a way of lifting me up
Instead of bringing me down (instead of bringing me down)

[Chorus 1]
I can't fight it anymore
Since you've been around
We've got love in store

[Verse 2]
You're the only one I ever felt
Could be special to me
You look at me and I just melt
I'm scared of feeling that way

473,What You're Missing,"[Intro x3]
Ooh eeh ooh

[Verse 1]
We're so beautiful and so broken
I think the cover is about to crack open
I watched you through the window at the Abbey
Looking like you're in a video
But when your so-called friends turn away
The shadow crosses over your face
For a minute I know just what you're thinking
You might have it all, but you're short of one thing

[Chorus]
Living in a plastic world
You think you're such a lucky girl
You got your diamonds and your pearls
But I'm what you're missing, I'm what you're missing
I could be all that you need
To feel like you are finally free
From a life that leaves your soul empty
I'm what you're missing, I'm what you're missing, girl
Ooh eeh ooh

[Verse 2]
All the posers that hover around you
Dropping names and cash like the who's who
Bet they all think they're Hollywood and high class
Bet their numbers all wind up in the trash
And though you seem so hard to get to
I know all the secret places I can find you
I like that you like to slumming on the dark side
Well I could keep you entertained for awhile

[Chorus]
Living in a plastic world
You think you're such a lucky girl
You got your diamonds and your pearls
But I'm what you're missing, I'm what you're missing
I could be all that you need
To feel like you are finally free
From a life that leaves your soul empty
I'm what you're missing, I'm what you're missing, girl

[Bridge]
And girl, when there's nobody else around
I'll make it okay to come down
Take off your Converse and your crown
Cause' you've been wandering, I've been waiting
And I'm what's missing
Ooh eeh ooh
Ooh eeh ooh
Ooh eeh ooh

[Chorus]
Living in a plastic world
You think you're such a lucky girl

475,All Those Lies,"History repeats itself
It all comes back again
Leaders and preachers
Believers and deceivers
Fanatically leading, Blindly following
Apparently prayers make no sense
Maybe they are not (so) intense
The bigger the power
The more is madness
Fanatically leading, Blindly following

Chorus:
And they still tell us all those lies
And they don't care that someone dies
Will the world end up in devastation?
All we can do is pray

Religious hate seals someone's fate
Heaven is promised for suicide
Does not matter who also died
It seems that all the angels have disappeared
We are left on our own
Its seems that purgatory is coming near
Do we believe in a God?
Is there a sense for us to live if we destroy?
Seems like nothing remains
Fanatically leading, Blindly following

Chorus x2

They will prepare for another holy war
They will prepare for nuclear attacks
They will prepare for judgment day to come
They will prepare for the end of all our days

Still they tell lies
Don't care that someone dies
The world ends up in devastation
Still they tell lies
Don't care that someone dies
Or do we hope and pray for salvation?
Lies... they tell us lies
Lies... they tell us lies",Dawn Of Destiny,1983,"[99, 90, 88, 64, 41, 41, 41, 47, 49]",9

It takes a lot to love you
(All I'm doing)
You know it's true

There's one thing

The look of love

(Who's got the look?)
I don't know the answer to that question
(Where's the look?)
If I knew I would tell you

They say, ""Martin, maybe one day you'll find true love""
I say, ""Maybe there must be a solution
To the one thing, the one thing we can't find""

I heard you got a new man, I see you takin' a pic
Then you post it up, thinkin' that it's makin' me sick (brr brr)
I see you callin', I be makin' it quick
I'ma answer that shit like, ""I don't fuck with you.""
Bitch, I got no feelings to go
I swear I had it up to here, I got no ceilings to go
I mean, for real, fuck how you feel
Fuck your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill
Yeah, and every day I wake up celebratin' shit
Why? ‘Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy bitch
I stuck to my guns, that's what made me rich
That's what put me on, that's what got me here
That's what made me this
And everything that I do is my first name (B-I-G)
These hoes chase bread, aw damn, she got a bird brain
Ain't nothin' but trill in me, aw man, silly me
I just bought a crib, three stories; that bitch a trilogy
And you know I'm rollin' weed that's fuckin' up the ozone
I got a bitch that text me she ain't got no clothes on
And then another one text, then your ass next
And I'ma text your ass back, like…

[Verse 2: E-40]
Got a million things on my mind, executive deals online
Limited amount of time, chasin' these dollar signs
And you ain't on your grind
You liable to find me up in the MGM casino in the D
Fuckin' off fetti I could've put on property
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten
My niggas put murder missions
She choosin', that's her decision, free my niggas in prison
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich
Got a blunt in my dental, blowin' hemp in a rental
On my way to Sacramento, late night; Arsenio
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless
Barely Harley, I'm chromeless, you might end up domeless
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I'll make a bitch stand outside forever, like the Statue of Liberty
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South
I raise my styrofoam up, and pour some drink in my mouth
Why you always coming around with bad news?
Say you want me to win, but hope I lose
Askin' if I rock with other niggas in the crew
But them niggas cool, it's just that…

I got a new chick that I gotta thank God for
I got a new whip that I gotta thank the lot for
Yeah, I got a lot but want a lot more
Yeah, we in the buildin', but I'm tryna take it to the top floor
I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up
It seem like nowadays everybody breakin' up
That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til you're unconscious
Feel me when you get a fine bitch
Just don't forget to read the fine print
Life got me meditatin' like I'm in the Himalayas
Keep it G with the L lit on me like the elevator
Yeah, I know that karma's too real
So I hope you doin' cool, but still…

[Outro: Big Sean]
Stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
Little stupid ass… I ain't fuckin with…
I ain't fuckin'… I ain't, I ain't fuckin' with you

481,Memory,"Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone
In the lamplight, the withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days
I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every streetlamp seems to beat
A fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon
It will be morning

Daylight
I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in
When the dawn comes, tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smokey days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

[Optional verse:]
Sunlight through the trees in summer
Endless masquerading
Like a flower, as the day is breaking
The memory is fading

Touch me
It's so easy to leave me
All alone with my memory
Of my days in the sun
If you touch me, you'll understand what happiness is
Look, a new day has begun",Andrew Lloyd Webber,1983,"[96, 96, 90, 60, 39, 39, 42, 45]",8

Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters

In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, ""What?"" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out and goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 4: Eminem]
There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow, fuck no
Go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all

489,Two Less Lonely People In The World,"I was down, my dreams were wearing thin
When you're lost, where do you begin?
My heart always seemed to drift from day to day
Looking for the love that never came my way

Then you smiled and I reached out to you
I could tell you were lonely too
One look and then it all began for you and me
The moment that we touched I knew that there would be

Two less lonely people in the world
And it's gonna be fine
Out of all the people in the world
I just can't believe you're mine
In my life where everything was wrong
Something finally went right
Now there's two less lonely people
In the world tonight

Just to think what I might have missed
Looking back how did I exist
I dreamed, still I never thought I'd come this far
But miracles come true, I know 'cause here we are

Two less lonely people in the world
And it's gonna be fine
Out of all the people in the world
I just can't believe you're mine
In my life where everything was wrong
Something finally went right
Now there's two less lonely people
In the world tonight

Tonight I fell in love with you
And all the things I never knew
Seemed to come to me somehow
'Cause, baby, love is here and now there's

497,Does It Make You Remember,"I've heard talk goin' round about you
They say you've taken up with somebody new
And they say you're still crazy
But I'm still crazy about you
And you do remember

The heart abused of the heart unused

I know what I'd chose
So why did you run to her
Is she just an excuse

To help you remember
Make you forget
Does it just bring a tear to your eye
With the pain and the pleasure
Do you ever regret
When you see how love passed you by
Does it make you remember
Does it make you remember

I saw your car from my window last night
You were drivin' real slow
And I hid from your lights
Was it bringing you back
I was hopin' it might

Make you remember
Make you forget
Does it just bring a tear to your eye
With the pain and the pleasure
Do you ever regret
When you see how love passed you by

I've heard talk goin' round about you
They say you've taken up with somebody new

I hope that he's doing fine

501,Industrial Disease,"[Verse 1]
Warning lights are flashing down at Quality Control
Somebody threw a spanner and they threw him in the hole
There's rumors in the loading bay and anger in the town
Somebody blew the whistle and the walls came down
There's a meeting in the boardroom they're trying to trace the smell
There's leaking in the washroom there's a sneak in personnel
Somewhere in the corridors someone was heard to sneeze
Goodness me, could this be industrial disease?
The caretaker was crucified for sleeping at his post
They're refusing to be pacified it's him they blame the most
The watchdog's got rabies the foreman's got fleas
And everyone's concerned about industrial disease

[Verse 2]
There's panic on the switchboard tongues are ties in knots
Some come out in sympathy some come out in spots
Some blame the management some the employees
And everybody knows it's the industrial disease
Yeah, now the work force is disgusted downs tools and walks
Innocence is injured experience just talks
Everyone seeks damages and everyone agrees
That these are 'classic symptoms of a monetary squeeze'
On ITV and BBC they talk about the curse
Philosophy is useless theology is worse
History boils over there's an economics freeze
Sociologists invent words that mean 'industrial disease'

[Verse 3]
Doctor Parkinson declared ""I'm not surprised to see you here
You've got smoker's cough from smoking, brewer's droop from drinking beer
I don't know how you came to get the Betty Davis' knees
But worst of all young man you've got industrial disease""
He wrote me a prescription he said ""You are depressed
But I'm glad you came to see me to get this off your chest
Come back and see me later - next patient please
Send in another victim of industrial disease""

[Verse 4]
And I go down to Speaker's Corner I'm thunderstruck
They got free speech, tourists, police in trucks
Two men say they're Jesus one of them must be wrong
There's a protest singer, He's singing a protest song - he says
They want to have a war to keep their factories
They want to have a war to keep us on our knees
They want to have a war to stop us buying Japanese
They want to have a war to stop Industrial Disease
They're pointing out the enemy to keep you deaf and blind
They want to sap your energy incarcerate your mind
Give you Rule Brittania, gassy beer, page three
Two weeks in Espana and Sunday striptease'
Meanwhile the first Jesus says ""I'd cure it soon
Abolish Monday mornings and Friday afternoons""
The other one's on a hunger strike he's dying by degrees

507,Muscles,"Muscles

Injuries to the brain, spinal cord or nerves can affect muscle control. When nerves lose control of muscles, it is called paralysis. When a muscle is injured, a nearby muscle often takes over for the injured one.

Bones

Bones weaken with age. Older adults have more brittle bones. Sometimes they break surprisingly easily. This gradual weakening of bones is called osteoporosis.

Joints

All joints have a normal range of movement in which they can move freely, without too much stress or strain. When joints are forced beyond this range, ligaments stretch and tear.

TYPES OF INJURIES

The four basic types of injuries:

- Fractures
- Dislocations
- Sprains
- Strains

What to Look For

Always suspect a severe injury when any of the following signals are present:

- There is pain. One of the most common signals in any muscle, bone or joint injury is pain. The injured area may be very painful to touch and move.
- There is signiﬁ cant bruising and swelling. The area may be swollen and red or bruised.
- There is signiﬁ cant deformity. The area may be twisted or strangely bent. It may have abnormal lumps, ridges and hollows.
- The person is unable to use the affected part normally.
- There are bone fragments sticking out of a wound.
- The person feels bones grating or the person felt or heard a snap or pop at the time of injury.
- The injured area is cold, numb and tingly.
- The cause of the injury suggests that it may be severe.

When to Call 9-1-1

- There is obvious deformity
- There is moderate or severe swelling and discoloration.
- Bones sound or feel like they are rubbing together.
- A snap or pop was heard or felt at the time of the injury.
- There is a fracture with an open wound at, or bone piercing through, the injury site.
- The injured person cannot move or use the affected part normally.
- The injured area is cold and numb.
- The injury involves the head, neck or spine.
- The injured person has trouble breathing.
- The cause of the injury suggests that the injury may be severe.
- It is not possible to safely or comfortably move the person to a vehicle for transport to a hospital.

What to Do Until Help Arrives

General care for injuries to muscles, bone and joints includes following the mnemonic RICE:

- Rest: Do not move or straighten the injured area.
- Immobilize: Stabilize the injured area in the position it was found. Splint the injured part only if the person must be moved or transported to receive medical care and it does not cause more pain. Minimizing movement can prevent further injury.
- Cold: Fill a plastic bag with ice and water or wrap ice with a damp cloth and apply ice to the injured area for periods of about 20 minutes. Place a thin barrier between the ice and bare skin. If 20-minute icing cannot be tolerated, apply ice for periods of 10 minutes. If continued icing is needed, remove the pack for 20 minutes, and then replace it. Cold reduces internal bleeding, pain and swelling. Do not apply heat as there is no evidence that applying heat helps muscle, bone or joint injuries.
- Elevate: Elevate the injured part only if it does not cause more pain. Elevating the injured part may help reduce swelling.

Splinting an Injury

Anatomic splints.
- The person’s body is the splint. For example, you can splint an arm to the chest or an injured leg to the uninjured leg (Fig. 8-10).
Soft splints.
- Soft materials, such as a folded blanket, towel, pillow or folded triangular bandage, can beused for the splint (Fig. 8-11). A sling is a speciﬁc kind of soft splint that uses a triangular bandage tied to support an injured arm, wrist or hand.
Rigid splints.
- Padded boards, folded magazines or newspapers, or padded metal strips that do not have any sharp edges can serve as splints (Fig. 8-12).
The ground.
- An injured leg stretched out on the ground is supported by the ground.

Head, Neck and Spinal Injuries

Injuries to the head, neck or spine can cause paralysis, speech or memory problems or other disabling conditions. These injuries can damage bone and soft tissue, including the brain and spinal cord.

An injury to the brain can cause bleeding inside the skull.

The spine is a strong, ﬂexible column of small bones that support the head and trunk. Injuries to the spine can fracture vertebrae and tear ligaments. In some cases, the vertebrae can shift and cut or squeeze the spinal cord. This can paralyze the person or be life threatening.

What to Look For

You also should suspect a head, neck or spinal injury if the injured person:

- Was involved in a motor vehicle crash or subjected to another signiﬁcant force.
- Was injured as a result of a fall from greater than a standing height.
- Is wearing a safety helmet that is broken.
- Complains of neck or back pain.
- Has tingling or weakness in the extremities.
- Is not fully alert.
- Appears to be intoxicated.
- Appears to be frail or older than 65 years.
- Is a child younger than 3 years with evidence of a head or neck injury.

What to Do Until Help Arrives

While you are waiting for emergency medical services (EMS) personnel to arrive, the best care you can give is to minimize movement of the person’s head, neck and spine. As long as the person is breathing normally, support the head and neck in the position found. Do this by placing your hands on both sides of the person’s head in the position in which you found it. Support the person’s head in that position until EMS personnel take over supporting the person’s head. If the head is sharply turned to one side, do not move it. Support the head and neck in the position found.

The person may become confused, drowsy or unconscious. Breathing may stop. The person may be bleeding. If the person is unconscious, keep the airway open and check breathing.

Concussions

What to Look For

- Confusion, which may last from moments to several minutes.
- Headache.
- Repeated questioning about what happened.
- Temporary memory loss, especially for periods immediately before and after the injury.
- Brief loss of consciousness.
- Nausea and vomiting.
- Speech problems (patient is unable to answer questions or obey simple commands).
- Blurred vision or light sensitivity.

What to Do Until Help Arrives

- Support the head and neck in the position in which you found it.
- Maintain an open airway.
- Control any bleeding and apply dressings to any open wounds.
- Do not apply direct pressure if there are any signs of an obvious skull fracture.
- If there is clear ﬂ uid leaking from the ears or a wound in the scalp, cover the area loosely with a sterile gauze dressing.
- Monitor the person for any changes in condition.
- Try to calm and reassure the person. Encourage the person to talk with you; it may prevent loss of consciousness.

Chest Injuries

What to Do Until Help Arrives

What to Look For

If the injury is serious, the person will have trouble breathing.

Pelvic Injuries

- Severe pain.
- Bruising.
- Possible external bleeding.
- Nausea.
- Vomiting (which may include blood).
- Weakness.
- Thirst.
- Tenderness or a tight feeling in the abdomen.
- Possible loss of sensation in the legs or inability to move the legs.

Be alert for the signals of shock, which could indicate internal bleeding and/or blood loss.

Young love, love, uh-huh, yeah, a teenage love
Young love, young love, everything I need, I got in my young love
A teenage love, young love, young love, girl, a teenage love

[Verse 1]
Tell me what's the definition of love?
It seems like everybody thinks they done figured it out but
Every time they fall up in it, they fall out, in and out it again
Tell me how they gonna know about us
Telling me and you that we ain't even been around long enough
We can prove 'em wrong, show 'em how it's done
I know that we can do it

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause if it's wilding out, we got that, and forgiving, we got that
If it's talking 'bout how we feeling, we got that
If it's hanging out, keeping it real then we got that
Me and you know what the deal is but

[Chorus]
Since we ain't 21 (Oh)
They be tryna say it ain't love (A teenage love)
'Cause we can't hit the clubs
They be tryna say we're too young (A teenage love)
I ain't saying that we're tryna be grown
I'm just saying that we're old enough to know
We got that young love, young love
We lucky 'cause we got that young love

[Verse 2]
It's crazy how all our friends say
That we gone, they still tryna figure us out, babe

Talk behind your back (And), smile up in your face
Oh girl, we can prove 'em wrong and show 'em how it's done
And girl, I know that we can do it just because

If it's talking 'bout how we're feeling, we got that
Just hanging out, keep it real then we got that

To resist your charm

And uh, I started out dumb, sprung off a hood-rats
Listenin' to the radio, wishin' that I could rap
But nothing changed, I was stuck in the game
'Cause everybody in the industry was fuckin' me, mayne
Listen, I got a scheme, break away, do my own thang
Drop some conversation, sit back and let the phone ring
Niggas ain't wanna see me rise
97 watch me cut these motherfuckers down to size
And if I catch another case, Lord knows how they hate me
Got a player in the court room, please don't let 'em frame me
I've been dealt a lot of bad cards livin' as a thug
Count my blessings and throw my stressings in this land with no love
Maybe they seen me rollin', look at all this green I'm holdin'
I get this why they envious and get they eyes swollen
Hopin' the heavenly father love a hustler
Meet the hardest nigga on the Earth to ever bust a nut
My homies tell me, ""Have a heart"" — fuck they feelings
I've been tryin' to make a million since we started, we cold hearted
Niggas in masks that'll blast at the task force
Empty out my clip, time to mash, they asked for it
Me, Makaveli, I'm a motherfucker
We break bread, now we thug brothers, haha

A war? They ain't ready for it haha

Yeah, nigga beware, stand clear
This nigga's scared, man, I don't really care
I've been lost love, my heart need a hug
My bite need blood, I fight with a grudge
The life of a thug nigga might need gloves
But you'll never know with a price on your mug
Them fight strips snug right around your hands
Makin' sure you can never grab the mic again

Smokin' on the finest dope, ay-ay-ay-ah
Drank until I can't no mo', ay-ay-ay-ah
Really I'm a sober soul
But I'm with the homies right now
And we ain't askin' for no favors
Rush a nigga quick, then laugh about it later, ay-ay-ay-ah

[Part II]

[Verse 1]
Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol and orange soda
Janky stash box when the federales'll roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
I hope the universe love you today
'Cause the energy we bringin' sure to carry away
A flock of positive activists that fill they body with hate
If it's necessary; bumpin' Jeezy first album, lookin' distracted
Speakin' language only we know, you think it's an accent
The windows roll down, all I see is a hand pass it
Hotboxin' like George Foreman grillin' the masses
Of the workin' world; we pulled up on a bunch of workin' girls
And asked them what they workin' with
Look at me, I got the blunt in my mouth
Usually I'm drug-free, but, shit, I'm with the homies

[Hook 1]
Yeah, nigga, we off a pill and Remy Red
Come through and bust ya head, nigga!
Me and the homies
Sag all the way to the liquor store
Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more
Me and the homies
I ride for my mothafuckin' niggas
Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in
Me and the homies
Matter of fact, I hop out that mothafucka
And be like ""doo-doo-doo-doot, doo-doo-doo-doo-doot!”

[Verse 2]
It's 2:30 and the sun is beamin'
Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screamin'
Hungry for anything unhealthy
And if nutrition can help me
I'll tell you to suck my dick, then I'll continue eatin'
We speedin' on the 405, passin' Westchester
You know, the light-skinned girls in all the little dresses
Good Lord, they knew we weren't from 'round there
'Cause every time we down there
We pullin' out the Boost Mobile SIM cards
Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination
Before we sparked a conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didn't like
Then started interrogatin'
I never was a gangbanger, I mean
I never was stranger to the fonk neither, I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
That's ironic, 'cause I've never been violent
Until I'm with the homies

[Hook 2]

Me and the homies
(Bullshittin', actin' a fool)
Me and the homies
(Trippin', really trippin')
Me and the homies
(Just ridin', just ridin', just ridin')

[Verse 3]
Braggin' 'bout the episode we just had
A shot of Hennessy didn't make me feel that bad
I'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt ya
We tryna conquer the city with disobedience
Quick to turn it up, even if we ain't got the CD in
But Jeezy still playin'
And our attitude is still ""nigga, what is you sayin'?""
Pull in front of the house
That we been campin' out for like two months
The sun is goin' down as we take whatever we want

Ayy, ayy, nigga, jackpot, nigga, pop the safe!
Ayy, nigga, I think there's somebody in this room!
Wait, what?!
Nigga, there's somebody in this room!

[Verse 4]
I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
DVD's, plasma-screen TV's in the trunk
We made a right, then made a left, then made a right
Then made a left, we was just circlin' life
My mama called: ""Hello? What you doin'?"" — ""Kickin' it.""
I shoulda told her I'm probably 'bout to catch my first offense
With the homies
But – they made a right, then made a left
Then made a right, then another right
One lucky night with the homies

K. Dot, you faded, hood?
Yeah, we finally got that nigga faded
I think he hit the wrong blunt though
Ooh, which one?
Well, which one he talkin' about?
I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it
I pray he ain't hit that
Nah, that nigga straight, he ain't hit that one
Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans!
Nigga, I think we should push back to the city, fo' real doe
Nigga, for what?
What that nigga— what's that Jeezy song say, nigga?
""Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!""
Yeah, yeah, that shit right there
I'm tryna be the nigga in the street
There he go. Man, you don't even know how the shit go
Look, here's the plan, luv
We gon' use the kickback as a alibi, wait 'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission, drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park
'Cause I know he tryna fuck on Sherane tonight
That's what he's not gon' do
Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10:30
That's straight, but we should meet up around 12
I'm tryna fuck on somethin' too
Nigga, sit yo dumb-ass back down!
Nigga, you ain't doin' shit tonight!

You're going to be in trouble
I hope your mama don't look in your room
'Cause if she does
She'll be here soon

Boy, she's gonna be mad
You're a bad boy
And you've got it bad, boy
Boy, say goodbye to your friends
'Cause it's gonna be a while
Til you see them again

Turn on your heartlight

Let it make a happy glow

I promise you, I promise you, yeah (Skepta)
Cross my heart until the day I die

[Verse 1: Skepta]
I've been around the world and back
Screaming more money, more paper
Been doing it major
Even Walkers ain't got this much flavour
They say I'm super bad like McLovin
Now man are calling me family all of a sudden
And I'm like ""Mum, how come you never told me that I had all these cousins?""
This corner I'm standing in, never felt claustrophobic when I came in 10 minutes ago
Now my backs against the wall
It's a good job I'm tall
So I can always see clear
Even with all the smoke in the air
I know some are standing here cause of loving fame
But a lot of them are here out of fear

It's time to go straight back to the top with them
They tried to stop me but I'm doing it again
And all my real friends know I'm a still keep it 10 multiplied by 10
Forgive me if I've been acting a little strange
I never ever knew that one song could make my whole life change
Last week I boarded six planes
But I can't complain, this is the moment I've been waiting for
Picked myself off the floor and now I get a warm welcome when I walked in the door
I'm with Boy Better Know let them all in
But there's a flip side to all things
So before you sign yourself up to the high life
Make sure you read the small print
Please
Listen to me when I'm talking
The guy you're looking at right now is the guy I was this morning
I never had a pen but I made a mark
Even when I top the chart, I'll be the same guy that I was at the start
I hope to die I cross my heart

I keep walking
I keep talking to every cute girl I see
I keep looking
I keep searching for the girl that you used to be
'Cause before all this

[Chorus]
You were lovin' me, hating me, tell me you're my baby
Calling me, telling me, everything that you have just been through

And I'll hold you so tight

526,The Elvis Medley,"Porsche engine in the Chevy
I’m tweaking and it’s heavy
Ramen noodles 🍝 wit lasagna
I done concocted spaghetti
I be on the web like Eddie
Been in her dreams like Freddie
My mission is the game
I get ugly like I’m Betty
I be water hand on flame
Shoot my shot it be all netty

I used to be alright, now I tell em it’s already
Black nylon, patent leather, and my bottoms all reddy
I stay up on my grizzly like my first name was teddy
Baby girl you know I want you, but I’d like to make you beg me
You just beefing, I’m the deli
And your new home is my belly
Serenade her like R.Kelly
Then we head back to the Telli
Please don’t hit me on my celli
Less it’s straight to the g-maily
Got my package wit that jelly
Gave em dilemmas like nelly
They be asking can I see
And I look at em like barely
I was on that Wes like snipes
Cameras shooting it get deadly
And my parents made me odd
I’m the one that’s treated fairly
Get to spraying like its bod
Power circled, no not squarely
Baby asked me if I love her
I say yea but only rarely
On the toilet Elvis Presley
What I’m dropping will stay freshly
Just keep rocking to my medley
Will they stop me, ain’t no telling?
Wit that 4-5 like I’m Larry
Keep some potter like I’m Harry

I kept drumming with that Tom
Then I learned to sing like Gerri
To the game I will stay married
Like a virgin, keep some Mary
I can’t wait to wear no shirt
No tattoos cause I’m too sexy and
I wish I had that girl
Her heart heavy don’t tell Jesse
And I’m sorry, I’m still petty
I’m consistent, kept it steady
I started out wit Jenna
But I’m finna hit up Jenny
We used to pour hypnotic
And then mix it wit that henny
I used to count my pennies
Just to jet off like I’m Benny
A point 5 that’s from Kenny
Men be hating man like many
I boogied with my entry
You a DJ but don’t envy
It’s money it be plenty
Things I can do with a twenty
Every time I pull a scene
They say boy you need a Emmy
The semi, bring the frenzy
Got extendos kept it lengthy
Don’t bop it, no not diddy
It’s still all about the benji’s

Suburban bodied preppie
Colors smelly like I’m peppy
I’d never have to take it
She just give it when I’m dressy
And I prayed my bars on green
And stay heavy locked and levied
Was wit Tyler like I’m Perry
Popped some cristol like I’m cherry
I try not to be heady
But I’m colder than the yeti
Ima give it all I got
Like I’m on my last leggy
You want it come correctly
And I been saying directly
My manner is expressly
I’m too close so please don’t test me
And I bodied this grotesquely
Used to want that Pelli Pelli
Then I learned about power for that feature like I’m Dwele
On contrary for primary brought the flavor strawberry 🍓
I seasoned wit rosemary
Baked the pies I had blueberry
My juice was on cranberry
For detox next January

Raspberry not Raz-B
I got maybach but not Mayberry
Had scrolls on my blackberry
Who was posted on Woodbury
You found me like ancestry
Who was posted on mulberry
I mixed with that grey goose
Then I renamed it gooseberry
Underground like under belly
We was posted like Santelli
Castelli and Gastelli, I was looking for Martelli
Portelli had Vitelli till she cried just like Critelli
They taught me do it deftly
I been Riv since elementary
My jumper stay so wet
I can’t help from feeling densely
If tensely complimentary
We get lit at the dispensary
I swear I go so hard
Till my limbs start feeling trembly
I knew I been on road, used to take trips out to Findlay
I’m done wit all pretending
Been wiser wit my spending
I got Q’s right by the fig tree
Dat knee or dis knee?
I’m sorry for dismissing
Welcome back who had to get me

In 6th grade started kissing
Cause I started reminiscing
Before the snakes was hissing
Had to sneak but not no dissing
If I broke it had some fixing
Know what happens when I’m mixing
To win it like a menace
Off the boards did too much for thinking
I’m childish I’m not kidding
Tis the season here’s my giving
I’m loving and I’m living
I still walk it when I’m sitting
I’m drinking and I’m killing just to post up like a villain
Too choosy I’m just chillin
I’m not picky but I’m pickin
Up like I’m fishing
I got quicker just to get it
Hitting, swimming, kicking, sticking anything can get it
Digging filling spitting wishing shipment would get shipped in
Started swinging vines was hanging
I was avoiding the slipping
I got bluetooth then I chipped in
When I’m done just get to dipping
They was talking bout nobody
Now the shoes just started fittin
Like I got some thing for sale but I am the highest bidder",JaM-Riv,1983,"[92, 71]",2

[Intro: Diddy]
You wanted to fuckin' walk around these roaches. These niggas is roaches. These niggas is mere motherfuckin' mortals. I'm tryna push you to supreme bein'. You don't wanna motherfuckin'... You don't wanna embrace your destiny, you wanna get by
You don't wanna go into the motherfuckin' dark where it's lonely. You can't handle the motherfuckin', the pain of the motherfuckin' not knowin' when the shit is gonna stop

[Hook: French Montana]
Momma's tryna save me but she don't know I'm tryna save her
Man, them niggas tried to play me, man, 'til I got this paper
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
""Blast for me"" – the last words from my nigga
On the pavement, born killers, body shivers
Drug money, dollar figures
Hustlers movin' out of rentals, art of war is mental
Havin' sushi down in Nobu
Strapped like an Afghan soldier, nowhere to go to
So it's bang, no survivors
Only riders on my rider, murder rate rises
Stalkin' niggas on their IG's, never; I be
Still solo, Under Armour still Polo
No wire, on fire
My desire for fine things made me a liar, a shooter
Gettin' high feelin' like it's vodou
Nine lives, SK with the cooler
Makaveli in the 'Rari, still B-I double G, I, E
I pray you smoke with me
Go to bed with a kilo like Casino
Janet Reno, we all we got the creed of Nino
Pretty cars in the driveway
If you cut it then you sideways, double up, crime pays

[Hook: French Montana]
Momma's tryna save me but she don't know I'm tryna save her

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I'm from where the streets test you
Niggas mix business and pleasure where the cocaine measure
The narcotics is our product
The by-product, you walk up on me, I cock it
New Mercedes as it peels off
Nothin' penetrates the steel doors, gang signs, see 'em all
I said my prayer as I'm countin' sheep
Never really athletic, but I play for keeps, do you feel me?
The mortician, the morgue fillin' with more snitches
We kill 'em and takin' their bitches, R.I.P
Chinchillas on a winter night
Black bottles when I'm feelin' like, you wanna know what winners like
And I'm never on that tour bus
Just a decoy for niggas, the PJ's for two of us
Ciroc boys down to die for Diddy
My niggas ride for less, keep it real, homie, made me filthy
Touch mine, until it's even: kill
Like I'm knowin' every heathen will, closed the deal with Steven Hill
We Magic City of the networks
Cut a nigga cast off, how my nigga net worths

[Hook: French Montana]
Momma's tryna save me but she don't know I'm tryna save her
Man, them niggas tried to play me, man, 'til I got this paper
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you

[Outro: Diddy]
Fuck, y'all wanna talk about fuckin' jewelries and Bentley's and Hublot's and fuckin' art that niggas ain't got on their fuckin' walls and fuckin' mansions niggas ain't got. Niggas can't even pay the IRS, let alone their fuckin' staff, nigga. You gotta tell the truth, man. The truth'll set you free, son, the truth will set you free",Rick Ross,1983,"[94, 94]",2

Got out of town on a boat, going to Southern islands
Sailing a reach before a following sea
She was making for the trades on the outside
And the downhill run to Papeete
Off the wind on this heading lie the Marquesas
We got eighty feet of the waterline, nicely making way
In a noisy bar in Avalon, I tried to call you
But on a midnight watch I realized why twice you ran away

[Pre-Chorus]
Think about how many times I have fallen
Spirits are using me, larger voices calling
What heaven brought you and me cannot be forgotten

[Chorus]
I have been around the world
Looking for that woman-girl
Who knows love can endure
And you know it will

[Verse 2]
When you see the Southern Cross for the first time
You understand now why you came this way
Cause the truth you might be running from is so small
But it's as big as the promise, the promise of a coming day
So I'm sailing for tomorrow, my dreams are a dying
And my love is an anchor tied to you, tied with a silver chain
I have my ship and all her flags are a flying
She is all that I have left and music is her name

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
So we cheated and we lied and we tested
And we never failed to fail, it was the easiest thing to do

Now
Able to connect
With every  itty bitty breath
Makes the lust for papes and babes
Even complex
Fear less, I want
Even
Your
Mother
To hear this
House name in this game
So my name
You can   wear it


(Chorus)
They say underground
Real shit
Man I been here for years
Eyes open, that way I don’t shed any tears
Don’t sleep on the kid, that’s the cousin of fear



Verse 2
Underground  is where
They pree the raw skills
So once he leaves here
Does it mean he ignores skill
Doubt it
, came from little
Aim higher than middle
But respect from the people
With my world class  riddles
Some
Accolades would do
Want a pile to show tho
10 in total
Should He really get a MOBO
No-no
Cause I wanna
Leave my region
Japan to Sweden
Bump my shit in Cali
, that’s a true feeling
That’s  where I be heading
I’mma just start yelling
If my name ain’t  mentioned
With these so called legends
Way better
Whatever
No pressure
I’ll stay fresher
Get together
In this new found endeavour
Ayy
Build a dynasty
Physically
Mimick me
Lyrically
Pacino
He knows
We go
Mean tho
See tho
Steelo
Keen tho
Mean gene  flow
Preach yo
See tho
This flows peak yo


They say underground
Real shit
Man I been here for years
Eyes open, that way I don’t shed any tears
Don’t sleep on the kid, that’s the cousin of fear



Verse 3
Technique Immortal
Cause doom in my portal
I’m rugged like the man called RA
Sorta
Ain’t had an Afro since
Back in the day
Imma rock like Aesop
Stay lowkey
Ok
Be conscious like Akala
So the purists know me
Be a Badass like Joey
Big like Toby
Lil like boosie
Build my shit like Gucci
Or a school boy like q
Be a kid like bookie
Be as Big as Krit
Dont ever quit
Build my hustle Nipsey

535,Love Me Tomorrow,"[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Yeah
You might not like some of the things that I do
Or the things I say
But guarantee you, you gon' love me tomorrow
Fo' sho'

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
She love she love me not
But I never real touchy lovey dovey for what he got
Suddenly kissy huggy what is for me the buddy slot
But they callin' me to put it right in the open it could be an ugly stop
She's lookin' to be caressed on the reg
Fetched on the reg, sex on the reg
Only Techs on the bread
With nothin' but busting percussion and checks on the head
As she huffin' and puffin' 'cause wasn't no Tech on the bed
And she don't like that Tech N9ne persona
Groupies more groupies for true they be juicy like John Bedushi
Like the one that do movies, man ay caramba
You google me I'm beyond the boobies and champaignya
Bumbaclot don't shrug me 'cause I'm the rapper
But again you fond of da slacker who's been on your love
Peace in your honor, just trusting can calm ya
She stoned now I'm home but she gon' love me mañana

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Can't stand to hear my name or see my face
But every time she does she feels disgraced
But she gon' love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)
Love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)
Love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)
Love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
What kinda fan are you
Just because I expanded you ban a dude
Like I do soft musical Xanadu
But I'll be damn if you slander who Tech N9na
My crew cannibals ain't no fan of a true man
Who do a lot in a jam or two
Said I'm a sell out 'cause I worked with Wayne
First your brain needs work you hurt the game
Every lyric that we blurst put the earth to shame
How do we burst to fame if both of our verse the same
We supposed to be different, you know that we gifted
'Cause what we spit you know that we live it
We grow 'cause we vivid
You's a fair weather fan, your predictions will never stand
Like you know something better than when I'm chopping
Whatever man

[Spoken]
I told my fans, that, I told them this years ago. I said Tech will never go mainstream, mainstream will go Tech

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I hear ya saying that I ain't the same
But in order to grow you know you got to change
But you gon' love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)
Love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)
Love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)
Love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)

[Verse 3: Big Scoob]
Here today but be gone when you blink an eye
Constant drinking got you thinking and you about cry
I was forsaken life taken can you feel the pain
Heart breakin' body shakin' can you stand the rain
I was a friend of thee but treated like an enemy
But now I'm gone just a portion of your memories
But in your memory 'member this vividly
There was no other villain from the hood real as me
From the soil none loyal like the B.I.G
Homie from the show me, hope that's how you 'member me
And we'll soon see I ain't got long to be
On this earth claiming turf running in these streets
I apologize homie look me in my eyes
Time to turn the page be a man and swallow pride
Too many homies died before I got to say my piece
So I just said my piece and hopin' that it brings us peace

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Today is gone and I left this place
But I'll be the sun shining on your face
So just love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)
Love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)
Love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)
Love me tomorrow (Love me tomorrow)",Tech N9ne,1983,[91],1
536,Destination Unknown,"[Verse 1]
I see life
And it's passing right before my eyes
And the past is the past
Don't regret it
Time to realize
I need to walk on the wire
Just to catch my breath
I don't know how or where
But I'm going it's all that I have left

[Pre-Chorus]
It don't matter where it takes me
Long as I can keep this feeling
Running through my soul

[Chorus]
Never took this road before
Destination unknown
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Destination unknown
Won't be coming back this way
Gotta go it alone
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,oh
Destination unknown

[Verse 2]
See a chance
Gotta take it
Wanna meet my fate
'Cause the last thing I ever wanted
Was to find out it's too late
No way out when you're in it
Deeper than the night
There's a light at the end of the tunnel
And I see it burning bright

[Pre-Chorus]
It don't matter where it takes me
Long as I can keep this feeling
Running through my soul

[Chorus]
Never took this road before
Destination unknown
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Destination unknown
Won't be coming back this way
Gotta go it alone
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,oh
Destination unknown

[Pre-Chorus]
It don't matter where it takes me
Long as I can keep this feeling
Running through my soul",Marietta Waters,1983,[92],1
537,Forever Mine,"[Verse 1]
My heart has been a chessboard
Making moves and losing out
Played so many times before
And there ain't nothing to brag about
But this must be a new brew
When you're gone I'm singing Blue Moon
You turn me all the way around
And I'm tired of the fine line

[Chorus]
I just want you to be forever mine
Be forever mine

Oh and there's nothing I can sing now
That ain't been sung before
Oh but your love is a standout
So go on ahead and take the floor
You had to Jimi my heart loose
Now I'm stuck in your voodoo
Pick me up, don't ever put me down
Look I'm tired of the fine line

[Chorus]
I just want you to be forever mine
I want you to be forever mine

[Bridge]
The way that you move, never seen it before
Looking for my head, can’t find it no more
You ransom my heart and I get the reward
Winning the crown like a Trojan horse
I come back, back, back every time
You got me shook like the Mobb when they rhyme
Come out of nowhere come blessing my life
I just want you to be forever mine, oh oh

[Chorus]
Be forever mine
Be forever mine

[Verse 3]
Oh but you was cookin' up a new stew
Must have put something in my food
Cause now I'm lost up in the clouds
Oh and I'm tired of the fine line

[Chorus]
I just want you to be forever mine
Oh you gotta be, be forever mine",Andra Day,1983,[96],1
538,I'm So Excited,"[Verse 1]
Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen
Tonight we'll put all other things aside
Give in this time and show me some affection
We're going for those pleasures in the night

[Pre-Hook]
I want to love you, feel you
Wrap myself around you
I want to squeeze you, please you
I just can't get enough
And if you move real slow I'll let it go

[Hook]
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
And I know, I know, I know, I know
I know I want you

[Verse 2]
We shouldn't even think about tomorrow
Sweet memories will last a long, long time
We'll have a good time baby, don't you worry
And if we're still playing 'round, boy that's just fine

[Hook]
Let's get excited, we just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
And I know, I know, I know, I know
I know I want you, want you

[Pre-Hook]
I want to love you, feel you
Wrap myself around you
I want to squeeze you, please you
I just can't get enough
And if you move real slow I'll let it go

[Hook]
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
And I know, I know, I know, I know
I know I want you, want you

I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited, and I can't deny it
And I know, I know, I know, I know
I know I want you, want you

I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it


[Outro]
Look what you do to me
You’ve got me burning up
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ow!

How did you get to me?
I’ve got to give it up
Oh, oh, oh, oh ow!",The Pointer Sisters,1983,[98],1
