0,Hey Ya!,"[Intro: André 3000]
1, 2, 3, uh!

[Verse 1: André 3000]
My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so, and this I know for sure (Uh)
But does she really wanna
But can't stand to see me walk out the door? (Ah)
Don't try to fight the feeling
'Cause the thought alone is killing me right now (Uh)
Thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking to together 'cause we don't know how (C'mon)

[Chorus: André 3000]
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!

[Verse 2: André 3000]
You think you've got it, oh, you think you've got it
But “got it” just don't get it 'til there's nothing at all
We get together, oh, we get together
But separate's always better when there's feelings involved
If what they say is “Nothing is forever”
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes, what makes, what makes love the exception?
So why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh
Are we so in denial when we know we're not happy here?
Y'all don't want to hear me, you just want to dance

[Chorus: André 3000]
Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
Don't want to meet your daddy
Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
Just want you in my Caddy (Uh-oh)
Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
Don't want to meet your mama (Uh-oh)
Hey ya! Uh-oh
Just want to make you cumma (Uh-oh)
Hey ya! Uh-oh
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm just being honest (Uh-oh)
Hey ya!
I'm just being honest

[Bridge 1: André 3000]
Hey, alright now, alright now, fellas (Yeah?)
Now, what's cooler than being cool? (Ice Cold!)
I can't hear ya
I say what's, what's cooler than being cool? (Ice Cold!)
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Okay now, ladies (Yeah?)
Now, we gon' break this thing down in just a few seconds
Now don't have me break this thing down for nothing
Now I want to see y'all on your baddest behavior
Lend me some sugar, I am your neighbor
Ah, here we go!

[Refrain: André 3000]
Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, sh-shake it (Uh-oh)
Shake it, sh-shake it, Shake it, shake it, sh-shake it (Uh-oh)
Shake it like a Polaroid picture, hey ya!
Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, shake it (okay), shake it, sugar

Boom, boom, boom
Ha-ha!

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Ready for action, nip it in the bud
We never relaxing, OutKast is everlasting
Not clashing, not at all
But see, my nigga went to do a little acting
Now, that's for anyone asking, give me one pass 'em
Drip-drip-drop, there goes an eargasm
Now you cumming out the side of your face
We tapping right into your memory banks—thanks!
So click it or ticket, let's see your seat belt fastened
Trunk rattling, like two midgets in the backseat 'rassling
Speakerboxxx vibrate the tag
Make it sound like aluminum cans in the bag
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S bass?
But I know y'all wanted that 808

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
The whole room fell silent, the girls all paused with glee
Turning left, turning right, are they looking at me?
Well I was looking at them, there there on the dancefloor
Now they got me in the middle, feeling like a manwhore
Especially the big girl
Big girls need love too, no discrimination here, squirrel
So keep your hands off my cheeks
Let me study how you ride the beat, you big freak
Skinny-slim women got the cameltoe within them
You can hump them, lift them, bend them
Give them something to remember
Yell out ""Timber!"" when you fall through the chop shop
Take a deep breath and exhale
Your ex-male friend/boyfriend's boring as hell
But let me listen to the story you tell
And we can make moves like a person in jail
On the low, ho

I like the way you move

[Verse 3: Sleepy Brown]
Hey, baby, girl, don't you stop it
Come on, lady, dance all around me
(Look so fine) You look so fine (Look so fine)
You driving me out of my, out of my mind
Out my mind, ooooh, baby
If I could, I would just be with you, baby
Oooh, 'cause you light me, and excite me
And you know, you got me baby, woo!

Whoop ass, let security carry them out
Watch out for the medallion, my diamonds are reckless
It feels like a midget is hanging from my necklace
I pulled up with a million trucks
Looking, smelling, feeling like a million bucks, ahh
Pass the bottles, the heat is on
We in the huddle all smoking that Cheech & Chong
What's wrong? The club and the moon is full
And I'm looking for a thick, young lady to pull
One sure shot way to get them out of them pants
Take note to the brand new dance

Tell your little friend he can quit mean mugging

But where the fuck is the waitress at with my drinks?
My people outside and they can't get in
We gon' rush the back door & break them in
The owner already pissed cause we sort of late
But our time and our clothes, got to coordinate
Most girls looking right, some looking a mess
That's why they spilling drinks all over your dress
But Louis Vuitton bras all over your breasts
Got me wanting to put hickeys all over your chest
Ahh, come on we gon' party tonight
Y'all use mouth to mouth bring the party to life
Don't be scared, show another part of your life
The more drinks in your system, the harder the fight

Damn right, the fire marshal wanna shut us down
Get us out, so someone can gun us down
We was two songs away from getting some cut up
Now we one song away from tearing the club up
Move over; Luda got something to say
Do it now cause tomorrow ain't promised today
Work with me, let's become one with the beat
And don't worry about me stepping all over your feet

5,Walked Outta Heaven,"[Verse 1: Brian]
I'm rolling down a lonely highway
Asking God to please forgive me
For messing up the blessing he gave to me, I see, everything clearer now

I pray that he would just shed his grace on me
I need just to be back with my baby

See my mama told me that's if its meant to be
She'll come back and she'll forgive me
And the best thing I can do it to just let her, let her go

But if I continue to push she'll just pull away
And I know that in my heart its a reality
I didn't treat her like she wanted to be treated
And I hope that shes not gone for good no no

6,Here Without You,"[Verse 1]
A hundred days have made me older

But I hope that it gets better as we go

But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time

And tonight, girl, it's only you and me, yeah

When it's all said and done
It gets hard, but it won't take away my love

[Verse 2: Chingy]
Ma showed up like ""what's the hold up?""
Man know what, get them wraps and roll up
I took a chick in the bathroom seeing what's poppin
You know what's on my mind, shirts off and panties dropping
Niggas knocking on the door drunk, acting silly
The girl said ""can I be in yo video"" I'm like ""yeah!"", ""oh really?""
Now she naked strip teasing, me I'm just cheesing
She gave me a reason to be a damn heathen
Handled that, told ol' G, bring tha camera
Then I thought about, no footage as I ram her
Walked out the bathroom smiling, cats still wilding
Sharing the next room with some girls looking like they from an island

Stop, drop, KABOOM!, baby rub on your nipples
Some call me Ludacris, some call me Mr. Wiggles
Far from little, make ya mammary glands jiggle
Got 'em under control, with a bowl of Tender Vittles
Doc-tor giggles, I can't stop until it tickles
Just play a little ""D"" and I'll make ya mouth dribble
Bits and Kibbles, got 'em all after the pickle
I swing it like a bat, but these balls are not Wiffle
Hit 'em in triples, with no strikes, stripes, or whistles
I ain't felt this good, since my wood lived off a thistle
Sippin' some ripple, I got quarters, dimes, and nickels
For shizzle dizzle, I'm on a track with the Big Snoop Dizzle
Let the Henny trickle, down the beat, with a ghetto tempo
I done blazed the instrumental, laid it plain and simple
Getting brain in the rental, I done did it again
My eyes chinky, I'm with Chingy, at the Holiday Inn

I'mma bring the Cool Whip, then I want you to strip
See you is my new chick, so we get our grind on
She be grabbing, calling me Biggie, like Shyne home
Man I swear she fine homes, why she always lying though?
Telling me them diamonds, when she know they rhinestones
She got a light-skinned friend, look like Michael Jackson
Got a dark-skinned friend, look like Michael Jackson
I played Ready for the World,she was ready for some action

[Interlude: Aisha Tyler & Kanye West]
Now Kanye, I know I told you to slow it down, baby
And it's good, it's all good, it's beautiful, it's beautiful
But now I need you to do it faster, baby
Can you please? Do it faster baby, do it faster!
Damn, baby; I can't do it that fast...
But I know somebody who can, Twista!

[Verse 2: Twista]
Got you looking at the gliss' on my hands and wrists
While I'm laying back and smoking on my cannabis
When it come to rocking the rhythm like Marvin and Luther
I can tell you ain't no messin' with Kan-man and Twist
In the Chi, and I be sipping Hennessy
Play some R&B while I smoke a B
You can't fuck with me, put that on a G
And all is (Well well well well)
Come with me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne
You ain't know Twista can work it like The Whispers?
Hit the stop light, movin' to some Ides
His rims still moving so I bump a little Spinners
While I'm smoking on a B, dipping through the streets
Bumping R&B, and I got the heat on them 23's
And I do it (Well well well well)
With my Earth in the Wind smokin' Fire
Let me get your sheets wet listening to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze with Maze
Fulfilling her with every temptation, slow-jamming, having deep sex
You Ready for the World, girl? Come on go with me
I'll touch you all over your body, baby don't say no to me
And every note'll be controlling me
I'm loving the way you be holding me when I be listening to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend your ass
You be bumpin' Teddy Pendergrass
I done hit it from the back to the melody of ""Roll It Slow""
Now I gotta go up in it fast, but I'mma finish last
No matter how much of a thug, you see
I still spit it like its R&B, go to the club with me
And with some Luther come on
I hope you feelin' me and still gon' be in love with me, and I ride...

19,Runnin (Dying To Live),"[Intro: Rob May & 2Pac]
Between you and Biggie it was like, who's going to rule the
Nigga kingdom and shit, basically, know what I'm saying?
I was like, this is like a fucking election
It is that
You know what I am saying
Me and Biggie's situation is smaller than that, it's like…

[Hook]
And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
(You don't know)
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Check it, I grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up
Choppin' rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls tryna turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missin'
Show they toes, you know they got stepped on
A fistful of bullets, a chest full of Teflon
Runnin' from the police, picture that
Nigga, I'm too fat, I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back, it don't faze me
When he drop, take his Glock and I'm Swayze
Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight
Lay back, I got some money to make, motherfucker

[Hook]
And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?
(It's on me)

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
But still I'm havin' memories of high speed when the cops crashed
As I laugh, pushin' the gas while my Glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb, but we had heart
In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts?
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies, now the whole world's tryna screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?
But stay true, sippin' 22's of brew
And now media is tryna test me
Got the press askin' questions, tryna stress me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested, and flipped
He screamed ""Thug Life!"" and emptied the clip
Got tired of runnin' from the police

[Hook]
And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

[Outro: 2Pac]
They wanted a new regime. And my regime includes East coast, includes West coast

[The Notorious B.I.G.]
I was more shocked than anything
You know what I'm sayin'?
But I wasn't more shocked of him dying
I was more shocked of him… Pac is a strong dude, yo
I know dude, you know what I'm sayin'? Real strong
So when they was like he got shot, I was just more like, ""Again?"" you know what I'm sayin'?
He always getting shot, or shot at
He going to pull through this one again
Make a few records about it, and it's going to be over
You know what I'm sayin'?
But when he, when he died, I was just like, ""whoa"", you know what I'm saying? Kinda took me by
I mean, even though we was going through our drama
I would never wish death on nobody
You know what I'm sayin'?
Because there ain't no coming back from that",2Pac,2003,"[20, 19, 20, 20, 26, 27, 39, 43, 47, 61, 75]",11

I'll teach you how to stunt
My wrists stay rocked up
My TV's pop up in a Maybach Benz
I'll teach you how to stunt
Nigga you can't see me
My Bentley GT got smoke-gray tints
I'll teach you how to stunt
My neck stay blinging, my rims stay gleaming, I'm shining man
I'll teach you how to stunt
I see you scheming, nigga keep on dreaming, I hurt ya man
I'll teach you how to stunt

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Seven series BM, six series Benz
Twenty-four inches, Giovanni rims
R1 one wheel when I'm on one of them
Ma, that boy out there acting a fool that's him
They say I've changed man, I'm getting paper, I'm flashy
They like me better when I'm fucked up and ashy
My royalty check's the rebirth of Liberace
Stunt so hard, everybody got to watch me
And I don't really care if it's platinum or white gold
As long as the VS bling, look at that light show
In the hood they say 50 man your sneaker look right yo
Just can't believe Reebok did a deal with a psycho
Banks is a sure thing, y'all niggas might blow
I'm fin to drop that, so I suggest you lay low
Buck, he from Cashville, Ten-a-key nigga
We getting them ten a ki', save ten for me nigga

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
I'm sensing a lot of tension now that I'm rapping
But the kids used to look up to you, what happened?
Me on the contrary, hand covered with platinum
Different color coupes but I'm in love with the black one
On point, cause you get R.I.P.'s when slacking
So the stash box big enough to squeeze the MAC in
Yeah, I'm fairly new but I demand some respect
Cause I already wear your advance on my neck
I'm fresh off the jet, then I breeze to the beaches
Blue Yankee fitted, G-Unit sneakers
I already figured out what to do with all my features
Decorate the basement, full of street sweepers
When it comes to stunting there's nothing you can teach us
We're in a different time zone, your records don't reach us
Naww, I ain't here to save the world, just roll up a blunt
Come with me out front, I'LL TEACH YOU HOW TO STUNT

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I'll teach you how to stunt
My wrists stay rocked up

I see you scheming, nigga keep on dreaming, I hurt ya man
I'll teach you how to stunt

[Verse 3: Young Buck]
Chain so icy, you don't have to like me
In a throwback jersey, with the throwback Nikes
I know you probably seen me with Cash Money from back in the days
The only thing changed is the numbers on the Range
I bought me an old school and blew out the brains
The Roc the Mic tour, I threw off my chain
My Sprewell's spinning man, I'm doing my thing
And whodi now in trouble now that you in the game
Come on now, we all know gold is getting old
The ice in my teeth keep the Cristal cold
G-Unit homie, acting like y'all don't know
Look, I can't even walk through the mall no more
I just pull up, get out, and get all the hoes
They never seen doors lift up on a car before
Don't be mad at me dog, that's all I know
That's how to show these fugazies how it's supposed to go, yeah

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I'll teach you how to stunt
My wrists stay rocked up

21,Why Don't You & I,"[Verse 1: Chad Kroeger]
Since the moment I spotted you
Like walking 'round with little wings on my shoes
My stomach's filled with the butterflies
Ooh, and it's alright
Bouncing 'round from cloud to cloud
I got the feeling like I'm never gonna come down
If I said I didn't like it, then you know I'd lied, ooh

[Pre-Chorus: Chad Kroeger]
But every time I try to talk to you
I get tongue-tied
Turns out everything I say to you
Comes out wrong and never comes out right

[Chorus: Chad Kroeger]
So I'll say, ""Why don't you and I get together
And take on the world and be together forever?
Heads we will, and tails we'll try again""
So I say, ""Why don't you and I hold each other
And fly to the moon and straight on to heaven?
'Cause without you, they're never gonna let me in""

[Verse 2: Chad Kroeger]
When's this fever gonna break?
I think I've handled more than any man can take
I'm like a love-sick puppy chasing you around
Ooh, and it's alright
Bouncing 'round from cloud to cloud
I got the feeling like I'm never gonna come down
If said I didn't like it, then you know I'd lied, ooh

Slowly, I begin to realize, this is never gonna end
Right about the same time you walk by

You never met a nigga like me
Yo yo, have you ever seen a little dude
Who be doing what I do?
Uh huh, yo whoo!
Let's get at it dog, whoo!

[Verse 1: Murphy Lee]
Now what goes up, must come down (shiiett)
But we ain't coming down, it be them same ol' clowns
Aiming your pound, pretending they proud
But when you leave town they go around they running they mouth (maaann)
They something like a hater, man
Talking bad about a playa as if I'm not gon' see ya later, man
You constantly frontin' until you confronted on
If you don't like whats going on goin' to another song
'Cause I keep a hater guilty
My cars and my money all alike man, both them filthy (get it?)
From skimpy and empty to fuel on full
See I be high when my 'Ca-go Bulls
Obey no rules to school you fools
Schoolboy's err'y where, we're Young Dude news (maann)
St. Louis like Blues, D. Miles and Larry Hughes
And the Young Dude done paid young dudes' dues dude

[Hook] 2x
[JD:] But yo, what da hook gon' be? (Uh oh!)
[ML:] See I don't need no fucking hook on this beat (Shiieet)
All I need is the track in the background
My headphones loud, keep the blunt goin' 'round and I'mma rip

[Verse 2: Murphy Lee]
The sun'll come out... tomorrow
And I will never have to borrow
Got my first car when I turned sixteen
Only drove it home outta town limousines
Plus we was broke wit a deal but nobody could tell
So we did what we had to do for ""Country Grammar"" to sell
Haha, I stay on my own melodies
Plus I like my booties and my boobs like a capital letter 'B'
That's how it is, how it better be
I preferably rather have two or three girls in the bed wit' me
Close your ears, ma, you ain't heard nothing (what?)
I always pay ma, let a brother hold something
I'm basically coming from nothing to something
When I say nothing meaning pocket full of lint and buttons
(We all we got!) Used to be creative on Halloween (how you gon?)
Stop a hotter teen went from nada to a lot of things

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3: Murphy Lee]
People always saying man it must be nice
No hi, no nothing, not a simple ""how's life?""
Understand the money's good but I'm still from the hood
So don't be asking for no ""inch"" and be expecting the ""foot""
Unless you want a foot (whoo!)
I know a few crooks that can place you where you need to be put
And it might not cost me playa
Got a Benz pepper interior, paint salty playa
And we all push it, but me I push it real good
Brains blown out, chromed out, wheel real wood
Catch me on your local derrty
Or in the studio doing vocals derrty
I'm the same dude that came through wit my crew
Let the girls do me while you do you
And um, all I need is JD beat to be banging
And I'll come up wit these verses that I'm usually slanging

Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Verse 2]
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

[Chorus 2]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

25,White Flag,"[Verse 1]
I know you think that
I shouldn't still love you
Or tell you that
But if I didn't say it
Well, I'd still have felt it
Where's the sense in that?
I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder
Or return to where we were

[Chorus]
I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

[Verse 2]
I know I left too
Much mess and destruction
To come back again
And I caused nothing but trouble
I understand if you
Can't talk to me again
And if you live by the rules of ""it's over""
Then I'm sure that that makes sense

[Chorus]
I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

And when we meet
Which I'm sure we will
All that was there
Will be there still
I'll let it pass
And hold my tongue
And you will think
That I've moved on

I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door

26,Numb,"[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
And I know I may end up failing, too
But I know you were just like me
With someone disappointed in you

I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Light 'em up, light 'em up
Tell me where you are, tell me where you are
The summer nights, the bright lights
And the shooting stars, they break my heart

[Pre-Chorus 1: Jamie Scott]
I'm calling you now, but you're not picking up
Your shadows so close if you are still in love
Then light a match, light a match
Baby, in the dark, show me where you are

[Chorus: Jamie Scott]
Oh, love
How I miss you every single day when I see you on those streets
Oh, love
Tell me there's a river I can swim that will bring you back to me

You're calling me now, but I can't pick up
Your shadow's too close, and I'm still in love

We could have had the stars, oh

Oh, love
How I miss you every single day when I see you on those streets

28,There Goes My Life,"[Verse 1]
All he could think about was I'm too young for this
Got my whole life ahead
Hell, I'm just a kid myself
How'm I going to raise one

All he could see were his dreams going up in smoke
So much for ditching this town
And hangin' out on the coast
Oh well, those plans are long gone

[Chorus]
And he said
There goes my life
There goes my future, my everything
Might as well kiss it all good-bye
There goes my life

[Verse 2]
A couple years of up all night
And a few thousand diapers later
That mistake he thought he made covers up the refrigerator
Oh yeah, he loves that little girl

Momma's waiting to tuck her in
As she fumbles up those stairs
She smiles back at him
Dragging that teddy bear
Sleep tight, blue eyes and bouncing curls

[Chorus]
He smiles
There goes my life
There goes my future, my everything
I love you, daddy good-night
There goes my life

[Verse 3]
She had that Honda loaded down
With Abercrombie clothes and 15 pairs of shoes
And his American Express
He checked the oil and slammed the hood
Said you're good to go
She hugged them both and headed off to the West Coast

[Chorus]
And he cried
There goes my life
There goes my future, my everything
I love you
Baby, good-bye

Out of her skirt, dancing on mirrors, into her nostrils
She plottin' on fossil because of the way I'm spreadin' my gospel
Hella apostles, bitch, who trying to stop me
Judas with Ruger can't even come pop me
I hope that these niggas don't try to 2Pac me
The only one scared about being too poppin
But no other option, being broke not an option
I'd rather get rope and then climb to the top
Then jump the fuck off and then kill myself
You know what the fuck I'm saying
Fuck that shit
Get this dough
Fuck that bitch
Wrist done froze
Broke my wrist
Tryna fist fuck a bitch
I need flight, fee, hotel now
Don't like me, oh well now
You should have held me down
Now I'm just gonna watch you drown
I'm back on clear boy fuck the brown
Yeah, I feel fantastic
Shorty says she so elastic
Nasty, ass thick, doll face, plastic
She can't fathom how i split her atoms
Leave her soaking wet, jerkin', hurtin', having spasms
A cataclysm when a nigga hit
Cryptic, my tongue you can't decipher shit
I'm whippin', I'm whippin', pneumonia my wrist
Walk right in your shit, give no fuck about your list
'Cause I need a check
Young hot ebony and pale brunette
You can miss me with that shit bout who next
While I flex, flex, flex, flex, flex, flex

Why can't I cry money instead of tears?
Ride around in brand new gear
Hella ammo, no more fear
Why can't I cry money instead of tears?

I could never have career
Why can't I cry money instead of tears?

[Intro: Gigolo]
(Gigolo & La Exce)
En busca de caricias muertas y algunas esperanzas rotas
Me enrede entre sus entrepiernas y así besando su boca
Fui culpable sin pensarlo, un trago dulce amargo
Sólo quiero hablarte claro, tengo que confesarte

[Coro: Bad Bunny]
Anoche me acosté con otra
Tu sexto sentido no se equivoca
Siempre me pilla cuando le miento
No fue intencional, baby lo siento

Anoche me acosté con otra
Desperté en otra cama sin ropa
Sexo y drogas, una noche loca
Tu sexto sentido no se equivoca

[Verso 1: Bad Bunny]
(Bad Bunny Baby)
Ta' cabrón que yo a ti te la pegue
Aunque bien tú bregue'
Por más que me cocines y fregues
No te acuesta' hasta que llegue
Y yo con una puta to' los jueves, yeh
Otra vez me equivoqué
Te juro que me sentí sucio cuando a otra yo toqué
Yo no sé ni porque
Ella fue la que vino donde mí, yo no la provoqué
Si te quieres ir yo lo voy a entender
Tienes mil razones para no volver
Me da miedo no volverte a ver
Pero es lo que merezco por infiel, yeh
Otra vez me equivoqué
Te juro que me sentí sucio cuando a otra yo toqué
Yo no sé ni porque
Ella fue la que vino donde mí, yo no la provoqué

Anoche me acosté con otra
Amanecimo' en un hotel
Me guayé con una baby bien durota
Tú no vas a entender, porque tú eres mujer

No quiero justificarme, tú eres otra cosa aparte
Contigo no me protejo pero siempre woa' cuidarte
Después de la nota que cojimos, tengo que confesarte

If you got 10 then bring a friend
Ho shake your ass till the song end
If you ain't wit' it, well go on, then!

Jeans sagging so I can see her thong a lil bit

In real life, girl remind me of Pocahontas
She be at events, cuss out the press when she pass
All the high rolling cats wanna pay for that ass
Ain't no half stepping, she strapped with a nice weapon
Trick, it's against the law for her to move them hips
If you ever seen her dirty, your mouth gonna drop
Worldwide fools probably tell you this off tops

Young girl, it's alright
Your tears will dry, you'll soon be free to fly, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're safe inside your room, you tend to dream
Of a place where nothing's harder than it seems
No one ever wants or bothers to explain
Of the heartache life can bring and what it means

[Chorus]
When there's no one else
Look inside yourself
Like your oldest friend
Just trust the voice within
Then you'll find the strength
That will guide your way
You'll learn to begin
To trust the voice within

You'll never change if you just run away (Ooh, oh yeah)
Young girl, just hold tight
Soon you're gonna see your brighter day

Now in a world where innocence is quickly claimed
It's so hard to stand your ground when you're so afraid

Look inside yourself

Just trust the voice within
Then you'll find the strength

Life is a journey
It can take you anywhere you choose to go
As long as you're learning
You'll find all you'll ever need to know

Just don’t forsaken it because
No one can tell you what you can’t do
No one can stop you, you know that I’m talking to you

How dare you say that my behavior's unacceptable
So condescending, unnecessarily critical
Have the tendency of getting very physical
So watch your step cause if I do, you'll need a miracle
Drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here
The double vision I was seeing is finally clear
You want to stay but you know very well I want you gone
[Gibberish]

[Chorus]
When it gets cold outside and you've got nobody to love
Understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
Like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

[Verse 2]
What you're doing is screwing things up inside my head
You should know better, never listened to a word I said
Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat
Hoping someday somebody will do you like I did

[Chorus]
When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

I think that I've got irritable bowel syndrome
Ugh, I gotta pee!

[Bridge]
Does it kill, does it burn
Is it painful to learn
It's me that has the control

Does it thrill, does it sting
When you feel what I bring
And you wish that you had me to hold

[Chorus]

37,(There's Gotta Be) More To Life,"[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I've got it all, but I feel so deprived
I go up, I come down, and I'm emptier inside
Tell me what is this thing that I feel like I'm missing
And why can't I let it go?

[Chorus]
There's gotta be more to life
Than chasing down every temporary high
To satisfy me
'Cause the more that I'm tripping
I'm thinking there must be more to life
Well, there's life, but I'm sure
There's gotta be more
(Than wanting more...)

[Verse 2]
I've got the time and I'm wasting it slowly
Here in this moment, I'm halfway out the door
Onto the next thing, I'm searching for something that's missing

[Chorus]
There's gotta be more to life
Than chasing down every temporary high
To satisfy me
'Cause the more that I'm trippin'
I'm thinkin' there must be more to life
Well, there's life, but I'm sure
There's gotta be more
I'm wanting more

[Bridge]
Oh, I'm always waiting on something other than this
Why am I feeling like there's something I missed?
(Something I missed, yeah)

[Chorus]
There's gotta be more to life
Than chasing down every temporary high
To satisfy me
'Cause the more that I'm (More that I'm) trippin'

Well, there's life, but I'm sure
There's gotta be more to life

38,Through The Wire,"[Music Video]
[Produced by Kanye West]

[Intro]
Yo, Gee, they can't stop me from rappin', can they?
Can they, Hop?

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Over Chorus]
I spit it through the wire, man
There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man
I'd gladly risk it all right now
It's a life-or-death situation, man
Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man
It's your boy, Kanye to the…
Chi-Town, what's goin' on?

[Verse 1]
I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizzerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band
I swear, this right here, history in the makin', man

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Over Chorus]
I really apologize for everything right now
If it's unclear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut
For like… I dunno, the doctor said like six weeks
Y'know, he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
I looked in the mirror
And half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man
This what I got to say right here, dawg
Yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh

[Verse 2]
What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds
It was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!)
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I…
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Outro Over Chorus]
Y'know what I'm sayin'?
When the doctor told me I had, um
That I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin, I said
""Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?""
""It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!""
You can't be serious, man",Kanye West,2003,"[39, 52, 74, 89, 94]",5

I'm talkin' to myself in public
And dodgin' glances on the train
And I know
I know they've all been talkin' 'bout me
I can hear them whisper
And it makes me think there must be somethin' wrong

Out of all the hours thinkin'
Somehow
I've lost my mind

But soon enough you're gonna think of me
And how I used to be

I've been talkin' in my sleep
Pretty soon they'll come to get me
Yeah, they're takin' me away

Done been through so much shit that I'm numb to it, don't feel pain

And when you talk, I got my lasers on you like a UFO
Girl your eyes are like the open sea, the simple poetry
This whole generation, OMG, I see your soul, it's older
We should build a city overseas, this country kinda cold
I mean they feed the children dopamine

Chance of finding you, one in a 100 thousand, whoa
I just wanna kiss you on the mountain, whoa

I might bend the rules
'Cause I'm in love with you

I will show you soon

She said, ""Love is a strong word"", said love is a strong word?
Well I'ma sing it for you baby, I'll be your song bird
If we don't have no loving, how we supposed to move onward?
Heard a brother just got shot because he stopped on the wrong curb
If love is a strong word, then love is a strong word
Then we'll need lots of loving if we wanna move onward
And I'ma sing it to you, baby, I'll be your song bird
But I'ma keep it honest with you

The way you answer makes me question you
I guess your body ain't the only thing that's flexible
You bend the truth, we lettin' loose, verbal warfare
Open wounds we still poke even tho we know it's sore there
Cause hurt people hurt people, that's a known fact

Didn't let me fuck right away you made me work for it
Use to ride around drunk you brought out the worst in me
Damn I went to jail with you and that was a first for me
Heaven knows that I was hell bent
First time we said we love each other was through cell vents
Guess I should've known then
But I'm stubborn I'll admit that
At least I got some classic rap songs from your mishaps
Shit I ain't perfect though, I stayed what's wrong with me
I'm in love with challenges, girl that's just honesty

Dividing an' deciding his and hers

An' one by one, she wrote down what she wanted most from him

""Honesty, sincerity, tenderness and trust
""A little less time for the rest of the world

An' said: ""You know this isn't easy for me.""
As he thought about the new car, the house an' the land
An' wondered what that bottom line would be
An' a thousand other things that she'd want him to leave behind
But he never dreamed he'd open up that napkin and find:

Well, he fought back the tears, as he looked in her eyes

They won't last

[Verse 4]
So let me kiss you now, little darling
Beneath this autumn moon
Cold wind, another season
Will be here soon

[Chorus]
And all I wanna do is let it be and be with you
And watch the wind blow by
And all I wanna see is you and me go on forever
Like the clear blue sky
Slowly, there's only
You and I
And all I want to do is watch the wind blow by
And all I want to do is watch the wind blow by
And all I want to do is watch the wind blow by",Tim McGraw,2003,"[61, 71, 75]",3

60,Clubbin,"[Couplet 1 : Lujipeka]
Dans le club j'fais un malheur, à l'école y'a un after
J'en dis pas plus, c'est dans les toilettes que ça suce
J’quitte mon palais de solitude, j'écris avec ma langue sur des palais
Place vide à côté de moi dans le bus, doigt dans le cul si j't'emballe
Me passe pas la laisse j'suis mal à l'aise, j'voulais juste m'amuser
Je me mens à moi-même, cartouche d'encre dans le barillet
Luji dis-nous qui t'es ?
Le juge va pas m'acquitter
Pas de glace que du verre pilé
Seul dans la foule j'arrête de respirer
J'suis raide, armé comme le RAID
J'paye ma bouteille #Belvedere
Les Femen en perdent leur hymen
Le Rimmel coule, c'est l'enfer

[Couplet 2 : Yro]
J'sors du psy pour danser sur d'la psy-trance
J'attends le bouche à bouche avant autopsie
Le caleçon plein de transpiration
J'lui tire son t-shirt comme à la récréation
J'pose le 9milli en vestiaire
J'l'ai croisée, je l'avais pas dans mon bestiaire
Il neige sur ma Tour Eiffel
Sur la piste j’leur parle en sous-titres FR
Refoulé pour une paire d'Asics, askip
Personne ne me connaît comme Dylan, Harris
La peinture fluo cache le sang sur mon torse
Pour se comprendre on textote en morse
Un gilet jaune et un gilet par balle dans le coffre
J’monte, je valide mon entrée en Enfer
T'inquiète on fera le soixante-neuf à l'envers
J’fête la fin du début de l'année scolaire
J’fête la fin du début, j’fête la fin du début de l’année scolaire
Mon sac est prêt depuis trop longtemps
J'ai une bonne raison d’venir en avance
J’paye la tournée (j’paye la tournée)
J’danse comme un teubé (j’danse comme un teubé)
Selfie sur ma carte d'identité
J’la recrute pour un blowjob d'été

[Couplet 3 : Lujipeka]
Déchiffre mes rébus, j'découpe les sexes dans des revues porno
Elles grattent toutes à l'arbre comme le renard, j'suis perché comme corbeau
J'coupe les cordes vocales des voix dans ma tête
Sers-toi dans l'bocal, prend la plus grosse tête
Fumée toxique, feu sur la piste, j'l’éteins avec ma pisse
Clubbing for, Clubbing for Colombine

[Couplet 4 : Foda C]
Je sèche les cours pour aller mouiller ses lèvres
J'crève de chaud dans son sexe et j'meurs de froid jonché au sol comme un cadavre
Si on meurt de soif ce soir c'est pas grave
Les jurons ne suffisent plus à leur faire du mal
Alors je leur jette mes fleurs au visage
Il y a de la poudre à canon dans la recette du bonheur
On m'a mis devant la télé toute la journée
Comme une voiture garé sur une place handicapé avec les warning
Wa wa wa, j'ai uriné dans le long fleuve tranquille
Des tatouages Malabar #PrisonBreak
Avant de mourir je veux me faire un grec
J'm’assois toujours à côté d'elle
Parce qu'elle a apporte son matériel
Je l'aime parce qu'elle partage ma haine, des autres, des autres
J'dénonce les autres, j'défends les juifs
La boîte de nuit est atteinte de vaginisme
Faut que je sois plus le viril que le vigile
Mets de la javel dans cette piscine de sang
Si j'descends de mon nuage alors Dieu aussi
La peau violette sous la lumière noire
Au bout du tunnel, y'a des embouteillages
Pour avoir son num' y'aura emboucanage
Tu m'as quitté et la mort m'a trompé
Ce soir je casse la bouteille de Dom Pé'
Ma braguette veut croquer la vie à pleines dents
J'déprime dans le club à peine rentré d'dans

[Pont : Foda C]
Faut qu'j'fasse le refrain
J’suis trop bourré pour faire le refrain
J’suis trop bourré pour faire le refrain
J'peux pas faire le refrain
J'peux pas faire le refrain

I got a hole in my jeans

But it won't get to me

Because I'm riding with my baby
And it's a brand new day
We're on the wheels of an angel
Flying away

Across her pretty knees

I'll bear that cross with honor
Cause freedom don't come free

On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
""This could be Heaven or this could be Hell""
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

[Chorus: Don Henley]
""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here""

[Verse 2: Don Henley]
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes Benz
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
She calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain
""Please bring me my wine""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here since 1969""
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They living it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis""

Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said: ""We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device""
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before

But you can never leave!""

That pretty mouth say that dirty word
And I can't even remember now what she backed my truck into
But she covered her mouth and her face got red
And she just looked so darn cute
That I couldn't even act like I was mad
Yeah I live for little moments like that

[Verse 2]
Well that's just like this last year on my birthday
She lost all track of time and burnt the cake
And every smoke detector in the house was going off
And she was just about to cry until I took her in my arms
And I tried not to let her see me laugh
Yeah I live for little moments like that

[Verse 3]
I know she's not perfect but she tries so hard for me
And I thank god that she isn't cause how boring would that be
It's the little imperfections it's the sudden change in plans
When she misreads the directions and we're lost but holding hands
Yeah I live for little moments like that

[Verse 4]
When she's laying on my shoulder on the sofa in the dark
And about the time she falls asleep so does my right arm
And I want so bad to move it cause it's tingling and it's numb
But she looks so much like an angel that I don't want to wake her up

When she steals my heart again and doesn't even know it

71,Hit That,"[Verse 1]
The winds of fortune
Don't blow the same
She had to get out
And make a change
She had a kid now
But much too young
That baby daddy's out having fun

He's saying
I'm on a roll
With all the girls I know
His baby momma
She ain't so slow

Consequences are a lot, but hey
That's the way it
That's the way things go

[Verse 2]
What was a family
Is now a shell
We're raising kids now
Who raise themselves
Sex is a weapon
And it's like a drug
It gets him right into that grave that he just dug

She's saying
I'm on the run
I'm chasing guys for fun
Her baby daddy
It ain't his only one
She's saying
I'm on the run
I'm chasing guys for fun
I know you wanna hit that
I know you wanna hit that hit that
Everybody's gettin' with, I say
Consequences are a lot, but hey
That's the way it

[Bridge]
Well it winds up
Broken up
Really such a shame
But why not
Take a chance
Everything's a game
And it don't stop
Hooking up
Nothing's gonna change
The more he's trying
The more he's buying

[Chorus]
He says
I'm on a roll
With all the girls I know
His baby momma
Don't need to know
He's saying
I'm on a roll
With all the girls I know
I know you wanna hit that
I know you wanna hit that, hit that
All the world is gettin' with, I say
Consequences are a lot, but hey

72,Walking In Memphis,"[Verse 1]
Put on my blue suede shoes
And I boarded the plane
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues
In the middle of the pouring rain
W.C. Handy won't you look down over me
Yeah I got a first class ticket
But I'm as blue as a boy can be

[Hook]
Then I'm walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel

[Verse 2]
Saw the ghost of Elvis
On Union Avenue
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland
Then I watched him walk right through
Now security they did not see him
They just hovered around his tomb
But there's a pretty little thing
Waiting for The King
Down in the Jungle Room

[Chorus]
Then I'm walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel

[Bridge]
They've got catfish on the table
They've got gospel in the air
And Reverend Green will be glad to see you
When you haven't got a prayer
But boy you've got a prayer in Memphis

[Verse 3]
Now Muriel plays piano
Every Friday at the Hollywood
And they brought me down to see her
And they asked me if I would
Do a little number
And I sang with all my might
And she said
""Tell me are you a Christian child?""
And I said ""Ma'am I am tonight""

[Chorus]
I'm walking in Memphis
(Walking in Memphis)
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis

Some difference it makes
When we escape the time

The winter has made me wanted more, oh
You can't walk away from me
I'm thinking about your childhood gift, oh

All I'm looking for is you

You're the reason I'm still here
Am I the one you were sent to save

I wondered out into the water
And I thought that I might drown

Just know I was going down
That's when she found me
Not afraid anymore
She said you know I always had you baby
Just waiting for you to find what you were looking for

When you light those candles
Up there on that mantle, setting the mood

Silently preparing to love on you
Well, I can feel the heat
From across the room
Ain't it wild what a little flame can make you wanna do?

I melt, every time you look at me that way
It never fails
Anytime, any place
This burn in me is the coolest thing I've ever felt
I melt

[Verse 2]
Don't know how you do it
I love the way I lose it, every time
What's even better is knowing that forever you're all mine
The closer you get, the more my body aches
One little stare from you is all it takes

But I can’t steal what you never made up bitch
Y’all some duplicate rap cloning niggas
I manufacture you hoes -- put on your makeup, bitch
Let me explain, nothing’s been new since Big Daddy Kane
Flows will get recycled passed around to different names
But what’s the same, that every verse I spit is insane
Got more styles than any rapper in the game, 11 years and still counting
And y'all get a couple hit records, make some noise and have the nerve to start shouting
Who’s gassing ‘em, they blowing smoke up your ass, you fired up but I’m just puff puff passing ‘em
Until they roaches, buried in my ashtray
Nigga burn slow, better pray like it’s your last day
You lying to yourself, just admit it
May not like the way I use it but you know you ain't invent it boy
Do your research before you make a claim so bogus
That's disrespecting pioneers in the game
Fuck the fame but go ahead and get ya 5 minutes
Then you front line cadets can report to your lieutenants
See I’m ya past, I’m ya future and ya present
So watch ya fucking mouth when you speak about a legend
16 times platinum, 6 number 1 peaks
So I can give a fuck what you sold in ya first week
You’s weak, softer than the Pillsbury dough boy
Don’t make me expose the truth, you’s a ho, boy
Don’t make me get on that ""Stomp"" shit and get back at it
You rappers ain't even in my fucking tax bracket
Why am I wasting my time
Yeah I admit I get a little ludicrous with my rhymes, sometimes
But my fans know the difference because “My Chick Bad” went platinum
Still winning, motherfucker

The nerve of you niggas man
You ain't got enough medals on your jacket to address me boy
Fall back in formation, y’all outta line

Pulled up to the party, in a black Lexus jeep (yeah)
Hop up out the whip I'm feelin' freaky (ohh)
All the ladies comes surround me
Cause I'm so important, like the H in Hi-C
This one girl, she making my body fien
I'm {fucked} up on hypnotic and ice cream
So I stepped to her, like I knew her
Introduced her to Jacob the Jewler
Mami won't you come take a ride with me (ohh)

But first won't you do one thing for me
Baby won't you come pop ya booty for me (0hh)

[Verse 3 - Jermaine Dupri]
I don't do too many skinny or the runway frail
Thick with it is how we like it in the ATL
Sick with it, pants low with a real wide load
As soon as you hit the door everybody was like (OOOOH!)
And it's hard for you to go to the mall and buy clothes
Cause your waist is so little and your ass is like (WHOA!)
You poppin' that thing like a Luke video
Mesmerized by the sound and the way the flutes blow
Drink in my right hand, another in my left
Crew right behind me screamin So So Def
Now forgive me if I'm staring, but I gotta no one thing
How in the hell did you get all that in those jeans
I'm behind you +Grindin+, molding the +Clipse+
Cause I ain't never seen nobody pop they booty like dis
What I'm saying is, what you doing is major
The way you keep, shaking, shaking, shaking what cha momma gave ya

80,Love You More,"[Intro]
Still love me? Take this
You ready? One, two, three!

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more

[Verse 1]
It's sick but who could ever predict, we'd be doin' the same shit
We say we do it for our baby but we don't
We do it for us, it's lust 'cause neither one
Of us trust each other, so we fuck 'til we bust
And we cuss each other out, we know what it's about, shout
'Til I throw you out the house, you throw me out the house
I throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth
Fist fight 'til we turn this mother out
Then apologize after, laughter, pain
It's insane, we're back in the same chapter again
And it's sad but it's true, when I'm layin' here with you
There ain't nothin' anyone could ever say or ever do 'cause

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more

[Verse 2]
'Cause I hate you, do you hate me?
Good, 'cause you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry
It makes me wanna just take you and just throw you
On the bed and fuck you like I don't even know you
You fuck other people and I fuck other people
You're a slut, but I'm equal, I'm a mutt, we're both evil
In our ways but neither one of us would ever admit it
'Cause one us would have one up on the other so forget it
We can make accusations, people spread rumors
But they ain't got proof, 'til they do it's just the two of us
It's you and me, 'cause any chick can say that she screwin' me
But you gotta believe me to a degree 'cause true indeed
If you didn't, I wouldn't be hittin' — yeah, I would
'Cause the sex is too damn good, if I ran who would I run to
That would be this soft and warm?
So it's off and on, usually more off than on
But at least we know that we share this common bond
You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on
I hope, the only reason that I cope is 'cause of that fact
And plus I can bust in that and that's why

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more

[Verse 3]
I can never understand it, that's why I don't try
From junior high until we both die, it's silly
Oh, why must we try? Is it really so rough
That we must always call each other's Billy Goat's Gruff?
Try to pull each other's legs, until the other begs
We're lyin' to ourselves, that's the beauty of it, yeah!
'Cause we truly love each other, that's why we always fightin'
All we do is shove each other every other fuckin' night
And it's clear it ain't gonna change, it's pent-up rage
We both had, we both feel like we've been upstaged
By someone else, we've both been someone else's
""Someone else,"" problem is neither one wants help
It's an addiction and it can't be fixed
Our family's mixed up, there's a baby sister in the mix
And it hurts 'cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit
And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit
And they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time
On every song, every lyric and every rhyme
All the hoopla, all of the whoopty-woo
What you put me through, fuckin' whoopty-do
But I won't be made a fool of if this is true love
You wouldn't do what you did last time, you wouldn't screw up
This time, 'cause this time, girl, I'm tellin' you what
You do it again, I'm fuckin' you up

[Bridge]
No matter what you say, or what you do
I'ma hunt you down 'til I find you
No matter where you run, I'll be right there
Right behind you, in your nightmares
So I brought you the flowers and the candy
All the times that you threw it back at me
Told me you hate me, you gon' hate me more
When you find out, you can't escape me, whore

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on

I feel like a million bucks
But my money don't really feel like I do
And from the ground, I built my own damn buzz
People was amazed I was still in high school
But now I'm out, and money what I'm 'bout
Trying to get so much that I can't keep count
New kicks give me cushion like whoopie
Keep a smile like an Eat'n Park cookie
Everything good, I'm white boy awesome
Up all night, Johnny Carson
I ain't got a Benz, no just a Honda
But try to get my money like an Anaconda

Drive into the stage, they applaud and scream

Mouth my words, don't say shit
Shh, shut up bitch and ride this dick
I'm just playing, let's have a ball
All we need is some weed, hoes and alcohol, hey
Don't forget it when I'm wreckin' the etiquette for the hell of it
Smellin' it when the L is lit and I'm flyer than a pelican
Young fresh but I'm so damn intelligent
Girls givin' brains 'cause I'm acting like a gentleman

Have you ever been to heaven?
Have you ever seen the gates?
Have you bowed unto your highness?
And do you know how heaven taste? Knock me down

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Arm, leg, leg, arm, head – this is God body
Knowledge, wisdom, freedom, understanding, we just want our equality
Food, clothing, shelter, help a nigga find some peace
Happiness for a gangsta, ain't no love in these streets
Conspiracy theorist screaming Illuminati
They can't believe this much skill is in the human body
He's 6'2"", how the fuck he fit in a new Bugatti?
Aw, fuck it, you got me
Question religion, question it all
Question existence until them questions are solved
Meanwhile this heretic, I be out in Marrakesh
Morocco smoking hashish with my fellowship
Y'all dwell on devil shit, I'm in a Diablo
Yellow shit, color of Jell-O shit
Hello bitch, it's me again

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Getting ghost in the Ghost, can you see me? Can you see me?
Have mercy on a Judas, angel wings on a 'ghini
I'm secular, tell the hecklers seckle down
Y'all religion creates division like my Maybach partition
And God is my chauffeur, boy they love Hova
From the south side of Chi to Brooklyn where I growed up
I confess, God in the flesh
Live among the serpents, turn arenas into churches
I'm like Michael, recycle, these are not 16's
These are verses from the Bible
Tell that preacher he's a preacher, I'm a motherfuckin' prophet
Smoke a tree of knowledge, drink from a gold chalice
You gotta love it, I arrive at the pearly gates
I had luggage, meaning I had baggage
Niggas asking me questions, I don't answer to these busters
Only God could judge us, motherfuckers, uh

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Have you ever been to heaven?
Have you ever seen the gates?
Have you bowed unto your highness?
And do you know how heaven taste? Knock me down

A pair of Dutch chimps

I'd take it square on the chin
Well I found out fast a bullys just that and you got to stand up to him
So I didn't cry when I got a black eye as bad as it hurt I just grinned
But when tough little boys grow up to be Dads
They turn into big babies again
Scared me to death when took your first steps
Well I'd fall everytime you fell down
Your first day of school
I cried like a fool, I followed your school bus to town
Well I didn't cry when ol Yeller died
At least not in front of my friends
But when tough little boys grow up to be
Dads they turn into big babies again
Well I'm a grown man and as strong as I am
Well sometimes it's hard to believe
One little girl with little blonde curls can totally terrify me
If you were to ask my wife would just laugh
She'd say I know all about men
How tough little boys grow up to be Dads
They turn into big babies again
Well I know one day I'll give you away
And I'm goin to stand there and smile

You never gonna win that race
Put on a seatbelt and don't let her sit on your face
She might kill you in the morning at 2:14
Doin' the pussy pop like she from New Orleans
Its been a while more than 10 years past
When you close your eyes you can still see her ass
Her momma used to dance like that
Bouncin' that ass with her hands on her back
I saw her grandmomma do it with a baby in her arms
Put her hand on a car and started swingin' it hard
Every nigga at the party wanna get with the bitch

Do it like a dolphin on top of the water
Take it down to the ground and pop it harder
You been hangin' around them pimps again
Got ya gangsta walkin' like in Memphis, Tenn
Get it girl, I like the way you bounce
She must have learned that deep down way in the south
You from the west coast where you learned to do that dance
I'm about to stick my dick through the back of your pants
I wouldn't pass up a chance to grip your cheeks
Fall in that ass and keep me for a week
Now all that booty, is that for me
Its lookin' so fat, we at the party
Lets hit the bar and drink, Tequilla shots
Find a spot on the floor, lemme see it drop

When I freak, I'm gonna freak me a gangsta ...

[Verse 1 - R. Kelly]
I'm lookin for them gangsta girls
Not them fake ass +Wanksta+ girls
Just them ghetto fabulous girls, gotta keep 'em in my world
Mama makin gangsta moves, rollin with this gangsta dudes
Sittin on, spinnin 24's, openin my Bentley doors
Drunk at the party, hands up in the air but still she sexy when she shake her body
That type of chick that says ""hey girl, let's go to the after party""
After that we go to my room for the after, after party

At a gangsta party, she'll be drinkin Bacardi

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Mannie Fresh]
Once upon a time in this place called hood
Where the gangsta girls shake it and they all smell good
Lived this legendary pimp (pimp) by the name of Fresh
Fix hair, fix nails, fix toes, fix breast
But one chick super sick, make every nigga grab his dick
Heart pound up and down, when she goin round and round
Do the +Snake+, stop and shake, ass like an earthquake
I can't wait to meet her uh, undress her, beat her up
Now we leavin from the club, and she let me cop a rub
Can't believe she choose me, +Feelin On Her Booty+
I'm about to cut like knives, strokin mami with some ice
Takin me to paradise, I nut once, she nut twice
Sex in cities, rubbin titties, that's how I get it
One more 'gain, with her friend, playa that's how I hit it
Now we grippin, grabbin, pullin, stabbin (what is your name?)
It's Hypnotiq how I got it, but I'ma glad that you came

95,I Can't Take You Anywhere,"[Verse 1]
You've been a part of my life for so very long
It's hard for me to believe sometimes that you're really gone
I tuck your memory away in that special hiding place
Hoping no one could tell by the look on my face
That you're still in my heart, always on my mind
Part of my everyday

[Verse 2]
Like just last night I went out for a bite
I tried to have fun with all of my might
But even the laughter, it wasn't much of a break
'Cause right in the middle of my salad and steak
Bobby Joe walked in with a couple of friends
And said, ""Hey have you heard from her at all man like
Where's she been?""

[Chorus]
And it, struck a nerve
And it, hit a vein
You'd think from all the tears I cried
And this broken-hearted pain
I wouldn't have to carry you around with me
But it seems like everywhere I go
Somebody wants to know where you've been
Are you coming back again, I swear
I can't take you anywhere

[Verse 3]
So I left all alone, just headed back home
As I listened to the messages on my telephone
There was one from my sister
And one from an old friend
He said, ""I drove by your house tonight dude but
You weren't in
Just checking up on you boy, I hope you're doing alright
Oh by the way man, I seen her last night

[Chorus]
And it, hit a vein
You'd think from all the tears I cried
And this broken-hearted pain
I wouldn't have to carry you around with me
But it seems like everywhere I go
Somebody wants to know where you've been
Are you coming back again, I swear
I can't take you anywhere

[Outro]

Just can't take you

If you're over me, I'm already over you
If it's all been done, what is left to do?
How can you hang up if the line is dead?
If you wanna walk, I'm a step ahead
If you're moving on, I'm already gone
If the light is off, then it isn't on

All you hoes calling here for my daddy, get off his dick
Like that, mommy?
*Beep*
Hi, daddy, how you doing? This is Tyiest
I was thinking about you last night, mm
You actin' like you can't call me no more 'cause you busy and all of that
But you trying to tell me it wasn't good?
*Beep*
That shit is real fucked up what you did
I hooked you up with my girl and shit
You fucked her every time you see her
You don't even say shit to her, you know what I'm saying?
And all that bitch do is call me all day talking about you
""Why the fuck B.I.G. don't want me?""
*Beep*
Yo, B.I.G., this is Quita
Kenya told me she saw you and Shanie at the mall and I know you ain't fucking her
You fucked with me last night
That's my best friend and we don't get down like that
*Beep*
Yeah, motherfucker, this is Stephanie
I was waiting outside for your ass for like a fucking hour
I don't know what's going on, motherfuckers trying to rob me
You be disappearing and shit, I'm waiting in the cold
What the fuck is going on?
When you get in give me a fucking call, alright?

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
When it comes to sex, I'm similar to the Thrilla in Manila
Honeys call me ""Bigga the Condom Filler""
Whether it's stiff tongue or stiff dick
Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit, now check this shit
I got the pack of Rough Riders in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the epilogue by James Todd Smith
I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with a dick, make your kidney shift
Here we go, here we go, but I'm not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I wear thirteens, know what I mean?
I'll fuck around and hit you with the Hennessy dick
Mess around and go blind, don't get to see shit (See shit)
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder
It doesn't matter, skinny or fat or light-skinned or black
Baby, I drop these Boricua mamis screaming ¡Ay papi!
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
I only smoke blunts if they rolled proper
Look, I gotcha caught up with the drunk flow
Fuck tae kwon do, I tote a four-four
For niggas getting mad 'cause they bitch chose me
A big black motherfucker with G, you see
All I do is separate the game from the truth
Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Getting physical like Olivia Newt
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia
So give me a ho, a bankroll and a bag of weed
I'm guaranteed to fuck her 'til her nose bleed
Even if your new man's a certified mack
You'll get that H-Town in ya, you want that old thing back

[Chorus: Total & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
I got that good dick, girl, you didn't know?
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
I got that good dick, girl, you didn't know?
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
I got that good dick, girl, you didn't know?
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Is my mind playing tricks, like Scarface and Bushwick
Willie D, having nightmares of girls killing me?
She mad because what we had didn't last
I'm glad because her cousin let me hit the ass
Fuck the past, let's dwell on the 500SL, the E&J and ginger ale
The way my pockets swell to the rims with Benjamins
Another honey's in the crib? Please, send her in
I fuck non-stop, lick my lips a lot
Used to lick the clits a lot, but licking clits had to stop
'Cause y'all don't know how to act when the tongue go down below
Peep the funk flow
Really, though, I got the cleanest, meanest penis
You never seen this stroke of genius
So take off your Timb boots and your body suit
I mean the spandex and hit my man next
Sex get rougher when it come to the nut buster
Pussy crusher, black nasty motherfucker
I don't chase 'em, I replace 'em
And if I'm caressing 'em I'm undressing 'em
Fuck what you heard, who's the best in New York?
Fulfilling fantasies without that nigga Mr. Roarke
Or Tattoo, I got you wrapped around my dick
And when I nut I got to split
Shit, backshots is my position
I got you wishing for an intermission, fuck the kissin'
Lickin' you down to your belly button, I ain't frontin'
They don't call me big for nuttin' all of a sudden

So show me the money, like my name is Cuba Gooding
It ain't fools gold, its gold, fool
Can't stop won't stop keeping it old school, so cool
Big Spoon is my nom de plume
I keep it popping like a needle in a new balloon
And if you don't know by now then you need more schoolin'
Let loose kid, get stupid
Got more flavor than I know what to do with

All eyes on your boy, and I'm post side
Wait until you're outside, it's a more live-r
Let me open up like this a boy-knocker
Show you how I lay it down boy, so proper
No scholar but much class
I'm jump felt under your nose like a mustache, my pet splash
Equivalent of a benzo, M-Class
So fly my wardrobe, call me jet lag
Cash my dough cause my hook says fresh crack
So dope, I'm a certified meth lab
Pet nab has been that it got been fresh

Something big like wallets, you pocket change
All about presidents no politician
But every big face need your running mate

I never let up so hold on to your butts
And Imma wake you up, show you how it's done
I'll kick your swagger in the athletic cup, son

102,This One's For The Girls,"[Verse 1]
This one's for all you girls about 13
High school can be so rough, can be so mean
Hold onto, on to your innocence
Stand your ground when everyone's giving in

This one's for the girls
This is for all you girls about 25
In a little apartment, just trying to get by
Living on, on dreams and Spaghetti-O's
Wondering where your life is gonna go

[Chorus]
This one's for the girls
Who've ever had a broken heart
Who've wished upon a shooting star
You're beautiful the way you are

This one's for the girls
Who love without holding back
Who dream with everything they have
All around the world
This one's for the girls

[Verse 2]
This is for all you girls about 42
Tossing pennies into the Fountain of Youth
Every laugh, laugh line on your face
Made you who you are today

[Chorus]
This one's for the girls
Who've ever had a broken heart
Who've wished upon a shooting star
You're beautiful the way you are

[Bridge]
Yeah, we're all the same inside

103,Can't Hold Us Down,"[Intro: Christina Aguilera]
Hmmm

[Verse 1: Christina Aguilera]
So, what am I not 'sposed to have an opinion?
Should I keep quiet just because I'm a woman?
Call me a bitch 'cause I speak what's on my mind
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled
When a female fires back
Suddenly big talker don't know how to act
So he does what any little boy would do
Makin' up a few false rumors or two
That for sure is not a man to me
Slanderin' names for popularity
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy (It's so sad)
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say

[Chorus: Christina Aguilera]
This is for my girls all around the world (Around the world)
Who've come across a man that don't respect your worth (Whoa)
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard (Whoa)
So what do we do girls? Shout louder
Lettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground (Stand our ground)
Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud (Whoa)
Take a deep breath and say it loud (Whoa)
Never can, never will, can't hold us down

[Post-Chorus: Christina Aguilera]
Nobody can hold us down (Hold us down)
Nobody can hold us down (Hold us down)
Nobody gonna hold us down (Hold us down)
Never can, never will

[Verse 2: Christina Aguilera]
So, what am I not 'sposed to say what I'm sayin'?
Are you offended with the message I'm bringin'?
Call me whatever 'cause your words don't mean a thing
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing
If you look back in history
It's a common double standard of society
The guy gets all the glory, the more he can score
While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore
I don't understand why it's OK
The guy can get away with it, the girl gets named
All my ladies come together and make a change
And start a new beginning for us, everybody sing

[Chorus: Christina Aguilera & (Lil' Kim)]
This is for my girls all around the world (Around the world) (Yeah)
Who've come across a man that don't respect your worth (Respect your worth)
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard
(You can't get rid of us)
So what do we do girls? Shout louder
Lettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground
(We standin' our ground on this one)
Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud (Whoa)
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down (Check it)

[Verse 3: Lil' Kim]
Here's something I just can't understand
If a guy have three girls then he's the man
He can even give her some head, then sex her raw
If a girl do the same, then she's a whore
But the tables 'bout to turn, I bet my fame on it
Cats take my ideas and put they name on it
It's aiight though, you can't hold me down
I got to keep on movin'
To all my girls with a man who be tryna mack
Do it right back to him and let that be that
You need to let him know that his game is whack
And Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera gotcha back

[Bridge: Christina Aguilera]
You're just a little boy, you think you're so cute, so coy
You must talk so big, to make up for smaller things
Said you're just a little boy, all you do is annoy
You must talk so big, to make up for smaller things
This is for my girls

[Chorus: Christina Aguilera]
This is for my girls all around the world, oh
Who've come across a man that don't respect your worth
(Respect your worth, oh)
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard
So what do we do girls? Shout louder (Shout louder)
Lettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground (Stand our ground)
Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud (Whoa)
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will, can't hold us down (Whoa)
This is for my girls all around the world (All my girls)
Who've come across a man that don't respect your worth (Around the world)
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard (Yeah)

Through a window or an open door

Come rescue me
I need you right away

I need you now [x4]
Not another second or another minute
Not an hour of another day but, Lord
I need you right away

If I never needed you before
To show up and restore all of the faith that I let slip
While I was yet searching the world for more, the truest friend I have indeed
You're my best friend I know in need
I stretch my hands to thee
Come rescue me
I need you right away

The agony of being alone
The fear of doing things on my own
The test and trials that come to make me strong
The feelings of guilt, hurt, shame, and defeat
The waves and trials that beat upon me
But to know, Lord, that in you I've got victory

I need you now, Lord
I need you now (ooooh)
I need you right now, right now, right now

I need a sign to let me know you're here
All of these lines are being crossed over the atmosphere
I need to know that things are gonna look up
'Cause I feel us drowning in a sea spilled from a cup
When there is no place safe
And no safe place to put my head
When you feel the world shake
From the words that are said

[Chorus]
And I'm calling all angels
And I'm calling all you angels
I won't give up if you don't give up
I won't give up if you don't give up
I won't give up if you don't give up
I won't give up if you don't give up

I need a sign to let me know you're here

I need a hand to help build up
Some kind of hope inside of me

And I'm calling all angels
And I'm calling all you angels

[Bridge]
When children have to play inside
So they don't disappear
While private eyes solve marriage lies

And football teams are kissing queens
And losing sight of having dreams
In a world that what we want
Is only what we want until it's ours

Damn, girl you got me fucked up

Why we still conversatin' about my ex
Girl I'm bouta block your ass cause you keep calling it’s fucking up my GPS
We keep saying shit gon be alright, but

Still tryna comprehend how we manage to argue, fuck all in the same night

But you say fuck that you want my time
My time tight but my bag right so it's like I try to compromise
Ain't with talking but you know what's up

But at the same time the other part of me wanna cave in and hit you up
That's why I'm so worried about this hoe
I worry bout not one of these hoes
Why you still calling if you ain't let me talk, leave me the fuck alone
First it's fuck me, then it's fuck you then you love me and I love you you worried bout these hoes and what lust do you can't trust me I can't trust you
There was a spark and now I'm like fuck it
I promise it's always something

115,Where Is The Love?,"[Verse 1: will.i.am]
What's wrong with the world, mama?
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to the things that'll bring a trauma
Overseas, yeah, we tryin' to stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and the Crips, and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love, this'll set us straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
These people got me, got me questionin'

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake (and Fergie)]
Where is the love? (love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love, the love)

[Verse 2: Taboo]
It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gases fillin' lungs of little ones
With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?
So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong?
With this world that we livin' in, people keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
If you never know truth, then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all? (Come on, I don't know)
Where's the truth, y'all? (Come on, I don't know)
And where's the love y'all?

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Will you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
These people got me, got me questionin'

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake (and Fergie)]
Where is the love? (love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love, the love)

[Verse 3: Apl.de.ap]
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm getting older, y'all people gets colder
Most of us only care about money-makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
Whatever happened to the values of humanity?
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality?
Instead of spreadin' love we spreadin' animosity
Lack of understandin' leading us away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found
Now ask yourself…

[Bridge: will.i.am & Justin Timberlake]
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?

Let's play a game
I'll show you how it's done
Here in the Garden
Stand very still
This'll be so much fun

And then she smiled
That's what I'm after
A smile in her eyes
The sound of her laughter
Happy to listen
Happy to play
Happily watching her drift away

Happily waiting
All on my own
Under the endless sky
Counting the seconds
Standing alone
As thousands of years go by

Happily wondering
Night after night
Is this how it works?
Am I doing it right?
Happy to listen
Happy to stay
Happily watching her drift away

You keep on turning pages for people who don't care
People who don't care about you
And still, it takes you ages to see that no one's there
See that no one's there
See that no one's there
Everyone's gone on without you

Finally something
Finally news
About how the story ends
She doesn't exist now
Survived by her son
And all of her brand new friends
Isn't that lovely?
Isn't that cool?
And isn't that cruel
And aren't I a fool to have
Happily listened
Happy to stay
Happily watching her drift

Geah! History in the making
Part two!
It's so crazy right now

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I look and stare so deep in your eyes (I...)
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave, I'm begging you not to go
Call your name, two, three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling, and my pride is the one to blame (Yeah)
'Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
When I talk to my friends so quietly
(""Who he think he is?"") Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Jay-Z]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now

Young Hov, y'all know when the flow is loco
Young B and the R-O-C, uh-oh (Oh)
O.G. Big Homie, the one and only (Oh, no)
Stick bony, but the pockets is fat like Tony (Oh, no)
Soprano, the ROC handle like Van Exel
I shake phonies man you can't get next to
The genuine article, I do not sing though
I sling though, if anything, I bling yo
A star like Ringo, war like a Green Beret
You crazy? Bring ya whole set
JAY-Z in the Range, crazy and deranged
They can't figure him out, they like, ""Hey, is he insane?"" (Oh, no)
Yes sir, I'm cut from a different cloth
My texture is the best fur: chinchilla
I've been iller than chain smokers
How you think I got the name Hova?
I been realer, the game's over
Fall back, Young
Ever since I made the change over to platinum
The game's been a wrap, one

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
Got me looking, so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself lately, I'm foolish, I don't do this
I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care
'Cause your love's got the best of me
And baby you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
'Cause baby you got me, you got me
You got me, you got me so crazy, baby
Hey!

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now

123,Real Good Man,"[Verse 1]
Girl you've never known no one like me
Up there in your high society
They might tell you I'm no good
Girl they need to understand
Just who I am
I may be a real bad boy
But baby I'm a real good man

[Verse 2]
I may drink too much and play too loud
Hang out with a rough and rowdy crowd
That don't mean I don't respect
My Mama or my Uncle Sam
Yes sir, yes ma'am
I may be a real bad boy
But baby I'm a real good man

[Verse 3]
I might have a reckless streak
At least a country-mile wide
If you're gonna run with me
It's gonna be a wild ride
When it comes to loving you
I've got velvet hands
I'll show you how a real bad boy
Can be a real good man

[Verse 4]
I take all the good times I can get
I'm too young for growing up just yet
Ain't much I can promise you
'Sept to do the best I can

124,If I Can't,"[Chorus]
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

[Verse 1]
I'm in Toronto and I got this view
But I might as well be in a hotel room, yeah
It doesn't matter 'cause I'm so consumed
Spending all my nights reading texts from you

I know that you're the feeling I'm missing
You know that I hate to admit it
But everything means nothing if I can't have you

Is it too late to tell you that

I'm so sorry that my timing's off
But I can't move on if we're still gonna talk
Is it wrong for me to not want half?
I want all of you, all the strings attached

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm good at keeping my distance
I know that you're the feeling I'm missing
You know that I hate to admit it
But everything means nothing if I can't have you

125,The Boys Of Summer,"[Verse 1]
Nobody on the road
Nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air
The summer's out of reach
Empty lake, empty streets
The Sun goes down alone
I'm driving by your house
Though I know you're not home

[Chorus 1]
But I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the Sun
You got your hair combed back and your
Sunglasses on baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

[Verse 2]
I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy?
Remember how I made you scream?
Now I don't understand what happened to our love
But babe I'm gonna get you back
I'm going to show you what I'm made of

[Chorus 2]
I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the Sun
I see you walking real slow
Smiling at everyone
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

[Verse 3]
Out on the road today
I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said
“Don't look back, you can never look back”
I thought I knew what love was, what did I know?
Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go but...

[Chorus 3]
I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the Sun
You got the top pulled down
Radio on, baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the Sun
You got your hair slicked back and those
Wayfarers on, baby

Damn
There's a lot of bitches up in here tonight boy
I'm about to get drunk
Let's hold down
Where the bar at?

[Verse 1]
Okay, okie dokey Obie's here
No more Focus Hobo's got a career
And I like your brassiere and there's a party in here
And I'm ready to talk naughty in Veronica's ear
She erotic and it's hot, saw Heineken beer
Put it to the side and invite her to ""Cheers""
Pull up a chair, nigga swear no drama
Prepare for a player who's working with a monster
I ain't got time to waste, let's vacate the place
Shut blinds and drapes, grind to your face in a grimy state
Concentrate, you will find that your bound to get
But we found what's fate
We can watch two incredible mates masturbate
Why settle and wait
Let's escalate to the nearest Super 8
And see your rear is on the mirrors and they smearin' booty cheeks
C'mon

[Refrain]
And this is my favorite song
Now sing along when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth
And this is my favorite song
Now sing along when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth

[Verse 2]
Okay holy moly derriere
Look around the club booty everywhere
She caught me starin
And my homies darin me to approach Karen
She's model material, but she got a venereal
Tons of baby fathers', baby bottles and cereal
She holla cause I got a lot of dinerio
The DJ's playin Obie song on the stereo
And she's impaired and she wants to be headin home
With the real thing not the dildo clone
And I know I don't wanna be headin home
With some double Ds full of silicon
Ten hoodrat chicks surround me outside
Found me outside, clown me outside
'Til I pop the trunk and they found me outside
Cussin at the bitches screamin ""off to they rides!""

And this is my favorite song
Now sing along when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep

Okay rolie polies everywhere
Gotta find a slim chick's atmosphere
Obesity's glarin and she got me fearin
She's gonna come over here and try to eat me literally, like a box of Cheerios
Cherry cupcakes and chocolate Tootsie rolls
I'm outta order cause I gotta big girl disorder
So better cover up that blubber or I'll split
(feet running away noise)
And I ain't got time to play
Let's investigate another place today
Ladies less in weight and the dress they shape
Dresses pettite, no window drapes

133,The Remedy (I Won't Worry),"[Verse 1]
Well, I saw fireworks from the freeway
And behind closed eyes, I cannot make them go away
'Cause you were born on the fourth of July, freedom ring
Well, something on the surface, it stings
I said, something on the surface, well, it kinda makes me nervous who says that you deserve this?
And what kind of god would serve this?
We will cure this dirty old disease
Well, if you've gots the poison, I've gots the remedy

[Pre-Chorus]
The remedy is the experience
This is a dangerous liaison
I says, the comedy is that it's serious
Which is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
When it all amounts to nothing in the end

[Chorus]
I, I won't worry my life away
Hey, oh, oh
I, I won't worry my life away
Hey, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Well, I heard two men talking on the radio
In a cross fire kind of new reality show
Uncovering the ways to plan the next big attack
While they were counting down the days to stab the brother in the be right back after this
The unavoidable kiss, where the minty fresh death breath is sure to outlast his catastrophe
Dance with me, because if you've gots the poison, I've gots the remedy

[Pre-Chorus]
The remedy is the experience
This is a dangerous liaison
I says the comedy is that it's serious
Which is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
When it all amounts to nothing in the end

When I fall in love (I fall in love), I take my time
There's no need to hurry when I'm making up my mind
You can turn off the sun (Turn off the sun), but I'm still gonna shine and I'll tell you why

[Pre-Chorus]
Because the remedy is the experience
This is a dangerous liaison
I says the comedy is that it's serious
Which is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
When it all amounts to nothing in the end

134,It's Five O'Clock Somewhere,"[Verse 1: Alan Jackson]
The sun is hot and that old clock is movin' slow
An' so am I
Work day passes like molasses in wintertime
But it's July
I'm gettin' paid by the hour, an' older by the minute
My boss just pushed me over the limit
I'd like to call him somethin'
I think I'll just call it a day

[Chorus: Alan Jackson]
Pour me somethin' tall an' strong
Make it a ""Hurricane"" before I go insane
It's only half-past twelve but I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere

[Verse 2: Alan Jackson]
Oh, this lunch break is gonna take all afternoon
An' half the night
Tomorrow mornin', I know there'll be hell to pay
Hey, but that's all right
I ain't had a day off now in over a year
Our Jamaican vacation's gonna start right here
If the phone’s for me
You can tell 'em I just sailed away

[Chorus: Alan Jackson]
And pour me somethin' tall an' strong
Make it a ""Hurricane"" before I go insane
It's only half-past twelve but I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere

[Bridge: Alan Jackson, Jimmy Buffett, Both]
I could pay off my tab, pour myself in a cab
An' be back to work before two
At a moment like this, I can't help but wonder
What would Jimmy Buffett do?
Funny you should ask Alan I'd say
""Pour me somethin' tall an' strong
Make it a ""Hurricane"" before I go insane
It's only half-past twelve but I don't care""
Pour me somethin' tall an' strong
Make it a ""Hurricane"" before I go insane
It's only half-past twelve but I don't care
He don't care
I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere

[Outro: Alan Jackson & Jimmy Buffett]
What time zone am I on? What country am I in?
It doesn't matter, it's five o'clock somewhere

You been there haven't you
Yessir
I seen your boat there
I've been to Margaritaville a few times
All right, that's good
Stumbled all the way back

136,Dance With My Father,"Back when I was a child
Before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high
And dance with my mother and me
And then
Spin me around 'till I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me
And I knew for sure
I was loved

If I could get another chance
Another walk
Another dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
How I'd love love love
To dance with my father again

When I and my mother
Would disagree
To get my way I would run
From her to him
He'd make me laugh just to comfort me
Yeah yeah
Then finally make me do
Just what my mama said
Later that night when I was asleep
He left a dollar under my sheet
Never dreamed that he
Would be gone from me

If I could steal one final glance
One final step
One final dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
Cause I'd love love love to
Dance with my father again

Sometimes I'd listen outside her door
And I'd hear how mama would cry for him
I'd pray for her even more than me
I'd pray for her even more than me

I know I'm praying for much to much
But could you send her
The only man she loved
I know you don't do it usually
But Dear Lord
She's dying to dance with my father again

Paint a picture like a young Pablo, Picasso
Niggas say ""Live fast, die young,"" so I drive slow
And pray I die old
In the drop with the top low
Met a bad bitch from Chicago, my hat wasn't cocked, yo
Kept it straight, shit, cause y'all know
And if not, you'll learn how them niggas in the Chi go
I ain't fuck her, but I'm thinking 'bout it
My niggas say why you gotta think about it?
The bitch want too much, hit my phone too much
If I gotta be frank about it
Ain't worth the stress
First the text, then the draws, see first is sex
Then it's calls cause the bird's obsessed
Want flowers, cards, and the purses next
Nah, bitch can't get a dollar
Cole on Twitter, bitch can't get a follow
Can get a nut, heard ""Can't Get Enough""

And I'm going back to school

Everybody sweat her like Catholic school
Sat next to her in the back of the class
Cheated off her test and I'm grabbing her ass
She like ""Don't you know this shit already?""
""Nigga, ain't you rich already?""
Yeah, but I got dumb as shit
Hanging 'round these rappers 'cause they dumb as shit
But I'm back on track, jump shot wasn't that good
Couldn't sell crack but I rap good
That's one stereotype
Know a lot of niggas that'll marry your type
Bad bitch with a degree, I let 'em scoop ya
I'm Koopa, I never been the Mario type

I ain't fooled cause a lot of cool bitches that a nigga went to school with is major hoes
And they mans don't know, they mans don't know, fo' sho

Pull up at your apartment sitting on 20 somethings
And the dope boys hollering ""What's happening?"" kid running in

And the cars been parked but the rims keep moving
Sign pictures, buy an onion of good and throw the deuces

I'm calling out shots like a pool shark
My tools spark in the dark when I fool marks
Y'all fools hearts in the wrong place at the wrong time, I got a strong mind
To grab my chrome nine and shoot at your ass for a long time
But I'mma get that ass hauled off, fuck around with the clique

I'd probably still be trapping if I wasn't rapping right now
Bragging about pistols at the house, guess who's strapped right now
Keep on talking folk, I'll lay you on your back right now
Want to act right now, get smacked right now
I'm a buck mothafucka, I don't know how to back down
Clown down here fakin', frontin', talking ‘bout what you making: nothin’
I'm 21 and 10 years deep, that shit to me ain't nothing

Lose your leg when I spray, end up dead from the K

140,What Was I Thinkin',"[Verse 1]
Becky was a beauty from south Alabama
Her daddy had a heart like a nine-pound hammer
Think he even did a little time in the slammer
What was I thinking?
She snuck out one night and met me by the front gate
Her daddy came out waving that twelve gauge
We tore out the drive he peppered my tailgate
What was I thinking?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late
Cause I was

[Chorus]
Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where a night might lead
I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinking... what was I thinking

[Verse 2]
By the county line the cops were nipping on our heels
Pulled off the road and kicked it in four-wheel
Shut off the lights and tore through the corn field
What was I thinking?
Out the other side she was hollering faster
Took a dirt road and had the radio blasting
Hit the honky tonk for a little close dancing
What was I thinking?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late
Cause I was

But what was I thinking... what was I thinking

[Verse 3]
When a mountain of a man with a ""born to kill"" tattoo
Tried to cut in I knocked out his front tooth
We ran outside hood-sliding like Bo Duke
What was I thinking?
I finally got her home at a half past too late
Her daddy's in a lawn chair sitting on the driveway
Put it in park as he started my way
What was I thinking, oh what was I thinking
Then she gave a come-and-get-me grin
And like a bullet we were gone again... cause I was

The moment was custom-made to order
I was riding with my daughter on our way back from Monroe
And like children do
She started playing twenty questions
But I never could of guessed one would touch me to my soul

She said
Daddy, when we get to Heaven
Can I taste the Milky Way?
Are we going there to visit
Or are we going there to stay?

Am I gonna see my Grandpa?
Can I have a pair of wings?
And do you think that God could use another angel
To help pour out the rain?

Well, I won't lie
I pulled that car right over
And I sat there on the shoulder
Trying to dry my misty eyes

And I whispered
Lord, I wanna thank you for my children
Cause your innocence that fills them
Often takes me by surprise like

Well, I thought about it later on
And a smile came to my face
And when I tucked her in to bed
I got down on my knees and prayed

[Chorus:]
Lord, when I get to Heaven
Can I taste the Milky Way?
I don't wanna come to visit
Cause I'm coming home to stay?

And I can't wait to see my family
And meet Jesus face to face
And do you think, Lord
You could use another angel
To help pour out the rain?

Hole in the world
Marble corridors and angels
I've been looking for Your Holy Face
Through a window draped in lace
A vision of amazing grace

Dove coming down from the sky
An itch in the feet, and a helpless hunger
Inside, outside

Hole in the world
Here every tongue cries ""Christ is risen""
Hole in the world
I see old enemies embracing
Moonlight falling on the blistered glass
Someone whispers, ""Here at last""
That's when I saw Your shadow pass

A bump in the night, then an open border
Bus ride over the moon
A swim upstream in the living water

145,A Few Questions,"How in this world
Can we put a man on the moon
And still have a need
For a place like St. Judes
And why is one man born
In a place where all they know is war
A guy like me
Has always been free

And how can two people
Who built a loving home
Try for years
And never have a child of their own
And somewhere out there tonight
There is a baby no ones holding tight
In need of love
To me that don't add up

But I wasn't there the day you filled up the ocean
I didn't get to see you hang the stars in the sky
So I don't mean to second guess you
Or criticize what I don't understand
These are just a few questions I have

And why did my cousin
Have to die in that crash
A good kid
Only seventeen
I still wonder 'bout that
It seems unfair to me
Some get the chance to chase their dreams
And some don't
What do I know

I wasn't there the day You filled up the ocean
I didn't get to see You hang the stars in the sky
So I don't mean to second guess You
Or criticize what I don't understand
These are just a few questions I have

Why do I feel like
You hear these prayers of mine
When so many outta be
Ahead of me in line
When you look down on me

I am in love with the lights, the love, the rights, the wrongs

The life, the love, the rights, the wrong
They told me that it wouldn't be night for long!

[Verse 1]
And I'm in love with the lights, the love
Celebrity hoes, Hollywood parties that never get old
Table full of new hoes, champagne nuvo
My mind is on Venus, but my neck is on Pluto
I need a girl that look badder than my girlfriend
You know the ones that look badder than their girlfriends
Paparazzi try to pop Big since I'm in Cali
But I just hide my face doing a Errol Flynns
Hoody over my head, Jedi, Anakin
Looking like a BBC Louis V mannequin
She ain't got no man in em
She got no companion, she's Jenifer Aniston
I'm trying to hit her, and her friend
And again, and again
Pass it to my mans and them
Fucking all the baddest bitches in cities we're landing in!

[Verse 2]
I'm in love with the money..
They say that it's the root of all evil
At least that's what the pastor tried to teach us
But he will pass around that collection plate
Til it's heavyweight as soon as his speech through
Then hop in that Benz coupe
Shit, I'm trying to get Benz too!
But how is it the root of all evil?
If it could take my whole family out to Rio?
No more repo
A depo, just speed boats
Jewelry all gold call me C3PO
Smoke so much, I gotta see 3PO
Cause I'm worldwide tour with me and my nigga Zeno
Most comfortable behind the mics like T.O
So I hate to lose my Mike like Tito

I do it for, everything in life for love and meaning
I hope they never try to tell me I'm leaving
Getting everything I want, then I've got my mom next
LA Reid sign checks right after the contract

Just to know who you are?

Can you take your mind off the silly things
Keep your eye on the ball?

But you ain’t gotta worry
'Bout nobody comin round here
Getting none of this, or takin’ your spot

On my timeline, seeing who is new
Don’t worry about who follows who

But baby I want you

All I wanna do is be around you
Don’t you worry ‘bout the old
Cause we’re on to the new
Ain’t studdin’ them, ‘cause I’m thinkin’ ‘bout you
Know that nothing can come between
What we have and what we do
So for the times that I’m gone
Know that this much is true
Baby you are not alone
So I’m asking you

What we tryna say?
What we tryna prove?

As long as the homie sing a song or two

That summer I turned a corner in my soul
Down that red dirt road

Where I wrecked my first car

With my shackled up GTO

Throw rocks at her bedroom window

Drive by the moonlight

Man, cats don't know what it's gonna be
Fuckin' with a nigga like me

Last I heard, y'all niggas was havin' sex with the same sex

Empty out, reload and throw mo' slugs
How you gonna explain fuckin' a man?
Even if we squash the beef, I ain't touchin' your hand
I don't fuck with chumps
For those who been to jail, that's the cat with the Kool-Aid on his lips and pumps
I don't fuck with niggas that think they broads
Only know how to be one way, that's the dog
I know how to get down, know how to bite
Bark very little, but I know how to fight
I know how to chase a cat up in the tree
Man, I give y'all niggas the bidness for fuckin' with me
Is you crazy?!

Once it's on, I come through, guns is drawn
Blam blam, lungs are gone, sons will mourn
From dusk till dawn, nighttime belongs to the dog
On the street past midnight, look for 'em in the morgue
Don't play with these cats
'Cause I ain't got nothin' to say to these cats
For the mothers that really do love 'em, please pray for these cats
'Cause I know niggas is hard-headed but I ain't got the patience
Don't want me havin' no patience turn into more patients
More trips to ICU 'cause I see you
Tryna get away with shit a real nigga wouldn't do
Where my dogs at? (Right here!)
See them niggas? (Right where?!)
Get 'em boy! (Right there!)
That's how we do (Alright then!)

I get tapes doin' times, stomp niggas like grapes makin' wine
Five CD's with mad rhymes
Don't hit me with that positive shit, I know you lyin'
You really wanna stop niggas from dyin'? Stop niggas from tryin'
'Cause I ain't really got that time to waste
And I thought I told you to get these fuckin' bums out my face
Lookin' at you in your grill, I might be nice to cut
Once I split your ass in two, you'll be twice as butt
Yeah, you right, I know your style: pussy, 'cause I'm fuckin' it
Since we all right here, you hold my dick while he suckin' it
Motherfucker, don't you know you'll never come near me?
Shove your head up your ass, have you seein' shit clearly
Never heard that D be runnin', because D be gunnin'
I beat my dick and bust off in your eye so you can see me comin'
Empty clips and shells are what I leave behind
And if they get me with the joint, they hit me with a three-to-nine

164,This Is The Night,"I'm scared of the things I think of
When night comes along
Something gets hold of me
Something I can't see

Oh, it's a wicked world
Awaits the ones our young girls bear
Oh, I need somebody to hold me
In the fading light of this coming night
In the fading light of this coming night

How many whores have walked through that door
Lain by my side and climbed in my mind
And taken me down to where the heat
Blisters the skin upon my feet
Makes me reach out and weep for the days when
I was pure of heart and slept in peace

Oh, it's a wicked world
Awaits the ones our young girls bear
Oh, I need somebody to hold me

165,Then They Do,"[Verse 1]
In the early rush of morning
Trying to get the kids to school
One's hanging on my shirt-tail
Another's locked up in her room
And I'm yelling up the stairs
""Stop worrying about your hair, you look fine""
Then they're fighting in the backseat
And I'm playing referee
Now someone's got to go
The moment that we leave
And everybody's late
I swear that I can't wait until they grow up

[Chorus]
Then they do, and that's how it is
It's just quiet in the morning
Can't believe how much you miss
All they do and all they did
You want all the dreams they dreamed of to come true
Then they do

[Verse 2]
Now the youngest is starting college
She'll be leaving in the Fall
And Brianna's latest boyfriend
Called to ask if we could talk
And I got the impression
That he's about to pop the question any day
I look over at their pictures
Sitting in their frames
I see them as babies
I guess that'll never change
You pray all their lives
That someday they will find happiness

[Chorus]

No more Monday PTA's
No carpools, or soccer games
Your work is done
Now you've got time that's all your own

Grab the pistol put it to his head, it's to depression

Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart and you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
""Daddy, look what I made!"" ""Dad's gotta go catch a plane""
""Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?""
""I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writin' a song, this song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself""
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice

I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice

""Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more"" ""Daddy, you're lyin'!
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leavin' no more, Daddy, you're mine!""
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door, tryna block it
""Daddy, please! Daddy, don't leave! Daddy, no, stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it with ya!""
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man, I can hear 'em
They're sayin', ""You got one more chance to do right and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late!""
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and this spotlight is on and I'm singin'

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

[Verse 3]
Sixty-thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow, and thank you all for comin' out
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
""Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!""
But baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
""I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin
I get the point, fine, me and Mommy are goin'.""
But baby, wait! – ""It's too late, Dad, you made the choice
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep
Screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah, I bet you you will
You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real.""
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream, ""Die, Shady!"" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was
Supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles, and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing

182,My Front Porch Looking In,"[Intro]
Ooh, yeah
Woo, yeah
Yeah oh yeah

[Verse 1]
The only ground I ever owned was stickin' to my shoes
Now I look at my front porch at this panoramic view
I can sit and watch the fields fill up with rays of golden sun
Or watch the moon lay on the fences like that's where it was hung

[Pre-Chorus]
My blessings aren't in front of me
It's not about the land
I'll never beat the view
Of my front porch looking in

[Chorus]
There's a carrot top who can barely walk
With a sippy cup of milk
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong
'Cause she likes to dress herself
And the most beautiful girl
Holding both of them
Yeah, the view I love the most
Is my front porch looking in

[Verse 2]
I've traveled here and everywhere following my job
I've seen the paintings from the air brushed by the hand of God
The mountains and the canyons reach from sea to shining sea
But I can't wait to get back home to the one He made for me

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause anywhere I'll ever go
And everywhere I've been
Nothing takes my breath away
Like my front porch looking in

There's a carrot top who can barely walk

When I'm looking in

Grand pappy told my pappy, back in my day, son
A man had to answer for the wicked that he done
Take all the rope in Texas
Find a tall oak tree, round up all of them bad boys
Hang them high in the street for all the people to see that

[Chorus]
Justice is the one thing you should always find
You got to saddle up your boys
You got to draw a hard line

We got too many gangsters doing dirty deeds
We’ve got too much corruption, too much crime in the streets

And you're out, hanging with your friends
So you say, somehow I know its not quite that way
It's getting pretty late, and you haven't checked on me all day
When I called, you didn't answer
Now I'm feeling like you're ignoring me
I wish,that you were home, holding me tight in your arms
I wish,I could go back, to the day before we met and skip my regret

[Chorus]
I wish I wasn't in love with you
So you couldn't hurt me
It just ain't fair the way you treat me
No you don't deserve me
Wasted my time thinking bout you and you ain't never gone change
I wish I wasn't in love with you so I wouldn't feel this way

[Verse 2]
When you touch me my heart melts
And everything you did wrong I forget
So you play me and take advantage of the love that I feel for you
Why you wanna hurt me so bad
I believed in you that's why I'm so mad
Now I'm drowning in disappointment, and it's hard for me to even look at you
I wish, that you were home, holding me tight in your arms. Oooh baby
I wish, I could go back
To the day before we met and skip my regret

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Said you care about me, but from what I see
I ain't feeling all that, so I disagree
Gave you all my love and understanding
Yet you treated me like your enemy
So leave me alone, don't want nothin' from you
Just go back where you came from
This house is no longer your home
You're not welcome no, no, no,more

She only smokes when she drinks
She only drinks now and then
Now and then when she's tired
Of being let down by men
You can give her a light
But it's not what you think
Everybody knows she only drinks alone
And she only smokes when she drinks

Did you ask her to dance?
Let me guess, she told you no
Got to take her someplace quiet
And see how far that goes
Oh, don't take it all that hard
When she smiles and turns you down
For a complicated girl
She ain't that hard to figure out

She only smokes when she drinks
She only drinks now and then
Now and then when she's tired

You can give her a light
But it's not what you think
Everybody knows she only drinks alone
And she only smokes when she drinks

To know that I can say I love you

You are now rockin'
With 50 Cent
You gotta love it

[Intro: 50 Cent]
I just wanna chill and twist the lye
Catch stunts in my 7-45
You drive me crazy, shorty, I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need, and I
Like your smile, I don't want to see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask
And I hope you can come up with the answers, babe

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
If I fell off tomorrow, would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good, would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hooptie from a Benz
Would you poof and disappear like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt, would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work, would you be down to ride?
I get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive
I'm askin' questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap ‘cause I flip burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you're feelin' me?
In the bed, if I used my tongue, would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter, would you write back?
Now we can have a little drink, you know, a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that

Girl, it's easy to love me now

Now would you leave me if your father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm lovin'?
Are you mad ‘cause I'm askin' you 21 questions?
Are you my soulmate? ‘Cause if so, girl, you a blessing
Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?
I'm starin' at you, tryna figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down, would you say things to make me smile?
I'll treat you how you want to be treated, just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me? or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans, girl, we make mistakes
To make it up, I'll do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style, I say anything to make you smile

[Verse 4: Rah Digga]
We started out broke
Constantly on a roll
Cuttin' up in the streets like we would never get old
Went from looseys and buses to fifty cent sodas
And Novas to Hondas to Lexus to Rovers
Mad years passed
Still got each other back (oh yeah)
Word is bond never screw none of these industry cats (boy)
We like Scull and Mulder
Walkin' shoulder to shoulder
Milkin' this game watchin' our seeds gettin' older

If you are not mine, then why does your heart return my call?
If you are not mine, would I have the strength to stand at all?

If I don't need you, then why am I crying on my bed?
If I don't need you, then why does your name resound in my head?

I've always been the quiet type 'till now

I never let anybody know just how
Much I was so deep in love
But now that you're in my arms

I'm gonna stand on a rooftop
Climb up a mountaintop
Baby, scream and shout
I wanna sing it on the radio
Show it on a video
Baby, leave no doubt
I want the whole world to know (World to know)
Just what I'm all about
I love to love you out loud

[Verse 2]
You keep bringing out the free in me
What you do to my heart just makes me melt

But I've never been one to kiss and tell

So I'm gonna let out a yell

206,Three Wooden Crosses,"[Verse 1]
A farmer and a teacher, a hooker and a preacher
Riding on a midnight bus bound for Mexico
One was headed for vacation, one for higher education
And two of them were searching for lost souls
That driver never ever saw the stop sign
And eighteen wheelers can't stop on a dime

[Chorus]
There are three wooden crosses
On the right side of the highway
Why there's not four of them, heaven only knows
I guess it's not what you take
When you leave this world behind you
It's what you leave behind you when you go

[Verse 2]
That farmer left a harvest, a home and eighty acres
The faith and love for growing things in his young son's heart
And that teacher left her wisdom
In the minds of lots of children:
Did her best to give 'em all a better start
And that preacher whispered:
""Can't you see the Promised Land?""
As he laid his blood-stained bible
In that hooker's hand

[Chorus]
There are three wooden crosses
On the right side of the highway
Why there's not four of them, heaven only knows
I guess it's not what you take
When you leave this world behind you
It's what you leave behind you when you go

[Bridge]
That's the story that our preacher told last Sunday
As he held that blood-stained bible up
For all of us to see
He said: ""Bless the farmer, and the teacher, an' the preacher;
Who gave this Bible to my mamma
Who read it to me.""

[Chorus]
There are three wooden crosses
On the right side of the highway
Why there's not four of them, now I guess we know
It's not what you take when you leave this world behind you
It's what you leave behind you when you go

Kill 'em all, then hit the rendezvous
Killing these beats like Kanye do

Hit another level when your ass got famous""
Now they taking shots at the boy but it's aimless
That purple micro, red dot, I'm high and I'm killin' shit
Since 2009, feelin' fine, yeah, I'm still in it
Changin' with the times when I rhyme, people feelin' it like braille
They say, ""Logic different now,"" and I be like, ""Oh well""
I'm rich, I'm healthy, I'm happy, and I'm wealthy
Money like my last name Banks
Bitch, you Geoffrey, bitch, you Geoffrey, like shit
You salty, uh, I said you salty 'cause you sluggish
I made it 'cause I'm me, ain't switch the image like I'm thuggish

210,What Would You Do?,"[Verse 1]
Boys and girls wanna hear a true story?
Saturday night I was at this real wild party
They had the liquor overflowing the cup
About 5 or 6 strippers tryin to work for a buck
And I took one girl outside with me
Her name was Lonni, she went to junior high with me
I said, ""Why you up in there dancin' for cash?
I guess a whole a lot's changed since I seen you last.""
She said

[Refrain]
What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
Cause he's hungry
And the only way to feed him is to, sleep with a man for a little bit of money
And his daddy's gone
Somewhere smokin' rock now, in and out of lockdown
I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time, but for me this is what I call life

[Verse 2]
Girl you ain't the only one with a baby
That's no excuse to be living all crazy
Then she looked me right square in the eye
And said every day I wake up hopin' to die
She said-nigga I know about pain cause
Me and my sister ran away so my daddy couldn't rape us
Before I was a teenager
I been through more shit that you can't even relate to

[Refrain]
What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
Cause he's hungry
And the only way to feed him is to, sleep with a man for a little bit of money
And his daddy's gone
Somewhere smokin' rock now, in and out of lockdown
I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time, but for me this is what I call life

Yo way hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, stop the breakin' yo
Stop the breakin'
You should you ain't gonna be going out
Like this men

[Bridge]
Hold up!
What would you do?
Get up on my feet and let go of every excuse
What would you do?
Cause I wouldn't want my baby to go through what I went through
Come on, what would you do?
Get up on my feet and stop making tired excuses
What would you do?
Girl, I know if my mother can do it, baby you can do it

[Refrain]
What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor

You wanna get paid more than the first of the month

That'll take you to the store, tell her ""Pick what you want""
So uh, go ahead and act up, Imma throw this stack up
I'm always holdin' down the Bay, that's where I get my mack from
When I hit it Imma kill it, that's fatal attraction
She want a G up in her unit like I'm Curtis Jackson
And I'll teach you how to stunt
Rich city nigga, diamonds in my gold fronts
I'm lookin' at her once and then she rollin' up a blunt
She say she comin' to the Bay and she ain't comin' home for months
Now she goin' dumb
And she know she got a goal every time she come
She wanna turn into a bro, I'ma make her one

Uh, Uh, Uh
Baby girl
You know my situation
And sometimes I know you get impatient
But you don't put on a show to get ovations
Take it to court and go through litagations
And I respect you gangsta
Treat you like a princess
And put something on your neck to thank you
She's my pinch hitter
When the startin lineup ain't playin right
I come off the bench with her
It might sound like I'm gassin you
But it take time to get from the back seat to the passenger
We been creepin and sneakin
Just to keep it from leakin
We so deep in our freakin
That we don't sleep on the weekend
Wifey's a little bit uptight
Wonderin why I keep coming home in the middle of the night
It'll be alright if y'all bump heads it'll be a fight
But I said it'll be alright

To protect you I'll get out and cock it
And you know the barrel of my gun is big enough to spit out a rocket
Oh, you gone play dumb if cops do come through
I gotta keep the top up if my drop do come through
But I know the boutiques and the shops you run through
So I cop her one and cop you one too
You always get a daily page weekly ring
Plus you ain't too shy to do them freaky things
I ain't gotta put a band on your finger
Or worry about you tellin the whole world I'm your man while I spring her
At first you was somethin I denied
Something I would slide
Just to do somethin in the ride
But shorty, there's something you provide
Cause the entree ain't as good without somethin' on the side you know?

That there's so much hatred in the world
I hope you don't mind if I ask you a question

Have you ever wondered why we're here?
What's it all about?  You've no idea
And everywhere you look, all you see is hatred
And darkness, death and fear
But you know it doesn't have to be
That I hate you, and you hate me
Cause even though we're different, it doesn't make a difference
And we can live in harmony!
No, you don't know who I am
But maybe I could hold your hand
And together we can understand about love!

Huh, I feel tingly!

[Shrignold]
Yes, that's love, my friend, and it's time for you to learn all about it! *giggles*

Cause everybody hates you, and no one cares!

And clean your brain

[Shrignold]
And forget anything about you ever knew!

And your heart will find its home

And join the king!

Oh, there you are
We've been looking for you all afternoon

[Duck]
We're sorry we upset you
But look
We've bought you the last boiled egg
To cheer you up!

218,What A Beautiful Day,"Day One
I stumbled through hello on 5th Avenue
Day Two
We grabbed a bite to eat and talked all afternoon
Caught a movie on Day Fourteen
And Day Sixty-Seven she said ""I love you"" to me

Chorus:
Oh, what a feeling
What a wonderful emotion
Yeah, what a life
Counting my blessings and knowing...
Ooh we had our ups and downs
All along the way
She had a chance to leave, but chose to stay

What a beautiful day
What a beautiful day

Day One Sixteen
I asked her what she was doing for the rest of my life
Day One Eighty Nine
Oh, I almost lost that girl to my foolish pride
But she said ""I do"" on day Four Eighty Two
And gave me a son on day Seven Sixty One

Oh, what a feeling
What a wonderful emotion
Yeah, what a life
Counting my blessings and knowing...
Ooh we had our ups and downs
All along the way
She had a chance to leave, but chose to stay

What a beautiful day

Day Eighteen Thousand Two Hundred and Fifty Three
Well, Honey that's fifty years
Yeah, here's to you and me

Oh, what a feeling

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'

[Verse 1]
When I pull up out front, you see the Benz on dubs (Uh-huh)
When I roll twenty deep, it's twenty knives in the club (Yeah)
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem and the hoes, they wanna fuck (Woo)
Look homie, ain't nothin' changed: hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the cut, hey nigga, roll that weed up! (Roll that)
If you watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit with a few shells, but I don't walk with a limp (I'm aight)
In the hood in L.A. they sayin', ""50, you hot"" (Uh-huh)
They like me, I want 'em to love me like they love Pac
But holla in New York, the niggas'll tell you I'm loco (Yeah)
And the plan is to put the rap game in a chokehold (Uh-huh)
I'm fully focused, man, my money on my mind
Got a mil' out the deal and I'm still on the grind (Woo)

Look, nigga, I done came up and I ain't changed (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
And you should love it way more than you hate it
Nigga, you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it (Woo)
I'm that cat by the bar toastin' to the good life
You that faggot-ass nigga tryin' to pull me back, right?
When my joint get to pumpin' in the club, it's on
I wink my eye at yo' bitch, if she smiles, she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talkin' about money, homie, I ain't concerned
I'ma tell you what Banks told me:
""Cuz, go 'head, switch the style up
If niggas hate, then let them hate, and watch the money pile up""
Or we can go upside your head with a bottle of bub'
They know where we fuckin' be

You don't really know what you got yourself into
Boy, you think you know, but it just ain't that simple
I don't got the time, you should
Read between the lines, 'cause you're
Skimming through the pages, it's
Really looking dangerous
You don't really know what you got yourself into

I don't got the time, you should
Read between the lines, 'cause you're
Skimming through the pages, it's

Make me feel like I could do anything
But I do not have the drive
I'm in desperate need of your speed
Of your speed, of your speed, of your speed
When I'm driving in your car
Make me feel like I could do anything
But I do not have the drive
I'm in desperate need of your speed
Of your speed, of your speed, of your speed

[Verse 2]
Baby, I can feel it coming, tell me, is it coming true?
Maybe it was going perfectly the way you planned it to
Lately I've been thinking all I really wanna do is go
Faster, can we go faster?
Something in the air, I really just don't wanna take it slow
If we waste the time, I think it might just make me miserable
Lately I've been thinking all I really wanna do is go
Faster, can we go faster?

222,I Believe,"[ELDER PRICE]
Ever since I was a child, I tried to be the best...
So what happened?
My family and friends all said I was blessed...
So what happened?

It was supposed to be all so exciting, to be teaching of Christ 'cross the sea
But I allowed my faith to be shaken – oh, what's the matter with me?
I've always longed to help the needy, to do the things I never dared
This was the time for me to step up, so then why was I so scared?

A warlord who shoots people in the face – what's so scary about that?
I must trust that my Lord is mightier and always has my back
Now I must be completely devout; I can't have even one shred of doubt!

I believe that the Lord God created the universe
I believe that he sent his only son to die for my sins
And I believe that ancient Jews built boats and sailed to America
I am a Mormon!
And a Mormon just believes

You cannot just believe part-way, you have to believe in it all
My problem was doubting the Lord's will, instead of standing tall
I can't allow myself to have any doubt, it's time to set my worries free
Time to show the world what Elder Price is about, and share the power inside of me!

I believe that God has a plan for all of us
I believe that plan involves me getting my own planet
And I believe that the current President of the Church, Thomas Monson, speaks directly to God
I am a Mormon!
And, dang it, a Mormon just believes! (A Mormon just believes!)

I know that I must go and do the things my God commands (Things my God commands!)
I realize now why he sent me here!
If you ask the Lord in faith, he will always answer you
Just believe in him and have no fear

[UGANDAN SOLDIER]
(General! We have an intruder! He just walked right into camp!)

[ELDER PRICE]
I believe that Satan has a hold of you
I believe that the Lord God has sent me here!
And I believe that in 1978 God changed his mind about black people! (Black people!)
You can be a Mormon!
A Mormon who just believes...

[GENERAL BUTT-FUCKING NAKED]
(The fuck is this?)

[ELDER PRICE]
And now I can feel the excitement: this is the moment I was born to do
And I feel so incredible to be sharing my faith with you
The scriptures say that if you ask in faith, if you ask God himself, you'll know
But you must ask him without any doubt, and let your spirit grow! (Let your spirit grow!)

I believe that God lives on a planet called Kolob!
I believe that Jesus has his own planet as well
And I believe that the Garden of Eden was in Jackson County, Missouri


If you believe, the Lord will reveal it
And you'll know it's all true – you'll just feel it
You'll be a Mormon!
And, by gosh, a Mormon just believes
(A Mormon just believes)

223,The Truth About Men,"We don't like to go out shopping
We don't care what's on sale
We just wanna sit with a bag full of chips
Watchin the NFL
When you come over at half time
And say does this dress fit too tight
We just look you in the eye with a big fat lie
And say ""uh uh it looks just right""

Well, thats the truth about men
That's the truth about us
We like to hunt and golf on our days off
And scratch and spit and cuss

And no matter what line we hand you
When we come dragging in
We ain't wrong
We ain't sorry
And it's probably gonna happen again

We hate watchin Steel Magnolias
We like Rambo and Die Hard 4
Jump up and down like fools
When we see the new tools
At the Home Depot store

We don't really wanna take you to dinner
At some fancy resturaunt
The only reason we do is cause
We know it leads too the one thing
That we all want

Well, that's the truth about men
That's the truth about guys
We'd rather pick guitars and work on cars
Then work on the problems in our lives

And though we might say it to you
Every now and then
We ain't wrong
We ain't sorry
And it's probably gonna happen again

Well, if you wanna know what we're all thinking
It's nothing to complex
It's just some thing cold for drinking
And a whole lot of S.E.X

Well, that's the truth about men
That's the truth about us
We like to hunt and golf and drive around lost
And scratch and spit
And a whole lot of other disgusting stuff

And no matter what line we give you
When we come crawling in
We ain't wrong
We ain't sorry
And it's probably gonna happen again

We ain't wrong
We ain't sorry
And it's probably gonna happen
Sure it's gonna happen
You know it's gonna happen again

But she keeps pulling me back in

226,Sing For The Moment,"[Verse 1: Eminem]
These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care, he's
A problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out (Bitch!)
'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stockin' cap
His step-father hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go

[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
In the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely ‘cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate (Huh-uh)
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, B
It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you! (Bitch!)

[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Sing that shit!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 3: Eminem]
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued
See, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they wanna get one ‘cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Ha-ha!)
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it ‘cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone, just let our spirits
Live on through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, and we can…

(When this began) I had nothing to say
And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
(I was confused) And I let it all out to find
That I'm not the only person with these things in mind
(Inside of me) But all the vacancy the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel
(Nothing to lose) Just stuck, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
(Erase all the pain 'til it's gone)
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
And I've got nothing to say
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face
(I was confused) Looking everywhere, only to find
That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind
(So what am I?) What do I have but negativity?
'Cause I can't justify the way everyone is looking at me
(Nothing to lose) Nothing to gain, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
(Erase all the pain 'til it's gone)
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I will never know myself until I do this on my own
And I will never feel anything else, until my wounds are healed
I will never be anything 'til I break away from me
I will break away, I'll find myself today

I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real

[Verse 1]
We go where we like
We got over time
We get paid to rattle our chains
We go in the back
Paint our money black
Spend it on the enemy
Sleeping in the church
Riding in the dirt
Put a banner over my grave
Make a body work
Make a beggar hurt
Sell me something big and untamed (Untamed)

Now our time, a real good time

We know how to pray
Party every day
Make our desolation look plain
Riding in a rut
Till the powers cut
We don’t even have a good name
Sleeping in the church
Riding in the dirt

229,Have You Forgotten?,"I hear people sayin'. We Don't need this war
But I say there's some things worth fightin' for
What about our freedom and this piece of ground?
We didn't get to keep em' by backing down
They say we don't realize the mess we're gettin in
Before you start your preachin' let me ask you this my friend

Chorus
Have you forgotten how it felt that day
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell
We had neighbors still inside goin through a livin hell
And you say we shouldn't worry about Bin Laden
Have you forgotten?

They took all the footage off my TV
Said it's too disturbin for you and me
It'll just breed anger is what the experts say
If it was up to me I'd show it every day
Some say this country's just out lookin' for a fight
Well after 9-11 man I'd have to say that's right

Chorus
Have you forgotten how it felt that day
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell
We had neighbors still inside goin through a livin hell
And we vow to get the ones behind Bin Laden
Have you forgotten?

I'v been there with the soldiers
Who've gone away to war
And you can bet that they remember just what they're fighting for

Have you forgotten
All the people killed
Yes some went down like heroes
In that Pennsylvania field
Have you forgotten
About our Pentagon
All the loved ones that we lost
And those left to carry on
Don't you tell me not to worry 'bout Bin Laden

[Интро]
Я, ха-ха, хэй
Я, юморист, on my wrist

[Куплет 1]
Нам не выжить без смеха, прям как без русского мата (эй)
Мой отец — КГБшник, а моя мать — с автоматом (да)
И мои дети — солдаты карательных батальонов
А мои братья — блюстители наших тёмных районов
Чувства юмора и нет, ведь так бы я давно смеялся
Над жизненной ситуацией, в которую загнал себя
Нет верёвки? Пусть тогда меня удушит галстук
Поскорей бы умереть, ведь я живу напрасно
Маколей Калкин и Галкин — мой Новый год, он снова гадкий, у
Что принесёт мне Санта, где подарки, может быть, жену?
Если русский Дед Мороз, тогда он принесёт войну
Шутники и юмористы развалили нам страну
Чё, смешно, сука? Чё ты там услышал? (пау-пау)
Я, чё, похож на клоуна? Ну-ка, встал и вышел (давай-давай)
У нас учителя, бывает, банчат гашишем
А ты мне чё-то затираешь здесь про своего бывшего

[Припев]
Gold on my wrist, я юморист
Пошутил не так — и ты попал в blacklist
Государева немилость, хоть я вроде бы и чистый
Небо самолётам, а цензура для артиста
Gold on my wrist, я юморист
Пошутил не так — и ты попал в blacklist
Государева немилость, хоть я вроде бы и чистый
Небо самолётам, а цензура для артиста

[Куплет 2]
Бандиты не на геликах — на геликах с мигалкой (да)
Базарим языком ГУЛАГа, воздухом со свалки
Мы копим на кусок гранита из-под палки
Собираем крошки, запивая просроченным Pulpy
Я устал, на часах почти семь вечера
Пьём пиво с пацанами — это Тайная вечеря
Я играю в гонки с мусорами, это всё не вечно
За это нож в печень, жизнь скоротечна (ха)

[Припев]
Gold on my wrist, я юморист
Пошутил не так — и ты попал в blacklist
Государева немилость, хоть я вроде бы и чистый
Небо самолётам, а цензура для артиста

We've come a long long way
No, I can't see the finish line
Scared half to death but that's okay
It's been a long long night
After a long long day
My body's aching but I know somehow
My feet will find a way

So I'll sing it loud in the silence
And give the best of me
'Til it's alright, but not over
I will find fight like a soldier coming home
In the silence
But I have never felt so free
The future's so bright
This is our time
I'mma live it how I dream

It's been a long long time
Since I've seen sunlight through the rain
Since I've felt love or truth, It's strange
But I left bliss back where I came
And I won't lie
It's taken so long to feel okay
And now the world is screaming out for more
But I don't feel the same

But we'll be alright
'Cause it's all we know
And it's only change
Sun sets on the old
But we're nocturnal anyway
And this is how we know
It'll be okay
These are the times we will hold
When our memories fade
'Cause it's all we know
And it's only change
Sun sets on the old
But we're nocturnal anyway
And this is how we know
It'll be okay
These are the times we will hold

These are the times we will hold
These are the times, woo!

These are the times we will hold in the silence
When I've given all of me
And it's alright that it's over
And I've found fight like a soldier coming home
In the silence
But I have never felt so free
The future's so bright, this is our time
And I'll live it how i dream, whoa

Because it's all we know
And it's only change
Sun sets on the old

Oh I start again go back to one
I'm running things my way
Can't stop me now, I've just begun
Don't even think about it
There ain't no way about it

It ticks just like a Timex
It never lets up on you
Who said life was easy
The job is never through
It'll run us till we're ragged
It'll harden our hearts
And love could use a day of rest
Before we both start falling apart

Pray that it's raining on Sunday
Storming like crazy
We'll hide under the covers all afternoon
Baby whatever comes Monday
Can take care of itself
Because we got better things that we could do
When it's raining on Sunday

[Verse 2]
Your love is like religion
A cross in Mexico
And your kiss is like the innocence
Of a prayer nailed to a door
Oh surrender in much sweeter
When we both let it go
Let the water wash our bodies clean
And love wash our souls

[Chorus]
Pray that it's raining on Sunday
Stormin' like crazy
We'll hide under the covers all afternoon
Baby whatever comes Monday
Can take care of itself
Because we got better things that we could do

When it's raining on Sunday
When it's raining on Sunday

If I'm somewhere else, it doesn't mean that I don't see
That you don't trust yourself, that's why you don't trust me
It makes me crazy, when you're crazy

But what you know is just skin deep

Of a book full of death reading how we'll die alone

In your house I long to be
Room by room patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone

And on my deathbed I will pray to the gods and the angels
Like a pagan to anyone who will take me to heaven
To a place I recall, I was there so long ago
The sky was bruised, the wine was bled, and there you led me on

In your house I long to be
Room by room, patiently

[Verse 1]
Be, b-boys and girls, listen up
You can be anything in the world, in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress
But nothing comes easy, it takes much practice
Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lena Horne, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person, got her strung on that heroin
Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Could've died, so young, now looks ugly and old
No fun 'cause now when she reaches for hugs, people hold their breath
'Cause she smells of corrosion and death
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how
Put your hands in the air, and take the vow

[Chorus]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Verse 2]
Be, b-boys and girls, listen again
This is for grown-looking girls who's only 10
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID
Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
You thinking life's all about smoking weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this

[Chorus]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be) (Now, go)

I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Verse 3]
Be, be-fore we came to this country
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
There was empires in Africa called Kush
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian Arabs and gave them gold, when
Gold was converted to money it all changed
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded
They heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose to impose what basically
Still goes on today, you see?
If the truth is told, the youth can grow
They learn to survive until they gain control
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more, learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king
Young Princess when you get your wedding ring
Your man is saying ""She's my Queen""

[Chorus]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Byłem bananem, teraz kasjerem, chwilę
No to co tu jest prawdziwe, bitch?
Niby skąd brać kwit jak płyta wychodzi w czerwcu
I chyba kurwa widać, że przed nią nie gram koncertów
To niby skąd, że co, że kurwa mama da?
Za duży jestem na to dlatego chodzę zarabiać hajs
Pietnastolatki mają bekę i to trochę przykre
Mówią, że handlarz skarpetek a potem idą na przyrkę
Kanapki w tornister i ojciec w Oplu
Pojadą do szkoły zaraz, tylko synek musi jeszcze opluć mnie
No to kto bekę ma prawo mieć?
Ja w pracy, czy on kłócący znowu z mamą o siano się
Jestem przy kasie, na razie robię pik pik
Niedługo też będę przy kasie jak już wpadnie kwit mi
A dzisiaj robię by na swoim być, czuję się lepszy
Nawet jak w drodze na ten szczyt mam sprzedawać skarpetki

Pelikany latają po necie, biorą w pysk co wpadnie
No i poleciał przeciek, że kasjer se zjada rap grę
Tylko pytanie - czy to dla gry wstyd jest, czy jest dla mnie?
Jestem normalny typ i codziennie latam za hajsem
A prawe oko to pożegnałem razem z wypadkiem, ponoć
I to jest straszne, no bo widzę połowę mniej
A rozjebuję się też na psach ponoć
I robić jak mam donos, skoro teraz widzę połowę mniej?
Parę lat temu próba zabicia przez hejty się
Już wtedy byłem znany no i wszyscy hejtowali mnie
Ty kurwo, te parę lat temu do szuflady wersy szły
Na majku z Tesco nagrywałem, marząc żeby spełnić sny
Szama jest za darmo, studio jest za darmo
Tłocznia jest za darmo, kurwa życie jest za darmo

Dla świata z którego przyszedłem, legalny sos to jest coś
Ziomek lata po mieście wciąż się bojąc, czy nie zgarną go
Syreny nie są bezpieczeństwem jak się musisz skradać
I gdy napierdala serce, a to jednak po sąsiada, bang
Gadamy kiedy biorę weed, bo nim czas umilam
Czekam aż z rapu coś wpadnie mi, a to jeszcze chwila
Więc kasuję, kasuję i tak bez przerwy
Kasuję kasuję, a już niedługo będzie pierwszy
I ja też niedługo tu będę pierwszy
I walę dynx za swoje gdy mama pierze skarpetki ci
To jest realtalk nie swag, idę dziwko po fejm
Mam go, teraz przydałby się banknot

Yes, live from the United States
Brooklyn New York its ya boy, Young

Soon as the beat drop, we got the streets locked
Overseas, at Panjabi MC and the Roc
I came to see the mamis in the spot
On the count of three, drop your body like it's hot
1, Young, 2, You 1,2,3
Young Hov's a snake charmer, move your body like a snake mama
Make me wanna put the snake on ya
I'm on my 8th summer, still hot -- Young's the 8th wonder
All I do is get bread, yeah I take Wonder
I take one of your chicks straight from under your armpit
The black Brad Pitt, I mack 'til six in the AM
All day I'm P-I-M-P, I am simply
Attached to the track like SMPTE
It's simply good, Young Hov, infinitely hood
Ni tu kari na kise de naal pyaar

[Verse 2 : Jay Z]
Ma, I ain't gotta tell you, but it's ya boy Hov
From the U.S., you just lay down slow
Catch ya boy mingle in England, meddling in the Netherlands
Checking in daily under aliases
We rebellious, we back home, screaming, ""Leave Iraq alone!""
But all my soldiers in the field, I will wish you safe return
But only love kills war when will they learn
It's international Hov, been having a flow
Before Bin Laden got Manhattan to blow
Before Ronald Reagan got Manhattan the blow
Before I was cabbing it there back and forth
Raw we had it all day, Papi in the hallway
Cop one on consignment to give you more yay
Yea, but that's another stor-ay
But for now, mami, turn it around and let the boy play (Jay)

246,How You Gonna Act Like That,"[Verse 1]
It seems like just the other day that we hooked up
(I was drivin', you was walkin' and I swooped you up)
From that moment on I knew you were the one, yeah
(I was single, you was lonely and we fell in love)
We would sit and talk for hours about anything
(Baby, you hang up, no, you hang up, on three hang up)
I bought your whip, I paid your rent, I gave you everything
(Said you'd always be my baby then you bounced)
How you gonna?

[Chorus]
How you gonna up and leave me now?
How you gonna act like that?
How you gonna change it up, we just finished makin' up?
How you gonna act like that?
How you gonna act like we don't be makin' love
You know we be tearin' it up, breakin' stuff, that ghetto love
How you gonna trip, how could you forget
How you gonna act like that

[Verse 2]
Girl, I never thought that lovin' you would hurt
(I did everything a good man would to make it work)
Girl, you should have told me you had second thoughts
(Like before I put the down on the house we bought)
Now I'm thinkin' you and me was a mistake
(But then it hits me and I'm missin' all the love we made)
Girl, I know that we've been goin' through some things, yeah
(But the sun is somewhere shinin' even when it rains, oh)

[Break]
I'll be the one you kick it to
I'll be the one that misses you
I'll be the one to ease your pain
I'll be the one you won't forget
And you'll be the one I can't forget
You'll be the one that's Heaven sent
You'll be the one I can't deny
You'll be the one that makes me cry, baby

[Chorus]
How you gonna up and leave me now? (Why you do)
How you gonna act like that? (Why you gotta act like this?)
How you gonna change it up? (Whoa, ho, baby) We just
Finished makin' up
How you gonna act like that? (But I need you)
How you gonna act like we (Oh) don't be makin' love
(Whoa: baby, baby)
You know we be tearin' it up, breakin' stuff, that ghetto love
How you gonna trip, how could you forget?
How you gonna act like that?

[Bridge]
You know I'm willin' to do anything
Just to keep you in my heart (Keep you in my heart)
I messed around and gave up everything
I thought we'd never part (Yes, I did, baby)
I was a player and made the choice to give my heart to you
And I gotta keep it that way, ooh, baby

[Chorus]
How you gonna up and leave me now? (Ooh, baby)
How you gonna act like that? (Why you gotta treat me this way?)
How you gonna change it up? (Why you treat me wrong?)
We just finished makin' up
How you gonna act like that? (Can me somebody tell me why)
How you gonna act (Why, why) like we don't be makin' love? (Hey)
You know we be tearin' it up, breakin' stuff, (Oh, oh, baby) that ghetto love
How you gonna trip? (All my friends became your friends)
How can you forget? (All my ends became your ends)
How you gonna act like that

247,Beautiful,"[Intro]
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
Then I'm reaching out for you

[Verse 1]
I'm just so fuckin' depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need somethin' to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when
I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent
But I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
I need a new outlet
And I know some shit's so hard to swallow
But I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact:
I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles—

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Verse 2]
I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything's so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature
Of the room, just as soon as
I walk in, it's like all eyes on me
So I try to avoid any eye contact
‘Cause if I do that, then it opens a door
For conversation like I want that
I'm not lookin' for extra attention
I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant
Tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny, like, ""Ha!
Marshall, you're so funny, man
You should be a comedian, goddamn!""
Unfortunately I am
I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down?
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles—

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Verse 3]
Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now, I could've either just sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid
Aunt Edna always told me:
""Keep making that face, it'll get stuck like that.""
Meanwhile, I'm just standin' there
Holdin' my tongue, tryin' to talk like this
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then
‘Cause I wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no mo'
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
‘Cause where you see it from where you're sittin'
It's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each other's shoes at least
What size you wear? I wear 10's
Let's see if you can fit your feet—

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

Is it my imagination?
Is it something that I’m taking?
All the smiles that I’m faking

Everything is fucking great”

Staring at the stars on the ceiling

And I’m off my face

And it couldn’t get better they say
We’re singing 'til last call
And it’s all out of tune
Should be laughing, but there’s something wrong
And it hits me when the lights go on
Shit, maybe I miss you

[Verse 2]
Just like that and I’m sober
I’m asking myself, “Is it over?”
Maybe I was lying when I told you
“Everything is great
Everything is fucking great”
And all of these thoughts and the feelings
Cheers to that if you don’t need them

Had a lighter load to bear
And a little bigger piece of the pie

Hey, go heavy on the good and light on the bad
A hair more happy and a shade less sad
Turn all that negative down just a tad

If my family farm never got sold
If another bad joke never got told
That'd be alright

I be that young handsome cat
Same color chocolate
Same nigga pop shit, same nigga got shit
Loon ain't no lame, Loon never gossip
Nigga Loon in the game cause Loon got some hot shit
Sick of you cats screaming out block shit
I done sold numerous drugs and drew the block sick
Look at me now, pull up in the drop six
Bitch in your block looked at my watch and she got sick
Look at her now, all up in the cock pit
Rolling my windows up to get a kid top quick
Loon is a pimp, trick ain't the topic?
Nigga you do the shrimp, trip to the tropics
That's not my steez, not like me
It's not the way I wanna blow my cheese, like I blow my trees
The whole world know I need, a girl that'll curl my toes for me

How you want that? Tell me how you want that
How you want that? Tell me how you want that
Daddy how you want to give it to me
A Bad Boy is what I need

[Verse: Loon]
Less confusion, party with Puff last conclusion
Grab shorty there wit the hair, ass is huge and
Lips is juicy, way she move her hips so loosely
Critical curves see it through furs
Curious so I want to see if it's hers
Delirious so I had to see if it's her (it wasn't me)
I ain't touch you that's on me and my words
You ain't gotta flip the script, kick me to the curb
Cause I was, just checking you wasn't disrespecting you
Lips so sexual while your friend's protecting you
Baby girl I know you're far from a slut
I know the difference between a car and a truck
I'm not a dumb nigga
You had these young niggas scarring you up
You know the difference between a scar and a cut
You're not a dumb nigga
So let's take it from the car to the club
And hit the bar and get a bottle of bub, and have fun nigga

[Hook]

[Verse: Loon]
Baby all bubble, have a lil chat a small huddle
Time to make money and more trouble
And we all hungry and all hustle
And we all humble, but together we got more muscle
And we got dough, nigga me and P we hot yo
Make a hip hop show look like a rock show
Ooh Jesus Christ! look the way that the rocks glow
Want the world to see so we keeping them tops low
Rascal, keep it on my lap for Broscoe
One shot your blood drip thicker than Basco
Drop though, keep the illest cat wit the hot flow
Watch your pro turn grown men to a snot nose
I pity a fool, never touch titties in schools
Son you can't hang wit Diddy and Loon
We allstars, nigga playing bet he was cool
Got more broads than you and any nigga in your crew, Bad Boy

Last night, I cried, tossed and turned
Woke up with dry eyes
My mind was racing
Feet were pacing
Lord, help me please
Tell me what I have gotten into

Ran my three miles to clear my mind
It always helps me out
It's my therapy
When I'm losing it which is usually

I'm on a emotional rollercoaster
Loving you ain't nothing healthy
Loving you was never good for me
But I can't get off

It's emotional rollercoaster
Loving you ain't nothing healthy
Loving you was never good for me (for me)
But I can't get off

[Verse 2:]
Yesterday, I told myself
I was gonna be okay
Gonna start a new day
Be truly happy
I was gonna take control of me

But eventually reality hit me
Mentally, physically, emotionally
And I opened my eyes and realized
That I was still being
Taken for a constant ride on your

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]

Then disappearing so suddenly
Up and down it goes

And I'm so tired of you pacifying me
With promises you know

Everybody's like, ""He's no item! Please don't like him
He don't wife 'em, he one nights 'em!""
Now she don't like him, she never met him
Groupies try to take advantage of him, he won't let 'em
He don't need 'em, so he treats 'em like he treats 'em
Better them than me, she don't agree with him
She's mad at that, he's not havin' that
So those opposites attract like mag-a-nets
She sees more than the Benz wagon, the friends taggin' along
With a flashy nigga braggin' on the song
She gets a glimpse of Shawn and she likes that
He 2-ways her, so she writes back
Smiley faces after all of her phrases
Either she the one or I'm caught in The Matrix
But fuck it, let the Fishburne
Red or green pill, you live and you learn, c'mon!

Sex-cuse me, damn!
You gotta throw on your fine linens for this one
You're so contagious, I can't take it

Gotta throw on ya Scooby Doo's; those are shoes by the way
You're so contagious, I can't take it
Gotta throw on Scooby Doo's, hehehehe

Excuse me; what's your name?
This for the grown and sexy, only for the grown and sexy
So hot to trot, lady, what's your name?

Love let's go half on a son, I know my past ain't one
You can easily get past, but that chapter is done
...but I'm done readin' for now
Remember spades face up, you can believe him for now
But ma you got a f'real f'serious role

'Bout to show you where the cheese, let you know I ain't playin'

I could love you more

It's not about being pretty
It ain't about being perfect
It's that little piece of matter
The tough-hided being

I could love you more
I could love you more

Make me song
Make me a sound
Vibrate, resonate

It takes the ear to hear the waves
And the heart to know your fears, so fear it
There's no hiding here

I could love you more
I could love you more

A song to see what he's saying
Do you see what I'm saying?
If there's no seeing of the saying
You're missing the something

I could love you more
I could love you more

It's not about three songs fast
Or two medium ones
It's about the sun's atmosphere
It's about sonic boom

I could love you more
I could love you more

Make me song
Make me a sound
Vibrate, resonate

It takes the ear to hear the waves
And the heart to know your fears, so fear it
There's no hiding here

I could love you more
I could love you more

Two hundred and fifty-three octaves below Middle C
There's a B-flat where a wave every year

I could love you more
I could love you more

Let us dance up that water
Let us have ears to hear
A song to agree with
A song to cheer

I could love you more
I could love you more

Make me song
Make me a sound
Make me song
Make me a sound
Vibrate, resonate
Make me song
Make me a sound",Eleanor Friedberger,2003,"[99, 99]",2
260,I'm With You,"[Verse 1]
I'm standing on the bridge
I'm waiting in the dark
I thought that you'd be here by now
There's nothing but the rain
No footsteps on the ground
I'm listening, but there's no sound

[Pre-Chorus]
Isn't anyone trying to find me?
Won't somebody come take me home?

[Chorus]
It's a damn cold night
Trying to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand?
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you
I'm with you

[Verse 2]
I'm looking for a place
I'm searching for a face
Is anybody here I know?
'Cause nothing's going right
And everything's a mess
And no one likes to be alone

[Pre-Chorus]
Isn't anyone trying to find me?
Won't somebody come take me home?

[Chorus]
It's a damn cold night
Trying to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand?
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you

Yeah-yeah, oh, why is everything so confusing?
Maybe I'm just out of my mind
Yeah-he-yaa, yeah-he-yah, yeah-he-yah, yeah-he-yah, yeah!

Trying to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand?

Take me somewhere new

261,Brokenheartsville,"He wore that cowboy hat to cover up his horns
Sweet talking forked tongue, had a tempting charm
Before I turned around that girl was gone
All I can say is, bartender pour me something strong

Here's to the past, they can kiss my glass
I hope she's happy with him
Here's to the girl who wrecked my world
That angel who did me in
I think the devil drives a Coupe de Ville
I watched 'em drive away over the hill
Not against her will and I've got time to kill
Down in Brokenheartsville

It was long and chrome, sitting in the lot
Fire engine red, that thing was hot
He reved it up, she waved goodbye
Love's gone to hell and so have I

Here's to the past, they can kiss my glass
I hope she's happy with him
Here's to the girl who wrecked my world
That angel who did me in
I think the devil drives a Coupe de Ville
I watched 'em drive away over the hill

262,The Anthem,"[Intro: King Tech]
One two, one two
We dedicate this one to the Hip-Hop culture, y'all
Brought to you by the world-famous Wake Up Show

[Verse 1: RZA]
Bobby Steels, Staple' tales, MC's get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred sword-play, tongue-twist piercin' holes in you
You can't escape 70,000 kilowatts blast through your box
Walk with alarm clocks, cars drivin' slow down the block
One stopped, parks, pops the trunk
Snare pops loud as Glock shots
Bass like an M-80 in your face cops stop, give us citation
We pause for radio station identification

[Interlude]
Wake up, wake up, wake up!
Tech is on

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
When I woke up, I grabbed the mic and never choked up
Busted a verse and all the G's in Cali loc'ed up
When I was summoned
Styles were mixed like the Drummonds
Killer clown is comin', look around, your town is crumblin'
This Big Tech from the Midwest
Leavin' MC's listless on the Wake Up Show
Make up no stories about my shake-up flow
Put me off in a cypher
Partner, you can't fuck with the sniper
Your flow's premature, clean your dirty diaper
Mic heister, psycho alpha-schizo
Hypno, cryo gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter
Sway and Tech heard me flow and it's sealed
Now I got Swedish women yelling ""Tech N9ne's vild!""

[Verse 3: Eminem]
This place is my house
I might as well erase my face with white out
‘Cause y'all can't see me like Ma$e's eyebrows (Where you at?)
Climbed out of a nice house
Through the front window, and heard this guy shout
""Hey that's my couch!""
Pull a 9 out during a rhyme bout
While I'm rippin' this shit, put a clip in and spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than a convertible flippin' vertical
Nose-first with the top off landing upside down
Get tied down and duct-taped—fuck rape!
I'd rather just hump a slut's leg with my nuts shaved
It's Sway and Tech, two disk jockeys
Breakin' so many freakin' needles I wonder if they inject

[Verse 4: Xzibit]
Lo and behold, better than platinum and gold
Yes, God bless success, never forsake the soul
Xzibit take control—locked, loaded, and ready to roll
Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold
‘Cause your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up
Or listen to my niggas Tech and Sway so you can wake up
The X-Man, catch me doin' drills in the Danger Room
Big game huntin' from high noon to the full moon

[Verse 5: Pharoahe Monch]
With synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush
From minimum thrusts
Bust multiple assaults in small interims
As horrid as Boris Karloff was
When I cut your neck, leave a little piece of skin
So the head won't fall off
Hauled-off, sawed off shotgun blast
He asked: ""Why did he have to die like cast metal?""
Oh, see, now like Omar Credle
We pone pedal at a high resolution
On the Wake Up Show with Sway, Tech and DJ Revolution

[Verse 6: Kool G Rap]
I sway the TEC with the Tech and Sway
Step away, weapon spray, rep today
Who over debt to pay get swept away
Across the whole board, like checker play
When I blaze, your whole sect' arrays
Wake Up Show for those who slept away
Niggas that met the tre, hit the deck and pray
DJ Revolution, spinnin' like lead from out the Heck and K
Tearin' your neck away, flood up the street with blood redecorate until the head of Jakes investigate

[Interlude: Jayo Felony]
Sway can give it to, but what you gon' do with it?
Tech can give it to you, but what you gon' do?
Rev can give it to you, but what you gon' do with it?
I can give it to you, wha-wha-wha-what-what!

[Verse 7: Chino XL]
Chino make the world go 'round
Fuckin' up entire record companies like Harrell did to Motown
Vominous talk, poison pen, ominous walk
Which flow will I destroy you with this time
The most commonest thought
The drama that's brought caught us
In the midst of a sibling rivalry
For instance, there is nothing born in existence that can survive with me
Clone me like sheep, I clean house like Tony Randall
My style filed sexual harassment, like Tisha Campbell
You wack like Will Smith, your rhyme style is pansy
I fuckin' murder your young style, like JonBenét Ramsey
Now who the master to beg?
Your demo get passed on the reg'
You shouldn't have been signed if you had a white cast on your leg
I'm Wake Up Show reppin' with Sway and Tech
My TEC's like Tekken, the industry weapon
I'm Chino X—bring KRS in!

[Verse 8: KRS-One]
De-de-de-da-de-de-de-da-di-day
KRS-One comin' with the Tech and Sway
Yo, I rock up on the littlest set and up on the biggest set
As ill as it gets I still manage to wiggle your neck with sweat
Never forget: the bigger the budget, the bigger the debt
You gotta be, willin' to rock in the middle of dry
And in the middle of wet
But I'm willin' to bet, on a Sway and a Tech, they stay in effect
Never been a pain in the neck, they gainin' respect
Nevertheless I wreck you
Now you know what Sway and Tech do
I'll be back, but for now just seckle
Ha ha ha! Fresh for 1999, you suckers!",Sway & King Tech,2003,"[91, 84, 62, 56, 50, 51, 43, 43, 50, 54, 56]",11
263,Straight Out Of Line,"[Verse 1]
There's no reason, there's no compromise
Change in seasons, living the high life
I don't know you, so don't freak on me
I can't control you, you're not my destiny

[Chorus]
Straight out of line, I can't find a reason
Why I should justify my ways
Straight out of line, I don't need a reason
You don't need to lie to me

[Verse 2]
I'll confess this: you're my tragedy
I laid you to rest just as fast as you turned on me
Gone forever, banished the memories
This place of pleasure are masked by your misery

[Chorus]
Straight out of line, I can't find a reason
Why I should justify my ways
Straight out of line, I don't need a reason
You don't need to lie to me
Lie to me

[Instrumental Break]

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro Chorus]
Straight out of line, I can't find a reason
Why I should justify my ways
Straight out of line, I don't need a reason
You don't need to, don't need to lie to me
Lie to me
Lie to me
Lie to me",Godsmack,2003,"[97, 94, 89, 79, 79, 81, 83, 73]",8

Right now, I feel invisible to you like I'm not real
Didn't you feel me lock my arms around you?
Why'd you turn away?
Here's what I have to say

I was left to cry there
Waiting outside there
Grinning with a lost stare
That's when I decided...

I was so alone
You, you need to listen
I'm starting to trip, I'm losing my grip, and I'm in this thing alone

When you turn around, can you recognize my face?

Waiting outside there
Grinning with a lost stare

Swervin' on corner like skrrt (skurrrrt)
She said, ""Can I text you?"" I'm like sure (surrrre)

And I might come ballin' like I'm Stephen Curry
Space Jam, Bill Murray, Munchies, Oreo McFlurry, whoa
I can't even lie, shawty thick and she purty
Work at the Blue Flame she doin' tricks up on that pole
I ain't even know that's your girlfriend
I'ma pass her like I'm Kyrie Irving
I'ma just take trips to Berlin
Why you tryna flex like you a virgin?

Get out my lane, that's candy paint
Took out the brain, I'm at the flame
We not the same, Louis V frame

Fuck what she sayin', she want a ring
Pimpin' ain't easy, Big Daddy Kane
Baby Ion't even know yo name
Hundred on the dash like I'm Dame
She wanna take trips to Romane
Call me David, I'm the one to blame

Why you tryna fuck with me babe? You got another guy
She said, ""Can I come again?"" Maybe, girl, another time
Tramp stamp on her back, what is that a butterfly?
Blowin' on the gas from the Amoco

Gotta stay strapped like I'm Rambo tho

268,Get By,"[Produced by Kanye West]

[Verse 1]
We sell crack to our own out the back of our homes
We smell the musk of the dusk in the crack of the dawn
We go through episodes too, like Attack of the Clones
Work 'til we break our back and you hear the crack of the bone
Just to get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
We commute to computers
Spirits stay mute while you egos spread rumors
We're survivalists turned to consumers
Just to get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
Ask Him why some people got to live in a trailer, cuss like a sailor
I paint a picture with the pen like Norman Mailer
Mi abuela raised three daughters all by herself with no help
I think about her struggle and I find the strength in myself
These words melt in my mouth, they hot like a jail cell in the South
Before my nigga Cor' bailed me out
To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
We do or die like Bed-Stuy
Through the red sky with the window of the red eye
Let the lead fly, some G. Rap shit, Living to Let Die

This morning, I woke up
Feelin' brand new, I jumped up
Feelin' my highs and my lows

Just to stop smokin' and stop drinkin'

Just to get by, just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by

Just to get by, just to get by
Just to get by, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
We keepin' it gangster, say ""fo' shizzle"", ""fo' sheezy"", and stayin' crunk
It's easy to pull a breezy, smoke trees, and we stayin' drunk
Yo, our activism, attackin' the system, the Blacks and Latins in prison
Numbers have risen, they're victims lackin' the vision
Shit, and all they got is rappin' to listen to
I let them know we missin' you, the love is unconditional
Even when the condition is critical, when the livin' is miserable
Your position is pivotal, I ain't bullshittin' you
Now, why would I lie? Just to get by?
Just to get by, we get fly, the TV got us reachin' for stars
Not the ones between Venus and Mars, the ones that be readin' for parts
Some people get breast enhancements and penis enlargers
Saturday sinners, Sunday morning at the feet of the Father
They need somethin' to rely on, we get high on
All types of drug, when all you really need is love
To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
Our parents sing like John Lennon: imagine all the people watch
We rock like Paul McCartney from now until the last Beatle drop

This morning, I woke up
Feelin' brand new, I jumped up

Just to get by, just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by

[Outro]
Yo-yo-yo, yo, yo
Some people cry, and some people try
Just to get by, for a piece of the pie
You love to eat and get high
We deceive when we lie, and we keepin' it fly
When the people decide to keep a disguise
Can't see they eyes, see the evil inside
But there's people you find
Strong or feeble in mind, I stay readin' the signs
Some people cry, and some people try
Just to get by, for a piece of the pie
You love to eat and get high
We deceive when we lie, and we keepin' it fly
When the people decide to keep a disguise
Can't see they eyes, see the evil inside

Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?

I tried to be a boy
I tried to be a girl
I tried to be a mess
I tried to be the best
I guess I did it wrong
That's why I wrote this song

This type of modern life, is it for me?

So, I went into a bar
Looking for sympathy

You are the best thing I've seen
You are not just a dream (American life)

I tried to stay on top
I tried to play the part
But somehow I forgot
Just what I did it for
And why I wanted more

I'm drinking a soy latte
I get a double shot-e
It goes right through my body, and you know I'm satisfied
I drive my Mini Cooper, and I'm feeling super-dooper
Yo, they tell I'm a trooper, and you know I'm satisfied
I do yoga and pilates, and the room is full of hotties
So I'm checking out the bodies, and you know I'm satisfied
I'm digging on the isotopes
This metaphysics shit is dope, and if all this can give me hope
You know I'm satisfied
I got a lawyer and a manager, an agent and a chef
Three nannies, an assistant, and a driver, and a jet
A trainer, and a butler, and a bodyguard, or five
A gardener and a stylist
Do you think I'm satisfied?
I'd like to express my extreme point of view
I'm not a Christian and I'm not a Jew
I'm just living out the American dream
And I just realized that nothing is what it seems

273,Girl All The Bad Guys Want,"[Verse 1]
Eight o'clock, Monday night, and I'm waitin'
To finally talk to a girl a little cooler than me
Her name is Nona, she's a rocker with a nose ring
She wears a two way, but I'm not quite sure what that means

[Pre-Chorus]
And when she walks
All the wind blows and the angels sing
But she doesn't notice me

[Chorus 1]
'Cause she's watchin' wrestling
Creamin' over tough guys
Listenin' to rap metal
Turntables in her eyes
It's like a bad movie
She's lookin' through me
If you were me, then you'd be
Screamin', ""Someone shoot me!""
As I fail miserably
Tryna get the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want

[Verse 2]
She likes the Godsmack and I like Agent Orange
Her CD changer's full of singers that are mad at their dad
She says she'd like to score some reefer and a forty
She'll never know that I'm the best that she'll never have

[Pre-Chorus]
And when she walks
All the wind blows and the angels sing
She'll never notice me

[Chorus 2]
'Cause she's watchin' wrestling
Creamin' over tough guys
Listenin' to rap metal
Turntables in her eyes
She likes 'em with a mustache
Racetrack season pass
Drivin' in a Trans-Am
Does a mullet make a man?
It's like a bad movie
She's lookin' through me
If you were me, then you'd be
Screamin', ""Someone shoot me!""

Tryna get the girl all the bad guys want
'Cause she's the girl all the bad guys want

There she goes again
With fishnets on, and dreadlocks in her hair
She broke my heart, I wanna be sedated
All I wanted was to see her naked!

[Chorus 3]
Now I'm watchin' wrestling
Tryna be a tough guy
Listenin' to rap metal
Turntables in my eyes
I can't grow a mustache
And I ain't got no season pass
All I got's a moped (Moped, moped)
It's like a bad movie
She's lookin' through me
If you were me, then you'd be
Screamin', ""Someone shoot me!""

We got the afternoon
You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me, discovering you
One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you want love we'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
I take all your big plans and break 'em
This is bound to be a while

[Chorus]
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder‚ I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland

[Verse 2]
Something 'bout the way
Your hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when
Crawling towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go
And though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it

[Pre-Chorus]
You want love‚ we'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
I take all your big plans and break 'em
This is bound to be a while

276,All I Have,"[Verse 1]
All I ever wanted was somebody to hear me
And all I ever wanted was somebody to feel me
And everybody wanna tell me that I'm out of my head
When I'm on the mic, that's fine, but that don't scare me
It's been a long time, but I'm back now
Rap pow, welcome to the rap house
Rap pow, will live 'til I pass out
Blackout, blackout, everybody keep on wonderin' if I still rap now
Are you serious?
Anybody out there hearin' this?
Yo, I came in the game as a lyricist
And I'ma leave like that, period
You sniff lines, I write lines
You've now entered in my mind
And you better get ready cause you might find
I'm from a different place, and my kind
It's a little bit different than yours is
Quit snoring, hip-hop isn't dead
It's just been in mournin'
From the moment I quit recording
Quick, record this
Listen, I'm warming up and you're misinformed if
You think that I'm slipping up, this ain't sick enough
Then I'll skip the chorus
I've been here, ain't nobody heard of me?
Yeah I'ma turn this beat to a murder scene
I don't live for the world
I live for the King, I live for the King, focus
Wrote this with emotion
It's hard to get a break when the doors ain't open
It's hard to get a shot when the gun ain't loaded
And it's hard to make a living when nobody wanna notice, hold it
What am I insane maybe? Plain crazy
You put me in a room with a mic you will not restrain me
You do what you wanted but you can't contain me, lazy
Is not a character trait of mine, don't wait in line
This is the current condition of my state of mind

[Chorus]
Don't tell me that this isn't real
Don't tell me this ain't how I feel
This is all I have, all I have

[Verse 2]
All I ever wanted was somebody to get this
All I ever wanted was somebody to play this
Yeah, take my song, put it on their playlist
And get goosebumps every time they play it, rate us
If that's my calling or not, Father, maybe I should just not bother
Go back to that nine-to-five, but I am not a quitter so quit that
I never been a killer but I guarantee I kill tracks
Put them in a coffin, lost in, rip that
Tryin' to make an impact in rap, is that insane?
Well, I guess so
Rap though, better give me that pencil
And you ain't ever gonna make it, it's all mental
I am in a place where I can't let go, agh!
I still work a job and do this, and y'all know what's stupid?
I thought all you had to do was get a record deal, and, your things start moving
But that's not the case, because most of the times—the artists you hear
You keep on thinking that artist is new, but that artist has prolly been at it for years
Yeah, in the back of my mind thinking, am I wasting my time dreamin'?
And I ain't got no money in my wallet, but I guarantee there ain't no way that I am gonna leave this
I need this, I swear to y'all, I need this
And this hip-hop's in my veins, if you cut me I'ma bleed it
And, yo, what you think I write raps for? No reason? No
Take my pain and I put 'em in a song—ever since them pills, they took my mom
I've been a different person, don't try to predict my verses
What you're hearing now is me whether I'm in front or behind that curtain
I stand behind these words here, I'm a Christian but I'm not perfect
Don't tell me to calm down, I'm calm now, listen, I'm just working
Yeah, it might take a minute to get it, but once you get it everything will be crystal clear
I don't think they see my vision here, I don't think they see my vision here!

[Chorus]
Don't tell me that this isn't real
Don't tell me this ain't how I feel
This is all I have, all I have
Don't tell me that this isn't real
Don't tell me this ain't how I feel
This is all I have, all I have
Don't tell me that this isn't real
Don't tell me this ain't how I feel

You high, baby?
Yeah
Yeah?
Talk to me
You want me to tell you something?
Uh-huh
I know what you wanna hear

[Refrain: Eminem (& Dina Rae)]
'Cause I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too
(I think I love you, baby) I think I love you too
I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me, baby, you know I want you too
They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
(Oh boy, you drive me crazy) Bitch, you make me hurl

[Verse 1: Eminem]
They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now: got no ring on this finger now
I'd never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship; save it, bitch!
Babysit? You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl, you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I tell a motherfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips? Bitch, why ask?
Kiss my dick, get my cash?
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out, I'll put you out
Won't get out, I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice? Buy you ice?
Bitch, if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What, you tryin' to be my new wife?
What, you Mariah? Fly through twice

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow

Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
It's no secret, everybody knows
Yeah, we fucked: bitch, so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends, I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kinda car I'll be in
We'll see how much you be'll partyin' then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?
I'd never love you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you

If I could leave here, I would leave here tonight
I'd be with you, I'd stay with you tonight

Bend over, you know how we do it, feet to shoulders
Bring heat to coldest night, so ferocious
Now you street promotin' the dick game is potent

Yeah, uh huh, okay
Once upon a time in College Park
Where they live life fast and they scared of dark
There was a little nigga by the name of Chris
Nobody paid him any mind
No one gave a shit
Knowing he could rap
No one lifted hands
So he went about his business and devised a plan
Made a CD and then he hit the block
50 thousand sold
Seven dollars a pop
Hold the phone
Three years later
Stepped out the swamp
With ten and a half gators
Now all around the world on the microphone
He leave the booth smelling like Burberry cologne
Still riding chrome
Got bitches in the kitchen
Never home alone
And he's on the grind
Please let me know if he's on your mind
And respect you'll give me
Ludacris I live loud just like Timmy
Fuck, have to clear these rumors
I got a headache and it's not a tumor
Get up on my lap and get my head sucked tight
Sprayed so I never let the bed bugs bite
Hard to the core
Core to the rotten
Jump down, turn around, pick a bale of cotton

I cried a river over you

[Bridge 1]
You drove me
Nearly out of my head
While you never shed a tear, babe
Remember?
I remember all that you said
You told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

[Verse 3]
And, now, you say you love me
Well, just to prove that you do
Why don't you cry me a river
Cry me a river
'Cause I cried a river over you, over you

[Bridge 2]
You say you love me, but you lie!

[Verse 4]
Now, you say you love me
Well, just to prove that you do
Come on and cry me a river
Oh, cry me a river
I cried a river over you
I cried a river over you

I cried a river
Now, you can, too

287,Soldier's Heart,"All hope was gone
Hard to hang on
Hard to be strong
Was blind, could not see
Nothing but walls in front of me
And inside no peace

And the mountains seemed impossible to climb
Until you stood on the front line
You led the way
Out of the darkness
We didn't go astray
You were ready to die for our sake
And that, that takes a soldier's heart

Oceans so deep
Uphill, so steep
But still we believe
And when the road was too far to travel
Heroes, you cared, you came and carried us there

And the mountains seemed impossible to climb
Until you stood on the front line
You led the way
Out of the darkness
We didn't go astray
You were ready to die for our sake
And that takes a soldier's heart

And so our flag was still there
All because you decided to care
Our burden to bear

You stood on the front line
You led the way
Right out of the darkness
Didn't go astray
You were ready to die for our sake
And that takes

You stood on the front line
You led the way
Right out of the darkness, hey
You could have let us go astray
You were ready to die for our sake
And that takes a soldier's heart
Whoa, that takes a soldier's heart, hey
It takes a soldier's heart",R. Kelly,2003,"[91, 80, 80]",3
288,I'd Do Anything,"[Intro]
And I would do anything for love
I'd run right into hell and back
I would do anything for love
I'll never lie to you and that's a fact

But I'll never forget the way you feel right now
- Oh no
- No way
And I would do anything for love
But I won't do that,
No I won't do that

Anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No I won't do that

[Verse 1]
And some days it don't come easy
And some days it don't come hard
Some days it don't come at all
And these are the days that never end

And some nights you're breathing fire
And some nights you're carved in ice
Some nights you're like nothing I've ever
Seen before, or will again

[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe I'm crazy
Oh it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me
No one else can save me now but you

As long as the planets are turning
As long as the stars are burning
As long as your dreams are coming true-
You better believe it!

[Chorus]
That I would do anything for love!
And I'll be there till the final act
And I would do anything for love!
And I'll take the vow and seal a pact

But I'll never forgive myself if we don't go all the way
Tonight

And I would do anything for love!
Oh I would do anything for love!
Oh I would do anything for love!
But I won't do that!
No I won't do that!

[Hook]
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that...

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that...

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that...

[Verse 2]
And some days I pray for Silence
And some days I pray for Soul
Some days I just pray to the God
Of Sex and Drums and Rock 'N' Roll

And some nights I lose the feeling
And some nights I lose control
Some nights I just lose it all
When I watch you dance and the thunder rolls

[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe I'm lonely
That's all I'm qualified to be
There's just one and only
One and only promise I can keep

As long as the wheels are turning
As long as the fires are burning
As long as your prayers are coming true
You better believe it!

[Chorus]
That I would do anything for love!
And you know it's true and thats a fact
I would do anything for love!
And there'll never be no turning back

But I'll never do it better than I do it with you
So long
So long

And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that, No
No. No, I won't do that!

[Hook]
I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that...

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that...

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that...

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that...

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that...

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that...

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do...

[Verse 3]
But I'll never stop dreaming of you every night of my life
No way

And I would do anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No I won't do that

[Call: Lorraine Crosby]
Will you raise me up?
Will you help me down?
Will you help get me right out of this Godforsaken town?
Will you make it all a little less cold?

[Response: Meat Loaf]
I can do that!

[Call: Lorraine Crosby]

[Call: Lorraine Crosby]
Will you cater to every fantasy I've got?
Will you hose me down with holy water - If I get too hot?
Will you take me to places I'll never know?

[Response: Meat Loaf]
I can do that!
Oh no, no, I can do that!

[Call: Lorraine Crosby]
After a while you'll forget everything
Just a brief interlude, and a mid-summer night's fling
Then you'll see that it's time to move on

[Response: Meat Loaf]
I won't do that
I won't do that

[Call: Lorraine Crosby]
I know the territory - I've been around
It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down

Woo, woo, yeah
Alright, here we go
Yeah yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Logic]
Money on my mind, so I'm too paid
Real all the time, never Kool-Aid, sippin' on D'usse, sike
Came a long way from G'burg
Puttin' in work like Ferg
New York to L.A., Hawaii and Japan
I'm the motherfuckin' man, 'least I'm feelin' like I am
Got the whole wide world in the palm of my hand
But don't give a goddamn, I'm Sam-I-Am
What that even mean? I don't know what you talkin' 'bout
Why nowadays everybody got a palm out?
PLP, yeah that be me and that be what I rhyme 'bout
I have arrived, all you rappers are in timeout
RattPack, where you at? (Everywhere worldwide!)
I know you been waitin' for this world to collide
B. O. double B. Y., H. A. L. L., and Folarin
'Bout to take it back like Doc and Marty inside the DeLorean
I am no historian, but here to make my predecessors proud
All you bitch niggas not allowed?
I put it on everything, I really want a cop out
But I did good for a dropout
Hop out the coupe, chicken heads go crazy
Gotta sound swag when the flow get lazy
What up? What good? Where you at? What you been on?
Anybody steppin' to me, promise they get shit on
Better hop up on the train 'fore you miss the chance to—
Hop up on the—hop up on the train 'fore you miss the chance to get on

[Verse 2: Wale]
Uh, smooth criminal, Mike Jack
Throw a subliminal, put your woman in black dress
They was in Timberlands, I was reppin' them Nike boots
'Member them nights that momma couldn't come right back
I'm on the path right now, put the plight on the mic
If I write mine down, I incite my crowd
I put Solbiato down (wholetime, wholetime!)
Used to go to Mark Twain, Mo County co-signed me
Got many flows that any ho would vouch for
I got many foes cause many hoes be out for
Had the Penny Foams, remember those was copper
Had so many homies talkin' 'bout, ""How you got those?""
I'm Phil Knight in real life, I'm real Nike
It's flight club in my house, they not like me
More than likely they ain't got the heart to fight me
It's a lie, somebody seein' me needs some Visine, yeah
Let me let it breathe
Saint Laurent level, weather never worry me
I'm well aware they be wildin’ when they talkin' me
They bitches in the ballot but whenever I be on the scene, oh
Hammers in the Uber, I be limousine though
Diamonds lookin' fluke but I got the same glow
And I got a juice back around the way though
My chain like a penguin's Pellegrino (woo!)
We cold, we cold
Used to be in LakeForest with the Kobe fro
Eddie Bauer coat, Foams and a load of dope
Boat load of white hoes I sold it to nigga
I was tryna survive, tryna survive
I was tryna survive, yeah, yeah
I was tryna provide, I was tryna survive
I put it down every time
Got some niggas alive, I got some niggas that not
Pour a little of brown liquor and look in the sky
Been the talk of the town, nigga, Virginia, Maryland
Did it all for the capital, hope you haven't forgot
Hoes love me a lot, niggas hate me a lil
Anybody can hear me for real give me they props
Hookin' up with a couple models, nobody's gon' try to play us
The motto is get your paper and make you a lot
Pulling up with the Young Sinatra, I'm looking like Sammy Davis
The MGM or the Vegas to shake up the rocks
And the Stadium poppin', the Palladium poppin'
It's a fifty a place nigga, she thinkin' about it
I'll be damned

Talkin' to the sunshine shinin' on my bald head
Now today seem strange
No call on my celly, no name on my caller ID
Callin' you up and ya OGs sayin' you ain't home
What's really goin' on? I wanna know
So gimme a call and let's play no games
I'm playin', you want the plane
Don't point a finger over herre
I bought you a fur coat for your birthday
And this the things I get shorty?
Over there you starin' mad
That I went out with them other chicks
I told you they ain't shit!
They were just some buddies from high school that I went to
Where my old homies wanted me to kick it to 'em
But I called you up but you wasn't home
Baby girl when you get this message, gimme a call
I'll be waitin' at home

I'm so sick of being lonely

And when I CALL HER, I keep gettin' the damn voice mail
What's goin' on? Yeah I know I'm wrong

AHH, don't finish yo statement
You alone call me, I'll be yo replacement

Let me lick you on your neck and go down to yo ankles
Cuz ain't no mo' better, freakier feller
From the Field to creep wit', when ya guys are dummy
Honey you lookin' good, and mo' gooder than a late of neck bones
Tenderized and yummy, the Energizer bunny can't compete with me
Cuz I be goin' and goin', rowin'
With mo' motion than ya ocean from night to mornin'
Hit it huffin' and puffin', breath stankin' and yawnin'

Damn what happened to that boy I heard he popped
Bullet count 9 times like when 50 got shot
Hope you fuck boys rot don't come into my block
I got niggas that'll shoot a nigga down like a cop
Got damn I thought it was yo year this year
Or next year or the next next next year
Nigga said he got a little buzz where the beer
My buzz a last longer than damn light year
Let me tell ya how I spit I spit that ill shit
If you catch the verse you'll catch the illness it's venomous
Got niggas coughing hard like they are some cinnamon
You ain't heard Platinum, mannnnn
I flex too much I try to keep it to a minimum
The chances they got is very minuscule
I'm the professor I teach lessons to niggas that reach too hard Send yo ass back with a green card
Keep being childish I'll send ya ass back to the playground
Niggas already know that i'ont play around
I move too fast for ya I might be a cheetah
I got Franklins in my pocket I ain't talking bout Aretha
Got damn Platzus just be saying some crazy'ish

Saw you 'round the other day
Shorty she was all the way

My possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof
In the paper today, tales of war and of waste
But you turn right over to the TV page

And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
Only shadows ahead, barely clearing the roof

297,Lifestyles Of The Rich And Famous,"[ Chorus ]
I hop into the hot tub
To lay back and relax and get a scrub and a back rub
Sippin on some wine
The view is dope, you see the Manhattan skyline
I got it made in the game
No stress, no worries, the only pain is the champagne
Put on the silk bathrobe
I liveth the life, plus I been around the globe
Throw on a Barry White tape
While girls file my fingernails and feed me grapes
Step on a paddy-o and look at the city
No need to look for a girl, I got three right here with me
I'm gettin paid all at once
And I got money in jackets I didn't wear in five months
Nothin come up but fast bread
And I be countin it all while I'm layin in a brass bed
I got a maid and a chauffeur
Girls comin over, sit on a plush leather sofa
I got a smile on my face
Bank accounts and Chase group signings inside my pillow case
Now I'm livin kinda fat
Cause I came from the street and made a g with a rap
Now you know what my name is
G Rap livin the lifestyles of the rich and the famous

[ VERSE 2 ]
Lookin TV, which one you wanna watch, gee?
Cause I got Sony, JVC, Magnumvox and Hitachi
See high prices are little to me
My suits are suede, plus robes are made in Italy
Spendin money like water
Rich men across the border offer me their daughter
And I'm never in a slump
Cause my big pockets got more lumps than Donald Trump's
Pretty women in my face, see
Took Gayle to Bloomingdale's and met Tracy at Macy's
Suckin on money like a vacume
Never got it hard, cause I got credit cards that are platinum
Not to mention the gold Visa
Got a safe in the wall behind paintings of Mona Lisa
Chandeliers in the hall
Ten stuffed deer heads are on my living room wall
More bills than Stills & Nash
I like to flash, cause I got more stash than Johnny Cash
Gold faucets on my sinks
Inside of my bedroom I got at least 20 fish tanks
I got power, and I'm known
See, I can call the President up straight on that red phone
So now you know what my game is
It's the lifestyles of the rich and the famous

[ VERSE 3 ]
I get the opposite sex
Cause while I write out checks, diamonds are shinin in my Rolex
My clout is outrageous
I'm on the phone with the owners of casinos in Las Vegas
Lookin heavy every day
I wear a pair of shoes once, and I'm throwin em away
Everything is like a breeze
I hired MP's just to guard all my ki's
Girls throwin lillies in my path
I got a yacht that makes the Love Boat look like a life raft
Mega-mega-mega-bucks
To make a deposit, I gotta call up armored trucks
Smilin while I'm stylin
I gave a girl her first lesson in sex on the Virgin Islands
Cause I'm the real money maker
More bread than a baker, the dead-president undertaker
A young brother gettin notes
I flew to London for the fog, just because I had the coat
So much money to spill
Whoever's not in my will might even get a mill
You want a car? That's miniture
No cash, don't sweat it, because my credit is my signature

298,Damaged,"[Intro: Bmike]
I've been, I've been through a lot of crazy things in my life and somehow you're always there to, always there to pick up the pieces and accept me for who I am
So listen

[Verse 1: Bmike]
I never meant for you to deal with all this pressure
Or for you to deal with all this pain that don't belong to you
You carry all my burdens from my past on a stretcher
So the very least that I can do is write this song for you
Baby you don't have to choose to stay but yet you do it anyway
And for a moment I get glimpses of what's in the heavens gates
You show me beauty in the rain, even smiling when it's pouring
The creases on the corners of my lips still feel so foreign to my senses
I sense that you might leave me in an instant
You don't, it's just my insecurities are up to mischief
You reassure me, you show me love and then it cures me
Not with words because the actions of your promise does it for me
It's lovely, I'm used to feeling cold that's below zero sub ze-ro beneath my mind that if I wish I could not unsee
It's crazy, I know the baggage in my trunk is ugly but you still choose to love me

[Chorus: Bmike]
How can you love someone so damaged?
Feel it in my palms, feeling so beyond
You don't know how to respond
Everyday this thing gets harder to manage
Been there from the start
Even when you saw the black that's covering my heart
I showed you scars that are deeper than what you have known
And you tell me I've never looked more beautiful
So I'm sorry that I'm damaged
I'm sorry for the pain
I'm sorry that you probably have to deal with it again

[Verse 2: JayteKz]
I said I'm sorry for the pain but I can't help this shit, I wish you never felt this shit
Promise you're my angel but I'mma probably go to hell for this
Mentally I am sick and I don't choose to break your fucking heart
My life's a tragic flick and I ain't choose to play this part
I'll take apart my heart and let you find the missing pieces
It's lost inside the dark and being consumed by all my demons
I slowly weaken, my wounds and cuts they only deepen
And while you heal me you become a victim of mistreatment
I'm fucking sorry, the traces of my past just taunt me
The future's daunting when the present feels so damn disheartening
How could you want me?
You found me right when I had lost me
You hold me tight through all the fights although it's so exhausting
And it's so lovely, you never let the pressure crush me
I made you feel so low while you put no one else above me
I know the baggage in my trunk is ugly and yet you still choose to love me

[Chorus: Bmike]
How can you love someone so damaged?
Feel it in my palms, feeling so beyond
You don't know I am respawned
Everyday this thing gets harder to manage
Been there from the start
Even when you saw the black that's covering my heart
I showed you scars that are deeper than what you have known
And you tell me I've never looked more beautiful
So I'm sorry that I'm damaged
I'm sorry for the pain
I'm sorry that you probably have to deal with it again

[Outro: Bmike]
I never meant for you to deal with all this pressure

299,Thugz Mansion,"[Intro: 2Pac]
Shit, tired of gettin' shot at
Tired of gettin' chased by the police and arrested
Niggas need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong, that's just for us
Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Y'knahmean? Where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free
And you gotta be a G, at thug mansion

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times
I once contemplated suicide, and woulda tried
But when I held that 9, all I could see was my mama's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We found a finally spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye, I see this place the players go and pass it
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Will I survive all the fights and the darkness?
Trouble sparks, they tell me: ""Home is where the heart is.""
Dear departed, I shed tattooed tears
And couldn't sleep good for multiple years
Witness peers catch gunshots; nobody cares
Seen the politicians ban us, they'd rather see us locked in chains
Please explain why they can't stand us
Is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?
I need a place to rest my head
With the little bit of homeboys that remains
‘Cause all the rest dead; is there a spot for us to grow?
If you find it, I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful? I'm comin' from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream ""Peace!"" while the other man shot him
I need a house that's full of love, when I need to escape
The deadly places slingin' drugs, in thug's mansion

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Dear Mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drinkin' peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm 'til the day came
Little Latasha sho' grown
Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand
Only God can save us, when Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'
Remember this face, save me a place in thug's mansion

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton & (2Pac)]
Ain't no place I'd rather be

304,You Can't Hide Beautiful,"She says don't stare at me
She's afraid that I might see
Those 5 extra pounds she talks about
Man, I don't know what she's talking about

She looks through magazines
With every page she dreams of
Looking like somebody else
I wish she wasn't so hard on herself

Then she falls asleep with just my t-shirt on
But even when her hair's messed up and her make-up's gone

Chorus

You can't hide Beautiful
You Can't hide wonderful
There's nothing that she has to do
It just comes natural
She makes it look easy
I love what she does to me
No way to disguise
The way that she shines
You can't hide beautiful, oh no

She can take a simple dress
Put it on and turn some heads
Man Everytime she moves she gets me
She doesn't even know she's sexy

And the way she thinks sometimes
Out of no where blows my mind
She makes me laugh and makes me dream
I love the way she looks at things

A little piece of heaven god gave to this world
She might think she's just an ordinary girl

You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You ain't a friend of mine, you ain't no kin of mine
What makes you think that I won't run up on you with a 9?
We do this all the time, right now we on the grind
So hurry up and cop and go, we sellin' nicks and dimes
Shorty she so fine, I gotta make her mine
An ass like that gotta be one of a kind
I crush 'em every time, punch 'em with every line
I'm fuckin' with they mind, I make 'em press rewind
They know they can't shine if I'm around to rhyme
Been on parole since '94 'cause I commit the crime
I send you my line, I did a three-to-nine
If D's ran up in my crib you know who droppin' dimes

You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'

You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership, but you never cop nothin'
You been hustlin' a long time and you ain't got nothin

[Verse 2]
Damn, homie
In high school you was the man, homie

If you play with my paper you gotta meet my Beretta
Now shorty think I'ma sweat her sippin' on Amaretto
I might hit once, then dead her, I know I can do better
She look good, but I know she after my cheddar
She tryin' to get in my pockets, homie, and I ain't gon' let her
Be easy, start some bullshit, you get your whole crew wet

But it's me you see on your TV

'Cause I hustle, baby, this rap shit is so easy

By any means, partner, I gotta eat on these streets
If you play me close for sure I'm gonna pop my heat
Niggas sayin' they goin' murk 50, how?

Met you in a café
At a table meant for two
You were sitting by your lonesome
When I sat down with you
Tried hard not to show it
But I couldn’t help but see
That you wore your broken heart out on your sleeve
And your loneliness could not disguise
The beauty and the charm
Thought if I ever get you, shattered lady, in my arms

[Chorus]
I’m going to rock you baby to sleep
I’m going to make you crazy over me
I’m going to hold you like you’ve never been held before
And love you till you tell me you can’t love anymore
I’m going to shake your emotion right down to your soul
And then I’m going to love you all over in and out of control
If this is how love is supposed to feel
Baby I know I’ve fallen head over heels
I’m going to rock you baby

[Verse 2]
Over open conversation and a bottle of red wine
You said this world is full of users and I know that I’ve had mine
We danced a little slow dance until they closed that café down
You said ‘what would be the chances that tonight I finally found
Someone who makes me feel like my life is just begun?’
I said ‘girl believe in me and I’ll show you how it’s done’

[Chorus]
I’m going to rock you baby to sleep
I’m going to make you crazy over me
I’m going to hold you like you’ve never been held before
And love you till you tell me you can’t love anymore
I’m going to shake your emotion right down to your soul

Two days past eighteen
He was waiting for the bus in his army greens
Sat down in a booth in a cafe there
Gave his order to a girl with a bow in her hair
He's a little shy so she give him a smile
And he said ""would you mind sitting down for a while
And talking to me? I'm feeling a little low""
She said ""I'm off in an hour and I know where we can go""

[Verse 2]
So they went down and they sat on the pier
He said ""I bet you got a boyfriend, but I don't care
I got no one, to send a letter to
Would you mind if I sent a-one back here to you?""

[Chorus]
I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waiting for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home

[Verse 3]
So the letters came from an army camp
In California then Vietnam
And he told her of his heart, it might be love
And all of the things he was so scared of
Said ""when it's getting kinda rough over here
I think of that day sitting down on the pier
And I close my eyes, and see your pretty smile
Don't worry but I won't be able to write for a while""

[Chorus]
I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waiting for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waiting for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter says a soldier's coming home

[Verse 4]
One Friday night at a football game
The Lord's Prayer said and the anthem sang
A man said 'folks, would you bow your heads
For a list of local Vietnam dead""
Crying all alone under the stands
Was a piccolo player in the marching band
And one name read, and nobody really cared
But a pretty little girl with a bow in her hair

I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy

I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em

Pull up a stool and we can begin the schoolin'
Ooohin and Ahhhin
Really don't matter as long as the rapper
They know who's shit is phatter
And who should be beggin' the pardon
For the disaster as I blast you into
Anti-matter make you scream out uncle
As I punk you with the funk
Watch you buckle like a punk will
Another chump killed
As I chuckle pumpin' steel through the steel
So that I can steal the show
The bunk had no appeal
Meaning that I don't feel the whack
EVEN when you be feeling that
No matter how slow you go
You still got no-THING to say
When skills are softer than clay matter
C'mon man, that ain't where the cash is
You musta thought that pretty ass shit was gon' make
Some dough on the strength of those promo pictures
Ho
Blow me down
I gets down
That even if we go just one more round
And I'm from the 'O'
Challenging you in your own goddam town
And I know the homies gon' clown
When they hear the profound thoughts and
Experiences applied from my strife to the
End of your life on this mic
The years run off by the hour
The aspirations FLEE with the YEARS
As they get devoured with time
Eventually you will age and collapse
What good are your raps if your
Synapses can't fire
The rapid rhymin' and tactics
That I can flash with
Automatically blastin' back and
Cappin' and laughin' at all of this whack
Material that you brought
Devoid of substance lacking
Action between word and thought and
Perhaps it's best for e'rybody
If we just cut short

Silence
You itch you lust
Your breath is taken
When you awaken
In the state of the shock
Thoughts of ex-communication
And the implications of that situation
Racin' through your floggin' stopped up
Noggin' as you're massagin'
You're jarred
What's that you saw
You try rememberin' but it's foggier than
Fisherman's wharf
At six in the mornin'
Through the gloom of dawn
Your doom is doomin' like the
Moon you know when you'll be due
And you'll die and soon

And when you die
Your heart stops
The brain is TECHNICALLY ALIVE
For three or four minutes
Digesting the curse for the next 24 hours
Give or take a smidgen
Blood remains viable for several hours and
Settles down once the body's downside is
Darker and you will mottle
The grip of rigor mortise clenches it's fist
And two to six hours
Relinquishes
Two to three days later by this time
The stomach is bloated with gaseous
Fumes consumin' will blow shit up fo' sho'
Oh by the way
The flesh decomposes fast
Veins and skin turn
Blue, purple, green and black
Nose and softer tissue turns to a
Jelly consistency thicker than Jell-O
Cornea of the eyes are no longer clear
Sickly jaundiced yellow
When you see and it softens
Eyes they melt in their sockets
Watch the skin pull away
From the gum-line leavin' no lips
So what's left and
A wicked grin
Bacteria thrive nightcrawlers fill
No morrow only hunger
Maggots arrived and now's devourin'
Decayed and sourin'
But hey
Really though
Why even trip
It ain't
Only the physical in which
Your consciousness exists
And in the end
Forensic details are about as important
As the gear your sportin'
So why even resist
Ya trick
You should desist and listen
To the mix your missin'
With the kicks that's hittin'
In the midst of the mist
Into which your slippin'
The lights start to dim
And the lesson of infection
You're witnessin' is the wreckoning

Winded old and you'll POP
You cease to exist
Terror in your eyes
And a smile on your lips
When you hear the remix
You cease to exist
Terror in your eyes
And a smile on your lips
When your heart lights up
You cease to exist
Terror in your eyes
And a smile on your lips
When you hear the lyrics
You cease to exist
Terror in your eyes
And a smile on your lips",Lateef the Truthspeaker,2003,"[88, 88]",2

327,Air Force Ones,"[Refrain repeated throughout song]
Big boys

[Chorus]
(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

[Verse 1: Nelly]
I like the all-white, high-top strap with the gum bottom
There's somethin' bout 'em, now dirty that's why I got 'em
I leave 'em strapped and laced and come up out 'em
The last person that touched 'em I been shot 'em

[Verse 2: Kyjuan]
Now if you look, and see lime-green Forces; it's Kiwi
You couldn't get this color if you had a personal genie
You know I keeps it hip-hop; my niggas flip-flop
Yeah, my Force Ones in tip-top (me) now form a flip flops

[Verse 3: Ali]
Me? I like the limited edition in khaki and army green
Patent leather pin stripe you should see how I do the strings
Size twelve with the strap, red and white with a Cardinal cap
All flavors but it just depend on when and where I'm at

[Verse 4: Murphy Lee]
Don't get me wrong, man
And Murphy Lee ain't dumb, man
Cause if the shoe is on the shelf
You should have some, man
You can not sit up and tell me that you have none, man
You may not have three or four
But you got one, man (big boy)

[Chorus]
(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

[Verse 5: Murphy Lee]
We up in Foot Locker; I'm lookin' like I need those
Ten in a half and if you got 'em give me two of those
I can tell she never seen Murphy Lee befo'
Cause she's just standin there as if I'm shootin free throws
I said, ""Excuse me miss I only wanna buy shoes""
She said, ""I love you Murph especially in the white 'n blue""
I said, The white 'n blue sound nice make it twice""
And I signed an (yo) autograph (yo), ""Thanks for the advice""

[Verse 6: Ali]
I keep it real dirty, dirty you know how I do
Purple in gold with the Lakers the Broncos the orange and blue
I like 'em floppy with ankle socks
Lows mids and high tops,  which are clear so
But this tims and fat laces with it is cold
But when the winter go (burrr) and the hot summer flow
Then it's back to the all purpose wit them lil' dots in the toe
Then I'm stopping this dough that I'm spending fa sho
On dem Nike Air Force, ""NE"" behind the ""O""

[Verse 7: Kyjuan]
O-kay Lee, I treat my shoe like my ride
Chrome on the fat laces at what wood on the inside
Spray candy on the swoosh, with the electric roof
Since I put a kit on the sole, I got a wider shoe
You see that low-mid Skittle purple coupe I'm drivin in
(Kyjuan, were you getting dem colors, are you dyin them)
Ten is my size in dem, no point in tyin dem
Ain't no point in tryin these on, you know I'm buyin dem

[Verse 8: Nelly]
Now don't nothing get the hype on first sight like, white on whites
Them three quarters, them lows, they all tight
The only problem they only good for one night
Cause once you scuff 'em you fucked up your whole night
What's my basis? The look on store owner's faces
This kid's outrageous, he's buyin them by the cases
Cause once I cop 'em gut 'em and switch the laces
They all purpose ya heard me kinda like my daytons

[Chorus]
(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

[Verse 9: Kyjuan]
I wore spurs at first now theres tape on dem
Damn, when those came out? So I write the date on them
These Louis Vuitton ones, you gotta wait on dem
I had to get em early so I spent more cake on dem

[Verse 10: Murphy Lee]
Look I'm tryin to keep it up like a one minute man
While Ali on the Kawasaki two head bands
Jewelry and all (wow) fish bowlin 'em all
(I got some fifteens) security buyin shoes and all

[Verse 11: Nelly]
Now some time I get em free some time I gotta pay
Walk in the mall and they now what I'm bout to say
Gimme the black and platinum, and leather gray
Ones in the back and (yo) the pair you got on display (check)

[Verse 12: Ali]
Now where da boxes where I keep mine (keep mine)
You should peep mine , (beep mine)
Maybe once or twice but never three times
I'm just a sneaker pro, I love Pumas and shell toes
But can't nothin compare to a fresh crispy white pearl

[Chorus]
(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones

328,Underneath It All,"[Verse 1]
There's times when I want something more
Someone more like me
There's times when this dress rehearsal
Seems incomplete
But you see the colors in me
Like no one else
And behind your dark glasses
You're something else

[Chorus]
You're really lovely
Underneath it all
You want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
You're really lovely

[Verse 2]
You know some real bad tricks
And you need some discipline
But lately you've been trying real hard
And giving me your best
And you give me the most gorgeous sleep
That I've ever had
And when it's really bad
I guess it's not that bad

[Chorus]
You're really lovely
Underneath it all
You want to love me
Underneath it all
I'm really lucky
Underneath it all
You're really lovely

[Bridge]
So many moons that we have seen
Stumbling back next to me
I've seen right through and underneath
And you make me better
I've seen right through and underneath
And you make me better, better, better

[Verse 4: Lady Saw]
For real!
'Cause underneat' it all, you are my real Prince Charmin'
Like the heat from the fire, you were always burnin'
Anytime you’re around, my body keeps callin'
For your touch, your kisses and your sweet romancin'
There’s another side of you, weh this a woman yah adore
Aside from your temper, everything else secure
You’re good for me, baby, for that, I’m sure
'Cause over and over again, me want more

[Verse 5]
You've used up all your coupons
And all you got left is me
And somehow I'm full of forgiveness
I guess it's meant to be…

You want to love me

329,I Just Wanna Be Mad,"Last night we went to bed not talking
'Cause we'd already said too much
I faced the wall, you faced the window
Bound and determined not to touch

We've been married seven years now
Some days it feels like 21
I'm still mad at you this morning
Coffee's ready if you want some
I've been up since five
Thinking about me and you
And I've got to tell you
The conclusion I've come to

I'll never leave, I'll never stray
My love for you will never change
But I ain't ready to make up or get around to that
I think I'm right, I think you're wrong
I'll probably give in before long
Please don't make me smile
I just want to be mad for a while

For now, you might as well forget it
Don't run your fingers through my hair
Yeah that's right, I'm being stubborn
No, I don't want to go back upstairs
I'm going to leave for work
Without a goodbye kiss
But as I'm driving off
Just remember this

I'll never leave, I'll never stray
My love for you will never change
But I ain't ready to make up or get around to that
I think I'm right, I think you're wrong
I'll probably give in before long
Please don't make me smile

And I fret so much about her loving
I wish she'd let me be

When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it

[Verse 2]
What is she thinking, too much uncertainty
Why can't she give some sort of sign
You know and I know a thing or two about loyalty
But that girl don’t pay it no mind

[Pre-Chorus]
And is it really my fault
I get a shiver when I see her with those other guys
Wearing the jacket I bought
I can't help but lose my temper and I don't know why

[Chorus]
I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it
When the fellas talk to my girl I ain't with it
I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it

[Bridge]
I get strung up from her loving
I wish she'd cared to see
But she only cares when she's so inclined
And I fret so much about her loving
I wish she'd let me be
But out destinies got us so intertwined
Back in 2011, I decided
To not let this play with my mind
But when the boys from out of town
They come back around
I feel like committing a crime, yeah

[Chorus]
I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it
When the fellas talk to my girl I ain't with it
I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it
I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it
When the fellas talk to my girl I ain't with it
I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it

Kick off my shoes and relax my feet
Hit the kitchen grab a bite to eat
Now, it's been one of those crazy weeks

Got to take time out
And all my real ladies know what I'm talking about, sing

One of those days

And the simple things are not wasted
One of those days
When you're cruising in your car
And you might just see the stars
And it's warm outside and beautiful, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Tonight, it's all about me
Just want to set my body free

Sometimes hate can be the best love

Walkin' in like I got cameras on me
Niggas can't control me, ain't no handles on me
Shit don't get out of hand, it get handled, homie
Got a pretty young girl look like Janet on me
She a pretty penny and she know I'm doing numbers
Till we crash up the whole database
I bring it home like I'm base to base to base
Closet lookin' like Planet of the Bathing Apes
What you think this life just landed on me?
My whole city look like it's abandoned, homie
And we came straight out of those abandoned homes
Every wish we ever had got granted, homie
And I'll never take that shit for granted
Even when the marble floor and counter top is all granite
Back before I got paid any advances
Back when my rollie was ticking, no dancing
Nigga, never did I slip or I panic
Even if I was the captain of Titanic
Riding through the north Atlantic, homie
I never jumped crew or abandoned, homie
All the fruits of my labor organic, homie
Making sure my family tree got hammocks on it
And a good guy can change, 'specially if he short-changed
So fuck is my ransom, homie?

[Verse 1: Malice]
When we met, I was talkin' that game, parkin' that thang
Since then between us, a lot of things changed
Now it's like the world got a whole different name
I can't stop chicks from sayin' my name
Most of it's lies, if not, don't be surprised
You knew I was ballin' when I met you
But really, I started layin' low just to net you
I'm raw as hell yet can't deny that you special
These girls can't either, winter, his and her Vivas
Summer, his and her Louie sneakers
You don't think that bother people?
Guess again, you even need to check your friends
Sayin' that I cheat, right, maybe with my heat
Got a pearl handled chrome thing that I call Sweets
I greet with her, creep with her, even eat with her
Late nights under my sheets, yeah, I sleep with her
But thats it

[Chorus: Clipse & Faith Evans]
Look, ma, I don't love her
Don't listen to her words
She tryna split up us lovebirds
But that's not it
Now you see me buyin' her whips and shit? (No)
You see me sendin' her on trips and shit? (No)
If the answers no, don't forget (How's she know you then?)
I don't know

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
If I don't know I don't know, let's not go that road
I don't know who she is, don't care who told
Look, stop flippin', no need to explode
I seen the number in the pager, I don't know that code
In the streets too much? C'mon, that's absurd
Gettin' no complaints when I be flippin' them birds
Your girls just talk 'bout this, that and the third
Believe half what you see, none of what you heard
You askin' me who's her, I'm askin' who's mink fur
With that rock on her hand makin' their eyes blurred
Could that be you plus who cop every gem?
Who spend like I spend? Then act like it then
Got the dream home and we settled in it
Our lives too perfect, that's why they meddle in it
Now, just chalk it up as just part of the game
You know who I'm about, who got part of my name?

Look, ma, I don't love her
Don't listen to her words

I bet you'd tell me anything (Yeah, that's right)
Just to be with me (Yep and tonight's the night)

[Verse 3: Malice]
I'm not most men, my heart truer than theirs
Of course your girls hate, our whips newer than theirs
We hardly fight, arguements way fewer than theirs
Even down to the ice, look, bluer than theirs
What they gon' tell us about us, huh?
What they gon' talk 'bout without us, huh?
The envy got 'em speakin loosely
Tell 'em walk in your shoes but first let 'em know they Gucci

[Verse 4: Pusha T]
And even if I did twist her, I promise I didn't kiss her
Wasn't shit touchy feely
Grudge on the floor like Mister did to Celie, no respect shown
My homies laugh while she talk dirty on the speaker phone
Now don't you start, I spared your heart
If you ain't see it, I didn't do it, ain't I played my part?
Bricks, chicks, whips, chips, that just go with the grind
What else do you want from me? To say it? Fine

[Chorus: Clipse & Faith Evans]
Look, ma, I don't love her
Don't listen to her words

I talked to my sister in Memphis
And I told her you were moving to town
Here's her number
She said she'd be glad to show you around
I left a map on your front seat
Just in case you lose your way
But don't worry, once you reach Sallisaw
It's all interstate

But before you do I want you to know, that I

Wish you the best
And I wish you nothing less
Than every thing you've ever dreamed of
And I hope that you find love along the way
But most of all
I wish you'd stay

I figure right about sundown
You'll be in West Tennessee
And by then
Maybe I'll understand why you had to leave

I know that you've done some changing
And I know there's no changing your mind
And yes I know
We've been through this a thousand times

I'm sorry for still holding on
I'll try to let go and I'll try to be strong, and I'll

She said she love me when I'm gone
She miss me being home
I'm always at the studio that makes her alone
Recently she even seems to hate on all my songs
Deleted my pictures took my face up out her phone
Where did we go wrong I'm sitting here thinkin'
She said the weed too strong, it keeps my breath stinkin'
Dizzy high, I ride away in my Lincoln
Close my eyes and fly away but no blinking
I'm just dreaming she ain't really screaming
It goes both ways and I was trying to get even
Lost my whole evening mostly for no reason and
Just my broken weaslin', now I'm trying to ease it in
Came home late I just put the key in
It would probably be straight if she was european
She's not she's hot and mad as she can be
If you can hate on anybody girl I'm glad it was me

I mean it started with the rose petal, ended with the stem
By the car, while I was thinking ""Damn here we go again""
We used to hold hands and had such a deep convo
Make a few plans like you wanna go where I'mma go?
Well let's leave pronto and thats what we did
Then we yelled out geronimo and jumped off that bridge
Had a couple kids, you can move where I live
I know old ass niggas that's scared to do what I did
The shoe still fits but I'm wearing out the sole
Sometimes I really feel as if I'm burning out my soul
I should have a live band preparing for my show
But instead everybody keeps dick riding my flow
Now I know I ain't quite rich, but bitch I ain't broke
If she acting like a bitch, I guess we're around white folk
Forgive me if I raise my voice I won't raise a hand
But one thing I will do baby is raise my little man

All my life I've been searching for something
Something never comes, never leads to nothing
Nothing satisfies, but I'm getting close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope
All night long I dream of the day
When it comes around, then it's taken away
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most
The feeling comes to life when I see your ghost

[Verse 1]
Come down don't you resist
You have such a delicate wrist
And if I give it a twist
Something to hold when I lose my grip
Will I find something in there?
So give me just what I need
Another reason to bleed
One by one, hidden up my sleeve
One by one, hidden up my sleeve

Weight keep pinning me down
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste

Will I find a believer?
Another one who believes?
Another one to deceive?
Over and over, down on my knees
If I get any closer
And if you open up wide
And if you let me inside
On and on, I've got nothing to hide
On and on, I've got nothing to hide

[Verse 1]
Now let's get it all in perspective
For all y'all enjoyment, a song y'all can step with
Y'all appointed me to bring rap justice
But I ain't Five-O, y'all know it's Nas, yo
Grey Goose and a whole lot of hydro
Only describe us as soldier survivors
Stay laced in the best, well-dressed
With finesse in a white tee, lookin' for wifey
Thug girl who fly and talks so nicely
Put her in the coupe so she can feel the nice breeze
We can drive through the city, no doubt
But don't say my car's topless, say the titties is out
Newness, here's the anthem
Put your hand up that you shoot with, count your loot with
Push the pool stick in your new crib
Same hand that you hoop with, swing around like you stupid
King of the town? Yeah, I been that
You know I click-clack — where you and your mens at?
Do the Smurf, do the Wop, Baseball Bat
Rooftop like we bringin' '88 back

[Chorus]
They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas? Where them dimes at?
They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas at? Where them dimes at?

[Verse 2]
This ain't rappin', this is Street Hop
Now get up off yo' ass like your seat's hot
My live niggas lit up the reefer
Trunk of the car, we got the streetsweeper
Don't start none, won't be none
No reason for your mans to panic
You don't wanna see no ambulances
Knock a pimp's drink down in his pimp cup
That's the way you get Timberland'd up
Let the music defuse all the tension
Baller convention, free admission
Hustlers, dealers and killers can move swift
Girls get close, you can feel where the tool's kept
All my just-comin' homies, parolees
Get money, leave the beef alone slowly
Get out my face, you people so phony
Pull out my waist, the Eagle four-forty

[Chorus]
They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas? Where them dimes at?
They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas at? Where them dimes at?

[Verse 3]
I see niggas runnin', yo, my mood is real rude
I lay you out, show you what steel do
Mobsters don't box, my pump shot obliges
Every invitation to fight you punk-asses
Like Pun said: you ain't even en mi clasa
Maybach Benz, back seat, TV plasma
Ladies lookin' for athletes or rappers
Whatever you choose, whatever you do
Make sure he a thug and intelligent too
Like a real thoroughbred is
Show me love, let me feel how the head is
Females who's the sexiest is always the nastiest

You don't need to bother;
I don't need to be
I'll keep slipping farther
But once I hold on
I won't let go 'til it bleeds

Wish I was too dead to care
If indeed I cared at all
Never had a voice to protest
So you fed me shit to digest
I wish I had a reason;
My flaws are open season
For this, I gave up trying
One good turn deserves my dying

You don't need to bother;
I don't need to be
I'll keep slipping farther
But once I hold on
I won't let go 'til it bleeds

Wish I'd died instead of lived
A zombie hides my face
Shell forgotten
With its memories
Diaries left
With cryptic entries

You don't need to bother;
I don't need to be
I'll keep slipping farther
But once I hold on
I won't let go 'til it bleeds

I'll keep slipping farther

Bad Misses, Throwing raspberry kisses on me
You looking for directions?
Girl I feel your vision on me
Just don't let him see you sweat'n
And we ain't suppose to be involved
Knowing when we get it off, Girl I mean it all
Keeping you fiending 'til you taking it tossed
And when I'm breaking it off
Its no denying the fact it's wrong
Cause you got a man who's probably playing his part
You probably breaking his heart
He trying to figure the reason you gon'
Is it because he's superficial
Or is he too submissive
Or did I come along and hit you with the futuristic
Or is it cause you really couldn't see a future with him
All he about is paper, never took the time with you to listen
You want it gripped up, flipped, and thrown
And get stripped and shown, the way to get in the zone
The cost, dealing with this you won't be takin' a loss
You need to leave him alone
And roll with the one who's breaking you off

Brother down the hall
The one you bound to call
Workaholic so really I'm rarely around at all
What we started got serious repercussions in court
We had a chance to turn back, but love that was long
Late nights, twistin' somethin' listenin' to niecey sing
She got the beefy, you tellin' me you deeply appreciate the company
The time we spend 'I feel the same; It's a shame you ain't my girlfriend'
Cause listen: you need a brother with that physical fix
That come through in a mix for you with no head tricks or fraud
You need a new position, somethin' to get you open like its Eucalyptus got you ready to go for your's
Come on and work wit' meh', you won't get hurt wit' meh': Just keep it real and you'll get broken off certainleh' (certainly)
Dealing with this you won't be takin' a loss; you need to leave I'm alone and roll with the one whose breakin' you off

Rollin' down the highway, listenin' to Sade sing the way the smooth operator move my way
You sitting beside me
Looking like Friday Foster
Pam Grier structure look at your body
Keep each other thirsty
Kisses like Hershey
But lips is sealed
Cause we don't need the controversy
I say I'm in town, You say you want it in the worst way
You probably told your man it was your it was ya lil's birthday
Meanwhile, Its champagne chilling in ice
You ready for the freakiest things you done in ya life?
We breaking down like we Road dogs pullin' a heist
You making sounds like the vibe got you reaching your heights
Prepare for flight, this is your captain
I'm getting strapped in
Theres no denying the strength
Of'dis attraction, girl
Working with this you won't be taking a loss
So stop fooling your man and roll with the one
Who's breaking you off

Thought she'd roll with bad boys forever in many ways

Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo

[Verse 1]
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over—blaow!
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

[Verse 2]
His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on: da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

[Verse 3]
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option—failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

And called me names

Before he went off to war
But I just shook his hand
And I wish I had gone to church on Sunday morning
When my grandma begged me too
But I was afraid of God
And I wish I would've listened when they said Boy
You're going to wish you hadn't
But I wouldn't

There was this red dress she wanted one time so bad
She could taste it
And I should have bought it'
But I didn't

She loved to be held and kissed and touched but I didn't do it

Crack a 40 when the sun go down
It's a cold winter, y'all niggas better bundle up
And I bet it be a hotter summer, grab a onion
Just to rock it down; you hot now, listen up
Don't you know cops' sole purpose is to lock us down?
And throw away the key
But without this drug shit your kids ain't got no way to eat, huh
We still try to keep mom, smilin'
Cause when the teeth stop showin'
And the stomach start growlin' then the heat start flowin'
If you from the hood, I know you feel me (keep goin')
If a sneak start leaning and the heat stop workin'
Then my heat start working, I'mma rob me a person
Catch a nigga sleeping while he out in the open
And I'mma get him (keep flowin')
We gotta raise our kids while we livin'
Make a million off a record, bail my niggas outta prison
Fuck a Bentley or a Lexus, just my boys in the squadder
Nigga talk reckless then I hit 'em with the Smif 'n
But I'm never snitching, I'm a rider
If my kids hungry, snatch the dishes out ya kitchen
I'll be wilding til they pick me outta line-up
(Even though what we do is wrong)
We keep the nines tucked, chopped dimes up, rap about it
Wild out, fuck niggas up, laugh about it
I'm not trying to visit the morgue
But Freeway move out 'til I sit with the Lord
'Til I, get my shit together, clean up my sins
Freeway got it in like 10 in the morning
And I can get it to ya like 10 while you yawning mang
(Even though what we do is wrong)
Still deliver the order mang
And I ain't talking bout chicken and gravy mang
I'm talking bout bricks of yayo, halves and quarters
Fou and a halves of hash, you do the math
Swing past us, scoop up your daughter
She wanna roll with a thug that rap, you do the math

Hov never slacking mang, zipping in the black Range
Faster than the red ghost, getting ghost wit' Pac-Man

Bang like T-Mac, ski mask air it out
Gotta kill witnesses 'cause Free's beard's sticking out
Y'all don't want to witness shit, we squeeze hammers mang
Bullets breeze by you, like Louisiana mang
But I gotta feed Tianna mang

[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel]
You, know, B. Sige in the third lane
Gramps still praying, working on my nerves man
Like, ""Son you gotta get your soul clean
Before they blow them horns like Coltrane""
But still I cry tears of a hustler
Wipe tears from my mother, pour out beers for our brothers
That's above us, make beds for the babies
Tuck kids under covers, buy cribs for their mothers
Shit I'll probably be wilding with their fathers
Tell Ms. Robert, tell Anajmah that I'm riding for her father
That's like my brother, like same mother, different father
Any problems dawg, know I got 'em
And still we grind from the bottom
Just to make it to the bottom, sold crack in the alleyways
Still gave back Marcy on Dollar Day
Real gangstas make hood holidays
They ain't thank us but we still paid homage mang
Soul Food Sunday looking like Big Momma's mang
Tell the gang I never break my promise mang
Mang, uhh!

351,I'd Rather,"[JANIS]
So your best friend screwed you over
Acted nice when she not nice
Well, I have some advice
‘Cause it’s happened to me. Twice

Here’s my secret strategy
It always works because
The world doesn’t end
It just feels like it does

So raise your right finger
And solemnly swear
""Whatever they say about me
I don’t care!""

I won’t twist in knots to join your game
I will say, ""you make me mad.""
And if you treat me bad
I’ll say “you’re bad”

And if I eat alone from this moment on
That’s just what I’ll do
‘Cause I’d rather be me
I’d rather be me
I’d rather be me than be with you

We’re supposed to all be ladies
And be nurturing and care
Is that really fair?
Boys get to fight, we have to share

Here’s the way that that turns out
We always understand
How to slap someone down
With our underhand

So here’s my right finger
To how girls should behave
'Cause sometimes what’s meant to break you
Makes you brave

So I will not act all innocent
I won’t fake apologize
Let’s just fight and then make up
Not tell these lies

Let’s call our damage even
Clean the slate till it's like new
It’s a new life for me
Where I’d rather be me
I’d rather be me
Than be with you

[JANIS]
I'll say, ""NO!""

[FEMALE STUDENTS]
NO!

[JANIS]
I’ll say, ""knock it off, with your notes
And your rules and your games.""
And those sycophants who follow you
I’ll remember all their names

And when they drag you down
Like they inevitably do
I will not laugh along with them
And approve their palace coup
‘Cause that’s not me

[FEMALE STUDENTS]
Janis! Janis! Janis! Janis

[JANIS]
I don’t need their good opinions
I have plenty of opinions
Everybody has opinions but it doesn’t make them true
What’s true is being me

[JANIS & FEMALE STUDENTS]
And I’d rather be me
I’d rather be me than be with you

[JANIS]
So raise them high ‘cause playing nice and shy is insulting my IQ

Yeah! Yeah! Yeah

361,Red Rag Top,"[Verse 1]
I was twenty and she was eighteen
We were just as wild as we were green, in the ways of the world
She picked me up in that red rag top
We were free of the folks and hiding from the cops
On a summer night running all the red lights
We parked way out in a clearing in a grove and the night
Was hot as a coal burning' stove
We were cooking the gas we were had to last

[Chorus]
In the back of that red rag top
She said please don't stop

[Verse 2]
Well the very first time her mother met me
Her green-eyed girl was a mother to be for 2 weeks
I was out of a job and she was in school
Life was fast and the world was cruel

We were young and wild
We decided not to have a child
So we did what we did and we tried to forget
And we swore up and down
There would be no regrets
In the morning light
But on the way home that night

[Chorus 2]
On the back of that red rag top
She said please don't stop
Loving me

[Verse 3]
We took one more trip around the sun
It was all make believe in the end
No I can't say where she is today
I can't remember who I was back then
Well, you do what you do and you pay for your sins

And there's no such thing as what might've been
That's a waste of time; drive you outta your mind
I was stopped at a red light just yesterday
Beside a young girl in a cabriolet
And her eyes were green
I was in an old scene

Left your grass out in the yard all last night?""

Absolutely unpredictable, yes she is
She's so different and that's what's wonderful, oh yeah

She had a tattoo above her ankle of a trident submarine
She said it symbolizes awesome powers hidden deep within our dreams
And her diamond eyes, different in color, held me captive in their light
And she said ""Hey, man did you know we used to be brothers

Cigarettes in the ashtray
Reminiscing on those past days
I thought you’d end up with my last name
But that changed
And I travelled around the world
Think where you living at now?
I heard you moved to Austin
Got an apartment and settled down
And every once in a while, I start texting
Write a paragraph, but then I delete the message
Think about you like a past time
I could cry you a river, get you baptized or
I wasn't ready to act right
Used to always think I'd get you back, right
They say that things fall apart
We were gonna move to Brooklyn
You were gonna study art
Love is just a tool
To remind us who we are
And that we are not alone
When we're walking in the dark

[Chorus: Jess Glynne & Dan Caplen]
I hope someday we'll sit down together
And laugh with each other about these days, these days

[Verse 1]
My heart thump
Not from being nervous
Sometimes I'm thinking God
Made me special here on purpose
So all the while, 'til I'm gone
Make my words important
So if I slip away, if I die today
The last thing you remember won't be
About some apple bottom jeans
With the boots with the fur
Maybe how I dream of being free since my birth
Cursed, but the demons I confronted would disperse
Have you ever heard of some shit so real
Beyond, from the heart, from the soul, you can feel

[Chorus]
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
But please don't cry
Just know that I have made these songs for you
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
'Cause I'm ready for the funeral

My mind runs
I could never catch it
Even if I got a head start
God please help me
I am feeling so alone, wait
I don't need to worry
'Cause I know the world'll feel this, nigga
Blessing in disguise, but
I am not hiding who I am, open your eyes, bruh
If I ever met you, I appreciate the love, yo
Girls that I dated, it's okay, I am not mad, yo
Unless you stabbed me in the heart, no love ho
The shit is so ill
Play it back from the top if you recognize real

And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
But please don't cry

[Verse 3: Toni Braxton]
I would have bet the Dow Jones
If then compared to our fun, yeah
Imagine how crushing it was
For you to say I was not the one
(I didn't mean it girl, sorry bout that)
My friends say I was in denial
Defendin' you as a perfect friend
Now new rumors have risen up (psst psst psst psst psst)
It's you again...
Now all I can say

[Chorus: Toni Braxton + (Pharrell Williams)]
Farewell my lonely one
Nothing else that can be done (So hit the freeway!)
I don't ever wanna see you again (sing it girl)
You didn't do me right so
So long, goodbye, goodnight (So hit the freeway!)
Maybe in some other life, I'll see you again (bridge)

[Bridge]
Now that you've left me
Crazy you upset me
You only could have kept me
But maybe you didn't get me
Oh, to pioneer, discove
Explore and cover, the world as we know it
But you had to go and blow it!

[Verse 4: Toni Braxton]
Damn, it's been so long since I head your voice last summer
To be honest it made me smile when I seen you number
(Hey baby, you know I miss you, ha-ha)
Baby tell me why I should reconsider being your friend
Maybe some day in your dreams my love
You could say, ""damn it's you again""
Now all I can say

Farewell my lonely one (Farewell)

Top down, chrome spinning
You see the boss grinning, I'm loving these damn women
I let two get in, she tried to let the rest fit in
I'm like, ""Naw love, that's forbidden""
I ain't for squishing, that's a problem to the wheel well
Trust I know them 20's real well
Now we coasting, me, two chicks and toasting
I turn up the volume, watch the bass get 'em open
Soft spoken, with a wild side
I love 'em in the ride, they lovin' the ride
We was moving bodies before we hit the party
Before the DJ started cutting (I was already fucking)
Cinderella'd you girls; from nothing to something
Hit the parking lot, hear the club system thumping
Lose the face, you two's was great
But it's to the V.I.P., I got new moves to make

Smoke something, drink something, get ripped
And make the girls in the party just strip

How many chicks can you fit in that ride?
Put 'em up, homie (Get, get down!)

[Verse 2: Malice]
Hey, it's just a day in the life
Club nights, one of the reasons I love life
Chicks be in the back tipsy
We gets in for free—""Ay, they with me""
Two stepping, you see each crew repping
Slipping on the floor, mirrors and walls is sweating
Shorty in my ear say she got a thong on
And I love how she move any time a song on
I like that ma, you do something to me
Come this way and prove something to me
Fast or slow, she got the right moves
And I got the right dough for any date that I choose
I'm open, but naw, I don't lose focus
If the shit jump off, you know the thing that I'm toting
But I'm only here to party, y'all
Carry every weekend like it's Mardi Gras

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
When they say, ""Last call"", it don't mean the night's over
It mean it's time for her to show ya
How quick she can hop out those Gucci loafers
Pin her ass to the sofa and attack the chocha
S&M chick, asked Pusha to choke her
But I thought about how rich I am and said, ""No sir""
Chick was crazy, gave her crazy space
What did it? The whip appeal or my baby face?

[Verse 4: Malice]
The night's still young and I'm already leaning
Cruise through the lot on the deuce-two's gleaming
The liquor in me and I don't need a reason
Obnoxious with the women, hot tucked in the linen
I pull up, let her get in, she know from the beginning
She added to the list of them chicks that I done been in
Her head spinning and my head spinning
Mine from juice and gin and hers from neck and chin and
I'm a winner, man

382,Gimme The Light,"[Olli Banjo]
Just gimme the Light!
Uh! *Drama Monks*
Meine Leidenschaften bedeuten der Welt ein Dreck!
Meine Leidenschaften...

[Verse 1 - Olli Banjo]
Ich bin nicht einfach zu handlen
Ich bin ein Freigeist mit Flausen und Eigenheiten in dreifacher Menge
Ich fühl mich oft einsam
Ich drohe an der Oberflächlichkeit der Menschheit zu zerbrechen, es macht das Loch weiter
Ich sitz zwischen zehn Menschen
Nicht ein einziges Themengebiet tangiert mich im geringsten, ich sehe leere Menschen
Ich bring mich ein mit dem Satz ""Fick die Welt!"", die Runde staunt
Ging es doch eben noch um Nettogehälter und Kundentausch
In einem Raum voller naturalistischer Stillleben
Bin ich verstörende moderne Kunst, keiner will mein Bild sehn!
Sie sehn mich wie Dadaismus ohne Idee dahinter, dumm und menschlich
Abstrakt im besten Fall interessant, aber unzugänglich
Ich sprenge ihre Werteskala, ich bin der Härtefall
Ich gehe nicht zum Trendfriseur, hab deswegen heut nichtsmehr zu sagen
Eure Herzen sind mir zu klein, Motive wertentladen
Die Tüten zu groß und die Witze zu vorhersehbar!
Ihr zwingt mir den Komplex auf, die Mehrheit macht den Staat
Ihr besetzt den Begriff normal, alternatives wird brandgemarkt
Um eure Fehler mir auf die Fahnen zu schreiben
Fehlt es mir leider an Arroganz..

[Hook - Olli Banjo]
Just Gimme the Light!
Es is nass und dunkel hier
Ich bin allein und kann nichts sehn
Just Gimme the Light!
Wo sind all die Lichter hin?
Wo sind die Menschen die mich verstehn?
Just Gimme the Light!
Es ist düster und dunkel hier
Ich bin allein und ich kann nichts sehn
Just Gimme the Light!
Ich will ans Tageslicht
Ich will die Sonne noch einmal sehn!
Just Gimme the Light!

[Verse 2 - Olli Banjo]
Warum guckt ihr mich so an? Ich bin nicht aussetzig
Ich bin anti, kontra, dagegen, ich bin aufsessig
Ich bin mein eigenes Konzept, ich lebe freimündig
Mein Leben sind Profis, in der Kreisklasse, Bayern München
Ihr wärt gerne V.I.P., very important
Bist du im geborgten Porsche important?
Kommt in meinen Club zum seelischen Bypass
Und ich sperr extra für euch den geistigen Bereich ab
Ich grab unter feuchte Hände, Schütteln und Kinnhaken
Eine Nische zwischen Großstadtbauern und Provinzadel
Ihr seid Katalogmenschen, Seele kommt per Nachnahme
Als Bonus für lästige Werte der passende Sargnagel
Ich sehe leere Menschen, leere Zimmer, leere Häuser
Leere Millionäre, leere Flaschen, leere Säufer
Ich leere ohne was zu lesen meinen Posteingang
Ich fühl mich oft wie ein Außenseiter, ich bin oft einsam

[Hook - Olli Banjo]

[Verse 3 - Schivv]
Die letzte Frage: Worum gehts?
Und alles seh'n, denn die Wege ensteh'n beim geh'n
Und das versteh'n beim drüber Reden und Schreiben, Reisen und Leben
Statt leiden, schweigen und quäl'n, eigentlich wenig
Doch eigentlich mein' ich mehr nicht
Zumindest weiß ich nichts, deswegen reichts mir eigentlich
Alles ist gut, solange du tust was du kannst
Und mit dem was du in der Hand hast
Und wo du bist mit dir im Frieden bist
Denn da gehts lang, man muss nur anfangen
Ich schalt das Licht an, seh dein Bild
Mich dann und fühl mich ganz an
Ey un ich hass nich wirklich Rechtsanwälte
Doch ich kann spür'n echte Kälte
Schlechte Wellen, schlechte Quellen, schlechte Werte
Und ich bin sicher, echte Stärke heißt nicht ungereche Härte
Darum bleib ich sicher nett mit dir und mir, weils mir das Wert ist
Und weil es ist, wie es ist und weil es war, wie es war
Und schließlich kommt, wie es kommt
Ist alles wahr, rein und klar
Aber echt und ich bleib weit mehr, als rechts, links, dunkel und hell
Denn wir sind alle echt schöne Kinder
Punkt, und so speziell...

What more can I say?
He wanted her, she'd never tell
Secretly she wanted him as well
But all of her friends stuck up their nose
They had a problem with his baggy clothes

[Chorus]
He was a sk8er boi, she said, “See you later, boy”
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face, but her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to earth

[Verse 2]
Five years from now, she sits at home
Feeding the baby, she's all alone
She turns on TV, guess who she sees
Sk8er boi rocking up MTV
She calls up her friends, they already know
And they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along, stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down

[Chorus 2]
He was a sk8er boi, she said, “See you later, boy”
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar, slammin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?
He was a sk8er boi, she said, “See you later, boy”
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar, slammin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?

[Bridge]
Sorry, girl, but you missed out
Well, tough luck, that boy's mine now
We are more than just good friends
This is how the story ends
Too bad that you couldn't see
See the man that boy could be
There is more than meets the eye
I see the soul that is inside

[Breakdown]
He's just a boy and I'm just a girl
Can I make it any more obvious?
We are in love, haven't you heard
How we rock each other's world?

[Chorus 3]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
I'm with the sk8er boi (Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
I said, ""See you later, boy"" (Yeah, yeah, yeah!)

[Verse 1: Ja Rule, Bobby Brown & Both]
I know you're living your life faithfully, safely, away from me
But you miss being next to me, don't you?
Don't let her love haunt you, lust for what you want
Go for your guns and back out on anyone who tries to interfere
Or intervene
Of me peeling your wide body out of them tight jeans
Wrist on freeze, see it's on me
Shoes 19, coming through in that new Bentley thing (GIRL!!)
The talk of the town, the tease of the city (yeah)
You and I make headlines like Lo and Diddy or Bob and Whitney (WHO?)

Sweet thing, living it
Won't you let me let you live it a little bit
I know a stressful relationship is hard to deal with
But here's how to deal with it
On your weekly visits
Use a code name to protect the innocent (ha)
Maybe I'm too generous
Generally believing that all women want me
They don't wanna get even (girl, I know)
But who do you believe in
Is it money or God?
Betrayal, trust, this thing of ours  (GIRL!!)
Should be secretly held sacred, 'cause I love it when you pop your body-body
And move your body-body
Drink up on the Bacardi and rub up alongside me
I love to see you wild and free
But occasionally you get cold wet feet
And all that it means to me is you need my heat (Ja!)
'Cause when it's said and done you're gonna want me
Loving, thugging you, baby...

Rule, baby
Baby girl, here I'm holding your love hostage
The ransom for you, sugar, be priceless (WOOOO!!!)
'Cause you been getting at me in many a ways
Now tell your man to watch his back and duck from strays
'Cause I been in a rage (GIRL!!) lately (yeah)
Hoping God'll forgive me for all the sin, all the women
All the drama I been in and it's just the beginning (WOOOO!!!)
I hope you (watch) so you could see that nigga ain't built like me (like me)
Black Sheep of the family
But we one in the same, that's why we get along
Freak off and get it on
When we make love looking something like soft porn
Now tell me, baby, do you really wanna go home to him?
Where the brightest of days just look dim
And you fucking with a loser, baby, you can't win (HA, HA)

True baby for I adore

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
This is hard to say
I wanna make sure I go about this in the right way
Cuz lately I been busy a lot
And I know you don’t feel appreciated and what not
I used to tell you that you’re hair looked fly
Kiss you slow and stare in your eyes
Now I talk real foul and slick
Every other sentence is, “You make me sick”
Back in the days I was your number one pick
Now your heart’s half-broken and that’s hard to fix
I had to dig deep inside myself
Cuz I can’t see you bouncin’ with somebody else
It’s a long journey back to the place we was
When I was too embarrassed to admit I was in love
And you was my good girl that wouldn’t give it up
I can’t let us self-destruct

[Chorus: Marc Dorsey]
Baby smile today
Cuz I been imaginin’ more ways
I’m gon’ luv U better
When your friends’ll see you too
Just when you think there’s nothin’ else I can do
I’m gon’ luv U better

[Verse 2: LL Cool J]
When I think about the things we did
And I think about you having my kids
And I think about us sharing a crib
Losin’ all that, God forbid
You deserve flowers and candy, the simple things
In addition to the SL’s, baguettes and rings
Instead I walk around like I’m a king
And having you ain’t nothing but a thing
I even stopped tellin’ you the lovin’ was good
Too busy frontin’ in the hood
Baby girl, hold me tight don’t ever let go
I’mma do it real gentle baby, nice and slow
One more chance baby and don’t say no
Cuz I got another side to show
Some say love is painful it helps you grow
Well it’s time for the pain to go, ya’know

[Chorus: Marc Dorsey]
Baby smile today
Cuz I been imaginin’ more ways
I’m gon’ luv U better
When your friends’ll see you too
Just when you think there’s nothin’ else I can do
I’m gon’ luv U better

So let’s laugh together, cry together
God willin’ we gon’ die together

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
It’s a brand new me, a brand new you
A brand new day, sky so blue
Hold my hand while I walk with you
Sit on my lap, lemme talk to you
No more games callin’ you foul names
Actin’ like females is all the same
I’m gon’ love you better, my mentality changed
From this day forward I’ll never be the same
I’mma rub your lower back, share my dreams
I love you, lemme show you what I mean
Give you the deepest love a girl ever seen
Watch you sleep, so peaceful and serene
A toast to the queen, you’re back in my life
But this time I’mma do it right
Trust me, from the bottom of my heart
Nothin’s gonna tear us apart, promise

From your colorful face
It's kind of weird to me
Since you're so fine
If it's up to me, your face will change

And got them cornrows to the back

But if you give me somethin, it's got to be the sticky
Green by the ounces, low-lows bouncin

Ooh to the ouch and, Moet fountain
That's how we get down at the Doggy Dogg House'n

You dont wanna catch a body, you came here to party
Now that's what you should do, now where's my baby boo? (ooh!)

392,Single For The Rest Of My Life,"[Verse 1:]
Ho...oh...
Oh, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah
Ooh, ooh
Oh, yeah, yeah

Sitting here
Daydreaming about you
Oh, everything we had
Wish I could get it back

‘Cause if it ain’t you
Then I don’t want it
And if it ain’t you
Then it ain’t for me

I can see your face
Whenever I be sleeping
But it hurts when I realize I’m dreaming

[Chorus:]
So if I can’t have you
I’ll just be single or the rest of my life (My life)
‘Cause you can’t be replaced by nobody else
I’ll go crazy if I can’t have you for myself (If I can’t have you)

If I can’t have you (I’ll be)
I’ll just be single for the rest of my life
I’ve decided that
Nobody could compare to you (Nobody)
There’s nobody that can make me feel the way you do
(Oh)

[Verse 2:]
There’ve been a few
Who’ve tried to take your place
I’ve been on many dates
Still it just ain’t the same

If it's not a letter sent from you
Then I don’t read it
If it’s not a gift sent from you
Then I don’t need it

I’ve been longin’ just to find
Somebody like you
But nobody can just do it quite like you
If I

[Chorus:]
So if I can’t have you
I’ll just be single for the rest of my life
‘Cause you can’t be replaced by nobody else
I’ll go crazy if I can’t have you for myself (I’ll go crazy)

If I can’t have you
I’ll just be single for the rest of my life
I’ve decided that nobody could compare to you

There’s nobody that can make me feel the way you do

[Bridge:]
I took your pictures off the wall
That didn’t seem to help at all
So I’mma put it out there
I’mma let you know
If you need to rest your head
You can come back home

I thought that I could live without your love
You know I tried
But I feel incomplete when
I don’t have you in my life

So I’mma put it out there
I’mma let you know (Let you know)
If you need to rest your head
You can come back home (Come back home)

[Repeat Chorus x4:]

Nobody can make me feel like you do
Oh, no, nobody
Can make me feel the way you do",Isyss,2003,"[100, 95]",2
393,I Care 4 U,"[Intro]
Mmm yeah..
Oh yeah oh..

[Verse 1]
Hey my baby
Why you lookin' so down?
Seems like you need a lovin'
Baby you need a girl like me around
Hey my baby
Tell me why you cry
Here take my hand and (Yeah, mmm)
Wipe those tears from your eyes

[Chorus x2]
Can I talk to you
Comfort you

[Verse 2]
Hey sexy baby
Why'd your girl leave you in pain?
To let a fine man like you go
She must be insane
Hey sexy baby
There's no need to worry
Oh boy if you call on me
I'll come, I'll come in a hurry

[Chorus]
Can I talk to you
Comfort you
Let you know
I care for you

I care for you (I care for you)

[Chorus]
Can I talk to you (I, I wanna talk)
Comfort you (I wanna hold you tight, baby)
Let you know (I wanna let you know that-)
I care for you (That I care, for you)
Can I talk to you",Aaliyah,2003,[59],1
394,Somewhere Out There,"Last time I talked to you
You were lonely and out of place
You were looking down on me
Lost out in space
We laid underneath the stars
Strung out and feeling brave
I watched the red orange glow
I watched you float away

Down here in the atmosphere
Garbage and city lights
You've gone to save your tired soul
You've gone to save our lives
I turned on the radio
To find you on satellite
I'm waiting for this sky to fall
I'm waiting for a sign
And all we are
Is all so far

You're falling back to me
You're a star that I can see, yeah
I know you're out there
Somewhere out there
You're falling out of reach
Defying gravity, yeah
I know you're out there
Somewhere out there

Hope you remember me
When you're homesick and need a change
I miss your purple hair
I miss the way you taste
I know you'll come back someday
On a bed of nails I'll wait
I'm praying that you don't burn out
Or fade away
And all we are
Is all so far

You're falling back to me
The star that I can see, yeah
I know you're out there
Somewhere out there
You're falling out of reach
Defying gravity, yeah
I know you're out there
Somewhere out there

You're falling back to me
You're a star that I can see
I know you're out there
Oh
You're falling out of reach
Defying gravity
I know you're out there
Somewhere out there

You're falling back to me
You're a star that I can see, yeah
I know you're out there
Somewhere out there
You're falling out of reach
Defying gravity, yeah
I know you're out there
Somewhere out there

You're falling back to me
I know , I know
You're falling out of reach
I know",Our Lady Peace,2003,[84],1
395,These Are The Days,"[Verse 1]
No keys on the table
Mama says it's bad luck
Walking through the doorway
I'm already looking up
One hand on the future
One hand on today
Although I know leaving ain't easy
I'm on my way

[Pre-Chorus]
All the days gone by with no fire in my eyes
I'm ready for a flame to come
Need to chase these lights
While my youth is on my side
So I pick up my feet and away I run

[Chorus]
Step back onto the road
And the troublemaker's back in the fold
I hear familiar voices calling me on
They say ""son, you've been away for too long""
Cause these are the days, these are the days
These are the days
Cause these are the days, these are the days
These are the days

[Verse 2]
Fresh air in the morning
Blood rushing at night
As long as I keep moving
Then everything'll be alright
The devil's in my system
And I've got to get it out
I've been waiting forever
For heaven to come on down

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus]

[Bridge]
These are the days, these are the days
These are the days
These are the days, these are the days
These are the days

[Chorus]",Zak Abel,2003,[98],1
396,Every River,"[Verse 1]
Once upon a time
Somewhere in your past
Someone said forever
But that promise didn't last
Now you don't believe
Love is ever true
Steel yourself against the day
When I stopped loving you

[Chorus]
When the day comes that I don't love you
Every star will fall out of the sky
And every mountain will tumble down
And every river run dry

[Verse 2]
Every drop of rain
That ever touched the ground
For every tear that ever fell
And never made a sound
I'll be there
To hear you call
And I'll be there to catch you baby
Should you ever fall

[Chorus][x2]",Brooks & Dunn,2003,[99],1
