1,You Light Up My Life,"[Verse 1]
So many nights
I'd sit by my window
Waiting for someone
To sing me his song

So many dreams
I've kept deep inside me
Alone in the dark
But now you've come along

[Chorus]
And you
Light up my life
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights
With song

[Verse 2]
Rolling at sea
Adrift on the water
Could it be finally
I'm turning for home?
Finally, a chance
To say, ""Hey, I love you,""
Never again
To be all alone

[Chorus] x2

2,Blue Bayou,"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I feel so bad I got a worried mind
I'm so lonesome all the time
Since I left my baby behind
On Blue Bayou

[Pre-Chorus]
Saving nickels, saving dimes
Working till the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times
On Blue Bayou

[Chorus]
I'm going back someday
Come what may
To Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fine
And the world is mine
On Blue Bayou

[Post-Chorus]
Where those fishing boats
With their sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise
Through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be

[Verse 2]
Gonna see my baby again
Gonna be with some of my friends
Maybe I'll feel better again
On Blue Bayou

[Pre-Chorus]
Saving nickels saving dimes
Working till the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times
On Blue Bayou

[Chorus]
I'm going back someday
Come what may
To Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fine
And the world is mine
On Blue Bayou

[Post-Chorus]
Where those fishing boats
With their sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise
Through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Oh that boy of mine
By my side
The silver moon
And the evening tide
Oh some sweet day
Gonna take away
This hurting inside

Well I'll never be blue

3,(Every Time I Turn Around) Back In Love Again,"Every time I move, I lose
When I look I'm in
And every time I turn around
I'm back in love

I get mixed emotions
It's the way my feelings flow
Excuse me I'm only human
Sometimes I, I just don't know

Every time I move, I lose
When I look I'm in
And every time I turn around
I'm back in love again

(Do, do, do, do, do)
Back in love again
(Do, do, do, do, do)
Back in love

When you put your arms around me
I feel so satisfied
I want to love you forever
I just can't, I can't decide

Every time I move, I lose
When I look I'm in
And every time I turn around
I'm back in love again

(Right back, right back in love again)
Alright
(Seems like, seems like)
Back in love again

Now it's your lover
I know it's hard just to be a friend
That's something else I discovered
I guess, I just don't ever want it to end

Every time I move, I lose
When I look I'm in
And every time I turn around
I'm back in love again

(Right back, right back in love again)
(Seems like, seems like)
That I'm back in love again
(Right back, right back in love again)
Alright, I'm back in love again
(Seems like, seems like)

I just don't believe it
Back in love again
(Right back, I'm back)
I can't believe it
(Right back, I'm back)
Every time I turn around
Back in love again
(Right back, I'm back)

I get so many mixed emotions
I'm back in love again
(Right back, I'm back)
Every time I turn around
Oh, my love, Jones coming down
Back in love again
(Right back, I'm back)

4,It's So Easy,"[Verse 1]
I see your sister in her Sunday dress
She's out to please, she pouts her best
She's out to take, no need to try
She's ready to make

[Chorus]
It's so easy, easy
When everybody's trying to please me, babe
It's so easy, easy

I make the fire, but I miss the firefight
I hit the bullseye every night

It's so easy, easy
When everybody's trying to please me, babe
It's so easy, easy
When everybody's trying to please me

You think you're so cool
Why don't you just
Fuck off

5,Baby Come Back,"[Verse 1]
Spendin' all my nights, all my money goin' out on the town
Doin' anythin' just to get you off of my mind
But when the mornin' comes, I'm right back where I started again
And tryin' to forget you is just a waste of time

[Chorus]
Baby come back, any kind of fool could see
There was somethin' in everything about you
Baby come back, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong and I just can't live without you

[Verse 2]
All day long, I'm wearin' a mask of false bravado
Tryin' to keep up a smile that hides a tear
But as the sun goes down, I get that empty feelin' again
How I wish to God that you were here

[Chorus]
Baby come back, oh baby, any kind of fool could see
There was somethin' in everything about you
Baby come back, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong and I just can't live without you, oh

[Bridge]
Now that I put it all together, oh-oh
Give me the chance to make you see
Have you used up all the love in your heart?
Nothing left for me? Ain't there nothing left for me?

[Chorus]
Baby come back, oh darling, any kind of fool could see
There was somethin' in everything about you
Baby come back, listen baby, you can blame it all on me
I was wrong and I just can't live without you
I was wrong and I just can't live",Player,1977,"[6, 6, 8, 11, 13, 17, 38, 42, 47, 50, 55, 68, 80, 90]",14
6,Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue,"Don't know when I've been so blue
Don't know what's come over you
You've found someone new
And don't it make my brown eyes blue

I'll be fine when you're gone
I'll just cry all night long, say it isn't true
And don't it make my brown eyes blue

Tell me no secrets, tell me some lies
Give me no reasons, give me alibis
Tell me you love me and don't let me cry
Say anything but don't say goodbye

I didn't mean to treat you bad
Didn't know just what I had
But honey now I do
And don't it make my brown eyes

7,Here You Come Again,"[Verse 1]
Here you come again
Just when I'd begun to get myself together
You waltz right in the door
Just like you've done before
And wrap my heart 'round your little finger

[Verse 2]
Here you come again
Just when I'm about to make it work without you
You look into my eyes
And lie those pretty lies
And pretty soon I'm wondering' how I came to doubt you

[Chorus]
All you got to do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messing' up my mind and filling' up my senses

[Verse 3]
Here you come again
Looking' better than a body has a right to
And shaking' me up so that all I really know
Is here you come again
And here I go

All you got to do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messing' up my mind and filling' up my senses

Looking' better than a body has a right to
And shaking' me up so

8,Sentimental Lady,"[Verse 1]
You are here and warm
But I could look away and you'd be gone
'Cause we live in a time
When meaning falls in splinters from our lives
And that's why I've traveled far
'Cause I come so together where you are

Yes, and all of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you

9,Slip Slidin' Away,"Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away

I know a man
He came from my home town
He wore his passion for his woman
Like a thorny crown
He said Dolores
I live in fear
My love for you's so overpowering
I'm afraid that I will disappear

Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away

I know a woman
Became a wife
These are the very words she uses
To describe her life
She said a good day
Ain't got no rain
She said a bad day's when I lie in bed
And think of things that might have been

Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away

And I know a fa-ther
Who had a son
He longed to tell him all the reasons
For the things he'd done
He came a long way
Just to explain
He kissed his boy as he lay sleeping
Then he turned around and headed home again

Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away

God only knows
God makes his plan
The information's unavailable
To the mortal man
We work our jobs
Collect our pay
Believe we're gliding down the highway
When in fact we're slip slidin' away

Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away

Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away",Paul Simon,1977,"[10, 10, 13, 15, 17, 22, 26, 30, 35, 45, 63, 81]",12
10,You're In My Heart (The Final Acclaim),"[Verse 1]
I didn't know what day it was
When you walked into the room
I said hello unnoticed
You said goodbye too soon
Breezing through the clientele
Spinning yarns that were so lyrical
I really must confess right here
The attraction was purely physical
I took all those habits of yours
That in the beginning were hard to accept
Your fashion sense, Beardsley prints
I put down to experience
The big bosomed lady with the Dutch accent
Who tried to change my point of view
Her ad lib lines were, well rehearsed
But my heart cried out for you

[Chorus]
You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend
You're in my soul

[Verse 2]
My love for you is immeasurable
My respect for you immense
You're ageless, timeless, lace and fineness
You're beauty and elegance
You're a rhapsody, a comedy
You're a symphony and a play
You're every love song ever written
But honey, what do you see in me?

[Chorus]
You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend
You're in my soul

[Verse 3]
You're an essay in glamour
Please pardon the grammar
But you're every schoolboy's dream
You're Celtic, United, but baby I've decided
You're the best team, I've ever seen
And there have been, many affairs
Many times I've, thought to leave
But I bite my lip and turn around
Cause you're the warmest thing, I've ever found

[Chorus]
You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend
You're in my soul
You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend
You're in my soul
You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend

13,Come Sail Away,"[Verse 1]
I'm sailing away
Set an open course for the Virgin Sea
'Cause I've got to be free
Free to face the life that's ahead of me

On board I'm the captain, so climb aboard
We'll search for tomorrow on every shore
And I'll try, oh Lord I'll try to carry on

[Verse 2]
I look to the sea
Reflections in the waves spark my memory
Some happy, some sad
I think of childhood friends, and the dreams we had

We lived happily forever, so the story goes
But somehow we missed out on the pot of gold
But we'll try best that we can, to carry on

[Pre-Chorus]
A gathering of angels appeared above my head
They sang to me this song of hope, and this is what they said

[Chorus]
They said: Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me baby
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me

I thought that they were angels, but to my surprise
We climbed aboard their starship, we headed for the skies

Singing come sail away, come sail away, come sail with me lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me

I was a fool for your love
From the moment I saw you
Like a vision in the darkness
Of a thousand lonesome, lonely nights
Like my heart threw away the key

I stand accused
I'm in league with the forces of darkness
An incurable believer
In the magic of the midnight sky
And the love that I found today
Oh, I can't let it slip away
Oh darlin', can't you read between the lines

Hey Deanie
Won't you come out tonight
The stars are dancin'
Like diamonds in the moonlight

Deanie, love is all there is
I don't wanna lose it
Don't wanna let the evenin' go
If it's here within our reach
I think we should use it
Now while we're young enough

15,We're All Alone,"[Verse]
I am your hero still I sleep alone at night
In years you'll thank me for getting everything right
I am the sun still I sit alone in a red sky
Keeping my eyes on you
Keeping my eyes on you
We're all alone
In time you'll find that
We're all on our own (All on our own)
We're all on our own, chasing nothing
My dreams have fallen, I'm wearing thin
I need something to fill this void I'm constantly in
And I can't do this
I am your hero and I just don't care tonight
In years you'll forget me, I got everything right
I am the sun and I didn't rise today
I left you in darkness

[Bridge]
And I just don't care anymore about you
You can sit and suffer alone without me

[Pre-Chorus]
I am your hero
Save your ""Thank you""'s
I am your hero
Save your ""Thank you""'s

[Chorus]
In times to come, I'll rise above this
But for now, I'll just sit here

17,We Are The Champions,"[Verse 1]
I've paid my dues

I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through

I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
I thank you all
But it's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
And I ain't gonna lose
(And I need just go on and on, and on, and on)

18,Runaround Sue,"[Produced By: G-Eazy]

[Intro: Dion]
Here's my story, it's sad but true
It's about a girl that I once knew
She took my love, then ran around
With every single guy in town

[Hook: Greg Banks]
She played with my heart, made me question, if I was insane
Sue's the prettiest girl in town but she's venom to your veins
Heartbreak hotel room, 505
I was blinded by love, and the way she lied
Not me, no way, but that day she fooled me
When I caught Sue running around
She was running around, she was running around, she was running around
She was, she was running around

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Um, so I said ""Peace!,"" and I left it
Can't get mad at me when your actions request it
Couldn't even tell me to my face, had to text it
You can pack your bags, follow signs to the exit
Yes, move it along please, pronto
Oh, and by the way, return your keys to the condo
If you played at the Apollo
You'd be the type of act that I would boo off stage
While I throw you a tomato
A tough act to follow, but you fooled me, bravo
Can't believe I fell for your bull, Chicago
Can't believe you asked me to stay, nah, hoe
I'm outta here with rocket power, babe, Otto

[Hook: Greg Banks]
She played with my heart, made me question, if I was insane
Sue's the prettiest girl in town but she's venom to your veins
Heartbreak hotel room, 505
I was blinded by love, and the way she lied
Not me, no way, but that day she fooled me
When I caught Sue running around
She was running around, she was running around, she was running around
She was, she was running around

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Well, I should've known she would run around
Chill for a second, then peace when the Summer's down
Now, how dumb I sound, ever since I fell for the apple of my eye?
Cupid always keeps his gun around
When I smash, she was like a woman from the past
A Mary Tyler Moore with more ass
Should've figured something when she let me score fast
But I was misguided, thinking she had more class
Nah, I couldn't be wronger
Fuck it anyways, it was time to move onward
I'm tripping no longer
Put her on the streets like a Banksy
'Cause I was too swanky, and she was too skanky

[Hook: Greg Banks]
She played with my heart, made me question, if I was insane
Sue's the prettiest girl in town but she's venom to your veins
Heartbreak hotel room, 505

19,Short People,"[Intro]

Short people got no reason
Short people got no reason
Short people got no reason
To live

They got little hands
And little eyes
And they walk around
Tellin' great big lies
They got little noses
And tiny little teeth
They wear platform shoes
On their nasty little feet

Well, I don't want no short people
Don't want no short people
Don't want no short people
Round here

Short people are just the same
As you and I
(A fool such as I)
All men are brothers
Until the day they die
(it's a wonderful world)

Short people got nobody
Short people got nobody
Short people got nobody
To love

They got little baby legs
And they stand so low
You got to pick 'em up
Just to say hello
They got little cars
That go beep, beep, beep
They got little voices
Goin' peep, peep, peep
They got grubby little fingers
And dirty little minds
They're gonna get you every time

Well, I don't want no short people
Don't want no short people
Don't want no short people

You are this dreamer's only dream
Heaven's angel, devil's daughter

[Verse 1:]
Say, my mind
Should I go with her on silent nights
She'll drive me crazy in the end
And I should leave this paradise

But I can't leave her
While I need her more
Than she needs you
That's what I'm living for

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
Say, my thought
Should I find out she don't care at all
She'll leave me crying in the end
Wandering through the afterglow

But I can't leave her
While I need her more
Than she needs you
That's what I'm praying for

[Repeat Chorus x2:]

32,Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood,"[Verse 1]
Baby, you understand me now?
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad

[Chorus]
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please, don't let me be misunderstood

[Verse 2]
You know sometimes, baby, I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And then sometimes, again, it seems that all I have is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side

[Chorus]
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please, don't let me be misunderstood

[Verse 3]
If I seem edgy
I want you to know
I never meant to take it out on all you
Life has its problems
And I get more than my share
But that's one thing I never mean to do

[Bridge]
'Cause I love you
Oh baby, I'm just human
Don't you know I have faults like anyone?
Sometimes I find myself alone, regretting
Some little foolish thing
Some simple thing that I've done

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please, don't let me be misunderstood
I try so hard, don't let me be misunderstood
I try so hard, don't let me be misunderstood",Lana Del Rey,1977,"[33, 33, 36, 38, 50, 61, 74, 88, 91]",9
33,Point Of Know Return,"I heard the men saying something
The captains tell they pay you well
And they say they need sailing men to
Show the way, and leave today
Was it you that said
""How long, how long?""

They say the sea turns so dark that
You know it's time, you see the sign
They say the point Demons Guard is
An ocean grave, for all the brave
Was it you that said
""How long, how long
How long to the point of know return?""

Your father, he said he needs you
Your mother, she says she loves you
Your brothers, they echo your words:
""How far to the point of know return?""
""Well, how long?""

Today I found a message floating
In the sea from you to me
You wrote that when you could see it
You cried with fear, the Point was near
Was it you that said
""How long, how long

But I can't remember now

And I've swallowed every lie
But I can't remember how

My life went down the wishing well
In my head I say I wish you well
But from my tongue I say...

Well I know I must be right
You've stolen all the light
You're a killer and a con
And I cannot understand
For my love you give me sand
And a rope to hang me on

My life went down the wishing well
In my head I say I wish you well
But from my tongue I say…

Desiree, do not go away
Desiree, do not go away
Desiree, do not go away

I can't listen to the people who tell me I am blind
I can't look up to the steeple and pray I see the light
I can't take another needle
I can't noddle through the night
You can take this sting away so I won't have the need to say...

Up in Harlem, down on Broadway
You're no tramp but you're no lady
Talkin' that street talk
You're the heart and soul of New York City

And love
Love is just a passing word
It's the thought that you had
In a taxicab that got left on the curb

Because I love you (Yes, I do)

It turns me inside out

Sent down to break my heart

39,Sometimes When We Touch,"You ask me if I love you
And I choke on my reply
I'd rather hurt you honestly
Than mislead you with a lie
And who am I to judge you
On what you say or do?
I'm only just beginning to see the real you

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you til I die
Til we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides

Romance and all its strategy
Leaves me battling with my pride
But through the insecurity
Some tenderness survives
I'm just another writer
Still trapped within my truth
A hesitant prize fighter
Still trapped within my youth

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you til I die
Til we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides

At times I'd like to break you
And drive you to your knees
At times I'd like to break through
And hold you endlessly

At times I understand you
And I know how hard you've tried
I've watched while love commands you
And I've watched love pass you by
At times I think we're drifters
Still searching for a friend
A brother or a sister
But then the passion flares again

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you til I die
Til we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides",Dan Hill,1977,"[40, 40, 50, 64, 75, 86]",6

You've got me feeling emotions
Ayy, higher
Ahhhhhhh
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh

Don't link me
Don't hit me when you hear this and tell me your favorite song
Don't tell me how you knew it would be like this all along
I know the truth is you won't love me until I'm gone
And even then the thing that comes after is movin' on
I can't even capture the feeling I had at first
Meetin' all my heroes like seein' how magic works
The people I look up to are goin' from bad to worse
Their actions out of character even when they rehearse
Workin' in the land of the free, the home of the brave
I gotta bring my brothers or else I feel out of place
Breakin' speed records on roads that these niggas paved
And they don't like that, it's written all on they face
I don't know how I'ma make it out of here clean
Can't even keep track of who plays for the other team
Iconic duos rip and split at the seams
Good-hearted people are takin' it to extremes
Leavin' me in limbo to question what I believe
Leavin' me to ask what's their motive in makin' peace
Leavin' me to not trust anybody I meet
Leavin' me to ask, is there anybody like me?

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh, ayy

[Verse 2: Drake]
Missin' out on my years
There's times when I wish I was where I was
Back when I used to wish I was here
Missin' out on my days
Scrollin' through life and fishin' for praise
Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways
I try and see who's there on the other end of the shade
Most times it's just somebody that's underaged
That's probably just alone and afraid
And lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain
I always hear people complain about the place that they live
That all the people here are fake and they got nothin' to give
'Cause they been starin' at somebody else's version of shit
That makes another city seem more excitin' than it is
I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome
Then she finally got to Rome
And all she did was post pictures for people at home
'Cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known
I know another girl that's cryin' out for help
But her latest caption is ""Leave me alone""
I know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone
I know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown
To post later and make it look like she still on the go
Look at the way we live
I wasn't hidin' my kid from the world
I was hidin' the world from my kid
From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate
Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate
Breakin' news in my life, I don't run to the blogs
The only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call
They always ask, ""Why let the story run if it's false?""
You know a wise man once said nothin' at all
I'm exhausted and drained, I can't even pretend
All these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch
All these followers but who gon' follow me to the end?
I guess I'll make it to the end and I'ma find out then

[Outro: Mariah Carey]
You've got me fe–

Play chief, get shot with a stray arrow
You suckers imitate more rappers than Jay Pharoah
Rockin' gay apparel, them jeans'll make you sterile
I'm steady stockin' the ammo and cockin' the double barrel
Rock a show hard as an army of Viking warriors
Stormin' your little village then pillage 'til we victorious
Stories of us painted on the walls of caves
An image of your bitch suckin' on my balls for days
I'm like Genghis Khan on the back of a horse
Or Billy Joel with a bottle of Jack on the dash of the Porsche
Blast with the force of Soviet Rockets in cold wars
You're on tour baggin' whores with cold sores
Do the wisdom, fuck bitches to the rhythm
I'm hard as nuclear fission, a student of pugilism
Which means Ap'll knock your motherfuckin' head off
I'm logical like Spock, drink vodka like Chekov

Meet me on a rap tour and a raptor might bite your face (grr)
And what would happen is you'll get shipped out in packages
Thank God I keep the meat tenderizer in my cabinet
But truthfully (what?), my vision varies
I go from a visionary to a vicious leader of killer militaries
Usin' old machine guns, why I need better gats?
These’ll still burn holes in motherfuckers like a treasure map (Blat!)
Think that Celph's soft, and I'mma just stare at y'all
'Cause I'm Cyclops, and yes the sunglasses are off (ah)
So get a bulletproof armor suit and chin guard
Army surplus galore, I’m throwin' more than ten darts (yeah)

I break through all barriers trust Ap’ll bury ya
Nowadays rappers sound like cartoon characters (Hilarious)
Raps I write cover an area where paragraphs are larger than aircraft carriers

Swearin' yeah my middle finger express my hand gesture (Fuck you)
You a she-man dressed in a dress like Fran Drescher
Cro-Magnon with a crowbar, I might eat you
Pro with a Magnum, keep you in check like Nike sneakers

I’m white as wife beaters on white trash on cop shows
Sellin' stolen Picassos in front of Costco's
This is the Demigodz gospel
Unholy and hostile, acidic apocalyptic apostles

Pop those snot-nosed thugs who act
Mail-order a gun and they afraid to pop the bubble wrap
My gun powder’s dusting 'em, my guns and them is troublesome
My Glock alone is like a foster home 'cause I be sonnin' 'em

Ehi
Giorni dove non temo niente
Giorni dove o te o niente
Giorni dove non mi alzo neanche
Giorni dove non parlo neanche
Giorni come la notte
Torni come stanotte
Libero come un leone, yah
Libero come liane
Notte e giorno dal letto
Non mi muovo dal letto
Sono in cima al mio letto
Anche se cigola il resto
Come cado mi ci sballo come in corso
Con le tavole nell'atrio di ritorno
Dalla classe col mio pranzo dignitoso
Alla cattedra era un attimo, mi ricordo
L'ultimo ciao non ce lo diamo chattando
L'ultimo bacio sa di quanto ci odiamo
L'ultimo addio stavo da Dio, che bugiardo
L'ultima siga sa di quanto ci amiamo
Fammi luce senza LED, siamo ombre da rompere
Dubito non plani come rondini, rompi le ali
Le ali, rompi le ali

Day 'n' night
Non era mica notte lì a Shanghai
Mi scrivi: ""Buonanotte"" e poi che fai?
Mi lasci in mutande come Walter White
Prima mi vuoi bene e poi non me la dai

Hai mai visto uno schiavo diventare re
Dormire in strada e svegliarsi in un king size bed?
È successo questo Big Bang
Vesto e non conosco questo brand
E non voglio stare one man show
Tu sei la mia fuga, tu sei il mio day off
Questi soldi non mi chiedon come sto
Tanto meno se ho mangiato o no

Just got myself free
Oh yeah
Baby what you want from me?

To change over night?

Tried to find the one

How'd you let him get away from you?
I could be walking
Years ago
No one knew my name
Watch out now
How do I know?
Nothing but what I am
This is the picture
I don't know why
I don't know why I bother
But you tried to love
I tried to find the one
You'll love forever

By you're wasting your time

47,If You're Not Back In Love By Monday,"Verbal intro

You can call Mrs. Johnson to
Keep the kids for a day or two
Take the early flight to Florida
Just the way you used to do

Have room service bring you breakfast
Make love all through the day
If you're not back in love by Monday
Then you go your separate way

If you're not back in love by Monday
You can't say you didn't try
But before you bury your love
Just make sure you let it die

Sleep a few more nights together
Say the things that you used to say
And if you're not back in love by Monday
You just go your separate way

You can find that little cafe
With the funny sounding name
Get the corner by the window
Tell him you love him once again

If the disco dj's still there
Go on, dance til the break of day
If you're not back in love by Monday
Then you go your separate way

If you're not back in love by Monday
You can't say you didn't try
But before you bury your love
Just make sure you let it die

Oh, oh, go on
Sleep a few more nights together
Say the things that you used to say
If you're not back in love by Monday

Hermès link could feed a village in Liberia

Momma see me on BET and started tearin' up
I'ma start killin' niggas, how you get that trife?
I attended Harlem picnics where you risked your life
Uncle used to skim work, sellin' nicks at night
I was only 8 years old, watching Nick at Nite
Uncle Psycho was in that bathroom buggin'!
Knife to his guts, hope Daddy don't cut him
Suicidal thoughts brought to me with no advisory
He was pitchin' dummy, sellin' fiends mad ivory
Grandma had the arthritis in her hands, bad!
She was poppin' pills like rappers in society
I fuck yo bitch for the irony
I'll send Meechy at yo ho if yo bitch keep eyein' me

Indian burns all up on a nigga wee-wee
I think I need a foursome, Bella, Kendall, Gigi
It'd be easy if Reneezy hook it all up on the leezy

52,How Can I Leave You Again,"Di di di di di la la la la la la
In a spaceship over the mountains
Chasing rainbows in the setting sun
Leaving heart and home for the city of angels
I feel my life is undone

There are pathways winding below me
In pleasure I've gone where they go
In the quiet stillness I can hear symphonies
The loveliest music I know

How can I leave you again
I must be clear out of my mind
Lost in a storm I've gone blind
Oh, how can I leave you again

Oh, it's been a long time since I've listened
Still longer since I've walked with you
For the first time I know what I'm missing
Some answers are no longer true

So I question the course that I follow
I'm doubtful and deep in despair
My heart is filled with impossible notions
Can it be you no longer care?

Still, I ride on the wings of a high wind
Blowing steady and strong behind me
As the clouds surrender my fate is for certain
I'm a sailor who runs to the sea

How can I leave you again
I must be clear out of my mind
Lost in a storm I've gone blind
Oh, how can I leave you again",John Denver,1977,"[53, 53, 64, 75, 86, 90]",6

I'm going back to a place that's far away
How bout you, have you got a place to stay?
Why should I care when I'm just trying to get along?
We were friends, but now it's the end of our love song

So let's leave it alone, 'cause we can't see eye to eye

Original they never will be
We bumpin' from coast to coast, yeah yeah
We just tryin' make you see
Nobody does it better

[Verse 1: Warren G]
I'm sittin' here trippin', my mind is blocked

No one can do it better like this two man crew
Hey say we one-hitter quitters, now what cha'll gonna do?

[Verse 2: Nate Dogg]
Always into somethin, that's my name
Only out for money, hey cause that's the game

Strike one, me and Nate Dogg is a match
Stike two, leave 'em standing still in their tracks
Strike three, you can call us two one three
It's the L and the B that makes me act like a G

Do you remember back on the east side?
When all of us niggas used to love to ride
We didn't care what we did
Time was nothing to us, we were just kids
Times are different now, but you still get stuck

Opening doors
Finally knowing
The one that I wanted was yours

Making my entrance again
With my usual flair
Sure of my lines
No one is there

My fault, I fear
I thought that you'd want what I want
Sorry, my dear

But I'm hopin' that this love song
Will help me find a way, to say

What are you doin' for the next hundred years
Where are you gonna be tomorrow
Who's gonna wipe away your now and then tears
Which rainbow leads you into your dreams

And if you're lonely on a dark rainy day
How are you gonna share the sorrow
Where will you turn when you want someone to say
It's not as bad as it all seems

You're gonna need someone to help you get through
To understand, take your hand
To keep on loving you

I'd love to love you for the next hundred years
I wanna share you joy and sorrow
I'd wipe away all of your now and then tears
If only I could be part of your dreams

You're gonna need someone to help you get through
To understand, take your hand

선물 꾸리듯 포장한 맘을 설렘에 연다면

누군가를 만나고 싶다가도
혼자인 게 너무 편해서 좋아
나도 모르겠어 내 마음을

지루해진 일상 속
나를 깨워줄 뭔가를 찾고 싶은데 whoa

누구라도 있었음 좋겠어
외롭다 생각하다 가도
돌고 돌아야 하는 길이 아득해

I waited all night
Smoked a hundred cigarettes
I chewed my lip 'til it bled
But the phone made not a sound

Sometimes, I wonder
If you ever wonder, what's become of little old me
But I ain't no baby, I ain't gonna cry but baby
You don't know what's going on inside me

[Chorus 1]
You know you make me crazy
What you do to me
It's a chemical reaction or an allergy
You know you make me crazy
You're aware of that
Why don't you come and put me away?

It was a long night
I could barely keep my head
I heard a knock on the door
It was only Harry Jones

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I used to wonder
What it is that makes me feel like I can't be free
'Cause you don't give me nothing
You never give me nothing
But you know what's going on inside me

[Chorus 2]
You know you make me crazy
I'm in misery
Are you interested enough to see what's left of me?
You know you make me crazy
You're aware of that
Why don't you come and put me away?

You know you make me crazy
What you do to me
It's a chemical reaction or an allergy

You scared me
The way you move in the night
Your face is something frightening
You're not so nice

Who you spend your time with
Everywhere you go and what you see
I know, I'm not your daddy
I don't want to be your daddy

67,Breakdown,"[Verse 1]
Yeah
Yeah

Look, I just shed tears homie and no I ain't too proud to admit it
Just seen my father for the first time in a minute
When I say a minute I mean years man
Damn, a whale could have swam in them tears fam
Cause as I left em' I reflected on my younger days
When it was just me and my brother and my mother played
Father, ‘cause no other man bothered
Not even my biological, it never seemed logical
But I accepted it 'cause I ain't know no better
Thought I was brighter than a Polo sweater
No pops was like Martin with no Coretta
So many things you could have told me
And saved me the trouble of letting my mistakes show me
I feel like you barely know me
And that's a shame ‘cause our last name is the same
That blood type flowing through our veins is the same
My mama left you and it may be that anger's to blame
But that's no excuse, only you and God know the truth
And why you only call monthly, barely ever saw me
Spend some summers with you and played with my cousin Maury
Maybe I should be telling you “fuck you” ‘cause you selfish
But I want a father so bad, I can't help but...

Break down
I break down
Can't help but break down
I break down

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I never thought I'd see my mama on that shit, man
It's fucking with her body, now she sick, damn
I wanted a big house with a white picket fence and a pool
Who would have ever thought that it would come to this, man?
Quicksand is what this life feel like
That shit these rappers kick is nothing like real life
You made a milli off of serving hard white? Yeah right
My mama tell you what addicted to that pipe feel like
Stupid niggas, I heard the cops be shooting niggas
I swear to God, wish I could bulletproof my niggas
Can't get no jobs, but they still recruiting niggas
We trying to stand tall when it get too crucial niggas

Break down, we break down
We break down, we break down
Break the break down

[Verse 3]
Yeah, He's serving time, locked down
And she don't want nobody to know
His daughter 25 pounds
By the time he get out, she gon' be 4
Now will his girl stay down?
Ain't no doubt she love him, yeah that's for sure
But temptation stays round
And if she strayed, how could he ever know? Never know
And so, she goes to the club on the weekend
A little freaking, but them niggas holla, but she never speakin'
But tonight I see the devil creeping
'Cause she been lonely, she ain't felt a man in seven seasons
Damn! She doin the best that she can
Her mama tellin' her to find another man
She college educated with a felon boyfriend
That's what she thinkin' tonight
Maybe she's right, but please

Stay down mama
Gotta be strong, don't break down mama
Please
Stay down mama
Gotta be strong, don't break down mama
Don't break down
Yeah, don't break down
Don't break down
Don't break down

Somewhere else to go

That I never thought I would
But I believe you really ought to know

I love you
I honestly love you

You don't have to answer
I see it in your eyes
Maybe it was better left unsaid

This is pure and simple
And you must realize
That it's coming from my heart
And not my head

I love you
I honestly love you

I'm not trying to make you feel uncomfortable
I'm not trying to make you
Anything at all

But this feeling
Doesn't come along everyday
And you shouldn't blow the chance
When you've got the chance to say

I love you
I honestly love you

If we both were born
In another place and time
This moment might be ending in a kiss

But there you are with yours
And here I am with mine

So little of you

You touched my soul with your beautiful song
You even had me singing along right with you
You said I need you

Then you sang the song you had written for me
To someone new

And you try to stay young, but the songs are sung
To so many people who've all begun
To come back on you

Sing your song, sad music man
Making' your living doing one-night stands
They're through with you
They don't need you

I've fought my wars and now they're won
And I didn't need nobody's gun

Agreed we kissed goodnight

Maybe we're colder

While we cling to our illusions once again

Oh, reasons are changing
But the story isn't ending
So we find ourselves pretending one more day
Oh, while the years keep slipping away

Don't you hear the rock 'n' roll playing on the radio
Sound so right?
Girl your better grab hold
Everybody's got to know
Anything that's rock 'n' roll's fine [x2]

I'm a little bit crazy

I want to it right now

I never had
And, baby, I can feel the change in me
But you can't say how long
You'll stay around
I guess I'll just have to wait and see

Nobody said it was easy
To get the love that you need
But the one who is givin'
Is the one who receives

Oh, honey, don't let
Don't let the flame burn out
These nights of sweet emotion

Don't let
Don't let the flame burn out
Words are softly spoken

Don't let
Don't let the flame burn out
Hearts are lost and stolen

Don't let it burn out
Don't let it burn out
Don't let it burn out

I know I'm helpless
Where you're concerned
I see the danger that lies ahead
There's so many reasons
You're on my mind
Should I believe the thing you've said?

Nobody said it was easy
To get the love that you need
But the one who is givin'
Is the one who receives

Oh, honey, don't let
Don't let the flame burn out
You're the one and only

Don't let
Don't let the flame burn out
I need you to hold me

Don't let
Don't let the flame burn out
When you're away I'm lonely

Don't let it burn out
Don't let it burn out
Don't let it burn out

No, no, don't
Don't let the flame burn out
Ooh, honey, don't

96,Just Remember I Love You,"When it all goes crazy and the thrill is gone
The days get rainy and the nights get long
When you get that feelin' you were born to lose
Staring at your ceiling thinkin' of your blues

When there's so much trouble that you wanna cry
The world has crumbled and you don't know why
When your hopes are fading and they can't be found
Dreams have left you waiting, friends have let you down

Just remember I love you
And it'll be alright
Just remember I love you
More than I can say
Maybe then your blues will fade away

When you need a lover and you're down so low
Start to wonder, but you never know
When it feels like sorrow is your only friend
Knowing that tomorrow you'll feel this way again

When the blues come callin' at the break of dawn
Rain keeps fallin', but the rainbow's gone
When you feel like crying but the tears won't come
When your dreams are dyin', when you're on the run

Just remember I love you
And it'll be alright
Just remember I love you
More than I can say
Just remember I love you
And it'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright",Firefall,1977,"[97, 97, 63, 55, 37, 29, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 22, 26, 30, 32, 37, 41, 52, 62, 73, 84]",21
97,Draw The Line,"Seems like the more
I think I know
The more I find I don't
Every answer opens up so many questions

Anarchy sounds good to me
Then someone asks, 'Who'd fix the sewers?'
'Would the rednecks just play king
Of the neighborhood?'

How many liberators
Really want to be dictators?
Every theory has its holes
When real life steps in

So how do we feed
And make room for
All the people crowded on our earth
And transfer all that wealth
From the rich to those who need it?

[Chorus:]
Where do ya draw the line?
Where do ya draw the line?
Where do ya draw the line?
I'm not telling you I'm asking you

Ever notice hard line radicals
Can go on star trips too
Where no one's pure and right
Except themselves?

'I'm cleansed of the system.'
('Cept when my amp needs electric power)
Or-'The Party Line says no
Feminists can't wear fishnets.'

You wanna help stop war?
Well, we reject your application
You crack too many jokes
And you eat meat

What better way to turn people off
Than to twist ideas for change
Into one more church
That forgets we're all human beings?

[Chorus]

In Toronto someone blew up
A cruise missile warhead plant
10 slightly hurt, 4 million dollars damage

Why not destroy private property
When it's used against you and me?
Is that violence?
Or self-defense?
You tell me

Does your head ever give you trouble?

Hang on, help is on its way
I'll be there as fast as I can
""Hang on"", a tiny voice did say
From somewhere deep

Surrounded by illusion?
Sort it out, you'll make out
Seem to make a good beginning
Someone else ends up winning
Don't seem fair

Leaves them dazed- half crazed - in her wake

With a perfect duet
I'm sharp as a razor blade that covers Gillette
I'm under your neck
You think that you're better than Prince then I'll come to your set
That wasn't a threat
I would have dubbed over your tape if it was a cassette
From the west of Gwinnett
I'm one of the dopest rap niggas you ever done met
I'm smoking that Shrek
With a sexy brunette on a jet and she giving me neck
Get plenty of sex
The way I be dressing they calling me vinaigrette
They say I'm too fresh, in fact
A general you just a cadet
So show me respect
Cydel get mail faster than Pony Express
They owe me a check
My only regrets
Is not checking these niggas with phoney baguettes
Claiming they on the block
Juking like Tony Dorsett
But I know that's a lie, man, they can't do what I can
I'm from the Middle East, you ain't ran the streets that I ran
From Paris to Chicago
Atlanta back to Thailand
They yell the same thing every time I finish rhyming

But I'm on Mars like Bruno, so gone on Pluto
On an old brawn with a new ho
I tell her roll up and she do so
Black chick, her pussy pink like Nuvo
I don’t choose, I get picked like the drummer in The Roots fro
Trend setter with a vendetta
With people fucking up Prince cheddar
Grew up tougher than Benz leather
More stripes than a Twins catcher
It's hard to be a real nigga
When there's niggas who pretend better
But I just keep my eyes on the buck like Jim Tressel
Take your bitch to the crib
Lay back then I'll bench press her
Had the streets in a full nelson
Couldn't tell me I didn't wrestle

They business minded, but they in the wrong line of biz
Cause they busy minding mine instead of minding theirs

Got some Ciroc, you know what kind it is

Let me test that head out, I wouldn’t mind a quiz

Separation from what we know is right

Carry the weight of thousands of years
Turn the page, let's make it all disappear
We've had enough of inhibited progression
Held back by cloak and dagger oppression

We're insulting our own intelligence
I won't listen without any evidence
I'll live my life in the name of no one
Bow your head, palm to palm
Worship here, in this cerebral cathedral

As day breaks, the sunlight heals
As day breaks, the light reveals
These chains that we've been living in
How easily we've been giving in
Now shed this skin and let change begin

As day breaks, the light reveals

I began wanting to be with you
Wanting to be seen with you
But why I just couldn't say
But after a while
You were my lady and lover
I didn't know what I'd discovered
Until today
And still the loving is fun
Just like it was when it all began
We started out simply two young friends
But look what we've become
And still the loving is fun
Count the years we've loved everyone
And since the first time we loved
The loving's been fun
The loving's been fun
The midnight sun shined all the ways
When I first held your hand
Our feet was slowly sinking into the sand
That ran between our toes
And I couldn't think of one
Single place any better than you
And after all these years
You're still the one
I want my love to know
And still the loving is fun
Just like it was when it all began
We started out simply two young friends
But look what we've become
And still the loving is fun

Where the screams came unattached
Addiction was the latest style
In the faces they could not match

There was a blue beat playing
On the radio left behind
And a man selling lies as truth
Like a king who was loved too much

They made a mess of your only child
Her innocence was not lost
While the judge and jury took their dime
They counted the miles and laughed

Make way for the way we are
The fever still burns though the king is gone

Fever comes to the innocent
It can make you mad and free
But you never find a scrap of love
If you don't wanna feel the heat

A million flames are lickin'
They lie like dogs at your feet
Waitin' for the words of wisdom
From the mouths of the bittersweet

In the valley of indiscretion
Where fear plays the piper's tune
The heroes are the ones who tell the truth
And break the rules with the courage of love

129,On And On,"[Verse 1]
You've been on my mind
I grow fonder every day
Lose myself in time
Just thinking of your face
God only knows
Why it's taken me so long
To let my doubts go
You're the only one that I want

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know why I'm scared
I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine

[Chorus]
I dare you to let me be your
Your one and only
Promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end starts

[Verse 2]
Have I been on your mind?
You hang on every word I say
And lose yourself in time
At the mention of my name?
Will I ever know
How it feels to hold you close?
And have you tell me
Whichever road I choose, you'll go

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know why I'm scared
'Cause I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine

[Chorus]
I dare you to let me be your
Your one and only
I promise I'm worthy, mmm
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end starts

[Bridge]
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
(Nobody's perfect, trust me I've learned it)
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
(Nobody's perfect, trust me I've learned it)
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
(Nobody's perfect, trust me I've learned it)
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
(Nobody's perfect, trust me I've learned it)
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart

[Chorus]
So, I dare you to let me be your
Your one and only
I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can

130,"Changes In Latitudes, Changes In Attitudes","[Intro]

[Verse]
I took off for a weekend last month
Just to try and recall the whole year
All of the faces and all of the places
Wonderin' where they all disappeared
I didn't ponder the question too long;
I was hungry and went out for a bite
Ran into a chum with a bottle of rum
And we wound up drinkin' all night

[Chorus]
It's those changes in latitudes, changes in attitudes
Nothing remains quite the same
With all of our running and all of our cunning
If we couldn't laugh, we would all go insane

[Verse]
Reading departure signs in some big airport
Reminds me of the places I've been
Visions of good times that brought so much pleasure
Makes me want to go back again
If it suddenly ended tomorrow
I could somehow adjust to the fall
Good times and riches and son of a bitches
I've seen more than I can recall

[Chorus]
These changes in latitudes, changes in attitudes
Nothing remains quite the same
Through all of the islands and all of the highlands
If we couldn't laugh we would all go insane

[Verse]
I think about Paris when I'm high on red wine
I wish I could jump on a plane
And so many nights I just dream of the ocean
God, I wish I was sailin' again
Oh, yesterdays are over my shoulder
So I can't look back for too long
There's just too much to see waiting in front of me
And I know that I just can't go wrong

[Chorus]
With these changes in latitudes, changes in attitudes
Nothing remains quite the same
With all of my running and all of my cunning
If I couldn't laugh I just would go insane
If we couldn't laugh we just would go insane
If we weren't all crazy we would go insane

134,The Happy Girls,"Sally met him in the war back in 1944
He took her home to the states
His buddies thought that she was great
Subway Sally's 51
Her man is gone her dreams are done
She rides by night the Brooklyn train
Sleeps by day to hide the pain

Lonely women of the world were the happy girls
Lonely heroes of the world seek the happy girls

Nancy saw him on the street
His shoes were shined, his suit was neat
She couldn't see his broken mind
Behind the mask of being kind
He sleeps inside the iron bars
Nancy's smile can't hide the scars
Her daughter's grown, there's no one home
She cries all night, she's all alone

Lonely women of the world were the happy girls
Lonely heroes of the world seek the happy girls

To tell the truth there's no end in sight
Mr. Lonely always calls at night
Let's hold on tight until the morning light

Terry's gonna meet him soon
Today at school maybe noon
I hope for her it turns out right
I know she's got a date tonight
Had my ups, had my downs
Truth was lost but truth was found
This I've learned the world still turns
We all get bruised, we all get burned

Lonely women of the world were the happy girls
Lonely heroes of the world seek the happy girls

And music is my game

Homeward bound again
To normal ways and lazy days
And old familiar friends

Some love long overdue

Tell me, how do crocodile tears fall from dry wells?

A lil' weed but I might as well have been shooting up
Aim for goals so high they got me shooting up
But chasing dreams ain't for kids who got no time
For looking up to the stars with leaks all in the ceiling, plus
I was chilling, just tryna make me a killing, bruh
I remember Young Tony tales from the hood
I remember teachers never had my name understood, look
Ain't with the back and forth like racquetball or basketball, nah
You doing her bad, she put you on blast like a Kalashnikov, ah
All nighters for med school, tryna crash the course, ah
Same minute I’m medded up on all the Adderall, I
Look in the past and look at the battle scars
Thinking of picking my bags and taking a trip to Californi-yay yay yay
That's why I look in the mirror like I'm the fucking man
'Cause the younger me would probably be a fucking fan
Look who the boy became and I'ma hit the damn
MJ, Michael Jackson Thriller dance
Milly rocking either hand, diddy-boppin' Sweeterman
Trending topic, neither, I don't give a damn
I just wanna see the fam winning off my

Looking in her eyes
Trying to send a message
Getting some replies
Feels like she's looking into my soul
Gotta look away just to keep control

That's what I'm thinking of
Started out dancing
Ended up making love

I wonder
Did she come alone
I wonder
Could I take her home
I wonder if she's looking for
Just a dance or a little bit more

Two us alone now
(I can see her body)
Doing what we feel
(Pushing at her clothes)
Dancing close together
(Dancing up a sweat now)
I can't believe it's real
(Wonder if she knows)

'Cause you were wanting me
While I was wanting you
It's sure good luck when a dream comes true

Started out dancing
Ended up making love
I can't get enough
Started out dancing
Ended up making love

Yeah, feels so good now, baby

Just a little bit more
I want her so bad
(Working to the rhythm)
(Looking in her eyes)
My imagination
(Trying to send a message)
Taking over again

For you, there might a brighter star
But through my eyes the light of you, is all I see
For you, there might be another song
But all my heart can hear is your melody

So long ago my heart without demanding
Informed me that no other love could do
But listen did I not though understanding
Fell in love with one, who would break my heart in two

For you, love might bring a toast of wine
But which each sparkle know the best for you I pray
For you, love might be for you to find
But I will celebrate our love of yesterday

159,The Greatest Love Of All,"(l. creed/m. masser)

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride
To make it easier
Let the children's laughter
Remind us how we used to be

Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need
A lonely place to be
So I learned to depend on me

Chorus:
I decided long ago

Never to walk in anyone's shadow
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I lived as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity
Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
Is the greatest love of all

(repeat 1st stanza and chorus)
And if by chance that special place
That you've been dreaming of
Leads you to a lonely place
Find your strength in love",Lea Salonga,1977,"[70, 44, 38, 24, 25, 27, 31, 35, 39, 42, 46, 54, 89, 94]",14

받아들이는것도 방법이겠지만

Are you listening right now?
Can you hear my heart?
Like the rain drops falling on the window
You enter my heart
I need you, I need you, I miss you

I saved my words in order to forget you
I tell myself that I really forgot
But in the end, I’m talking about you
But I need to forget that I’m trying to forget you
In order to really forget you

[Verse 2: Tablo]
You gotta give me time
I ain’t perfect
But I’m tryin’ to
Erase you perfectly

[Verse 3: Tablo]
We came too far to turn things back
But when I look back, you’re always right behind me
I know
I don’t think I can erase
Because the memories were too perfect
For the imperfect me
But I try again
It’s so much harder to fall out of love
Than to fall in love
You make me live and die again
I’m not alive without you
I’m not alive without you
You know I’d die without you
Don’t forget

Are you listening?
To my voice, to this confession for you?
Are you listening right now?

[Verse 4: Mithra]
Like a summer night shower, it falls
It’ll come again, the shower of memories
I think you need an umbrella
I’m really worried
I can see out the window
The rash lights of the cars, busily going somewhere
Though you already know my final destination
Even if you don’t ask

[Verse 5: Mithra]
All of you that was always in my hands
It transparently smears and my eyes get blurry with tears
When I look back, I’m in the same place
My heart is always heavy
The footsteps of my breakup are slow
If I can’t turn things around
I know one way would be to accept it but
I’m standing here
I’m still standing here

Are you listening?
To my voice, to this confession for you?
Are you listening right now?

We ran the through hills and forests
As two under a spell
He was a city boy, Floyd the outlaw
But I thought I knew him well

Long after that great summer
When I first came into my fame
And the Avenger from Oklahoma
Was added to my name
The Avenger I became

[Verse 1]
Well, they call me Avenging Annie
I'm avenger of womanhood
I spend my whole life telling lies
Lead you on and mess you over good

I take all you spoiled young hippies
Running around, playing games
Mess around in your bed, I'll blow your head
I'll put you through a change
What you've done to others
I'll do unto you

[Verse 2]
And then I met my sensitive outlaw
He was the best thing I had ever seen
I wanna be his wife forgiving my life
I was so blind I could never have seen, no
So I joined up with my outlaw
And headed for California

[Verse 3]
He treated me worse than I ever imagined
He even say he don't want me around
Kept it up so long, I couldn't be strong
He run me right into the ground
After five long years
He picked me up and then he slapped me down

[Verse 4]
When I told my friends about him
They all were on my side
And I could see through the haze he looked so crazy
I put my head right down and I cried
For my poor lover
I cried like a mother for my poor lover

[Verse 5]
Well, I felt so sad about it
But I knew I couldn't do him no good
He was so far gone while standing all alone
I left him, I knew I should
I knew I couldn't do him no good

[Verse 6]
And now I live out on a mountain top
And I'm almost thirty-five
And I've found my peace and I've found my release
And I'm happy just to be alive

And I might go back to my Floyd
If I think it's the thing to do
He gave up murder and theft right after I left
And you know I still love him too

He's the best friend that her husband ever knew
When she's lonely, he's more than just a friend

They don't want to hurt the others
So they love in the nighttime

172,Smoke From A Distant Fire,"You left me here on your way to paradise
And you pulled the rug right out from under my life
I know where you goin' to, I knew when you came home last night
'Cause your eyes had a mist from the smoke of a distant fire

Lord, I was stunned, shoulda seen it come a long time ago
When I realized, the reality gave me a roll
If things are the same, then explain why your kiss is so cold
And that mist in your eyes feels like rain on the fire in my soul

This lyin' and cryin' is upsettin' and gettin' nowhere
It don't stack up, so slack up, then pack up, I just don't care
Don't let the screen door hit you on your way out
Don't you drown when your dreamboat runs onto the ground

I'd just like to know, do you love him or just makin' time
By filling his glass with your fast-flowing bittersweet lime
You'll face the aftertaste when you come home late some night
With your eyes all a-mist from the smoke of a distant fire

Girl, your eyes have a mist from the smoke of a distant fire

On their mind

Does she do it like she dances
Does she do it like she dances
Does she do it like she dances
Dances, dances

Finished up my drink
And was headed for the door
When I saw that lady
Giving me the eye

So we danced the night away

[Verse 1: Clarence the Kid]
9am, it’s a beautiful day
I woke up in the morning so I gotta give thanks
Birds outside my window and they singing away
So I gotta thank the Lord, yeah, I’m giving Him praise
The plants on my windowsill in their regular place
With their leaves stretching out tryna absorb the rays
With the Son beaming down from the heavenly gates
If they can blindly follow then I can for sure do the same
So much thanks be to God, for He gives me the faith
When I’m down He gives me hope to see a brighter day
When I’m lost He gives me light so I can find my own way
When I’m lonely, He’s the homie that makes sures I’m okay
Oh man, I’m so humbled and so lucky He loves me
His glory washes over me like the pebbles in the Truckee
The kinda buddy that will give you butterflies in your tummy
Can’t hide him from me because He’s the only one who knows of me

[Hook 1]
I’m blessed, I’m blessed
Said I’m blessed, I’m blessed
I’m grateful and I’m blessed
Said I’m thankful and I’m blessed
All praise to the most high
He watches over me with a close eye
There is not a single day that goes by
Where I don’t think my God is a dope guy
I woke up each and everyday
And I hop out of bed giving Him all the praise
Giving him all the praise
This is my praise song

[Verse 2: Clarence the Kid]
I walk outside, thank God for the blessings
Left foot, right foot, there’s some bounce to my stepping
I feel invincible, I got the protection
Daddy’s watching over me, I will die by no weapon
I am who I am and I’m fine with me
Wearing bright pink crocs walking down the street
Got cargo shorts and a cheesy tee
I’m just doing the things that make me happy
And my hair’s nappy and my eyes baggy
But I don’t give a damn, I still feel swaggy
There is nothing in the world that I cannot be
There is nothing in the world that can distract me
From chasing dreams, I never thought that I
Could ever be so damn satisfied
But thanks to the man up in the sky
I know everything’s gonna be alright
To be honest I don’t really understand
Why we’re living in a world that’s got so many demands
You gotta get a job, make a couple hundred grand
Get a girl and a car and you still won’t be the man
Like damn, whoever thought that was the truth
Better sit your butt down I won’t listen to you
I spent so much time tryna follow the rules
But in the end I was just sad and didn’t know what to do
You a fool, screw your lesson I got one that’s even better
We were put onto this earth so that we could love one another
Be the butter to the bread, gotta take it all and spread
Get that whole loaf covered and pass it ahead
I’ve stopped taking as much as I actually give
I am finally content, and heaven forbid
I ever fall back to that, no I gotta get rid
Of that negativity, thanks to God I can live

[Hook 1]
Cuz I’m blessed, I’m blessed
Said I’m blessed, I’m blessed
I’m grateful and I’m blessed
Said I’m thankful and I’m blessed
All praise to the most high
He watches over me with a close eye
There is not a single day that goes by
Where I don’t think my God is a dope guy
I wake up each and everyday
And I hop out of bed giving Him all the praise
Giving him all the praise
This is my praise song


[Interlude]
I stand here before you as a God-fearing young man
A young man who knows that with God all things are possible
A young man who knows that God is not dead, he’s very much alive
A young man who knows that prayer changes things
A young man who knows that Jesus saves
A young man who knows that God is the way, the truth, and the light
A young man who loves God with all his heart and soul

I give up hope when every moment goes by
Another night and you’ll be knocking at my window
I wouldn’t answer if I took my own advice
You gave me something that I wanted to believe in
I give up hope when every moment goes by

[Verse 3: Clarence the Kid]
I used to be scared of failure, I used to be scared of demons
I used to be scared of dying, had nothing I could believe in
I was looking for a reason, life shifting like the four seasons
Until I started believing in you
You took me and held me closely I wasn’t even remotely
Aware at our introduction that the Holy Ghost would show me
An entire world of hope because the Lord already knows me
That’s when I started believing in you
I was so messy but my God cooked up a recipe
That would take my mustard seed and grow it into a mustard tree
He saw the best in me and He built me up exponentially
That’s why I stay believing in you
You inspire me and you lovingly embrace me and keep hugging me
The miracles you perform in my life are always stunning me
You were the first one who loved me, so in return I’m loving thee
I’m blessed to be believing in you, yeah

[Hook 2: Emily Hunter]
Another night and you’ll be knocking at my window
Another night and you’ll be knocking at my window
You gave me something that I wanted to believe in
I give up hope when every moment goes by
Another night and you’ll be knocking at my window
Another night and you’ll be knocking at my window
You gave me something that I wanted to believe in
I give up hope when every moment goes by

[Verse 4: Clarence the Kid]
Praise be to the Lord my God
He brought back hope when the hope was gone
He gave me life and he keeps me going
And so he’s the one I devote this song to
He’s the only person that would come through
When I had nobody I could turn to
I let God in and then “Pew”
Now I have a fire that can burn through
Every bit of doubt and fear
I have stopped comparing myself to all my fears
I will not let negativity bring the tears
I’m on top of my game, I can hear all the cheers
Of all the people that support me, my fam
My friends, my God, and all of the fans
In the stands with they hands in the air right here
Let it breathe yeah
Alright we right back in it like we just getting started
Thinking back to 8th grade when I departed
On a journey that would eventually make me an artist
To be honest, never thought that this would happen so I’m honored
And I’m ballin, not like I’m putting the rock through the lace
No I’m bawling, I’m astounded by the depth of the grace
I used to feel so alone, now I feel so at home
No I could not condone my life and so I’ve grown
Into the person that looks back at me from the crystal mirror
Make it crystal clear, I’m happy that I met you
Thank you for the blessings

You're the one that I adore
So please believe me
I could never find the courage
To resist your charm
Nothing's more divine
Than each moment
You are mine

Be My Lady
Just forget the past
It's time to mend your broken heart
No walls divide us now
So dry the tears in your eyes
Nothing can stop us now
I'll give you all I have

Be My Lady
Let the sun shine through heart
And make a brand new start
Stay with me each night and day
Through the rest of my life

My love will last until forever

My love will last forever",Martin Nievera,1977,"[78, 84]",2

LA - here's to you
For being the kind of place a man can do his due

Bumpin' all night long, out on Sunset Strip

And makes him gain a boogie, man

Oh there's another man, he's got a boogie man
And he wants to be the king, of all the land
But his game is weak, and the brother plays for keeps
Cause you can't aim step to the boogie beat
And the way you play the game, let's get funky or spicy man
And the only king of disco men

185,Whatcha Gonna Do?,"[Big Punisher]
Yo, yo, yo, yo...
Yo, yo, yo, yo...
Yo, yo...
It's hard to explain how my squad can harbor the strain
Of being the largest name in rap, since the almighty Kane
Acknowledge the fame, my college terrain was the rugged streets
From Harlem to Queens, back to the Bronx who fathered the dream
Started this thing called rap, where I reign supreme, my team
Regardless of that, I've seen things as far as the crack
That'll make the hardest largest artist heart just collapse
I'm part of all that that's why it's so hard to go back
And start from scratch
I'm locked and I'm trapped, in a giant cage
Tryin to savor these few dyin days
I have left, to the form of flesh; should I lie in my grave
I'm tryin to persuade my mind to try to be brave
And not givin death the satisfaction of seein me dyin afraid
That why I rise from the grave singin church songs like
I was Je-sus Christ pa-rum-pum-pum-pum

And welcome drama (yeah) with open arms and a code of honor
My whole persona equals that of Gods
Definin' matters hard all before you even had a job
I'll stab and rob if I have to, fuck it I'll blast you
Tell the devil it was Pun, if he ask you
And let him know how we be deadin 'em, show him my emblem
The tombstone, the throne, every millennium
A child is born that can preform at a level beyond
The expected four minute thirty second song
We reign supreme, my team be all up in your dream
With the ""kill anything"" grill, chillin' beside the guillotine
Executioner style, black suit and a smile
Who's next to get their neck hacked loose in the crowd
Move from the aisle, don't make me have to prove that I'm wild

The joy and the chaos, the demons we're made of

You locked yourself in the bathroom
Lying on the floor when I break through
I pull you in to feel your heartbeat
Can you hear me screaming, ""Please don't leave me!""

Hold on, I still want you
Come back, I still need you
Let me take your hand, I'll make it right
I swear to love you all my life
Hold on, I still need you

Long endless highway, you're silent beside me
Driving a nightmare I can't escape from
Helplessly praying, the light isn't fading
Hiding the shock and the chill in my bones
They took you away on a table
I pace back and forth as you lay still
They pull you in to feel your heartbeat
Can you hear me screaming, ""Please don't leave me!""

You're a discontented mother
And a regimented wife

I've no doubt you dream about
The things you'll never do
But I wish someone had talked to me
Like I wanna talk of you

Ooohooo, I've been to Georgia and California
And anywhere I could run
I took the hand of a preacher man
And we made love in the sun

But I ran out of places and friendly faces
Because I had to be free
I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me

Please, lady, please, lady
Don't just walk away
'Cause I have this need to tell you
Why I'm all alone today

I can see so much of me
Still living in your eyes
Won't you share a part of a weary heart
That has lived a million lives

Oh, I've been to Nice and the isle of Greece
When I sipped champagne on a yacht
I moved like Harlow in Monte Carlo
And showed 'em what I've got

I've been undressed by kings
And I've seen some things that a woman ain't supposed to see
I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me

Hey, you know what paradise is?
It's a lie
A fantasy we created about people and places as we'd like them to be
But you know what truth is?
It's that little baby you're holding
And it's that man you fought with this morning
The same one you're going to make love with tonight
That's truth, that's love

Sometimes I've been to crying for unborn children
That might have made me complete
But I, I took the sweet life I never knew
I'd be bitter from the sweet

I've spent my life exploring, the subtle whoring
That costs too much to be free, hey, lady
I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me

I've been to paradise
Never been to me

I've been to Georgia and California
And anywhere I could run

[Verse 1]
Don't let this go to your head
But you're the best I've ever had
Not to mention that thing is swollen
You got me oh so in a trance
Something like a ziploc, but a lip lock
Want you wrapped around my arm like a wrist watch
Oh so hard walking out
Got me stuck like krazy glue, ooh

Them lips won't let me go

[Verse 2]
Got me tossing turning in the bed
Your place is where I'd rather be instead
You don't know your strength
Missing you is like adrenaline
Ooh when you got me in a gridlock, what a great spot
With a turned up kind of loving, it just won't stop
No, so hard walking out
Got me stuck like krazy glue, ooh-wee

That hold on tight
Yeah that hold on tight, ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go

Them lips won't let me go

Oh baby, holding back the faces I would make
I'm a fan and you're the rockstar, making it hard on me
Visualise a monster, cause you're too bad for me
Shot that arrow I'm hit, need you right near me

So don't mind if I turn away, no no
I try to maintain
So don't mind if I turn away, ooh

201,The Martian Boogie,"The other night I was
Walking down the street
I was getting kinda hungry
I decided to get me something to eat

Now I passed up all the chain
Franchise joints on Hamburger Row
And stopped at a little greasy spoon place
I always eat at called Eat, Sit and Gulp

Get you one of the greasy hamburgers
All peppered up, lay you up in the
Hospital for ten days

So I ordered me up a
Couple of those grease bombs
Waitress brought 'em over
Lifted up the bun, checked 'em out
Damn, no ketchup

So I nudged the guy sitting next to me
At the counter, I said, ""Hey, partner
How about passing the ketchup over?""

Suddenly, this little bitty green hand
Holding a ketchup bottle came into view
And I freaked cause the guy sitting
Next to me... was a Martian!!

Now in twenty-eight years of eating hamburgers
I ain't never run into no Martian
Not at 2:30 in the morning and certainly
Not at a fine scarfing establishment like Eat

Well, he was sitting over there with a
Bunch of colored sticks on his plate
And I looked over at him and I said
""What you eating there, boy, crayons?""
He said, ""Why no!
They're Martian cigarettes!
Here, try one!""

Well, 'bout half hour later
He looked over at me and smiled
Them ol' Martians ain't got
But two teeth in their head
And he said, ""How do you feel?""

And I said, ""Weeeeeeell, I feel so good
Yeah, I do, gonna boogie
Wow! Til the break of day!""

Meanwhile, back at Eat's
I was stiiiiiiiiiiiiiiill thinking, I said
""How come out of all the places
You could have landed
You ended up here?""

He said, ""Well, according
To my lunar space map
This town here is supposed to be
The boogie capital of the U.S.A!""

So I asked him, I said
""Now, where else you been, boy?""
And he told me

He said, ""I've rocked 'em over
And I've rocked 'em down
Rocked 'em in the country
I've rocked 'em in town
Rock 'n' roll, Memphis on up to Maine
Woke up a lady and she asked my name!
Told her the name was on ten of my shirts
Told her, rocking chair Martian
Don't have to work!""

Yeah, I feel so good
Yeah, yeah, gonna boogie

Good morning Judge
Why do you look so mean, sir?
And Mr. Judge, what can the charges be?
If there's been trouble, I will plead not guilty
It must be someone else
You know it can't be me

I filed my income tax return, thought I'd saved some dough
I cheated just a little bit, I knew they'd never know
I got some money back this year, like I always do
They'll have to catch me before I pay Internal Revenue

Good morning Judge
Why do you look so mean, sir?
And Mr. Judge, what can the charges be?
If there's been trouble, I will plead not guilty
It must be someone else
You know it can't be me

My wife and I we separated, just the other day
Last thing that she said to me was ""Brother, you will pay""
She said I'll pay her every week, I better never fail
I said before I send you a dime, I'll die right here in jail

As strange as it seems
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams

That can be hard to take
I know we've made them fall
But only fools come back for more
Being the fool I am
I figured in all your plans, darling
Your perfumed letters didn't say
That you'd be leaving any day

So you win again, you win again
Here I stand again, the loser
And just for fun you took my love and run
But love had just begun

I can't refuse her
But now I know that I'm the fool
Who won your love to lose it all
When you come back, you win again
And I'm not proud to say
I let love slip away
Now I'm the one who's crying
I'm a fool there's no denying
When will my heartache end?
Will my whole life depend on fading memories

So you win again, you win again

You were my Earth

[Verse 1]
And with a smile like an ocean wave
You catapult around the Sun
And meet me at the other side
To tell me that you found it fun
Swimmin' in the UV rays
You shouted like the sound of thunder
Boomin' through my stupid shades
You shook all of the ground undone
I slipped into your beauty like a mudslide
And on my search, I found nothing but upsides
Your arms extend like branches
Whenever we touch I feel the bark begin to
Soften up at all my sappy punchlines
Maybe that's the reason

[Chorus]
You're my earth
You're the planet
You're the grass
The wind and tides
And now that you're gone
I feel so out of place
And now that you're gone
I'm just driftin' through space
And now that you're gone
I feel so out of place
And now that you're gone
I'm just driftin' through space

[Verse 2]
And when we split up like Pangea
I was hopin' that we could reform
A landbridge between our separate pieces of the Earth
Before our disconnect began to breed a species
That would hurt much more
Than carnivores, herbivores, recklessness or urban swarm
Maybe I could wash up on a certain shore
Smilin' past a long night of drinkin'
And the lights above the island
Watching lightnin' flash every time
You open up your eyelids
Gentle smirks exploding like a fire in the sky
Until you scared away the forest creatures
Sleepin' in the trees
They began to huddle next to me
Weepin' in the leaves
See I watched you change the temperature
Increasin' the degrees
Until the warmth was just enough
To let them nestle into peace
I never thought there'd be
A problem that we couldn't solve
When you control the weather's climate
And the sea levels and all
But I suppose that when an earthquake
Splits the crust above the faults
I shouldn't act as if the damage
Wouldn't break up those involved

[Chorus]
You were my earth
You were the planet
You were the grass
The wind and tides
And now that you're gone

In that skin tight
But you know I come with heartbreak
And the spotlight
And that’s why I gotta go

But there’s somethin’ bout the bad
That makes you feel like
Feeding this addiction
Filling a prescription
You wish you didn’t have

A fine little line between pleasure and pain

Backwards and forwards in sheer delight
What feeds the fire in you
Like a locomotive moving in the heat of the night

I'm a sacrificial lamb on the alter of desire
You got me clutching for a cross
Yeah, the voodoo that you do is lifting me higher
All my senses have been lost

Один мой панч — и весь твой баттл-рэп на сраку присел
Мне нужен только демон: Люцифер, Сатана, Бафомет
Я люблю лишь твою мамку, алкоголь и баттл-рэп
Нахуй всех! Я не хочу палить еблом с билборда
Нужен только Cricket, чтоб спалить к чертям Восточный Мордор
Микстейп? Нет-нет, дисс, он бьёт, как монтировкой по лбу
X, Y, Z, Z, вниз — и я пробил рифмовкой комбо

Новый Vagabund — «Что они дуют?» Ты ловишь бэд-трип
Твоя мама стонет на хуях — выйдет клёвый эдлиб
Иду по пищевой цепи, пожирая шакалов
У твоей мамаши ВИЧ и СПИД — пожилая шалава
Я ебу ваш смысл, чтоб подкинуть свинью Моисею
Дай повыебонить на бите или петлю на шею

Я не знаю, на хуй мне ваш хайп, если жизнь одна?
Я мечтаю, чтоб подо мной, как шконка, тряслась рэп-игра

Стал еблоторговцем, как они, только не подал виду
Даже если на мне кипа — пидор, я кидаю зигу
Сжечь эту культуру изнутри и перебить их гуру
Чтобы кончить, мне нужны японки, тентакли и гуро
Горжусь их хейтом, этим отторжением среды
Ведь как электро — я питаюсь напряжением сети
Ты идола, мудак, не тронь, хоть он носатый, как тукан
Я всегда могу добыть огонь, подорвав пукан твой
Нет хитов форматных, создал стиль свой, сидя дома
Мазафакер — трахнул мазу стать вторым Оксимироном
Третьим Бабангидой, пятым Гуфом, пятнадцатым Стимом
КПСС — я буду первым, кто ебал вас в гриву
Андер или попс? Попробуй, втисни в категорию
На завтра феатуринг с Сашей Скулом и Ларисой Долиной
Мне это похуй всё, я запишу с десяток демок
Где ебу твоих блядей, но нынче только русских девок

Я не знаю, на хуй мне ваш хайп, если жизнь одна?

Spür wie dein Herz grad' einen Schlag überspringt!
Und wenn es kick kickt, alle Wände beben dann
Glaub' ich fest, dass ein Text noch immer Leben retten kann
Dass den Liedern, die man liebt
Immer Frieden inne liegt
Noten ewig leben
Kein Grab zu tief für die Musik
Wenn, wie bei mir, deine größte Sorge Mittelmaß ist
Und ich geh', bitte vergiss mich dann nicht (bitte vergiss mich nicht)
Sprüh's an die Wände
Sag' ""Wir waren hier!""
Anti alles für immer, dank dir!

[Part II]
Und sag mir, wie das war, wo du gingst
Ist es wahr mit den Farben, alles warm und gedimmt?
Als ich den Anruf bekam, die Sprache verging
Alle warten, dass ich was sag'
War nie stark in so Dingen...
Aber sag, wie war's?
Gab's wo du kamst den immerwährenden Chor?
Die Parade, so wie man sagt?
Ein überwältigendes Nichts hinter blendend grellem Licht
Die größte Party von allen!
Hoff' es hält, was es verspricht
Wette, du bist noch in der Bourbon Street und lachst über Touristen jede Nacht
In den Bars, die du sonst hasst
...und wird es dunkel in der Stadt voller Sünder: ""Champagne Supernova"" für immer (immer, immer)

229,Ma Baker,"[Intro (spoken)]
Freeze! I'm Ma Baker
Put your hands in the air
Give me all your money

This is the story of Ma Baker
The meanest cat from old Chicago town

[Verse 1]
She was the meanest cat
In old Chicago town
She was the meanest cat
She really mowed them down
She had no heart at all
No, no, no heart at all

She was the meanest cat
Oh, she was really tough
She left her husband flat
He wasn't tough enough
She took her boys along
'Cause they were mean and strong

[Chorus]
(Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma)
Ma Baker
She taught her four sons
(Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma)

To handle their guns
(Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma)

She never could cry
(Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma)
Ma Baker
But she knew how to die

[Verse 3]
They left a trail of crime
Across the U.S.A
And when one boy was killed
She really made them pay
She had no heart at all
No, no, no heart at all

To handle their guns

Then came a man she liked
She thought she'd stay with him
When he informed on them
They did away with him
She didn't care at all
Just didn't care at all

[Bridge (spoken)]
Here is a special bulletin
Ma Baker is the FBI's most wanted woman
Her photo is hanging on every post office wall
If you have any information about this woman
Please contact the nearest police station

Don't anybody move!
The money or your lives!

[Verse 5]
One day they robbed a bank
It was their last foray
The cops appeared too soon
They couldn't get away

And all the loot they had
It made them mighty mad
And so they shot it out
Ma Baker and her sons

They didn't want to hang
They died with blazing guns
And so the story ends
Of one who left no friends

232,Let's Clean Up The Ghetto,"[Intro: Lou Rawls]
You know
I was in New York City a few months ago
And the garbage and the trashmen were on strike
I'm tellin', the maintenance people of the city
What they were tryin' to do
They were tryin' to get a little more money
You know, get a little raise in pay
But at that particular time the city was broke
They were about to declare default
I tell you, the garbage in some places
Were stacked up two, three stories high
At night, haha
Boy, at night it weren't even safe to walk the street
'Cause there come the rats
The roaches and the waterbugs
And the neighborhood hustlin', baby
Tryin' to get somethin' to eat, see?
And let met tell you somethin'
It was stinkin'
And it was all kind of diseases in there, you know?
But it only brought to mind the fact that
You can no longer depend on the man downtown
To take care of business like he's supposed to
When he's supposed to
If all of us would get it like it's supposed to be
As far as cleaniness, you know, and safety
We gotta get together and do it for ourselves
That's the only way it's gonna be done
And you know what I'm talkin' about?
Let me tell you what I mean

Clean it up, clean it up (Well, y'all)
Clean it up, clean it up (You gotta get it)
Clean it up, clean it up (Yes, gonna get it)

Let's get rid of all the foul talk
We gonna do it
In order for us to survive
I said we're gonna (Clean it up, clean it up) Do it

In a relationship; save it, bitch!
Babysit? You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl, you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I tell a motherfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips? Bitch, why ask?
Kiss my dick, get my cash?
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out, I'll put you out
Won't get out, I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice? Buy you ice?

What, you Mariah? Fly through twice

Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
It's no secret, everybody knows
Yeah, we fucked: bitch, so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends, I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kinda car I'll be in
We'll see how much you be'll partyin' then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?
I'd never love you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you

Love that tattoo, what's that say?

You want what you can't have
Ooh girl, that's too damn bad

And they cheer and have parades but when it's over
They don't claim to know the answers anymore

And if you can hear me singin' so do you
And I'm turnin' out my night light feelin' satisfied
That there's nothin' any one of us can do
No, there's nothin' anyone of us can do

Babies cry all day sometimes for nothin'
And I have cried all day for not much more
Well it ain't easy when you hate the things you're lovin'
And you wonder what or maybe who you're lovin' for
And girls seem to think that they're the chosen ones
And women choose to let well enough alone
And it's their business til you stick your nose in ones

And my head in the cool blue north

I know the woman wishes we would move some place
Where the houses aren't all the same

Jesse, I wish you would take me where the grass is greener
I couldn't really say where it may be
Oh, some place high on a mountain top
Or down by the deep blue sea

And there we'll do just as we please
It ain't nothing but a breeze

All the pretty girls will call me ""Sir""
Now where they're asking me how things are
Soon they'll ask me how things are

Well, I don't mind being an old gray Grandpa
As long as you'll be my gray Grandma
But I wish we would move with our tea and cookies
To the shade of the old pawpaw

There we'll do just as we please

For other folks it just drags on

Check the local newspapers

The crowd will be swaying and singing along
And all you got to do is get in into the mix
If you need a fix
Come back baby
Rock and roll never forgets
Oh the bands still playing it loud and lean
Listen to the guitar player making it scream
All you got to do is just make that scene tonight
Heh tonight

Well now sweet sixteens turned thirty-one
Feel a little tired feeling under the gun

It ain't never too late to learn about love
Learn about love

Remember the days of the old schoolyard
We used to laugh a lot, oh don't you?
Remember the days of the old schoolyard
When we had imaginings and we had
All kinds of things and we laughed
And needed love, yes, I do
Oh and I remember you

Remember the days of the old schoolyard
We used to cry a lot, oh don't you?
Remember the days of the old schoolyard
When we had simplicity and we had
Warm toast for tea and we laughed
And needed love, yes, I do
Oh and I remember you

You were my sweet love, my first sweet love
My lovey dove my love, lovey dove
No matter what place, whichever the place
I still see your face, your smiling face

In childish dreams, inside my dreams
Like King and Queen, God save our dreams
N'though time may face, though time may fade
It ain't never too late to learn about love
Learn about love

Remember the days of the old schoolyard
We used to laugh a lot, oh don't you?
Remember the days of the old schoolyard
When we had imaginings and we had
All kinds of things and we laughed
And needed love, yes, I do
Oh and I remember you",Cat Stevens,1977,"[65, 65, 57, 33, 34, 40, 45, 56, 66, 82]",10
242,For A While,"[Intro: Nipsey Hussle]
That's right...
Yeah, look

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Blue cup, black gun
Paid dues, that's done
Favors from me, can't ask none
Black eyed the game and got passed on
Me, I kept this shit super solid
Came up, and nigga you acknowledge
See me in my coupe, I got stupid dollars
I'm a dropout but now I speak at colleges
Ironic, I'm honest
I get paid to speak my mind, and it's crazy to me
Just pay me, fooly; if I wrote a script, it'd be a crazy movie
About my life, about rolling dice
About taking risks, you gotta know the price
Gotta know yourself, on the coldest nights
Can't turn it down, you gotta own the fight
Win, lose, or draw, you could ball
You could've kept it real, but nigga, you's a fraud
Before you get the shit, you gotta lose it all
And then you find yourself and see that you's a God
And that's real shit, thousand hundred dollar bill shit
From hood to the hills shit, like, ""How the fuck did we build this?""
Real shit, look
Blue cup, black gun
Paid dues, that's done
Favors from me, can't ask none
Came in the game then I passed up
And I can't stop, won't stop
I'm the type to get more guap
You the type to fa sho flop
I'm from Brynhurst and them dope spots
Now look

[Chorus: Vernardo]
It's hard but it's fast, see, these haters don't care
When they see you, they stop and stare
(See you, they stop and stare)
Rollin' on them thangs with them gold out rings
Smokin' kush and switchin' lanes (Switchin' lanes)
See, the only thing I think about is when the star might fall
See, we won't stop until we reach the top
And we gon' be there for a while

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
Aye, check it out, look
I'm still runnin' laps, takin' fades, I still run it back
Talkin' guns, I got a hundred straps
And I be in your bush if you fuck wit' Fats, that's a fact
I don't fuck wit' rats
This boss life, I got a lust for that
Pullin' up at Sak's, blow a hundred sacks in my V12
I don't fuckin' slack, not at all
I gotta ball, they shot my dog
Rest in peace, my nigga, Frog
Life is short, nigga, then it's gone
But in the meantime we tryna get it all
You should get involved, I'm really raw
Before this rap shit, I really balled
Alpina's, nigga, on white Lincoln's, nigga
Black Beamers, nigga, they can't see us, nigga, naw
Sometimes I get so offended by it
Don't compare me to none of these fuckin' liars
I'm fuckin' flyer, I'm fuckin' realer
Play wit' me, I'll be a fuckin' killer
Dropped seven tapes wit' no fuckin' filler
Now Victory Lap's my fuckin' Thriller, uh
If you broke, I ain't fuckin' wit' you
Unless you went broke while you was fuckin' wit' me
Then we bounce back 'cause it's nothing really
Gon' do it big 'til they fuckin' kill me

[Chorus: Vernardo]
It's hard but it's fast, see, these haters don't care
When they see you, they stop and stare
(See you, they stop and stare)
Rollin' on them thangs with them gold out rings
Smokin' kush and switchin' lanes (Switchin' lanes)
See, the only thing I think about is when the star might fall
See, we won't stop until we reach the top
And we gon' be there for a while

[Interlude: Nipsey Hussle]
Yeah
I could remember, like, bangin' on the MPC late night
Gettin' kicked outta the house because of that shit
Catchin' the 108 to the Blue Line
Niggas sittin' on the bridge, loadin' up they burners, sweatin'
We were just kids tryna get to it
Takin' losses, stayin' down
Frustration
Go looking back at the shit right now, it's like, it's nothin'
It's gon' feel like that for you, too
Hustlers

[Chorus: Vernardo]
It's hard but it's fast, see, these haters don't care

My cherie amour, lovely as a summer day
My cherie amour, distant as the milky way
My cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine

That behind that little smile I wore
How I wish that you were mine

That just goes to show
That you really don't know

While you're out paintin' the town
Do you think I'm home just sittin' around waitin' on you
Now who's really the fool

I felt so left out 'til I got to know her
So I tried the way that she got over

Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight
Yes, The angel in your arms this morning
Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight

Why'd you slip around secretly
If you were tired of loving me
Why'd you keep holdin' on when love was already gone

The times you said you weren't feelin' well
Did you think I couldn't tell you'd been with someone else
You were only kiddin' yourself

When I first found out I hurt all over
I felt so left out 'til I got to know her
So I tried the way that she got over
And I became just like her

You were minding your life

Lady, when you looked my way
I had a strange sensation
And, darling, that's when I knew

That it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along
Yes, it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along

Oh, I wake up in the night
And I reached beside me
Hoping you will be there

But instead I find someone
Who believed in me when I said
I'd always care

Oh, it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along
Yes, it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along

So I lived my life in a dream world
For the rest of my days
Just you and me walking hand in hand
In a wishful memory

Oh, I guess that's all
That it would ever be

Wish I had a time machine
I could make myself go back
Until the day I was born

And I would live my life again
And rearrange it so that
I'd be yours from now on

Oh, it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along
Yes, it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along

Oh, it's sad to belong to someone else
When the right one comes along
Yes, it's sad to belong to someone else

That I've been down the hall

Down the hall, sweet Joanna

People have gazed and wandered upon the great China wall

I'd willingly surrender all my arms
If you decided you won't be long
I'd wait here patient for you
Look for you every morning

Had this love, these were sparks, we tried to push it on

Maybe it's time we got back to the basics of love

With Waylon and Willie and the boys
This successful life we're livin'
Got us feuding like the Hatfields and McCoys
Between Hank Williams' pain songs and
Newbury's train songs and Blue Eyes Cryin' in the Rain
Out in Luckenbach, Texas ain't nobody feelin' no pain

So baby, let's sell your diamond ring
Buy some boots and faded jeans and go away
This coat and tie is choking me
In your high society you cry all day
We've been so busy keepin' up with the Jones
Four car garage and we're still building on
Maybe it's time we got back to the basics of love

Like a shadow in the night
And it hangs like a curtain
Till morning brings light

I've been hurting so long
I'm starting to wonder
If I'll ever leave you behind
I know I'll forget you
It's a matter of time

If it's the last thing I do
I'll sleep without dreaming
Your memory won't wake me
To cry in the dark
When my heart isn't beating
It might finally quit aching
I'll get over you
If it's the last thing I do

You're my love of a lifetime
The one I knew would last
And I know I'll spend my future
Living in my past

But there will come a time
When my tears have all fallen
And I can keep living for the day
When this heartache will release me
And I can fly away

If it's the last thing I do
I'll sleep without dreaming
Your memory won't wake me

What's real

The worries disappear

You asked me once you asked me twice
But still I will say no
Stop - I gotta getaway

They drove me once insane

Holla back ... hey Terry you gon' be big boy
Y'knahmsayin? ... aiyyo, aiyyo Jody
Hey you can tell somebody to go downstairs to the car and shit, get that bottle of Voo
Out the back of the back for me baby
I need to get right before I do this here

It's enough to get any man caught up
(I'm feeling you)
And I'm feeling we should both be free
(If we were through)
Just imagine what life be without me

[Verse 1 - Ja Rule]
Mami I put my best foot forward, though it's kinda awkward
Cause I'm pigeon-toed and bow-legged, but you ain't too proud to beg
First time we got alone, you gave me some head
And been calling me ever since, to do it again
When we met you was a seven, just creeping to ten
And now your my lucky quarter, the days get shorter, lights get longer
You know when the weather is cold, feelings grow stronger
Wanna perform her, your pussy feel like walking pneumonia
Got me sniffling, sneezing, coughing, and aching and shit
And I'm starting to think I'm falling in love with this bitch
I'm having dreams about her jeans and how they fit
In that Urban Jeffrey baby tee
She's wearing my name already, so you know she's fucking me
I'm a G like that, but for you I fell backwards
The only question I ask myself is ... shit

Why me? Better yet why you and I?
Why I always pick the ones not in they right mind and crazy?
Singing ""Dangerously In Love"" ... this a dangerous broad I'm fuckin
Like Al it's the ""Scent of a Woman""
That got me playing hardball like Doc Gooden
Excuse my intruding, I don't mean to be rude, but our situation is kinda amusin'
Cause we both like each other, but scared of each other
It's like we more than friends, but less than lovers
And my niggas can't tell us, what we been doing is wrong
And your girl's getting jealous, cause we been getting along
Hold on, this is how it all begins
You call your friends, I'll call my friends, we'll all be friends
And hang out at the mansion, in the Hamptons on weekends
Then it all ends, and the question is ..

I see the sunrise, and wish that it could hit ya face

He was brutally handsome, and she was terminally pretty
She held him up, and he held her for ransom in the heart
Of the cold, cold city
He had a nasty reputation as a cruel dude
They said he was ruthless, they said he was crude
They had one thing in common, they were good in bed
She'd say, ""Faster, faster. The lights are turnin' red.""

[Chorus 1]
Life in the fast lane, Surely makes you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane, Huh
Are you with me so far?

[Verse 2]
Eager for action and hot for the game
The coming attraction, the drop of a name
They knew all the right people, they took all the right pills
They threw outrageous parties, they paid heavenly bills
There were lines on the mirror, lines on her face
She pretended not to notice, she was caught up in the race
Out every evening, until it was light
He was too tired to make it, she was too tired to fight about it

Life in the fast lane, Surely makes you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane, Huh
Life in the fast lane, Everything all the time
Life in the fast lane, Huh

Blowin' and burnin', blinded by thirst
They didn't see the stop sign, took a turn for the worst

267,The Killing Of Georgie (Part I And II),"In these days of changing ways
So called liberated days
A story comes to mind of a friend of mine

Georgie boy was gay I guess
Nothing more or nothing less
The kindest guy I ever knew

His mother's tears fell in vain
The afternoon George tried to explain
That he needed love like all the rest

Pa said there must be a mistake
How can my son not be straight
After all I've said and done for him

Leaving home on a Greyhound bus
Cast out by the ones he loves
A victim of these gay days it seems

Georgie went to New York town
Where he quickly settled down
And soon became the toast of the great white way

Accepted by Manhattan's elite
In all the places that were chic
No party was complete without George

Along the boulevards he'd cruise
And all the old queens blew a fuse
Everybody loved Georgie boy

The last time I saw George alive
Was in the summer of seventy-five
He said he was in love I said I was pleased

George attended the opening night
Of another Broadway hype
But split before the final curtain fell

Deciding to take a short cut home
Arm in arm they meant no wrong
A gentle breeze blew down fifth avenue

Out of a darkened side street came
A New Jersey gang with just one aim
To roll some innocent passer-by

There ensued a fearful fight
Screams rang out in the night
Georgie's head hit a sidewalk cornerstone

A leather kid, a switchblade knife
He didn't intend to take his life
He just pushed his luck a little too far that night

The sight of blood dispersed the gang
And a crowd gathered, the police came
An ambulance screamed to a halt on fifty-third and third

Georgie's life ended there
But I ask who really cares
George once said to me and I quote

He said ""never wait or hesitate
Get in kid, before it's too late
You may never ever get another chance
'Cause youth a mask but it don't last
Live it long and live it fast""
Georgie was a friend of mine

Oh Georgie stay
Don't go away
Georgie please stay
You take our breath away
Oh Georgie please stay
You take our breath away",Tutu Puoane,1977,"[64, 42, 30, 32, 36, 40, 46, 59, 71, 84]",10

Then everyone would feel the way I do

A bed for one can just be so cold

Someone there to have and hold

You became a friend of mine

You're my spirit to be strong
A friend when things go wrong

Loves grown deep, deep into the heart of me
You've become a part of me
Let us plant the seed and watch it grow
Loves grown deep, deep into the heart of me
You've become a part of me

As we travel down the road
Side-by-side we'll share the load
Hand-in-hand we'll see each other through
Though we've only just begun
Let's count our blessings one-by-one
I thank God for life, I thank God for you

Loves grown deep, deep into the heart of me
You've become a part of me
Let us plant the seed and watch it grow
Loves grown deep, deep into the heart of me
You've become a part of me

And as the seasons slip away
Forever lovers we will stay

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
I was riding ’round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
Had to pray to almighty God they let my dog out the kennel
When you get it straight up out the mud, you can't imagine this shit
I been pullin' up in the drop tops with the baddest bitches
Young nigga been focused on my check (Mhmmhm)
Got a new coupe wrapped around my neck (Mhmmhm)
Tryna put the water on my Patek (Mhmmhm)
I got killers to the left of me (Mhmmhm)

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
We was lurking on 'em, ain't show no mercy on 'em
We was goin' back to back, we put a curfew on 'em
It was dark clouds on us, but that was perfect for us
We know you always crash and burn, but it was working for us
Limo tint the V-12, double check the details
Gotta cross my T’s and dot my I’s or I can't sleep well
Millions off of retail
Once again, I prevail
Knew that shit was over from the day I dropped my presale
Hold up, let the beat build
See me in the streets still
I been fightin’ battles up a steep hill
They gave my road dog twelve, it was a sweet deal
And I been ridin' solo tryna rebuild
Look

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
Look, under no condition would you ever catch me slippin'
Motorcaded shooters plus the Maybach chauffeur driven
If they catch me wit' it, gon' send me off to prison
Judge ain't sympathizin', court don't show forgiveness
Engine in the Lambo drownin' out the music
Silk Dior with the flowers, five gold Cubans
Champagne while I shop, hope I splurge foolish
Closin' Escrow twice this month, both commercial units
Damn, I wish my nigga Fatts was here
How you die thirty somethin' after banging all them years?
Grammy-nominated, in the sauna sheddin' tears
All this money, power, fame and I can't make you reappear
But I don't wipe 'em though
We just embrace the only life we know
If it was me, I would tell you, ""Nigga, live your life and grow""
I'd tell you, ""Finish what we started, reach them heights, you know?
And gas the V-12 'til the pipe in smoke""

[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle]
Another million dollar bail, that's just some regular shit
See my granny on a jet, some shit I'll never forget
Next day we flew to Vegas, with my Puma connects
We break bread, we ain't new to success
Bleed music, invest, enterprise, take lucrative steps
Cold game, but I knew it was Chess
As a youth in the set
Learn the game, you a student at best
But it's a couple things you can expect
Look, just like money know money, nigga, shooters respect
Other shooters we was both, don't want my crew on your neck
I'm on the freeway in a drop, it got me losing my breath
I do the dash with the blues on the deck

When all you get from love is a love song
It's got you laying up nights
Waiting for the music to start

Are written with a broken heart

Now the tears in my eyes are ever blinding
The future that lies before me I cannot see
Although tomorrow I know the sun is rising
Lighting up the world for everyone but not for me

Goodbye, my friend
Been thinking all day about our conversation
We've reached the end
Been sitting here doing a lot of contemplatin'
Had me there waiting making me impatient
Losing my mind, it gets me so frustrated
Lately I'm questioning your dedication
Thinking all day about our conversation

Goodbye, my lover
I'm wondering how I'm gonna break it to you
Go find another
I won't be the one who's gonna wait here for you

Just empty words that watch me walking from you
You think our story needs to be continued
This is the end, you don't believe me, do you?

Good old friend of mine
You've been reaching for yourself for such a long time
There's so much to say
No need to explain
Just an open door for you to come in from the rain

It's a long road
When you're on your own
And someone like you
Will always choose the long way home
There's no right or wrong
I'm not here to blame
I just won't to be the one
Who keeps you from the rain )
From the rain

And it looks like sunny skies
Now that I know you're all right
Time has left us older and wiser
I know I am
And it's good to know
My best friend has come home again
'Cause I think of us
Like on old cliché
But it doesn't matter
'Cause I love you any way
Come in from the rain
Come in from the rain

UNTIL THE NEXT TIME
(Carole Bayer Sager' Johnny Vastano)
I'm not supposed to feel this way
You'd think I'd know a whole lot better
But it sure feels good lyin' here next to you, babe
You make me do all the things I've wanted me to

And I'm not supposed to call your name
You'd think by now I'd realize it
But I can't hold back on these feelings inside
And sometimes I want to shout 'em up to the sky
You're not supposed to be the one that I'm needing
But I'm not strong enough to do what I should do
So I'll lust close my eyes and hold to the feeling
Until the next time-until the next time

And I never knew I'd feel like this
Stealin' hours in the night
But just like a child who found some candy in the store
I tasted your love and now I keep wantin' more
I'm not supposed to be the one you're dreamin'
But I'm not sure dreams don't keep me alive
So I'll lust close my eyes and hold to the feeling
And I won't let it go
Until the next time

You're not supposed to be the one I'm needin'
But I'm not strong enough to do what I should do
So I'll just close my eyes and hold to the feeling
And I won't let it go
Until the next time",Carole Bayer Sager,1977,"[99, 99, 61, 61, 64, 69, 80]",7

Where the waters flow where the rivers run
Every new road that I walk along
I can see your face and tries it really strong

But all I do know is I love you
And I want you to be happy

Keeps reminding me of a new-born child
And every new room that I come into
I can see your face, baby no mistake

But all I do know is I love you
And I want you to be happy
All I know is I love you true
And I want you to be happy

I remember those
Neon nites with you

Give me some high trotting
Sure got it on
Those oogie boogie
Honky tonky songs

You wore your silver stockings
We danced 'til dawn
Hootchie cootchie

Hard rocking all night long

Now the dance of bright lights
Make me blue
I miss those neon nites

To play a disco song so the ladies will dance

Cause when yuou dance slow there's nothin to say
And if he comes on strong she can't get away

I'm lady lookin but I can't get cooking

Slow dancin, it don't turn me on

293,Couldn't Get It Right,"[Intro]

Time was drifting
This rocker got to roll
So I hit the road and made my getaway
Restless feeling, really got a hold
I started searching for a better way

But I kept on looking for a sign
In the middle of the night
But I couldn't see the light
No, I couldn't see the light
I kept on looking for a way
To take me through the night
I couldn't get it right
I couldn't get it right

LA fever made me feel alright
But I must admit it got the best of me
Getting down, so deep I could have drowned
Now, I can't get back the way I used to be

But I kept on looking for a sign
In the middle of the night
But I couldn't see the light
No, I couldn't see the light
I kept on looking for a way
To take me through the night
I couldn't get it right
I couldn't get it right

And I nearly died from hospitality
Left me stranded, took away my pride

I'm going down, down, down, down

We get dressed up and we go
Out, baby, for the night
We come home early burning
Burning in some fire fight
I'm sick and tired of you setting me up, girl
Setting me up just to knock, knock, knock me
Down, down down
Going down, down, down, down

[Verse 3]
Pull you close but when we kiss
When we kiss I can feel the doubt
I remember back when we started
My kisses used to turn you inside out
I used to drive you to work in the mornings
Friday night I'd drive you all around
You used to love to drive me wild, but

You're looney friend just made a pass at me (slap him in the face)

Why don't you take up with the baker's wife instead of me, fool!

Pack up your rubber duck
I'd like to wish you luck
Your funny cigarettes
Your sixty-one cassettes
Pack all your clothes away
Your rubber hose away
Your old-day-glos away

308,Uptown Festival (Part 1),"The Velvet Underground & Nico album came out in 1967 amid the hippie revolution in the summer of love. The Velvet’s were disillusioned with these ideas and presented a darker side of things, one that was diametrically opposed to the popular counterculture movement of the time. They laid the foundation for punk and glam rock, and even influenced electronic music movements. The Velvet Underground were able to demystify the sexual freedom and the drug culture of the 1960’s through matter of fact observations of New York street life that served as the antithesis to the West Coast feel good vibe and in doing so, created one of the most influential, prophetic albums of all time that expressed an alienation not being represented in popular culture before them

The Velvet Underground were a quintessentially New York band. They embodied the streets they knew in every way. They wrote songs about real things that they saw, and they certainly saw some interesting things during their time with Andy Warhol’s eclectic gang of outcasts. Their peers consisted of artists, junkies, homosexuals, and transvestites. Like Andy Warhol’s pop art, their music was “anti-art made by anti-art elitists” (Heylin XI). They were one of the first rock and roll bands who had no chance of reaching a mass audience because they clashed so deeply with much of society’s foundations. Their music was intellectual but they weren’t intellectual 'elitists' in the traditional sense of the word. They took inspiration from trashy paperback novels rather than the widely regarded literary classics

The first track, Sunday Morning, is the most delicate on the album and the last to be recorded. It’s really the only track that aims to be beautiful, and is. It’s a sort of precursory reminder to the audience that the cacophony and noise about to come is intentional; it isn't stemming from a lack of musical skill or knowledge. This sort of attitude is what the whole punk movement was based upon, but the punks adapted an attitude that preexisting musical knowledge wasn’t necessary. The attitude and the ideas behind the song are what really matters, and this is what the Velvet Underground served on their debut album. With the opening number, their softest track, they prove that they weren’t relying solely on shock appeal and a confrontational attitude. ‘Sunday Morning’ represents the calm before the storm and it is unclear whether the song is first or last in chronological order of the album. The song contains the most commercial sound on the album but also somber lyrics. It reads like a peaceful Sunday morning after a long, hard week in New York City. Though not overt or as confrontational as the rest of the songs, it shows their multiple personalities. One when they are relatively sober, albeit coming down as he sings “Sunday morning and I’m falling down.” The album takes no moral stance on all of the crazy things they’ve seen in the streets and been a part of; but they represent real things going on and not a dream world where everything is always fine. Some of these things are hard to confront as Reed sings “I’ve got a feeling I don’t want to know.” This could be about what happened or what’s about to happen throughout the album. It recognizes that, although the album consists of a series of vignettes representative of NY street culture, all of the stories aren’t completely contained within the album. It doesn’t manage to tie everything up in a neat way. There are stories from before the album and after that are parts of the same narrative but the audience won't be let in on them

The Velvet Underground were used to deep alienation beyond the normal level. Even within the biggest counter-cultural movement in American history going on, they couldn’t (or didn’t want to) find a place within a larger cross-section of American culture. The only place they seemed to fit in was with Andy Warhol’s factory crowd, a self-described group of misfits. Instead of going on along with the hippies rebelling against post-war conformity and conservatism in the 1950’s, they pushed the boundaries even further than the hippies out west and intentionally made people feel uncomfortable. Hippie music became popular and eventually co-opted by the mainstream like every other large cultural movement before and after (Jazz, Blues, Punk, Hip-Hop etc.). The Velvet’s pushed the boundaries about as far as they could be pushed, nothing was off limits. Subject matter was real and dark, portraying the seedier side of New York and America as a whole. Instead of singing specifically about equality in race relations, racial issues are subtly brought up within the narrative of the songs that feel deeply rooted in the New York that Reed was living in. In ‘I’m Waiting For The Man’ he sings “hey white boy, what you doing up town?” The rest of the lines around it are unclear what the narrator of the song actually is doing uptown sparking much debate as to if it’s as straight forward as it first appears, that the narrator is looking to buy ‘smack.’ Another popular interpretation is that ‘the man’ of the song was actually a homosexual lover of the narrator. This theory comes from the lines where the narrator is asked “hey white boy, you chasin’ our women around?” and he responds “oh pardon me sir, it’s the furthest thing from my mind, I’m just looking for a dear, dear friend of mine.” This dear friend of his may have been more than someone that just sold him narcotics. Reed wasn’t writing these songs as a peace activist or even outwardly promoting equality like the West Coast was fond of. He provides a succinct, but ultimately telling story of race relations in New York City in a nonchalant, conversational tone. The song is set in Harlem, a predominately African-American community, and the tone in which the narrator is addressed suggests that he, a white man, has no business being there, thus is up to no good. He’s looking for something that needs to be hidden from mainstream white society, whether it be drugs or unconventional sexuality. Here, he takes no explicit position, like in ‘Heroin,’ but establishes the setting with a gritty realism and doesn’t try to hide what’s really going on in the neighborhoods of America. He’s not trying to sell anything, but he does tell the story of an underrepresented class of people in America whose issues had been largely ignored. Reed has no qualms about calling it like it is

This deep cultural alienation can inevitably lead to drug use, and sometimes abuse, when a certain sect of society is ignored or marginalized. The Velvet Underground understood this and with Reed’s lyrics and the backing instrumentation, these groups of alienated people are addressed. While the west coast largely advocated drug use, especially LSD by groups such as Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead, The Velvet Underground made music about drugs, and inspired by drugs but didn’t ostensibly advocate their use.  This is a key difference between the two coasts; the Velvets understood that drugs were an escape, one which some people found necessary to modern life. Not everyone took them to party or have a good time. Hardcore drug users need the drugs because the life they perceive is so bad that something drastic is needed to violently shake them from that world. Reed addresses the issues that lead to drug abuse within ‘Heroin’ and also cedes that “when the smack begins to flow,” he “just doesn’t care anymore” and it makes him “feel like a man.” The whole song is a musical representation of what shooting heroin feels like to the user. While there is no endorsement or denouncement, the first verse is certainly the most joyful section of the song. It opens with a singular guitar, with a very calm riff hat slowly builds with added instrumentation layered on top of each other. The drums follow the heartbeat of the user, starting off steady and once the heroin is injected, it becomes much more frantic and erratic. Around the five minute mark, the screeching viola reaches a pinnacle with the heartbeat drums driving forward faster and faster almost drowning out Reed’s vocals, perhaps signifying that the drug doesn’t allow the mind’s thoughts to fully come through and they are distorted through the lens of the drug

The Velvet Underground and the hippies both used and sang about drugs, but their approaches were completely different. Lou Reed sings in ‘Heroin’ that it makes him feel like “Jesus’ son.” He acknowledges that the drug obviously makes the user feel powerful while also making a slight jab at Christianity and the idea that Jesus was actually married to Mary Magdalene and fathered children with her. Heroin is an escape for the user and the lyrics acknowledge this when they say “when the heroin is in my blood, and that blood is in my head, thank God I’m as good as dead, and thank your God that I’m not aware, and thank God that I just don’t care.” There is another shot at religion with “your God” and it reveals the desperation that heroin users face, and the mindset that leads to drug addiction, to get away from the world that we live in and temporarily escape to a place where there are no “jim jims” or “politicians making crazy sounds.” The ephemeral joys that the drug provides are just that, there is no end in sight. Lou Reed once said, “I take drugs just because, in the 20th century, in a technological age living in the city, there are certain drugs you have to take just to keep yourself normal like a caveman, just to bring yourself up or down.” He didn’t advocate using drugs or not, he is matter of fact about the way they feel and what causes him. It is just something you do to feel “normal” in his eyes. The music emulates the feelings of a drug user and goes up and down with the highs and lows. John Cale stated that the long vamps on two chords that droned on was “an attempt to control the unconscious with the hypnotic.”

Lou Reed, the main songwriter who shared vocal duties on the album with Nico, was not afraid of adverse reactions to his lyrics. He actually welcomed them and the inside sleeves of the album displayed some of the negative reviews the press had written about the shows, displaying that the band were “perversely proud of them” (Hogan 39). One of the major themes in Lou’s songwriting was sexuality, more specifically non-traditional sexual practices. The name for the band was drawn from a book published in 1963 by Michael Leigh called The Velvet Underground about paraphilia (intense sexual arousal to atypical objects, situations, or individuals) in the United States. They found the name “evocative of underground cinema” (Phoenix 1). The title seemed fit for the name of the band as they had already written the song ‘Venus in Furs’ based off the book by the same title. The word Sado-Masochism is derived from Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, the author of said book. The cover of The Velvet Underground book says “Here is an incredible book. It will shock and amaze you. But as a documentary on the sexual corruption of our age, it is a must for every thinking adult.” The band seemed to take this philosophy wholeheartedly into every facet of their music and their live shows

The fourth track of the album, ‘Venus in Furs’, is an adaptation of   Sacher-Masoch's 1870 novel into song form. Severin, the protagonist of the book is madly in love with Wanda von Dunajew, the novel’s central female character. He is so infatuated with her that he literally asks to be her slave and asks her to treat him as such, in increasingly degrading ways. The fourth line in the song, “strike dear mistress, and cure his heart” is seemingly directly from the novel. In the novel, Severin asks to be whipped hard by Wanda so he can be ‘cured’ of his severe infatuation to her but the abuse he receives only deepens his love and intensifies his extreme feelings and devotion. Sach-Masoch refers to this as “suprasensuality.” The more frequent and violently abused, the more devoted he became to his “mistress,” as she makes him refer to her as. The parallels between the novel and Reed’s own life are hard to ignore. Both the novel, and Lou’s childhood used extreme measures to ‘cure’ a perceived problem through harsh techniques. Lou’s deviant behavior, described as “homosexual tendencies,” was regarded as a mental illness in the 1960’s and he was ‘treated’ with electro-shock therapy which he later wrote about in ‘Kill Your Sons’ during his solo career (Hogan 6). In both cases, these techniques only brought about more suffering. Reed’s deviance wasn’t accepted by society or more importantly, by his family and this led to intense alienation which would later drive his work. The hippie mindset of peace and love wasn’t the reality Reed faced in the New York streets. There were real consequences for being different and doing something that most people didn’t approve of. Later in the song, Reed sings of “ermine furs” which “adorn the imperious.” While displaying his vast vocabulary and familiarity with obscure literature, he is able to vividly describe the imagery of the novel and stay true to the main components of the story, essentially poetically summarizing the novel. The use of “imperious” reinforces the dominatrix relationship while “ermine furs” strengthen the imagery of the scene that is being described while the musical ensemble is a “whips ‘n’ chains atmosphere called up by John Cale’s viola drones cut by slashes and Maureen Tucker’s slave master time keeping on kettle drum and tambourine” (Zak 57). The instrumentation allows the Velvets to explore areas that a novel can’t and portray the sinister and desperate situations described through the imagery of their ensemble

The main root of their drug use (and abuse) and sexual deviance was an intense sense of alienation.  They were in the fast paced east coast world that didn’t care about your feelings; it was about getting things done. Getting together and feeling alright was not on the agenda. This alienation led them down a path that no one in popular music had been down before. One of their main goals was to antagonize the audience, whether it was the audience at home listening to the record or the audience at the show. At their live shows, Andy Warhol movies would be playing in the background while the band wailed away on the guitars with feedback which “sounded like 12 million guitars going at one time with the amplified, intensified screeches that really hurt the eardrums” (Heylin 43). The goal was to create an atmosphere that was uncharted territory and pushed the audience passed their limits. Warhol said about the pictures that played behind them, “if the audience can take it for ten minutes, I show it for fifteen minutes” (Heylin 49). The effect was to disorient the audience and leave them “too stunned to think or say anything or give any kind of opinion” (Heylin 45). They struck chords deep within people that made them think about what it truly means to be alive. These songs weren’t mindless pop tunes to wash over the listener and make them feel safe or momentarily give them pleasure, but they brought out the raw emotions that lay deep within and forced the listener to at least consider an alternative, at times being so radical that they wouldn’t even know how to react. This approach was obviously not popular with the masses and at their shows most of the audience would end up leaving early with about ninety percent of the remaining spectators were “hostile to the show” (Heylin 48)
Ralph J Gleason, a respected critic for the San Francisco Chronicle, described their performance nothing more than a bad condensation of all the bum trips of the Trips Festival. He reportedly pulled the plug when they left the stage with their guitars leaning on the amps to create a “squalor of electronic noise” (Schindler & Schwartz 315). They also did this to Bill Graham at another show in San Francisco and set about smashing Morrison’s drum kit after their set with the amps still blaring. He confronted them after the show and they brushed him off; they later said he was muttering something about “insurance reasons” as Reed was injured from a flying cymbal to his head and was bleeding profusely after the chaotic destruction. This is not to say that all of California was against them, but many prominent hippies were. They actually had a stronger following in California than any other state probably because they antagonized the hippies and anyone that felt alienated by the hippie movement could listen to the group that defined alienation. The Velvet's music and performances were dark and abrasive. The Grateful Dead and other San Francisco Sound bands focused on beautiful melodies where the Velvets focused on long droning noises composed of vamps on one or two chords. Maureen Tucker called the Dead the “most boring band” she’d ever heard while Lou Reed said their music was “tedious, a lie, and untalented” (Jovanic 85)

The Velvet Underground remained a shape shifting, and ultimately widely influential band that came from the bottoms of the society and completely represented that through their art. They made music about drugs, not-traditional sexual practices, and other issues of modern life that were rooted in a sense of alienation from the major countercultural narrative of the 1960’s. Even with the recent passing of primary songwriter Lou Reed, their direct influence lives on in popular bands such as The Strokes and Arctic Monkeys and with the advent of the internet, their legacy has a potential to continue to spread for the foreseeable future

309,Hotel California,"[Verse 1: Don Henley]
On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
""This could be Heaven or this could be Hell""
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

[Chorus: Don Henley]
""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here""

[Verse 2: Don Henley]
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes Benz
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
She calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain
""Please bring me my wine""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here since 1969""
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

[Chorus: Don Henley]
""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They living it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis""

[Verse 3: Don Henley]
Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said: ""We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device""
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
""Relax,"" said the night man
""We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave!""

Trying to make money so I can make honeys blow on my dick
I go on a quick mission to find some kil'
Ain't no big deal, just hop in tha Seville
Mah homey put me down quarter pound for a bill
Wake up in tha morning and I have weed still and I chill

Too old to be listenin' into what you say so ho get off me
You're born in this world by ya self and you die alone
So as long as ya grown, shit, ya might as well go on and just

[Verse 2]
Now everybody's got elders and you should respect em

Now close friends and relatives they should be constantly by ya side
And understand you gotta let ya conscience be your guide
There finally comes a time for ya self you must decide

[Verse 3]
And there's a couple of fucked up man-made rules that we should follow
But you gotta realize you just might not wake up tomorrow
And tha dollar you earn is tha dolla you spend
Go get sumthin for ya kids or buy a bottle of gin

We're X and O's in this game
Tryin to survive, tryin to get high, tryin to get by and stay alive
So do it til ya satisfied, not just a lil bit

312,Southern Nights,"[Verse 1]
Southern nights
Have you ever felt a Southern night?
Free as a breeze
Not to mention the trees
Whistlin' tunes that you know and love so

[Verse 2]
Southern nights
Just as good even when closed your eyes
I apologize
To anyone who can truly say
That he has found a better way

[Verse 3]
Southern skies
Have you ever noticed Southern skies? (In Southern sky)
Its precious beauty lies just beyond the eye
It goes runnin' through your soul
Like the stories told of old

[Verse 4]
Old man
He and his dog, they walk the old land
Every flower touched his cold hand
As he slowly walked by
Weepin' willows would cry for joy, joy

[Verse 5]
Feels so good
Feels so good, it's frightening
Wish I could
Stop this world from fighting
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da

[Verse 6]
Mystery
Like this and many others in the trees
Blow in the night
In the Southern skies

[Verse 7]
Southern nights
They feel so good, it's a frightening
Wish I could (Southern nights)
Stop this world from the fighting

314,Lido Shuffle,"{Intro}

Lido missed the boat that day he left the shack
But that was all he missed and he ain't comin' back
A tombstone bar in a jukejoint car, he made a stop
Just long enough to grab a handle off the top
Next stop Chi town, Lido put the money down and let it roll

He said one more job ought to get it
One last shot 'fore we quit it
One more for the road

Lido, whoa-oh-oh-oh
He's for the money, he's for the show
Lido's waitin' for the go
Lido, whoa-oh-oh-oh
He said one more job ought to get it
One last shot 'fore we quit it
One more for the road

Lido be runnin', havin' great big fun, until he got the note
Sayin' toe the line or blow, and that was all she wrote
He be makin' like a beeline, headin' for the borderline
Goin' for broke

Sayin' one more hit ought to do it
This joint ain't nothin to it
One more for the road

Lido, whoa-oh-oh-oh
He's for the money, he's for the show
Lido's waitin' for the go

Got to be free when you fall

Dyin' in our sleep, we're livin' out a dream
We only make it out alone

You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now

Yeah, Hollywood is bleeding, but we call it home

Outside, the winter sky turnin' grey
City up in smoke, it's only ash when it rains
Howl at the moon and go to sleep in the day
Love for everybody 'til the drugs fade away
In the mornin', blocking out the sun with the shades
She gotta check her pulse and tell herself that she okay
It seem like dying young is an honor
But who'd be at my funeral? I wonder
I go out, and all they eyes on me
I show out, do you like what you see?
And now they closin' in on me
Let 'em sharpen all they teeth
This is more than I can handle
Blood in my Lambo'
Wish I could go, oh, I'm losin' ho-ope
I light a candle, some Palo Santo
For all these demons, wish I could just go on

On a dolo mission, I got a date with the cake
Wide awoke, 3 A.M
Prolly touch down when the sun come in
Aye, when them guards hit the gate

I come from the land where we swing our cars
Figure 8 Benz concrete leave marks
Call it paid, super-charged
Back to back race the Benz with the four door Porsche

Hella smoke says she wanna fuck with me
Money on my mind, ain't nothin' for free
Tryna keep up with me, but it's nothin' to me

Diamond-certified, I ain't never lied
I ain't had L's since Pac died

Why should I make them hide?
But I won't hold you back

Just let me down easy
And go softly when you leave…

Be gentle with your breaking

320,Land Of Make Believe,"[Verse 1: Matt Brandyberry]
You stand there all alone and try to think of what I said
But this unfamiliar tone just keeps on ringing in your head
Everything you've known is what I'm bringing to an end
The situation that you're in is your creation and it's dead
It's what it is, enough of this, the shit you talk is nothing kid

And when the ashes rest you'll see
I've torn you from the land of make-believe

[Verse 2: Matt Brandyberry]
I wish you had the courage and the heart to use your brain
'Cause you're wicked on the surface and you're partially insane
Your thinking serves no purpose, and it's harmfully in vane
Your slippers, they ain't working, and your home's too far away
Now you're stuck, you're outta luck, you stand there thinking how the fuck
It's clouding up, surrounding us, your house is spinning round above
Now the flood of sounds enough to show your throat you found your gut
And now you've spun around the gun, show's me the one the coward was

Through the long lonely nights, she filled my sleep
Her body softly swaying to that smoky beat
Down on mainstreet
Down on mainstreet

[Verse 2]
In the pool halls, the hustlers and the losers
I used to watch 'em through the glass
Well I'd stand outside at closing time
Just to watch her walk on past
Unlike all the other ladies, she looked so young and sweet
As she made her way alone down that empty street
Down on mainstreet
Down on mainstreet

'long came Wild Billy with his friend G-man all duded up for Saturday night
Well Billy slammed on his coaster brakes and said anybody wanna go on up to Greasy Lake
It's about a mile down on the dark side of route eighty-eight
I got a bottle of rose so let's try it
We'll pick up Hazy Davy and Killer Joe and I'll take you all out to where the gypsy angels go
They're built like light

And they dance like spirits in the night (All night) in the night (All night)
Oh, you don't know what they can do to you
Spirits in the night (All night), in the night (All night)
Stand right up now and let it shoot through you

[Verse 2]
Well now Wild young Billy was a crazy cat and he shook some dust out of his coonskin cap
He said, ""Try some of this it'll show you where you're at, or at least it'll help you really feel it""
By the time we made it up to Greasy Lake I had my head out the window and Janey's fingers were in the cake
I think I really dug her cause I was too loose to fake
I said, ""I'm hurt,"" she said, ""Honey, let me heal it""
And we danced all night to a soul fairy band
And she kissed me just right like only a lonely angel can

[Chorus]
She felt so nice, just as soft as a spirit in the night (All night)
In the night (All night), Janey don't know what she do to you
Like a spirit in the night (All night), in the night (All night)
Stand right up and let her shoot through me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Now the night was bright and the stars threw light on Billy and Davy
Dancin' in the moonlight
They were down near the water in a stone mud fight
Killer Joe gone passed out on the lawn
Well now Hazy Davy got really hurt, he ran into the lake in just his socks and a shirt
Me and Crazy Janey was makin' love in the dirt singin' our birthday songs
Janey said it was time to go
So we closed our eyes and said goodbye to gypsy angel row, felt so right

327,The Pride (Part I),"[Verse 1]
Only the young and the innocent
Are born with trusting souls
When light is strong to nurture them
By example of they know
But I had to learn before my time
That beneath your many masks
Therein the darkness deep within
I fell victim to your past

[Pre-Chorus]
And I have lost
And you have taken
And I have learnt
The hardest way

My heart is breaking
My world is crashing to the floor
The part you've taken
Is not forgiving anymore
And some would say
That's the price I've had to pay

[Verse 2]
I heard you release the demon
Locked the door and eat the key
With every blowing nightmare screaming
You may as well have been kidding me

[Pre-Chorus]
And I have lost
And you have taken
And I have learnt
The hardest way

[Chorus]
My heart is breaking
My world is crashing to the floor
The part you've taken
Is not forgiving anymore

I took it to the limit
But you were never really to stay
Some would say
That's the price I've had to pay

Forgiveness is earned
Lessons are learned
I was the weak one
But I am stronger now
So much stronger now

332,On The Border,"[Chorus]
The fishing boats go out across the evening water
Smuggling guns and arms across the Spanish border
The wind whips up the waves so loud
The ghost moon sails among the clouds
Turns the rifles into silver on the border

[Verse 1]
On my wall the colours of the maps are running
From Africa the winds they talk of changes coming
The torches flare up in the night
The hand that sets the farms alight
Has spread the word to those who're waiting on the border

[Verse 2]
In the village where I grew up
Nothing seems the same
Still you never see the change from day to day
And no-one notices the customs slip away

[Verse 3]
Late last night the rain was knocking at my window
I moved across the darkened room and in the lampglow
I thought I saw down in the street
The spirit of the century
Telling us that we're all standing on the border

[Verse 4]
In the islands where I grew up
Nothing seems the same
It's just the patterns that remain
An empty shell
But there's a strangeness in the air you feel too well

Of how I'd say to you

'Cause I had never loved a man
Before

And I guess the tears were falling
'Cause the little girl was lost
But now love
I'm not crying any more

And I've dreamed of this moment
All my life

This girl has turned into a woman

For your tenderness

I've never a man
Lying on my pillow
I've never seen your body
Without clothes

I can't believe
These feelings I've discovered
Though I'm sure it's just
What every lover knows

Now I'm offering to you
I make a promise
And? Was gone tomorrow
Don't pretend

But right now I'm in love
And that's all I'm thinking of
And I hope this feeling
Never ever ends

I been waitin' all night for this moment
I been waitin' all year for this moment
I been picturing you takin' off your clothes for me
I been literally curvin' all these hoes for you
Daddy told you, better bring your ass home
Cinderella better get your ass home
Man I swear the parents just don't understand
You ain't gotta be old to be a man
Take my hand, come with me to my room
Girl I got a suite at the SLS
I already know you got expensive taste
Take my hand, follow me to my room
Tell your little friends you gon' be alright
Girl I got a plan for the whole night

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Okay your legs like a store they open up
And you got people in line
Been here every night for weeks at a time
You in my dreams, that's why I sleep all the time
Just to hear you say I love you, just to touch you
Just to leave you behind
I told you, you don't have to worry, you'll be fine
The type of thing I heard it happen all the time
Yeah, I just wanna see you fly
Because your fragrance got me faded, you be keepin' me high
Said nothin' better than the first time
I'll be at your service like the check-in at the curbside
You don't have to spend another second on this Earth dry
Wet you like a rebel, go a second and a third time
Left you a perverse mind
And when you hungry, I can chef you up a stir fry
Get you some dessert wine, elevate  yah third eye
First prize, Nobel, get a piece
Your clothes off, turn around, let me see

Yeah, okay I came up with a plan, it was take you by the hand
And bring you somewhere where the sand is
Soon as we landed
We went straight into the room
And played the music, started dancing
You was taking off your pants
It look like Dorothy ain't in Kansas anymore
I do you like a chore
We started on the bed and then we moved it to the floor
You started getting crazy, told me fuck you like a whore
I thought you was an angel, now you yellin' to the Lord
You used to tell me all the time I ain't your type
Now you always wanna spend the night
Now I'm doing everything you like
When I'm inside your pussy, damn it feels so right
Yeah, but I still respect the game
Every time I'm out of line you always set me straight
The sex is great, for Heaven's sake I need it every day
I yell your name, Cinderella
Never gonna find nobody better, all my life...

No tongue's drier than mine
I'll come when I get back

Eagle flew out of the night
He was something to observe
Came in close, I heard a voice
Standing stretching every nerve
Had to listen, had no choice

[Chorus 1]
I did not believe the information
I just had to trust imagination
My heart going boom boom boom
""Son,"" he said
""Grab your things, I've come to take you home""

[Verse 2]
To keep in silence I resigned
My friends would think I was a nut
Turning water into wine
Open doors would soon be shut
So I went from day to day
Though my life was in a rut
'Til I thought of what I'd say
Which connection I should cut

[Chorus 2]
I was feeling part of the scenery
I walked right out of the machinery
My heart going boom boom boom
""Hey,"" he said
""Grab your things, I've come to take you home""
Ay, back home

[Verse 3]
When illusion spin her net
I'm never where I want to be
And liberty she pirouette
When I think that I am free
Watched by empty silhouettes
Who close their eyes but still can see
No one taught them etiquette
I will show another me

[Chorus 3]
Today I don't need a replacement
I'll tell them what the smile on my face meant

KEITH: Hello everybody, Keith Croft along with Bobby Payne bringing the best of the GameCrazy of the GameCrazy Selling Skills Challenge. That's where talent, skills, knowledge, and great value come together to create the ultimate games destination.

BOBBY: That's right Keith, we're going to see some serious competition up here today. They're going to give it all they got to be successful out there. Because today's game isn't about scoring points, getting kills, or saving the universe from alien domination. No, Keith, today's game is all about selling.

KEITH: That's right, Bobby, but the kind of selling we're talking about isn't high pressure or some loud obnoxious pitch. At GameCrazy, selling is about identifying needs, building relationships, and maximising the gaming experience for our guests.

BOBBY: And it's all done by focusing on five key selling areas: Hardware, Used Games, MVP, Trades, and Pre-Orders. So let's go down to the game where Zelda Scott will take us through our keys to the game. Zelda?
Keys to the GameVideo transitions to Zelda, standing in front of the game collection. All lines below are spoken by her.

Thanks K. C. and B. P. I'm down here in the hizzouse, you know, the heezy, with the G. C. Posse to get the 411 on GameCrazy. Let's start with the hardware. This is like a gamer's ride, dawg. And if you sell them the right ride, you got a better chance of selling some 20-inch chrome rims later, know what I'm saying?

The key here is to sell them the system that's right for them so that they'll keep coming back for more accessories and games. And speaking of games, GameCrazy's got all the fly new game titles, but we've also got the mad hook up when it comes to used games, and they can't hate on our used games because they play like new, come with a 90-day guarantee, and they cost less, booyah!

Now, for the real hardcore playas, the ones that are crazy tight with the G. C., we've got the MVP card. The MVP card means upfront revenue for GameCrazy, and higher trade values, special discounts, and exclusive tournaments for the players. Trades are where GameCrazy makes crazy dollars, and players can get mad values. It also means that the GameCrazy's got the used game hookups on the latest games.

And finally, pre-orders, now this is  for the real serious players, the ones you've got to get the new games first and beat them before anyone else. They can check out our reserve now board, check out our products licks in the reserve now binder. Put $5 down, and they've got a reservation at the hottest game spot in town, GameCrazy.

Well, that's it from down on the floor y'all. This is Zelda Scott and those are the Keys to the Game. Peace out.

Video transitions to Keith Croft, standing in the front of the store entrance.

KEITH: Oh, thanks, Zelda. And now, let's get ready to rumble as we begin the GameCrazy Sales Challenge with Hardware sale.
HardwareRYAN: Hi, welcome to GameCrazy.

ANN: Hi.

RYAN: Hi, what's something you're interested in today?

ANN: Um, it's my son's birthday, and I'm looking for some good video games but I'm really not sure what he wants.

RYAN: Alright, what system does he play on?

KEITH (background): Oh, and here he goes asking the right questions.

BOBBY (background): He's off to a good start, Keith.

ANN: System, you know what? That's what I need, I need a system, and some video games. Um, sorry, I'm just all brand new to this.

RYAN: No, it's fine. Basically, there's three platforms to pick from. You have an Xbox, a PlayStation 2, and a Gamecube, but to figure out which one is right for you, I'm gonna have to ask you a couple of questions. So how old is your son?

ANN: He's turning 12 and he's in middle school.

RYAN: Okay, what kind of games does he like to play?

ANN: His favourite is driving games.

RYAN: How about DVD movies?

KEITH (background): Critical movie question.

BOBBY (background): Ah, the kids love the movies, Keith.

ANN: He does have a TV, and it will be in his room, so, you know, that would be great.

RYAN: How about online play?

ANN: Uh, you know, I'm not so comfortable with that.

RYAN: You know, actually, it's pretty safe and secure but I understand your concerns.

BOBBY (background): Really did a nice job with keepin' things movin'.

RYAN: How about friends, will he have friends over?

ANN: Absolutely. He has two or three buddies that I know he'll have over.

RYAN: Alright, so based on what you're telling me. I'll probably recommend a Sony PlayStation 2. It has some great racing titles, he can play four players at once, he can play DVD movies, and if he wants the best online system, you can definitely tap into it later on down the line, if you decide to go that route.

BOBBY (background): Ah, great suggestion, what a lucky kid.

ANN: Wow, sounds great. I think that's what I need.

RYAN: Oh, it's a great choice. Basically we're gonna do is put some great accessories, a DVD remote, a wireless controller, and we're gonna have to get you some memory cards to get you started.

ANN: Perfect.

RYAN: Okay.

KEITH (background): And there's the add-on.

BOBBY (background): He's really selling that ultimate gaming experience, Keith.

The video transitions to Ryan standing next to Zelda.

KEITH (background): Let's go down to the floor with Zelda, who's standing by with Ryan.

ZELDA: Ry-dawg, that was the bomb-diggity, my friend. How'd you do it, dawg?

RYAN: Well, Zelda, actually, it was very simple. I just found out what she was looking for. I needed to know who was going to play the system, what kind of games someone's gonna be playing, what she could afford, and then what kind of features she might want later on down the line. I suggested the right system with the right accessories, built trust and a relationship, and after that, it was easy.

ZELDA: Well, you certainly made look that way, dawg. There you have it, back to you K. C.

Video transitions to Keith Croft, standing in the front of the store entrance, holding his finger in his ear.

KEITH: Oh, thank you, Zelda. And now, on to our next challenge when high margins and great values come together, it's Used Games.
Used GamesGAIL: Hey, how's it going? Welcome to GameCrazy, what can I help you find?

KEN: Do you guys have that new Madden 2004?

GAIL: Madden fan, huh?

KEITH (background): Madden, a very popular title.

BOBBY (background): It certainly is, Keith.

GAIL: Actually, yeah. I have it over here new but, you know what? I have it over there used for 10 bucks less.

KEN: Yeah, I don't know about you. It sounds sketchy, could be broken.

GAIL: Well, no. You know, our used games play just as well as our new games and they come with a 90-day guarantee, so if it doesn't play, you just bring it on back to me.

KEN: Yeah, I still don't know.

GAIL: You know what, Why don't we go try it out?

KEN: Really?

GAIL: Yeah, come on in.

Video transitions to a video preview of the Madden 2002 gameplay.

GAIL: So, what you'd think?

KEN: Looks good, I'm hooked up on this used thing.

KEITH (background): Sold!

BOBBY (background): The demo always clinches it.

GAIL: Great, well, if you like that, I've also got ESPN Football used and NCAA…

KEN: Bring it on!

The video transitions to Gail standing next to Zelda.

KEITH (background): Zelda, what's her secret?

ZELDA: Hey, girlfriend. What's the deally, yo?

GAIL: Well, Zelda, used games are just a great value. When I told him about his savings and the 90-day guarantee, it just really got his interest. The demo was just to reassure him he was getting a quality product. That was the clincher.

ZELDA: Well, big ups to you, girl. That was off the heezy fo' sheezy. K-money?

Video transitions to Keith Croft, standing in the front of the store entrance.

KEITH: Thank you, Zelda. And now, let's get back to the fundamentals with Trades.
TradesGAIL: Okay, so one new copy of Ninja Gaiden. Bet you're going to try to beat this today, huh?

ARRON: I usually like to buy a game when it's brand new, take it home and beat it. I usually buy my stuff over at Best Buy but I figured I'd give you guys a try.

KEITH (background): A possible big box convert?

BOBBY (background): Could be, Keith, could be.

GAIL: Oh, so you're new to GameCrazy. Do you know about our [?
by-play ?] trade thing?

ARRON: No, what's that?

GAIL: Well, it's really what we're all on about. It sounds like you're the kind of guy who likes to beat a game as soon as you get it, so this is perfect for you. You could take all those game that you've already beaten, trade them in for credit for anything else that you want.

ARRON: I mean, I can take the games I've got at home, bring 'em in, trade 'em in, and get new games for less?

GAIL: That's right.

ARRON: I can't do that over at Best Buy, I'm definitely coming here to get all my games.

GAIL: Great, well in that case, you're definitely gonna need an MVP card.

KEITH (background): MVP? Did I hear that right? Zelda, what's going on down there?

ZELDA: You heard it right, K-dawg. Gail is getting extremely jiggy with it by going for the MVP. Let's see what happens.
MVPARRON: So, what's the MVP card?

GAIL: Well, the MVP card is our membership card that's made for hardcore gamers, it'll save you some serious cash.

ARRON: How's that?

BOBBY (background): She's gonna have to do the math for him.

GAIL: Well, you know about all the old games that you have at home? You bring 'em in, and with an MVP card, you get 10% more value for your trade-ins and then additional 10% off anything that you want to buy in the store that's used.

ARRON: Okay, so how much is that gonna run me?

GAIL: Well, the MVP card is, um, it's about 20 bucks.

ARRON: Yeah, I don't know.

GAIL: Look, you're serious gamer, so you're gonna already spend a lot of cash here, and, um, this way, as an MVP, you can buy more and play more.

ARRON: That makes sense but, I mean, it's 20 bucks.

GAIL: We also have special deals every month that are exclusive for MVP customers, and we have exclusive game tournaments only for MVPs.

ARRON: What, what kind of tournaments?

GAIL: Actually, we have a Soulcalibur tournament coming up this weekend.

ARRON: Soulcalibur? All right, you got me.

KEITH (background): She clenches it with the tournament.

BOBBY (background): This guy is psyched about GameCrazy!

ARRON: Sign me up for the tournament and give me one of the MVP cards too.

GAIL: Great, you'll be glad you did.

KEITH (background): Zelda, she really came up with a big play there.

ZELDA: You know it, K. C. Give it up, G-unit. You showed some mad skills there, first with the trades, and then the MVP, you go girl! How'd you do it?

GAIL: Well, Zelda, trades are a real eye-opener, especially for a new guest. Never miss the opportunity to tell our new guest about the trading. Once they realise how much farther their gaming dollars go, they never go back to the big box.

ZELDA: And that MVP, that was crunk.

GAIL: Well, the MVP card. I mean, once the guy realised how quickly it would pay for itself, it was a no-brainer. The guy's a hardcore gamer, so, I mean it just made sense for him. And the tournament, that put him over the top.

ZELDA: True dat, girl. Home slices?

KEITH: Truly spectacular, Zelda. Now let's see if Ryan can sell a value that can't be seen as we move on to the Pre-Order.

Walk in the liquor store like where the patrón, I need a whole case

Or the bottom of the yacht in St. Tropez
So, pop the rosé, ok, ok

She like slow man, she my snow flake
Don't smoke chronic, but she can sniff the whole eighth
Her Columbian. Like Scarface
And we ain't gotta fuck. She all face
She from the valley, somewhere in Cali
My homie Snoop used to fuck with her sister Sally
I pulled over in the alley
She shift my gears and whispered in my ear

This new position that I'm thinkin', let me demonstrate it
Ay, Ain't gotta fornicate
And your performance is important when you use your face
Ay, She never used to be this way
She was a les 'til I went ahead and screwed her straight
Ay, undo your bra with one hand
If anything is gonna care it on and cum can
Cum again, invite 'em if you have any fun friends
I love it when it's girl upon girl with one man
Ay, put your butt on my mustache, fuck that
Won't eat unless your shavin' the muff back, puff pass
Rub 'em from the front to the butt crack

Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
I was soaring ever higher
But I flew too high
Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think I still was a mad man
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming
I can hear them say

My charade is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a wise man, well
It surely means that I don't know

Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune
But I hear the voices say

388,The First Cut Is The Deepest,"I would have given you all of my heart
But there's someone who's torn it apart
And she's takin' almost all that I've got
But if you want, I'll try to love again
Baby, I'll try to love again but I know

The first cut is the deepest, baby, I know
The first cut is the deepest
'Cause when it comes to bein' lucky, she's cursed
When it comes to lovin' me, she's worst
But when it comes to bein' loved, she's first
That's how I know
The first cut is the deepest, baby, I know
The first cut is the deepest

I still want you by my side
Just to help me dry the tears that I've cried
'Cause I'm sure gonna give you a try
And if you want, I'll try to love again
But baby, I'll try to love again, but I know

The first cut is the deepest, baby, I know
The first cut is the deepest
'Cause when it comes to bein' lucky, she's cursed
When it comes to lovin' me, she's worst
But when it comes to bein' loved, she's first
That's how I know
The first cut is the deepest, baby, I know
The first cut is the deepest

Baby, I know, the first cut is the deepest
Baby, I know, the first cut is the deepest
'Cause when it comes to bein' lucky, she's cursed
When it comes to lovin' me, she's worst
But when it comes to bein' loved, she's first
That's how I know
The first cut is the deepest, baby, I know",Cat Stevens,1977,"[56, 22, 21, 22, 23, 27, 29, 31, 34, 38, 46, 77]",12

[Verse 1]
They say I'm too young to love you
I don't know what I need
They think I don't understand
The freedom land of the seventies
I think I'm too cool to know ya
You say I'm like the ice I freeze
I'm churning out novels like
Beat poetry on Amphetamines

[Pre-Chorus]
I say
I say

[Chorus]
Well, my boyfriend's in a band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair
I get down to Beat poetry
And my jazz collection's rare
I can play most anything
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby

[Verse 2]
They say I'm too young to love you
They say I'm too dumb to sing
They judge me like a picture book
By the colors, like they forgot to read
I think we're like fire and water
I think we're like the wind and sea
You're burning up, I'm cooling down
You're up, I'm down
You're blind, I see

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm free
I'm free

[Chorus]
Well, my boyfriend's in a band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair
I get down to Beat poetry
And my jazz collection's rare
I can play most anything
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby

[Bridge]
I'm talking about my generation
Talking about that newer nation
And if you don't like it
You can beat it
Beat it, baby
You never liked the way I said it
If you don't get it, then forget it
'Cause I don't have to fucking explain it

[Chorus]
And my boyfriend's in a band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair
I get high on hydroponic weed
And my jazz collection's rare
I get down to Beat poetry
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby

Pa-da-pa-pa, pa-de-da
Te-de-de, da-da-ah

392,At Midnight (My Love Will Lift You Up),"You said you won't
I bet my neck, I bet you will
I'm gonna check my love
You I'm gonna thrill
Can't imagine what you've missed
Can't go on
Meet me at midnight in the light that starts the love

Since there's was you
I changed my mind about it all
Instead of goin' on

I'm gonna settle for a fall
My love, my love will lift you up, up, up

You came into my life and now I realize
Today we love, we might, but it is for sure at midnight

Since there's was you
I changed my mind about it all
Instead of goin' on

You came into my life and now I realize
Today we love, we might, but it is for sure at midnight

393,You're Throwing A Good Love Away,"[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
Jarren is the type that murders a mic
Then after the show get coked up, go home, murder his wife
Lee do you rest on a red eye flight
One with Jheri Curls and a beard lay low for 38 nights
Geez I'm buggin'
Word to my cousin
Walk holding my wood like Hacksaw Jim Duggan
Searching for a young bitch to give a good lovin'
Love, fuck, and stay away from whores who hate dick suckin'
Retreat back in the street with plenty of heat
Off of the chain like Kunta Kinte's feet
Gave dirty piss to my PO
Now I'm back in the joint
Jackin' punks for phone time like Miss Cleo
Keep crack stuffed in a big bag of Cheetos
Only one of me goes that's the chrome Desert Eagle
Blow!
All I need in this life is sin
Methamphetamines, paper, and pen
Oops I did it again
Severed your skull and spilled blood on my Tims
Call me Tarzan, this nigga's going out on a limb
Get it?
Vote for Jarren, A-Town's ambassador
Fuck rims, bitch, my car has a flux capacitor
The most eligible bachelor
Caveman, see a bitch I want and tackle her
Rick James, beat a bitch up and shackle her
Undisputed champ, stomp a hole in the challenger

[Verse 2: Ness Lee]
Listen
To get rid of Ness you'll probably need to find a cure for hustle
When I grind it's like you flunked the piss test
You're in trouble
The flow is like there's strings attached to it
Since hip hop's dead, well I'm bringing back music
My CD is that foolish
It evokes the emotions that make folks on Jerry Springer act stupid
I swing a bat ruthless
And beat a cat clueless
And reenact the featured act to it
For being wack I'll leave your ass toothless
The rhino's here
I'm dancing like Michael Jackson in rhinestone gear
Your man used to hold weight, well lipo's here
Holding a 9 and throwing pine cone shells
And don't think that your little threats scare me
Cause I know fear
And I no fear it's my show
Yeah I'm ice cold
Like Dolemite
The lion's share of y'all should name your CDs
Jimmy crack corn cause I don't care
You eyeing fierce with iron
But irony here
Is I know queer is behind those stares
Not enough iron in your diet hear?
I am psycho, weird
I might chase you while you climb those stairs
And if I can't cut you dawg, I might throw chairs
A cyclone in a rifle barrel, they like no
And y'all slow, get your typos cleared
Even your blood type is type 0, shea

394,Arrested For Driving While Blind,"[Verse]
I'm going to tell ya what it's all about
When you're driving down the highway at night
And you're feeling that wild turkey's bite
Don't give johnny walker a ride
Cause jack black is right by your side
You might get taken to the jailhouse and find
You've been arrested for driving while blind
Now just the other night with nothing to do
We broke a case of proof 102
And started itching for that wonderful feel
Of rolling in an automobile
You could say we was out of our mind
And let me tell you we were flying while blind
Then they had us up against the wall
Hey it's only blood grain alcohol
And there ain't no cause for alarm
We ain't out to do nobody no harm
How could anyone be so unkind
To arrest a man for driving while blind",ZZ Top,1977,"[91, 91, 92, 92, 93, 94]",6

It's the same two step wit a li'l twist
Listen, pimpin', I ain't new to this, I'm true to this
Pay attention, boy, I'll teach you how to do this shit
You mix a little Cris' with a little Dom Perignon
And a little Hennessy, you know we finna carry on

Cause I stay grindin', uh-huh
Homie, you can catch me swooping
Bentley coupin' switching lanes, haha
If you see me rolling, you know I'm holding
I'm bout my paper, yeah
Nigga, I'm serious, I ain't playing
I'll embed it in your brain, I'm off the chain, G-Unit

396,Night Moves,"{intro}

I was a little too tall
Could've used a few pounds
Tight pants points hardly renown
She was a black haired beauty with big dark eyes
And points all her own sitting way up high

{hook}

Way up firm and high

Out past the cornfields where the woods got heavy
Out in the back seat of my '60 Chevy
Workin' on mysteries without any clues
Workin' on our night moves
Trying' to make some front page drive-in news
Workin' on our night moves in the summertime
In the sweet summertime

We weren't in love oh no far from it
We weren't searchin’ for some pie in the sky summit
We were just young and restless and bored
Living by the sword
And we'd steal away every chance we could
To the backroom, the alley, the trusty woods
I used her she used me
But neither one cared
We were getting our share

Workin' on our night moves
Trying to lose the awkward teenage blues
Workin' on our night moves
In the summertime
In the sweet summer time, summer time

{Bridge}

And oh the wonder
Felt the lightning
And we waited on the thunder
Waited on the thunder

I woke last night to the sound of thunder
How far off I sat and wondered
Started humming a song from 1962
Ain't it funny how the night moves
When you just don't seem to have as much to lose
Strange how the night moves
With autumn closing in

[Chorus]
When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hopin' that I can borrow
A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck
Had went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands
My plan's rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back, whispering ""Get 'em!""
I got 'em and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a youngin
In pajamas and dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb
Niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted
This Piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever
And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop, I hope— [Gunshots]

Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Verse 2]
You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it Section.80
The message resembled ""Brenda's Got a Baby""
What's crazy was I was hearin' about it
But doubted your ignorance
How could you ever just put her on blast and shit?
Judgin' her past and shit?
Well, it's completely my future
Her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit
And I'ma need that forty dollars
Even if I got to fuck, suck and swallow
In the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed
By a married man, and father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys
Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em
Back to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'
Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted, but fuck that ""Sorry for your loss"" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait… Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate
And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'
I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'
You lyin' to these motherfuckers
Talkin' about you can help 'em with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit...

[Chorus]
When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I look in the mirror
And ask myself: Am I really scared of passin' away?
If it's today, I hope I hear a
Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'
The scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed
May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about, ’cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
In a direction to speak on somethin'
That's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like ""It need to be told""
Cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'
Or steady bein' distracted by money, drugs and 4-5's
I count lives, all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in?

[Chorus]
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh

""Fuck! I'm tired of this shit! I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit! My brother, homie!""

[Verse 1]
Tired of runnin', tired of huntin'
My own kind, but retirin' nothin'
Tires are steady screechin', the driver is rubbin'
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst?

[Verse 2]
Dope on the corner, look at the coroner
Daughter is dead, mother is mournin' her
Stray bullets, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waitin' patiently, but they couldn't
Bring her back, who got the footage?
Channel 9, cameras is lookin'
It's hard to channel your energy when you know he crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

[Verse 3]
How many sins? I'm runnin' out
How many sins? I lost count
Dreams of ballin' like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper callin', I'm cottonmouth
Money is power (Money is power)
Yours is ours (Yours is ours)
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song, a black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst, dye your thirst, dye your thirst

[Verse 4]
What are we doin'? Who are we foolin'?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
Tired of runnin', choirs is hummin'
Tell us to visit, we lie about comin'
Now back to business, loadin' the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feudin'
The beef is bubblin', it's no discussion
Hereditary, all of my cousins
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

[Verse 5]
Too many sins, I'm runnin' out
Somebody send me a well for the drought
See all I know is takin' notes
On takin' this life for granted, granted, if he provoke
My best days, I stress days
(Lord, forgive me for all my sins, for I not know—)
My best days, I stress days
Say ""fuck the world,"" my sex slave
Money, pussy, and greed – what's my next crave?
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of runnin', tired of runnin', tired of tumblin'
Tired of runnin', tired of tumblin' – backwards
My momma say ""See, a pastor give me a promise
What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished?
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dyin' of thirst, you dyin' of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works.""

Fuck! I’m tired of this shit!
I’m tired of fuckin' runnin', I’m tired of this shit!
That’s my brother, homie!
Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?
I know that's not what I think that is
Why are you so angry?
See, you young men are dying of thirst
Do you know what that means?
That means you need water, holy water
You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord
Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?
Okay, repeat after me:
""Lord God, I come to You a sinner.""
(Lord God, I come to You a sinner)
""And I humbly repent for my sins.""
(And I humbly repent for my sins)
""I believe that Jesus is Lord.""
(I believe that Jesus is Lord)
""I believe you raised Him from the dead.""
(I believe you raised Him from the dead)
""I would ask that Jesus come into my life.""
(I would ask that Jesus come in my life)
""And be my Lord and Savior.""
(And be my Lord and Savior)
""I receive Jesus to take control of my life.""
(I receive Jesus to take control of my life)
""And that I may live for Him from this day forward.""
(And that I may live for Him from this day forward)

For saving me with Your precious blood.""

For saving me with Your precious blood)

406,Sailing Ships,"Do you remember
Standing on the shore
Head in the clouds
Your pockets filled with dreams
Bound for glory
On the seven seas of life
But, the ocean is deeper than it seems

The wind was with you
When you left on the morning tide
You set your sail for an island in the sun
On the horizon, dark clouds up ahead
For the storm has just begun

Take me with you
Take me far away
Lead me to the distant shore

Sail your ship across the water
Spread your wings across the sky
Take the time to see
You're the one who holds the key
Or sailing ships will pass you by

You cry for mercy
When you think you've lost your way
You drift alone, if all your hope is gone
So find the strength and you will see
You control, your destiny
After all is said and done

So take me with you
Take me far away
An' lead me to the distant shore

Sail your ship across the water
Spread your wings across the sky
Take the time to see
You're the one who holds the key
Or sailing ships will pass
Sailing ships will pass you
Sailing ships will pass you by...

Take me with you
Take me far away
We'll ride the wind across the sky
Spread your wings and you will see
You control, your destiny
So sailing ships don't pass you by

So take me with you
Take me far away
We'll ride the wind across the sky
Spread your wings and you will see
You control, your destiny
So sailing ships don't pass
So sailing ships don't pass you
So sailing ships don't pass you by...

You'll find that you're the only one

Are the voices in your head calling, Gloria?

You don't have to answer
Leave them hangin' on the line

Will you meet him on the main line
Or will you catch him on the rebound?
Will you marry for the money
Take a lover in the afternoon?
Feel your innocence slipping away
Don't believe it's comin' back soon

410,Torn Between Two Lovers,"There are times when a woman has to say what's on her mind
Even though she knows how much it's gonna hurt
Before I say another word let me tell you, I love you
Let me hold you close and say these words as gently as I can

There's been another man that I've needed and I've loved
But that doesn't mean I love you less
And he knows he can't possess me and he knows he never will
There's just this empty place inside of me that only he can fill

Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules
Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' you both is breakin' all the rules

You mustn't think you've failed me
Just because there's someone else
You were the first real love I ever had
And all the things I ever said
I swear they still are true
For no one else can have the part of me I gave to you

Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules
Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' you both is breakin' all the rules

I couldn't really blame you if you turned and walked away
But with everything I feel inside, I'm asking you to stay

Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules

Envy is a sign of admiration
Hate: It’s the epitome of destruction

Tal parece que mi amor crece y crece, pero tú desvaneces
Y  me ofreces tu amistad sin otra excepción
Sé que hay otro hombre que ha logrado lo que yo jamás a ti te di
Un hogar, una familia, un buen porvenir; perdón por hacerte daño

[Coro: Romeo Santos]
Y por ti vivo aniquilado en el despecho
Reprimido, ardiendo por los celos
Lo odio aunque él te haga feliz
A mí nada me intimida
Pero entiendo que él gano la guerra hace tiempo
Y se me olvida que ya te perdí

[Verso 2: Drake, Drake & Romeo Santos, Romeo Santos]
Celo sus besos sobre tu cuerpo
La envidia se apodera así de mí y te quiero aquí
Odio ese hombre porque está a tu lado
Perdí tu amor, soy un pobre diablo
Sin tu amor yo no soy nada, nada

Y por ti vivo aniquilado en el despecho

You've been the one from the moment I seen you
Sometimes I question if this is all real
Then I grab on that ass and I firmly believe it
And you look like you drawn by an artist
No you, you look like Bernice and Yaris
But both put together, those are some girls that I know from back home
If you saw 'em you'd get it
Look don't worry about it, keep speakin' Spanish
I'll get it translated, you know you my baby
Anything for you, anything baby

I would just much rather give you a baby
And buy you a house, so I live with you baby

She said 'I suppose you've heard about Alice.'
So, I rushed to the window, and I looked outside
And I could hardly believe my eyes

I don't why why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go
I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't wanna know
'Cause for twenty four years I've been living next door to Alice
Twenty four years, just waitin' for a chance
To tell her how I'm feeling, maybe get a second glance
Now I've gotta get used to not living next door to Alice

Carved our initials deep in the bark...
Me and Alice
Now she walks to the door with her head held high
And just for a moment, I caught her eye
As the big limousine pulled slowly out of Alice's drive

I don't why why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go

Feelin like I'm already your man so...

[HOOK: K-Young]",Wiz Khalifa,1977,"[99, 68, 53, 53, 55, 56, 57, 59, 59, 61, 63, 67, 74, 81, 83]",15
419,Crackerbox Palace,"[Verse 1]
I was so young when I was born
My eyes could not yet see
And by the time of my first dawn
Somebody holding me they said

[Chorus]cI welcome you to Crackerbox Palace
We've been expecting you
You bring such joy in Crackerbox Palace
No matter where you roam know our love is true

[Verse 2]
While growing up or trying to
Not knowing where to start
I looked around for someone who
May help reveal my heart - someone said
While you're a part of Crackerbox Palace
Do what the rest all do
Or face the fact that Crackerbox Palace
May have no other choice than to deport you

[Chorus]
I welcome you to Crackerbox Palace
We've been expecting you
You bring such joy in Crackerbox Palace
No matter where you roam know our love is true

[Verse 3]
Some times are good, some times are bad
That's all a part of life
And standing in between them all
I met a Mr. Grief - and he said

[Chorus]
I welcome you to Crackerbox Palace
Was not expecting you
Let's rap and tap at Crackerbox Palace
Know that the Lord is well and inside of you",George Harrison,1977,"[62, 41, 19, 20, 24, 26, 30, 34, 39, 49, 66]",11
420,I'll Be Standing By,"Price / Peverett - Riff Bros. Music - ASCAP

Standing in the shadows
Waiting for your love light to shine on me
When you're lonely and the pain shows
Call me, I'll be right there to set you free

Walking down a dark road to loneliness
The night has no mercy
I feel a need in me I can't express

I'll be standing by
I'll be standing by
I'll be standing by

Come to me, when you're lonely
You need someone to love, let it be me
The way you love me and hold me
Made me realize how sweet love can be

Standing on a backstreet in the falling rain
Cryin' for mercy, until you come to me and ease the pain

I'll be standing by
I'll be standing by
I'll be standing by

{Rod - Solo}

I'll be standing by
I'll be standing by
I'll be standing by

I'll be standing by
There'll be no need to cry
I'll be standing by

Come to me, come to me
'Cause I'll be standing - I'll be standing by",Foghat,1977,"[67, 68, 73]",3
421,You Know Like I Know,"(GUITAR & PIANO INTRO)

To take a look and walk away

Isn't a stand man

To speak the words that everyone's heard

Isn't the way man

Everybody knows

All things must come and go

But

You know like I know that

Everything's gonna be alright

People just come and go

They don't know what's right

Till they're gone

Your sun will rise and set today

Just don't you worry

And everything will come your way

Just don't you hurry

Take a little time

And find you some peace of mind

Then

You'll know like I know that

Everything's gonna be alright

People just come and go

They don't know what's right

Till they're gone

Nah-nah-nah

Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah

Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah

Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah...

423,All Strung Out On You,"I just can't get enough of you, baby
There just ain't enough of you to go around
And just when I'm needing you, baby
You ain't nowhere to be found
Baby, it's getting' me down, because I'm...

All strung out on you, baby
All strung out on you, baby
All strung out on you, baby
Oh, baby-baby, why can't you love me
Baby-baby be thinkin' of me
Baby-baby I'm all strung out on you

It hurts when you needle me, baby
But I'd rather have the pain then lose your love
I know you're no good for me, baby
But I'll keep trippin' around
Trackin' you all over town, because I'm...

I love you
Just the way you are
Like a little fallen star
I'm gonna catch you someday
(Gonna catch you someday)
And you'll never get away
(Never get away), because I'm...

I'm all strung out on you, baby
All strung out on you, baby
All strung out on you, baby
All strung out on you, baby

(Baby, I'm all strung out)

424,Your Own Special Way,"[Verse 1]
Go far enough and you will reach
A place where the sea runs underneath
And we'll see our shadow, high in the sky
Drying away in the night

[Verse 2]
I've sailed the world for seven years
And left all I love behind in tears
Won't you come here, wherever you are
I've been alone long enough

[Chorus 1]
You, you have your own special way
Of holding my hand keep it way 'bove the water
Don't ever let go--Oh no, no, no

[Chorus 2]
You, you have your own special way
Of turning the world so it's facing
The way, that I'm going, Don't ever
Don't ever stop

[Verse 3]
Whose seen the wind not you or I
But when the ship moves she's passing by
Between you and me I really don't think
She knows where she's going at all

[Chorus 3]
You, you have your own special way
Of carrying me twice round the world
Never closer to home than the day
The day I started

[Chorus 1]
You, you have your own special way
Hold onto my hand keep it way 'bove the water
Don't ever let go--no, no, no

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 4]
What mean the dreams night after night
The man in the moons' a blinding light
Won't you come out whoever you are
You've followed me quiet long enough

Fine self down here by my side

426,Blinded By The Light,"[Hook: Collins]
Blinded by the lights (Blinded by the lights)
Waiting for a sign (Waiting for a sign)
You thought I was fine (Fine, fine, fine)
I'm losing my mind (Mind, mind, mind)

[Verse 1: Futuristic]
Yo, I ain't blinded, I'm finally seeing correctly
I had class until niggas started to test me
I surpassed what everybody I knew was doing
They hope to do it, so I help em' do it and then they left me
Ain't that a bitch, literally that's a bitch
Niggas seen the light and then they felt like they just had to switch
I ain't ask for shit, they looking for an ass to kiss
I'm drunk as fuck with a girl I used to fuck, I'd probably grab her tits
I'm smashing in a whip, navigation, the music blasting
Getting head with my girl on the phone, how could I let this happen
Fuck it, I'm extra spazzing, hit the bathroom for a second
Threw up on my jacket and pissed in the liquor section
And I don't even regret it, that's the worst part
Don't have a purpose, I'm doing whatever sounds fun
The music is something I really used to love
But what do you do when your sounds done, I'm found numb
I bought a gun with intentions to blow my brains out
Took my money out the bank and put it all in envelopes
Gave my mama four, gave my brother five, gave my cousin two
Gave my DJ three, I'm trying to get this pain out
I wondered who would come and get the stains out
Or who would hear it, eventually take the same route
I typed a post on my page for all of my fans
I bet if I actually did I'd have the fame now
And niggas still begging me to put em' on
Begging me to play they songs
Can't you tell I ain't this shit myself
You don't even like my tracks, you ain't bought one hit
But you mad cause you asked, but won't get my help
Stop it, I got my own situations that I've been facing
These dreams that I'm always chasing, but they rarely ever come true
This family that I left, that woman I used to love
So the least of my concerns is you

[Hook: Collins]
Blinded by the lights (Blinded by the lights)
Waiting for a sign (Waiting for a sign)

427,Year Of The Cat,"{Instrumental Lead In}

On a morning from a Bogart movie
In a country where they turn back time
You go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre
Contemplating a crime
She comes out of the sun in a silk dress running
Like a watercolor in the rain
Don't bother asking for explanations
She'll just tell you that she came
In the Year of the Cat

She doesn't give you time for questions
As she locks up your arm in hers
And you follow 'till your sense of which direction
Completely disappears
By the blue tiled walls near the market stalls
There's a hidden door she leads you to
These days, she says, I feel my life
Just like a river running through
The Year of the Cat

Well She looks at you so coolly
And her eyes shine like the moon in the sea
She comes in Incense and Patchouli
So you take her, to find what's waiting inside
The Year of the Cat

{Instrumental Bridge}

Well morning comes and you're still with her
And the bus and the tourists are gone
And you've thrown away your choice and lost your ticket
So you have to stay on
But the drum-beat strains of the night remain
In the rhythm of the new-born day
You know sometime you're bound to leave her
But for now you're going to stay
In the Year of the Cat

428,Here Come Those Tears Again,"Here come those tears again
Just when I was getting over you
Just when I was going to make it through
Another night without missing you
Thinking I might just be strong enough after all
When I hear your footsteps echoing in the hall

Baby here we stand again
Like we've been so many times before
Even though you looked so sure
As I was watching you walking out my door
But you always walk back in like you did today
Acting like you never even went away

Well I don't know if I can
Open up and let you in baby
Here come those tears
Here come those tears again

I can hear you telling me
How you needed to be free
And you had some things to work out alone
Now you're standing here telling me
How you have grown

Here come those tears again
Now you'll tell me how to hold them in
Here come those tears
Here come those tears again

Some other time baby
When I'm strong and feeling fine maybe
When I can look at you without crying
You might look like a friend of mine
But I don't know if I can
Open up enough to let you in
Here come those tears
Here come those tears again
Just walk away
I'm going back inside and turning out those light
And I'll be in the dark but you'll be out of sight",Jackson Browne,1977,"[54, 23, 23, 27, 30, 34, 38, 48, 64]",9

I'm ridin' in a Wraith, feeling like I'm outer space
Stars on my sunroof, Planet of the Apes
I couldn't wait until they released me, right back on the turf
I took off on you bustas, left you right on planet Earth

End up playing Sudoku all the way in Mercury
I took too much of shrooms feel like I'm on Neptune
I'm with an alien, she show me what that neck do

Now it seems year
I'm back in the city
Where nothing is clear
But thoughts of me holding you
Bringing us near

And tell me
When will our eyes meet
When can I touch you
When will this strong yearning end
And when will I hold you again

Time in New England
Took me away
To long rocky beaches
And you, by the bay
We started a story
Whose end must now wait

And, tell me
When will our eyes meet
When can I touch you
When will this strong yearning end
And when will I hold you again

I feel the change comin'
I feel the wind blow
I feel brave and daring
I feel my blood flow

With you
I can bring out
All the love, that I have

So earth ain't so bad

When can I touch you
When will this strong yearning end

2Pac of my generation, blue pill in the fuckin' Matrix
Red rose in the gray pavement
Young black nigga trapped and he can't change it
Know he a genius, he just can't claim it
'Cause they left him no platforms to explain it
He frustrated so he get faded
But deep down inside he know you can't fade him
How long should I stay dedicated?
How long 'til opportunity meet preparation?
I need some real nigga reparations
'Fore I run up in your bank just for recreation

I spent my whole life thinkin' out the box
Boxin' homies three-on-one, got DP'ed but I ain't drop
Chirp on me, here I come, brrt, spin around the block
They blurped on me, said I ran a stop sign but that's a lie
I spent my whole life starin' at the stage
Playin' Sega, daddy smokin' sherm, mama playin' spades
Catchin' vapors, grandma said I'd get some Jordans for my grades
That's my baby, when she died my heart broke a hundred ways
I spent my whole life tryna make it, tryna chase it
The cycle of a black man divided, tryna break it
You take a loss? Shit, don't cry about it, just embrace it
Minor setback for major comeback, that's my favorite
My nigga L said, ""You do a song with Nip, K. Dot he a better Crip""
I said, ""He a man first, you hear the words out his lips
About flourishing from the streets to black businesses?""
Level four, yard livin', given to false imprisonment
Listen close, my nigga
It's bigger than deuces and fours, my nigga
Since elementary we close, my nigga, yeah, straight like that
I give you the game, go back to the turf and give it right back
For generations we been dealt bad hands with bad plans
Prove your dedication by hoppin' out Grand Am's
I'm at the premiere politickin' with Top, Nip, and Snoop
Damn, Pac watchin' the way we grew, from dedication

If it ain't congratulate then it look like what, Nipsey?

Look
This ain't entertainment, it's for niggas on the slave ship
These songs just the spirituals I swam against them waves with
Ended up on shore to they amazement
Now I hope the example I set's not contagious
Lock us behind gates but can't tame us
Used to be, ""Stay safe,"" now it's, ""Stay dangerous""
'Cause ain't no point in playin' defense, nigga
That's why I dove off the deep end, nigga, without a life jacket
Couple mil', tour the world, dawg, my life crackin'
Cook the books, bring it back so it's no taxes
Royalties, publishing, plus I own masters
I'll be damned if I slave for some white crackers
I was mappin' this out, I hit the heist backwards
Hoppin' out the eighty-five in Reebok Classics
Ran a couple marathons just to get established
To make it happen, you got to have it

Hey, this is radio station WSKEE
We're taking calls on the wish line
Making your wacky wishes come true
Hello?

[Hook]
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala

[Verse 1]
I wish I was like six-foot-nine so I can get with Leoshi
'Cause she don't know me but, yo, she's really fine
You know I see her all the time, everywhere I go
And even in my dreams, I can scheme of ways to make her mine
'Cause I know she's livin' phat
Her boyfriend's tall and he plays ball, so how am I gonna compete with that?
'Cause when it comes to playing basketball
I'm always last to be picked and in some cases never picked at all
So I just lean up on the wall
Or sit up in the bleachers with the rest of the girls who came to watch their man ball
Dag y'all! I never understood, black
Why the jocks get the fly girls, and me, I get the hood rats
I tell 'em, ""Scat, skittle, scabobble""
Got hit with a bottle and put in a hospital for talkin' that mess
I confess, it's a shame
When you livin' in a city that's the size of a box and nobody knows yo' name
Glad I came, to my senses
Like quick-quick, got sick-sick to my stomach, overcometh by thoughts
Of me and her together, right?
So when I asked her out, she said I wasn't her type

I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her

I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala

[Verse 2]
I wish I had a brand new car so far, I got this hatchback
And everywhere I go, yo, I gets laughed at
And when I'm in my car I'm laid back
I got an 8-track, and a spare tire in the backseat, but that's flat
And do you really wanna know what's really wack?
See, I can't even get a date, so what do you think of that?
I heard that prom night is a bomb night
With a hood rat t'you can hold tight
But really though, I'm Figaro
When in my car, I can't even get a hello
Well, so many people wanna cruise Crenshaw on Sunday
One day I'mma have to get in my car and go
You know I take the 110 until the 105
Get off at Crenshaw, tell my homies, ""Look alive""
'Cause it's hard to survive
When you're living in a concrete jungle and these girls keep passing me by
She looks fly, she looks fly
Make me say, ""my, my, my""

I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat

I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat

Hey, I wish I had my way
'Cause every day would be a Friday, and you could even speed on the highway
I would play ghetto games
Name my kids ghetto names: Little Mookie, Big Al, Lorraine
Yo, you know that's on the real
So if you're down on your luck then you should know just how I feel
'Cause if you don't want me around
See, I go simple, I go easy, I go Greyhound
Hey, you, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down
Ah, yes, ain't that fresh?
Everybody wants to get down like that

[Chorus]
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat

Our opponents upon the threat with the mighty Gigantor
I'm rippin' this shit to pieces like Skeletor
The editor, senator of all rap, competitors
Get this job done on the mic quicker than --
Financial or power, I attack with the sunshower
Get the new pres', the taste of God's power
Raining for forty days, burning for forty nights
Meteoroligists don't even pick up from the satelline
Coming a catastrophe, death of another M.C
Killed by the legendary G-O-D, as in me
Now rest in peace, six feet beneath, subconsciously
Periodically, and wake up and be somebody
I swam the shores and cause the laws and I recall
The rise and fall, but now see I walk tall
Never needed a slugger, my rapping's like the mugging
I rough up then tough up, I leave your shit left for supper
Hush up your busted, you can't be trusted
Give me a break out there, foolin' the puppet
On with the subject, cuz I'm tired of hearing this rubbish
Now get your stinking breath off the mic

Leaders get starting, AK's, ASK's

Aiyo, that's what I mean, people pray for the day
Of a good well being, man cry in your genes
If you steppin' cleans, enemies gettin' low
So he spy enemies, gather fake shit, counterfeit
Try to make a profit, still I crimes up for the rise
To the market, so many people starving, die for nothing

Your courage is flattering, but your need couldn't come close
To the Rugged M-O-N-K, vivid lyrical wordplay
Display a chamber of rhymes, you couldn't match on your best day
I leave that ass wet like a dolphin, laid in a coffin
Compton's where I come from, and shit happen's often
What you know about a nigga dying, for natural causes
He got, hit in his neck, now that's natural for flossing

Ever since back in the days, been thugging, dumping with K's
And I'm still at it, still slinging, word to them crack addicts
Still acting, still quick to keep the beef cracking

Flights to Reno, my team's 'source' like Benzino
You 'supreme', we got 'clientele', more kings in jail
We so dangerous, we don't get bail
Judge wanna, let me rot in the cell
I got to escape like Alcatraz, I be on the run like Ol' Dirty Bast'
With a suitcase full of cash, royalties ever stash
And I got dough from paid shows

You should pray that I climb the ladder, instead of waving the wand

Who couldn't be any badder, got everything that I asked for
Including the six shooter, gloves with the hat and mask
And you was giving it up so, no reason to ask
And we be living it up, future, present and past
A bit of pimp in my strut, make it like I got class
Wine in the wine glass, fine bitch with a fine ass

Or maybe three of those, how we treat them hoes

When a man wants to attract the female
The best way is to apply a musk perfume
But when a man uses a musk perfume
There are two important things he must be aware of
One; is that he will get the woman he wants
Even if she woudln't ordinarily succumb to his charms
The other is that his own special odor, his body's natural smell
Will change...

	I've been watching you, can you even raise your sword?

	Do you no longer have the stomach to fight?
	Will you remain a coward, even as your father suffers?
Oh, now, that just ain't nice
You don't have to listen to that shit
	And you have such a long long way to go
	To save your poor tortured father
	I've almost revived his rotten bones

	To suffer, and you don't even have the number two headband yet

443,Spring Affair/Winter Melody,"LILY, the caretaker's daughter, was literally run off her feet. Hardly had she brought one gentleman into the little pantry behind the office on the ground floor and helped him off with his overcoat than the wheezy hall-door bell clanged again and she had to scamper along the bare hallway to let in another guest. It was well for her she had not to attend to the ladies also. But Miss Kate and Miss Julia had thought of that and had converted the bathroom upstairs into a ladies' dressing-room. Miss Kate and Miss Julia were there, gossiping and laughing and fussing, walking after each other to the head of the stairs, peering down over the banisters and calling down to Lily to ask her who had come.

It was always a great affair, the Misses Morkan's annual dance. Everybody who knew them came to it, members of the family, old friends of the family, the members of Julia's choir, any of Kate's pupils that were grown up enough, and even some of Mary Jane's pupils too. Never once had it fallen flat. For years and years it had gone off in splendid style, as long as anyone could remember; ever since Kate and Julia, after the death of their brother Pat, had left the house in Stoney Batter and taken Mary Jane, their only niece, to live with them in the dark, gaunt house on Usher's Island, the upper part of which they had rented from Mr. Fulham, the corn-factor on the ground floor. That was a good thirty years ago if it was a day. Mary Jane, who was then a little girl in short clothes, was now the main prop of the household, for she had the organ in Haddington Road. She had been through the Academy and gave a pupils' concert every year in the upper room of the Antient Concert Rooms. Many of her pupils belonged to the better-class families on the Kingstown and Dalkey line. Old as they were, her aunts also did their share. Julia, though she was quite grey, was still the leading soprano in Adam and Eve's, and Kate, being too feeble to go about much, gave music lessons to beginners on the old square piano in the back room. Lily, the caretaker's daughter, did housemaid's work for them. Though their life was modest, they believed in eating well; the best of everything: diamond-bone sirloins, three-shilling tea and the best bottled stout. But Lily seldom made a mistake in the orders, so that she got on well with her three mistresses. They were fussy, that was all. But the only thing they would not stand was back answers.

Of course, they had good reason to be fussy on such a night. And then it was long after ten o'clock and yet there was no sign of Gabriel and his wife. Besides they were dreadfully afraid that Freddy Malins might turn up screwed. They would not wish for worlds that any of Mary Jane's pupils should see him under the influence; and when he was like that it was sometimes very hard to manage him. Freddy Malins always came late, but they wondered what could be keeping Gabriel: and that was what brought them every two minutes to the banisters to ask Lily had Gabriel or Freddy come.

""O, Mr. Conroy,"" said Lily to Gabriel when she opened the door for him, ""Miss Kate and Miss Julia thought you were never coming. Good-night, Mrs. Conroy.""

""I'll engage they did,"" said Gabriel, ""but they forget that my wife here takes three mortal hours to dress herself.""

He stood on the mat, scraping the snow from his goloshes, while Lily led his wife to the foot of the stairs and called out:

""Miss Kate, here's Mrs. Conroy.""

Kate and Julia came toddling down the dark stairs at once. Both of them kissed Gabriel's wife, said she must be perished alive, and asked was Gabriel with her.

""Here I am as right as the mail, Aunt Kate! Go on up. I'll follow,"" called out Gabriel from the dark.

He continued scraping his feet vigorously while the three women went upstairs, laughing, to the ladies' dressing-room. A light fringe of snow lay like a cape on the shoulders of his overcoat and like toecaps on the toes of his goloshes; and, as the buttons of his overcoat slipped with a squeaking noise through the snow-stiffened frieze, a cold, fragrant air from out-of-doors escaped from crevices and folds.

""Is it snowing again, Mr. Conroy?"" asked Lily.

She had preceded him into the pantry to help him off with his overcoat. Gabriel smiled at the three syllables she had given his surname and glanced at her. She was a slim, growing girl, pale in complexion and with hay-coloured hair. The gas in the pantry made her look still paler. Gabriel had known her when she was a child and used to sit on the lowest step nursing a rag doll.

""Yes, Lily,"" he answered, ""and I think we're in for a night of it.""

He looked up at the pantry ceiling, which was shaking with the stamping and shuffling of feet on the floor above, listened for a moment to the piano and then glanced at the girl, who was folding his overcoat carefully at the end of a shelf.

""Tell me, Lily,"" he said in a friendly tone, ""do you still go to school?""

""O no, sir,"" she answered. ""I'm done schooling this year and more.""

""O, then,"" said Gabriel gaily, ""I suppose we'll be going to your wedding one of these fine days with your young man, eh?""

The girl glanced back at him over her shoulder and said with great bitterness:

""The men that is now is only all palaver and what they can get out of you.""

Gabriel coloured, as if he felt he had made a mistake and, without looking at her, kicked off his goloshes and flicked actively with his muffler at his patent-leather shoes.

He was a stout, tallish young man. The high colour of his cheeks pushed upwards even to his forehead, where it scattered itself in a few formless patches of pale red; and on his hairless face there scintillated restlessly the polished lenses and the bright gilt rims of the glasses which screened his delicate and restless eyes. His glossy black hair was parted in the middle and brushed in a long curve behind his ears where it curled slightly beneath the groove left by his hat.
When he had flicked lustre into his shoes he stood up and pulled his waistcoat down more tightly on his plump body. Then he took a coin rapidly from his pocket.

""O Lily,"" he said, thrusting it into her hands, ""it's Christmastime, isn't it? Just... here's a little....""

He walked rapidly towards the door.

""O no, sir!"" cried the girl, following him. ""Really, sir, I wouldn't take it.""

""Christmas-time! Christmas-time!"" said Gabriel, almost trotting to the stairs and waving his hand to her in deprecation.

The girl, seeing that he had gained the stairs, called out after him:

""Well, thank you, sir.""

He waited outside the drawing-room door until the waltz should finish, listening to the skirts that swept against it and to the shuffling of feet. He was still discomposed by the girl's bitter and sudden retort. It had cast a gloom over him which he tried to dispel by arranging his cuffs and the bows of his tie. He then took from his waistcoat pocket a little paper and glanced at the headings he had made for his speech. He was undecided about the lines from Robert Browning, for he feared they would be above the heads of his hearers. Some quotation that they would recognise from Shakespeare or from the Melodies would be better. The indelicate clacking of the men's heels and the shuffling of their soles reminded him that their grade of culture differed from his. He would only make himself ridiculous by quoting poetry to them which they could not understand. They would think that he was airing his superior education. He would fail with them just as he had failed with the girl in the pantry. He had taken up a wrong tone. His whole speech was a mistake from first to last, an utter failure.

Just then his aunts and his wife came out of the ladies' dressing-room. His aunts were two small, plainly dressed old women. Aunt Julia was an inch or so the taller. Her hair, drawn low over the tops of her ears, was grey; and grey also, with darker shadows, was her large flaccid face. Though she was stout in build and stood erect, her slow eyes and parted lips gave her the appearance of a woman who did not know where she was or where she was going. Aunt Kate was more vivacious. Her face, healthier than her sister's, was all puckers and creases, like a shrivelled red apple, and her hair, braided in the same old-fashioned way, had not lost its ripe nut colour.
They both kissed Gabriel frankly. He was their favourite nephew the son of their dead elder sister, Ellen, who had married T. J. Conroy of the Port and Docks.

""Gretta tells me you're not going to take a cab back to Monkstown tonight, Gabriel,"" said Aunt Kate.

""No,"" said Gabriel, turning to his wife, ""we had quite enough of that last year, hadn't we? Don't you remember, Aunt Kate, what a cold Gretta got out of it? Cab windows rattling all the way, and the east wind blowing in after we passed Merrion. Very jolly it was. Gretta caught a dreadful cold.""

Aunt Kate frowned severely and nodded her head at every word.

""Quite right, Gabriel, quite right,"" she said. ""You can't be too careful.""

""But as for Gretta there,"" said Gabriel, ""she'd walk home in the snow if she were let.""

Mrs. Conroy laughed.

""Don't mind him, Aunt Kate,"" she said. ""He's really an awful bother, what with green shades for Tom's eyes at night and making him do the dumb-bells, and forcing Eva to eat the stirabout. The poor child! And she simply hates the sight of it!... O, but you'll never guess what he makes me wear now!""

She broke out into a peal of laughter and glanced at her husband, whose admiring and happy eyes had been wandering from her dress to her face and hair. The two aunts laughed heartily, too, for Gabriel's solicitude was a standing joke with them.

""Goloshes!"" said Mrs. Conroy. ""That's the latest. Whenever it's wet underfoot I must put on my galoshes. Tonight even, he wanted me to put them on, but I wouldn't. The next thing he'll buy me will be a diving suit.""

Gabriel laughed nervously and patted his tie reassuringly, while Aunt Kate nearly doubled herself, so heartily did she enjoy the joke. The smile soon faded from Aunt Julia's face and her mirthless eyes were directed towards her nephew's face. After a pause she asked:

""And what are goloshes, Gabriel?""

""Goloshes, Julia!"" exclaimed her sister ""Goodness me, don't you know what goloshes are? You wear them over your... over your boots, Gretta, isn't it?""

""Yes,"" said Mrs. Conroy. ""Guttapercha things. We both have a pair now. Gabriel says everyone wears them on the Continent.""

""O, on the Continent,"" murmured Aunt Julia, nodding her head slowly.

Gabriel knitted his brows and said, as if he were slightly angered:

""It's nothing very wonderful, but Gretta thinks it very funny because she says the word reminds her of Christy Minstrels.""

""But tell me, Gabriel,"" said Aunt Kate, with brisk tact. ""Of course, you've seen about the room. Gretta was saying...""

""0, the room is all right,"" replied Gabriel. ""I've taken one in the Gresham.""

""To be sure,"" said Aunt Kate, ""by far the best thing to do. And the children, Gretta, you're not anxious about them?""

""0, for one night,"" said Mrs. Conroy. ""Besides, Bessie will look after them.""

""To be sure,"" said Aunt Kate again. ""What a comfort it is to have a girl like that, one you can depend on! There's that Lily, I'm sure I don't know what has come over her lately. She's not the girl she was at all.""

Gabriel was about to ask his aunt some questions on this point, but she broke off suddenly to gaze after her sister, who had wandered down the stairs and was craning her neck over the banisters.

""Now, I ask you,"" she said almost testily, ""where is Julia going? Julia! Julia! Where are you going?""

Julia, who had gone half way down one flight, came back and announced blandly:

""Here's Freddy.""

At the same moment a clapping of hands and a final flourish of the pianist told that the waltz had ended. The drawing-room door was opened from within and some couples came out. Aunt Kate drew Gabriel aside hurriedly and whispered into his ear:

""Slip down, Gabriel, like a good fellow and see if he's all right, and don't let him up if he's screwed. I'm sure he's screwed. I'm sure he is.""

Gabriel went to the stairs and listened over the banisters. He could hear two persons talking in the pantry. Then he recognised Freddy Malins' laugh. He went down the stairs noisily.

""It's such a relief,"" said Aunt Kate to Mrs. Conroy, ""that Gabriel is here. I always feel easier in my mind when he's here.... Julia, there's Miss Daly and Miss Power will take some refreshment. Thanks for your beautiful waltz, Miss Daly. It made lovely time.""

A tall wizen-faced man, with a stiff grizzled moustache and swarthy skin, who was passing out with his partner, said:

""And may we have some refreshment, too, Miss Morkan?""

""Julia,"" said Aunt Kate summarily, ""and here's Mr. Browne and Miss Furlong. Take them in, Julia, with Miss Daly and Miss Power.""

""I'm the man for the ladies,"" said Mr. Browne, pursing his lips until his moustache bristled and smiling in all his wrinkles. ""You know, Miss Morkan, the reason they are so fond of me is----""

He did not finish his sentence, but, seeing that Aunt Kate was out of earshot, at once led the three young ladies into the back room. The middle of the room was occupied by two square tables placed end to end, and on these Aunt Julia and the caretaker were straightening and smoothing a large cloth. On the sideboard were arrayed dishes and plates, and glasses and bundles of knives and forks and spoons. The top of the closed square piano served also as a sideboard for viands and sweets. At a smaller sideboard in one corner two young men were standing, drinking hop-bitters.

Mr. Browne led his charges thither and invited them all, in jest, to some ladies' punch, hot, strong and sweet. As they said they never took anything strong, he opened three bottles of lemonade for them. Then he asked one of the young men to move aside, and, taking hold of the decanter, filled out for himself a goodly measure of whisky. The young men eyed him respectfully while he took a trial sip.

""God help me,"" he said, smiling, ""it's the doctor's orders.""

His wizened face broke into a broader smile, and the three young ladies laughed in musical echo to his pleasantry, swaying their bodies to and fro, with nervous jerks of their shoulders. The boldest said:

""O, now, Mr. Browne, I'm sure the doctor never ordered anything of the kind.""

Mr. Browne took another sip of his whisky and said, with sidling mimicry:

""Well, you see, I'm like the famous Mrs. Cassidy, who is reported to have said: 'Now, Mary Grimes, if I don't take it, make me take it, for I feel I want it.'""

His hot face had leaned forward a little too confidentially and he had assumed a very low Dublin accent so that the young ladies, with one instinct, received his speech in silence. Miss Furlong, who was one of Mary Jane's pupils, asked Miss Daly what was the name of the pretty waltz she had played; and Mr. Browne, seeing that he was ignored, turned promptly to the two young men who were more appreciative.

A red-faced young woman, dressed in pansy, came into the room, excitedly clapping her hands and crying:

""Quadrilles! Quadrilles!""

Close on her heels came Aunt Kate, crying:

""Two gentlemen and three ladies, Mary Jane!""

""O, here's Mr. Bergin and Mr. Kerrigan,"" said Mary Jane. ""Mr. Kerrigan, will you take Miss Power? Miss Furlong, may I get you a partner, Mr. Bergin. O, that'll just do now.""

""Three ladies, Mary Jane,"" said Aunt Kate.

The two young gentlemen asked the ladies if they might have the pleasure, and Mary Jane turned to Miss Daly.

""O, Miss Daly, you're really awfully good, after playing for the last two dances, but really we're so short of ladies tonight.""

""I don't mind in the least, Miss Morkan.""

""But I've a nice partner for you, Mr. Bartell D'Arcy, the tenor. I'll get him to sing later on. All Dublin is raving about him.""

""Lovely voice, lovely voice!"" said Aunt Kate.

As the piano had twice begun the prelude to the first figure Mary Jane led her recruits quickly from the room. They had hardly gone when Aunt Julia wandered slowly into the room, looking behind her at something.

""What is the matter, Julia?"" asked Aunt Kate anxiously. ""Who is it?""

Julia, who was carrying in a column of table-napkins, turned to her sister and said, simply, as if the question had surprised her:

""It's only Freddy, Kate, and Gabriel with him.""

In fact right behind her Gabriel could be seen piloting Freddy Malins across the landing. The latter, a young man of about forty, was of Gabriel's size and build, with very round shoulders. His face was fleshy and pallid, touched with colour only at the thick hanging lobes of his ears and at the wide wings of his nose. He had coarse features, a blunt nose, a convex and receding brow, tumid and protruded lips. His heavy-lidded eyes and the disorder of his scanty hair made him look sleepy. He was laughing heartily in a high key at a story which he had been telling Gabriel on the stairs and at the same time rubbing the knuckles of his left fist backwards and forwards into his left eye.

""Good-evening, Freddy,"" said Aunt Julia.

Freddy Malins bade the Misses Morkan good-evening in what seemed an offhand fashion by reason of the habitual catch in his voice and then, seeing that Mr. Browne was grinning at him from the sideboard, crossed the room on rather shaky legs and began to repeat in an undertone the story he had just told to Gabriel.

""He's not so bad, is he?"" said Aunt Kate to Gabriel.

Gabriel's brows were dark but he raised them quickly and answered:

""O, no, hardly noticeable.""

""Now, isn't he a terrible fellow!"" she said. ""And his poor mother made him take the pledge on New Year's Eve. But come on, Gabriel, into the drawing-room.""

Before leaving the room with Gabriel she signalled to Mr. Browne by frowning and shaking her forefinger in warning to and fro. Mr. Browne nodded in answer and, when she had gone, said to Freddy Malins:

""Now, then, Teddy, I'm going to fill you out a good glass of lemonade just to buck you up.""

Freddy Malins, who was nearing the climax of his story, waved the offer aside impatiently but Mr. Browne, having first called Freddy Malins' attention to a disarray in his dress, filled out and handed him a full glass of lemonade. Freddy Malins' left hand accepted the glass mechanically, his right hand being engaged in the mechanical readjustment of his dress. Mr. Browne, whose face was once more wrinkling with mirth, poured out for himself a glass of whisky while Freddy Malins exploded, before he had well reached the climax of his story, in a kink of high-pitched bronchitic laughter and, setting down his untasted and overflowing glass, began to rub the knuckles of his left fist backwards and forwards into his left eye, repeating words of his last phrase as well as his fit of laughter would allow him.

Gabriel could not listen while Mary Jane was playing her Academy piece, full of runs and difficult passages, to the hushed drawing-room. He liked music but the piece she was playing had no melody for him and he doubted whether it had any melody for the other listeners, though they had begged Mary Jane to play something. Four young men, who had come from the refreshment-room to stand in the doorway at the sound of the piano, had gone away quietly in couples after a few minutes. The only persons who seemed to follow the music were Mary Jane herself, her hands racing along the key-board or lifted from it at the pauses like those of a priestess in momentary imprecation, and Aunt Kate standing at her elbow to turn the page.

Gabriel's eyes, irritated by the floor, which glittered with beeswax under the heavy chandelier, wandered to the wall above the piano. A picture of the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet hung there and beside it was a picture of the two murdered princes in the Tower which Aunt Julia had worked in red, blue and brown wools when she was a girl. Probably in the school they had gone to as girls that kind of work had been taught for one year. His mother had worked for him as a birthday present a waistcoat of purple tabinet, with little foxes' heads upon it, lined with brown satin and having round mulberry buttons. It was strange that his mother had had no musical talent though Aunt Kate used to call her the brains carrier of the Morkan family. Both she and Julia had always seemed a little proud of their serious and matronly sister. Her photograph stood before the pierglass. She held an open book on her knees and was pointing out something in it to Constantine who, dressed in a man-o-war suit, lay at her feet. It was she who had chosen the name of her sons for she was very sensible of the dignity of family life. Thanks to her, Constantine was now senior curate in Balbrigan and, thanks to her, Gabriel himself had taken his degree in the Royal University. A shadow passed over his face as he remembered her sullen opposition to his marriage. Some slighting phrases she had used still rankled in his memory; she had once spoken of Gretta as being country cute and that was not true of Gretta at all. It was Gretta who had nursed her during all her last long illness in their house at Monkstown.

He knew that Mary Jane must be near the end of her piece for she was playing again the opening melody with runs of scales after every bar and while he waited for the end the resentment died down in his heart. The piece ended with a trill of octaves in the treble and a final deep octave in the bass. Great applause greeted Mary Jane as, blushing and rolling up her music nervously, she escaped from the room. The most vigorous clapping came from the four young men in the doorway who had gone away to the refreshment-room at the beginning of the piece but had come back when the piano had stopped.

Lancers were arranged. Gabriel found himself partnered with Miss Ivors. She was a frank-mannered talkative young lady, with a freckled face and prominent brown eyes. She did not wear a low-cut bodice and the large brooch which was fixed in the front of her collar bore on it an Irish device and motto.

When they had taken their places she said abruptly:

""I have a crow to pluck with you.""

""With me?"" said Gabriel.

She nodded her head gravely.

""What is it?"" asked Gabriel, smiling at her solemn manner.

""Who is G. C.?"" answered Miss Ivors, turning her eyes upon him.

Gabriel coloured and was about to knit his brows, as if he did not understand, when she said bluntly:

""O, innocent Amy! I have found out that you write for The Daily Express. Now, aren't you ashamed of yourself?""

""Why should I be ashamed of myself?"" asked Gabriel, blinking his eyes and trying to smile.

""Well, I'm ashamed of you,"" said Miss Ivors frankly. ""To say you'd write for a paper like that. I didn't think you were a West Briton.""

A look of perplexity appeared on Gabriel's face. It was true that he wrote a literary column every Wednesday in The Daily Express, for which he was paid fifteen shillings. But that did not make him a West Briton surely. The books he received for review were almost more welcome than the paltry cheque. He loved to feel the covers and turn over the pages of newly printed books. Nearly every day when his teaching in the college was ended he used to wander down the quays to the second-hand booksellers, to Hickey's on Bachelor's Walk, to Web's or Massey's on Aston's Quay, or to O'Clohissey's in the bystreet. He did not know how to meet her charge. He wanted to say that literature was above politics. But they were friends of many years' standing and their careers had been parallel, first at the University and then as teachers: he could not risk a grandiose phrase with her. He continued blinking his eyes and trying to smile and murmured lamely that he saw nothing political in writing reviews of books.

When their turn to cross had come he was still perplexed and inattentive. Miss Ivors promptly took his hand in a warm grasp and said in a soft friendly tone:

""Of course, I was only joking. Come, we cross now.""

When they were together again she spoke of the University question and Gabriel felt more at ease. A friend of hers had shown her his review of Browning's poems. That was how she had found out the secret: but she liked the review immensely. Then she said suddenly:

""O, Mr. Conroy, will you come for an excursion to the Aran Isles this summer? We're going to stay there a whole month. It will be splendid out in the Atlantic. You ought to come. Mr. Clancy is coming, and Mr. Kilkelly and Kathleen Kearney. It would be splendid for Gretta too if she'd come. She's from Connacht, isn't she?""

""Her people are,"" said Gabriel shortly.

""But you will come, won't you?"" said Miss Ivors, laying her arm hand eagerly on his arm.

""The fact is,"" said Gabriel, ""I have just arranged to go----""

""Go where?"" asked Miss Ivors.

""Well, you know, every year I go for a cycling tour with some fellows and so----""

""But where?"" asked Miss Ivors.

""Well, we usually go to France or Belgium or perhaps Germany,"" said Gabriel awkwardly.

""And why do you go to France and Belgium,"" said Miss Ivors, ""instead of visiting your own land?""

""Well,"" said Gabriel, ""it's partly to keep in touch with the languages and partly for a change.""

""And haven't you your own language to keep in touch with -- Irish?"" asked Miss Ivors.

""Well,"" said Gabriel, ""if it comes to that, you know, Irish is not my language.""

Their neighbours had turned to listen to the cross-examination. Gabriel glanced right and left nervously and tried to keep his good humour under the ordeal which was making a blush invade his forehead.

""And haven't you your own land to visit,"" continued Miss Ivors, ""that you know nothing of, your own people, and your own country?""

""0, to tell you the truth,"" retorted Gabriel suddenly, ""I'm sick of my own country, sick of it!""

""Why?"" asked Miss Ivors.

Gabriel did not answer for his retort had heated him.

""Why?"" repeated Miss Ivors.

They had to go visiting together and, as he had not answered her, Miss Ivors said warmly:

""Of course, you've no answer.""

Gabriel tried to cover his agitation by taking part in the dance with great energy. He avoided her eyes for he had seen a sour expression on her face. But when they met in the long chain he was surprised to feel his hand firmly pressed. She looked at him from under her brows for a moment quizzically until he smiled. Then, just as the chain was about to start again, she stood on tiptoe and whispered into his ear:

""West Briton!""

When the lancers were over Gabriel went away to a remote corner of the room where Freddy Malins' mother was sitting. She was a stout feeble old woman with white hair. Her voice had a catch in it like her son's and she stuttered slightly. She had been told that Freddy had come and that he was nearly all right. Gabriel asked her whether she had had a good crossing. She lived with her married daughter in Glasgow and came to Dublin on a visit once a year. She answered placidly that she had had a beautiful crossing and that the captain had been most attentive to her. She spoke also of the beautiful house her daughter kept in Glasgow, and of all the friends they had there. While her tongue rambled on Gabriel tried to banish from his mind all memory of the unpleasant incident with Miss Ivors. Of course the girl or woman, or whatever she was, was an enthusiast but there was a time for all things. Perhaps he ought not to have answered her like that. But she had no right to call him a West Briton before people, even in joke. She had tried to make him ridiculous before people, heckling him and staring at him with her rabbit's eyes.

He saw his wife making her way towards him through the waltzing couples. When she reached him she said into his ear:

""Gabriel. Aunt Kate wants to know won't you carve the goose as usual. Miss Daly will carve the ham and I'll do the pudding.""

""All right,"" said Gabriel.

""She's sending in the younger ones first as soon as this waltz is over so that we'll have the table to ourselves.""

""Were you dancing?"" asked Gabriel.

""Of course I was. Didn't you see me? What row had you with Molly Ivors?""

""No row. Why? Did she say so?""

""Something like that. I'm trying to get that Mr. D'Arcy to sing. He's full of conceit, I think.""

""There was no row,"" said Gabriel moodily, ""only she wanted me to go for a trip to the west of Ireland and I said I wouldn't.""

His wife clasped her hands excitedly and gave a little jump.

""O, do go, Gabriel,"" she cried. ""I'd love to see Galway again.""

""You can go if you like,"" said Gabriel coldly.

She looked at him for a moment, then turned to Mrs. Malins and said:

""There's a nice husband for you, Mrs. Malins.""

While she was threading her way back across the room Mrs. Malins, without adverting to the interruption, went on to tell Gabriel what beautiful places there were in Scotland and beautiful scenery. Her son-in-law brought them every year to the lakes and they used to go fishing. Her son-in-law was a splendid fisher. One day he caught a beautiful big fish and the man in the hotel cooked it for their dinner.

Gabriel hardly heard what she said. Now that supper was coming near he began to think again about his speech and about the quotation. When he saw Freddy Malins coming across the room to visit his mother Gabriel left the chair free for him and retired into the embrasure of the window. The room had already cleared and from the back room came the clatter of plates and knives. Those who still remained in the drawing room seemed tired of dancing and were conversing quietly in little groups. Gabriel's warm trembling fingers tapped the cold pane of the window. How cool it must be outside! How pleasant it would be to walk out alone, first along by the river and then through the park! The snow would be lying on the branches of the trees and forming a bright cap on the top of the Wellington Monument. How much more pleasant it would be there than at the supper-table!

He ran over the headings of his speech: Irish hospitality, sad memories, the Three Graces, Paris, the quotation from Browning. He repeated to himself a phrase he had written in his review: ""One feels that one is listening to a thought- tormented music."" Miss Ivors had praised the review. Was she sincere? Had she really any life of her own behind all her propagandism? There had never been any ill-feeling between them until that night. It unnerved him to think that she would be at the supper-table, looking up at him while he spoke with her critical quizzing eyes. Perhaps she would not be sorry to see him fail in his speech. An idea came into his mind and gave him courage. He would say, alluding to Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia: ""Ladies and Gentlemen, the generation which is now on the wane among us may have had its faults but for my part I think it had certain qualities of hospitality, of humour, of humanity, which the new and very serious and hypereducated generation that is growing up around us seems to me to lack."" Very good: that was one for Miss Ivors. What did he care that his aunts were only two ignorant old women?

A murmur in the room attracted his attention. Mr. Browne was advancing from the door, gallantly escorting Aunt Julia, who leaned upon his arm, smiling and hanging her head. An irregular musketry of applause escorted her also as far as the piano and then, as Mary Jane seated herself on the stool, and Aunt Julia, no longer smiling, half turned so as to pitch her voice fairly into the room, gradually ceased. Gabriel recognised the prelude. It was that of an old song of Aunt Julia's -- Arrayed for the Bridal. Her voice, strong and clear in tone, attacked with great spirit the runs which embellish the air and though she sang very rapidly she did not miss even the smallest of the grace notes. To follow the voice, without looking at the singer's face, was to feel and share the excitement of swift and secure flight. Gabriel applauded loudly with all the others at the close of the song and loud applause was borne in from the invisible supper-table. It sounded so genuine that a little colour struggled into Aunt Julia's face as she bent to replace in the music-stand the old leather-bound songbook that had her initials on the cover. Freddy Malins, who had listened with his head perched sideways to hear her better, was still applauding when everyone else had ceased and talking animatedly to his mother who nodded her head gravely and slowly in acquiescence. At last, when he could clap no more, he stood up suddenly and hurried across the room to Aunt Julia whose hand he seized and held in both his hands, shaking it when words failed him or the catch in his voice proved too much for him.

""I was just telling my mother,"" he said, ""I never heard you sing so well, never. No, I never heard your voice so good as it is tonight. Now! Would you believe that now? That's the truth. Upon my word and honour that's the truth. I never heard your voice sound so fresh and so... so clear and fresh, never.""

Aunt Julia smiled broadly and murmured something about compliments as she released her hand from his grasp. Mr. Browne extended his open hand towards her and said to those who were near him in the manner of a showman introducing a prodigy to an audience:

""Miss Julia Morkan, my latest discovery!""

He was laughing very heartily at this himself when Freddy Malins turned to him and said:

""Well, Browne, if you're serious you might make a worse discovery. All I can say is I never heard her sing half so well as long as I am coming here. And that's the honest truth.""

""Neither did I,"" said Mr. Browne. ""I think her voice has greatly improved.""

Aunt Julia shrugged her shoulders and said with meek pride:

""Thirty years ago I hadn't a bad voice as voices go.""

""I often told Julia,"" said Aunt Kate emphatically, ""that she was simply thrown away in that choir. But she never would be said by me.""

She turned as if to appeal to the good sense of the others against a refractory child while Aunt Julia gazed in front of her, a vague smile of reminiscence playing on her face.

""No,"" continued Aunt Kate, ""she wouldn't be said or led by anyone, slaving there in that choir night and day, night and day. Six o'clock on Christmas morning! And all for what?""

""Well, isn't it for the honour of God, Aunt Kate?"" asked Mary Jane, twisting round on the piano-stool and smiling.

Aunt Kate turned fiercely on her niece and said:

""I know all about the honour of God, Mary Jane, but I think it's not at all honourable for the pope to turn out the women out of the choirs that have slaved there all their lives and put little whipper-snappers of boys over their heads. I suppose it is for the good of the Church if the pope does it. But it's not just, Mary Jane, and it's not right.""

She had worked herself into a passion and would have continued in defence of her sister for it was a sore subject with her but Mary Jane, seeing that all the dancers had come back, intervened pacifically:

""Now, Aunt Kate, you're giving scandal to Mr. Browne who is of the other persuasion.""

Aunt Kate turned to Mr. Browne, who was grinning at this allusion to his religion, and said hastily:

""O, I don't question the pope's being right. I'm only a stupid old woman and I wouldn't presume to do such a thing. But there's such a thing as common everyday politeness and gratitude. And if I were in Julia's place I'd tell that Father Healey straight up to his face...""

""And besides, Aunt Kate,"" said Mary Jane, ""we really are all hungry and when we are hungry we are all very quarrelsome.""

""And when we are thirsty we are also quarrelsome,"" added Mr. Browne.

""So that we had better go to supper,"" said Mary Jane, ""and finish the discussion afterwards.""

On the landing outside the drawing-room Gabriel found his wife and Mary Jane trying to persuade Miss Ivors to stay for supper. But Miss Ivors, who had put on her hat and was buttoning her cloak, would not stay. She did not feel in the least hungry and she had already overstayed her time.

""But only for ten minutes, Molly,"" said Mrs. Conroy. ""That won't delay you.""

""To take a pick itself,"" said Mary Jane, ""after all your dancing.""

""I really couldn't,"" said Miss Ivors.

""I am afraid you didn't enjoy yourself at all,"" said Mary Jane hopelessly.

""Ever so much, I assure you,"" said Miss Ivors, ""but you really must let me run off now.""

""But how can you get home?"" asked Mrs. Conroy.

""O, it's only two steps up the quay.""

Gabriel hesitated a moment and said:

""If you will allow me, Miss Ivors, I'll see you home if you are really obliged to go.""

But Miss Ivors broke away from them.

""I won't hear of it,"" she cried. ""For goodness' sake go in to your suppers and don't mind me. I'm quite well able to take care of myself.""

""Well, you're the comical girl, Molly,"" said Mrs. Conroy frankly.

""Beannacht libh,"" cried Miss Ivors, with a laugh, as she ran down the staircase.

Mary Jane gazed after her, a moody puzzled expression on her face, while Mrs. Conroy leaned over the banisters to listen for the hall-door. Gabriel asked himself was he the cause of her abrupt departure. But she did not seem to be in ill humour: she had gone away laughing. He stared blankly down the staircase.

At the moment Aunt Kate came toddling out of the supper-room, almost wringing her hands in despair.

""Where is Gabriel?"" she cried. ""Where on earth is Gabriel? There's everyone waiting in there, stage to let, and nobody to carve the goose!""

""Here I am, Aunt Kate!"" cried Gabriel, with sudden animation, ""ready to carve a flock of geese, if necessary.""

A fat brown goose lay at one end of the table and at the other end, on a bed of creased paper strewn with sprigs of parsley, lay a great ham, stripped of its outer skin and peppered over with crust crumbs, a neat paper frill round its shin and beside this was a round of spiced beef. Between these rival ends ran parallel lines of side-dishes: two little minsters of jelly, red and yellow; a shallow dish full of blocks of blancmange and red jam, a large green leaf-shaped dish with a stalk-shaped handle, on which lay bunches of purple raisins and peeled almonds, a companion dish on which lay a solid rectangle of Smyrna figs, a dish of custard topped with grated nutmeg, a small bowl full of chocolates and sweets wrapped in gold and silver papers and a glass vase in which stood some tall celery stalks. In the centre of the table there stood, as sentries to a fruit-stand which upheld a pyramid of oranges and American apples, two squat old-fashioned decanters of cut glass, one containing port and the other dark sherry. On the closed square piano a pudding in a huge yellow dish lay in waiting and behind it were three squads of bottles of stout and ale and minerals, drawn up according to the colours of their uniforms, the first two black, with brown and red labels, the third and smallest squad white, with transverse green sashes.

Gabriel took his seat boldly at the head of the table and, having looked to the edge of the carver, plunged his fork firmly into the goose. He felt quite at ease now for he was an expert carver and liked nothing better than to find himself at the head of a well-laden table.

""Miss Furlong, what shall I send you?"" he asked. ""A wing or a slice of the breast?""

""Just a small slice of the breast.""

""Miss Higgins, what for you?""

""O, anything at all, Mr. Conroy.""

While Gabriel and Miss Daly exchanged plates of goose and plates of ham and spiced beef Lily went from guest to guest with a dish of hot floury potatoes wrapped in a white napkin. This was Mary Jane's idea and she had also suggested apple sauce for the goose but Aunt Kate had said that plain roast goose without any apple sauce had always been good enough for her and she hoped she might never eat worse. Mary Jane waited on her pupils and saw that they got the best slices and Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia opened and carried across from the piano bottles of stout and ale for the gentlemen and bottles of minerals for the ladies. There was a great deal of confusion and laughter and noise, the noise of orders and counter-orders, of knives and forks, of corks and glass-stoppers. Gabriel began to carve second helpings as soon as he had finished the first round without serving himself. Everyone protested loudly so that he compromised by taking a long draught of stout for he had found the carving hot work. Mary Jane settled down quietly to her supper but Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia were still toddling round the table, walking on each other's heels, getting in each other's way and giving each other unheeded orders. Mr. Browne begged of them to sit down and eat their suppers and so did Gabriel but they said there was time enough, so that, at last, Freddy Malins stood up and, capturing Aunt Kate, plumped her down on her chair amid general laughter.

When everyone had been well served Gabriel said, smiling:

""Now, if anyone wants a little more of what vulgar people call stuffing let him or her speak.""

A chorus of voices invited him to begin his own supper and Lily came forward with three potatoes which she had reserved for him.

""Very well,"" said Gabriel amiably, as he took another preparatory draught, ""kindly forget my existence, ladies and gentlemen, for a few minutes.""

He set to his supper and took no part in the conversation with which the table covered Lily's removal of the plates. The subject of talk was the opera company which was then at the Theatre Royal. Mr. Bartell D'Arcy, the tenor, a dark- complexioned young man with a smart moustache, praised very highly the leading contralto of the company but Miss Furlong thought she had a rather vulgar style of production. Freddy Malins said there was a Negro chieftain singing in the second part of the Gaiety pantomime who had one of the finest tenor voices he had ever heard.

""Have you heard him?"" he asked Mr. Bartell D'Arcy across the table.

""No,"" answered Mr. Bartell D'Arcy carelessly.

""Because,"" Freddy Malins explained, ""now I'd be curious to hear your opinion of him. I think he has a grand voice.""

""It takes Teddy to find out the really good things,"" said Mr. Browne familiarly to the table.

""And why couldn't he have a voice too?"" asked Freddy Malins sharply. ""Is it because he's only a black?""

Nobody answered this question and Mary Jane led the table back to the legitimate opera. One of her pupils had given her a pass for Mignon. Of course it was very fine, she said, but it made her think of poor Georgina Burns. Mr. Browne could go back farther still, to the old Italian companies that used to come to Dublin -- Tietjens, Ilma de Murzka, Campanini, the great Trebelli, Giuglini, Ravelli, Aramburo. Those were the days, he said, when there was something like singing to be heard in Dublin. He told too of how the top gallery of the old Royal used to be packed night after night, of how one night an Italian tenor had sung five encores to Let me like a Soldier fall, introducing a high C every time, and of how the gallery boys would sometimes in their enthusiasm unyoke the horses from the carriage of some great prima donna and pull her themselves through the streets to her hotel. Why did they never play the grand old operas now, he asked, Dinorah, Lucrezia Borgia? Because they could not get the voices to sing them: that was why.

""Oh, well,"" said Mr. Bartell D'Arcy, ""I presume there are as good singers today as there were then.""

""Where are they?"" asked Mr. Browne defiantly.

""In London, Paris, Milan,"" said Mr. Bartell D'Arcy warmly. ""I suppose Caruso, for example, is quite as good, if not better than any of the men you have mentioned.""

""Maybe so,"" said Mr. Browne. ""But I may tell you I doubt it strongly.""

""O, I'd give anything to hear Caruso sing,"" said Mary Jane.

""For me,"" said Aunt Kate, who had been picking a bone, ""there was only one tenor. To please me, I mean. But I suppose none of you ever heard of him.""

""Who was he, Miss Morkan?"" asked Mr. Bartell D'Arcy politely.

""His name,"" said Aunt Kate, ""was Parkinson. I heard him when he was in his prime and I think he had then the purest tenor voice that was ever put into a man's throat.""

""Strange,"" said Mr. Bartell D'Arcy. ""I never even heard of him.""

""Yes, yes, Miss Morkan is right,"" said Mr. Browne. ""I remember hearing of old Parkinson but he's too far back for me.""

""A beautiful, pure, sweet, mellow English tenor,"" said Aunt Kate with enthusiasm.

Gabriel having finished, the huge pudding was transferred to the table. The clatter of forks and spoons began again. Gabriel's wife served out spoonfuls of the pudding and passed the plates down the table. Midway down they were held up by Mary Jane, who replenished them with raspberry or orange jelly or with blancmange and jam. The pudding was of Aunt Julia's making and she received praises for it from all quarters She herself said that it was not quite brown enough.

""Well, I hope, Miss Morkan,"" said Mr. Browne, ""that I'm brown enough for you because, you know, I'm all brown.""

All the gentlemen, except Gabriel, ate some of the pudding out of compliment to Aunt Julia. As Gabriel never ate sweets the celery had been left for him. Freddy Malins also took a stalk of celery and ate it with his pudding. He had been told that celery was a capital thing for the blood and he was just then under doctor's care. Mrs. Malins, who had been silent all through the supper, said that her son was going down to Mount Melleray in a week or so. The table then spoke of Mount Melleray, how bracing the air was down there, how hospitable the monks were and how they never asked for a penny-piece from their guests.

""And do you mean to say,"" asked Mr. Browne incredulously, ""that a chap can go down there and put up there as if it were a hotel and live on the fat of the land and then come away without paying anything?""

""O, most people give some donation to the monastery when they leave."" said Mary Jane.

""I wish we had an institution like that in our Church,"" said Mr. Browne candidly.

He was astonished to hear that the monks never spoke, got up at two in the morning and slept in their coffins. He asked what they did it for.

""That's the rule of the order,"" said Aunt Kate firmly.

""Yes, but why?"" asked Mr. Browne.

Aunt Kate repeated that it was the rule, that was all. Mr. Browne still seemed not to understand. Freddy Malins explained to him, as best he could, that the monks were trying to make up for the sins committed by all the sinners in the outside world. The explanation was not very clear for Mr. Browne grinned and said:

""I like that idea very much but wouldn't a comfortable spring bed do them as well as a coffin?""

""The coffin,"" said Mary Jane, ""is to remind them of their last end.""

As the subject had grown lugubrious it was buried in a silence of the table during which Mrs. Malins could be heard saying to her neighbour in an indistinct undertone:

""They are very good men, the monks, very pious men.""

The raisins and almonds and figs and apples and oranges and chocolates and sweets were now passed about the table and Aunt Julia invited all the guests to have either port or sherry. At first Mr. Bartell D'Arcy refused to take either but one of his neighbours nudged him and whispered something to him upon which he allowed his glass to be filled. Gradually as the last glasses were being filled the conversation ceased. A pause followed, broken only by the noise of the wine and by unsettlings of chairs. The Misses Morkan, all three, looked down at the tablecloth. Someone coughed once or twice and then a few gentlemen patted the table gently as a signal for silence. The silence came and Gabriel pushed back his chair.

The patting at once grew louder in encouragement and then ceased altogether. Gabriel leaned his ten trembling fingers on the tablecloth and smiled nervously at the company. Meeting a row of upturned faces he raised his eyes to the chandelier. The piano was playing a waltz tune and he could hear the skirts sweeping against the drawing-room door. People, perhaps, were standing in the snow on the quay outside, gazing up at the lighted windows and listening to the waltz music. The air was pure there. In the distance lay the park where the trees were weighted with snow. The Wellington Monument wore a gleaming cap of snow that flashed westward over the white field of Fifteen Acres.

He began:

""Ladies and Gentlemen.

""It has fallen to my lot this evening, as in years past, to perform a very pleasing task but a task for which I am afraid my poor powers as a speaker are all too inadequate.""

""No, no!"" said Mr. Browne.

""But, however that may be, I can only ask you tonight to take the will for the deed and to lend me your attention for a few moments while I endeavour to express to you in words what my feelings are on this occasion.

""Ladies and Gentlemen, it is not the first time that we have gathered together under this hospitable roof, around this hospitable board. It is not the first time that we have been the recipients -- or perhaps, I had better say, the victims -- of the hospitality of certain good ladies.""

He made a circle in the air with his arm and paused. Everyone laughed or smiled at Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia and Mary Jane who all turned crimson with pleasure. Gabriel went on more boldly:

""I feel more strongly with every recurring year that our country has no tradition which does it so much honour and which it should guard so jealously as that of its hospitality. It is a tradition that is unique as far as my experience goes (and I have visited not a few places abroad) among the modern nations. Some would say, perhaps, that with us it is rather a failing than anything to be boasted of. But granted even that, it is, to my mind, a princely failing, and one that I trust will long be cultivated among us. Of one thing, at least, I am sure. As long as this one roof shelters the good ladies aforesaid -- and I wish from my heart it may do so for many and many a long year to come -- the tradition of genuine warm-hearted courteous Irish hospitality, which our forefathers have handed down to us and which we in turn must hand down to our descendants, is still alive among us.""

A hearty murmur of assent ran round the table. It shot through Gabriel's mind that Miss Ivors was not there and that she had gone away discourteously: and he said with confidence in himself:

""Ladies and Gentlemen.

""A new generation is growing up in our midst, a generation actuated by new ideas and new principles. It is serious and enthusiastic for these new ideas and its enthusiasm, even when it is misdirected, is, I believe, in the main sincere. But we are living in a sceptical and, if I may use the phrase, a thought-tormented age: and sometimes I fear that this new generation, educated or hypereducated as it is, will lack those qualities of humanity, of hospitality, of kindly humour which belonged to an older day. Listening tonight to the names of all those great singers of the past it seemed to me, I must confess, that we were living in a less spacious age. Those days might, without exaggeration, be called spacious days: and if they are gone beyond recall let us hope, at least, that in gatherings such as this we shall still speak of them with pride and affection, still cherish in our hearts the memory of those dead and gone great ones whose fame the world will not willingly let die.""

""Hear, hear!"" said Mr. Browne loudly.

""But yet,"" continued Gabriel, his voice falling into a softer inflection, ""there are always in gatherings such as this sadder thoughts that will recur to our minds: thoughts of the past, of youth, of changes, of absent faces that we miss here tonight. Our path through life is strewn with many such sad memories: and were we to brood upon them always we could not find the heart to go on bravely with our work among the living. We have all of us living duties and living affections which claim, and rightly claim, our strenuous endeavours.

""Therefore, I will not linger on the past. I will not let any gloomy moralising intrude upon us here tonight. Here we are gathered together for a brief moment from the bustle and rush of our everyday routine. We are met here as friends, in the spirit of good-fellowship, as colleagues, also to a certain extent, in the true spirit of camaraderie, and as the guests of -- what shall I call them? -- the Three Graces of the Dublin musical world.""

The table burst into applause and laughter at this allusion. Aunt Julia vainly asked each of her neighbours in turn to tell her what Gabriel had said.

""He says we are the Three Graces, Aunt Julia,"" said Mary Jane.

Aunt Julia did not understand but she looked up, smiling, at Gabriel, who continued in the same vein:

""Ladies and Gentlemen.

""I will not attempt to play tonight the part that Paris played on another occasion. I will not attempt to choose between them. The task would be an invidious one and one beyond my poor powers. For when I view them in turn, whether it be our chief hostess herself, whose good heart, whose too good heart, has become a byword with all who know her, or her sister, who seems to be gifted with perennial youth and whose singing must have been a surprise and a revelation to us all tonight, or, last but not least, when I consider our youngest hostess, talented, cheerful, hard-working and the best of nieces, I confess, Ladies and Gentlemen, that I do not know to which of them I should award the prize.""

Gabriel glanced down at his aunts and, seeing the large smile on Aunt Julia's face and the tears which had risen to Aunt Kate's eyes, hastened to his close. He raised his glass of port gallantly, while every member of the company fingered a glass expectantly, and said loudly:

""Let us toast them all three together. Let us drink to their health, wealth, long life, happiness and prosperity and may they long continue to hold the proud and self-won position which they hold in their profession and the position of honour and affection which they hold in our hearts.""

All the guests stood up, glass in hand, and turning towards the three seated ladies, sang in unison, with Mr. Browne as leader:

For they are jolly gay fellows
For they are jolly gay fellows
For they are jolly gay fellows
Which nobody can deny.

Aunt Kate was making frank use of her handkerchief and even Aunt Julia seemed moved. Freddy Malins beat time with his pudding-fork and the singers turned towards one another, as if in melodious conference, while they sang with emphasis:

Unless he tells a lie
Unless he tells a lie.

Then, turning once more towards their hostesses, they sang:

For they are jolly gay fellows
For they are jolly gay fellows
For they are jolly gay fellows
Which nobody can deny.

The acclamation which followed was taken up beyond the door of the supper-room by many of the other guests and renewed time after time, Freddy Malins acting as officer with his fork on high.

The piercing morning air came into the hall where they were standing so that Aunt Kate said:

""Close the door, somebody. Mrs. Malins will get her death of cold.""

""Browne is out there, Aunt Kate,"" said Mary Jane.

""Browne is everywhere,"" said Aunt Kate, lowering her voice.

Mary Jane laughed at her tone.

""Really,"" she said archly, ""he is very attentive.""

""He has been laid on here like the gas,"" said Aunt Kate in the same tone, ""all during the Christmas.""

She laughed herself this time good-humouredly and then added quickly:

""But tell him to come in, Mary Jane, and close the door. I hope to goodness he didn't hear me.""

At that moment the hall-door was opened and Mr. Browne came in from the doorstep, laughing as if his heart would break. He was dressed in a long green overcoat with mock astrakhan cuffs and collar and wore on his head an oval fur cap. He pointed down the snow-covered quay from where the sound of shrill prolonged whistling was borne in.

""Teddy will have all the cabs in Dublin out,"" he said.

Gabriel advanced from the little pantry behind the office, struggling into his overcoat and, looking round the hall, said:

""Gretta not down yet?""

""She's getting on her things, Gabriel,"" said Aunt Kate.

""Who's playing up there?"" asked Gabriel.

""Nobody. They're all gone.""

""O no, Aunt Kate,"" said Mary Jane. ""Bartell D'Arcy and Miss O'Callaghan aren't gone yet.""

""Someone is fooling at the piano anyhow,"" said Gabriel.

Mary Jane glanced at Gabriel and Mr. Browne and said with a shiver:

""It makes me feel cold to look at you two gentlemen muffled up like that. I wouldn't like to face your journey home at this hour.""

""I'd like nothing better this minute,"" said Mr. Browne stoutly, ""than a rattling fine walk in the country or a fast drive with a good spanking goer between the shafts.""

""We used to have a very good horse and trap at home,"" said Aunt Julia sadly.

""The never-to-be-forgotten Johnny,"" said Mary Jane, laughing.

Aunt Kate and Gabriel laughed too.

""Why, what was wonderful about Johnny?"" asked Mr. Browne.

""The late lamented Patrick Morkan, our grandfather, that is,"" explained Gabriel, ""commonly known in his later years as the old gentleman, was a glue-boiler.""

""O, now, Gabriel,"" said Aunt Kate, laughing, ""he had a starch mill.""

""Well, glue or starch,"" said Gabriel, ""the old gentleman had a horse by the name of Johnny. And Johnny used to work in the old gentleman's mill, walking round and round in order to drive the mill. That was all very well; but now comes the tragic part about Johnny. One fine day the old gentleman thought he'd like to drive out with the quality to a military review in the park.""

""The Lord have mercy on his soul,"" said Aunt Kate compassionately.

""Amen,"" said Gabriel. ""So the old gentleman, as I said, harnessed Johnny and put on his very best tall hat and his very best stock collar and drove out in grand style from his ancestral mansion somewhere near Back Lane, I think.""

Everyone laughed, even Mrs. Malins, at Gabriel's manner and Aunt Kate said:

""O, now, Gabriel, he didn't live in Back Lane, really. Only the mill was there.""

""Out from the mansion of his forefathers,"" continued Gabriel, ""he drove with Johnny. And everything went on beautifully until Johnny came in sight of King Billy's statue: and whether he fell in love with the horse King Billy sits on or whether he thought he was back again in the mill, anyhow he began to walk round the statue.""

Gabriel paced in a circle round the hall in his goloshes amid the laughter of the others.

""Round and round he went,"" said Gabriel, ""and the old gentleman, who was a very pompous old gentleman, was highly indignant. 'Go on, sir! What do you mean, sir? Johnny! Johnny! Most extraordinary conduct! Can't understand the horse!""

The peal of laughter which followed Gabriel's imitation of the incident was interrupted by a resounding knock at the hall door. Mary Jane ran to open it and let in Freddy Malins. Freddy Malins, with his hat well back on his head and his shoulders humped with cold, was puffing and steaming after his exertions.

""I could only get one cab,"" he said.

""O, we'll find another along the quay,"" said Gabriel.

""Yes,"" said Aunt Kate. ""Better not keep Mrs. Malins standing in the draught.""

Mrs. Malins was helped down the front steps by her son and Mr. Browne and, after many manoeuvres, hoisted into the cab. Freddy Malins clambered in after her and spent a long time settling her on the seat, Mr. Browne helping him with advice. At last she was settled comfortably and Freddy Malins invited Mr. Browne into the cab. There was a good deal of confused talk, and then Mr. Browne got into the cab. The cabman settled his rug over his knees, and bent down for the address. The confusion grew greater and the cabman was directed differently by Freddy Malins and Mr. Browne, each of whom had his head out through a window of the cab. The difficulty was to know where to drop Mr. Browne along the route, and Aunt Kate, Aunt Julia and Mary Jane helped the discussion from the doorstep with cross-directions and contradictions and abundance of laughter. As for Freddy Malins he was speechless with laughter. He popped his head in and out of the window every moment to the great danger of his hat, and told his mother how the discussion was progressing, till at last Mr. Browne shouted to the bewildered cabman above the din of everybody's laughter:

""Do you know Trinity College?""

""Yes, sir,"" said the cabman.

""Well, drive bang up against Trinity College gates,"" said Mr. Browne, ""and then we'll tell you where to go. You understand now?""

""Yes, sir,"" said the cabman.

""Make like a bird for Trinity College.""

""Right, sir,"" said the cabman.

The horse was whipped up and the cab rattled off along the quay amid a chorus of laughter and adieus.

Gabriel had not gone to the door with the others. He was in a dark part of the hall gazing up the staircase. A woman was standing near the top of the first flight, in the shadow also. He could not see her face but he could see the terra-cotta and salmon-pink panels of her skirt which the shadow made appear black and white. It was his wife. She was leaning on the banisters, listening to something. Gabriel was surprised at her stillness and strained his ear to listen also. But he could hear little save the noise of laughter and dispute on the front steps, a few chords struck on the piano and a few notes of a man's voice singing.

He stood still in the gloom of the hall, trying to catch the air that the voice was singing and gazing up at his wife. There was grace and mystery in her attitude as if she were a symbol of something. He asked himself what is a woman standing on the stairs in the shadow, listening to distant music, a symbol of. If he were a painter he would paint her in that attitude. Her blue felt hat would show off the bronze of her hair against the darkness and the dark panels of her skirt would show off the light ones. Distant Music he would call the picture if he were a painter.

The hall-door was closed; and Aunt Kate, Aunt Julia and Mary Jane came down the hall, still laughing.

""Well, isn't Freddy terrible?"" said Mary Jane. ""He's really terrible.""

Gabriel said nothing but pointed up the stairs towards where his wife was standing. Now that the hall-door was closed the voice and the piano could be heard more clearly. Gabriel held up his hand for them to be silent. The song seemed to be in the old Irish tonality and the singer seemed uncertain both of his words and of his voice. The voice, made plaintive by distance and by the singer's hoarseness, faintly illuminated the cadence of the air with words expressing grief:

O, the rain falls on my heavy locks
And the dew wets my skin
My babe lies cold...

""O,"" exclaimed Mary Jane. ""It's Bartell D'Arcy singing and he wouldn't sing all the night. O, I'll get him to sing a song before he goes.""

""O, do, Mary Jane,"" said Aunt Kate.

Mary Jane brushed past the others and ran to the staircase, but before she reached it the singing stopped and the piano was closed abruptly.

""O, what a pity!"" she cried. ""Is he coming down, Gretta?""

Gabriel heard his wife answer yes and saw her come down towards them. A few steps behind her were Mr. Bartell D'Arcy and Miss O'Callaghan.

""O, Mr. D'Arcy,"" cried Mary Jane, ""it's downright mean of you to break off like that when we were all in raptures listening to you.""

""I have been at him all the evening,"" said Miss O'Callaghan, ""and Mrs. Conroy, too, and he told us he had a dreadful cold and couldn't sing.""

""O, Mr. D'Arcy,"" said Aunt Kate, ""now that was a great fib to tell.""

""Can't you see that I'm as hoarse as a crow?"" said Mr. D'Arcy roughly

He went into the pantry hastily and put on his overcoat. The others, taken aback by his rude speech, could find nothing to say. Aunt Kate wrinkled her brows and made signs to the others to drop the subject. Mr. D'Arcy stood swathing his neck carefully and frowning.

""It's the weather,"" said Aunt Julia, after a pause.

""Yes, everybody has colds,"" said Aunt Kate readily, ""everybody.""

""They say,"" said Mary Jane, ""we haven't had snow like it for thirty years; and I read this morning in the newspapers that the snow is general all over Ireland.""

""I love the look of snow,"" said Aunt Julia sadly.

""So do I,"" said Miss O'Callaghan. ""I think Christmas is never really Christmas unless we have the snow on the ground.""

""But poor Mr. D'Arcy doesn't like the snow,"" said Aunt Kate, smiling.

Mr. D'Arcy came from the pantry, fully swathed and buttoned, and in a repentant tone told them the history of his cold. Everyone gave him advice and said it was a great pity and urged him to be very careful of his throat in the night air. Gabriel watched his wife, who did not join in the conversation. She was standing right under the dusty fanlight and the flame of the gas lit up the rich bronze of her hair, which he had seen her drying at the fire a few days before. She was in the same attitude and seemed unaware of the talk about her At last she turned towards them and Gabriel saw that there was colour on her cheeks and that her eyes were shining. A sudden tide of joy went leaping out of his heart.

""Mr. D'Arcy,"" she said, ""what is the name of that song you were singing?""

""It's called The Lass of Aughrim,"" said Mr. D'Arcy, ""but I couldn't remember it properly. Why? Do you know it?""

""The Lass of Aughrim,"" she repeated. ""I couldn't think of the name.""

""It's a very nice air,"" said Mary Jane. ""I'm sorry you were not in voice tonight.""

""Now, Mary Jane,"" said Aunt Kate, ""don't annoy Mr. D'Arcy. I won't have him annoyed.""

Seeing that all were ready to start she shepherded them to the door, where good-night was said:

""Well, good-night, Aunt Kate, and thanks for the pleasant evening.""

""Good-night, Gabriel. Good-night, Gretta!""

""Good-night, Aunt Kate, and thanks ever so much. Goodnight, Aunt Julia.""

""O, good-night, Gretta, I didn't see you.""

""Good-night, Mr. D'Arcy. Good-night, Miss O'Callaghan.""

""Good-night, Miss Morkan.""

""Good-night, again.""

""Good-night, all. Safe home.""

""Good-night. Good night.""

The morning was still dark. A dull, yellow light brooded over the houses and the river; and the sky seemed to be descending. It was slushy underfoot; and only streaks and patches of snow lay on the roofs, on the parapets of the quay and on the area railings. The lamps were still burning redly in the murky air and, across the river, the palace of the Four Courts stood out menacingly against the heavy sky.

She was walking on before him with Mr. Bartell D'Arcy, her shoes in a brown parcel tucked under one arm and her hands holding her skirt up from the slush. She had no longer any grace of attitude, but Gabriel's eyes were still bright with happiness. The blood went bounding along his veins; and the thoughts went rioting through his brain, proud, joyful, tender, valorous.

She was walking on before him so lightly and so erect that he longed to run after her noiselessly, catch her by the shoulders and say something foolish and affectionate into her ear. She seemed to him so frail that he longed to defend her against something and then to be alone with her. Moments of their secret life together burst like stars upon his memory. A heliotrope envelope was lying beside his breakfast-cup and he was caressing it with his hand. Birds were twittering in the ivy and the sunny web of the curtain was shimmering along the floor: he could not eat for happiness. They were standing on the crowded platform and he was placing a ticket inside the warm palm of her glove. He was standing with her in the cold, looking in through a grated window at a man making bottles in a roaring furnace. It was very cold. Her face, fragrant in the cold air, was quite close to his; and suddenly he called out to the man at the furnace:

""Is the fire hot, sir?""

But the man could not hear with the noise of the furnace. It was just as well. He might have answered rudely.

A wave of yet more tender joy escaped from his heart and went coursing in warm flood along his arteries. Like the tender fire of stars moments of their life together, that no one knew of or would ever know of, broke upon and illumined his memory. He longed to recall to her those moments, to make her forget the years of their dull existence together and remember only their moments of ecstasy. For the years, he felt, had not quenched his soul or hers. Their children, his writing, her household cares had not quenched all their souls' tender fire. In one letter that he had written to her then he had said: ""Why is it that words like these seem to me so dull and cold? Is it because there is no word tender enough to be your name?""

Like distant music these words that he had written years before were borne towards him from the past. He longed to be alone with her. When the others had gone away, when he and she were in the room in the hotel, then they would be alone together. He would call her softly:

""Gretta!""

Perhaps she would not hear at once: she would be undressing. Then something in his voice would strike her. She would turn and look at him....

At the corner of Winetavern Street they met a cab. He was glad of its rattling noise as it saved him from conversation. She was looking out of the window and seemed tired. The others spoke only a few words, pointing out some building or street. The horse galloped along wearily under the murky morning sky, dragging his old rattling box after his heels, and Gabriel was again in a cab with her, galloping to catch the boat, galloping to their honeymoon.

As the cab drove across O'Connell Bridge Miss O'Callaghan said:

""They say you never cross O'Connell Bridge without seeing a white horse.""

""I see a white man this time,"" said Gabriel.

""Where?"" asked Mr. Bartell D'Arcy.

Gabriel pointed to the statue, on which lay patches of snow. Then he nodded familiarly to it and waved his hand.

""Good-night, Dan,"" he said gaily.

When the cab drew up before the hotel, Gabriel jumped out and, in spite of Mr. Bartell D'Arcy's protest, paid the driver. He gave the man a shilling over his fare. The man saluted and said:

""A prosperous New Year to you, sir.""

""The same to you,"" said Gabriel cordially.

She leaned for a moment on his arm in getting out of the cab and while standing at the curbstone, bidding the others good- night. She leaned lightly on his arm, as lightly as when she had danced with him a few hours before. He had felt proud and happy then, happy that she was his, proud of her grace and wifely carriage. But now, after the kindling again of so many memories, the first touch of her body, musical and strange and perfumed, sent through him a keen pang of lust. Under cover of her silence he pressed her arm closely to his side; and, as they stood at the hotel door, he felt that they had escaped from their lives and duties, escaped from home and friends and run away together with wild and radiant hearts to a new adventure.

An old man was dozing in a great hooded chair in the hall. He lit a candle in the office and went before them to the stairs. They followed him in silence, their feet falling in soft thuds on the thickly carpeted stairs. She mounted the stairs behind the porter, her head bowed in the ascent, her frail shoulders curved as with a burden, her skirt girt tightly about her. He could have flung his arms about her hips and held her still, for his arms were trembling with desire to seize her and only the stress of his nails against the palms of his hands held the wild impulse of his body in check. The porter halted on the stairs to settle his guttering candle. They halted, too, on the steps below him. In the silence Gabriel could hear the falling of the molten wax into the tray and the thumping of his own heart against his ribs.

The porter led them along a corridor and opened a door. Then he set his unstable candle down on a toilet-table and asked at what hour they were to be called in the morning.

""Eight,"" said Gabriel.

The porter pointed to the tap of the electric-light and began a muttered apology, but Gabriel cut him short.

""We don't want any light. We have light enough from the street. And I say,"" he added, pointing to the candle, ""you might remove that handsome article, like a good man.""

The porter took up his candle again, but slowly, for he was surprised by such a novel idea. Then he mumbled good-night and went out. Gabriel shot the lock to.

A ghastly light from the street lamp lay in a long shaft from one window to the door. Gabriel threw his overcoat and hat on a couch and crossed the room towards the window. He looked down into the street in order that his emotion might calm a little. Then he turned and leaned against a chest of drawers with his back to the light. She had taken off her hat and cloak and was standing before a large swinging mirror, unhooking her waist. Gabriel paused for a few moments, watching her, and then said:

""Gretta!""

She turned away from the mirror slowly and walked along the shaft of light towards him. Her face looked so serious and weary that the words would not pass Gabriel's lips. No, it was not the moment yet.

""You looked tired,"" he said.

""I am a little,"" she answered.

""You don't feel ill or weak?""

""No, tired: that's all.""

She went on to the window and stood there, looking out. Gabriel waited again and then, fearing that diffidence was about to conquer him, he said abruptly:

""By the way, Gretta!""

""What is it?""

""You know that poor fellow Malins?"" he said quickly.

""Yes. What about him?""

""Well, poor fellow, he's a decent sort of chap, after all,"" continued Gabriel in a false voice. ""He gave me back that sovereign I lent him, and I didn't expect it, really. It's a pity he wouldn't keep away from that Browne, because he's not a bad fellow, really.""

He was trembling now with annoyance. Why did she seem so abstracted? He did not know how he could begin. Was she annoyed, too, about something? If she would only turn to him or come to him of her own accord! To take her as she was would be brutal. No, he must see some ardour in her eyes first. He longed to be master of her strange mood.

""When did you lend him the pound?"" she asked, after a pause.

Gabriel strove to restrain himself from breaking out into brutal language about the sottish Malins and his pound. He longed to cry to her from his soul, to crush her body against his, to overmaster her. But he said:

""O, at Christmas, when he opened that little Christmas-card shop in Henry Street.""

He was in such a fever of rage and desire that he did not hear her come from the window. She stood before him for an instant, looking at him strangely. Then, suddenly raising herself on tiptoe and resting her hands lightly on his shoulders, she kissed him.

""You are a very generous person, Gabriel,"" she said.

Gabriel, trembling with delight at her sudden kiss and at the quaintness of her phrase, put his hands on her hair and began smoothing it back, scarcely touching it with his fingers. The washing had made it fine and brilliant. His heart was brimming over with happiness. Just when he was wishing for it she had come to him of her own accord. Perhaps her thoughts had been running with his. Perhaps she had felt the impetuous desire that was in him, and then the yielding mood had come upon her. Now that she had fallen to him so easily, he wondered why he had been so diffident.

He stood, holding her head between his hands. Then, slipping one arm swiftly about her body and drawing her towards him, he said softly:

""Gretta, dear, what are you thinking about?""

She did not answer nor yield wholly to his arm. He said again, softly:

""Tell me what it is, Gretta. I think I know what is the matter. Do I know?""

She did not answer at once. Then she said in an outburst of tears:

""O, I am thinking about that song, The Lass of Aughrim.""

She broke loose from him and ran to the bed and, throwing her arms across the bed-rail, hid her face. Gabriel stood stockstill for a moment in astonishment and then followed her. As he passed in the way of the cheval-glass he caught sight of himself in full length, his broad, well-filled shirt-front, the face whose expression always puzzled him when he saw it in a mirror, and his glimmering gilt-rimmed eyeglasses. He halted a few paces from her and said:

""What about the song? Why does that make you cry?""

She raised her head from her arms and dried her eyes with the back of her hand like a child. A kinder note than he had intended went into his voice.

""Why, Gretta?"" he asked.

""I am thinking about a person long ago who used to sing that song.""

""And who was the person long ago?"" asked Gabriel, smiling.

""It was a person I used to know in Galway when I was living with my grandmother,"" she said.

The smile passed away from Gabriel's face. A dull anger began to gather again at the back of his mind and the dull fires of his lust began to glow angrily in his veins.

""Someone you were in love with?"" he asked ironically.

""It was a young boy I used to know,"" she answered, ""named Michael Furey. He used to sing that song, The Lass of Aughrim. He was very delicate.""

Gabriel was silent. He did not wish her to think that he was interested in this delicate boy.

""I can see him so plainly,"" she said, after a moment. ""Such eyes as he had: big, dark eyes! And such an expression in them -- an expression!""

""O, then, you are in love with him?"" said Gabriel.

""I used to go out walking with him,"" she said, ""when I was in Galway.""

A thought flew across Gabriel's mind.

""Perhaps that was why you wanted to go to Galway with that Ivors girl?"" he said coldly.

She looked at him and asked in surprise:

""What for?""

Her eyes made Gabriel feel awkward. He shrugged his shoulders and said:

""How do I know? To see him, perhaps.""

She looked away from him along the shaft of light towards the window in silence.

""He is dead,"" she said at length. ""He died when he was only seventeen. Isn't it a terrible thing to die so young as that?""

""What was he?"" asked Gabriel, still ironically.

""He was in the gasworks,"" she said.

Gabriel felt humiliated by the failure of his irony and by the evocation of this figure from the dead, a boy in the gasworks. While he had been full of memories of their secret life together, full of tenderness and joy and desire, she had been comparing him in her mind with another. A shameful consciousness of his own person assailed him. He saw himself as a ludicrous figure, acting as a pennyboy for his aunts, a nervous, well-meaning sentimentalist, orating to vulgarians and idealising his own clownish lusts, the pitiable fatuous fellow he had caught a glimpse of in the mirror. Instinctively he turned his back more to the light lest she might see the shame that burned upon his forehead.

He tried to keep up his tone of cold interrogation, but his voice when he spoke was humble and indifferent.

""I suppose you were in love with this Michael Furey, Gretta,"" he said.

""I was great with him at that time,"" she said.

Her voice was veiled and sad. Gabriel, feeling now how vain it would be to try to lead her whither he had purposed, caressed one of her hands and said, also sadly:

""And what did he die of so young, Gretta? Consumption, was it?""

""I think he died for me,"" she answered.

A vague terror seized Gabriel at this answer, as if, at that hour when he had hoped to triumph, some impalpable and vindictive being was coming against him, gathering forces against him in its vague world. But he shook himself free of it with an effort of reason and continued to caress her hand. He did not question her again, for he felt that she would tell him of herself. Her hand was warm and moist: it did not respond to his touch, but he continued to caress it just as he had caressed her first letter to him that spring morning.

""It was in the winter,"" she said, ""about the beginning of the winter when I was going to leave my grandmother's and come up here to the convent. And he was ill at the time in his lodgings in Galway and wouldn't be let out, and his people in Oughterard were written to. He was in decline, they said, or something like that. I never knew rightly.""

She paused for a moment and sighed.

""Poor fellow,"" she said. ""He was very fond of me and he was such a gentle boy. We used to go out together, walking, you know, Gabriel, like the way they do in the country. He was going to study singing only for his health. He had a very good voice, poor Michael Furey.""

""Well; and then?"" asked Gabriel.

""And then when it came to the time for me to leave Galway and come up to the convent he was much worse and I wouldn't be let see him so I wrote him a letter saying I was going up to Dublin and would be back in the summer, and hoping he would be better then.""

She paused for a moment to get her voice under control, and then went on:

""Then the night before I left, I was in my grandmother's house in Nuns' Island, packing up, and I heard gravel thrown up against the window. The window was so wet I couldn't see, so I ran downstairs as I was and slipped out the back into the garden and there was the poor fellow at the end of the garden, shivering.""

""And did you not tell him to go back?"" asked Gabriel.

""I implored of him to go home at once and told him he would get his death in the rain. But he said he did not want to live. I can see his eyes as well as well! He was standing at the end of the wall where there was a tree.""

""And did he go home?"" asked Gabriel.

""Yes, he went home. And when I was only a week in the convent he died and he was buried in Oughterard, where his people came from. O, the day I heard that, that he was dead!""

She stopped, choking with sobs, and, overcome by emotion, flung herself face downward on the bed, sobbing in the quilt. Gabriel held her hand for a moment longer, irresolutely, and then, shy of intruding on her grief, let it fall gently and walked quietly to the window.

She was fast asleep.

Gabriel, leaning on his elbow, looked for a few moments unresentfully on her tangled hair and half-open mouth, listening to her deep-drawn breath. So she had had that romance in her life: a man had died for her sake. It hardly pained him now to think how poor a part he, her husband, had played in her life. He watched her while she slept, as though he and she had never lived together as man and wife. His curious eyes rested long upon her face and on her hair: and, as he thought of what she must have been then, in that time of her first girlish beauty, a strange, friendly pity for her entered his soul. He did not like to say even to himself that her face was no longer beautiful, but he knew that it was no longer the face for which Michael Furey had braved death.

Perhaps she had not told him all the story. His eyes moved to the chair over which she had thrown some of her clothes. A petticoat string dangled to the floor. One boot stood upright, its limp upper fallen down: the fellow of it lay upon its side. He wondered at his riot of emotions of an hour before. From what had it proceeded? From his aunt's supper, from his own foolish speech, from the wine and dancing, the merry-making when saying good-night in the hall, the pleasure of the walk along the river in the snow. Poor Aunt Julia! She, too, would soon be a shade with the shade of Patrick Morkan and his horse. He had caught that haggard look upon her face for a moment when she was singing Arrayed for the Bridal. Soon, perhaps, he would be sitting in that same drawing-room, dressed in black, his silk hat on his knees. The blinds would be drawn down and Aunt Kate would be sitting beside him, crying and blowing her nose and telling him how Julia had died. He would cast about in his mind for some words that might console her, and would find only lame and useless ones. Yes, yes: that would happen very soon.

The air of the room chilled his shoulders. He stretched himself cautiously along under the sheets and lay down beside his wife. One by one, they were all becoming shades. Better pass boldly into that other world, in the full glory of some passion, than fade and wither dismally with age. He thought of how she who lay beside him had locked in her heart for so many years that image of her lover's eyes when he had told her that he did not wish to live.

Generous tears filled Gabriel's eyes. He had never felt like that himself towards any woman, but he knew that such a feeling must be love. The tears gathered more thickly in his eyes and in the partial darkness he imagined he saw the form of a young man standing under a dripping tree. Other forms were near. His soul had approached that region where dwell the vast hosts of the dead. He was conscious of, but could not apprehend, their wayward and flickering existence. His own identity was fading out into a grey impalpable world: the solid world itself, which these dead had one time reared and lived in, was dissolving and dwindling.

A few light taps upon the pane made him turn to the window. It had begun to snow again. He watched sleepily the flakes, silver and dark, falling obliquely against the lamplight. The time had come for him to set out on his journey westward. Yes, the newspapers were right: snow was general all over Ireland. It was falling on every part of the dark central plain, on the treeless hills, falling softly upon the Bog of Allen and, farther westward, softly falling into the dark mutinous Shannon waves. It was falling, too, upon every part of the lonely churchyard on the hill where Michael Furey lay buried. It lay thickly drifted on the crooked crosses and headstones, on the spears of the little gate, on the barren thorns. His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead.",James Joyce,1977,"[43, 46, 56, 66, 77, 88, 47, 52, 58, 60, 60, 70]",12

I met real badman, I met criers

Witness murders, creating riots

And that I've been waking up alone

That you ain't ever coming home

Cause the boat's in the bay and it's calling my name

Kinda making eyes at me

450,Reach,"[Verse 1]
(Hey the afro villain is back?)
Hi my name is A-F-R-O, what’s up y'all?
I am a literal, lyrical, little nigga with an earful of peer
Mere, sheer into feared cleared middlemen
Flow inactive, coping out with the coke bag
Hold back, flow chance, shows growing in advance
Knowing the fast, blowing the pass, hoping and coping an omen to dance
Flowing and roaming is leaving his hoe with a dope under
Beat too slow with his hands
(Tokyo mobster)
Godzilla rocking, knocking, iller stomping on the killer marker
Fonder stomp McCarthy villain with Islamic scriptures
Twist the picture, rip it, swivel it into slivers
In the image, killing off the minutes
(What the fuck?)
Sipping with your mama, in the office kicking on the liver
Cinnamon bitches driving titty zombies over the city
Posting ovaries, and I’m stirring the soup
First verse earning the loot, earn worse words, you’re a doofus
(Hold out)
Roar for raw town, raw pound, show ‘em out
White cheesy people like you full house
Mic seething evil, leaving bleeding sheeple rolling down
Even Stevens, dream of meeting the master
(That’s KRS)
Rap attack feed the rest, half-assed be the bet
Matter of fact I’m laughing and I’m stacking up the amulets

[Chorus]
I’m feeling so groovy now, Afro’s flow fuck your head up
Let’s begin it like this, the definition of a rap flow, I’mma reinvent it like this
I’m feeling so groovy now, Afro’s flow fuck your head up
Let’s begin it like this, the definition of a rap flow, I’mma reinvent it like this
Afro is along rap to save the day

[Verse 2]
Medicine, eminent, feminist
Sentimental with edges of lead or metals
Settled in envision listen to ed and minimal
And ripping a little bit, sending in a villain
Im Feeling a little bit envy
In the bit ending rhythm is heavy rhythm is ending
Put em in training, lazy raising, amazing ages that Asian faces
Stay’in ya lane in the rapist cave and layin’ in the safe havens
Master us, the hazardous, half-magical, black kid
Stabbed and catapult rap, fashionable
I’m half of animal slash cannibalistic aneurysm
Trapped in the manner of rapping wisdom and I’m manifold
Rakim taught me to grab the microphone and slap the mighty hoes that try to_ pie ya from my snotty nose
I am on the world to save ya, robbing all the virgin players
Rhyming urban betrayers to swerve in layers
Im in the urge for learning that the  maker
Serving a murderous rage  assuring him an burning it with affirmative data
Earning a whip, burning the matches, hah
16 year old kid murdering burdens asserting the damage
Hah motherfucker you don’t understand
Kick you in the head like RA did to Macklemore
Legend never dies stop phasing atta boy that annoyed

[Chorus]
I’m feeling so groovy now, Afro’s flow fuck your head up
Let’s begin it like this, the definition of a rap flow, I’mma reinvent it like this
I’m feeling so groovy now, Afro’s flow fuck your head up

That I could make it on my own

Since you left
I hardly make it through the day
My tears get in the way
And I need you back to stay

I wander through the night
And search the world to find
The words to make it right

All I want is just
The way it used to be
With you here close to me
I've got to make you see

That I'm lost without your love
Life without you
Isn't worth the trouble of

I'm as helpless
As a ship without a wheel
A touch without a feel
I can't believe it's real

And someday soon
I'll wake
And find my heart
Won't have to break

Yes, I'm lost without your love
Life without you isn't
Worth the trouble of

All I want is just
The way it used to be
I need you here with me

459,Race Among The Ruins,"You think you had the last laugh
Now you know this can't be true
Even though the sun shines down upon you now
Sometimes you must feel blue
You make the best of each new day
You try not to be sad
Even though the sky falls down upon you
Call it midnight feelin' bad

When you wake up to the promise
Of your dream world comin' true
With one less friend to call on
Was it someone that I knew
Away you will go sailin'
In a race among the ruins
If you plan to face tomorrow
Do it soon

The road to love is littered
By the bones of other ones
Who by the magic of the moment
Were mysteriously undone
You try to understand it
But you never seem to find
Any kind of freedom comin' clean
Is just another state of mind

When you wake up to the promise
Of your dream world comin' true
With one less friend to call on
Was it someone that I knew
Away you will go sailin'
In a race among the ruins
If you plan to face tomorrow
Do it soon

So take the best of all that's left
You know this cannot last
Even though your mother was your maker
From her apron strings you pass
Just think about the fool
Who by his virtue can be found
In a most unusual situation
Playin' jester to the clown

When you wake up to the promise
Of your dream world comin' true
With one less friend to call on
Was it someone that I knew
Away you will go sailin'
In a race among the ruins
If you plan to face tomorrow
Do it soon

When you wake up to the promise
Of your dream world comin' true
With one less friend to call on
Was it someone that I knew
Away you will go sailin'
In a race among the ruins
If you plan to face tomorrow
Do it soon",Gordon Lightfoot,1977,"[67, 65, 70, 83]",4
460,Welcome To Our World (Of Merry Music),"SCENE VII. The forest

DUKE SENIOR
I think he be transform'd into a beast;
For I can no where find him like a man.

FIRST LORD
My lord, he is but even now gone hence:
Here was he merry, hearing of a song.

If he, compact of jars, grow musical,
We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.
Go, seek him: tell him I would speak with him.

FIRST LORD
He saves my labour by his own approach.

Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this
That your poor friends must woo your company?
What, you look merrily!

A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' the forest,
A motley fool; a miserable world!
As I do live by food, I met a fool
Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,
And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,
In good set terms and yet a motley fool.
'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I. 'No, sir,' quoth he,
'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune:'
And then he drew a dial from his poke,
And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,
Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock:
Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags:
'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,
And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;
And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,
And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;
And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear
The motley fool thus moral on the time,
My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,
That fools should be so deep-contemplative,
And I did laugh sans intermission
An hour by his dial. O noble fool!
A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.

DUKE SENIOR
What fool is this?

JAQUES
O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,
And says, if ladies be but young and fair,
They have the gift to know it: and in his brain,
Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd
With observation, the which he vents
In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!
I am ambitious for a motley coat.

DUKE SENIOR
Thou shalt have one.

JAQUES
It is my only suit;
Provided that you weed your better judgments
Of all opinion that grows rank in them
That I am wise. I must have liberty
Withal, as large a charter as the wind,
To blow on whom I please; for so fools have;
And they that are most galled with my folly,
They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?
The 'why' is plain as way to parish church:
He that a fool doth very wisely hit
Doth very foolishly, although he smart,
Not to seem senseless of the bob: if not,
The wise man's folly is anatomized
Even by the squandering glances of the fool.
Invest me in my motley; give me leave
To speak my mind, and I will through and through
Cleanse the foul body of the infected world,
If they will patiently receive my medicine.

DUKE SENIOR
Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.

JAQUES
What, for a counter, would I do but good?

DUKE SENIOR
Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin:
For thou thyself hast been a libertine,
As sensual as the brutish sting itself;
And all the embossed sores and headed evils,
That thou with licence of free foot hast caught,
Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.

JAQUES
Why, who cries out on pride,
That can therein tax any private party?
Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,
Till that the weary very means do ebb?
What woman in the city do I name,
When that I say the city-woman bears
The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?
Who can come in and say that I mean her,
When such a one as she such is her neighbour?
Or what is he of basest function
That says his bravery is not of my cost,
Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits
His folly to the mettle of my speech?
There then; how then? what then? Let me see wherein
My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,
Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,
Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,
Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?

Enter ORLANDO, with his sword drawn

ORLANDO
Forbear, and eat no more.

JAQUES
Why, I have eat none yet.

ORLANDO
Nor shalt not, till necessity be served.

JAQUES
Of what kind should this cock come of?

DUKE SENIOR
Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress,
Or else a rude despiser of good manners,
That in civility thou seem'st so empty?

ORLANDO
You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point
Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show
Of smooth civility: yet am I inland bred
And know some nurture. But forbear, I say:
He dies that touches any of this fruit
Till I and my affairs are answered.

JAQUES
An you will not be answered with reason, I must die.

DUKE SENIOR
What would you have? Your gentleness shall force
More than your force move us to gentleness.

ORLANDO
I almost die for food; and let me have it.

DUKE SENIOR
Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.

ORLANDO
Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you:
I thought that all things had been savage here;
And therefore put I on the countenance
Of stern commandment. But whate'er you are
That in this desert inaccessible,
Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time
If ever you have look'd on better days,
If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,
If ever sat at any good man's feast,
If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear
And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,
Let gentleness my strong enforcement be:
In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.

DUKE SENIOR
True is it that we have seen better days,
And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church
And sat at good men's feasts and wiped our eyes
Of drops that sacred pity hath engender'd:
And therefore sit you down in gentleness
And take upon command what help we have
That to your wanting may be minister'd.

ORLANDO
Then but forbear your food a little while,
Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn
And give it food. There is an old poor man,
Who after me hath many a weary step
Limp'd in pure love: till he be first sufficed,
Oppress'd with two weak evils, age and hunger,
I will not touch a bit.

DUKE SENIOR
Go find him out,
And we will nothing waste till you return.

ORLANDO
I thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!

Exit

DUKE SENIOR
Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:
This wide and universal theatre
Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
Wherein we play in.

JAQUES
All the world's a stage,
And all the men and women merely players:
They have their exits and their entrances;
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

Re-enter ORLANDO, with ADAM

DUKE SENIOR
Welcome. Set down your venerable burthen,
And let him feed.

ORLANDO
I thank you most for him.

ADAM
So had you need:
I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.

DUKE SENIOR
Welcome; fall to: I will not trouble you
As yet, to question you about your fortunes.
Give us some music; and, good cousin, sing.

SONG.

AMIENS
Blow, blow, thou winter wind.
Thou art not so unkind
As man's ingratitude;
Thy tooth is not so keen,
Because thou art not seen,
Although thy breath be rude.
Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly:
Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly:
Then, heigh-ho, the holly!
This life is most jolly.
Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,
That dost not bite so nigh
As benefits forgot:
Though thou the waters warp,
Thy sting is not so sharp
As friend remember'd not.
Heigh-ho! sing, & c.

DUKE SENIOR
If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son,
As you have whisper'd faithfully you were,
And as mine eye doth his effigies witness
Most truly limn'd and living in your face,
Be truly welcome hither: I am the duke
That loved your father: the residue of your fortune,
Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,
Thou art right welcome as thy master is.
Support him by the arm. Give me your hand,
And let me all your fortunes understand.

461,Dazz,"[Verse 1]
You got diamonds in your eyes tonight
Throwing fire, trying to make it right
You’re getting higher than the ceiling lights
And falling hard enough to lose the fight

[Pre-Chorus]
Not in it for the money, just in it for the thrill
Living in the moment, paying for the kill
Golden grill of sadness, mid-life wasted youth
Always ends up like this, always gonna lose

[Chorus]
Dazzle me, dazzle me, dazzle me with gold
You’ll never be what you wanna be with all that money, that money
Dazzle me, dazzle me, throw away your gold
You’ll never be what you wanna be with all that money, that money, that money

[Verse 2]
There’s a human in your heart of hearts
Hiding true colours made you fall apart
In the mirror you’re a work of art
But this is real life, real life

Not in it for the money, just in it for the thrill
Living in the moment, paying for the kill
Golden grill of sadness, mid-life wasted youth
Always ends up like this, always gonna lose

You’ll never be what you wanna be with all that money, that money
Dazzle me, dazzle me, throw away your gold

[Bridge]
Give me neon lights, roll me paper heights
I can feel the dice, cooling me
See the plastic life through my bloodshot eyes
I am wild alive, I am wild alive

Not in it for the money, just in it for the thrill
Living in the moment, paying for the kill
Golden grill of sadness, mid-life wasted youth
Always ends up like this, always gonna lose

Dazzle me, dazzle me, dazzle me with gold
You’ll never be what you wanna be with all that money, that money

[Verse 1]
Backstroking lover, always hiding 'neath the covers
'Til I talked to my daddy, he say
He said, ""You ain't seen nothing 'til you're down on a muffin
Then you're sure to be a-changing your ways.""
I met a cheerleader, was a real young bleeder
All the times I could reminisce
'Cause the best things of loving with her sister and her cousin
Only started with a little kiss, like this

[Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
See-saw swinging with the boys in the school
With your feet flying up in the air
Singing ""Hey, diddle-diddle with your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like I didn't care.""
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was fooling 'cause she knew what she was doing
And I knew love was here to stay when she told me to

[Chorus]
""Walk this way, talk this way""
""Walk this way, walk this way""
""Walk this way, walk this way""
""Walk this way, talk this way""
Ah, just give me a kiss
Like this

[Solo]

[Verse 2]
Schoolgirl sweetie with the classy kinda sassy
Little skirt's climbing way up her knee
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker
When I noticed they was looking at me
I was a high school loser, never made it with a lady
'Til the boys told me something I missed
Then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
So I gave her just a little kiss, like this

[Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
See-saw swinging with the boys in the school
With your feet flying up in the air
Singing ""Hey, diddle-diddle with your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like I didn't care.""
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was fooling 'cause she knew what she was doing
And I knew love was here to stay when she told me to

""Walk this way, walk this way""
""Walk this way, walk this way""
""Walk this way, talk this way""
Just give me a kiss

You wanna come see me tonight

I've gotta hold on, put up some kind of fight

Because I just can't say no to you
Though I know we'd be better off through
But my heart won't admit that it's true
And I just can't say no to you

I guess I never understood
How somethin' so wrong could seem so good
But would I give it up even if I could?
If I'm fallin' let me fall with you

Because I just can't say no to you
Though I know we'd be better off through

I didn't feel as ready as I shoulda done
I feel the time is right

Now and then when I'm on my own
And can't get used to being all this way from home
My heart feels kinda sad

It's a time when I am not sure
Which way my crazy life is pulling me towards
I know I'll always call your name

I'll always call your name
I'll always call your name
I'll always call your name
I'll always call your name

Sometimes I get the feeling
I'm acting like a fool
But then I get ambition
And it tends to overrule

And even when I'm down
The feeling's just the same
Ain't nothing gonna hurt me
I'll always call your name, name, name

And you've shown me good times and bad
And right from wrong whenever I confuse my head
I still regard you as my home

Just the same if fortune and fame
Should come along and take me down a lonely lane

I'll always call your name

472,Sorry/That's The Trouble,"[Intro, spoken]
So, yeah, this is, um, this is a new song I've written. It's kind of a, sort of jaunty swing number and it's called, um, ""Cont""

[Verse 1]
I don't like Jews
...
Neither should you
They're ethically and spiritually poor, that's a fact

I don't like black people
...
It's just not acceptable
There should be some kind of law that is that

[Verse 2]
And I get the shits with Inuits
...
...
They get on my tits, the little bastards

And women
...
Just make me so mad, does that make me bad?
Am I bad, is that bad?

[Verse 3]
And the fuckin' Italians, I just cannot stand them
...
They really inspire my rancour
Cheating fucking Italian wankers

And lesbians and the bi-curious
Make me furious
...
It's not their fault, I know, but still... grr!

[Verse 4]
And fuckin' Christians
...
I just want to punch 'em in their faces
...

And I'm not comfortable with Muslims on the tube
...
And I can't stand publicly breast-feeding mothers
...

[Verse 5]
And I hate gays who talk camp-ly
...
And the fuckin' Chinese make me angry
...

[Bridge]
I hate the rich...
I hate the poor...
I hate bitches...
I hate whores...

[Outro]
I hate Africans...
I hate Japanese...
I hate the disabled...
I hate Burmese...

Yeah, I don't care about your colour or your creed
I will judge you for no reason...

[Interlude, spoken]
Is that... is that... no, just stop. [Heckler: I love you!] Ohhh. Oh, fuck. Sorry, I... it's, ugh, that's the trouble with trying out new stuff. It's... half the lyr- I had half the lyrics covered up. I thought I was... I was only... I think we, I think we should probably do it again; I think if we leave it there, I might run the risk of being misconstrued. It's not even called ""Cont"", it's called ""Context""!

[Verse 1]
I don't like Jews
Who make and distribute kiddy porn
Neither should you
They're ethically and spiritually poor, that's a fact

I don't like black people
Who risk billions of other peoples money gambling on future derivatives
It's just not acceptable
There should be some kind of law that is that

[Verse 2]
And I get the shits with Inuits
Who find out what job I do
And regale me with a racist joke or two
They get on my tits, the little bastards

And women
Who judge other women for not holding the same views as them vis-a-vis career and mothering
Just make me so mad, does that make me bad?
Am I bad, is that bad?

[Verse 3]
And the fuckin' Italians, I just cannot stand them
When they take a dive in the penalty box, denying Australia its World Cup spot
They really inspire my rancour
Cheating fuckin' Italian wankers

And lesbians and the bi-curious
Make me furious
When their pride parade blocked the traffic flow when my baby had asthma and had to go to the hospital
It's not their fault, I know, but still... grr!

[Verse 4]
And fuckin' Christians
Who lean on their horn when my wife is being cautious at an intersection
I just want to punch them in their faces, although my anger is fleeting
I understand their frustration, she's a little too hesitant

And I'm not comfortable with Muslims on the tube
Who look over my shoulder when I'm reading
And I can't stand publicly breast-feeding mothers
Who smoke cigarettes while they're feeding

[Verse 5]
And I hate gays who talk camp-ly
During the final act of King Lear
And the fuckin' Chinese make me angry
When they make sham erection potions out of the horns of endangered rhinoceros

[Bridge]
I hate the rich who use their wealth as an excuse for bigotry
I hate the poor who use their poverty as an excuse for bigotry
I hate bitches who get rabies and try to bite babies
I hate whores who won't accept Visa

[Outro]
I hate African racists
I hate Japanese homophobes
I hate those disabled rapists
I hate Burmese cats

Yeah, I don't care about your colour or your creed
I will judge you for no reason
But your deeds!

I find myself just missing you
I find myself just wishing you were
Laying by my side

As the day goes on
I'm wondering if you're missing me
I'm wondering if you're wishing we were
Laying side by side

Let me know if you
Feel the way I do
I'll get the message loud and clear

Let yourself come home

Flew in two days ago to see his fam'
But we been watching you, crazily
The whole Staten Island shitting on you

Holding snow in your ear, fresh baldie tried to change up
Not truck today, still looking fly, still slammed up hung
You mind popping your trunk, slow your pace
Starks fixed your face, copped out the six, five years probash'
You dealing with a lot of science, motherfucker we're watching you
Make me wanna lick shots at you
You disgust me, screwing me down, grab my gun
Go head bust me
Heard you hate Jake that's what it must be
Hands behind your back, spread your legs
Just found a roach in your tray
It's not mine fucker, what I said
You make the 13th nigga

So smile when you can, when you can

[Part 1]
It's Crime Time again in Ferraris und Lambos
Das Verbrechen lautet Goodlife, der Tatort Monaco
Ich cruise am Zollamt vorbei, wink' den Grenzpolizisten
Die mich heute noch mustern mit skeptischen Blicken
Doch ich muss weiter zum Airport, raus aus dem Süden Europas
Verabschiedet mit ""Au revoir!"", begrüßt mit ""Aloha!""
Ich date 'ne hochattraktive Hoe aus Brasilien
Mit so 'nem Booty, ey, ich geh' ihr bloß aus Prinzip fremd
Und zwar mit Miss Tahiti auf Karibikschiffreisen
Wo der Bitch offenbar schon im Bikini zu heiß ist
Ich shop' in Gucci-Filialen, hol' mit hungrigem Magen
Knusprig gebratenes Frutti di Mare
Ah, Benvenuto in kulinarischen Welten

La isla bonita, el playa paradiso
Sagenhafte Farbenpracht, als wär's Karneval in Rio
Doch ich lieg' nicht am Strand, mir schlagen Wellen ins Gesicht
Hab' auf der Yacht den Sonnenuntergang exklusiv für mich
Bis ich andock' am Hafen, um den Lambo zu fahren
Jag' ihn mit 120 Sachen durch die Strandpromenade
Ja, ein ganz ohne Frage glanzvoller Wagen
Mit 'nem Cockpit, das aussieht wie 'ne Kommandozentrale
Sitz' nach paar iPhone-Gesprächen in der Kneipe am Tresen
Die als Vorbild dienen könnte für das Nighthawks-Gemälde
In 'ner Bar ohnegleichen mit 'nem Piano in weiß
Und der Schwarze, der es spielt, hat schon Armstrong begleitet
Ah, fahr' dann ins Ritz nicht ohne Lady zurück
Wo ich den Pagen mit 'nem Trinkgeld in die Ferien schick'
Yeah, und schlussendlich die Hure ins Bett werfe
In 'ner Suite, die würde König Ludwig gerecht werden

Ich flanier' Strände entlang mit 'nem Stracciatella-Eis
Dann drop ich für die Cam noch paar Acapella-Lines
Urlaubspics von mir im weißen Lamborghini
Seh' ich irgendwann in 5-Sterne-Reisemagazinen
Ah, ich tret' in Tanzlokale ein, nehm' paar Hoes mit an den Strand
Und vollführe dort den Mambo Number 5
Lass mich morgens dann im Sand von der Sonne wecken
Nach 'ner Nacht wie im Himmelbett und das ganz ohne Wolkendecke
Ah, die Chronik eines Kings
Ich steh' am Balkon, seh' die Sonne am Horizont verschwinden
Blas' den Bluntsmoke in Richtung Orion am Himmel
Vernehm' dann ein gehauchtes ""Antonio"" von hinten
Spür' nur kurz im Nacken die Haare der Latin-Bitch
Da ziehen mich zwei sanfte Arme ins Bett zurück
Und wir vergessen für den Augenblick alle Sorgen
Ah, bis six in the mornin'

Ich kuschel' mich an ihren Hintern gern
Guck' zum Einschlafen Kill Bill und träum' dann, dass ich ein Ninja wär'",Kollegah,1977,[99],1

487,Love So Right,"She came on like the night, and she held on tight
And the world was right when she made love to me
We were free

Started loving me
And I thought I'd found my heaven in her arms
But the morning when I woke up
I was here and she was gone
Now I'm hanging on
Maybe you can tell me

[Chorus]
How a love so right
Can turn out to be so wrong?
Oh, my darling
How a love so right
Can turn out to be so wrong?

Where did she go
When I need her close to me?
And the perfect story ended at the start
I thought you came forever
And you came to break my heart
Now I'm hanging on
On the chance that you'll come back to me
Oh, my love

[Chorus]
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong?
Oh, my darling
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong?

Start living for the moment
Maybe half the things we sought were never there
Simply open up our eyes
And break it down to size

I got your picture hangin' on the wall
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name

No touch can do half as much

Nothing can take your place of being there

492,I Don't Wanna Lose Your Love/Flowers,"[1st Movement]
Desert Rose, why do you live alone?
If you are sad, I'll make you leave this life
Are you white, blue or bloody red?
All I can see is drowning in cold grey sand

The winds of time, you knock me to the ground
I'm dying of thirst, I wanna run away
I don't know how to set me free to live
My mind cries out feeling pain

I've been roaming to find myself
How long have I been feeling endless hurt
Falling down, rain flows into my heart
In the pain I'm waiting for you
Can't go back, no place to go back to
Life is lost, flowers fall
If it's all dreams, now wake me up
If it's all real, just kill me

I'm making the wall inside my heart
I don't wanna let my emotions get out
It scares me to look at the world
Don't want to find myself lost in your eyes
I tried to drown my past in grey
I never wanna feel more pain
Ran away from you without saying any words
What I don't wanna lose is love

Through my eyes, time goes by like tears
My emotion's losing the color of life
Kill my heart, release all my pain
I'm shouting out louder
Insanity takes hold over me

Turning away from the wall
Nothing I can see
The scream deep inside
Reflecting another person in my heart
He calls me from within
""All existence you see before you must be wiped out:
Dream, Reality, Memories, and Yourself""

I begin to lose control of myself
My lust is so blind, destroys my mind
Nobody can stop my turning to madness
No matter how you try to hold me in your heart
Why do you wanna raise these walls?
I don't know the meaning of hatred
My brain gets blown away hearing words of lies
I only want to hold your love

Stab the dolls filled with hate
Wash yourself with their blood
Drive into the raging current of time
Swing your murderous weapon into the belly
""the earth""
Shout and start creating confusion
Shed your blood for pleasure
And what? For love?
What am I supposed to do?

I believe in the madness called ""Now""
Past and future prison my heart
Time is blind, but I wanna trace my love
On the wall of time over pain in my heart
Art of life, insane blade stabbing dreams
Try to break all truth now
But I can't heal this broken heart in pain
Cannot start to live, cannot end my life
Keep on cry

(Close my eyes) Time breathes I can hear
All love and sadness melt in my heart
Dry my tears, wipe my bloody face
I wanna feel me living my life outside my walls

[Spoken Interlude]
You can't draw a picture of yesterday, so you're painting your heart with your blood. You can't say ""No,"" only turning the wheel of time with a rope around your neck. You build a wall of morality and take a breath from between the bricks. You make up imaginary enemies and are chased by them. You're trying to commit suicide. You're satisfied with your prologue. Now you're painting your first chapter black. You are putting the scraps of life together and trying to make an asylum for yourself. You're hitting a bell at the edge of the stage. And you are trying to kill me

I believe in the madness called ""Now""
Time goes flowing, breaking my heart
Wanna live, can't let my heart kill myself
Still I haven't found what I'm looking for
Art of life, I try to stop myself
But my heart goes to destroy the truth
Tell me why, I want the meaning of my life
Do I try to live? Do I try to love in my dream?

[2nd Movement]
[Piano Solo]

[3rd Movement]
I'm breaking the wall inside my heart
I just wanna let my emotions get out
Nobody can stop my running to freedom
No matter how you try to hold me in your world
Like a doll carried by the flow of time
I sacrificed the present moment for the future
I was in chains of memory half-blinded
Losing my heart, walking in the sea of dreams

Close my eyes, rose breathes I can hear
All love and sadness melt in my heart
Dry my tears, wipe my bloody face
I wanna feel me living my life outside my mind

Dreams can make me mad
I can't leave my dream
I can't stop myself
Don't know what I am
What lies are truth? What truths are lies?

I believe in the madness called ""Now""
Time goes flowing, breaking my heart
Wanna live, can't let my heart kill myself
Still I haven't found what I'm looking for
Art of life, I try to stop myself
But my heart goes to destroy the truth
Tell me why, I want the meaning of my life
Do I try to live? Do I try to love?

Art of life, an Eternal Bleeding heart
You never wanna breathe your last
Wanna live, can't let my heart kill myself
Still I'm feeling for a rose is breathing love

Who stayed the course, who held firm
I don't know what to say, nigga, I don't know what to say

Man, what can I say?
I was just another nigga from the town
Tryin' to find a way to get paid
Man, what can I say? (What?)
Big body, 100 thousand dollar car
I pull up in new one, every day
Man, what can I say?
I'm getting too much cake for a safe
Made way more money than mistakes
Man, what can I say?
Went from a young nigga to a whole great
All in a day's work
Man, what can I say?

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Maybe, I should start with my first point
Started out selling weed in the shake joint
I went from nothing to playing on a world tour
What else could a Bankhead nigga ask for?
I will respect a hustle if you earn from it
A mistakes worth makin' if you can learn from it
I knew the sun was for sure coming
When a nigga called himself a killer but they nosey as an old woman
We had a problem, we just stole on him
And nowadays niggas found a way but no one told on 'em
He got a dub, hope they give him some parole on it
Everything glitter ain't got gold on it
Okay, now, everybody know that we don't play around
That boy be pillow-talking, beware, what you say around him
And Vera Wang and McQueen, I got nice things
Started serving these suckers 'round nineteen
I don't give a damn 'bout what you think you might seen
Look, you better clean your eyes, get some Visine
What can I say that you have not seen
Been on a cannonball run at the bag going high speed
Stop at nothing if you're out for somethin'
And my momma couch stuffed with stacks of hundreds
Safe deposit box, it's for my childrens' colleges
If you ever start a business, you won't go to college

Sad when you found out I hit her

I promise, it don't get no realer
Forever, been a stand up nigga

Walk it how you talk it, play it how it go
Learn to peep a fuck nigga with your eyes closed
Learn to turn your neighborhood from a eye sore
The real-estate people wanna come and buy more
In the trap, with a trap door
If the task force come, I'll be gone before you open that door
Gold bar buy 'em off shore
Well, you can save yourself some money on the taxes but it cost more (What?)
Lawyer doing deals on the golf course
You catch a charge, they can get it tossed for you
Throw it out, nevermind what the outcome is
You're missing game, how you listen with your mouth running
I done forever had the South running
Went to New York and hollered Bankhead, they respect where I'm comin'
From, I don't give a damn, give me my money
The country niggas over there, shawty, I'm a southern
Don't let nobody give you nothin' you ain't earn from 'em
'Less you finessing for some bags and you swerve on 'em
Forever kickin' shit, you'd think a turd on me
How you come out your fuckin' face? You got some nerve, homie
I'm only living for the rare moment
Like the time you deliver for your kid, with your word on it
When you the king and your reputation stay clean even when they try to throw dirt on it

[Chorus: T.I.]
Man, what can I say?
I was just another nigga from the town
Tryin' to find a way to get paid
Man, what can I say? (What?)
Big body, 100 thousand dollar car
I pull up in new one, every day
Man, what can I say?
I'm getting too much cake for safe
Made way more money than a mistake
Man, what can I say?
Went from a young nigga to a whole great
All in a day's work
Man, what can I say?

[Post-Chorus: T.I.]
You can't talk to me, homie, I suggest you send your boss to me, homie
Man, what can I say?
In the Dawn with the top down on it, ducking suckers tryna block my moment
Man, what can I say?
And you gon' be mad when I get her
Sad when you found out I hit her
Man, what can I say?
I promise, it don't get no realer
Forever, been a stand up nigga
Man, what can I say?",T.I.,1977,"[98, 55, 53, 48, 49, 49, 42, 42]",8

498,I Never Cry,"If there is a tear on my face
It makes me shiver to the bone
It shakes me, Babe
It's just a heartache that got caught in my eye
And you know I never cry, I never cry

Sometimes I drink more than I need
Until the TV's dead and gone
I may be lonely
But I'm never alone
And the night may pass me by
But I'll never cry

Take away, take away my eyes
Sometimes I'd rather be blind
Break a heart, break a heart of stone
Open it up but don't you leave it alone

'Cuz that's all I got to give you
Believe me Babe, it ain't been used
My heart's a virgin, its never been tried
And you know I'll never cry
And you know I'll never cry
And you know I'll never cry
Never cry, I'll never cry

Break a heart, break a heart of stone
Open it up but don't leave, don't you leave me alone
'Cuz that's all I got to give you
Believe me Babe, it ain't been used
My heart's a virgin, it ain't never been tried

499,Someone To Lay Down Beside Me,"[Verse 1]
There's somebody waiting alone in the street
For someone to walk up and greet
Here you are all alone in the city
Where's the one that you took to your side?
Lonely faces will stare through your eyes in the night

[Verse 2]
And they'll say
Woman, sweet woman, please come home with me
You're shining and willing and free
But your love, it's a common occurrence
Not like love that I feel in my heart
Still, you know that may be what I need

[Chorus]
Is someone to lay down beside me
And even though it's not real
Just someone to lay down beside me
You're the story of my life

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
Just someone to lay down beside me
And even though it's not real
Just someone to lay down beside me
You're the story of my life

[Verse 3]
Well morning is breaking, the street lights are off
The sun will soon share all the cost
Of a world that can be sort of heartless
Not like love that you feel in your heart
Still, you know that may be all you get

Is someone to lay down beside you
And even though it's not real
Just someone to lay down beside you
You just can't ask for more",Karla Bonoff,1977,"[58, 52, 46, 42, 44, 44, 46]",7

501,Hey Baby,"[Verse 1: Stephen Marley]
I've been gone awhile away from you
And I hope you overstand
That I've got to do what I must do to be a better man
Cause if I was just to act a fool do nothing with myself
Then all my blessings would be cursed my world would crumble in
It's a joy when I sit down and think of the good times that we have
And what we do to make it through when the good turns to the bad
Well I hope you find it in your heart and know these words are true
And please don't fuss because I must go do what I must do

Hey baby don't you worry, even though the road is rocky
I'll be coming home to you again
And if you thought that I was lost, I have to bear my cross
Now I'm free from all these chains

[Verse 2: Stephen Marley]
A time, a space, a different place, how perfect we might be
I would be the wind that blows you'd be that willow tree
And I could never bare the thought of you not by my side
So I would be the warmth of day you'd be the cool of night
And everyday I pray to Jah that one day you will see
And overstand the fact I must fulfill my destiny
I hope you find it in your heart and know these words are true
And please don't cry you know I must do what I must do

[Hook: Stephen Marley]
Hey baby don't you worry, even though the road is rocky
I'll be coming home to you again

Well and it's not easy, Jah knows how I try I try
So don't you get weary (Oh God)
Jah knows how I try, I try

[Verse 3: Mos Def]
And God knows, that life is one big road
With a lot of signs and turns and twist and curves
Even though the road is rocky
But maintain to ride and keep on rockin
From, city to city backyard to yard
And we, be seein the sites standin under the lights
And the spot is hot it's cold and lonely at nights
And I'm feenin and I'm dreamin and I'm holdin you tight
But hold on, every single road I rode on
Come to an end and I'm back home again
So baby please don't cry
It's no valley low and it's no mountain high
And our love don't die with the passage of time
It just grow more, it just keep strong
And even though I'm gone I ain't never too far
Your the light through the dark shining right through my heart
So my journey must start

Hey baby don't you worry, even though the road is rocky
I'll be coming home to you again
And if you thought that I was lost, I have to bear my cross

Hail, hail rock and roll
Hail, hail rock and roll

We'd be twisting like a piston in our daddy's car
Trying hard to keep it under control
And when we didn't have gas money and we couldn't go far
We'd either walk or we'd do the stroll
Everybody say hail, hail, everybody
Hail, hail rock and roll
Hail, hail rock and roll

Maybe we can go downtown
I'll teach you things you never learned in school
I got an A in chugging but my major is hugging
And I really think you're cool

Little darlin', breaking up is hard to do
But making up is so much fun
When you do it to the music by the light of the moon

507,Spend Some Time,"[Intro: Eminem]
If there's any bitches in this room
Then there's somethin' I gotta say (Say)
For all the fools who fell for the first
Girl who comes their way
I've been down that road, and now I'm back
Sittin' on square one
Tryin' to pick myself up
Where I started from

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
I never would've thought that I'd see you out of control
Even though my penis was deep down in your hole
You should know, between us, we was like mates of soul
Nothin' could intervene us, especially no hoes
You was more so the chalant type I chose
'Til more shows, haunted you nights, I suppose
That's how it go: with time spent, emotion grows
In the beginning friends, we decided to roll
So who's responsible when you get excited, explode
And Obie's grinnin', then you invite that Obie's cold?
But bitches, they gon' talk; niggas, they gon' hate
We established this way before we became mates
So what's required is that you chill with all that fire
Get your desire when I retire, and—

[Hook: Dina Rae & Eminem]
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (Ha-ha)
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, ‘cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I used to say I never met a girl like you before
Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are
Almost went as far as introducin' you to my daughters
'Til you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
If you recall, I used to treat you like a groupie broad
When we fucked, I refused to even take my jewelry off
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off
It was a shock, it struck me as odd, but it turned me on
You started gettin' moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
And who'da even knew that? Who would'a even thought possibly
Cupid could shoot another one of them Goddamn darts at me?
It's true that I got shot in the heart, but when someone seems
Too good to be true, they usually are, but see
When you're in it, it's too hard to see
'Til you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach
Up under the seat as your heart starts to beat
Before you make a decision that's life-altering
And just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave
You hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring

[Hook: Dina Rae & Eminem]
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (Ha-ha)
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, ‘cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (Ha-ha)

[Interlude: Stat Quo]
Ha, ha, yeah right, bitch
Spend some time on my dick

[Verse 3: Stat Quo]
In most cases, Stat's attitude is, ""Fuck a bitch!"" (Fuck a bitch!)
My only motive is to get head, and fuck a bitch (Fuck a bitch!)
But you was different, thought we shared a covenant
Even held your hand in pub-a-lic
We sufferin' because of this (Because of this)
Shawty on some whole 'nother other shit (Other shit)
Tryin' to play slick, thinkin' I'ma trick off grip
I'll admit, I was caught in the mix, down to commit
Feedin' you the best of me, I should've fed you piss (Should've fed you piss)
We started off closer than close
But who could've predicted to know
Your trifling ways would'a stopped our growth?
And the final result, back in that same boat
I asked myself: ""Do I love these hoes?"" — Nope!

[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
(Yeah) Em introduced us: ""50, this is Tanya, Tanya, this is 50""
Then slid off and left her to kick it with me
I complimented her, I said, ""You have very nice lips.""
With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick
We played the phone game, a week later, shit changed fast
Had her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass
Downtown Manhattan, on the balcony, stare at the skyline
Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind
She got to talkin', talkin' like an opportunist, too
Why talk, when suckin' my dick is the real career move?
Said she's an aspiring actress, she do videos for practice
Yeah, yeah, know how many times I done heard that shit? (Ha-ha!)

When she asked me if I wanted cream

Its not a bad life on the road
If youve got wheels to roll
And lucky stars above
Your destinys your own
You go as far as you can go
And if theres time to sleep
Theres time to make love

I came, I saw, I conquered
But I rode off in the sun
But I know the look she left with me
Keeps telling me she won
Her face is the only thing I see
Whispering those words of prophesy

I may come easy, but I dont come free
Youre never gonna see the last of me

513,Up Your Nose,"One fine day as I was walking down the street
I spied a beggar man with rags upon his feet
Took a penny from my pocket in his tin cup I did drop it
And I heard him say as I made my retreat

May the bird of paradise fly up your nose
May an elephant caress you with it's toes
May your wife be plagued with runners in her hose
May the bird of paradise fly up your nose

My laundry man is really on his toes
Found a hundred dollar bill among my clothes
When he called me I came running
Gave him back his dime for phoning
And I heard him saying as I turned to go

May the bird of paradise fly up your nose
May an elephant caress you with it's toes
May your wife be plagued with runners in her hose
May the bird of paradise fly up your nose

I was way behind one day to catch a train
The taxi driver said we'll make it just the same
A speed cop made it with us and as he wrote out the ticket
I stood by politely waitin' for my change

May the bird of paradise fly up your nose
May an elephant caress you with it's toes
May your wife be plagued with runners in her hose
May the bird of paradise fly up your nose",Ernest Tubb,1977,"[91, 92, 100]",3
514,Muskrat Love,"Muskrat, muskrat candlelight
Doing the town and doing it right
In the evening
It's pretty pleasing

Muskrat Susie, Muskrat Sam
Do the jitterbug out in muskrat land
And they shimmy
And Sammy's so skinny

And they whirled and they twirled and they tangoed
Singing and jinging the jango
Floating like the heavens above
Looks like muskrat love

Nibbling on bacon, chewing on cheese
Sammy says to Susie, ""honey, would you please
Be my missus?""
And she says yes with her kisses

And now he's tickling her fancy, rubbing her toes
Muzzle to muzzle, now anything goes
As they wriggle
And Sue starts to giggle

And they whirled and they twirled and they tangoed
Singing and jinging the jango
Floating like the heavens above
Looks like muskrat love",America,1977,"[97, 51, 45, 32, 21, 16]",6
515,Turn Loose Of My Leg,"These girls today they sure act funny
Take you out and spend their money
But they always seem to expect a favor or two
A girl picked me up about a week ago
Drug me out to some drive-in show
Oh,I can't begin to say what she put me through
She parked me on the very last row
Reached down and grabbed my knee
My whole life flashed before my eyes
I said this can't be happining to me

Chorus

Turn loose of my leg
I don't know you that well
Turn loose of my leg
In love with you I have not fell
I know what you are
Just forget it and remove your hand
Turn loose of my leg
I'm not that kind of man

The other day I was at the soda shop
Had an ice cream sundae and a soda pop
The waitress brought me a note from a woman in a booth
The note said join me for another round
And I'll pick up your check and show you the town
I can't begin to say what she put me through
Underneath that table her fingers did the walkin'
Till she touched the tip of my shoe
I ran for the door but she wouldn't let go
I must a drug her for a block or two

Turn loose of my leg
You don't seem to understand
I'm not that kind of man
You want to hug me and hold me
And kiss me on the mouth
You make me want to crawl the walls
When your hands start flying south

About my steam like a percolator, hurdle over hurtful haters
Murder players, burgle freighters, perpetual perpetrator
Purple flavored herbal vapors flexing in a thermal blazer

My shit is hotter than a middle eastern climate, violent
I'm immature, i avoid responsibility like pontious pilate

I don't eat pieces of shit for breakfast, the food pantry don't got those
I try my best, but ended up with minimum wage at mcdonalds
Goddamn i miss my dead friend, shout out to laura
I'm in these streets but it's a dead end, wear a mask like majora

I'll always return the favour and eat her pussy out!

It's about both of us feeling happy.. and having a good time...
You know, I just want everyone to have a good time

She's touchin on the dick like nixon's mortician

I'm a sadboy unironically but fuck it, happy rappy

People think they really being helpful
By telling me please be careful, yeah right
R-r-right, r-right, r-right, right, right
Please, please don't play this song

[Verse 1]
Pain, hurt, sadness and loneliness
Balled all that shit right up
Tossed it away to the bottomless pit
The part of my mind that slips
And the part of my mind so sick
I don't even like to take the trip unless I'm sloppy drunk
I pray for my mom, how to teach a son
That never gave a fuck about a scantron?
All I wanted was to be a human being
And show all the world some new colors and scenes
Imagine all types of beautiful scenery
I remember when I first had trees
Smoked out a Black and Mild, so dumb of me
Now, I'm grape Cigarillo man
Any young black kid, guaranteed fan
Hold it down, humble pie on the humble
And I treat normal girls like models
Reckless and young and my, my mom's calling
Think I should hit decline
I'm numb faced while I'm thinking 'bout suicide

The blogs tell it; ""Cudi's lame
Wearing a kilt? He must be gay.""
Let's keep it trill, fuck being discreet
Bet some girls tweet how they miss my meat
Yeah, Cudders, HBO, that Vitamin Water
That's money to blow 'cause it's money for blow
Don't take no shit, you can blame my ma

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now if we jump together, at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Bridge]
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go

[Pre-Chorus]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
Even though I might not like this
I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute (Only for a minute)
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me (Right to me)
I wanna raise your spirits (Wanna raise your spirits)
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

523,Fly By Night/In The Mood,"Prologue:
""Airport scurry flurry faces
Parade of passers by
People going many places
With a smile or just a sigh
Waiting waiting pass the time
Another cigarette
Get in line - gate thirty-nine
The time is not here yet..... ""

Why try? I know why
The feeling inside me says it's time I was gone
Clear head, new life ahead
I want to be king now not just one more pawn

Chorus:
Fly by night, away from here
Change my life again
Fly by night goodbye my dear
My ship isn't coming and I just can't pretend

Moon rise, thoughtful eyes
Staring back at me from the window beside
No fright or hindsight
Leaving behind that empty feeling inside

Start a new chapter
Find what I'm after
It's changing every day
The change of a season
Is enough of a reason
To want to get away

The other part:
Quiet and pensive
My thoughts apprehensive
The hours drift away
Leaving my homeland
Playing a lone hand
My life begins today",Rush,1977,"[88, 92, 98, 98]",4
524,Love Ballad,"[Verse 1]
I
Have never been so much
In love
Before
What a difference a true love made in my life
So nice
So right

[Chorus]
Loving you gave me something new
That I'd never felt, never dreamed of
Something's changed
No, it's not the feeling I had before
Oh-oh-oh, it's much, much more

[Verse 2]
Love
I never knew that a touch
Could mean
So much
What a difference
And when we walk hand-in-hand
I feel
So real

[Chorus]
Lovers come and then lovers go
That's what folks will say
Don't they know?
They're not there when you love me
Hold me and say you care

[Coda]
And what we have is much more than they could see
(Well, well, well, well, there's so much more now)
What we have is much more than they could see
(Well, well-e-ell, there's so much more, baby)
What we have is much more than they could see
(Well, there's so much, so much more)
What we have is much more than they could see

526,More Than A Feeling,"[Verse 1]
I looked out this morning and the sun was gone
Turned on some music to start my day
I lost myself in a familiar song
I closed my eyes and I slipped away

[Chorus]
It's more than a feeling (more than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play (more than a feeling)
I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)
'Till I see Marianne walk away
I see my Marianne walkin' away

[Verse 2]
So many people have come and gone
Their faces fade as the years go by
Yet I still recall as I wander on
As clear as the sun in the summer sky

[Chorus]
It's more than a feeling (more than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play (more than a feeling)
I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)
'Till I see Marianne walk away
I see my Marianne walkin' away

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
When I'm tired and thinking cold
I hide in my music, forget the day
And dream of a girl I used to know
I closed my eyes and she slipped away

She slipped away

It's more than a feeling (more than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play (more than a feeling)
I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)

If I leave here tomorrow
Would you still remember me?
For I must be traveling on, now

Bye, bye, baby, it's been a sweet love
Though this feeling I can't change
But please don't take it so badly

Things just couldn't be the same
Cause I'm as free as a bird now

533,Beth/Detroit Rock City,"[Round 1: Tsu Surf]
First thing I hear when I touch down is “Surf, the Midwest groovin'
Such and such nice, what’s his name doin' his numbers
And I don’t see the Midwest losin'.”
Well, I could think of a few verbs, for the niggas that think they ill
I come through the Midwest cruisin'
X all factors, hit all men tryna holla—
Ayy, Hitman, let me holla at you
I brought enough for you and ShowwOutt
And anybody that show out
Already got my other half, I’ll clear this fuckin' show out
'Bout to get this nigga dressed, no he ain’t about to go out
I need that old Hitman, tank top with the rope out
Yett Yett, what? This 60's shit is somethin' you don’t know 'bout
You said you wanted to ride… well, Gerald let’s roll out
Me and my strap got two different visions, but I see hands so clear
Mines goin' out blazin', clips droppin', no fear
Look like a car crash, he get the bag, no air
That tre see morgue and he don’t wanna go there
They say Tsu Surf cold but all he talk about is hoopin’
‘Cause I feel like I’m shootin' when I squirt pounds
And as long as them cans is close, his wig in by the first round
If it’s hard, but not real, I don’t care about ya bar
He get two to the chest; I slid up on duke and drew with finesse
My big homie told me how them streets play out is wild
That mean if this mark is smart he’ll stay out the crowd
How you average 26.6, moonwalk on skates
AND clap heat? You are not a shooter
Feet, hand, sticks: Amadou ya, that’s how I’ma do you
Raised in that croc pool, send some piranhas to ya
Lift the Hitman up to God, can I get a ""Hallelujah""?
I’m always reachin' ‘cause a paranoia trip's way better than nervous
Chilled against Charlie but still here
I think I handled that Clip better than Curtis
So Hitman will front, and ShowwOutt is back?
Boy, I make Hitman front show out his back
Fuck Cable, this could happen on demand, it’s go time
Was on the net flickin' through your music, got bored in no time
How much you weighin', brother?
It don’t really matter when it’s yo' time
I send him MAC's, he pay per round – Verb, it’s showtime
And every single nigga you see me with, I clap for him
Gotta give him six, man, can he?
Better pray Antoine come back for ‘em
They say Surf reach a lot, maybe 'cause Surf reach a lot
This new Cal I’m buyin' stupid, period, I’ll teach a block
Columbine, period, teacher, block…
This gun talk 101, I can teach a block
I don’t know about you, but I ain’t tryna get shot for shit
It became so normal, I reach when I ain’t got the shit
I ain’t a Proving Ground nigga, this ain't proven ground, nigga
Been gettin' a million views, what you provin' now, nigga?
Jersey!

[Round 1: Hitman Holla]
Besides the fact you got killed in your last war
You said you want that Hitman with that rope chain and that tank top? Be careful what you ask for
Fuck you and any nigga that co-sign him!
Man, I’ll hold your daughter over the boat
Like, “Surf your daddy?” (“Yeah?”) “Well, go find him!”
It’s a wrap now, two big 40's and a MAC round
The Shotgun I brought do way more than a pat down
You crippin'? I roll with B's
You talkin' all that basketball shit
'Til I Eurostep with the switchblade and X him over C's
Me lose tonight? No fuckin' way
Smack, do not call time, ‘cause I got a lot of shit I gotta fuckin' say
Example: I made my own name, my nigga, I was in top form
I came to the stage, the people they got they popcorn
They call you Tsu Surf ‘cause you waited on a Loaded Lux co-sign wave and hopped on – that’s bitch shit
Ridin' a nigga dick – that's some sissy shit
Well, I’m strapped in your neighborhood with two 30's
Let’s see if y’all really about that 60’s shit
Honestly, fuck who came with you tonight, y’all all lunch
I got a brand new black MAK-90 with no rubber grip
That’s for the raw bunch
You seen what I did to Ars and Red? This your way to learn
Man, I done hung up more Jersey niggas than David Stern
I’m pissed and I’m not in the mood, don’t talk slick to me
I’m gifted, I win off presence: no Christmas tree
I’m way too much, to win you need a glitch from me
I’m Stevie Wonder: subtitles don’t mean shit to me
Y’all praise him for gettin' booked for possession?
I’m finna say, what, y’all happy he floss with it?
‘Cause where I’m from we praise the shooters
Not the niggas that get caught with it
Man, I’m undefeated with a weapon… shit, I’m a boss, nigga
And it’s loaded, fuck Lux!, this Calico ain’t lost, nigga
My boys in the hood, I brought plenty convicts
And death is the answer to any conflict
You brought Suge, I’m like, “Why? That nigga’s a bitch!”
We ain’t seen Shotgun put in work since Ricky got hit
Fuck peace, I like the streets, shots and sirens
Whole hood got jobs ‘cause the block is hirin'
Potato on the deadbeat: that mean the pop is silent
Me and my niggas’ll walk through your neighborhood
Like we tryna stop the violence
Chill ‘fore I flash one, remix that blast, son
“Holla, let me get him!” – nah, you fucked up my last one
I’m thinkin' about shootin' a nigga, pull that beam out
Shots go right through his chest, rip his spleen out
The doctors pull his dreams out, his mama—
“Fuck that, Holla, I’ll knock him clean out!”
Say it again? Fuck it, I’ma remix it
Chill ‘fore I flash one, remix that blast, son
“Holla let me get him!” – nah, you fucked up my last one
“Holla let me get him!” – nah, you fucked up my last one
I’m thinkin' about shootin' a nigga, pull that beam out
Shots go right through his chest, rip his spleen out
Shots shots shots go right through his chest
Rip his spleen out, the doctors pull his dreams out
His mama— “Fuck that, Holla— fuck that, Holla—
Fuck that, Holla, I’ll knock him clean out!!!”
They ask why always use ShowwOutt as a prop
Be-motherfucking-cause
That nigga ain’t a prop, that’s my motherfuckin' blood
Big Gerald raised us on that motherfuckin' belt
And said, ""Fuck a fair fight, that other brother better help!""
Speakin' of fight, y’all thought that scuffle was fake and I hate that
It wasn’t a big deal for real, y’all made it that
Well, I’m callin' niggas’ bluff, Surf, let’s have a cage match
Can’t nobody leave 'til a nigga dead: stage that
Whole bunch of mics on his head: I parade that
Uppercut and swing like an Atlanta Brave cat
Tay Roc, keep my motherfuckin' name out your mouth
Lil nigga, I’ll expose you
If you need help just say you need help, I’ll mold you
It’s either that or get a casket bed, they’ll close you
His bitch will have to open the box to see Roc like a proposal
Anybody takin' bets, shit, where the bets, clowns?
I’ma let you in on a hint, this ain’t even my best round
What’s big money to small change?!
Two words after this: BALL GAME!

[Round 2: Tsu Surf]
See, that’s where I can agree with you
That nigga from B-more, sometimes I wanna clothesline him
Dump him somewhere and let somebody nobody knows find him
Cops and the dog, y’all wake me up when those find him
Tay get a tombstone, you see 'Roc' on the rock like Hov signed him
Okay, I got caught with a strap, fuck it, I did a bid with it
Thank God they caught him for possession
And they ain’t catch him for what he did with it
I’m wherever Yett Yett at, strap out, it ain’t in the tuck
You might have a Calico loaded with hollows
So a good six rounds could just be beginner’s luck
I came to murder somethin'
I mean you got a few wins, yeah, that could be true
But I also know ShowwOutt got just as many wins as you
I can’t be mad at ShowwOutt, but if you take Show out
Nobody that catch the gun will catch you
Somebody tell me what this show 'bout
What you gon' do? Slide up on me like baggage claim?
Re-remix then clap me up kill?
Wait a minute, your lil brother took the tab on that Bill
If I could reload with the same bullets that I shot with
I’m about to stuff these Mossberg shells in this Glock clip
Queen Latifah ""Set It Off"" mask, jump in the 380
Cops catch him, fuck it, it was ugly, he could plead crazy
Lock pick the door, “Errrrhhh!!” they sleep, baby
See his son, “BAH!” I'll G Baby G baby
What, I need to remix it or somethin'? Nah, I won’t
Slide Smack a stack to get it in the building, you ain’t gettin' far
Fuck I gotta put it in subtitles? You ain’t get the bar?
Nigga, you can’t read, it ain’t in the car
""This brand new Nina, who gon' take one for the team?""
That was mean, hella body
But this pump like a jump: that bitch down to hit everybody
With a ladder long clip, that’s for when we ride though
That’s your lil man? When we catch him he dyin', bro
Hit him with a 60 second clip to the slide Show
I got double 9's, my mans got double 9's, we’ll shake shit
I’ll let a round off from this semi tuck, that’s a great flip
He let a round off from that semi tuck, another great flip
Boy, we’ll put two and two together like it make sense
When was your last body?
Phara and Shooney? That shit bored me
Only time I’m comin' at two bitches is in an orgy
I just cop some new bullets, I call 'em edibles
Is he a G? No, a Smith in his back will be terrible
My logic is, if I send 100 shots he can’t duck 'em all
Clip of hot peppers: Holla, I’ll pin yo' head to the fuckin' wall
And if I gotta ride or somethin', all black disguise or somethin'
Timbos, cargos, mask with a 9 or somethin'
You gon' need God, hidin' tips from Saddam or somethin'
Mike Brown: that boy gon' die for nothin'

[Round 2: Hitman Holla]
You asked when’s the last time I bodied
Phara and Shooney? When the last time you bodied a nigga?
That nigga from the S.O.N.S.? Stop, y’all need to quit
D boys the only niggas that brag about gettin' rid of bricks
You had a classic vers’ Shine, but he ain’t really shit
You shined vers’ X, but that was really it
My right hand man will shoot you, then plead the fifth
But why? When I can give my own shot like I ain’t need the pick
My homie said “Who?” I said “All,” I ain’t need to pick
The scope, I went right through the screen
Like I ain’t need the switch
Fresh out of retirement, yeah, they don’t like that
.45, bald head, they yelling ""Mike back!""
King of performance, yeah, they yelling ""Mike back!""
Worldstar TKO’s, they yelling ""Mike back!""
Kill one of mine, that’s cool, I’m comin' right back
And kill two of yours and make you come get a life back
That Internet beef you be on will get your wife snatched
That money Smack gave you tonight will get your wife back
So what if I’m whoopin' yo' ass, Surf… (Fight back!)
You be sleepin' on Budden couch like that’s your father
Well, what’s all that rappin' for?
What’s all that kidnappin' niggas for bricks and all that trappin' for?
Man, stop, I’ll clap the 4
Kill Surf, he gon' have to bury his son: I’ll Jackson Joe
Man, what time your girl get off? We in that van waitin'
We all in the front yard like we landscapin'
We all in your living room with the cans blazin'
Boo bop, bop bop bop bop!
Ain’t Red your man? Just tell him give you that translation!
I watched Goodz big boy you
What kind of star lets another nigga tell him go run a pack?
What, you ain’t have them gadgets blitty?
Well, it’s gon' be perfection how this KOD
If Tsu’s ever in me or Magic's city
Oh, y’all ain’t catch that? This Jersey girl gettin' zipped up
In other words, I got that metal on stage like a strip club
Random: but Suge so fuckin' terrible
I coulda beat both of y’all, same night
If they was on stage measurin' hearts
Me and Suge would be the same height
Or Tsu Surf’s gon be a watery death, broad day, plain sight
His momma gon have to wear a bathing suit
And scuba gear to visit the grave site
If I use this heavy metal
Y’all gon have the crowd Surf and ‘em in the ambulance
Fuck, y’all waitin' on that subtitle or somethin'?
I said if I use this heavy metal
Y’all gon have to crowd surf him to the ambulance
Fuck, y’all waitin' to remix that subtitle or somethin'?
I said if I use this heavy metal
Y’all gon' have to crowd surf him to the…
Crowd surf him to the… crowd surf him to the ambulance
I’m just tryna get on the same page as you
How Arsonal and Red left you booked? Shotgun made you ride solo? And these the niggas that’s on stage with you?!
That wasn’t played well, ‘cause I guarantee
If that was me… Magic, Ill and Verb woulda spent every goddamn night in Detroit until I made bail
It was four of them, one pistol – you was gon' raise hell?
If it’s four of us it’s four pistols
We woulda all had to sit in that same cell
But now it’s “hee-hee-haa-haa,” man, that’s weak shit
And how ironic that this college nigga
Whippin' this hood nigga on some street shit
I mean, I could talk about how you be reach—
I’ma save that for round three, bitch! BALL GAME!

[Round 3: Tsu Surf]
I hear everything you sayin', but let’s discuss somethin' that’s apparent… Hitman Holla, cold killa!
But Gerald Fulton grew up with both parents
Now, I’m not knockin' havin' both parents
But your situation wasn’t the worst
Like, everything Mommy ain’t have on the 15th
Daddy could cover on the 1st
He probably taught you that 5 step drop back
And that spiral almost amazingly
I taught myself you gotta ease off that trigger slow
Let that hammer up simultaneously
He probably taught you about the birds and the bees
Chlamydia, clap and all about crabs
Man, them niggas was out the window with the bird
Throwin' out B’s, clappin', callin' out “Crabs!”
You was at practice shootin', if you missed you'd do suicides
Them niggas came through shootin'
That was our practice; if we missed, that was suicide
Every time I feel some type of way about my hood
These family niggas be remindin' me
See, we both real niggas, but you a different kind to me
Math, English, lunch – you was on a different time than me
I pull up: gym, I pull out: trigonometry
You had X squared over Y
Tryna find the remainder, then add up
I’m askin' my ex, “Why
You askin' me about numbers? I’m tryna bag up.”
Your father probably bought your mother coat
All your sports gear and your brother boots
No football, these gloves wasn’t for baseball
This face mask was for other use
Your mother was at the game, cardboard colors, fresh signs
My mother was in pain
""You wanna speak to the inmate, press 9.""
You get off the court, woo! Daddy right there
“Congratulations you did it.” – I won’t say I’m jealous
But me and Mommy had to wait to Wednesday to kick it
I know you won’t get it
Shit, I have flashbacks when I spit it
But Wednesday and Thursday, that was assigned visits
I just feel like Big Gerald John Witherspoon and you Craig
What you doin' with that Glock?
I mean, back on the West Side
They ain’t have guns, we had these to rock
I admit if I was in his position I probably woulda stopped
We got so much in common: both protected by them pops
Moral of the story, all that fuckin' school and you ain’t learn shit
Put him in my hood one time, boy, and you’ll turn bitch
If Verb woulda holla’d for my father… he wouldn’t have heard shit!
If you say you was wrestlin' in the streets
You a Stone Cold Stunner, you was home with your mother
Watchin' wrestling: Rock, Raw, Chyna, Smackdown
We was in the trap house: raw, rock, china gettin' smacked down
Jersey!

[Round 3: Hitman Holla]
New Jersey was like the Celtics at one point in time
Y’all had the Big 4: KG, Paul Pierce, Ray Allen and Rondo
But y’all all split up and started fallin' off
It was only a matter of time though
I see y’all lookin' like, ""Well, who’s who?""
Ars, he was once MVP, so that’s KG
That’s just right off the hunch, O-Red = Ray Allen
‘Cause he probably the deadliest shooter out of the bunch
Won’t y’all help me think of somebody for Suge? ‘Cause I’m tryin'
I mean I could call Shotgun “The Truth,” but I’d be lyin'
And Surf, you Rondo, not ‘cause you be runnin' shit
It’s ‘cause your first name Rajon, let’s bring that back
Us, them, it ain’t hard to figure out who the ops
Hitman vs Arsonal, I got rid of that big ticket like I knew the cop
After that battle they looked at St. Louis and believed us
Hitman vs O-Red: I called him Ray Allen
‘Cause I sent that nigga to Jesus
Hitman vs Shotgun Suge, I’ma need a serious check
So that just leave Surf, yet and still he ain’t a serious threat
‘Cause I’m appalled how
Rajon ain’t been on point since his parents left
Everything from AR’s to Glocks in his face
Chinese choppers, they sound different
You could tell they not from the States
“Brackow! Brackow,” shit that’ll make Barack leave the States
My city got me paranoid, so I’m shootin' at any cop on the chase
And if Qua jump in, he get it the same way
I killed his dog, now me and Calicoe fightin' the same case
We two different Rugrats
‘Cause you a rat and you tell what you seen for a hobby
I’m Angelica, that’s ‘cause I get mean with the Tommy
Y’all remember that Michael Jackson Motown glove?
Well, I use that to clean up the shotty, and left it on the scene
Cops thought a nigga Billie Jean’d at the homi
""You are in the middle of that *CH-CH*: that’s CHURCH""
I mean, before y’all say I’m hatin'
Just explain to me, what 'church' had to do with that situation?
Then you had the nerve to say
“I’m too advance for these niggas, and it hurts.”
No, you just reach too fuckin' much and they let it work
Well, since they let you get away with it
Let me try it, and I’ma do it worse
Check, code name San Fran, that’s forty 9's, and when it burst
You are in the middle of that SF: that’s SURF
I see you over there lookin' like, “That last shit ain’t hit like that?”
But you woulda screamed and went crazy
When he say shit like that
I got them things like Tambourines, we clap at whoever
I treat your block like a URL card and smack it together
They found his body so distorted he was backwards together
Me and ShowwOutt the male version of Serena and Venus
Same parents but we swing ratchets together
I got some shit that’ll flip a nigga, he’ll tumble on the spot
I don’t even drink, but I took some shots
Then I stumbled to his pops
I’m like, “I brought them Nick Cannons
You know? Braataa Braataa, Brrrrrrrr-POP!”
Man, I be feelin' like a Piston in Detroit
When I’m drummin' on the block
You either gon' respect me or respect me, ain’t no in and out
Stay in your lane, don’t cross over like an in-an-out
It’s real where I’m from, you playin', you took the scrimmage route
It’s all fun 'til you layin' with your ligaments out
Surf, I’m a beast, peep, I bring extenders out
A star that’ll play with them birds: I took the Emmitt route

See the people who stop and stare and say
Haven't I seen that face somewhere a long time ago
When I walk down the streets
See the stranger who says 'why, hi'
With a 'how you goin', buddy'
When you walked on by I thought I'd say hallo

They say: haven't I seen your face before
Weren't you the boy that used to live next door
Weren't you on television every night
Haven't I seen you round

Take a look at me, I'm yesterday's hero
Yesterday's hero, that's all I'll be
Take a look at me, I'm yesterday's hero
And yesterday's hero is all that I'm gonna be if I don't get together
Make a new start and be somebody better
All that I'll be if I don't get together now

When you walk down the streets
If you know me, then pass me by
If you wonder what I'm doing
Don't ask me why I don't read the news
When you walk down the streets
If you're sorry then don't feel bad
If you followed my story
Then just be glad you ain't in my shoes

Because haven't you seen my face before
Yes, I was the boy who used to live next door
Yes, I was on television every night
Haven't you seen me round

I'm like a prisoner captured by your eyes
I've been taken, I've been hypnotized

All the pain, all the tears
Many nights, many years
This love for me is fading
You waited, but I never came home to you

White bird in a golden cage
On a winter's day, in the rain
White bird in a golden cage
Alone

The leaves blow across the long black road
To the darkened sky, in its rage
But the white bird just sits in her cage
Unknown

White bird must fly, or she will die

White bird dreams of the aspen trees
With their dying leaves turning gold
But the white bird just sits in her cage
Growing old

White bird must fly, or she will die [x2]

The sunsets come, the sunsets go
The clouds roll by, the Earth turns slow
The young bird's eyes do always glow

She must fly [x3]

That keeps me close to you, whoa oh

You are the woman that I’ve always dreamed of
I knew it from the start
I saw your face and that’s the last I’ve seen of my heart

It’s not so much your pretty face I see
It’s not the clothes you wear
It’s more that special way you look at me
That always keeps me there, whoa oh whoa

You are the woman that I’ve always dreamed of
I knew it from the start
I saw your face and that’s the last I’ve seen of my heart

It’s hard to tell you all the love I’m feeling
That’s just not my style
You’ve got a way to send my senses reeling
Every time you smile, whoa oh

I have moved - and I've kept on moving - proved the points
That I needed proving
Lost the friends that I needed losing - found others
On the way

I have travelled hard, sometimes with conscience flying
Somewhere with the wind

About you all the time

What I will do tomorrow

Then I will disappear

547,The Wreck Of The Edmund Fitzgerald,"The legend lives on, from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they called Gitchee Gumee
The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead
When the skies of November turn gloomy
With a load of iron ore, 26,000 tons more
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty
That good ship and crew was a bone to be chewed
When the gales of November came early

The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and a captain well seasoned
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
When it left fully loaded for Cleveland
And later that night when the ship's bell rang
Could it be the north wind they'd been feeling?

The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
As a wave broke over the railing
And every man knew as the captain did too
Was the Witch of November come stealing
The dawn came late; the breakfast had to wait
When the gales of November came slashing
When afternoon came it was freezing rain
In the face of a hurricane west wind

When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck
Saying, ""Fellas, it's too rough to feed you.""
At seven pm, a main hatchway caved in
Said, ""Fellas, it's been good to know you.""
The captain wired in he had water coming in
The good ship and crew was in peril
And later that night when its lights went out of sight
Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald

Does anyone know where the love of God goes
When the waves turn the minutes to hours?
The searchers all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay
If they'd put fifteen more miles behind them
They might have split up, or they might have capsized
They may have broke deep and took water
All that remains is the faces and the names
Of the wives, the sons, the daughters

Lake Huron rolls, Superior sings
In the rooms of her ice water mansions
Old Michigan steams like a young person's dreams
The islands and bays are for sportsmen
And farther below Lake Ontario
Takes in what Lake Erie can send her
The iron boats go as the mariners all know
With the gales of November remembered

In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed
At the Maritime Sailors' Cathedral
The church bell chimed till it rang twenty-nine times
For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald
The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they called Gitchee Gumee
Lake Superior, it is said, never gives up her dead
When the gales of November come early",Rheostatics,1977,"[91, 78, 68]",3

549,Hello Old Friend,"[Verse 1]
As I am strolling down the garden path
I saw a flower glowing in the dark
It looked so pretty and it was unique
I had to bend down just to have a peek

[Chorus]
Hello, old friend
It is really good to see you once again
Hello, old friend
It is really good to see you once again

[Verse 2]
I saw you walking underneath the stars
I could not stop cause I was in a car
I am sure the distance would not be too far
If I got out and walked to where you are

[Chorus]
Hello, old friend
It is really good to see you once again
Hello, old friend
It is really good to see you once again

[Verse 3]
An old man passed me on the street today
I thought I knew him but I could not say
I stopped to think if I could place his frame
When he tipped his hat I knew his name

And wasted all my time
You could have got me mad girl
And made me lose my mind
But you did what you have to do
And every word you said to me was true
You gave me what I asked for
And I can't ask for anymore than you

It makes me very proud baby
To know that you're my girl
I want to say it loud baby
I want to tell the world
That you did what you had to do
And every word you said to me was true
You gave me what I asked for
And I can't ask for anymore than you
I've got everything a man could need
Oh I feel just like a slave that has been freed
I won't cry myself to sleep no more
'Cause I've found the love that I've been looking for

Now I don't have a problem
'Cause I know who I am
You see I lost my only problem
When you made me your man
'Cause you did what you had to do
And every word you said to me was true
You gave me what I asked for
And I can't ask for anymore than you",Cliff Richard,1977,"[91, 80]",2

Six feet deep, I've been under the water
Go and tell your top five I'm goin' harder
The one thing that I would never fuck with is karma
If it's war, I got a trunk full of armor
I'm the illest, I feel like I might kill 'em in any minute
So I'm spittin' out venom at anyone who wanna get it
Definition of realism, If I say it then I live it
Man, I've been in the system since I was little sippin' guinness
I'm a certified rockstar, I'm authentic
R.I.P. John Lennon, he gave me guitar lessons
I'm in Greece eating bak-la-va all winter
In the streets with the Ras-tas, who want get it
I don't get blinded by the fame and the money
In 2019 I'll be the face of my country
So hate if you a hater, but the hatin' disgustin'
I'm lookin' down on 'em like ""Ey, little buddy""
Self-made, I'm trynna change for the better
Y'all too busy worried 'bout a name on your sweater
Boy, I came with my gang and we sprayin' berettas
Y'all aim for the legs, and we aim for the neck-up
You verse us, ain't a good idea
I see you got your style at the hood IKEA
If you're lookin' for the truth you can look right here
'Cause we the shit now, we ain't about to go nowhere
When it's beef then my team on the front line
And they willin' and ready to squeeze when it's crunch time
Where I'm from you get punched over punchlines
I fall asleep to the sound of the gunfire
Raise a toast, the occasion is special
Suit and tie on, but I came from the ghetto
Hear the kick, then the snare, then the bass, then the treble
I used to smoke weed, now I blaze instrumentals

[Chorus]
You ain't gotta worry 'bout me, I'ma do me
Put my life on the line, I'ma ride for my team
Been through the ups and the downs
I'm still in these streets
Keep my ears to the ground
And my heart on my sleeve
You ain't gotta worry 'bout me, I'ma do me
Put my life on the line, I'ma ride for my team
Been through the ups and the downs
I'm still in these streets
Keep my ears to the ground
And my heart on my sleeve, my heart on my sleeve

[Verse 2]
Please name a rapper that actually want beef
Boy, I'm a pitbull and y'all just Maltese
So watch what you say cause I'm on a small leash
I'ma pull it out and shoot, I got it in arms reach
Catch a shot to the chest, I'm stoppin' your heart beat
Man, this shit to you a hobby, I'm at it like all week
I'm way bigger than you, go get in my car seat
Man, my price too high and all of your talk cheap
I'm an asshole and they tell me life a gamble
I bet it all with my cash low
Bitch, I've been in this game since Hasbro
I'm on fire taking shots of tabasco
I ain't never gonna give up, from get it I get you lit up
While you're lyin', we gorillas, you lookin' like little Simbas
I'm doing ab crunches and cardio with my chin ups
I've been eating these rappers and dippin' that shit in ketchup
Y'all goofs and the proofs in the put in
This shit's so hard, I'm in the booth with the Woody
I said it then I met it then these dudes couldn't stood it
All my crews wearing camos from the shoes to the hoodie
But it's risk too much too much to lose it all over nothin'
Went from fisticuffs, now I'm not with the fuck shit
They tough online but it's not that in public
It's Stompdown Killaz and it's not for discussion
So I sit back chillin' tryna analyze life
For the life of my team I would sacrifice mine
Real shit, I got 'em lookin' at me funny
Cause I did it for my family and it wasn't for the money
So I push it to the limit, I can feel it in my stomach
I don't do it cause I can
Man, I do it cause I love it
I'm going out with a bang now
Fuck it, I'm worried 'bout the culture
You worried bout money..

[Chorus]
You ain't gotta worry 'bout me, I'ma do me
Put my life on the line, I'ma ride for my team
Been through the ups and the downs
I'm still in these streets
Keep my ears to the ground
And my heart on my sleeve
You ain't gotta worry 'bout me, I'ma do me
Put my life on the line, I'ma ride for my team
Been through the ups and the downs
I'm still in these streets
Keep my ears to the ground
And my heart on my sleeve, my heart on my sleeve",Merkules,1977,[86],1
561,It's A Long Way There,"Hey, everybody, yeah, don't you feel that there's something

People on their own are getting nowhere
I'm on the road to see
If anything is anywhere or waiting, just for me

Everynight I walk around the city
Seems like I'll never know
That feeling of being together when I go

And it's a long way there
It's a long way to where I'm going
And it's a long way there
It's a long way to where I'm going

Hey, everybody, don't you feel that there's something
But you know in a moment it is gone
I live for the day when I can hear people saying
That they know and they care for everyone

But I feel like I've been here for the whole of my life
Never knowing home

It's a long way, it's a long, long, long way there
I'm gonna keep on tryin', I'm gonna keep on tryin', yeah
I'm gonna keep on tryin', keep on tryin'

Been away from home for such a long time
And got to know this town
But I don't seem to matter much to anyone who's around
Is there anybody around

Everynight I walk around the city
Seems like I'll never know
The feeling of being together when I go

And it's a long way there
It's a long way to where I'm going
And it's a long way there
It's a long way to where I'm going

Everybody knows it's a long way there
Oh, everybody knows it's a long way there
Mmm, it's a long way

Driving around's kind of getting me down and I know, and I know
It's a long long way there
It's such a long long way, long way

Hey, everybody, yeah, don't you feel that there's something
Feel it, feel it
Hey, everybody, yeah, don't you feel that there's something",Little River Band,1977,[92],1
562,"Baby, I'll Give It To You","Seals-Bogan

You say you wanna know what you gotta do
To make me forget what you put me through
So you want a chance to prove, lovin' me is everything to you

[Chorus:]
Baby, I'll give it to you. Baby, I'll give it to you
No one can make me feel like you do
Baby, I'll give it to you

I just want you to know, I know I done you wrong
When I wasn't here the nights were so long
And I wanted you so, but oh
Now I'm back again and I'm beggin' you please

[Chorus]
You gotta hold me closer than you did before
And always be there so I'll know for sure
I really, really love you and I'm here to stay
But I promise you tomorrow's gonna be a better day
Well, that's all we gotta do then baby I'll know
I'll be lovin' you, and we can start over

[Chorus]",Seals And Crofts,1977,[99],1
