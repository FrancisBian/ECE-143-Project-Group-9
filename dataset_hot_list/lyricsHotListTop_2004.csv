Snoop

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When the pimp's in the crib, ma
Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot
When the pigs try to get at you
Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot
And if a nigga get a attitude
Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot
I got the Rolly on my arm, and I'm pourin' Chandon
And I roll the best weed ‘cause I got it goin' on

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
I'm a nice dude, with some nice dreams
See these ice cubes? See these Ice Creams?
Eligible bachelor, million dollar boat
That's whiter than what's spillin' down your throat
The Phantom, exterior like fish eggs
The interior like suicide wrist red
I can exercise you, this can be your Phys. Ed
Cheat on your man, ma, that's how you get ahizzead
Killer with the beat, I know killers in the street
With the steel that'll make you feel like Chinchilla in the heat
So don't try to run up on my ear
Talkin' all that raspy shit, tryin' to ask me shit
When my niggas fill your vest they ain't gon' pass me shit
You should think about it, take a second (Ding)
Matter fact, you should take four, b
And think before you fuck with lil Skateboard P

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When the pimp's in the crib, ma
Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot
When the pigs try to get at you
Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot
And if a nigga get a attitude
Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot
I got the Rolly on my arm, and I'm pourin' Chandon
And I roll the best weed ‘cause I got it goin' on

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I'm a gangsta, but y'all knew that
Da Big Boss Dogg, yeah I had to do that
I keep a blue flag hangin' out my backside
But only on the left side, yeah, that's the Crip side
Ain't no other way to play the game the way I play
I cut so much you thought I was a DJ
""Two, one, yep, three!""
S-N double O-P, D-O double G
I can't fake it, just break it, and when I take it
See, I specialize in makin' all the girls get naked
So bring your friends, all of y'all come inside
We got a world premiere right here, now get live!
So don't change the dizzle, turn it up a little
I got a livin' room full of fine dime brizzles
Waitin' on the Pizzle, the Dizzle and the Chizzle
G's to the bizzack—now, ladies, here we gizzo!

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When the pimp's in the crib, ma
Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot
When the pigs try to get at you
Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot
And if a nigga get a attitude
Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot
I got the Rolly on my arm, and I'm pourin' Chandon
And I roll the best weed ‘cause I got it goin' on

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
I'm a bad boy, with a lot of hoes
Drive my own cars, and wear my own clothes
I hang out tough, I'm a real boss
Big Snoop Dogg, yeah he's so sharp
On the TV screen and in the magazines
If you play me close, you're on a red beam
Oh you got a gun, so you wanna pop back?
AK-47 now, nigga, stop that!
Cement shoes, now I'm on the move
Your family's cryin', now you on the news
They can't find you, and now they miss you
Must I remind you, I'm only here to twist you
Pistol-whip you, dip you, then flip you
Then dance to this mothafuckin' music we Crip to
Subscribe, nigga, get your issue
Baby, come close, let me see how you get loose!

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When the pimp's in the crib, ma
Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot
When the pigs try to get at you
Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot
And if a nigga get a attitude
Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot

Tell me would you ride for me 'til the very end?
You ain't gotta tell nobody, I'm your lover, I'm your friend

Tell me would you ride for me 'til the very end?

[Verse 2]
I might just throw back this perky and take a trip to Venus
That time I said I don't love you, girl I ain't really mean it
Why would you tell me you love me if you don't really mean it?
I got a show out in Texas, I might just gotta in
Keep it one hundred, I keep it a million
When I look in your eyes, I can tell how you feelin'
If you see it and want it, you know I'ma spend it
Gucci and Fendi, I buy it from Lenox
Came a long long way from the project's business
Brand new bust down iced out Rollies
You said that you love me, why don't you just show me?
Buy you a Mercedes and give you the door key
Bick back, bick back, ballin' like Kobe
When it's cold I just want you to hold me
These niggas be talkin', don't even really know me
It's off the love, baby girl you don't owe me
Chosen one, baby you are my trophy
Promise you gon' ride to the end
This that new Osiris and that QRN

Tell me would you ride for me 'til the very end?

I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier (la-de-dah-dah, dah-dah, dah-dah)
I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier
Yo...

[Verse 1]
Never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Never was a gangsta 'til I graduated to one
And got the rep of a villain, for weapon concealing
Took the image of a thug, kept shit appealing
Willing to stick out my neck for respect, if it meant
Life or death, never live to regret what I said
When you're me, people just wanna see if it's true
If it's you—what you say in your raps, what you do
So they feel it's part of your obligation to fulfill
When they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real?
In confrontation, ain't no conversation, if you feel
You're in violation, any hesitation'll get you killed
If you feel it, kill it; if you conceal it, reveal it
Being reasonable'll leave you full of bullets, pull it
Squeeze it 'til it's empty; tempt me, push me, pussies
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze

[Chorus]
(I'm a soldier) These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier) Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
(I'm a soldier) These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier) Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never stumble

[Verse 2]
I love pissing you off, gets me off
Like my lawyers when the fuckin' judge lets me off
All you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off
I'll violate and all the motherfucking bets be off
I'm a lit fuse, anything I do, bitch, it's news
Pistol-whippin' motherfucking bouncers 6'2""
Who needs bullets? As soon as I pull it, you sweat bullets
An excellent method to get rid of the next bully
It's actually better 'cause instead of you murderin'
You can hurt 'em and come back again and kick dirt at 'em
It's like pouring salt in the wounds, assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room
Everybody halts and stops, calls the cops
All you see is bitches coming out their halter tops
Running and ducking out the Hot Rocks parking lot
You'll all get shot, whether it's your fault or not, 'cause I'm a—

[Chorus]
(I'm a soldier) These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier) Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
(I'm a soldier) These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier) Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never stumble

[Verse 3]
I spit it slow so these kids know that I'm talking to 'em
Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em
I'm like a thug with a little bit of Pac influence
I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rocking to it
You motherfuckers could never do it like I could do it
Don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
Don't ever in your life try to knock the truest
I spit the illest shit ever been dropped in two-inch
So ticky-tock, listen as the sound ticks on the clock
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on a cock
Listen to the sound of me spilling my heart through this pen
Motherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again
Full of controversy until I retire my jersey
'Til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty
And Lord, have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me
And put a curse on authorities, in the face of adversity, I'm a—

[Chorus]
(I'm a soldier) These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier) Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
(I'm a soldier) These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier) Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never stumble

Need a lifeguard and I need protection
To put it on me deep in the right direction

You understand the facts that I'm tryin' to give to you

9,Breakaway,"[Verse 1]
Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreaming of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray (I would pray)

[Verse 2]
Trying hard to reach out
But when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I prayed (I would pray) I could break away

[Chorus 1]
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

[Verse 3]
Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get onboard a fast train
Travel on a jet plane, far away (I will)
And breakaway

[Chorus 1]
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
I won't forget all the ones that I love (I gotta)
I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

[Bridge]
Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging around revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me, but
Gotta keep moving on, moving on
Fly away, breakaway

[Chorus 2]
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly (Learn how to fly)
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget of the place I come from
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

10,Let's Go,"[Spoken Intro]
Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today
To get through this thing called ""life""
Electric word, life
It means forever and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you there's something else
The afterworld
A world of never ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night
So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything'll-Be-Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, baby
'Cause in this life
Things are much harder than in the after world
In this life
You're on your own
And if de-elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy (Punch a higher floor!)
Woo!

[Verse 1]
If you don't like
The world you're living in
Take a look around
At least you got friends
You see I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
(Ah, ah) is all I heard

[Pre-Chorus]
Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no lets go!

[Chorus]
Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck, let's go!

[Verse 2]
We're all excited
But we don't know why
Maybe it's cause
We're all gonna die
And when we do (when we do)
What's it all for? (what’s it all for?)
You better live now
Before the grim reaper come knocking on your door

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me, are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no let's go!

[Chorus]
Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck, let's go!

[Ad lib/Instrumental break]
C'mon baby
Let's get nuts!
Yeah
(Crazy)
Let's go crazy!

[Pre-Chorus]
Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no let's go!
Go (Go crazy)

[Bridge]
I said let's go crazy (go crazy)
Let's go (Let's go!)
Go (Let's go!)

Dr. Everything'll-Be-Alright
Will make everything go wrong
Pills and thrills and daffodils will kill

And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times
But somehow, I want more

17,Dare You To Move,"[Verse 1]
You're saying nothing
But your eyes do the talking
Through the greens and blues
I dare you to move
I dare you to move

Your heart is grooving
But your body's still refusing
Cause it's scared to lose
I dare you to move
I dare you to move

[Verse 2]
We're getting closer
But the night is nearly over
Gonna lose the moon
I dare you to move
I dare you to move

And now you're loving
There's a barrel full of tension
Gonna flood this room
I dare you to move
I dare you to move

[Chorus]
Run with me into midnight
Run with me while we're young
Rebels will run from street lights
To the burning sun
Run with me into violence
Run with me into blues
Hills can find horizons
If they dare to move

[Verse 3]
You're saying nothing
But your eyes do the talking
Through the greens and blues
I dare you to move
I dare you to move

Your heart is grooving
But your body's still refusing
Cause it's scared to lose
I dare you to move
I dare you to move

[Chorus]
Run with me into midnight
Run with me while we're young
Rebels will run from street lights
To the burning sun
Run with me into violence
Run with me into blues
Hills can find horizons
If they dare to move

Run with me into midnight
Run with me while we're young
Rebels will run from street lights
To the burning sun
Run with me into violence
Run with me into blues
Hills can find horizons
If they dare to move",McFly,2004,"[19, 17, 18, 19, 20, 28, 30, 33, 43, 49, 49, 55, 64]",13

[NINA]
This is my street
I smile at the faces
I’ve known all my life
They regard me with pride
And everyone’s sweet
They say, “You’re going places!’
So how can I say that while I was away
I had so much to hide!

“Hey guys, it’s me!
The biggest disappointment you know.”
The kid couldn’t hack it
She’s back and she’s walkin’ real slow
Welcome home
Just breathe...

As the radio plays old forgotten boleros
I think of the days when this city was mine
I remember the praise

“Ay, te adoro, te quiero,”

Said, “Nina, be brave and
You’re gonna be fine!”
And maybe it’s me
But it all seems like lifetimes ago

I am the one who made it out!
The one who always made the grade
But maybe I should have just stayed home…

When I was a child I stayed wide awake
Climbed to the highest place
On every fire escape
Restless to climb

I got every scholarship
Saved every dollar
The first to go to college
How do I tell them why
I’m coming back home?
With my eyes on the horizon

Ah! Ah, aah…

Just me and the GWB, asking, “Gee Nina, what’ll you be?""

Straighten the spine
Smile for the neighbors
Everything’s fine
Everything’s cool
The standard reply:
“Lots of tests, lots of papers.”
Smile, wave goodbye
And pray to the sky, oh, god…

Uh and I just wanna make..
Love, love, love
Yeah, I love it when you say
K-i-s-s me
Uh and I just wanna make
Love, love, love

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
A yo.. the crib got your friends working
We travel to France for french curtains
You was there when I was on the bench hurtin'
Now that I own my team
Its only right that I condone my queen
Try to show her my dream
And I can't let her get lost now
She carries the money, the hammer, and material across town
And understand she fine
Understand she mine
She understand the grind
Cooks, clean, and irons
And whatever shes wanna push I'mma cosign
And if I ain't got it already than I'mma go find it
I guess I'mma lucky don, and shes a lucky queen
Cause her jewelry box look likes Lucky Charms
All color stones
And she know that I'm in the hood, but she also knows that I'm coming home
Mr. Raspy, thought I was in love with money
'Til the first time we getting nasty

[Hook: Mariah Carey/Jadakiss]

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Uh yo, Whatever the road to paradise is we on it
Gave you your income tax checks so I can get on with
Those were the days, these are the times
You held me down with nearly damn near everything, even my rhymes
I will play a song for you
And you will let me know exactly how the ladies will respond from a womens
Point of view
And that's why my girl is with me
I love it when she layin' in the bed with a Pearl Long Vickie
The next best thing to a soldier
Go hard with a fat ass and a head full of rollers
Just look in her eyes and tell she's real
Just imagine the way she smell and the way she feel
The sex was crazy then and crazy still
And you know I'm from the streets so its crazy ill
And we waiting on the new island
We been to all them 4, 5 times come on mommy you whilin

[Hook: Mariah Carey/Jadakiss]

[Bridge: Jadakiss/Mariah Carey]
When things was ruff only person I could call was you
Now everything I do I do it all 4 you

Come touch me, come kiss me, come love me neway you wanna boy

N I'm hood as long as I'm close to you
N we doing wut grown folks is suppose to do

Come hold me, come feel me, come take me anyway you wanna baby

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
A yo the money is great but what we got is more better
We got the four letters when it comes from the heart its more pleasure
And for the fact that you trust me still
Thus far I appreciate what we build
All the minks that I bought you that dragged the floor
And all the nights you sat up and bagged the roar
Damn I'm thinking that you gotta hate it
But yet and still you tolerate it
That's why ma we gotta make it

21,How We Do,"[Chorus: 50 Cent]
This, is, how, we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This, is, how, we, do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love
This, is, how, we, do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This, is, how, we, do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love

[Verse 1: The Game]
Fresh like, uhh, Impala, uhh
Chrome hydraulics, 808, drums
You don't want, none, nigga better, run
When beef is on, I'll pop that, trunk
Come get, some, pistol grip, pump
If a nigga step on my white Air, Ones
It's red-rum, ready, here it come
Compton, uhh, Dre found me in the slums
Sellin' that skunk, one hand on my gun
I was sellin' rocks when Master P was sayin' ""Uhhhh!""
Buck pass the blunt
These G-Unit girls just wanna have, fun
Coke and rum, got weed on the ton
I'm bangin' with my hand up her dress like, uhh
I'll make her cum, purple haze in my lungs
Whole gang in the front in case a nigga wanna stunt

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I put Lamborghini doors on that Escalade
Low pro, so look like I'm ridin' on blades
In one year mayne, a nigga's so paid
I have a straight bitch in the telly goin' both ways (ahh!)
Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
I give it to you just how you like it, girl
You're now rockin' with the best
Tre pound on my hip, Teflon on my chest
They say I'm no good, cause I'm so hood
Rich folks do not want me around
'Cause shit might pop off, and if shit pop off
Somebody gon' get laid the fuck out
They call me new money, say I have no class
I'm from the bottom, I came up too fast
The hell if I care, I'm just here to get my cash
Bougie-ass bitches, you can kiss my ass

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
This, is, how, we, do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This, is, how, we, do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love
This, is, how, we, do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This, is, how, we, do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love

[Verse 3: The Game & 50 Cent]
I put gold Daytonas on that cherry six-fo'
White walls so clean, look like I'm ridin' on Vogues
Hit one switch mayne, that ass so low
Cali got niggas in New York ridin' on hundred spokes
Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
I give it to you just how you like it, girl
You're now rockin' with the best
Four pound on my hip, gold chain on my chest (ahh!)
50, uhh, Bentley, uhh
Em came and got a nigga fresh out the slum
Automatic, gun, fuck 'em one-on-one
We wrap up your punk ass, stunt and you done
Homie, it's Game time! You ready? Here it come
Call Lloyd Banks and get this motherfucker, crunk
It took two, months, but 50 got it done
Signed with G-Unit, had niggas like, ""Huh?""
Don't try to front, I'll leave your ass, slumped
Thinkin' I'm a punk get your fuckin' head, lumped
50 got a, gun! Ready? Here it come
Got a sick ven-detta to get this, cheddar
Meet my Be-retta, the drama, setter
Sip Ama-retta, my flow sounds, better
Than average, on tracks I'm a savage, I damage

""But I'm only going to get this one chance."" (Six minutes— Six minutes—)
""Something's wrong, I can feel it."" (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
""Just a feeling I've got. Like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. 
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; 
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances.""
""You are just what the doc ordered.""

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot

[Verse 1]
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody wants the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got

[Verse 2]
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!""—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard

[Verse 3]
So you'll be Thor, I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?!
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?",Eminem,2004,"[24, 18, 17, 15, 14, 14, 15, 16, 21, 25, 44, 51, 71]",13
23,Karma,"[Verse 1]
I held you down for the longest
And I was there through all of your darkest moments
Feels just like yesterday when we were homeless
Gotchu some bread and start treating me bogus
Talking 'bout you wanted something new (something new)
Like I wasn't good enough for you (good for you)
Guess you done caught you a case of amnesia
Maybe you should take a look in your rear view
'Cause obviously you forgot all the times that I held you when you cried
And don't you remember that even if you was in the wrong I stood by your side?
No I guess not, I guess not, 'cause you let them thots take my spot
Congratulations to you, what you wanted is what you got now (you got now babe)

[Chorus]
So you don't gotta worry 'bout me (oh, oh woah)
You made it clear that you're unhappy (unhappy, yeah)
Go ahead and have your fun now (fun now)
Just remember what goes around, comes around
You don't gotta worry 'bout me (don't gotta worry, baby)
You made it clear that you're unhappy (you're unhappy, yeah)
Go ahead and have your fun now (have your fun now)
Just remember what goes around, comes around

[Verse 2]
I remember when you said that you could have somebody better
And I can't even lie to you it really messed my head up
Had me lookin' in the mirror disgusted with myself
Wishin' that I looked like someone else
Like the girls you liked on Instagram (damn)
And you really had the nerve to call me insecure

[Intro]
Thank you, thank you, thank you!
You're far too kind

[Chorus]
Now, can I get a encore? Do you want more?
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Now what the hell are you waitin' for?
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga, make some noise!

[Verse 1]
Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back
Yeah, hearin' me rap is like hearin' G Rap in his prime
I'm Young H-O, rap's Grateful Dead
Back to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country, but the blueberry still connect
On the low, but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep
Grand openin', grand closin'
Goddamn, your man Hov' cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him?
With no pen, just draw off inspiration
Soon you gonna see you can't replace him
With cheap imitations for these generations

[Chorus]
Now, can I get an encore? Do you want more?
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Now what the hell are you waitin' for?
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga, make some noise!

[Verse 2]
(*Sighs*) Look what you made me do! Look what I made for you!
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yeah)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan
Wearin' the 4-5, it ain't to play games with you
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin' you to smithereens
Cocksucker, take one for your team!
And I need you to remember one thing (one thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales to sold-out concerts
So, motherfucker, if you want this encore
I need you to scream 'til your lungs get sore

[Interlude]
Owww, it's star time
This man is mean, he's killin' all y'all jive turkeys
Do y'all want more of the Jigga man?
Well, if y'all want more of the Jigga man
Then I need y'all to help me bring him back to stage
Say ""Hova!"" – c'mon, say it!
Are y'all out there? [crowd chants ""HO-VA! HO-VA!""]
C'mon, louder!
Yeah, now see that's what I'm talking about
They love you, Jigga! They love you, Jigga!

[Break]
I like the way this one feel
It's so motherfuckin' soulful, man!
(Whoaaaaaahhhh, whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh, whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh)
Yeah [crowd still chanting] okay

[Verse 3]
So this here is the victory lap
Then I'm leavin', that's how you get me back
After a year of them 16's, it's 1.2
And that's 2.4, and I'm only doin' two
You wanted to gain attention, new dudes
I can get you BET – and TRL, too
You want to be in the public, send your budget
Well, fuck it, I ain't budgin'
Young did it to death, you gotta love it
Record companies told me I couldn't cut it
Now look at me: all star-studded
Golfer above par like I putted
All ‘cause the shit I uttered was utterly ridiculous
How sick is this?
You want to bang, send Kanye change
Send Just some dust, send Hip a grip
Then you gotta spit a little somethin' like this

25,Boulevard Of Broken Dreams,"[Verse 1]
I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me, and I walk alone
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

[Chorus]
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

[Verse 2]
I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What's fucked up, and everything's all right
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

[Chorus]
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

26,Some Beach,"[Verse 1]
Driving down the interstate
Running thirty minutes late
Singing Margaritaville and minding my own
Some foreign car driving dude with the road rage attitude
Pulled up beside me talking on his cell phone
He started yelling at me like I did something wrong
He flipped me the bird and then he was gone

[Chorus]
Some beach, somewhere
There's a big umbrella casting shade over an empty chair
Palm trees are growing and a warm breezes a blowing
I picture myself right there
On some beach, somewhere

[Verse 2]
I circled the parking lot trying to find a spot
Just big enough I could park my old truck
A man with a big cigar was getting into his car
I stopped and I waited for him to back up
But from out of nowhere a Mercedes Benz
Came cruising up and whipped right in

[Chorus 2]
Some beach, somewhere
There's nowhere to go when you got all day to get there
There's cold margaritas and hot señioritas smiling with long dark hair
On some beach, somewhere

[Verse 3]
I sat in that waiting room
It seemed like all afternoon
The nurse finally said doc's ready for you
You’re not going to feel a thing we'll give you some Novocain
That tooth will be fine in a minute or two
But he stuck that needle down deep in my gum
And he started drilling before I was numb

[Chorus 3]
Some beach, somewhere
There's a beautiful sunset burning up that atmosphere
There's music and dancing and lovers romancing
In the salty evening air
On some beach, somewhere

27,Charlene,"[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning found a letter that she wrote
She said she's tired that I'm always on the road
Too hard to swallow being alone
She needs someone at night that she can hold
She must have told me a thousand times before
Silent cries I use to ignore
God knows I love her
Didn't mean to hurt her

[Chorus]
Baby I'll be
Sitting here waiting on you to come home again
I won't leave
Promise I'll be here to the very end
By your side
To protect you and to love you and to be with you for life
Come on home to me Charlene

[Verse 2]
She knows I really love this old music thing
Since I was a child it's been my dream
I can support her treat her and spoil her
You know buy her the finer things
But I forgot about loving her
Damn the money, diamonds, and pearls
What about the hard day she had with the baby
All she need is for me to love her

[Chorus]
Baby I'll be
Sitting here waiting on you to come home again
I won't leave
Promise I'll be here to the very end
By your side
To protect you and to love you and to be with you for life
Come on home to me Charlene

[Bridge]
Promise I can't live without her
God knows I need her loving
And it hurts so bad that's she gone away
I pray that she'll come back one day
In my life

Baby I'll be
Sitting here waiting on you to come home again
I won't leave
Promise I'll be here to the very end
By your side

Nothing like them 80s summer NY days
Hop on the MB5 days
Mopeds, Pro Keds, city split five ways
How it all started, fifth floor apartment
A jigsaw puzzle aerial view of the projects
A kid saw struggle, buried a few of his partners
Now I chill in resorts, enjoying massages
Check out the oracle bred from city housing

I remember seeing Shan chilling near his Audi (near his Audi)
Hollis had Run and them but I proudly
Put a poster up of Shan and Marley, that was art kid

[Verse 2: Nas]
To call them fake today is hate, real niggas extinct
Pac left me inside a rap world with niggas that wink
At other rappers, undercover niggas spit every way
Won't be surprised if all their rides have federal plates
Let alone their wardrobes and Studio 4 flow
It was real when I appeared, it would've been some jaws broke
Nas, my real name, stage name, same thing
How could you let these lames claim king, I'm so ashamed, man
I light a L for Vernon for niggas who would burn in Hell for Vernon
10th Street, 12th Street, Nightmare on Elm Street
Pimps creep, delve deep inside the editorials
Of the ghetto queens, kings, stories true
Who possesses the testicular fortitude
To blow away myths that's a hindrance to all of you
You blame your own shortcomings on sex and race
The mafia, homosexuals and all the Jews
It's hogwash point of views, stereotypical
Anti-Semitic like the foul words Gibson spewed
And it's pathetic, I don't get the credit I deserve
That's why I hate doing interviews
But I don't sweat it, study long, study raw

I'm not a wack performer standing near a corny hype man
I got the Donism in me, I'm here to enlighten

Who locked up, first I regretted it, then caught my rage
Like, how could I not protect her from this awful phase?
Never tried to hide who I was, she was taught and raised
Like a princess, but while I'm on stage I can't leave her defenseless
Plus she's seen me switchin' women, Pops was on some pimp shit
She heard stories of her daddy thuggin'
So if her husband is a gangster, can't be mad, I'll love him
Never, for her I want better, homie in jail – dead that
Wait 'til he come home, you can see where his head's at
Niggas got game, they be tryna live
He seen your Mama crib, plus I'm sure he know who your father is
Although you real, plus a honest kid
Don't think I'm slow, I know you probably had that chronic lit
You seventeen, I got a problem with it
She looked at me like I'm not the cleanest father figure
But she rockin' with it

[Hook]
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important

[Verse 2]
This morning I got a call, nearly split my wig
This social network said: ""Nas, go and get your kid!""
She's on Twitter, I know she ain't gon' post no pic
Of herself underdressed – no inappropriate shit, right?
Her mother cried when she answered
Said she don't know what got inside this child's mind, she planted
A box of condoms on her dresser, then she Instagram'd it
At this point I realized I ain't the strictest parent
I'm too loose, I'm too cool with her
Should've drove more time to school with her
I thought I dropped enough jewels on her
Took her from private school, so she can get a balance
To public school, they're too nurture teen talents
They grow fast, one day she's your little princess
Next day she's talkin' boy business – what is this?
They say the coolest playas and foulest heart breakers in the world
God gets us back, he makes us have precious little girls

[Hook]
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important

[Verse 3]
And I ain't tryin' to mess your thing up
But I just wanna see you dream up
I finally understand
It ain't easy to raise a girl as a single man
Nah, the way mothers feel for they sons
How fathers feel for they daughters
When he date, he straight, chip off his own papa
When she date, we wait behind the door with a sawed-off
‘Cause we think no one is good enough for our daughters

[Verse 1: Bodega Bamz]
Tour bus looking like a brothel
Catching more bodies than Hostel
Flatbush Zombies put money in my pocket
If it's war against them, I'ma pop it
Word like apostles
Kid from the ghetto listening to heavy metal, rock rolled in my sock
I ain't never been afraid, renegade got bars like mess halls
Locked three meals in the cot, nigga, what?
Pussy at noon got me feeling brand new
When the sun come down, I'm leavin'
Fuck I look like? A fool?
Throwing shade like cool, bitch don't wake me up, I'm dreamin'
Puff, puff, pass, that's old school
I'm getting yesterday's paper, that's old news
The way I'm programmed, I never hold hands
Straight business, first class, never the coach
I'ma handle the game the way I handle the coke
Hand to hand on Instagram, picture the post
Nigga, picture me broke, I got a pitcher of Henny
I know my liver be ready for adios, but I'm stuck like
I'm a sure thing, I don't close call
I mean we all kings, but there's one god
There's one Allah, there's one Jah, bless

[Verse 2: Erick Arc Elliott]
Now I pose for pictures, can't fuck with you, be more specific
Cross me like when you beg forgiveness
I didn't like your vibe so I kept my distance
Niggas do it all for the paper
Institution was made then strewn to little girls and boys
But now ""the world is yours,"" my nigga please
I done gross over a hundred G's
That's a lot of of money, still I'm screaming, ""Fuck the police!""
In my motions I can't pretend that I'm different than you
But nigga listen and pay attention when I make a move
Vision blurred, I don't see no deterrence
But seeing the same niggas then saying the same words
Cycling that nature, puffing the same flavor
My niggas is Tanboys, original delegators
We ripping the floor panel and all
With a matter of force we go and handle you boys
We only family of course

[Verse 3: Meechy Darko]
Nobody ever gave a fuck about us, you never believed
Can't believe they fucking doubted, now they can see
Child of the corn, Darko, freak off the leash
Rather unique, who art thou Van Gogh?
Randy Savage on beats, I bark proud, pitbull
If you break in my house he bark wild, fuck you talking 'bout?!
Lil nigga I spark proud, pop a band
Throw up bread, you should learned it by now
Make 'em say, ""ugh,"" then examine her mouth
Then it's get to stepping, I'm kicking Pamela out (Get to stepping!)
That Tommy hold a lot of slugs might be a hundred rounds
Them Flatbush niggas a shmurda ya, rusty tre pounds
Shoot you and throw it in the air, like a cap and gown
I demand the throne and the crown, tell 'em I want it now (Ha!)
Hair swinging when I'm shooting like O-Dog in that movie
Zombie gang fully lucid, Bathing Ape, fully draped
GG Allin lucky I ain't get to shit on his grave
Knuckle it behind bars like a prisoner in cage
Johnny Cage, black shades, hit off half yo face
My orange box-cutter make the world rotate
My orange box-cutter make the world rotate
On its axis, acid, sheets that ain't for the mattress, bastard

[Verse 4: Zombie Juice]
I need a honor roll for this shit, I need a honor roll for this shit
Thank the Lord it's lit, thank the Lord it's lit
Hopping out a bodega, need a pack, never later, later
Flatbush, Tanboy stylin' (WHOO!)
All my niggas get lit like a chalice, all my niggas get lit like a chalice
Cookies in my blunt, liquor in my gut, most you niggas suck
I'm on top of the world like Brandy said
So high, so high like Michel'le
Feeling unstoppable every bone and my particles
In the cut blowing tropicals
And they said it's impossible for a black young man to kill this shit
For a tan young man to kill this shit
So, more or less I do my thing
No stress, no crane, progression, mane
More or less we do our thing
No stress, no crane, progression, mane

Are we better off believing
What the ignorance suggests?
I wish living life was easy (Mhm)
But mine has been a mess
They say it comes with the seasons (Mhm)
But the seasons come and go (They go)
I go blurry when I'm thinking
Is it me or vertigo?

Criticized, who am I to give up?
I’m breathing, what's the reason to let up?

Yeah

[Verse 2]
I've been better off than broken
I’ve been battered, I've been beat
I wish I was more outspoken
But the words are out of reach
Hmm, thought I loved you in the moment
I was happy, I was young
I've been learning, I've been growing
But the worst is yet to come

Criticized, who am I to give up? (Who am I?)
I'm breathing, what's the reason to let up?

Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that!
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back, yeah, hearin' me rap
Is like hearin' G. Rap in his prime, I'm
Young H.O., rap's grateful dead
'Bout to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep!
Grand openin', grand closin'
God damn, your man Hov' cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him
With no pen, just draw off inspira-tion-tion
Soon you gon' see you can't replace him-him
With cheap imitations for these generations

Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you?
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you (Look how they wave to you)
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (Yeah)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan
Wearin' the 45, it ain't to play games with you
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin' you to smithereens
Cocksucker, take one for your team
And I need you to remember one thing (One thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales, to sold-out concerts
So, motherfucker, if you want this encore
I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore (Come on)

[Verse 3: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take!

[Chorus 2: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb

You must got me fucked up, think I changed when I got that all white Benz?

Been on my job, sayin' I'm different now
Say I don't listen now
I don't got time to pick up the phone to hear what you bitchin' 'bout

Let's talk this over
It's not like we're dead
Was it something I did?
Was it something you said?
Don't leave me hanging
In a city so dead
Held up so high
On such a breakable thread (breakable thread)

[Pre-Chorus]
You were all the things I thought I knew
And I thought we could be

You were everything, everything that I wanted (that I wanted)

You've got your dumb friends
I know what they say (know what they say)
They tell you I'm difficult
But so are they (but so are they)
But they don't know me
Do they even know you? (even know you?)
All the things you hide from me
All the shit that you do (all the shit that you do)

Thanks for acting like you cared
And making me feel like I was the only one
It's nice to know we had it all
Thanks for watching as I fall
And letting me know we were done

42,"Awful, Beautiful Life","I woke up early this morning with a pounding in my head
I'd been out the night before with all my friends
A little worried, kinda wondering what i did
I said lord please forgive me for my sins
My wife wanted to kill me but she tried to save me first
You're going if i have to drag your butt to church

I love this crazy, tragic
Sometimes almost magic
Awful, beautiful life

I read the hymns and kinda sorta sang along
Made it throught the sunday sermon wide awake
We met the family for dinner at our home
Drank some beers, watched the game and cooked some steaks
My little brother had a big fight with his wife
My poor mother sat between them both all night

I love this crazy, tragic
Sometimes almost magic
Awful, beautiful life

We said a prayer for cousin micheal in iraq
We're all aware he may never make it back
We talked about the way we missed his stupid jokes
And how he wanted to be a soldier more than most

I laid in bed that night and thought about the day
And how my life was like a rollercoaster ride
The ups and downs and crazy turns along the way
It'll throw you off if you don't hold on tight
You can't really smile until you've shed some tears
I could die today or i might live on for years

I love this crazy, tragic
Sometimes almost magic
Awful, beautiful life

43,Just Lose It,"[Intro: Eminem]
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, okay!
Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright, stop… pajama time!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Come here, little kiddies! On my lap!
Guess who's back with a brand new rap?
And I don't mean ""rap"" as in a new case
Of child molestation accusations
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, no worries
Papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I done touched on everything but little boys
And that's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bung-hole
And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know; who'd hear it?
Give a little ""poot poot,"" it's okay
(*fart*) Oops, my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now, I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl… girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it! (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!)
Just lose it! (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!)
Go crazy! (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!)

[Bridge 1: Eminem]
Well, it's Friday and it's my day
Just to party all the way 'til Sunday
Maybe 'til Monday, I don't know what day
Every day's just a holiday
Cruisin' on the freeway, feelin' kinda breezy
Let the top down and my hair blow
I don't know where I'm goin', all I know is
When I get there someone's gonna touch my body

[Verse 2: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
'Scuse me, miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out? (Yeah)
Now, what's your name, girl? What's your sign?
Man, you must be up out your mind!
Dre (ah, aA), be-!e,r goggles, blind
I'm just tryin' to unwind, now I'm…

[Bridge 2: Eminem]
Well, it's Tuesday and I'm locked up
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was runnin' butt-naked
Down the street screamin', (Ah, ah, ah, ah!)
Your honor, I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much, I'm not guilty
They said, ""Save it, boy, we got you on tape
Yellin' at an old lady to touch my body!""

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back, and everybody lose themselves
Now snap back to reality; look, it's B. Rabbit!
""Yo, you signed me up to battle? I'm a grown man!""
Chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubby
I don't have any lines to go right here, so chubba Teletubby
Fellas! (What?) Fellas! (What?)
Grab your left nut, make your right one jealous (what?)
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls
Tall girls, small girls, I'm calling all girls
Everyone report to the dance floor
It's your chance for a little romance or
Butt-squeezin', it's the season
Just go, (Ah, ah, ah, ah-!); it's so appeasin'

I don't give a fuck about your faults or mishappens
Nigga, we from the Bronx, New York; shit happens
Kids clappin', love to spark the place
Half the niggas in the Squad got a scar on their face
It's a cold world and this is ice
Half a mil' for the charm, nigga, this is life
Got the Phantom in front of the building, Trinity Ave
Ten years been legit, they still figure me bad
As a youngin, was too much to cope with
Why you think, muh'fuckers nicknamed me Cook Coke shit?
Should've been called Armed Robbery
Extortion, or maybe Grand Larceny
I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle
Just as long, I knew me and my peoples was gon' bubble
Came out the gate on some Flo-Jo shit
Fat nigga with the shotty was the logo, kid

I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants and, do the rockaway

And I just bought a bike so I can ride 'til I die
With a matchin' jacket, 'bout to cop me a mansion
My niggas in the club, but you know they not dancin'
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance, we boogie
So never mind how we got in here with burners and hoodies
Listen, we don't pay admission and the bouncers don't check us
And we walk around the metal detectors
And there really ain't a need for a V.I.P section
In the middle of the dance floor reckless, check it
Said he, liked my necklace, started relaxin'
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
See, money ain't a thang, nigga, we still the same niggas
Flows just changed, now we 'bout to change the game, nigga

Now we living better now, Coogi sweater now
And that G4 can fly through any weather now
See, niggas get tight when you worth some millions
This is why I sport the chinchilla: to hurt they feelings
You can find Joe Crack at all type of shit
Out in Vegas front row to all the fights and shit
If 5-0 boy come then they'd proudly squeal
Cause half these rappers they blow like Derek Foreal
If you cross the line, damn right I'm gon' hurt you
These faggot niggas even made gang signs commercial
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin' it up
B2K Crip walkin' like, ""That's what's up!""

Matter of fact, I don't wanna speak about the Rucker

Can goods scattered all the way to the curb

Western sky all turning red
Head on my shoulder she sighed and said

Been gophering, chauffeuring, company chairman
Coffee maker, Copy repairman
Anymore there ain't nothing I swear man that I don't do
Been juggling, struggling, closing big deals
Dancing backwards in high heels

She said it sure is nice to just be the woman with you

She said the girl I was with the business degree probably wouldn't recognize me
I was gonna run the bank
I was gonna run the math
Now all I want to run is a bubble bath

Before all of this reality set in
Here comes life boy ready or not
Hey I wanted it all and that's what I got

You know, you think I'm tryna holla at you
And maybe I am but
You wouldn't hear me out anyway's would you?

Rather lose love than to move on never knowing what it feel like
Short days, long nights
By the phone, no call
Need a clear mind cause I been blind, got me goin' down that road
Heart made of stone
Far away from home
Black woman you cold
Every problem that you ever had with another man I gotta face
Started off on thin ice
I'm still here but I can't skate
Slow sink, can't breathe, no remorse, don't think
Listen to your friend get another man for a minute then repeat
Queen, you deserve the title but she rejects what I give, while she nurse the wounds by them
Tried them didn't work
Got impossible standards
Nothing I'ma do is gon work

Hates her baby father so, so

Saying fuck a nigga quick, quick

Your girlfriend's man cheat, cheat
Why not me the same thing
She can't see in me, what I see in her
This pain she inherit can't be reversed
I can't even stay living in the shade of all the motherfuckers that played ya
The irony in that is that I ain't even that, but you put it those pages
Wife, you deserve the label but, but you been hurt before so you sore and don't feel your able

[Verse 3: Wale]
See all I ever wanna do is be relevant
Just tell me that I ever meant anything
Or that you could ever see me and you in another light
But it's like the dark women endures the darkest nights by the wrong man
And see mostly all of them have made you somewhat incapable of a first impression
What I do is I channel my aggression with no cable or antenna
Just intentions to impress you, if capable
Hoping that the material possessions can materialize to a better you
Cars, nothing I drive can drive you out of this frame of mind
With such an ugly picture in it and
Money, nothing I buy can buy me more time for your ears to tell your heart to listen to it
Diamonds, a girl's best friend is what they say, but believe me with the right allegiance shorty you gon shine anyways
And every day that goes by is a couple more lines in her diary
The day before is better than the present
So anyone presented in her presence endures these life sentences
No key for release
No reason to be around
Her minds in the clouds
She writes it all down
In her diary

I wonder why, I sit and cry
Wish I could shed all these tears

Cause I have never felt one so right
Each look into your eyes, I'm falling

Looks like we started us a fire
Wrapped up in flames of desire
With every touch, they're burning higher
Two shadows dancing on the wall

With nothing on but the radio
Feel the music playing soft and slow
You and me and the lights down low
With nothing on but the radio

We'll fall asleep here in the moonlight
In tangled sheets, we'll be here all night
And when we wake up in the morning
We might stay like this all day

Two lovers dreaming of forever
And it just keeps on getting better
With every tender little kiss

53,When I Think About Cheatin',"I've never done anything
That would ever bring a tear to your eye
I've never crossed the line
Or needed an alibi to cover up a lie
But darling I'll admit
There've been times when I could have
The thing that kept me strong
Is the one thing that is always on my mind

[Chorus]
When I think about cheatin'
I just think about you leavin'
And how my world would fall to pieces
If I tossed your love away
Even when I'm tempted by some stranger
Oh there's never any danger
I just think about you leavin'
When I think about cheatin'

There was a time in Abilene
When he said all the things I wanted to hear
It was hard to turn him down
Between the champagne and the sound of whispers in my ear
But it just took one two-step with someone, and I was missing you
He never had a chance, cause I broke up the dance
Before the song was through

54,You're My Better Half,"[Verse 1]
Car door slams, it's been a long day at work
I'm out on the freeway and I'm wondering if it's all worth
The price that I pay, sometimes it doesn't seem fair
I pull into the drive and you're standing there
And you look at me
And give me that come-here-baby smile
It's all going to be alright
You take my hand
You pull me close and you hold me tight

[Chorus]
And it's the sweet love that you give to me
That makes me believe we can make it through anything
Because when it all comes down
And I'm feeling like I'll never last
I just lean on you because baby
You're my better half

[Verse 2]
They say behind every man is a good woman
But I think that's a lie
Because when it comes to you I'd rather have you by my side
You don't know how much I count on you to help me win
When I've given everything I got and I just feel like giving in
And you look at me
And give me that come-here-baby smile
It's all going to be alright
You take my hand
Yeah you pull me close and you hold me tight

That makes me believe we can make it through anything

Well, I couldn't tell you
Why she felt that way
She felt it everyday
And I couldn't help her
I just watched her make
The same mistakes again

What's wrong, what's wrong now?
Too many, too many problems
Don't know where she belongs
Where she belongs

[Chorus]
She wants to go home, but nobody's home

She's falling behind
She can't find her place
She's losing her faith
She's fallen from grace

56,Mud On The Tires,"[Verse 1]
I've got some big news
The bank finally came through
And I'm holding the keys to a brand new Chevrolet
Have you been outside it sure is a nice night
How about a little test drive
Down by the lake

There's a place I know about where the dirt road runs out
And we can try out the four-wheel drive
Come on now what do you say
Girl, I can hardly wait to get a little mud on the tires

[Chorus]
Cause it's a good night
To be out there soaking up the moonlight
Stake out a little piece of shoreline
I've got the perfect place in mind
It's in the middle of nowhere only one way to get there
You got to get a little mud on the tires

[Verse 2]
Moonlight on a duck blind
Catfish on a trot line
Sun sets about nine this time of year
We can throw a blanket down
Crickets singing in the background
And more stars than you can count on a night this clear

I tell you what we need to do is grab a sleeping bag or two
And build us a little campfire
And then with a little luck we might just get stuck
Let's get a little mud on the tires

[Chorus]

And then with a little luck we might just get stuck

57,Mr. Mom,"[Intro]
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Lost my job, came home mad
Got a hug and a kiss and ""that's too bad""
She said, ""I can go to work until you find another job""
I thought, I like the sound of that
Watch TV and take long naps
Go from a hard working dad to being Mr. Mom

[Chorus]
Well
Pampers melt in a Maytag dryer
Crayons go up one drawer higher
Rewind Barney for the fifteenth time
Breakfast six, naps at nine
There's bubble gum in the baby's hair
Sweet potatoes in my lazy chair
Been crazy all day long
And it's only Monday Mr. Mom

[Verse 2]
Football, soccer, and ballet
Squeeze in Scouts and PTA
And there's that shopping list she left that's seven pages long
How much smoke can one stove make?
The kids won't eat my charcoal cake
It's more than any man can take
Being Mr. Mom

[Chorus]
Well
Pampers melt in a Maytag dryer
Crayons go up one drawer higher
Rewind Barney for the sixteenth time
Breakfast six, naps at nine
There's bubble gum in the baby's hair
Sweet potatoes in my lazy chair
Been crazy all day long
And it's only Monday Mr. Mom

Before I fall in bed tonight
If the dog didn't eat the classifieds
I'm gonna look just one more time

Crayons go up one drawer higher

58,Nothin 'Bout Love Makes Sense,"[Verse 1]
Like a cloud full of rain shouldn't hang in the sky
Ice shouldn't burn or a bumble bee fly
If you feel so happy, then why do you cry
Oh, nothin' 'bout love makes sense
Like an ocean liner shouldn't float on the sea
A pearl in an oyster or a circus of fleas
Someone so perfect can't be fallin' for me
Oh nothin' 'bout love makes sense

[Chorus]
Nothin' 'bout love is less than confusin'
You can win when you're losin'
Stand when you're fallin'
I can't figure it out
Nothin' 'bout love can make an equation
Nothin' short of amazin'
Wish I could explain it
But I don't know how

[Verse 2]
The way that we dance
The reason we dream
That big Italian tower
Oh, how does it lean
Somethin' so strong
Shouldn't make me this weak
Oh, nothin' 'bout love makes sense

Nothin' 'bout love is less than confusin'
You can win when you're losin'
Stand when you're fallin'

Wish I could explain it
But I don't know how

Lookin' to burn down this night
Tailgates dropped, radios up
Little jack, little crown spillin down, fillin' up those cups

[Pre-Chorus]
They're probably starin' down that muddy field
Waitin' on my high beams, my KCs
They know I wouldn't miss a party like that for anything
But they can't see what I see

I'm layin', layin' you down on the other side of town
Nobody around, but you and me baby
The high that you got me on is some kinda strong
Your whiskey kiss is all that I need
So give me one more
Just like the first four
And I'll hold you all night long girl
Come lay your head down
Down on my chest
It's a party for two in this truck bed

[Verse 2]
Right now, the whiskey's chilled
Radio low, you and me, kickin' it up on this hill
The moon's shinin', the stars are bright
But I've never seen 'em, like I see 'em, when I see 'em in your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
They're probably starin' down that muddy field
Waitin' on my high beams, my KCs
That's why I picked this spot where only my truck can make it
Girl, in case they came lookin' for me

I'm layin', layin' you down on the other side of town
Nobody around, but you and me baby
The high that you got me on is some kinda strong

60,Bless The Broken Road,"[Verse 1]
I set out on a narrow way many years ago
Hoping I would find true love along the broken road
But I got lost a time or two
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through
I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you

[Chorus]
Every long lost dream led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart, they were like Northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God bless the broken road that led me straight to you
(Yes, he did)

[Verse 2]
I think about the years I spent just passing through
I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you
But you just smile and take my hand
You've been there, you understand
It's all part of a grander plan that is coming true

[Chorus]
Every long lost dream led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart, they were like Northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God bless the broken road that led me straight to you

I remember I was 18
Money, pussy, parties, I was on the same thing
You gotta give a boy a chance to grow some
Everybody talkin' like they know somethin' these days
Niggas actin' woke, but they broke, umm
I respect the struggle but you all frontin' these days
Man, they barely old enough to drive
To tell them what they should do, who the fuck am I?
I heard one of 'em diss me, I'm surprised
I ain't trippin', listen good to my reply
Come here lil' man, let me talk with ya
See if I can paint for you the large picture
Congrats 'cause you made it out your mama's house
I hope you make enough to buy your mom a house
I see your watch icy and your whip foreign
I got some good advice, never quit tourin'
'Cause that's the way we eat here in this rap game
I'm fuckin' with your funky lil' rap name
I hear your music and I know that rap's changed
A bunch of folks would say that that's a bad thing
'Cause everything's commercial and it's pop now
Trap drums is the shit that's hot now

But never mind, that was just a segue

And plus, you havin' fun and I respect that
But have you ever thought about your impact?
These white kids love that you don't give a fuck
'Cause that's exactly what's expected when your skin black
They wanna see you dab, they wanna see you pop a pill
They wanna see you tatted from your face to your heels
And somewhere deep down, fuck it, I gotta keep it real
They wanna be black and think your song is how it feels
So when you turn up, you see them turnin' up too
You hit the next city, collect your money when it's due
You gettin' that paper, swimmin' in bitches, I don't blame you
You ain't thinkin' 'bout the people that's lookin' like me and you
True, you got better shit to do
You coulda bought a crib with all that bread that you done blew
I know you think this type of revenue is never endin'
But I wanna take a minute just to tell you that ain't true
One day, them kids that's listening gon' grow up
And get too old for that shit that made you blow up
Now your show's lookin' light cause they don't show up
Which unfortunately means the money slow up
Now you scramblin' and hopin' to get hot again
But you forgot you only popped 'cause you was ridin' trends
Now you old news and you goin' through regrets
'Cause you never bought that house, but you got a Benz
And a bunch of jewels and a bunch of shoes
And a bunch of fake friends, I ain't judgin' you
I'm just tellin' you what's probably gon' happen when you rappin'
'Bout the type of shit you rappin' 'bout
It's a faster route to the bottom
I wish you good luck
I'm hoping for your sake that you ain't dumb as you look
But if it's really true what people sayin'
And you call yourself playin' with my name

You left your Bible on the dresser
So I put it in the drawer
'Cause I can't seem to talk to God
Without yelling anymore
And when I sit at your piano
I can almost hear those hymns
The keys are just collecting dust
But I can't close the lid

[Chorus]
You left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church
It used to be so full of faith
And now it only hurts
And I can hear the devil whisper
""Things are only getting worse""
You left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church

[Verse 2]
The preacher came by Sunday
Said he missed me at the service
He told me Jesus loves me
But I'm not sure I deserve it
'Cause the faithful man that you loved
Is nowhere to be found
Since they took all that he believed
And laid it in the ground

[Chorus]
And left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church
It used to be so full of faith
And now it only hurts
And I can hear the devil whisper
""Things are only getting worse""
You left my heart as empty
As a Monday morning church

I still believe in Heaven
And I'm sure you've made it there
But as for me without your love, girl
I don't have a prayer

And now it only hurts
And I can hear the devil whisper

[Chorus: Cutty]
What it is ho, what's up
Can a nigga get in them guts
Cut you up like you ain't been cut
Show your ass how to really catch a nut
Well give me you number and I'll call
And I'll follow that ass in the mall
Take you home, let you juggle my balls
While I'm beating and tearing down your walls

[Verse 1: Dirty Mouth]
This your boy Mr. Funkadelic, what's the business baby
I've been eyeing you all day in the mall miss lady
You looking good, I think I seen your ass in the hood
With your friends dressed up, trying to front if you could
But anyway, gone and drop a number or something
So I can call you later on,on your phone or something
Take you home, and maybe we could bone or something
It's no limits to what we do, cause tonight we cutting, gut busting
I'm digging in your walls something viscious
With your legs to the ceiling, catch a nut someting serious
You delirious, or might I say you taste so delicious
With your pretty brown skin, like almond joys and kisses
And you ah certified head doctor
Number one staller that takes dick in the ass and won't holler
Bend you over and I""ll follow you straight to the room
Where it goes down lovely in the Legion of Doom

[Chorus: Cutty]
What it is ho, what's up
Can a nigga get in them guts
Cut you up like you ain't been cut

[Verse 2: Lil LA]
Shit, you know the deal before a nigga even stepped
Damn that ass hot, seems like it's gone melt
You know I give it to you til you run out of breath
Then bust a nut all over yourself
The first time I called, you were juggling on my balls
In and out of your jaws, I was beating down your walls
Had your ass breaking laws for a player was the cause
And every time you seen a G you was slipping off your drawers, I recall
I met your ass at the mall, in the fall
You the one with the dress on, let me take you home
Show your ass how to buss a nut, up in the guts
Cut you up like you ain't been cut
From the back then to the side to the front
Turn around,you got me right
I smack them thighs, anyway that you want me
So gone see about a pimp and that monkey
And that's fo' sho'

What's the buiseness baby, can I get in them drawes
I like the way your hands rub against my balls
Cause you the one, a nigga met at south dekalb mall
With your pretty brown skin, thick thighs and all
135 petite, and your smell is unique
Maybe we can exchange numbers and hook up in the week
Oh, You a freak, I knew it from the first time I saw you
The way you played with your tongue, I knew right then I would call you
So what it is, they call me Super Don from the ville
And I'mma tell you like this, cause a nigga so real, and stay trill
Cause all I wanna do is just drill, with that ass in the air, and the pussy I kill
And I feel, you love to fuck up on a hill
Suck dick from behind, and take nut in your grill
So bitch chill, and shut your mouth just for a second
While I lay this dick down on you just like I'm Teddy

His early morning attitude
You have to drag him out of bed
Only frosted flakes will do

He gets that from me
Yeah, he gets that from me

The way the sun brings those freckles out
Talk and talk and never miss a beat

Yeah, he gets that from me
He gets that from me

[Chorus 1]
He looks at me with those big brown eyes
He's got me in the palm of his hands
And I swear sometimes
It's just like you're here again
He smiles that little crooked smile
There's no denying he's your child
Without him, I don't know what I'd do

[Hook 2]
He gets that from you
Oh, he gets that from you

[Chorus 2]
How he loves your old guitar
Yeah, he's taught himself to play
He melts my heart
Tells me he loves me every day
And cracks a joke at the perfect time
Makes me laugh when I want to cry
That boy is everything to me

[Hook 2]
He gets that from you
He gets that from you

You're a rich girl, and you've gone too far

Cause you know it don't matter anyway
Say money but it won't get you too far

72,Come Home Soon,"[Verse 1]
Never thought I'd be so far from Georgia
Georgia's where I knew I'd always live and die
Now here I am travelin' through Colorado
Livin' on the road, just tryin' to survive

And its been so long since I've felt at home
I've forgotten what it feels like to belong
Anywhere
My woman's scared
I might forget who I am too
If I don't come home soon

Last night I drank until I passed out
In the middle of a crowd of folks I didn't know
I heard 'em laughin' at me lyin' there
Face-down in the dirt, huggin' a telephone pole

[Chorus 2]
Now it's a shame to be
Self-proclaimed free
While trapped by the blindin' symptoms of addiction
At twenty nine
Am I alive?
If I am, I am just barely holdin' on to life

[Bridge]
Music used to be my way to escape
Good to bad and everything between
Now it's become what defines my name
Oh I wonder who it was I used to be
And if I still
Have the will
To finish what I started, right or wrong

[Chorus 1]
God, it's been so long since I've felt at home
I've forgotten what it feels like to be alone
Anywhere
And I'm scared
I might forget who I am too
If I don't come home soon",Brent Cobb,2004,"[75, 75, 75]",3

Tell her I'm sorry, I'm really sorry
Can you forgive me? Please forgive me
And come back home, keep me safe and warm (Yeah!)

With a letterman's jacket and a chevrolet
Thought I was cool
Yea, I ruled the school
You were cumlada with the strawberry lips
Had the whole world danglin' at your fingertips
Your senior year, and I was your daddy's worst fear

We ran off on graduation night
Thought a couple of left-hand rings would make everything alright

Chorus:
With a little bita live, little bita learn
Little bita watchin' a few more candles burn and
Finding out what life was
Oo with a little bita fuss, little bita fight
Littel bita kiss and makin' up all night and
One day waking up
Oh in a real love

Well I was 22 working double overtime
I was spending dollars and making dimes
We were overdrawn, yea and barely hanging on
Then one night you came to me
With tears in your eyes and an EPT and said
""Guess what? Yea baby ready or not""

I just smiled but I was scared to death
How am I gonna have a kid when I'm still a kid myself?

Might even kill somebody and YouTube it
To whoever think their words affect me is too stupid
And if you can do it better than me, then you do it!

Don't talk about style cause I embarrass you
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me 'fore I embarrass you

Around the same time she had fell in love with him

I'm so tired of people telling you I'm doing things
I need you to stop accusing me of playing games

Cause every time I hold you close it's like you ease my pain
You been riding for so long I hope you never change
Just ride with me down this road it ain't no switching lanes
It's like I'm feeling you more each and every day
I ain't letting you go don't you run away

Baby I won't up and leave you straight
I got your back forever I'ma make sure you straight
It's like I'm feeling you more and more every day
I'm asking God is this a blessing he just sent my way
You looking gooder than some cake I call you Anna May
Got her on her tippy-toes like she balleray
She heard I'm creeping with some hoe called Valarey
She thinking something going on she say I'm acting strange
Red Bull I'ma keep you up under my wings
I ain't saying I'm a vet but I'ma keep you tamed
Yellow baby love to squeeze her like lemonade
Running all around my mind like a skating ring
You the golden one you caught my eyes had to make you mine
Say you the chosen one you genuine you be down to ride

Y no van a alcanzar girar a este nivel

Que Bardero$ se va y nadie nos ve volver

Haciendo money a todo horario
Y malgastandola con los chicos del barrio
Solo queremos un aumento de salario
Pa' poder vivir la vida que viven los millonarios
Y mis boys van al frente todo el tiempo, son
Solo salimos en busca de la evolución
Cada cual puede sacar su propia conclusión
Pero saben que esta click es una en un millón
Quieren jugar pero no tengo tiempo
Más, ¿quieren copiar los que les venden, cierto?
No se si lo que hacemos es correcto
Pero deja money, y eso está perfecto
No quiero que me digan lo que ya sabemos
Porque sumar ahora nos cuesta menos
Nos decidimos a ganar el juego
Si en cualquier terreno, nos lo merecemos
Nos vamos siempre pa'l mismo lugar
Pasados de alcohol, cansados de brillar

¿Será por lo que vendemos o por todos esos disparos?
Agarramos si queremos, si queremos lo llevamos
Si llegamos no nos vemos, y si nos vemos le negociamos

[Verse 1: PHZ-Sicks]
Grew up had an obsession
Slick Rick vision with one direction
Jesus piece, give us a blessing
We use to be Kings, it’s in our essences
Dated a girl name Diamond
Being with her I was shining
Popularity started climbing
Gold mining in the field 49ing
With my rhyming and her timing
We found something in her silver sterling lining
My hands on her, every morning
Her Cuban Links to me felt so foreign
We off and on again, arms around me when she wanted something
Niggas would envy, don’t mind is what you told me
When you saw them, you put more of it on me
But her, chain reaction, had me, slanging
With all the money I was bringing, on her I was spending
But girls like her get snatched in the club
Have some niggas fighting and some niggas dying
I’m like is this what I really want to do with my life
Man
My religion became a fashion trend
It’s a shame what pussy whipped niggas will do for a girl’s best friend
I’m done with this whore, I don’t need you no more
I don’t need to know what else you have in store
The gem in my brain will shines more
Materialism, your bags are right next to the door

[Hook]

[Verse 2: PHZ-Sicks]
Next girl I saw, she was rocking them green heels
Her precedence was sexy appeal
Working with looks that could kill
She could come slow, she could come fast
You never knew how long she would last
She picked me up, motivated a nigga
Had me clean, upgraded a nigga
Banked on her when I wanted her
Knew I could always count on her
The type of girl you put a band on
She was the girl everybody want their hands on
When I, had my back turned, she would get her talk on
She had everybody worshipping the very ground she walked on
I didn’t realize Miss Green Eyes, affected so many lives
Made niggas tell many lies, just to get between her thighs
One look could break up a family
Another turn your best friend into an enemy
He was my nino but this g, money have people you know looking at you funny
So, I’m giving you back and when you come back
If you’re doing more bad than good, then girl you have that
You not the end of my world, never was my girl
Love with your moderation, everything will unfurl
Long as I have my health and you not speaking wealth
Then, you can go on and fuck yourself

Why you hurting me so bad?

You’re the best feeling in this world, especially in the last seconds
Every time we start I try to make the best first impression
Whether it’s me or you on top, we won’t stop til we both come out
Repeating each other names like short term memory was our diagnos
But now you got me stuck
I need to go to work (fuck)
Got some things to do (fuck)
Made bad decision cause (fuck)
Getting it right, Doing whatever she like
She’s constantly directing the kid to spike
Cause she got to have it, now I’m an addict
My mind is acting rabid if I can’t tag it
No longer wanna waste my breath
No Hugh Hef for the Lady Macbeths
Some just in my pockets for depth
While some lack depth in that brain dept
They body good and me loving sex
Led to too many women on the deck
Built on faulty foundation, it’s collapsing
Then everybody asking me what happen
I’m done with it, I’m lying, I love sex
But no longer will I let it control my next
Move I make, it’ll turn out great
With a beautiful woman with the mind state
That it’s just the beginning, we in it to win it
And if the world ain’t ready then the best get with it

They can bug my phone and peep around my home

Would give one pause
Nothing about you is false
That's why your love is real
That's why your love is real love
God forbid if you belonged to another
I'd have to steal you
I'd have to take you from your man
I might be tempted to break the law round here
Because your beauty it gives one pause
It slows me down

[Chorus]
I just can't stop writing songs about you
I love you so much
I just can't wait to get my arms around you
And feel your touch
If I don't see you real soon baby girl
I might go insane

99,Suds In The Bucket,"[Verse 1]
She was in the backyard
They say it was a little past nine
When her prince pulled up
A white pick-up truck
Her folks shoulda seen it coming
It was only just a matter of time
Plenty old enough
And you can't stop love
She stuck a note on the screen door
""Sorry, but I got to go""
That was all she wrote
Her mama's heart was broke
That was all she wrote
Or so the story goes

[Chorus 1]
Now her daddy's in the kitchen
Staring out the window
Scratching and a-racking his brains
How could 18 years just up and walk away?
Our little pony-tailed girl
Grown up to be a woman
Now she's gone in the blink of an eye
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hanging out on the line

[Verse 2]
Now, don't you wonder
What the preacher's gonna preach about Sunday morning
Nothing quite like this has happened here before
Well, he must have been a looker
A smooth talking son of a gun
For such a grounded girl to just up and run
Course you can't fence time
And you can't stop love

[Chorus 2]
Now all the biddies in the beauty shop gossip
Going non-stop
Sipping on pink lemonade
How could 18 years just up and walk away?
Our little pony-tailed girl
Grown up to be a woman
Now she's gone in the blink of an eye
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hangin' out on the line
Yee-hoo!

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus 3]
She's got her pretty little bare feet
Hanging out the window
And they're heading up to Vegas tonight
How could 18 years just up and walk away?
Our little pony-tailed girl
Grown up to be a woman
Now she's gone in the blink of an eye
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hanging out on the line
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hanging out on the line

Big chips! Big trips to Vegas, nigga
Big cribs and the whips is spacious (Uh huh)
Any day they could dig your grave
Shit, so big is my inspiration, dig?
No reward unless the risk is taken
In which case you niggas wouldn't wanna switch places
I, on the other hand, relish the situation
Thank the Lord for the gift, I'm gracious
I went overboard, look at this big bracelet
I overhauled it, you wouldn't recognize it
From the time that I bought it, I just replaced it
I risk cases for shit like this
Nigga , I pray for some shit like this
Word to my Uncle Ray, who gave his life for some shit like this

The way you move your ass slow like Matrix
You make me wanna toss chips in Vegas
Before I toss chips, first, get naked
I can't fake it, girl you got the club shut down when you freak it
Superstar honey, so mean and vicious
Got a lot in common, I'm so mean and vicious
Bark bark farmer, this chicken laying platinum ex-farmer (preach!)
So go low mama, give it a go

Must turn up the radio

Out the stretch to the hotel, into the hotel suite!

Tilt my hat and I cross my legs

And the pigeons start flocking, ballin' like Bishop Loughlin
And stick Cochran on any D.A. why try to stop him
So any gunplay, that is an option
I been doing this since niggas was wopping
Rockin Izods with the matching socks, and
Slap boxing in the back park and when the girls start watching
To try to get real, you had to drop 'em
See I ain't never been a fronter
Or fake it 'til I make it type nigga

Either you know what you want ma, or I don't even want ya

Drive cars, no stutter, top floor, no clutter
Hardwood floors though
White wall, that's where my awards go

The light is there

[Intro: Olu Dara singing]
See I come from Mississippi
I was young and runnin' wild
Ended up in New York City, where I had my first child
I named the boy Nasir, all the boys call him Nas
I told him as a youngster, he'll be the greatest man alive

[Verse 1: Nas]
Let's go!...
Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey --
Chuck Berry of these rap skits, styles I mastered
Many brothers snatched it up and tried to match it
But I'm still number one, everyday real
Speak what I want, I don't care what y'all feel
Cause I'm my own master, my Pop told me be your own boss
Keep integrity at every cost, and his home was Natchez Mississippi
Did it like Miles and Dizzy, now we gettin' busy
Bridging the gap, from the blues, to jazz, to rap
The history of music on this track
Born in the game, discovered my father's music
Like Prince searchin' through boxes of Purple Rain
But my Minneapolis was The Bridge, home of the Superkids
Some are well-known, some doin' bids
I mighta ended up on the wrong side of the tracks
If Pops wouldn't've pulled me back an said yo

See I come from Mississippi
I was young and runnin' wild
Ended up in New York City, where I had my first child

I told him as a youngster, he'll be the greatest man alive
Greatest man alive (Yeah, turn it up!)
Gre-Gre-Gre-Gre-Greatest man alive!

[Verse 2: Nas]
The blues came from gospel, gospel from blues
Slaves are harmonizin' them ah's and ooh's
Old school, new school, know school rules
All these years I been voicin' my blues
I'm a artist from the start, Hip-Hop guided my heart
Graffiti on the wall, coulda ended in Spoffard, juvenile delinquent
But Pops gave me the right type'a tools to think with
Books to read, like X and stuff
Cause the schools said the kids had dyslexia
In art class I was a compulsive sketcher of
Teachers in my homeroom, I drew pix to mess them up
Cause none'a them would like my style
Read more books than the curriculum profile
Said, ""Mr. Jones please come get your child
Cause he's writin' mad poems and his verses are wild""

Have you ever been to heaven?
Have you ever seen the gates?
Have you bowed unto your highness?
And do you know how heaven taste? Knock me down

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Arm, leg, leg, arm, head – this is God body
Knowledge, wisdom, freedom, understanding, we just want our equality
Food, clothing, shelter, help a nigga find some peace
Happiness for a gangsta, ain't no love in these streets
Conspiracy theorist screaming Illuminati
They can't believe this much skill is in the human body
He's 6'2"", how the fuck he fit in a new Bugatti?
Aw, fuck it, you got me
Question religion, question it all
Question existence until them questions are solved
Meanwhile this heretic, I be out in Marrakesh
Morocco smoking hashish with my fellowship
Y'all dwell on devil shit, I'm in a Diablo
Yellow shit, color of Jell-O shit
Hello bitch, it's me again
Fresh in my Easter clothes feeling like Jesus and

Losing my religion, losing my religion

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Getting ghost in the Ghost, can you see me? Can you see me?
Have mercy on a Judas, angel wings on a 'ghini
I'm secular, tell the hecklers seckle down
Y'all religion creates division like my Maybach partition
And God is my chauffeur, boy they love Hova
From the south side of Chi to Brooklyn where I growed up
I confess, God in the flesh
Live among the serpents, turn arenas into churches
I'm like Michael, recycle, these are not 16's
These are verses from the Bible
Tell that preacher he's a preacher, I'm a motherfuckin' prophet
Smoke a tree of knowledge, drink from a gold chalice
You gotta love it, I arrive at the pearly gates
I had luggage, meaning I had baggage
Niggas asking me questions, I don't answer to these busters
Only God could judge us, motherfuckers, uh

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Have you ever been to heaven?
Have you ever seen the gates?
Have you bowed unto your highness?
And do you know how heaven taste? Knock me down

She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied

From the time I picked you up, until the time I dropped you off again
Even if flipped out on at the mall again

[Verse 1]
Memories consume
Like opening the wound
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume
I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again

[Pre-Hook]
I don't want to be the one
The battles always choose
'Cause inside I realize
That I'm the one confused

[Hook]
I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way
I know it's not alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit

Clutching my cure
I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more
Than anytime before
I had no options left again

I don't want to be the one
The battles always choose
'Cause inside I realize
That I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way
I'll never be alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit
Tonight

I'll paint it on the walls
'Cause I'm the one at fault
I'll never fight again

Or why I have to scream

Dinner alone, nobody's home, no messages on my telephone
Just pictures hangin up on the wall, oh God, I'm going through withdrawal
Laying in bed with my TV on, but these memories, they won't leave me alone
I guess I'll fall asleep, but then again I won’t, floating in circles, feeling so worthless

[Pre-Hook]
Then the days go by, and nights get longer
I thought the craving stopped, but I still want you
Cause when it's real it never goes away
It only grows much stronger

[Hook]
As the days go by, those days go by, oh uh yeah
Those days go by, oh uh yeah
And it don’t get easier to sleep at night, oh uh yea
Been missing you all this time, as the days go by

[Verse 2]
Who's right or wrong it don’t matter now, I just need you back some way somehow
Sitting here imagining your, your smile, I had no idea, that I’d be right here, wow
All of the moments that we shared, I'll give up everything, I'll buy a wedding ring
Wasn't prepared to not have you here, now I'm floating in circles, feeling so worthless

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Verse 3]
Funny how now is the time I decide I wanna be honest
Our potential is ahead, the regret is so far behind us
And all the BS that I was so good at giving you, was almost criminal, now you sending subliminals
All your friends are defending you, pow wowing against me up in my living room
Running after birds, what a lame choice, maybe I deserve in my Tank voice
Cause all them lames you was curving, I'm observing, you giving time to them same boys
I was living ruthless, but the truth is this last time I ain't even do shit
But like the boy that cried wolf, the time he suppose to win is when he loses

[Verse]
Steady tryin' to maintain
Same things that'll blow a bitch mind frame
My brain can't fathom what the hate say
He say, she say, how 'bout me say?
Get the Vis-a, headed to the islands A-S-A-P
What's that on my shawty wrist? That's a AP
I'm the type to save a bitch, C-A-P-E
Feelin' like ET, flyin' out of the Addy
Fuckin' on shawty, she baddie, casual convo then at it
I mean I'm better than better, maybe I'm lyin'
I'm sadder than most of y'all with the money and the freedom, nigga
What is money really worth if it ain't love?
I'ma find a perfect balance, it's gon' take time
I heard shawty still in love through the grapevine
Heard shawty still in love through the grapevine
Heard shawty in love through the grapevine

Always looking sharp, smooth talker like Alfie
And now pretty women ask us to pick our poison no ivy
Every time that we step on the stage
We fearing nobody we coming in brave
We running a marathon after these goals we'll eventually score
So right now gon' chase it

Like we blazin' a trail, they keeping theirs cold

Yo, primetime quest
Shoes filled taking hometown steps
Dream big is what my grandpops said
Always gain control of what's coming up next
And never get left behind
Staying versatile we're a threat
Got these gentlemen breaking bad
While these suckas breaking a sweat (heavy)
Got that old school drive like Chevy
With an Einstein mindset
From time to time I gotta check myself
Cause I can be one hell of an asset
But, she got one hell of an ass though
Check, 1, 2

Miracles (what)
True blessings (what)
All because of love

True stories (what)
Miracles (what)
True blessings (what)
All because of love

I was riding in my car one day (oh)
In the express lane rolling down the freeway
And suddenly the phone rings
Then I reached down beside me
Then I looked on the floor felt, on the back seat
See I was drinking while I was driving
Never thinking bout what I was doing
I turned around and before I knew it
Here comes this truck now
The doctor said I don't think he's gonna make it
Family said make the funeral arrangements
Unplug the machine he's gone now
Then told my wife to be strong now
Then a small voice said unto me
If you promise to stop drinking
I surrendered on that day
And for 10 years I've been straight

Chorus:
You saved me(woah) You saved me
You saved me, You saved me, gave me a second chance
You saved me, You saved me
You saved me, You saved me

Now I've been sitting in the chair
Waiting on the phone to ring
Praying up to God that someone would call me with a job opening
Cause its been so hard for me month to month
Struggling to eat but still there was no answer(no answer)
I stopped believing in his word And got so mad at him
When somebody say Gods good I just laugh at them(oh yeah)
And in the nick of time his blessing rained on me
By his grace the phone ring a lady says were hiring
And that's when I knew

Chorus:
You saved me(saved) You saved me
You saved me, You saved me, gave me a second chance
You saved me, You saved me
You saved me, You saved me

Now I was 18 out on the block selling drugs
With a gun at my waist And for people had no love
See the streets was my home and family and friends were gone
Had no one to trust and deep inside I was all alone
And then a deal went bad one day and it was enough to pause me
I was shot 4 times and before I knew it I was on my knees
(Blood gushing out my body my hearts beatin fast
I don't know what I'm a do I don't think I'm gonna last)
Then I began to flash back on the thing I've done in my past
(Then I heard a small voice that said to me I'll give you peace if u believe)
I accepted Christ that day hallelujah now I'm free

Chorus:
You saved me(saved) You saved me
You saved me, You saved me, gave me a second chance
You saved me, You saved me
You saved me, You saved me

I was in the aisle of the grocery store
With a pain in my chest and I'm wondering where did it come from
(I got tested)and the results came back and the doctor said I'm sorry but you got cancer
I could not believe it so I called up my mama to calm my nerve
(mama)she got down on her knees (mama)she said a prayer for me
(mama) said just keep on thanking Jesus (mama)he'll give you all you need
That was five years ago don't have that pain no mo
Doc says you can go home cause all your caners gone

You would think that she know me
I decided to chill (okay!)
Conversation got heavy
She had me feeling like she's ready to blow (watch out!)
Ohh! (watch out)

[Verse 2: Usher & Lil Jon]
She's all up in my head now, got me thinking
That it might be a good idea to take her with me
Cause she's ready to leave, ready to leave now (let's go!)
And I got to keep it real now
Cause on a one to ten, she's a certified twenty
But that just ain't me (hey!)

Just where's it gonna lead
But what I do know is the way she dance

So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with their clothes
Then bend over to the front and touch your toes
I left the Jag and I took the Rolls

When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand

Says he wants you, he says he needs you
It's real talk, then why not make him wait for you?
If he really wants you, if he really needs you
Really got to have you
Take your time and feel him out
When he's a good boy, I mean a really, really good boy
Why not let him lay with you?
That's when you give it to him good

[Chorus: Christina Milian]
Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back go
Pop-t, pop-t, pop that thang
I'mma show you how to make your man say, ""Oh""
Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back go
Pop-t, pop-t, pop that thang
I'mma show you how to make your man say, ""Oh""

You're gettin' bold, it’s growin' cold
It's just the symptoms of young love growin' old
You think it's time
Then you're thinkin' of leavin', but give it time
It's late at night, he's comin' home
Meet him at the door with nothin' on
Take him by the hand, let him know it's on
If you understand me, ya'll, come on

All my ladies wind it up if you know just how to move (Ooh, ooh)

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Yeah, uh
Yeah, uh
Baby girl, the way you pop-t, pop-t, pop that thang
I might stop to shop and cop you things
You know I drop the top and hop that thang
Sometimes I stop my bop to pop my thing
You sure know how to make a man say, ""Oh""
And how in the world can a man say, ""No""
When you grind it up on the wall, wind it up like a doll
And you know I Bacardi, lime it up till you fall
Line it up 'till you spoiled
And have those other chicks throwin' vomit up
When they can't find it up in the mall
Like most men, I love to catch up with a model
But I ain't used to movin' slow like ketchup in a bottle
And the best things come to those who wait for it
But I'mma be straight for before it's too late for it
I want you to dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out and make me say, ""Oh""

[Chorus: Christina Milian]
Dip it low, pick it up slow (Slow)
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back go

Dip it low, pick it up slow (You can)
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back go
Pop-t, pop-t, pop that thang
I'mma show you how to make your man say, ""Oh""
Dip it low, pick it up slow (Oh)
Roll it all around, poke it out (Oh) let your back go

The Aunt May and Mary Jane that I was hitting on
To make me try and forget that there was something wrong
Love is Russian roulette, I had the safety on
We popped pills at the Coachella
Hold my head in the weeds, man I can't tell her
The fear that I feel man it might kill her
Man, it might kill her, it's the prep school mic killa'
With the drums and the groove so it feel Dilla

Got shot, came back, jumped on Dre's back

Some call it tricking, go 'head call it what you want
I came to ball, I ain't come out here to front
Cause the black card'll pickup what the grey card won't
Her attractiveness, got me attacking this
Oh so fabulous! Booty is maximus!
She wanna fly south for the winter
I might just go down south just to win her
Hell naw she ain't gon leave me alone
Making plans for us to be at home
Take your pants off ma, you can leave your panties on
But first drop down and get your eagle on, whoa!

I go on and on and on and
Don't take 'em to the crib unless they bonin
Easy, call 'em on the phone and
Platinum Chanel cologne and
I stay dressed to impress
Spark these bitches interest
Sex is all I expect
If they watch TV in the Lex, they know
They know, quarter past 4
Left the club tipsy, say no mo'
Except how I'm gettin home tomorrow
Cease will drop you off when he see his P.O
Back of my mind I hope she swallow
Man she spilled a drink on my cream Wallows
Reach the gate, hungry just ate
Riffin, she got to be to work by eight
This must mean she ain't tryna wait
Conversate, sex on the first date
I state, ""You know what you do to me""
She starts off, ""But I don't usually""
Then I whipped it out, rubber no doubt
Step out, show me what you all about
Fingers in your mouth, open up your blouse
Pull your G-string down South
I threw that back out, in the parking lot
By a Cherokee and a green drop-top
And I don't stop until I squirt
Jeans, skirt, butt-naked - it all work

136,Feels Like Today,"[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning
With this feeling inside me that I can't explain
Like a weight that I've carried been carried away, away
But I know something is coming
I don't know what it is, but I know it's amazing
You save me
My time is coming
And I'll find my way out of this longest drought

[Chorus]
It feels like today, I know
I know it feels like today, I'm sure
It's the one thing that's missing
The one thing I'm wishing
The last sacred blessing, and hey
It feels like today
Feels like today

[Verse 2]
You treat life like a picture
But it's not a moment that's frozen in time
It's not gonna wait 'til you make up your mind, at all
So while this storm is breaking
While there's light at the end of the tunnel
Keep running towards it
Releasing the pressure, that's my heartache
Soon this dam will break

[Chorus]
It feels like today, I know
I know it feels like today, I'm sure
It's the one thing that's missing
The one thing you're wishing
The last sacred blessing, and hey
It feels like today
Feels like today
Oh, oh, oh oh oh
It feels like today, I know
I know it feels like today, I'm sure
It's the one thing that's missing
The one thing I'm wishing
The last sacred blessing, and hey

I'm a dick thrower, her neck and her back hurting
Cut throater, have you like a brand new virgin
It's like when you get used of it then you start serving
Hop up on top and start jicky-jicky-jerking
Slow down for me, a-you moving too fast
My fingers keep slipping, I'm tryna grip that ass
Keep being hard-headed and I'ma make you get on me
Got human enough disguise but my face is a doggy
If you loving my bark let me bury my bone
I got four or five bad married bitches at home
One of my bitches feel in love with that outside dick
That outside dick keep them hoes sick like

It's like I got the world in my palms
Your girl up under my arms, she fucked up from the charm
She love the way the dick stay hard from 12 'til early in the morn'
Fine bitches if you listening, you heard me, I'm strong
If you going through your cycle, I ain't with it, I'm gone
You must have heard about them hoes that I beat up in my home
They wasn't telling the truth baby, you know they was wrong
Now, make it official, wind up some of that dome
I don't mind buying blue, your riding to
Don't be asking nigga questions about where I'm driving you
Lil mama my shit together, I ain't jiving you
I don't think that nigga could do you better then I could do, ya know
And Juvenile from cross the street by the derby
Same nigga that used to be running with Rusty and Kirby
Can a playa from the 'Nolia get a chance with it?
But I can't bounce with you without using my hands with it

Ughh! I like it like that
She working that back, I don't know how to act

Slow motion, she open, I'm hoping she don't leave my dick broken
With brush burns and swollen
I'm toting, she wanted me to make her out a believer
I gurantee ya I'ma see ya when I see ya
And just don't holla out my name like we was all that
Your pussy throw back and you know that
So stop stunting, slow motion for a real nigga
I'm going off that incredible potion and I'ma deal with ya

[Verse 4: Juvenile]
I like how that Victoria Secret sit in that ass
Let me pour some more hip and Hennsey in your glass
Would I be violating if I grab me a handful?

It's going down and happening and I remember the way
Less money we spend on bullshit, the more for the weed
What's it gonna take for you to come slow motion with me?

Running down into the spring that's coming all this love
Melting under blue skies
Belting out sunlight
Shimmering love

Mean we're never alone
Never alone, no, no

Sometimes a mystery, sometimes I'm free
Depending on my mood or my attitude
Sometimes I wanna roll or stay at home
Walking contradiction, guess I’m factual and fiction

Little rough around the edges but I keep it smooth
I’m always left of center and that’s right where I belong
I’m the random minor note you hear in major songs

And I like that
I don’t really give a fuck if I was just the only one
Who likes that
I never like to follow, follow, I would rather chase the sun
Oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my
Oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my
Oh me, oh me, oh me, oh my

Better than amazing, and better than I could

Right before Mr. Ammond’s class

Do you remember?
Uh, I remember when you laughed when I cut my perm off
And you rated me a six

But even back then with the tears in my eyes
I always knew I was the shit

144,You & Me,"[Verse 1: Marc E. Bassy]
Girl you party all the time
Don't let me stay on your mind
Adderall and cheap wine
Just to stay awake in conversation
We were always so damn insecure
So how could we ever know for sure
And disregard the way I know we feel
That would make this city way too real

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me
We’re just strangers in passing casually
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me

[Verse 2: Marc E. Bassy]
The shirt on my back with the rips
Gems in my golden necklace
You didn't give me none of this
There's nothing for me to miss
We were too young on the day we met
How could we say we would not forget
And in the shadows there's a place for us
Somewhere hidden they can't find our love
Don't let 'em know

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me
We’re just strangers in passing casually
It’s not us no more
It’s just you and me

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Eazy, and these days it's just you and me
This shit is dead and gone, it's not what it used to be
Someone give a eulogy
Know I'm hard headed and I might of acted foolishly
But you the one to hold us down usually
We was in a limbo
But of all people you ain't have to fuck with him though
That was my homie I had gave y'all the intro
Some things fall apart and some get thrown out the window
Remember when we first met we might've been too young
But we was from The Bay so we both was going too dumb
I used to be the one for you now you got a new one
So till the next lifetime, maybe we can do some'n
Eazy

146,Too Much Of A Good Thing,"[Intro]
She's 'bout that life. She's 'bout that life. Too much of a good thing. Too much of a good thing. Too much of a good thing. Yo

[Hook - Larina]
She's 'bout that life she twerks her body
She likes to be life of the party
So we keep coming back with more and more gifts
She likes to flirt, stay out and party
So I say, ""Cool, don't hurt nobody.""
But she keep coming back with more and more chips

[Verse 1]
Boy meets girl
Girl likes boy on girl on girl
And it's our world
She be bringing dimes home, this our swirl
Having fun since we was younger
Competing, who can get the most numbers
Them other girls don't come between us
Unless we make her cum in-between us
She say I keep her satisfied
Bad bitch and she fucking with a badder guy
But then she started doing her excluding me
Walked in the bedroom like ""Who is she?""
Life with an exotic dancer
Arguing like Sway and Kanye, you ain't got the answers
Can't commit and I hate the shit
How do you close an open relationship?

[Hook]
She's 'bout that life she twerks her body
She likes to be life of the party
So we keep coming back with more and more gifts
She likes to flirt, stay out and party
So I say, ""Cool, don't hurt nobody.""
But she keep coming back with more and more chips


[Verse 2]
A leopard can't change his spots
Could I ever be faithful when you forever not?
Cross your heart and hope to die
You say it ain't cheating cause I know you bi
See at first we was having fun
But now you having too much and I'm not having none
Why do I get upset?
Coming home with fucking hickys on your neck
Lipstick on your dress
I'm sure she was hot, but I don't wanna hear the rest
They say sharing is caring
So start caring, share Emily and Sharon
Double standard, some other girl
And you don't want me with no other girl
Unless you there too
But that ain't fair boo

[Hook]
She's 'bout that life she twerks her body
She likes to be life of the party
So we keep coming back with more and more gifts

I hold on to my pillow tight
And think of how you promised me forever

Could make me feel this way, oh
(Now that you're here, boy, all I want)

But you was just a waste of time (waste of time)

Tell me why you're looking so confused
When I'm the one who didn't know the truth
How could you ever be so cold?
To go behind my back and call my friend
Boy, you must have gone and bumped your head
Because you left her number on your phone

I know He hear me when my feet get weary
'Cause we're the almost nearly extinct

I ain't here to argue about His facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just tryna say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single, dawg, radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, videotape
But if I talk about God my record won't get played, huh?
Well if this take away from my spins
Which'll probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreamin' about
Next time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out

150,Live Like You Were Dying,"[Verse 1]
Said I was in my early 40's
With a lot of life before me
When a moment came that stopped me on a dime
I spent most of the next days, lookin' at the x-rays
Talkin' 'bout the options and talkin' 'bout sweet time
Asked him when it sank in
That this might really be the real end
How's it hit ya, when you get that kind of news
Man what ya do
And he says

[Chorus 1]
I went sky divin'
I went Rocky Mountain climbin'
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I've been denying
And he said someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'

[Verse 2]
He said I was finally the husband
That most the time I wasn't
And I became a friend a friend would like to have
And all the sudden goin' fishing
Wasn't such an imposition
And I went three times that year I lost my dad
Well I finally read the good book
And I took a good long hard look at what I'd do
If I could do it all again
And then

[Chorus 1]
I went sky divin'
I went Rocky Mountain climbin'
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I gave forgiveness I've been denying
And he said someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'

[Bridge]
Like tomorrow was a gift and you've got eternity
To think about what you do with it
What could you do with it, what can
I do with with it, what would I do with it

[Chorus 2]
Sky divin'
I went Rocky Mountain climbin'
I went 2.7 seconds on a bull named Fu Manchu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter
And I watched an eagle as it was flying
And he said someday I hope you get the chance
To live like you were dyin'

151,I Go Back,"[Verse 1]
""Jack and Diane"" painted a picture of my life and my dreams
Suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me
Well I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
Because every time I hear that song

[Chorus]
I go back to a two toned short bed Chevy
Driving my first love out to the levee
Living life with no sense of time
And I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
Wishing time would stop right in its tracks
Every time I hear that song, I go back
I go back

[Verse 2]
I used to rock all night long to ""Keep On Rocking Me Baby""
Frat parties, college bars, just trying to impress the ladies
Well I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
Because every time I hear that song

[Chorus]
And I go back to the smell of an old gym floor
And the taste of salt on a Carolina shore
After graduation and drinking goodbye to friends
And I go back to watchin summer fade to fall
Growin up too fast and I do recall
Wishin time would stop right in its tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back
I go back

[Bridge]
We all have a song that somehow stamped our lives
Takes us to another place and time

[Chorus]
So I go back to a pew, preacher, and a choir
Singing bout God, brimstone, and fire
And the smell of Sunday chicken after church
And I go back to the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
Now ""Only The Good Die Young"" stops me in my tracks
Every time I hear that song
I go back

[Verse 3]
I go back
To the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
I go back (I go back)
To watching summer fade to fall
Growing up too fast and I do recall

152,Confessions Part II,"[Intro]
Watch this

[Chorus]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions

[Verse 1]
Now, this gon' be the hardest thing I think I ever had to do
Got me talking to myself, asking how I'm gon' tell you
'Bout that chick on part one I told y'all I was creeping with, creeping with
Said she's three months pregnant and she's keeping it
The first thing that came to mind was you
Second thing was how do I know if it's mine and is it true
Third thing was me wishing that I never did what I did
How I ain't ready for no kid and bye bye to our relationship

[Chorus]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions

[Verse 2]
Sitting here, stuck on stupid, trying to figure out
When, what, and how I'ma let this come out of my mouth
Said it ain't gon' be easy
But I need to stop thinking, contemplating
Be a man and get it over with, over with
I'm riding in my whip, racing to her place
Talking to myself, preparing to tell her to her face
She open up the door and didn't want to come near me
I said ""one second, baby, please hear me""

[Chorus]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions

[Interlude]
This by far is the hardest thing I think I've ever had to do
To tell you, the woman I love
That I'm having a baby by a woman that I barely even know
I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this
And hopefully you'll give me another chance
This ain't about my career
This ain't about my life
It's about us
Please

153,U Should've Known Better,"[Verse 1]
I didn't ask to go with you to Mexico
I really didn't need the shopping spree in LA or Melrose
Boy, if you didn't know it, well, now you know
I didn't need the furs or the jewelry
Because material things, it don't mean much to me
And ever since you've been gone
I've been holding us down, on my own and no, ...

[Pre-Chorus]
I never ever cheated, I never ever lied
So you can stop askin', askin' me why
Why I never left you
And why I kept it real
And why I'm still with you

[Chorus]
You should've known better
Than to think I would leave
You should've known better
Than to doubt me (me)
It don't matter if you're up
Matter if you're down
Either way, I'm gonna be around
You should've known that
I would stay by your side
Should've known your girl
Was gonna ride or die
And it just don't matter
If you're rich or poor, out or in doin' 5 to 10
You should've known better

[Verse 2]
What makes you think
That I would forget about ya?
Think about it, who comes to see ya?
Every Saturday and Monday I was on that receiver
It's me (me) your girl (girl), your life (life), your world (world)
My family and friends, they just don't understand
They say, I should leave you alone
But I say, that they all should just leave us alone
Don't you get it?

For 48 hours, I don't think that we left my hotel room
Should show you the sights 'cause I'm sure that I said that I would
We gotta make love just one last time in the shower

157,Whiskey Lullaby,"[Verse 1: Brad Paisley]
She put him out
Like the burning end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart
He spent his whole life tryin' to forget
We watched him drink his pain away
A little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough
To get her off his mind
Until the night...

[Chorus: Brad Paisley & Alison Krauss ]
He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short, but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said, ""I'll love her 'til I die""
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The Angels sang a whiskey lullaby

Until the night...

She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away his memory
Life is short, but this time it was bigger

I saved every letter you wrote me
From the moment I read them
I knew you were mine
You said you were mine
I thought you were mine

Do you know what Angelica said
When we saw your first letter arrive?
She said

“Be careful with that one, love
He will do what it takes to survive.”

You and your words flooded my senses
Your sentences left me defenseless
You built me palaces out of paragraphs
You built cathedrals
I’m re-reading the letters you wrote me
I’m searching and scanning for answers
In every line
For some kind of sign
And when you were mine
The world seemed to

Burn
Burn

You published the letters she wrote you
You told the whole world how you brought
This girl into our bed
In clearing your name, you have ruined our lives
Do you know what Angelica said
When she read what you’d done?
She said
“You have married an Icarus
He has flown too close to the sun.”

You and your words, obsessed with your legacy...
Your sentences border on senseless
And you are paranoid in every paragraph
How they perceive you

You, you, you…

I’m erasing myself from the narrative
Let future historians wonder how Eliza
Reacted when you broke her heart
You have torn it all apart
I am watching it
Burn
Watching it burn
The world has no right to my heart
The world has no place in our bed
They don’t get to know what I said
I’m burning the memories
Burning the letters that might have redeemed you
You forfeit all rights to my heart
You forfeit the place in our bed
You sleep in your office instead
With only the memories
Of when you were mine

Mile marker 203
The gas gauge leanin' on the edge of E
And I'll be danged if the rain ain't pouring down
There's something smoking underneath the hood
It's a bangin' and a clangin' and it can't be good
And it's another 50 miles to the nearest town
Everything I own's in the back in a Hefty bag
I'm outta cigarettes and I'm down to my last drag

[Chorus]
I'd sure hate to break down here
Nothing up ahead or in the rearview mirror
Out in the middle of nowhere, knowin'
I'm in trouble if these wheels stop rollin'
So God help me, keep me moving somehow
Don't let me start wishing I was with him now
I made it this far without crying a single tear
I'd sure hate to break down here

[Verse 2]
Under fifty thousand miles ago
Before the bad blood and busted radio
You said I was all you'd ever need
But love is blind and little did I know
You were just another dead-end road
Paved with pretty lies and broken dreams
Baby, leaving you is easier than being gone
I don't know what I'll do if one more thing goes wrong

[Chorus]
I'd sure hate to break down here
Nothing up ahead or in the rearview mirror
Out in the middle of nowhere, knowin'
I'm in trouble if these wheels stop rollin'
So God help me, keep me moving somehow
Don't let me start wishing I was with him now
I made it this far without crying a single tear
I'd sure hate to break down here

Oh, no...

I'd sure hate to break down here
Nothing up ahead or in the rearview mirror
Out in the middle of nowhere, knowin'
I'm in trouble if these wheels stop rollin'
So God help me, keep me moving somehow
Don't let me start wishing I was with him now

Hold me close, nose be ope
How much evil can dough provoke
How much she told me nope
'Cause this one was on her
I'm hoping I can get the chance to put it on her
She slithered on me, put the booty in my lap and got to gyrating
Was I waiting for the pushing, grabbing and vibrating
But this is really when my pupils got to dilating
What kind of magical hocus pocus was I facing
Over and over tried to explain it the best that I could
She put the mouth on the crotch of my pants and said
Hgrrrrrr

I'm going to rip out the guts and try to throw my hip out
Now it's time to trip out, got at the bitch house
Was three fine female roommates my homies missed out
Took me to her room and threw me right on the bed
Got right on the head, what a wonderful night it was said
Then along came three 36 double D's
Sizes kissing and licking on me
And they coming to do what? Wake my dude up
But one of them bitches bit me on the neck and drew blood
Then the other and the others
Instead of bud lovers I'm trapped with blood sucking motherfuckers for eternity
Brought me here to straight feed on a nigga
All because I said to a stripper

173,On Fire,"[Intro]
You know, critics, man
Critics never got nothin' nice to say, man
You know, the one thing I notice about critics, man
Is critics never ask me how my day went
Well, I'ma tell 'em

[Verse 1]
Augh, yesterday my dog died
I hog tied a ho, tied her in a bow
Said: ""Next time you blog, try to spit a flow.""
You wanna criticize, dog? Try a little mo'
I'm so tired of this I could blow, fire in the hole
I'm fired up, so fire up the lighter and the dro
Better hold on a little tighter, here I go
Flows tighter, hot-headed as Ghost Rider
Cold-hearted as Spider-Man throwing a spider in the snow
So you better get lower than Flo-rida
Inside of a lowrider with no tires, in a hole
Why am I like this? Why is winter cold?
Why is it when I talk I'm so biased to the hoes?
Listen, dog, Christmas is off, this is as soft as it gets
This isn't golf, this is a blistering assault
Those are your wounds, this is the salt, so get lost
Shit, dissin' me is just like pissin' off the Wizard of Oz
Wrap a lizard in gauze
Beat you in the jaws with it, grab the scissors and saws
And cut out your livers, gizzards, and balls
Throw you in the middle of the ocean in a blizzard with Jaws
So sip piss like sizzurp through a straw
Then describe how it tasted like dessert to us all
Got the gall to make Chris piss in his drawers
Tickle him, go to his grave, skip him, and visit his dog

[Chorus]
(You're on fire) That's how you know you're on a roll
'Cause when you're hot it's like you're burning up everyone else's cold
(You're on fire) Man, I'm so fuckin' sick
I got ambulances pullin' me over and shit
(You're on fire) You need to stop, drop, and roll
'Cause when you say the shit to get the whole hip-hop shop to blow
(You're on fire)
(You're on fire)

[Verse 2]
I just put a bullshit hook in between two long-ass verses
If you mistook this for a song, look, this ain't a song
It's a warning to Brooke Hogan and David Cook
That the crook just took over, so book
Run as fast as you can, stop writing and kill it
I'm lightning in a skillet, you're a fuckin' flash in the pan
I pop up, you bitches scatter like hot grease splashing a fan
Mr. Mathers is the man, yeah, I'm pissed
But I would rather take this energy and stash it in a can
Come back and whip your ass with it again
Saliva's like sulfuric acid in your hand
It'll eat through anything, metal, the ass of Iron Man
Turn him into plastic
So for you to think that you could stand a fuckin' chance is asinine
Yeah, ask Denaun, man
Hit a blind man with a coloring book
And told him color inside the lines or get hit with a flying crayon
Fuck it, I ain't playin', pull up in a van
And hop out on a homeless man holding a sign sayin'
""Vietnam vet"", I'm out my fuckin' mind, man
Kick over the can, beat his ass, and leave him nine grand
So if I seem a little mean to you
This ain't savage, you ain't never seen a brute
You wanna get graphic, we can go the scenic route
You couldn't make a bulimic puke
On a piece of fuckin' corn and peanut poop
Sayin' you sick, quit playin', you prick, don't nobody care
And why the fuck am I yellin' at air
I ain't even talkin' to no one, 'cause ain't nobody there
And nobody will fuckin' test me
'Cause these hoes won't even dare
I'm wasting punchlines, but I got so many to spare
I just thought of another one that might go here
Nah, don't waste it, save it, psycho—yeah
Plus you got to rewrite those lines
That you said about Michael's hair (Woops!)

[Chorus]
(You're on fire) That's how you know you're on a roll
'Cause when you're hot it's like you're burning up everyone else's cold
(You're on fire) Man, I'm so hot
My motherfuckin' firetruck's on fire, homie

Well, I walk into the room
Passing out hundred dollar bills
And it kills and it thrills like the horns on my Silverado grill
And I buy the bar a double round of  Crown
And everybody's getting down
An' this town ain't never gonna be the same

[Chorus:]
Cause I saddle up my horse
And I ride into the city

They are so pretty

Save a horse, ride a cowboy

Save a horse, Ride a cowboy

Well I don't give a dang about nothing
I'm singing and Bling-Blinging
While the girls are drinking
Long necks down!
And I wouldn't trade ol' Leroy
Or my Chevrolet for your Escalade
Or your freak parade
I'm the only John Wayne left in this town

[Spoken:]
I'm a thourough-bred
That's what she said
In the back of my truck bed
As I was gettin' buzzed on suds
Out on some back country road
We where flying high
Fine as wine, having ourselves a big and rich time
And I was going, just about as far as she'd let me go

But her evaluation
Of my cowboy reputation
Had me begging for salvation
All night long
So I took her out giggin frogs
Introduced her to my old bird dog
And sang her every Wilie Nelson song I could think of
And we made love

And I saddled up my horse
And I ride into the city
I make a lot of noise
Cause the girls
They are so pretty
Riding up and down Broadway
On my old stud Leroy
And the girls say
Save a horse, ride a cowboy

We were both sixteen and it felt so right
Sleepin' all day, stayin' up all night

There's a place on the corner of Cherry Street
We would walk on the beach in our bare feet
We were both eighteen and it felt so right
Sleepin' all day, stayin' up all night

If I could find you now things would get better
We could leave this town and run forever
Let your waves crash down on me
And take me away

There's a piece of you that's here with me
It's everywhere I go, it's everything I see
When I sleep, I dream and it gets me by
I can make believe that you're here tonight
That you're here tonight

If I could find you now things would get better
We could leave this town and run forever
I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together
Let your waves crash down on me
And take me away

I remember the look in your eyes
When I told you that this was goodbye
You were beggin' me not tonight
Not here, not now
We're looking up at the same night sky
And keep pretendin' the sun will not rise
We'll be together for one more night

So I changed, huh? You got a phone
Pick it up, call me

[Chorus: Eminem]
How come we don't even talk no more
And you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine we even beefing now
After all the years we've been down
Ain't no way, no how, this bullshit can't be true
We family, ain't a damn thing changed unless it's you

[Verse 1: Eminem]
We were so young so full of life and vibrance
Side by side, wherever you was riding, I went
So close, almost on some Bonnie and Clyde shit
When Ronnie died you was right by my side
With a shoulder to cry on and tissue to wipe my eyes
And a bucket to catch every tear I cried inside it
You even had the same type of childhood I did
Sometimes I just wanna know why is it that you succame to yours
And mine I survived it. You ran the streets, I 9 to 5ed it
We grew up, grew apart as time went by us
And I blew up to both yours and mines surprises
Now I feel a vibe I just can't describe it
Much as your pride tries to hide it your cold your touch is just like ice
And your eyes is a look of resentment I can sense it and I don't like it

[Chorus: Eminem]
How come we don't even talk no more, and you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all, and I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine we even beefing now
After all the years we've been down
Ain't no way, no how, this bullshit can't be true
We family, ain't a damn thing changed unless it's you

It was my dream at first to be off spitting a verse
On my own album with a deal but shit got worse
'Fore I came out I woulda killed a nigga first
For I let him disrespect me, or check me over some worrisome
Bitch that I wasn't with I woulda hit it and quit
But you were planning to talk with her and tell her she was the shit
I told you don't get involved with her you would smoke in the car with her
Coming outta the bar with her stumbling half drunk
Like y'all was husband and wife or something
But me catching her fucking other niggas musta hurt your pride or something
Cause you woof off at the mouth to people like you want it with me
When all I tried to do was show that your bitch was shifty
And ever since the fans and all the shit that I produced
You acting like I ain't your man and lying like she can't be loose
But I am really your friend, I'm just trying to tell ya the truth
Don't hate the game or the player the one that's changing is you

[Chorus: Eminem]
How come we don't even talk no more, and you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all, and I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine we even beefing now
After all the years we've been down
Ain't no way, no how, this bullshit can't be true
We family, ain't a damn thing changed unless it's you

[Verse 3: Proof & Eminem]
It gets lonely at the top cause my homie had to stop
Now we acting like I gotta live only for the block
And homies in the hood only see me on the tube
So they gossip on the porch get to speaking all rude
Fools I used to rap wit all expect magic
Like my finger get to snapping and poof it just happen
But Proof is just acting out the part he was thrown
Shady made it so my babies ain't starving at home
See the devil in your glance since the ghetto we been friends
Forever real intelligence that's forever till the end
I peep the hatred in your eyes, and the Satan in your lies
Ain't wasting my time with these snakes in disguise
(HOW COME) When you talk it's with bitter and spite?
(AND HOW COME) It's my fault for what you did with your life?
And every time I go to hear you play, you look away
We barely embrace, you can't even look me in my face

[Chorus: Eminem]
How come we don't even talk no more, and you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all, and I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine we even beefing now

«Где ты, когда ты не онлайн, когда я жду тебя в сети?
В какие ссылки перейти, чтоб просто оказаться там?
О чём ты думаешь сейчас? Давай среди берёз густых
Читать любимый твой рассказ — страничку я, страничку ты
Или в гости и просто чаю, и сердцами WhatsApp закидан»
Но я снова не отвечаю. Я инкогнито — инкогнида
Но если б мне платили, милый, каждый раз, когда взгляд твой дымный

И тебя не жаль, не жаль, не жаль. Хоть слоу-мо в дыме сигарет
Даже в миноре и под рояль, даже под грустную скрипку - нет
Если б ты не любил стихи, превратилась бы в звонкий ямб
Если б был наркотою ты, фитоняшкой бы стала я

Если б мне платили каждый раз

Don't even do that, I know why you cryin' (Stop cryin')
I'm not applyin' no pressure, just wanna let you know
That I don't wanna let you go (I don't wanna let you go)
And I don't wanna let you leave
Can't say I didn't let you breathe
Gave you extra cheese (C'mon), put you in the SUV
You wanted ice so I made you freeze
Made you hot like the West Indies (That's right)
Now it's time you invest in me
Cause if not then it's best you leave

When you hold me in the street
And you kiss me on the dance floor
I wish that it could be like that
Why can't it be like that? Cause I'm yours

[Verse 1: Jade Thirlwall & Jesy Nelson]
We keep behind closed doors
Every time I see you, I die a little more
Stolen moments that we steal as the curtain falls
It'll never be enough
It's obvious you're meant for me
Every piece of you, it just fits perfectly
Every second, every thought, I'm in so deep
But I'll never show it on my face

[Pre-Chorus: Jesy Nelson]
But we know this, we got a love that is hopeless

When you're with him, do you call his name
Like you do when you're with me? Does it feel the same?
Would you leave if I was ready to settle down?
Or would you play it safe and stay?

What's it going to be?
I tell him man

Just sitting there singing every song on the radio

184,I Believe,"[ELDER PRICE]
Ever since I was a child, I tried to be the best...
So what happened?
My family and friends all said I was blessed...
So what happened?

It was supposed to be all so exciting, to be teaching of Christ 'cross the sea
But I allowed my faith to be shaken – oh, what's the matter with me?
I've always longed to help the needy, to do the things I never dared
This was the time for me to step up, so then why was I so scared?

A warlord who shoots people in the face – what's so scary about that?
I must trust that my Lord is mightier and always has my back
Now I must be completely devout; I can't have even one shred of doubt!

I believe that the Lord God created the universe
I believe that he sent his only son to die for my sins
And I believe that ancient Jews built boats and sailed to America
I am a Mormon!
And a Mormon just believes

You cannot just believe part-way, you have to believe in it all
My problem was doubting the Lord's will, instead of standing tall
I can't allow myself to have any doubt, it's time to set my worries free
Time to show the world what Elder Price is about, and share the power inside of me!

I believe that God has a plan for all of us
I believe that plan involves me getting my own planet
And I believe that the current President of the Church, Thomas Monson, speaks directly to God
I am a Mormon!
And, dang it, a Mormon just believes! (A Mormon just believes!)

I know that I must go and do the things my God commands (Things my God commands!)
I realize now why he sent me here!
If you ask the Lord in faith, he will always answer you
Just believe in him and have no fear

[UGANDAN SOLDIER]
(General! We have an intruder! He just walked right into camp!)

[ELDER PRICE]
I believe that Satan has a hold of you
I believe that the Lord God has sent me here!
And I believe that in 1978 God changed his mind about black people! (Black people!)
You can be a Mormon!
A Mormon who just believes...

[GENERAL BUTT-FUCKING NAKED]
(The fuck is this?)

[ELDER PRICE]
And now I can feel the excitement: this is the moment I was born to do
And I feel so incredible to be sharing my faith with you
The scriptures say that if you ask in faith, if you ask God himself, you'll know
But you must ask him without any doubt, and let your spirit grow! (Let your spirit grow!)

I believe that God lives on a planet called Kolob!
I believe that Jesus has his own planet as well
And I believe that the Garden of Eden was in Jackson County, Missouri


If you believe, the Lord will reveal it
And you'll know it's all true – you'll just feel it
You'll be a Mormon!
And, by gosh, a Mormon just believes
(A Mormon just believes)

(Just believe, a Mormon just believes)
Oh, I believe! (Just believe, a Mormon just...)

Even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
Even the shooters can get shot
Uhh

[Verse 1]
Tell em I got plenty arson to sell em
Heat by the fleet displaying it very seldomly
I write till I ignite my cerebellum
Close to the pen like I had 3 felons
Come from a city where niggas show no remorse
And a corpse is just another hommy taking it's course
Of course my dream was to play in the Final Four
Till the twelfth grade came and I was only 5'4
So now I'm a graduate looking to get hired
My pops knew a security job he inquired
But ignorance is bliss, that's what I was told
I stopped, dropped and rolled when somebody yelled fired
Now there goes another black boy unemployed
With a lot of free time which means he's vulnerable to run into a lot of crime
I wrote it in my rhymes
And when I left the porch this is what I realized

(Chorus)
Even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
Even the shooters can get shot (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
Even the shooters can get shot (yeah, yeah, yeah, wassup?)
These streets ain't none to play with
It could get outrageous
Got burners, .45's and gauges
That could really get outrageous

[Verse 2]
So I'm thinking to myself, what's next?
My security job only got me like 2 checks
My pops disappointed, told me I'm fuckin' up
Irresponsible and I need some growing up
I told him I would go back, knowing I wouldn't go back
Working a 9 to 5 is something I couldn't stomach
Surrounded by the violence
All the goons and the goblins
With 99 problems I still kept it 100
These streets can be rather manipulating
Especially when you're black and just turned 18
So what's a kid to do, when your fresh out of school and the negatives of the world constantly following you?
Not to mention a local henchman, copped a sheriff's part like terrorists
Osama with badges that talk arrogant
That boy 15 and he holdin' a .45
30 years apart, 30 years before he realized

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Uhh
Soon as the beat drop, I bet some heat pop
On a block close to you like a relative
You sippin' Belvedere while these niggas plannin' to rob Mr. Belvedere
Yeah I'm a good kid tryna stay righteous as Martin Luther but it seems like all of my friends eventually become shooters
And niggas bangin' on you is something that you'll get used to
You can either fight back or run home and grab your ruger
Whatever you do just make sure you're willing to do it
Being too indecisive can get you killed inside your Buick
Cuz you stopped at the light, 5 minutes from midnight
With no tinted windows that nigga surely had shot through it
You tell me you listening, but you don't hear the music
Call you Billy Hoyle when turmoil was near
This is the realest right here
When I lost my very first job
My pops said why?
I said I couldn't aim for the sky
Cuz even shooters can get shot

A little conversation goes a long, long way
Show a little patience
That you are here to stay
So show me that you're game, oh

You're dangerous, just get it up
The way you move so scandalous
It's all about the two of us
A one night stand just ain't enough
I need some stimulation, baby
A little conversation maybe
You got me spinning 'round like crazy
There goes my baby
You're dangerous, just get it up
The way you move so scandalous
It's all about the two of us
A one night stand just ain't enough
I need some stimulation, baby

[Verso 1: Luis Angel Gómez Jaramillo]
Que el cielo no es azul
Ay, mi amor; ay, mi amor
Que es rojo dices tú
Ay, mi amor; ay, mi amor
Ves todo al revés
Ay, mi amor; ay, mi amor
Creo que piensas con los pies
Ay, mi amor; ay, mi amor

Tú me traes un poco loco, un poquititito loco
Estoy adivinando qué quieres y pa' cuándo
Y así estoy celebrando
Que me he vuelto un poco loco

Chiflado tú me vuelves, eso está un poco loco
Tu mente que despega, tú siempre con ideas
Con mi cabeza juegas, todo es un poco loco

191,If You Ever Stop Loving Me,"My old man's backhand used to land
Hard on the side of my head
I just learned to stay out of his way
There been street fights, blue lights, long nights
With the world sittin' on my chest
It just showed me how much I can take
Hard times, bad luck
Sometimes life sucks

That's alright
I'm okay
It ain't nothin' but another day
But only God knows where I'd be
If you ever stop lovin' me

The bank man, the bossman, the law man
All tryin' to get their hands on me
And I ain't even done a damn thing wrong
I've been way-laid, freight trained, short changed
By bigger and badder men
And all I've got to say is ""bring it on""
Hard rain, rough roads, so my life goes

That's alright
I'm okay
It ain't nothin' but another day
But only God knows where I'd be
If you ever stop loving me

I need you
Gotta have you
In my life, by my side
Every day I'm alive
Every night that I'm breathin'
I'm needin' you

So everybody know he love white people

And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwind
And I’ll never let him ever hit the telethon
I mean, even if people dyin’ and the world ends
See, I just want him to have an easy life, not like Yeezy life
Just want him to be someone people like
Don’t want him to be hated all the time, judged
Don’t be like your daddy that'd never budge
And I’ll never let him ever hit a strip club
I learned the hard way, that ain’t the place to get love
And I’ll never let his mom move to LA

My only job is cut the time in half

Look a man dead in his eyes
So he know you talk truth when you speak it
Give your word, keep it
And if the day comes I only see him on the weekend
I just pray we was in love on the night that we conceived him
Promise to never leave him even if his mama tweakin’

Never repeat him, never repeat him

I'm just the girl next door

[Chorus 2]
Hey, I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raising
I say ""hey, y'all"" and ""yee-haw""
And I keep my Christmas lights on
On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Tanya Tucker song
So here's to all my sisters
Out there keeping it country
Let me get a big ""hell yeah"" from the redneck girls like me
Hell yeah (Hell yeah!)

[Chorus 3]
I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raising
I say ""hey, y'all"" and ""yee-haw""

And I keep my Christmas lights on
On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Ol' Bocephus song
So here's to all my sisters
Out there keeping it country
Let me get a big ""hell yeah"" from the redneck girls
Like me

201,Hey Mama,"[Chorus]
(Hey Mama)
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me
(Hey Mama)

[Verse 1]
I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine and I'm finna let it shine
I'm finna take y'all back to them better times
I'm finna talk about my mama if y'all don't mind
I was three years old when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that, mommy, can't you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
'Cause a nigga cheatin', telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy I'ma love you 'til you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'ma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford
See you're unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that's makin' loot
A livin' legend too, just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel, and I thank you (Hey Mama)

[Chorus]
(Hey Mama)
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do

I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me
(Hey Mama)

[Verse 2]
Forrest Gump mama said, ""Life is like a box of chocolates""
My mama told me go to school, get your doctorate
Somethin to fall back on, you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you
You was getting through, can the choir, please
Give me a verse of ""You Are So Beautiful To Me""
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou, Nikki Giovanni, turn one page and there's my mommy
Come on mommy just dance wit' me, let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say Hey, y'all say, Mama, now everybody answer me (Hey Mama)

[Chorus]
(Hey Mama)
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do

I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me

[Bridge]
I guess it also depends though if my ends low
Second, they get up you gon get that Benzo
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let ya friends know (Hey Mama)

[Verse 3]
Tell your job you gotta fake em out
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out
To a restaurant, upper echelon
I'ma get you a Jag, whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday
For me to just call and say: (Hey Mama)

[Chorus]
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey Mama)
You know I love you so
I never let you go
Wrote this song just so you know
No matter where you go our love is true

I see the girls in the club, they gettin' wild for me
And all the pretty chicks all wanna smile at me
These rap cats man they all got they style from me
And if I ever seen them then they probably bow to me
And when this beat - drop I know they gon' lean
World debut, I know they gon' fiend
Everything, Mississippi to the Palm Springs
Girls from brunettes down to blonde queens
These young boys don't know what a don mean
I'm just a bad boy gone clean
I'm the diamond chain choker, always remain sober
Don't drink liquor and all the games over
Need a plane, I explain it to my broker
Three bots in the hood top down, it ain't nova (My homie)
You know there's more man where that come from
Me and Kunta Love rollin' back to back in one

See I rep the most high, still I'm the most fly
Win so much, they wanna know who I'm coached by
Everyday approached by chicks when I was on top
Wanna give me sosa, but I'm like don't try
I see the hisses and the disses when I go by
But see the misses on my wristses when I float by
Self control, and I can't tell you no lie
Tryin' to find a soulmate, you end up being so tired
I make my money man without the coca
Livin' the vida without the loca
I'm down south so they show me country love
And I ain't even country thug
The people give me daps and hugs, so it must be love
And I love the country grub
It feel good to hear people singing welcome back
And I ain't even sellin' the track, cause I'm that Harlem cat

[Verse 1]
I know your tears more than you cause I see them so much
That's what happens when you're here with no trust
Okay, I lied, cheated, you cried
You done worse shit and I'm still here right
And motherfuck your friends, all them hoes hating
If you're not down then what's your location
I called and checked in every night and that was not probation
They gave they two cents and we ain't ask for no donation
Man you on some other other shit
Just found out about my other other bitch
Went from I love you to you don't know who you fucking with
Fresh off a vaca' and already need another trip
She said I had enough tries
Oh, and I'm the reason that she doesn't trust guys
What's the perfect girl if it's not the perfect time
If you wanna leave fine

[Hook]
Just don't tell me you love me
You're gonna make it too hard for me
I wish you were ugly
It wouldn't be so hard to leave
Cause baby I hate to love you
I can't make up my mind
Cause right when I tell you it's over
By the end of the night I be right back in bed with you
I be right back in bed with you
So don't tell me you love me

[Verse 2]
Wishing I would've tried more, she wanted the truth
Truthfully I wish I lied more cause when I was true
All I heard was ""bye"" more, ""fuck you""
""Who is that"" and ""I don't know why"" more (Shut da fuck up)
We were picture perfect and I tore it all apart
But if I pick up all the pieces we could still be a collage
Feeling like we ended too soon
Used to stay home and do it in all the rooms
Back shots, I know what you like
Had you hitting high notes and you ain't even need no autotune
Nights I was Patron'd up
Girls dressed alike looking like they cloned up
Same nights I wouldn't pick my phone up
And you was thinking damn boy grow up
And I could still hear her leaving
Crazy when a heart breaks it never breaks even
I even found another girl that's perfect
And I'm the only reason we're not working
Cause what's the perfect girl if it's not the perfect time
And if you wanna stay fine

[Hook]
Just don't tell me you love me
You're gonna make it too hard for me
I wish you were ugly
It wouldn't be so hard to leave
Cause baby I hate to love you
I can't make up my mind
Cause right when I tell you it's over
By the end of the night I be right back in bed with you
I be right back in bed with you

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one

[Verse]
You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (Can't take back the love that I gave you)

You made my heart break again (I was tangled up in your drastic ways)

He said, she said
Don't let it get in ya head
Baby don't say
Something that you will regret
I'm on your team
It's us against them you'll see
Hey, we ain't gon stop
They just want what we got

The more they seem so envious
How can they talk about our love
When they don't know one thing about us
Instead they just runnin they mouths
So all we do is tune them out

I swear they got some nerve
Spreadin what they heard
I can't give them no burn
I can't be concerned with all that talk
I won't be involved
That's my word
See I'm not the one
They got me confused
They got me messed up
Don't you think I've had enough
When it comes to what we do
All that matters is us two
Don't pay them no mind
We just gon show and prove

When we met you was a V like Madonna, man
Now you in the field, runnin' plays like Donovan
McNabb before you get in a cab
I trade in my cash
Just to take you back to last summer, man
You don't remember when you was my sweetest
You don't remember I called you Reese's Pieces
Cause it's no wrong way to do you know what
She turned around, giggled, said ""You so nuts!""
But nowadays we actin' way too grown up
Like how ya ex girl get that new number
The rumors was so numerous
For sticking' by me, I had to give you two thumbs up
And that's why

Girl I see you in them Apple Bottom jeans
Chinchilla on your back, I wanna know your name
Girl I'm Twista, I could blow your brains
Put you in a chameleon '04 Range
Still sexy when you smoke that flame
Jerk it like a chicken when you throw that thang
She got me hotter than a oven the way that she talk
Switching to freaky so I'm loving the way that she walk
You looking good, girl, you oughta be in pictures
Listen to me, I see your career going sky high
Taking you home to the crib in the Chi
And everytime I see your thighs I cry when I drive by
Watching you should be a thrill, got the fellas on some Johnny Gill
Steady screaming ""my, my, my, my""
Walk on the carpet with the diamonds that flick in the dark
Kicking it on the couch at 106 & Park
I can see your beauty on the big screen
I can see me freaking you with whipped cream
I can see you on stage at the awards
With a dress better than Jennifer's and doing big things
Kick it with me I can mold your life

The people to know or show you things to get into
I wanna be your lover and your confidant
And protect you from others, don't ever let a brother pimp you
If you want the style, you can get ya girl
Y'all take a look at her, she got such an astonishing body
I can see ya in some Gucci or Robert Cavalli
And I bet she gon' put a hurt on 'em hard in the party
And you know you kill 'em in the club we go
You was born to be a pro, how you know who's taking photos
And I love you cause you freaky with the door closed
Drop it to the flo', let that go when you roll slow
And I love it when I hit it from the back
And you get on top of me and have a brother going ""oh-oh""

Baby girl ass jiggle like she want more
Like she a groupie and I ain't even on tour
Maybe 'cause she heard that I rhyme hardcore
Or maybe 'cause she heard that I buy out the stores
Bottom of the ninth and a nigga gotta score
If not I gotta move on to the next whore

Say she got a kid but she got her tubes tied
Girl, you twenty-one? Girl, that's alright
I'm wonderin' if a shake comin' with them fries
If so, baby, can I get 'em super-sized?
Here comes the four to the three to the two
She started feelin' on my Johnson right out the blue
Girl, you super thick so I'm thinkin' that's cool
But instead of one life hat, I need two

Expression on her face like she ain't got a clue
Then she told me she don't run with the crew
You know how I do but that's just what I gotta do

Self explanatory, I ain't gotta say I'm rich
Yes, single man, I ain't tryin' to get hitched
Liquor wasted on me, man, son of a bitch
Brushed it-it off, now I'm back to gettin' lit
With some orange juice, man, this some good ish

Now he on the sideline starin' at my clique

218,Dude,"[Chorus]
And y'ain't even want it wit da boy
Cuz the way I'm livin life, is a muthafuckin joy
On some grown man B.I
I could have been a girl
Or any ethnicity up in the world
But I'm rollin with the top back
I ain't gotta worry where the cops at
I ain't gotta wear a fucking bra strap
Me and the crew
Are really doing everything that we like to
Man it's a damn good day to be a white dude

[Verse 1]
Shit, i'm living good up in this bitch
Dicky rollin round the city, blowin good up in that wip
I ain't black or Dominican, not Hispanic or Indian
So imprisonment is not a predicament, I envision
For a white boy
Holl atcha muthafuckin kike, boy
Higher than a muthafuckin kite, it's aight boy
They ain't suspicious of Jews
I'll show contrition it's cool
Slap on the wrist, get ma daddy to choose
One of them top lawyers dat be rollin round in his crew
I'm eating chop soy and bowlin on a carnival cruise
Das what I do kid
Happy that my name ain't stupid
Dave coulda been Daquan wit a few kids
But now I'm farting, overeating at meals
If ain't I gotta theme party, Ion't be at goodwill
I'm dentist paying, tennis playing, smellin on some cabernet
And I ain't gay but if I was, everything would be okay, look...
I know I'm being condescending in ma rhymes
But ma premium channels mean Tyler Perry's never live
Getting tickets, they sick, I sit at the eagle 45
Where I'm eating when I'm high's where they eat at to survive (food chains)

[Chorus]
And y'ain't even want it wit da boy

Man it's a damn good day to be a white dude

[Verse 2]
Yeah. It's little DI in this bitch ho
Happy that I'm white, but relieved I ain't a chick yo
I never wake up and have to cake on ma make up
Or straighten hair, I ain't given a damn
I'm wearing whatever I wanna in this muthafucka
They up in heels
And tummy tuckin, they don't grub except for takin' them pills, foreal...
And ion't bleach shit
Ion't gotta eat dick
I ain't bleeding up out ma penis
Smoking the weed, ion't fall asleep because I'm cheefing
In disagreements, I participate without weeping
And when I'm freaking, I'm getting daps, high fives, and all that
Ma rep goin up, and at best, ho a slut
So what up
Ya boy cut up
But eat butter
And I ain't gotta speak to ma mother...to still love her
And I been getting better looking with age
But a guy can get who he deserves wit a horrible face
[Seal interlude]
I go on dates, and never have to worry bout getting raped
And I watch a game and never have to worry bout how it's played
And I meet a babe and never have to act deliriously fake
And if impregnate I can pack a bag and be on my way, but good luck girl!

Man it's a damn good day to be a white dude

[Outro]
Yeah... I'm happy as fuck man
First off I'm a dude so
There was a one in two chance of that sucking
But now I can run a seven minute mile
I can defend my self adequately
I can be logical
I can get along with my room-mates
Watch serious movies without being scared by them
And the on top of that I'm white
Which is like, amazing because
Everybody naturally assumes I'm a great person
I get a fair shot at the life I deserve
I mean I could underachieve my way into any college in the country
I get my hair cut at a salon
People hold the door open for me which is nice
Er, I never have to get into a fight, like, for social purposes
And please don't take this as me just disparaging black people
It ain't about that
It's about me being happy that I'm white, know what I'm saying?
But on that note, could someone explain to me why Fat Joe, and any other person of Hispanic descent, is allowed to say the N-word
I mean I guess it's unrelated but like that shit don't make any sense
I've been thinking about that shit a lot

Oh, what could go so wrong
With a girl and a zombie
You're from the perfect paradise
And I'm living on the darker side

Girl, you look delicious
Oh, I mean gorgeous
Well, now you're getting fearless
No, I'm just rooting for us
If different was a super power
We'd be so flawless
Yeah, we could make these two worlds ours
I'm rooting for us
Two lonely hearts meet in the dark
Imagine it now they start a spark
You got my attention
What happens next, then?
Movies and long walks in the park
Hanging out anywhere we want
I like the way you're thinking
I can almost see it

My dearest son, it's almost June
I hope this letter catches up with you and finds you well
It's been dry but they're callin' for rain
And everything's the same ol' in Johnsonville
Your stubborn ol' daddy ain't said too much
But I'm sure you know he sends his love
And she goes on, In a letter from home

[Chorus]
I hold it up and show my buddies
Like we ain't scared
And our boots ain't muddy
And they all laugh like there's something funny
'Bout the way I talk, when mama sends her best y'all
I fold it up and put it in my shirt
Pick up my gun and get back to work
And it keeps me drivin' on, waitin' on
Letters from home

[Verse 2]
My dearest love, it's almost dawn
I've been layin' here all night long
Wonderin' where you might be
I saw your mama and I showed her the ring
Man on the television said something
So I couldn't sleep
But I'll be alright, I'm just missin' you
And this is me kissin' you
X's and O's in a letter from home

[Chorus 2]
I hold it up and show my buddies
Like we ain't scared and our boots ain't muddy
And they all laugh cause she calls me honey
But they take it hard, 'cause I don't read the good parts
I fold it up and put it in my shirt
Pick up my gun and get back to work
And it keeps me drivin' on, waitin' on
Letters from home

[Verse 3]
Dear son, I know I ain't written
And sittin' here tonight alone in the kitchen
It occurs to me I might not have said it, so I'll say it now
Son, you make me proud

[Chorus 3]
I hold it up and show my buddies
Like we ain't scared and our boots ain't muddy
But no one laughs
'Cause ain't nothin' funny when a soldier cries
And I just wipe my eyes

And it keeps me drivin' on, waitin' on

I miss you, I miss you

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Hello there
The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
Where are you?
And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on so haunting every time
And as I stare I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge and Mark Hoppus]
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)

Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)

All you Trekkies and TV addicts
Don't mean to diss, don't mean to bring static
All you Klingons in the fucking house
Grab your backstreet friend and get loud
Blowin' doors off hinges
I'll grab you with the pinchers
And no, I didn't retire
I'll snatch you up with a needle nose pliers

[Verse 2: Mike D]
Like Mutual of Omaha
Got the ill boat you've never seen before
Glidin' in the glades
And like Lorne Greene, you know I get paid
Like caprese and with the basil
Not goofy like Darren or Hazel
I'm a motherfuckin' Nick at Night
With classics rerunning that you know all right

[Verse 3: Ad Rock]
Now remain calm, no alarm
'Cause my farm ain't fat
So what's up with that?
I've got friends and family that I respect
When I think I'm too good, they put me in check
So believe when I say I'm no better than you
Except when I rap, so I guess it ain't true
Like that, y'all, and you just don't stop
Guaranteed to make your body rock

Method of controlling my mind

Now, hey, baby bubba, now what's the deal?

I add up, the mathematician
I'm a bank cashier, engineer
I wear cotton and I don't wear sheer

In the whip, I'm gonna cruise past ya
Yo, money, don't chump yourself

Don't test me, they can't arrest me
I'll fake right, cross-over and shoot lefty

You look like Cable Guy dunked off of your crown
I flow like smoke out a chimney

Get your clothes right out the dryer
Put Armor All up on your tire

It's hard growin' up lookin' at drug dealers wit' all this paper
Wonderin' how I can get me some
My family's strugglin', I'm buggin', sittin' on my porch
So confused, chewin' on some bubblegum
I was always taught to use my manners with the misses
But please, stay away from the hoes and snitches
And I was always reached for the sky, I dont know why
Ima little bitty kid wit' a whole buncha gangsta wishes
When I grow up, you just wait, Ima be so straight
And everything's gonna be so marvelous
No more borrowin' from the neighbors, no more haters
No more blowin' Nintendo cartridges
Ima have it made in the shade, Ima be so paid
And my fam, get 'em off that payin' them bills
Matta fact Im schemin' my way on up out this hood, I'll be good
When I ditch these trainin' wheels

[Verse 2]
I'm sick and tired of ridin' public transportation
Been patient waitin' on my set of wheels
I'm willin' to do what it takes, whatever the stakes
In order to get myself some dollar bills
It's too many holes in my socks, and I'm ready to box
Anyone tellin' me I need better shoes
And I ain't the only one trippin', or makin a fuss
My older cousin need some cheddar too
He thinkin' 'bout comin' up on the lick, to get it quick
It involves that local corner store
I overheard him say he knew who works there
And whatever they do, dont let the owner know
I hope he come back with enough to let me borrow some change
At least for the summer
And if he dont let me borrow nothin, but ask me what I want
Ima tell him I wanna...

[Verse 3]
Why can't I walk with a limp mama? won't be no drama
For goodness sakes, Im just a kid
Had to get my whoopin' in fo's, I was just a po'
Like there no remorse for what I did
Gotta learn the hard way, when runnin' them streets
How some just creep, really just to eat a meal
""I coulda swore it was mine,"" what I used to tell the po-pos
What I left to rob and steal
Man, I gotta earn for a livin', ain't nobody givin' me nothin'
Find somethin' I love to do
Hmm, what about that pimpin'? It's good tippin'
Tax free, and I know a lot of people that love to screw
Yeah, it's just a way of the world, with boys and girls
I'm adjustin' to my environment
This government cheatin' us, so I'll cheat 'em back
Why can't work feel like retirement?

She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, ""Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair.""
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, 'cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe

Rollie's and Pasha's done drove me crazy

Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, ""Nigga, you ain't up on this.""
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe

Come on, come on

I say, ""Fuck the police,"" that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', ""Where the ballers at?""
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
‘Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it

And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?

Oh, when it all, it all falls down

We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down

We gon' set this party off right

We gon' show 'em how we get down

But around my way that's how you get fucked up
(But you don't hear me)
You might think we all beats and rhymes
But way before this rap shit, nigga, the streets was mine
(But you don't hear me)
I got that hot shit, that ""Thug Life"" 'Pac shit
That get hot shit, that B.I.G. ""Ready to Die"" shit

226,Don't Take Your Love Away,"[Verse 1]
After the hoping and the praying and the wishing
Girl your right here in my face
I never been the one to bite my tongue, no, no...
I have not one word to say
I'm mesmerized by your sexy eyes and
Your soft and lovely skin
I want this fiasco to end
So baby we can start all over again

(Listen)
(I wanna be able...) I wanna be able to love you, oh I...
(I wanna be able...) And let me be the one to please you, oh I...
As sure as the sun shines all over the earth
You're one of god's most precious works
See, I'm a man and we make mistakes
But please don't take your love away, oh I...

(Chorus)
Don't take your love away. (Don't take...)
Baby, don't take your love away from me, I need you, girl. (I need you girl.)
Don't take your love away. (Oh.)
Don't take your love away
Don't take your love away (Don't take...)
Baby don't take your love away from me I need you girl (From me, my baby, baby)
Don't take your love away, baby

(Verse II)
Mama said, 'Don't put your hands in the cookie jar.'
She said, 'Son, have control.'
She said everything that's sweet and good for you, NO. (That what she said.)
And everything that glitters ain't gold
And now that your gone, I realized, (Yes, I do.) I've lost my soul. (Preach.)
And I don't want to pass the torch
Baby can you give me one more, one more, chance?

(I wanna be able) Able to do everything I didn't do before for ya, baby
(I wanna be able) Listen. I wanna love ya, over, over and over again
Gotta hold myself together and stay strong
Baby, you been gone too long
See, I'm a man and we make mistakes
So baby, baby, baby, don't take your love away

(Chorus)
Don't take your love away (I'll get down on my hands and knees,)
Baby, don't take your love away from me, I need you, girl. (Beggin', beggin' you please.)
Don't take your love away, (Don't, don't leave me now.)
Don't take your love away. (I need you right here with me.)
Don't take your love away, (Please, please, please, please, please, yeah.)
Baby, don't take your love away from me, I need you, girl. (Don't take your love away.)

(Bridge)
See, girl I know that I hurt you so, (Girl, I know...)
With all of those girls that were in my world. (In my world.)
Now Stacy and Kim, damn all of them
Girl, I wanna give you everything I can. (Every day, yeah.)
I know your tired of my game, (Of my games...) tired of my lies, (Of my lies...)
Baby, this time I promise it'll be alright
No longer will you be left astray, (No, no, no, no, no.)
Baby, listen to the words I say!

(Chorus)
Don't take your love away (Yeah, yeah!)
Baby, don't take your love away from me, I need you girl. (Yes, Don't take your love, no.)
Don't take your love away, (I've been searching here and there, everywhere,)
Don't take your love away. (And can't find no one like you, girl.)
Don't take your love away, (Don't take your love away.)
Baby, don't take your love away from me, I need you, girl. (Listen to me, lady, lady, lady.)
Don't take your love...

227,99 Problems,"[Produced by Rick Rubin]

[Chorus]
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one

[Verse 1]
I've got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's Money, Cash, Hoes
I'm from the hood, stupid! What type of facts are those?
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was havin' dough
I'm like, ""Fuck critics, you can kiss my whole asshole!
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward.""
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
They don't play my hits, well, I don't give a shit, so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads
Fuckers, I don't know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay Z has
I'm from rags to riches, niggas, I ain't dumb
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

[Verse 2]
The year is '94, in my trunk is raw
In my rearview mirror is the motherfuckin' law
Got two choices, y'all: pull over the car or
Bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor
And I ain't tryin' to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case
So I pull over to the side of the road
I heard, ""Son, do you know why I'm stopping you for?""
‘Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low?
Do I look like a mind reader, sir? I don't know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some more?
""Well, you was doing 55 in a 54
License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carrying a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are.""
I ain't steppin' out of shit, all my paper's legit
""Well, do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?""
Well, my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that
""Aren't you sharp as a tack?
You some type of lawyer or something?
Somebody important or something?""
Well, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit
""Well, we'll see how smart you are when the K9 come!""
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one

[Verse 3]
Now once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong-arm a ho
This is not a ho in the sense of havin' a pussy
But a pussy havin' no goddamn sense, try and push me
I try to ignore him, talk to the Lord
Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform
You know the type, loud as a motorbike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing that's gon' happen is I'ma get to clappin'
And he and his boys gonna be yappin' to the Captain
And there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again
Back through the system with the riff-raff again
Fiends on the floor, scratchin' again
Paparazzis with they cameras, snappin' em
D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mil' for bail ‘cause I'm African
All because this fool was harassin' them
Tryin' to play the boy like he's saccharine
But ain't nothin' sweet 'bout how I hold my gun
I got 99 problems, bein' a bitch ain't one – hit me!

[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

228,Get No Better,"[Verse 1: Noveliss]
Chickity check, it brought the soul back to the home team
Motown, why can't you see my team is supreme, Diana
Welcome to the solar system of the Forces
You running in a circle we just chewing on your orbit

[Verse 2: Ilajide]
Forfeit fork it over, a Heimlich maneuver
Me and my niggas will make the cut like you Ryu Hayabusa
Future brighter, do whatever you could imagine
Imagine the forces with you, running the web like arachnids
Tarantulas eight-legged gargantuous animals
Causing maximum damage with my tongue and an animal

[Verse 3: E-Fav]
While we be focused on a salary, lettuce to bring the croutons
I'm trying to have a dollar bill salad right on Obama's lawn
Let you be the pawn with my niggas playing hooky
While my paper double triple like Lebron as a rookie

[Verse 4: Laz]
I'm feeling better than, better than, better than the veterans
I use the booth as my pulpit, I'm a reverend (Chuuch!)
On the road where you could find us
Not gassed up, the shit is 4 bucks, so we avoid pumps
We serving rappers like they ordered it
Till we post on blogs, post up and loitering

[Verse 5: Noveliss]
The story ends where ours begins, now flip the page
In the park shooting jumpers while others was flipping yay
No Cartiers, couple of J's and reading comics
Could have labeled me a nerd, but slaying bitches in the closet
Awesome, left the city early they forget him, nah
I come from 2 worlds but the city know I got 'em
Went from smelling crack smoke at that busted house at our neighbors
To rarely seeing black folk, the only nigga turning in papers

[Verse 6: E-Fav]
Cause it's a, a new era, no American apparel
No lucifer in my levels, eradicating these devils
From out of my air space, take a hit (See space)
Take a listen, did I mention we the new freebase? (Get laced)
Spin around, (Listen nigga) look straight
This is lyrical hypnosis, toting this 45
It's sagging cause of the holster, world's weight up on my shoulders
Nuts about as big as boulders

[Verse 7: Ilajide]
They dropping like roller coasters
You bagging up at they Kroger, trying to meet a fucking quota
Give it up, my nigga, it's over
Get it knocking like Jehovah
Who colder my shit is cryogenic, I'm authentic clinic
Who with me?
Come get it with me and make sure all these niggas is finished

[Verse 8: Laz]
Yes sir, lets get into it, it's only right I get it in

Taught to reach for the stars when we was little kids
Now, it's smoke clouds, 'cause the sky is what the limit is

It don't get no better, no better
It don't get no better, no better
It don't get no better, no better
Than this

[Verse 9: E-Fav]
Heavy mentally, the mic I am dismembering
I spit it for my niggas, we kill it with verbal symmetry
You'll just be a memory, with the pen I'm a blessing
Trying to steal my secret cookbook, call that shit Inception
My conception was immaculate so this is wrapped in Reynolds
Know you mad cause they listen and you can't afford a rental
Face is sour as a

[Verse 10: Laz]
And bread the only thing that's on the menu
The blind lead the blind, open up your windows
Take a breath of fresh air that we can give you
In this game we just some niggas trying to blow, we on Nintendo

[Verse 11: Ilajide]
Parental advisory, advising me is simple
Just get me a 100 miles away from an instrumental
My influential flows get a mama out her pantyhose
Grandiose spit it 'til cameo is a cameo
I hope you fight well, ain't going nowhere
I'm Shawn Michaels, turn it up and sweet chin music your head

Go head, we got this rap shit down to a mad science
The biochemist, everything I write hard, hieroglyphics
Welcome to the round table where we plot on all our challengers
King Arthur of the art which is written with Excalibur
Jet lag mixed with hiatus
Gamma Fly Beta, was born with an ultimatum:
Write and become the greatest or become a statistic
Listed with averages and tables, proving the illustration
The picture they paint us we animals, lock us in cages
No zoos just a concrete jungle, we fucking made it
For my team I'll be a martyr

Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get that dirt off your shoulder

[Verse 1]
I probably owe it to y'all, probably be locked by the force
Tryin' to hustle some things that go with the Porsche
Feelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law, nigga, grippin' my balls
Said the ladies, they love me, from the bleachers they screamin'
All the ballers is bouncin', they like the way I be leanin'
All the rappers be hatin' off the track that I'm makin'
But all the hustlers, they love it, just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom of the bottom, to the top of the pops
Nigga, London, Japan and I'm straight off the block
Like a running back, get it? Man, I'm straight off the block
I can run it back, nigga, ‘cause I'm straight with the Roc

[Chorus]
If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off

Your homie Hov' in position, in the kitchen with soda
I just whipped up a watch, tryin' to get me a Rover
Tryin' to stretch out the coca, like a wrestler, yessir
Keep the Heckler close, you know them smokers'll test ya
But, like, 52 cards went out, I'm through dealin'
Now 52 bars come out, now you feel 'em
Now 52 cars roll out, remove ceilin'
In case 52 broads come out, now you chillin'
With a boss, bitch, of course, S.C. on the sleeve
At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen
I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean
No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real

[Chorus]
If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you

[Verse 3]
Your boy back in the building; Brooklyn, we back on the map
Me and my beautiful bee-itch in the back of that 'Bach
I'm the realest to run it, I just happen to rap
I ain't gotta clap at 'em, niggas scared of that black
I drop that Black Album, then I back out it
As the best rapper alive, nigga, ask 'bout me
From bricks to Billboards, from grams to Grammy's
From O's to opposite of Orphan Annie
You gotta pardon Jay, for sellin' out the Garden in a day
I'm like a young Marvin in his hey'
I'm a hustler, homie, you a customer crony
Got some dirt on my shoulder; could you brush it off for me?

If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off

In time you slipped away

Watching every motion in this foolish lover's game
Haunted by the notion, somewhere there's a love in flames

232,Paint Me A Birmingham,"[Verse 1]
He was sittin' there, his brush in hand
Painting waves as they danced, upon the sand
With every stroke, he brought to life
The deep blue of the ocean, against the mornin' sky
I asked him if he only painted ocean scenes
He said for twenty dollars, I'll paint you anything

[Chorus]
Could you paint me at Birmingham
Make it look just the way I planned
A little house on the edge of town
Porch goin' all the way around
Put her there in the front yard swing
Cotton dress make it, early spring
For a while she'll be mine again
If you could paint me a Birmingham

[Verse 2]
He looked at me, with knowing eyes
Then took a canvas from a bag there by his side
Picked up a brush, and said to me
Son, just where in this picture would you like to be
I said if there's any way you can
Could you paint me back into her arms again

[Chorus]
Could you paint me at Birmingham
Make it look just the way I planned
A little house on the edge of town
Porch goin' all the way around
Put her there in the front yard swing
Cotton dress make it, early spring
For a while she'll be mine again
If you could paint me a Birmingham

I don't know, dude
I think everybody's all jealous and shit
‘Cause I'm like the lead singer of the band, dude
And I think everybody's got a fucking problem with me, dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show, because…

[Chorus: Eminem]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
‘Cause once I blow, they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

[Verse 1: Eminem]
So I get off stage, right, drop the mic
Walk up to these hot chicks and I'm all like
""Sup? Ladies, my name's Slim Shady
I'm the lead singer in D12, baby""
They're all like, ""Oh my God, it's him
Becky, oh my fucking God, it's Eminem
I swear to fucking God, dude, you fucking rock
Please Marshall, please, let me suck your cock""
And by now, the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas
All the chicks start yelling, all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry
‘Cause they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude! I just think you're trying to steal the light from me
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
‘Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife-to-be
This rock star shit, it's the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me, because these…

[Chorus: Eminem]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
‘Cause once I blow, they know that I'll be the man

Okay dawg, gi—come on
Dude!
Give me this mic!
Ow, dude!

[Verse 2: Swifty McVay (& Kon Artis)]
You just wanna see a nigga backwards, don't you?
ADAT? How come we don't rap on Pro Tools?
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van and he in a tour bus
You don't want my autograph, you's a liar
And no, I'm Swift (Oh, I thought you were Kuniva)
What the hell is wrong with our dressing room?!
‘Cause our shit is looking smaller than a decimal
See, I know how to rap, it's simple, but
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book
So I'm more intact, tryin' to get on the map
Doing jumping jacks while getting whipped on my back

[Verse 3: Kuniva, Kon Artis, & (Eminem)]
Look at Em's little punk ass thinking he the shit
Yeah, I know, man, by himself taking all the flicks
Hey, I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue
(No, I had an interview, not you two)
You gon' be late for soundcheck, man, I ain't going to soundcheck
And our mics are screwed up and his always sound best!
You know what, man? I'ma say something
Ayo Em! (You got somethin' to say?!) Man, nothin'!
I thought you was about to tell him off, man, wassup?
Man, I'ma tell him when I feel like it, man, shut up!
You ain't even back me up when we supposed to be crew
Man, I was 'bout to talk right after you, I swear
Aww, man, whatever I swear, man!

[Chorus: Eminem]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
‘Cause once I blow, they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

[Verse 4: Proof & (Eminem)]
They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Went from sold out arenas to amusement parks
I'm gon' let the world know that Proof is hot
I should cut his mic off when the music starts
(Ayo, it's…) Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear (Hey, dude, I love your band!)
We ain't a band, bitch, we don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get 10 percent?
And these guys acting funny every area code
(Proof, carry my bag!) Bitch, carry your own!
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?!

[Verse 5: Bizarre]
God damn it, I'm sick of this group
Time for me to go solo and make some loot
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps

I've been trying my best to get along
But that's OK
There's nothing left to say, but

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me

I went out driving trying to clear my head
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been
So

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and take your reasons

And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather

But you'll think of me

Don't worry, I'll be fine
I'm going to be alright

Wishing I could hold you tight
I'll be over you
And on with my life

[Chorus]
So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me
Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and all your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Because we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me, oh

248,Time's Up!,"[Produced by Buckwild]

[Intro]
Ayo, Storm, time's up
Time's up

[Verse 1]
You lack the minerals and vitamins, irons and the niacin
Fuck who did I offend, rappers, sit back, I’m ‘bout to begin
Bout foul talk you squawk, never even walked the walk
More less destined to get tested, never been arrested
My album will manifest many things that I saw, did, or heard about
All told firsthand, never word of mouth
What’s in the future for the fusion in the changer?
Rappers are in danger, who will use wits to be a remainder?
When the missile is aimed to blow you out of the frame
Some will keep their limbs and some will be maimed
The same suckers with the gab about killer instincts
Will turn bitch and knowing damn well they lack in this division
The connoisseur cracking your head with a four-by-four
Realize, sucker, I’ll be the coming like Noah
Always simmer you down, perpetrating façade and what you consider an image
To me, this is just a scrimmage
I’m feel I’m stone, not ‘cause I bop or wear my cap cocked
The more emotion I put into it, the harder I rock
Those who pose lyrical but really ain’t true, I feel
(Their time’s limited, hardrocks’ too)

[Scratching]
“Their time’s limited, hardrocks’ too”

[Verse 2]
Speaking in tongues about what you did but you never done it
Admit it, you bit it ‘cause the next man gained platinum and behind it
I find it ironic, so I researched and analyzed
Most write about stuff they fantasized
I’m fed up with the bull on this focus of weed and clips
And Glock's getting cocked, and wax not being flipped
It’s the same old, same old, just straining from the anal
The content is not complexed or vexed
So why you pushing it? Why you lying for? I know where you live
I know your folks, you was a sucker as a kid
Your persona’s drama that you acquired in high school in acting class
Your whole aura is Plexiglass
What’s-her-face told me you shot this kid last week in the park
That’s a lie, you was in church with your moms
See, I know, yo, slow your roll, give a “good to go”
Guys be lacking in this thing called “rapping just for dough”
Of course, we got to pay rent, so money connects, but uh
I’d rather be broke and have a whole lot of respect
It’s the principle of it, I get a rush when I bust some dope lines I wrote
That maybe somebody’ll quote
That’s what I consider real in this field of music
Instead of putting brain cells to work, they abuse it
Non-conceptual, non-exceptional
Everybody’s either crime-related or sexual
I’m here to make a difference, besides all the riffing
To traps I’m not sticking, rappers, stop flipping
For those who pose lyrical but really ain’t true, I feel
(Their time’s limited, hardrocks’ too)

250,Desperately,"[Verse 1]
You were cruel, you're unkind
I was fine without your love
And I can't undo
I can't unwind
Now I want it desperately
Now I want it desperately
I'm turning blue by your side
Making light visible love
And I'll never find a way to say goodbye
Cause I want it desperately
Cause I want it desperately

[Chorus]
Baby, I can never get too far away
Away, hey

[Verse 2]
You speak truth with your eyes
While the lies come from below
And I thought you say you're grown but it's alright
And now I want it desperately
And now I want it desperately
And it can't get better baby if you try
Onset fever in the night
Miss a midnight crawl
The bedside sprawl
Oh I want it desperately
Oh I want it desperately

Baby, you can never get too far away, away
Baby, I can never get too far away, away, hey

251,This Way,"[Verse 1: Khalid]
You say I'm trippin'; bullshit
You're the one to make me do shit
You're the one to make me feel it
The feeling of stupid
I was in your corner
When you were putting me through shit
Now you wanna leave
No, you leaving me was foolish

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
You left me this scar on my heart
And I left you a brand new car
How nice of you, the price of true love
True love is absolute

[Chorus: Khalid]
So what more can I say?
You make me this way
What more can I say?
You make me this way

[Verse 2: H.E.R.]
Yeah, all of these excuses
Say I'm the one that made you ruthless
Well you're the reason I'm crazy
And with you, I feel useless
I let you have it
You took me for granted
Always wanna play the victim
When they don't know the truth is...

[Pre-Chorus: H.E.R. with Khalid]
You left me this scar on my heart
When I'd never take it that far (oh)
Why would you say that it was true love
If true love is absolute, what more can I say?

[Chorus: Khalid & H.E.R., H.E.R.]
What more can I say?
You make me this way
(You make me this way)
What more can I say?
(What can I say?)
You make me this way

[Bridge: H.E.R.]
I tried to stay the night
You won't let me inside
Oh, you push me away
You'll never change
Just another fight
Between you and your pride
Oh, what more can I say?
What more can I?

[Chorus: Khalid & H.E.R., H.E.R.]
What more can I say? (Say)
You make me this way
You make me this way
What more can I say?

Boom, boom, boom
Ha-ha!

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Ready for action, nip it in the bud
We never relaxing, OutKast is everlasting
Not clashing, not at all
But see, my nigga went to do a little acting
Now, that's for anyone asking, give me one pass 'em
Drip-drip-drop, there goes an eargasm
Now you cumming out the side of your face
We tapping right into your memory banks—thanks!
So click it or ticket, let's see your seat belt fastened
Trunk rattling, like two midgets in the backseat 'rassling
Speakerboxxx vibrate the tag
Make it sound like aluminum cans in the bag
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S bass?
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S bass?

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
The whole room fell silent, the girls all paused with glee
Turning left, turning right, are they looking at me?
Well I was looking at them, there there on the dancefloor
Now they got me in the middle, feeling like a manwhore
Especially the big girl
Big girls need love too, no discrimination here, squirrel
So keep your hands off my cheeks
Let me study how you ride the beat, you big freak
Skinny-slim women got the cameltoe within them
You can hump them, lift them, bend them
Give them something to remember
Yell out ""Timber!"" when you fall through the chop shop
Take a deep breath and exhale
Your ex-male friend/boyfriend's boring as hell
But let me listen to the story you tell
And we can make moves like a person in jail
On the low, ho

Misty sunrise in my hometown
Rows of cotton about knee high
Mrs. Baker down the dirt road
Still got clothes out on the line

Erwin Nichols there
With Judsley playin checkers at the gin
When I dream about the Southland
This is where it all begins

From Carolina down to Georgia
Smell the jasmine and magnolia
Sleepy sweet home Alabama
Roll Tide Roll

Muddy water Mississippi
Blessed Graceland whispers to me
Carry on, carry on
Sweet Southern comfort, carry on

Catching catfish on the river
Chasing fireflies by the creek
Kissing Gabby Williams' sister
On the porch homecoming week

With rusted cars and weeping willows
Keeping watch out in the yard
Just a snapshot of downhome Dixie
Could be anywhere you are

[Chorus:]
In Carolina or in Georgia
Open arms are waiting for you
Louisiana
Yellow Rose of San Antone

Arkansas
Mississippi
Old man river whispers to me
Carry on, carry on
Sweet Southern comfort, carry on

As I sit here
I'm surrounded by these priceless memories
I don't have to think about it
There's no place I'd rather be
Than

Who'll be the last one standing? When the cold ice melts away
Who'll be the last one standing? When the smoke drowns out the day
Who'll be the last one standing? When it all goes up in flames
I'll be the last one standing!

[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
Coming out from the middle of the map with a limited attack
And I fight it till the end before we get it to the idiots, illiterate attack
Diss that, belligerent we're never that!
Fuck peace, gimme a gun and get it back
When the television crack I'm developing a pack with this medicine for many not a penny will be levied
I'll be ready for the evil clan, nah, fuck that!
Stand up and get yourself a better back
Spinal chords struck with a bat
Ever seen a grown man fast to react?
Well I do when I'm feelin up and runnin' up their stats
Take a weight of every life we live
And get snubbed by the ones who want to fight for this
I'm decisive hits without a license, bitch
And move now if you know you need to vibe with this

[Verse 2: Bernz]
Soldier till the death of me, till my last breath come from my lifeless lungs
Some kill for the recipe
If it all burned down which one of us gon' run?
Which one from the place of glory? Short ending with a long story
Maybe we want too much and program but the city do not give a fuck, a blood oath!
One for the saints, one for my bros, two for my brains
One for the ghost that are haunting my friend while I been out here workin' to get us some chains
Now I realize that we're slow and I wait
But I be dead cause it's probably too late
Was betrayed by my friend and I feel like I'm play mercenary, too scary to tame to love with the fame
Now we coast

Where my crew, where my kin, where are all my believers at? Where are all of my samurai, mastering their craft? I don't know, man I don't know where all them go. I don't know, I don't know..

[Verse 3: Wrekonize]
Kick it up into the center of the madness, they say it to me that it's kill or be killed
Never diss up in the penny of a savage, it's like I want to come a shoot em at the wheel
Kill to still feel the chill
The cold days let me know that I am definitely alive
And I walked in the valley with the vibe but by carrying the time
But they hassle me to drive
Can I dive, high, glide, by, try, get up!
See the enemies are eyes, wide, tried, high, jealous fucks!
This forever been the state of war
Morse code, all alone in the safer door
Take the tour, be late for the ancient whore
I'm a fighter till the end, that's what the bass is for!

[Verse 4: Bernz]
Maaan, I swear I saw it coming, no crystal ball was needed
Too much, too soon and now my trench is missing, soldiers bleeding
Missin' some other hethens, but I ain't got no grievance
Everybody's fightin wars against they own personal demons
Hurricane's got a little bit of aim, pop pop at the window pane
Doc Brown of Delorian fame, couldn't do shit when he cropped that fame
And I smile like it's okay, but fuck the world is what I say
Under my breath when they turn away cause this game is rigged to keep us enslaved!

Who'll be the last one standing? When it all goes up in flames
Who'll be the last one standing? When the cold ice melts away
Who'll be the last one standing? When the smoke drowns out the day
Who'll be the last one standing? When it all goes up in flames
I'll be the last one standing!

[Verse 5: Tech N9ne]
In the middle of a crisis
N9ne has got a knife and I get really hype and fight the type to spite the
Light then ignite the righteous
Let's get the bright devices, and wipe the likeness!
Kill em and will em I get the pilly and then the devil
I was a happy go-lucky then I'm at another level
Cause everybody wanna be evil people
We believe a demon gotta bleed from eagles!
And that's 'kays, Tech sprays on a vet's day, you gotta death weigh
I got an angel up in my x-ray, but when the debts laid, that is your Net Pay!

Oh, no, no, no

[Verse 1]
Hope life's been good to you
Since you've been gone
I'm doing fine now — I've finally moved on

I'm not surprised just how well I survived
I'm over the worst, and I feel so alive

My dreams only die when I'm dreaming

Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface

Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you

Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you

And to make her feel special, I let her call me by my government name

Adrift at sea with no one left to rescue

Tonic and a fifth of gin

This is one last time
I promise one last time

I miss the taste of a sweeter life
I miss the conversation

We drew a map to a better place

269,Hotel,"[Verse 1: Don Henley]
On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
""This could be Heaven or this could be Hell""
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

[Chorus: Don Henley]
""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here""

[Verse 2: Don Henley]
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes Benz
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
She calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain
""Please bring me my wine""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here since 1969""
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

[Chorus: Don Henley]
""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They living it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis""

[Verse 3: Don Henley]
Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said: ""We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device""
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
""Relax,"" said the night man
""We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave!""

But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

If you're feeling lucky duck then press your luck

Your nine spray, my mind spray
Malignant mist that'll leave comp' defunct
The result's your remains stuffed in a car trunk
You couldn't come to the jungles of the East popping that yang
You won't survive, get live, catching wreck is our thing
I don't gang bang or shoot out bang bang
The relentless lyrics the only dope I slang
I'm a true master you can check my credentials
'Cause I choose to use my infinite potential
Got a freaky, freaky, freaky, freaky flow
Control the mic like Fidel Castro locked Cuba
So deep that you can't scuba dive
My jive's origin is unknown like the Jubas
I've accumulated honeys all across the map
'Cause I'd rather bust a nut than bust a cap
In your back in fact my rap snaps your sacroiliac
I'm the mack so I don't need to tote a MAC
My attack is purely mental and its nature's not hate
It's meant to wake ya up out of your brainwashed state
Stagnate nonsense, for if you persist
You'll get your snotbox bust you press up on this
I flip, hoes dip, none of the real niggas skip
You don't know enough math to count the mics that I've ripped
Peep the Dirty Rotten scamp as his verbal weapons spit

[Verse 2]
Real, rough and rugged, shine like a gold nugget
Every time I pick up the microphone I drug it
Unplug it on chumps with the gangster babble
Leave your nines at home and bring your skills to the battle
You're rattling on and on and ain't saying nothing
That's why you got snuffed when you bumped heads with Dirty Rotten
Have you forgotten I'll tap your jaw?
I also kick like kung fu flicks by Run Run Shaw
Made frauds bleed every time I G'd
'Cause I've perfected my drunken style like Sam Seed
Pseudo psychos, I play like Michael Jackson
When I'm busting ass and breaking backs
Inhale the putrified aroma
Breathe too deep and you'll wind up coma‒
Toast the king I'm hard like a fifth of vodka
And bring your clique 'cause I'm a hard rock knocker
I gotcha out on a limb, about to push you off the plank

Fly like a jet, sting like a hornet

With styles more fatal than second hand smoke
Don't provoke the wrath of this rhyme inventor
'Cause I blow up spots like the World Trade Center
Come with the super trooper on his assault mission
The TEC's technique 'cause he's a technician
Wishing he'll go away won't help the weapons stop
The skills are shot 'cause any idiot can let off a Glock
Hard rocks melt in the clutch of the sun toucher
You claim you got beef on the streets, so what ya
Gonna do when real niggas roll up on you
And you don't got your crew
Pull your Glock, hmm...? But you don't got the heart
You was webbed straight from the start
Bought a tool and didn't learn how to use it

[Verse 1: Skepta]
Listen
Yeah, when I came in the game I kept my eyes wide open like fish in the sea
I'm done smiling with people I don't like in places I don't wanna be
She told me it's just a little bit of powder so I look better in HD
I saw the video, I had so much make-up I didn't even look like me
So now it's just me, myself and the camera, 1080p
She saw the video fullscreen on YouTube, now she wants to fuck with a G
Told me she'd come into my house in a long coat with nothing underneath
I would love you more if you brought me a packet of Rizla and something to eat
Please, keep it simple don't act like a leech
I don't wanna hear your ""I'm not a groupie, tell me your real name"" speech
My real name is Skepta and I do this for my niggas that breach
I do this for the girl with green eyes sunbathing topless on a beach
I tell an A&R come check me if you wanna talk about making an anthem
You wanna talk label politics, go and check David Cameron
Cause if success is judged by chart positions and riches
I'll put the mic down and leave my legacy to reign on all these bitches

I love you so much sometimes I can't breathe
But I still find that standing here watching you leave
I know you want excitement and life on the edge

This is dedicated to the lover (to the lover)
In you, in you, in you
I can't wait, I can't wait
I can't wait, no I can't wait

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
Leather in the summer, silk in the winter
This is such an art, where do I begin-a?
Used to sing tenor, in the church choir
Really I was flexin', but the girls they were fire
I'm the type of guy that notice subtle signs
When I cuddle mine, she ain't even tryin'
To look sexy, but even if she was, so what?
Motherfucker grow up, don't mean to be so abrupt
But that let's me know that she's a human being
And being human's hard—on the boulevard
Girl, you got it bad, glad I'm not one
But yet you got it good, you are the hot one
But I'm André, Benjamin André to be exact
You'd hope to meet a gentleman one day, well this is that
In fact, Dookie introduced us at a show
About a year or so ago, I don't know, mind slips me
I'm in the Southern states, you know, where all the pimps be
Dressin all boogey and carryin' ugly cups
And yes, you're getting booed if your shit do not get down
And yes, you're getting sued by women who didn't get up
Out their seat on the bus, and feet shouldn't rust
And beat is a must, and we shouldn't lust
But we do, I'm laughin' at the calendars and clocks
Ascot to match the socks, what's in your Speakerboxxx?
""Pink and Blue"", you're lollygaggin', you're slow pokin'
You got me open, you're playin' wit me, darlin I'm not a toy
As if Anita Baker brings the joy
Your kind are the Tyner, meanin' the real McCoy

Sir Luscious is the real deal but even he gets antsy
Some honeys try to kill Bill beneath the underpants see
But patience is a virtue to being anxious, just might hurt you

A line of niggas tryin' to get in Vision on a full moon
Should I play it cool or be the one to make the first move?
Anticipatin' and contemplatin', she got you sprung, dude
Shit, I'm finna get her, might even hit her, what you gon' do? (what?)
I tell you what, we won't be fallin' for that one-two

And if she don't, then I'll dial another date
That means find another face to replace cause I can't wait

To be the bad man, to be the sad man

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

[Verse 2]
No one knows what it's like
To feel these feelings like I do
And I blame you

No one bites back as hard
On their anger, none of my pain and woe
Can show through

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

[Bridge]
When my fist clenches, crack it open
Before I use it and lose my cool
When I smile, tell me some bad news
Before I laugh and act like a fool

And if I swallow anything evil
Put your finger down my throat
And if I shiver, please give me a blanket
Keep me warm, let me wear your coat

And floods the floors we thought would always keep us safe and dry
And in the midst of sailing ships we sink our lips into the ones we love
That have to say goodbye

And as I float along this ocean
I can feel you like a notion that won't seem to let me go
And when I look to the sky something tells me you're here with me
And you make everything alright
And when I feel like I'm lost something tells me you're here with me
And I can always find my way when you are here

[Verse 2]
And every word I didn't say that caught up in some busy day
And every dance on the kitchen floor we didn't have before
And every sunset that we'll miss I'll wrap them all up in a kiss
And pick you up in all of this when I sail away

[Chorus]
While I float along this ocean
I can feel you like a notion that I hope will never leave
Cause when I look to the sky something tells me you're here with me
And you make everything alright
And when I feel like I'm lost something tells me you're here with me
And I can always find my way when you are here

Whether I am up or down or in or out or just plane overhead
Instead it just feels like it is impossible to fly
But with you I can spread my wings
To see me over everything that life may send me

And when I feel like there is no one that will ever know me
There you are to show me

290,Bounce,"[Verse 1]
Living good, I've been living good
Rolling through my hood, understood
Just a youngin in this bitch up to no good
In the whip, every day with Nikki she be riding with me
Never trip, rolling through my city with hundreds and fifties
Out the blue, like a Crip
But I never bang, no, they know
We've been at it way before the fame, ho
(Way before the fame)
We've been at it way before the fame, ho
(Way before the...)
We've been at it way before the fame, psyche
Take a trip, little trip, life is what you make of it
I've been focused on this music, can't fuck with no basic bitch
Let me switch, the flow up, the flow up a little bit
No I ain't just tryna hit, hit, get with this
Bounce if you really 'bout it, but I doubt it, yes I do
Seems like all this new shit really just left over residue
I'm coming through, if I see your bitch I bet she coming too
What it do, we ain't never switch it up, we keep it true

[Chorus]
Out the blue, like a Crip
But I never bang though
They know, we've been at it way before the fame, ho
Way before the fame, ho
At it way before the, way before the fame ho (Bounce)

[Verse 2]
Back again, like I never left
Had to take a breath
Cause Nikki been fucking with me hardcore
God, goddamn, that's my fucking jam
They know who I am
Bitch bounce, homie smoke a ounce
Fuck it, make it count
With my album date announced, I pronounce I'm a killa
Bumping everything from Project Pat to Dilla
It's, truly disgusting the amount of money that we gross
Coast to coast, nationwide tour, then we hit the world
Rub a dub, if your bitch bad, we might hit your girl
RattPack, know the deal
What's the motto? Keep it real!
(I know) I got it, I want it, I need it
We live in an era where they get deleted
I'm wondering if I'ma make it
Man fuck it, I'll take it, that record I'll break it
These bitches they love it, but I never covet
I just keep it going that's why I be flowing
I'm already knowing this life that I'm living
Don't know what I'm given
It's so hard not to give in

[Chorus]
Out the blue, like a Crip
But I never bang though
They know, we've been at it way before the fame, ho
Way before the fame, ho
At it way before the, way before the fame ho (Bounce)

Damn, baby; I can't do it that fast...
But I know somebody who can, Twista!

Got you looking at the gliss' on my hands and wrists
While I'm laying back and smoking on my cannabis
When it come to rocking the rhythm like Marvin and Luther

In the Chi, and I be sipping Hennessy
Play some R&B while I smoke a B
You can't fuck with me, put that on a G
And all is (Well well well well)
Come with me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne
You ain't know Twista can work it like The Whispers?
Hit the stop light, movin' to some Ides
His rims still moving so I bump a little Spinners
While I'm smoking on a B, dipping through the streets
Bumping R&B, and I got the heat on them 23's
And I do it (Well well well well)
With my Earth in the Wind smokin' Fire
Let me get your sheets wet listening to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze with Maze
Fulfilling her with every temptation, slow-jamming, having deep sex
You Ready for the World, girl? Come on go with me
I'll touch you all over your body, baby don't say no to me
And every note'll be controlling me
I'm loving the way you be holding me when I be listening to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend your ass
You be bumpin' Teddy Pendergrass
I done hit it from the back to the melody of ""Roll It Slow""
Now I gotta go up in it fast, but I'mma finish last
No matter how much of a thug, you see
I still spit it like its R&B, go to the club with me
And with some Luther come on
I hope you feelin' me and still gon' be in love with me, and I ride...

Well I'll never forget the first time that I heard
That pretty mouth say that dirty word
And I can't even remember now what she backed my truck into
But she covered her mouth and her face got red
And she just looked so darn cute
That I couldn't even act like I was mad
Yeah I live for little moments like that

[Verse 2]
Well that's just like this last year on my birthday
She lost all track of time and burnt the cake
And every smoke detector in the house was going off
And she was just about to cry until I took her in my arms
And I tried not to let her see me laugh
Yeah I live for little moments like that

[Verse 3]
I know she's not perfect but she tries so hard for me
And I thank god that she isn't cause how boring would that be
It's the little imperfections it's the sudden change in plans
When she misreads the directions and we're lost but holding hands
Yeah I live for little moments like that

[Verse 4]
When she's laying on my shoulder on the sofa in the dark
And about the time she falls asleep so does my right arm
And I want so bad to move it cause it's tingling and it's numb
But she looks so much like an angel that I don't want to wake her up

When she steals my heart again and doesn't even know it

In my daughter's eyes everyone is equal
Darkness turns to light and the
World is at peace
This miracle God gave to me
Gives me strength when I am weak
I find reason to believe
In my daughter's eyes
And when she wraps her hand around my finger
Oh it puts a smile in my heart
Everything becomes a little clearer
I realize what life is all about
It's hanging on when your heart has had enough
It's giving more when you feel like giving up
I've seen the light
It's in my daughter's eyes
In my daughter's eyes I can see the future
A reflection of who I am and what will be
Though she'll grow and someday leave
Maybe raise a family
When I'm gone I hope you see
How happy she made me
For I'll be there

With everybody in the ring at the same time and no-one waiting for the band to start
I think it's gonna blow the show apart
Life is a movie, we are the actors
But everybody's going round all thinking they should be the one to get the starring part
There's gonna be a lot of broken hearts

Feel like a rider in a wild west show
Caught up in a rodeo
I don't know which way to go

Life is an ocean, I want to swim it
I don't know which way I should go if I should ever want to try and find the nearest shore
Or if it's even what I'm looking for
Life is a mountain, I want to climb it
If I go up I have to stop if I go down I only get to where I've been before
I think there's got to be a little more

Feel like a rider in a wild west show
Caught up in a rodeo
I don't know which way to go

Can someone tell me what is going on, give me directions and I'll meet you there
If it's a joke it's going on too long, we've had all the thrills none of the fun of the fair
This roller coasters going much too fast, don't think we're gonna make it round the bend
I'm breathing every breath as if it is my last, hold on to your hats I think we're going round again

Life's a game of football, but no-ones watching
'Cause everybody's on the pitch and going mad cause there is on-one who can find the ball
It's gonna turn into a free for all

Feel like a rider in a wild west show
Caught up in a rodeo
I don't know which way to go",After the Fire,2004,"[88, 85, 86, 86, 86, 88, 92, 93, 94]",9
302,In My Life,"[Verse 1: John Lennon with Paul McCartney]
There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all

[Verse 2: John Lennon with Paul McCartney]
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new

[Verse 3: John Lennon with Paul McCartney]
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more

303,I Wanna Do It All,"[Verse 1]
I was sitting in traffic for the fifth year in a row
Wasting my time just to get where I don't even wanna go
I started jotting things down on a Krispy Kreme sack
Everything I'd do if I could leave this place and never look back

[Chorus]
I wanna do it all
Visit Paris in the fall
Watch the Yankees play ball
I wanna take it all in
Catch a few beads down at Mardi Gras
Start a tradition, lay down the law
I wanna do it all

[Verse 2]
I wanna drink tequila down in Tijuana
Say, ""why not"" when somebody says, ""hey do you wanna""
I wanna get my heart broke once or twice
Settle down with the love of my life
Rock little babies to sleep at night

[Chorus]
I wanna do it all
Visit Paris in the fall
Watch the Yankees play ball
I wanna take it all in
Catch a few beads down at Mardi Gras
Start a tradition, lay down the law
I wanna do it all

I wanna spend today, every now and then
Just doing what I wanna do
When I wanna do it
(I wanna do it all)
Anytime I wanna do it

I wanna do it all
Visit Paris in the fall
Watch the Yankees play ball
I wanna take it all in
Catch a few beads down at Mardi Gras
Start a tradition, lay down the law
I wanna do it all

I have found the only one, only one that is meant for
Me
You're always on my mind, I'll go through whatever
Me and you will ride into eternity
Baby we can go places
Maybe a trip around the world
As you and I look up into the clouds
I keep tellin' myself I gotta tell him how I feel
Inside
I guess I la-la but I keep holdin' back
Cause I don't wanna scare you away
Yeah, it's just me, so frustrated I wish I'd say it
Naturally
My heart is racing, cause boy I want you constantly
Me and you and now chemistry, huh
It's so amazing that I want it more
But I can't help but think that you have someone else
Don't wanna pay my mind attention this way
I try to block it out
All this time with you
I can't believe I have a doubt
I'm so crazy but you could save me
Baby, please let me know you're in love with me

I'm telling stories in my head now I can't sleep at
Night
(Baby you donno why)

Nothing's gonna change
I'm always by your side, this is forever
Like the stars my love will shine next to your heart
What's all around me baby I don't care
Your face is all I see when you're not here
And I'm so surprised though I get carried away
I could lose a day from thinkin' you might not feel the
Same
But let me just say, I gotta turn it up
Cause it don't matter, maybe it's time but trust what I
Feel
And I just need your love to follow me
Cause now you know that you're my world, my everything
Everything
Now baby when I sleep at night I close my eyes and
Smile
And when I'm kissing you I feel my body light up inside
I hope you never ever think about letting me go
If I don't have you baby I would rather be on my own
What we have is so untouchable, unbreakable, and we
Will go on and on

306,Through The Wire,"[Music Video]
[Produced by Kanye West]

[Intro]
Yo, Gee, they can't stop me from rappin', can they?
Can they, Hop?

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Over Chorus]
I spit it through the wire, man
There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man
I'd gladly risk it all right now
It's a life-or-death situation, man
Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man
It's your boy, Kanye to the…
Chi-Town, what's goin' on?

[Verse 1]
I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizzerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band
I swear, this right here, history in the makin', man

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Over Chorus]
I really apologize for everything right now
If it's unclear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut
For like… I dunno, the doctor said like six weeks
Y'know, he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
I looked in the mirror
And half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man
This what I got to say right here, dawg
Yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh

[Verse 2]
What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds
It was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!)
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I…
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Outro Over Chorus]
Y'know what I'm sayin'?
When the doctor told me I had, um
That I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin, I said
""Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?""
""It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!""

Feeding off the souls that are lost and crying
Rails of sin, only evil remains

You can find redemption staring back into your eyes
There is protection and there's peace the same:

Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

316,Work It (Reinvention),"It was 2007, and I couldn’t remember the last time I’d done anything that felt exciting or youthful or new. I bought a ticket to visit an old friend who’d been living in Berlin for six years, paying a hundred euros a month to live in an unrenovated prewar apartment. Delia had a wide balcony and no discernible line of work. It was midsummer, when Berlin endures only three or four hours of actual darkness, and the air is soft and heavy with desire, clear with vast possibility. In the early evenings we lolled around, drinking cheap beer on the overgrown grass fringe of the canal in the stalled sunset radiance, thick with the scent of untamed green, and later we went out, each night until long past dawn, biking all over the city with a rotating cast of international dubiety—paint-spattered people with unidentifiable accents—dancing at Rio, at WMF, at Bar25, at Club der Visionäre, at Weekend, the last of which had just been written up in the most detailed Berlin-is-the-place-of-the-now sally the New York Times had yet produced. I cannot account for what we did during the day, if we did anything at all.

Everyone I encountered in Berlin seemed to have the freedom—economically and culturally—to do exactly what he or she pleased. What was important was what was happening right now. Nobody seemed to hold anybody to account. It wasn’t like San Francisco or New York, where the first question anybody asked at a party was what you did for a living, and the second was where you lived and how much you paid to live there. The other reason was that, perhaps because of that freedom, Berlin felt like the center of something surprising and important, and I couldn’t help thinking it would be a good place for an aspiring writer. The rumors of a new Lost Generation were a terrible cliché, but it was hard to resist them.

I applied for a Fulbright, figuring I could do with at least the imprimatur of institutional legitimacy. My proposal—some essay I planned never to write about contemporary young German novelists, about whom I knew exactly nothing—was the sort of thing I’d been advised the committee wanted to hear, and I got it.

Twenty-seven was an unusual age to move to Berlin, but I’d always had a precocious sense of crisis, and my decision to go was spurred at least in part by my fantasy that I might be able to stave off future regret. I felt like I owed the experience to some subsequent self. Everybody else in Berlin was either twenty-two, just out of leafy liberal arts colleges and in flight from the responsibilities ahead, or they were thirty-nine, just out of a career or a relationship and in flight from the responsibilities behind. For my part, I moved there as a kind of preemptive strike, reasoning that if I bolted while I could, in my late twenties, I wouldn’t bolt when I couldn’t, in my forties, or maybe more specifically at approximately forty-six, when my dad left his marriage and moved in with Brett, a lovely guy he met at the gym, and my brother and I could never get in touch with him about car insurance or baseball games because the two of them were always disappearing to the nightclubs of Key West or Palm Springs. They e-mailed self-portraits in sailor suits from themed Atlantis cruises down Baja. My dad’s justification for this, in those moments when he felt as though he needed to produce one, was that he was claiming the outré adolescence he’d been denied. He’d lived a life long on sacrifice and short on pleasure, and had begun, at last, to live the life he deserved. “Deserved” was his word.

More than anything, his two mistakes—first, not living the life he wanted; and, second, believing this had been a sacrifice that freed him from all future sacrifices, like having dinner with his children when he wanted to stay longer at the bar, or treating their mother with any respect—were what I hoped to avoid. I explained my fear of regret in terms of how unusually clearly my dad’s life—in which a bad, perhaps even cowardly decision made in his twenties became a thirties of anxiety, a forties of resentment, and a fifties of abandon—exemplified the great cost of not having acted as one wished when one still had time.

I thought that perhaps my dad’s problem was that he hadn’t had enough experience, that he’d chosen a career and a marriage before he knew what else was out there, and I didn’t want to make the same error. Experiencewise, I wanted what I thought everybody wanted: to go to secret parties with artist/DJs that people in Brooklyn hadn’t even heard of, or to sleep with as many people as, say, Tom, so that when I got back into a committed relationship it wouldn’t be for the mere sake of being in one but because I’d chosen that person. Those were the reasons I gave for moving to Berlin. Or at least, those were the excuses I gave for moving to Berlin.

I arrived in time for a few days of lingering late summer. I took the U-Bahn from the airport, dropped my stuff at a sublet, spent my first euros on a pack of cigarettes, and walked slowly down the Karl-Marx-Allee toward Delia’s apartment feeling alone and free and already different. My first night in town was Delia’s send-off, which seemed cruelly unfortunate at the time. (Later I understood it was a common enough coincidence: every day somebody arrived and somebody else left.) I arrived at her apartment to find the German national women’s Ultimate Frisbee team running around in their underwear in the living room while the men smoked on the balcony, trying to decide where we’d all go later, if the women decided to put their pants back on.

In Berlin it thus seemed, from that first night’s demented relaxation into morning, as though everything was up in the air at all hours; no possibility was foreclosed. The local custom was to commit to as little as possible, and by “local custom” I do not mean “German custom.” If the twentieth century had taught anybody anything at all, it was that Germans had lousy customs. Hence Berlin’s appeal: there was no cultural arbitration. My colleagues in Paris had the futile errand of trying to resemble the French. Those in Beijing competed in the absurd contest of trying to understand China. In Tokyo, or in London, or in Moscow, your sunlit hours had to have some nontrivial relationship to the economy. Berlin was an experiment in total freedom from authority, an infinitely long weekend with your parents out of town. It felt like an anti-gravity chamber. The old crimes licensed you to ignore the claims of the past; the low cost of living licensed you to ignore the demands of the present; and the future was something that would happen when we moved back to New York, where many of us would once more live in uncomfortable proximity to our actual parents, and where people talked about real estate and restaurants.

It was not that I did not like talking about restaurants. It’s normal to like talking about restaurants. But in Berlin when we talked about restaurants, it was the cheap kebab places; this was part of the ritual by which we acknowledged the aspects of our Berlin existence that differentiated us from our friends at home. We, and now I mean the people I came to love in Berlin, David Levine and Alix and Emilie, often felt like survivors whose home planet had become glutted with condos bought by people who waited in line for cupcakes, and we congratulated ourselves and one another on having gotten out just in time. This gave our decision to do as little of consequence as possible—with this ocean of space and profligacy of hours—the legitimate pretext of cultural and economic protest. We rebelled against the authority of rent and cupcakes.

In theory, this chartered us to do whatever we pleased whenever we wanted. In practice, it meant we spent a lot of time wondering what we wanted to do, and if we wanted to do anything at all. Or maybe that was just me. Part of my anti-regret crusade involved making sure I was always doing just what I felt like, which mostly meant keeping myself open for things that might come up, saying yes to whatever distraction happened along. It was an extremely active kind of passivity and it went swimmingly at night, when things were always coming up: there were gallery openings and bars and clubs, all elbowy with asymmetrical people proving provocative until breakfast. The daytimes were another matter; then it was less clear what the most vital and necessary and memorable experience available might be. I went to Berlin with a whole shelf of unread books, books like Middlemarch, but every time I sat down hungover in a café at eleven a.m. with that copy of Middlemarch, the whole day open before me, I inevitably thought to myself, Why move to Berlin to read Middlemarch? I could read Middlemarch in San Francisco (though, naturally, I hadn’t). The whole point of living in Berlin was being an agent in the world of total possibility. Was reading Middlemarch the thing I most desired to do in that particular hour? It wasn’t easy to say. Ordinarily I had to put the book down and go on a walk to think it over, to make sure I was maximizing the value of my experience. These often turned into some pretty long walks. When I got back to the neighborhood from my walks, I sat around the Turkish bakery with Alix, or I went with her to check out the newer galleries up in Wedding. When I was with Alix, I felt as though there was nothing else in the world I’d rather be doing. When she was busy I went to see Wings of Desire.

Part of the point of Wim Wenders’s 1987 film, which I must’ve seen a dozen times in that first year, is that Berlin before the fall of the Wall had long been an inertial place, a sort of vacuum. There was no industry in the West; factory owners were afraid the Soviets would blockade the city, as they had shortly after the war. The banks were in grimy Frankfurt, technology and automobiles were in bourgeois Munich and arrogant Stuttgart, the press was in wealthy Hamburg, the provisional government in boring Bonn. West Berlin was merely a symbol of resistance, a great series of photo ops, and America was happy to help pay for it as long as it continued to provide such good press. East Berlin was just as unreal. It was a Communist set, the utopian socialism of the future, but it was also a big, expensive mock-up. The rest of the country was bankrupted by the purchase of ornamental tile for the wedding-cake palazzi that lined the Stalinallee (now the Karl-Marx-Allee I walked to Delia’s frisbee-underwear going-away). The Fernsehturm, or TV Tower, at Alexanderplatz, the city’s only height of note, had been built in 1969 as a present to the Volk from their twenty-year-old puppet government. They’d had to use Western technology and Swedish engineers, and the people were already picking up TV signals from the free side of the city. After the Wall went up, in 1961, there was never anything of true geopolitical importance at stake. Its construction wasn’t an escalation but a diffusion: it made the conflict not political but rhetorical, for the benefit of the media.

The movie follows two angels as they bum around the city. One of them becomes smitten with a doleful French trapeze artist, and his feelings for her convince him to leap from eternity into time. Peter Falk, playing himself as a former angel, encourages Damiel’s transition. In the scene where he first wakes up as a mortal, he asks a passerby for help. The man teaches him the words for the colors in the graffiti on the Wall—his life until then had been in black and white—and then gives him change for his first hot coffee and pack of cigarettes. He gulps the black coffee, his eyes wide.

This had always evoked what felt like a disproportionate response in me; it wasn’t the sort of movie that was supposed to make you cry. On some level it was probably just because I was lonely and indecisive, sitting yet again by myself on a Tuesday at one in the afternoon at the Kino Babylon or at the Moviemento, and because it ends with the inevitability of an enduring romance, which already seemed impossibly remote in libertine Berlin. But it wasn’t just that. The citizens of divided Berlin were marooned on an island outside of time. Their ability to do what they wanted to do was thwarted by their historical circumstance. But once they, like the angel, were able to pass through the Wall, they would leave behind their suspended existence and enter the swift current of life.

When the angel wakes up as a mortal, he strides away from the Wall with the assurance and the joy of the convalescent. He’s so giddy to have time—to have finite time, time that now counts for precisely something because its quantity is fixed—that he knows just how he’s going to use it. I’d been so entranced by this image that I’d missed the crucial prelude, the process by which his desires crystallize and he understands why he wants to be free: to share a fleeting life with his trapeze artist. In moving to Berlin, I was working (or not working, as the case may have been) on the assumption that a grand gesture was itself enough—that, in the wake of the decision to uproot myself, my true desires would emerge to fill the vacuum. In the nineties Wenders made a sequel to the movie that I’d never seen; the last thing I wanted to know was what happened next.

But I realize now I should have known what would happen next. One of the very first things I’d heard upon arrival in Berlin was a line from the 1920s feuilletonist Karl Scheffler: Berlin ist dazu verdammt, immerfort zu werden, niemals zu sein. Berlin is damned always to become and never to be. It was such a seductive idea, that the city would never grow fusty or calcific and that, by proxy, you would never become fusty or calcific. And if a place was always becoming, there was no time for belatedness, no great era you’d missed out on, no cost to frittering away your time doing this or that. But we were, I was, so easily seduced, I missed the part about damned.

*

For a while there, at the beginning, starting with that Frisbee panty party, things were genuinely fizzy and I didn’t at all mind spending my days just walking around and my nights saying yes to whatever happened to present itself. Just being there felt glorious, or, more than glorious, felt like enough. We felt like participants. The cigarettes, those endless stockpiles of cigarettes, and the coffee really did taste different, as they always do in a new place, and drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes felt like sufficient acts. Cigarettes marked off the time. For the few minutes one lasted, you knew exactly what you were doing: you were smoking that cigarette. When it was done, you would figure out what to do next, or you would just light another.

I arrived in Berlin with ten e-mail addresses. The first person I met, Emilie, looked at my list and said I needn’t bother e-mailing the rest; she knew them all, and I’d see them the next day at the big gallery opening. Her friend Alix was coming along, and I’d love her.

We met at Emilie’s place first, in a cobbled and uncharacteristically pretty street behind Arkonaplatz. Alix’s name was pronounced in the French style, ah-LEEX, and she arrived with a duffel bag big enough for a body.

“Where did you just come from?” I asked. “A trip? Hockey practice?”

“Nowhere,” Alix said. She’s thin and angular and striking, with pointy elbows, long, nervous fingers, and deep-set almond eyes. She has a soft rumpled tide of unruly hair and glows with a cold marmoreal light. She opened the bag and changed in front of us, into a billowy unbelted stained silk dress and Thirty Years’ War–vintage combat boots tourniqueted at the ankles.

The economic, cultural, and psychological draws of Berlin—the sheer amounts of time and space that in other cities would be taken up by day jobs or the steady emotional drain of long-standing friendships; the almost religiously shared belief in the possibility of personal reinvention; and an addiction to the promise of the new—made for a robust art scene, at least according to various multilingual periodicals. This opening was at the new outpost of a huge London gallery. The room, or rather the space—nothing took place in something as banal as a room—had the size and character of a well-swept munitions depot, and probably had served as one once. Everything in Berlin happened in a former somewhere: the former sanitation-technology factory in the Ritterstraße, the former pretzel factory in the Prenzlauer Allee, the dome of the former post office in the Oranienburgerstraße that now had a restaurant/club that would only take reservations via text message to a secret number, the former department-store-vault club that was now in the former basement of the former (current?) power station, and of course the former dentist’s office, which the white tiles heated up like a sauna. All of these rooms had been liberated from their erstwhile indebtedness to productivity.

In the former munitions depot, people dressed in lab coats angled through the crowd with purpose, and I assumed they were caterers. Once I’d become a little more familiar with art, I’d look back and wonder if they hadn’t been part of the installation, or, once I felt as though I knew even more about art, if they’d possibly been both caterers and part of the installation. After the opening we got into a cab and went to a party in Kreuzberg hosted by a fragile, fey artist in a black feathered boa and his bloodshot gallerist, who was wearing a T-shirt that said “Vulva Vaginal Scent” and chewing on lollipops. I texted a friend in San Francisco, described these guys, and asked if they were anybody I should feel pleased to be at a party with. He wrote: FAMOUS GUY SAATCHI ART CAVE OF DICKS. I tried nonchalantly to ask Emilie what CAVE OF DICKS meant and she said that the guy in the black feathered boa had once made a cave of dicks. Actual live dicks. They hung down from unsuckably distant glory holes in the ceiling.
A sometimes-celebrated young conceptual artist who, I was told, was always on the prowl found out I was a writer and asked me to help him craft a text message to a chick photographer on assignment for Vice in Stockholm. He had thick tortoiseshell glasses and whined with refinement. He assumed I was an art critic, as most everyone did when I introduced myself as a writer, and asked me about magazines.

“Have you ever written for Domus? No? But you’ve heard of Domus, right? What about Precept? Not that, either? Yeah, it’s weird, me neither, I hadn’t heard of them until recently. There are just all these magazines, and it’s weird, all of them profile me. And you’re, like, what are you, you know? Are you art magazines or fashion magazines or what, when you profile me?” He named more magazines. “Uovo. Texte zur Kunst. 032c, Bidoun, Monopol, mono.kultur. So many. Texte zur Kunst.”

Alix swooped in and delivered me onto a roof to smoke, though of course you could smoke inside too. She rolled her eyes and promised that there was more to the art scene here than naming magazines. There were, to be fair, some very fine artists. There was Omer, a gruff Israeli who made multichannel video installations; there was the pretty much just Danish guy who made a big deal about being Icelandic and had a dirigible hangar and eighty pretty assistants; there was Maxime, a French kid in his early twenties who shot the kind of harsh and tender photographs one might have seen on Nan Goldin’s Facebook page; and there was Ignacio, who’d spent ten years in an office job making private artworks out of thousand-cell Excel spreadsheets. However, with the exception of Maxime, who had to stay out late enough for his friends to start tattooing each other so he could take pictures of them to put online, the really good artists didn’t seem to go out that much.

“Let’s get out of here,” Alix said, and took me to Bar Drei, where we sat until seven o’clock in the morning. There was no art space in Berlin more interesting than Bar Drei, and it wasn’t an art space at all. It looked like a gallery that had dispensed with the pretext of art entirely in favor of the unimpeachable idea of charging money for the free drinks. It was a fishbowl on a lonely corner behind the Volksbühne and had no sign save a large “3” stenciled on the door. The bar itself was a triangle of black Formica countertop in the center of the room, its vertices rounded off, so sitting at it made you feel as though you were a member of some deliberative post-tribal council of the future. The walls to the street were enormous windows. Everyone went there after the openings, or, as you got smarter about things, you skipped the openings and went straight to Drei, which was like an opening but with chairs. That was all anybody wanted at an opening, anyway, were chairs. The only other furnishings at Drei were black spherical bulbs that hung on cords at even intervals over the bar, like soft interrogation lamps; they weren’t fixed to anything and the only thing that would get you kicked out was pendulating them. Drei hired mostly artists, both Americans and Germans, as bartenders, and part of their art practice—I assumed this had something to do with the art world’s recent infatuation with something called “relational aesthetics”—was never keeping precise tabs. At the end of the night there was always a tense but pleasurable negotiation about the matter of what to pay.

Drei, I came to see as I became part of it, had an astonishingly regular clientele. Berlin was a city where three quarters of the population couldn’t drag itself out of bed before noon, but if there was one place that made people reliable, it was Drei. It was safe to assume that on any given evening, between the closing of the openings and the opening of the clubs, most of the people I came to know would be there. Some people I knew I saw only there. I met David Levine at Drei; and Zhivago, a beefy and voluble half-Danish, half-Syrian installation artist who grew up between Sacramento, Paris, and Valletta, and spoke at least eight languages, all of them fluently, none of them natively; and Carson, the gentle czar of the international-art-expat scene, who ran a noncommercial space devoted to intersections of art and architecture, dressed in sheer and tasteful varieties of drapery, and was always off to Osaka or Cap d’Antibes or Istanbul for a biennial or panel; and the other David, who painted surgically enhanced women in oils with textbook anatomical precision and spent three hours each day at the gym and seven hours each night smoking; and the style bloggers; and the Norwegian video artists; and, a little while later, the younger guys with the Internet-based work. In the summer everyone sat around on the monument outside, the one to all the lost and forgotten monuments, and in the winter the smoke was so thick inside that nobody had to smoke at all.

But Bar Drei didn’t open until nine-thirty at night, which still left the matter of the daytime. As far as doing nothing was concerned, if you couldn’t be an artist, you could at least be Jewish; in a way all the Americans in Berlin were honorary Jews. (Many of them were actual Jews.) In the first quarter of the twentieth century the saying used to go that “every Berliner comes from Breslau,” from the shtetls of the Pale of Settlement. They also said that “the Jew comes from the East and has no time.” He was an avatar of restless commercial modernity. These days the Jew comes from the West and has more time than he knows what to do with. He is an avatar of restless noncommercial modernity. I got by in that first year by writing up cranky little dispatches for a Web-based Jewish magazine out of New York that allowed the Jewishness of my content to be glancing.

The main trouble, it seemed to me, was that American Jews and Germans felt as though they needed to say something to one another, but never quite knew what. My mom, a rabbi and a psychoanalyst, came to visit for my first Thanksgiving, and we toured the standard Jewish monuments and memorials. Her feeling about the monuments and the memorials, like her feelings about anything in general, was that it was important to keep the conversation going, that the only way toward healing is through talk. I told her that of course I tended to agree with her, but that the problem in Berlin was that the conversational partners just didn’t match up. It often felt as though Germans over a certain age—twenty-five, say—wanted something from you, some sign that everything had finally become okay. I mostly did think that everything had become okay, but I never felt entitled to say that. After all, I hadn’t any personal connection to the Holocaust. The people who could offer real forgiveness were dead, or they were dying.

The ubiquity of these conversational templates made it impossible to forget I was Jewish. In the States it was something I’d never thought much about, which had always struck my friends as strange. They assumed that I, as the son of two rabbis, would have a strong religious commitment. But my parents had been savvy enough to know that if they made a big deal out of observance, we’d certainly end up defecting; so—with the exception of weekly Shabbat dinners at home and High Holiday attendance and large annual seders—they left it up to us, which meant we’d ended up mostly like normal, suburban, disaffected cultural Jews. Our Jewishness meant Woody Allen and latkes, like anybody else’s.

But in Berlin this ambivalent patrimony was foisted upon you. It was immediately clear that Jews had a certain purchase in Berlin; as David Levine let me quote him in one of my first columns, “They really know how to torque it.” I decided at a certain point that I liked those Jews best who were a little interested in the Holocaust, who liked to talk a few minutes of Holocaust now and then, technical stuff, mostly. These were often academics, like my friend who was writing a dissertation about the few exiles who returned, against their wives’ protests, to help rebuild German universities after the war. But a healthy relationship to the Holocaust wasn’t the norm. Melodrama was easier, more cheaply satisfying, and it was one way to explain to yourself what you were doing in Germany: just existing there was an act of defiance and strength. Being a Jew in New York is a mark of some considerable banality, but being a Jew in Berlin makes you special. You have the Holocaust in your pocket, the run of a city you rightly deserve.

There was the feeling that the Holocaust got you off the hook, only furthering the idea that you were in Berlin to do just as you pleased, sleep with whomever you felt like, even if she had a boyfriend. It allowed you to be contemptuous of the Germans, gave you an excuse to ignore the local culture. Or you could be obsequious, make a big deal out of how little you cared about the Holocaust, how much you despised the “Shoah industry,” how awful the histrionics of Libeskind. Jews like this were ambassadors; they found it in themselves to congratulate the Germans for having gotten over the past, which often—counterintuitively—meant congratulating themselves for having overcome their own fraught Jewish-American identity. It was a gesture of forgiveness that had everything to do with the forgiver and little to do with the forgiven. It was forgiveness as power, as arrogance.

This was all true, in an inverse way, about the Germans too. They reveled in their powerlessness. For them simply not being a Nazi counted as an accomplishment. For decades they had done really fine work not being Nazis—unlike the Austrians, who were still basically Nazis. The Germans had made not being Nazis into a central plank of their identity, and, as with the Jews, that meant they could be absolved of other ambitions.

As uncomfortable as it made me, it was often easiest just to give in to the sense of Holocaust-related entitlement. Sometimes this took the form of standard guilt. When the synagogue in the Rykestraße reopened to great fanfare, I felt I had to go at least hear Kol Nidre, and I did, though I left after fifteen minutes. Other times it took odder forms, like the habit I developed of walking around listening to Paul Célan read “Todesfuge” on my iPod. But most of the time these feelings were desublimated, more crassly manifested. At a birthday party for an Icelandic artist a young and beautiful German Goth reclined in a bathtub. The bathtub was in the kitchen; it pulled down from a closet between the sink and the stove, like a Murphy bed. She lolled against the dry porcelain and told me she’d just finished her degree in   Anti-Semitism Studies, with a focus on the post-Shoah relationship between West Germany and Israel. My friend Max was tall and handsome and obviously Jewish and made a habit of this sort of thing, and I pulled him aside to ask for the encouraging advice I knew he’d give. “The only way we—Germans and Jews alike—will heal these old wounds,” he said, “is if we take seriously our duty, difficult as it may often be, to take women like that home.”

The person who pulled off the bohemian thing most convincingly—that is, neither self-consciously nor apologetically—was Emilie, which was funny, because Emilie was also the only one of us who had an actual job—in fact, a whole series of them. The rest of us had come to Berlin to escape the authority of work, but Emilie hustled. She was always on the phone, screaming at someone in German customs to free up a six-foot carved totem from Uttar Pradesh in time for an opening that night; or running a gallery while her boss languished in Moabit Prison on charges of fraud (later acquitted); or curating a genuinely good group show in a former brewery, featuring work by some of our friends and later written up on the style-and-art-blog circuit by other of our friends. But she also managed to party as though it were her job. She worked harder than anybody I knew.

Emilie’s life may have been in a constant state of crisis, but it was never an existential crisis. They were practical crises. Some of them might have landed her in bureaucratic labyrinths or trapped her on Baltic islands with street-art-dealing aristocrats, but none of them ever seemed to make her wonder why she was in Berlin, which was something she could be specific about: she sold art. One of the nice things about Berlin was that you didn’t have to be specific if you didn’t feel like it. If somebody asked you what you were up to in town, you could say you were an artist or just interested in art and leave it at that. They didn’t need to know anything more, didn’t have to worry you were withholding anything, because in part what you were communicating was that you probably weren’t a hundred percent sure what you were doing there. But your erstwhile interrogator almost certainly wasn’t sure what she was doing there, either, so everybody could get away with being broad-brush about things. This obtained in general. Part of the liberation of Berlin in Berlin was the permission to be vague.

Emilie was different, though. She was good at the specific thing she did during the day, knew the right ways to talk to artists and collectors. She paid taxes, had been audited, had an expensive couch she tried not to get too many cigarette holes in. She was also loyal, and loyal in a way nobody in Berlin ever seemed to try very hard to be. She had principles, made a point of never sleeping with anybody her friends had slept with, and never cheated. Rarely cheated. All of these things were of a piece. The rest of us, at a certain point, began to worry that we were going out too much, felt mildly concerned that we were somehow betraying our true selves by not feeling held to account, not getting enough done—enough of what done we could rarely say—but Emilie never had that problem. She got done during the day what she had to get done and she did at night what she wanted to do. She was comfortable with her desire for some things because she was obligated to do others; she was able to oblige some things because she desired others. She bore the same relationship to us that Micah bore to the friends he had in Shanghai—shortly after I abandoned him he put in for a transfer overseas—who were always arguing about whose Mandarin had the best tones. Micah just went to the factory in Suzhou or Zhuhai or Taiyuan and got on with it.

Emilie, so confident about how she spent her time, was the closest thing we had to a true doyenne, and she could have posted up at Bar Drei with the rest of us. But she was cut out for demimonde grandeur, and was delighted to include anybody who wanted in. For a while Emilie dated an endearingly feckless East German named Kevin, a sweet case study in the most extreme psychological effects of the nanny state. Kevin was notionally a DJ, but sometimes he was so busy partying, he would forget to play music; when he remembered, though, everybody had a good time, and even when he forgot, it was okay. At the beginning we’d hang out in his studio—he was also, notionally, a photographer—and he’d spin records. He and his studio-mate called the place the Bernsteinzimmer, the “Amber Room,” after the alleged hoard of still-missing Nazi gold. His DJ name was Kevin9/11 until Emilie forced him to change it. Then he called himself Kevolution. Emilie sighed and gave up.

They had a pretty good relationship for a while, one mostly based on mutual respect for the intensity with which the other could party. Their terms of endearment were party related. “Du bist die Partymäuschen,” they would say with affectionate accuracy. “You are the little party mouse.”

At four-thirty one December weekday morning, at the close of what felt like my first semester in Berlin, we left Kevolution behind at the Bernsteinzimmer to play or not play records as he continued to see fit. It was Alix’s birthday and we were near the Prenzlauer Berg–Pankow border. Emilie had heard about a new club, and six or ten of us were wandering around in the chilly dark looking for it. As we walked past one of the entrances to the Mauerpark, a disputably green zone where a strip of no-man’s-land once was, she noticed a single votive candle on a sidewalk. She swerved into the black lane. Someone asked where she thought she was going.
“There’s a party in here,” she said, gesturing ahead of us into the dark. Someone asked how she knew.

“Did you not see the votive candle? Whenever you see votive candles, you follow them, and they take you to a rave.” We followed the votive candles a kilometer into the park. The tree branches stitched a starless canopy against the black sky. Somebody picked his or her way along in heels. We tried to turn back.

“Do whatever you like,” Emilie said, “but I’m going to this party.”

“This is bonkers,” Alix said, and shivered.

We walked for twenty more minutes, rounded a corner, and came through a copse to a Weimar-era toolshed. Inside there was a spectacular rave, with several rooms of music, an enormous amount of barely nibbled Turkish Fladenbrot, hundreds of people.
“This is bonkers,” Alix said, and we went to dance. We left Emilie there at eight thirty in the morning and took the M10 tram in a wide arc back to our side of town. The streets were just beginning to steep in the squalid sub-lactic half-light of a winter Thursday. Commuters read nationalist tabloids of anti-immigrant sentiment. Alix folded herself under my arm and fell asleep, I had nothing to do for the rest of the day, and life to me felt almost unbearably full.

*

There was some pretense, in Berlin, of sexual adventure as part of the never-ending audition in recklessness. A close friend, Jordan, complained that his cohort, all the pretty young ubiquitous art boys, had developed an orgy habit, and that he wanted no part in it. He was conservative, he said, and did not like to sleep with his friends; he just wanted a monogamous relationship with a nice man. He was twenty-three and modeled part-time; he spoke seven or eight languages, including Arabic and Polish and Japanese, and I was constantly telling him to quit his gallery job and get into a linguistics PhD program, where he belonged.

Jordan seemed to have healthy, unconflicted relationship to his sexuality, and we spent a lot of time talking about my dad. I told him that the main thing that had changed since my father came out was the innuendo. Actually, “innuendo” isn’t the right word, as it implies subtlety. There are many things for which you, or, more specifically, I, could reasonably blame my dad—deceit, say, or the sustained fantasy that a decade of complete and utter irresponsibility was the least the world owed him—but subtlety, especially about sex, is not one of them.

When I was a kid, there had been signs—mostly in his flickering moods—that he had another life. After he came out, everything was explicit. When I was in my early and mid-twenties, during the periods in which we were talking to each other, I would come through New York and we would meet for dinner or a drink in Chelsea. We would walk past a bar with blacked-out windows and a studded leathery stegosaural bouncer and he would roll his eyes and say something like, “Oh, God, the Rawhide. You really gotta keep your back to the wall in there.”

These stories made good anecdotes to trot out for my friends and girlfriends. They worked because they relied on the idea that I might have been expected to feel bad but instead took in the whole thing with detached amusement. My wacky gay-rabbi dad and his crude hijinks, I would imply, as if I were starring in the most progressive of sitcoms. I did not experience detached amusement. The innuendo always felt to me like bragging—bragging about the open eroticism of the life he led now, in contrast to his old, straitjacketed existence at home. This was, to some extent, the transparency I’d always wanted from him, but now it only made me feel lonely.

In turn I made a big deal about my endurance. The first time he took me to a gay bar, a New Jersey mansion dive in teak paneling and threadbare velour with the characteristically unimaginative gay-bar name of the Raven, I asked for a beer, he bought me a Cosmo, and then he walked off to greet some friends he and Brett had met at a club in Fort Lauderdale. I stood in the corner and sipped my Cosmo—I figured he was watching out for my carb intake—and did my best to avoid eye contact with what I was later told were called trolls. The next morning I called my then girlfriend, the one I’d hung around in San Francisco for, to complain about how exposed I’d felt under so much perverse late-middle-aged male scrutiny.

“Welcome,” she said, “to what it’s like to be a woman every single day.” I told that story for years, and the moral I made of her punch line was that everybody feels vulnerable sometimes and you ought to just get over yourself. In Berlin I went to gay bars all the time—which wasn’t hard, as in Berlin even the convenience stores often felt like de facto gay bars—to prove that I’d gotten over myself. For me this was the point of my dad’s Rawhide references: Get over yourself.

When I talked to Jordan about this, I was both looking for sympathy and trying to needle him; I was in part proud of my dad’s candor, his ability to be so unashamed of his desire, his apparent lack of hang-ups. “Jordan,” I said, “aren’t you selling out the revolutionary promise of homosexuality? What about the idea that the ethics of sexual loyalty is a hetero hang-up your kind has gloriously overcome in favor of the ethics of betrayal?” What about Genet—what about his sense that the traditional monogamous relationship was “something of a protection racket,” as Adam Phillips put it in a review of an Edmund White memoir. I promise to pretend as though you’re the only thing that could possibly make me happy, it says, and you promise the same thing, and we’ll surely make each other miserable. Genet’s counterproposal on behalf of his generation of homosexuals? An intimacy of anonymity. His idea, Phillips writes, was that “so-called relationships were the place where one needn’t take anything personally.”

Jordan was unfazed. “You just say that because you only fuck girls with boyfriends and you want to find some intellectual reason to think that’s okay, and because you know you yourself are dying for exactly that protection racket. You can’t stop looking for the perfect girl. Anyway, as far as gay people my age are concerned, what you’re talking about is the big problem with what your dad’s generation did to our generation. They grew up trying to be straight, so when they could finally fuck men, they went all crazy about it, and they still can’t stop fucking, and they’ve saddled us with the idea that gay life should always be this creepy free-for-all of fucking. But I’ve been gay since I knew how to talk, and all I want is my boyfriend and my dog, Miss Tilly, and a nice duvet and some DVDs. If you want to call that a protection racket, go right ahead, doll face. It’s what I want.”

But there was still a part of me that felt as though I had to grow up and into the ethics of betrayal, that part of coming to Berlin was getting over petty jealousy and the childish desire for an impossibly complete presence, and what felt so terrible so often wasn’t the old sadness and jealousy but the guilt about still being hung up in the same old ways.

The only artist who made work that seemed to address, in a serious and useful way, what was going on in Berlin—the absence of authority, the tyranny of desire—was David Levine. David was tall and muscular and perpetually stubbled, his jaundiced eyes open wide in frequent disbelief, and he spoke with a dark, feathery rasp. In summer he wore frayed wifebeaters and in winter thermal undershirts and motorcycle boots with the ringed trusses clipped off. You could imagine him smoking while working out, smoking while swimming. We had friends in common in New York, as everybody else did, and he had impressive and successful ex-girlfriends.

David was an experimental theater director and conceptual artist who thought the two worlds had something to learn from each other. Performance art had given up on the idea of rehearsal because it thought that authenticity could only derive from spontaneity, from unself-consciousness, which could make a performance feel uncanny and novel. But the authenticity part is always a red herring, David used to say. Well-acted, well-directed, and well-rehearsed theater could be just as moving, or as alienating, as any given performance-art tantrum. If you rehearse, if you employ all the traditional techniques the theater uses to create credibility, and only then take away the scaffolding, you could perhaps make something that would split the difference. Art doesn’t want to be seen as trying very hard, but the trick of the theater is that sometimes it’s only when you’re trying as hard as you possibly can that you seem effortless. David practiced forms of ritualized improvisation, or improvised ritual.

His first really big piece—called Bauerntheater, it had been written up at great length in the “Arts & Leisure” section of the Times—closed shortly before I arrived in town. He’d rehearsed an actor in the role of a potato farmer in a previously untranslated Heiner Müller play about East German agricultural collectivization in the fifties, then put the guy in a field about an hour outside of Berlin and had him plant potatoes in full costume in the regional style of the day. He’d gotten a large grant from the German cultural ministry to do this, and it had gotten him a lot of good press. An arts journalist friend of his wrote yet another thing about Berlin artists for a Manhattan magazine, and the big pull-quote was David’s. It concerned the differences between being an artist in Berlin and New York. “In New York,” he said, “if you’re not making a hundred grand and sleeping with a lesbian, you’re nothing.”

At Bar Drei one night after the story came out, he seemed distracted and I asked him why. “I’m worried,” he said, “that the story is going to piss off the lesbian I sleep with when I’m in New York.”

Alix put her cigarette out. “And I wonder if it’ll also piss off the German cultural ministry that made Bauerntheater possible by giving you a hundred grand.”

*

David Levine’s next project after Bauerntheater, the first one I was around for, was called The Gallery Will Be Relocating over the Summer. It was a fake art opening that took its name from the fact that the real gallery that hosted it was supposed to be relocating over the summer. Then the gallerist had a kid with a young Spanish artist, starting posting about the Andalusian weather on Facebook, and was never heard from again. The fake opening was a final project for his students in a class he was teaching at the Freie Universität. Each student spent an entire semester studying the habits and affects of an art-world person—an artist, curator, gallerist—and showed up in character for the performance at the gallery, in the Brunnenstraße. All the newer galleries back then were in the Brunnenstrasse and they would coordinate their monthly openings in a way that turned the street into a block party. These were my favorite evenings of that first year—drinking free beer in the nine p.m. sunlight, parading around in the street, knowing that everybody you knew in the whole city was on that block and was going to an after-party where everyone was there and nobody ever left—though the art was rarely very accomplished. David liked to say that the Brunnenstraße was where everybody got a chance. He didn’t mean that cynically.
“The most important thing to remember,” he said to me through the smoke at Bar Drei the day before his fake show was set to real open, “is that every artist is always making the best art he or she possibly can. You can call it bad art, if you want, and most of it is bad the way most of anything is bad, but there’s no grace in impugning the motivations behind it.”

I felt greedy and often impatient for these lopsided moments with David, moments of instruction and clarifying tenderness and even the occasional reprimand. Over time I tried harder not to press him into a vigilance he was neither interested in nor prepared for, and I was eager for chances to reciprocate, to show him I was just as interested in friendship as I was in oversight. So I was happy when David asked Alix and me to write the fake press release for his fake show. We took the job very seriously, spent hours outside at the Turkish bakery working on it, but in the end our draft wasn’t all that distinguishable from the real press release.

The fake opening had fake-real art on the walls, inspired by the real art of the characters under study, and real free booze, and a nonnegotiable locked-door duration of four hours. At seven p.m. David bicycle-locked the front door of the gallery. The only person inside in character as herself was an arts reporter in town, a friend of a friend whom we’d introduced to David at Bar Drei. He’d invited her to appear in the piece as herself, and she was flattered. “You’re like Peter Falk in Wings of Desire!” I said. She frowned.

The real opening, i.e., the opening of David’s show, was in the courtyard outside, where we milled and drank the same free booze the fake people were real-drinking inside. Occasionally we looked in through the window to see what the fake attendees were up to. What they were up to looked largely the same as what we were up to, which was part of the point, but we were afraid that they were having a better time. After all, they had been licensed by hard work and careful direction to spend a few hours being different people, which meant they were drunkenly rolling around on the floor and wrecking the artwork and making the most of it. This made an even better point. We were ourselves at a real event, which meant our hearts weren’t in it, not the way theirs were. We were freer, but they were surer of their roles and we couldn’t help but look over our shoulders at them.

The night was warm and there were a lot of free drinks and the after-party sounded increasingly auspicious and it had been a while, I realized, since I’d had such a nice time out at yet another art function in Berlin. The doors to the fake opening were unlocked at eleven. The New York arts reporter playing herself came out and held up her BlackBerry. Someone we knew in New York, or someone some of us knew and others had heard of, had gotten three quarters of a million dollars for his novel, which apparently included whimsical drawings. This was somehow not surprising, that news of ambition and focus and whimsy-related success in New York had come via the one New York media reporter playing herself inside a well-directed fake art opening in Berlin. It was the real toad in the imaginary garden.

The real news from the fake opening had seemed an ill omen. I’d been in Berlin for a year and had no better idea what I was doing there than I had when I arrived; the mere lifting of constraint had not infused my life with purpose, and I did not feel any freer than I had in San Francisco. I’d come to Berlin at least in part to escape what I saw as a kind of generational malaise, and had discovered there a slightly different kind of generational malaise. It had simply become a nonstop moral holiday, and we lived in it, and there was always someone in town from New York to show off for. This is an alternative to waiting in line for cupcakes, was the implication. Two friends visited and had a threesome with a tied-up Swede. Another friend came and cheated on her boyfriend with a twenty-one-year-old male model who was writing his undergraduate thesis on Heidegger. They came to see dawn and to cheat and we took them out and in the process allowed ourselves a great time we didn’t have to take full responsibility for. But as time went on we felt less and less great about it. We finished the night at seven in the morning, long after the sun had risen too early and too hot over the river at Bar25, at eight in the wintry morning coming out of Berghain long before the sun painted its gray on gray in the slushy sky, at ten in the morning at the Mauerpark flea market before you’ve been home to sleep, at eleven in the morning taking a regional train to a crummy Baltic beach to doze it off. The visitors were always ready to go home after an amazing week. It was their vacation but it was our life, and it no longer seemed like what I’d wanted. At that time there was a song lyric that did not stop running through my mind. “You spent the first five years trying to get with the plan / and the next five years trying to be with your friends again.” I wanted old friends and Micah and meaningful work and to sleep with a woman I was in love with and to wake up in the morning. I wanted the innocent life I’d had in San Francisco but this time having had the experiences I’d had in Berlin.

Even the spaces felt different to me. I no longer saw the aesthetic appeal of the postindustrial. We’d been pleased that the dilapidated buildings still stood, thought that the ruination—as opposed to Belle Époque elegance, or geometries of steel and glass—was a mark of our cold grit. But once things started to go bad, it seemed to me that we’d let the past persist merely to burlesque it. We sent up its quaint striving with athletic derangement. We kept the past around not for the sake of continuity but for the sake of rebuke. For a few months when I was out on my Middlemarch-avoiding walks I was drawn to the posters at bus stops asking for donations to shore up the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedächtniskirche. It had been built by the second kaiser in honor of the first one, and was mostly wrecked during the war. Since then it had been fastidiously maintained in its ruination, that it might stand as a warning. Every time it got too ruined, they had to beg the public for money to fix it up a little. It was a lot of effort to preserve an ideal state of decay. The effort involved seemed so pointless.

“I think I’m having a crisis,” I said to David as we walked to his after-party. I felt sheepish about casting him once more in the mentor role, especially on the night of his big success, but it was probably exactly that big success that made me feel I needed so much from him.

David fished a cigarette out of his pocket and lit it for me. “Of course you’re having a crisis. Look, everybody is having a crisis all of the time. You either feel like you’re too tied up and thus prevented from doing what you want to do, or you feel like you’re not tied up enough and have no idea what you want to do. The only thing that allows us any relief is what we tend to call purpose, or what I think about in terms of direction.”

You deal with the crisis that is life by obeying some authority you despise, the authority of money or the authority of relationships or grad school or the authority of cupcakes, and in that case you’re freaked out all the time because you feel like you’re always being thwarted, or you deal with it by renouncing all authority, and in that case you’re freaked out because you’re entirely thrown back upon yourself all of the time in a way pretty much nobody can handle. The main problem with desires, Berlin made clear, is that they’re not nearly as authoritative as we wish they were.

A sense of purpose allows for both the comfort of obedience and the dignity of autonomy. It represents relief from feeling servile and relief from having to worry at every moment about what, precisely, we think we might want right now, what costs we’re willing to pay. The question is: How can you find some structure that allows you to begin to understand what you want without forcing you to pay constant attention to the fluctuation of endlessly conflicting desires? And how can you realize that, whatever the situation, you’re probably already getting what you want on some level, whether you know it or not?

“Everybody is in a crisis all the time,” David finished, “and everybody, at the same time, under some sort of cover, is also pretty much doing what they want. Life is the crisis of doing what you want. Which means: Hold people accountable, but try to be understanding. Nobody gets off the hook just because they’re in a crisis, but you can have sympathy for them as they hang on it. The hook, I mean.” We reached the bar and he lit another cigarette.
Just before we entered the bar, he turned to me one last time.
“You are in a crisis, and you are also doing what you want.”

*

Eventually our crises began to resolve themselves, or maybe it was just that we’d grown bored of these particular crises and were ready for different ones. After one long week of inventive partying, Emilie called Kevolution from their apartment and asked when he would be home. It was ten to midnight on a Friday. “I’ll be home in twenty minutes,” Kevin said. He walked in at ten on Monday morning. Emilie threw her glass of orange juice at his head, narrowly missing an Alec Soth print worth ten thousand dollars, and asked where the fuck he’d been.

“Unterwegs,” he said. Under way.

Emilie broke up with him then, or maybe it was a little later, and Kevin was furious. He took back all he’d said before.  “Du bist nicht die Partymäuschen. Du bist ein Scheiß-Ami-Bitch.” It was cruel, but he knew he’d lost something good. She moved on to a guy with a job, a guy who could afford to go on actual vacations instead of trying to live in one.

Alix, for her part, was also moving on, going to graduate school in New York and some measure of stability and routine that, she feared, would drive her bonkers. She kept her place in Berlin, though, just in case. At the time I was happy for her and sad for myself. I’d thought I’d gotten used to the transience of the place, the constant new crashes and rescues that changed the demography of the shipwreck, but I hadn’t. At least not in her case.
Right around the time she was leaving they were closing the Building, some sort of artist-run space with wishy pedagogical ideas in the back basement of a supermarket wedged in between some East German tower blocks. For their final weekend of events, the people who ran the Building had invited their constituents to take an hour and do whatever they wished with it. Alix called her hour “The Event at the Building: Pedagogy as Potentiality in Reverse” and wrote a press release for it. It was to be listed as a lecture with a voguish description. The audience would file in and Alix would hand out boards and paper and charcoal and present a live model, and the people who expected a lecture on Rancière would have an hour of drawing from life.

Unfortunately for Alix, the Building’s press release, which Alix had long relied upon for its inanity, was in this case perversely clear: it went ahead and revealed the surprise. Alix tried to cancel the class, no longer saw a point, but her nude model was insistent. Alix wrote me a frustrated e-mail. “The model won’t not get naked. It’s part of her art practice, she says.” Until then nobody knew the nude art model had an art practice.

The nude model with the new art practice asked if I would document her nudity textually as part of a future project she was considering, on intimacy. Weren’t there going to be photographers there, I asked, not to mention a whole room of people drawing your nude figure? Yes, she said. But she wanted a text. Sort of like a live blog without the Internet.

I shouldn’t have been at all surprised, but by then I was so tired. Everything in the art world required extensive documentation. They didn’t believe in preparation, but they did believe in proof. I wondered then if the difference between people who believed in preparation and those who believed in proof, like the antagonism David described between those who believed in rehearsal and those who believed in spontaneity, wasn’t the difference between those who worked constantly for something that would endure and those who sought to capture something that occurred once. In Berlin photographs were taken of performances. Writers wrote about the photographs. Bloggers posted about the writers. Installation artists installed pieces about the bloggers.

Performance artists performed in the installations, hoping to get photographed. Photographers shot pictures of the bloggers, hoping to get in magazines. The Berlin Wall had existed primarily on television and in magazines. Berlin galleries existed primarily in Frieze and the social diary of Artforum.com.

Despite the confusion of the uncharacteristically lucid press release for the Event at the Building, most of the people were somehow surprised by the revelation that the fake lecture was going to be a real drawing class, which led one to believe that Alix was actually the only person reading these press releases in the first place. Everybody took it seriously. These were people who were very comfortable with their spectacular emancipation, but it had been years since they’d drawn from life, if they ever had. Everyone was quiet and absorbed and Alix shone like her crazy aunt Terry as she directed the changes in pose. She was immensely pleased.

At Bar Drei afterward we all felt clearer than we had in some time. David was inspired, and talked about his own version of a drawing class. He said he always thought about going back to actual theater directing, if he could do what he wanted. We ran out of cigarettes and walked out, past the Volksbühne, where he’d recently taken me to see Frank Castorf’s version of A Streetcar Named Desire. He called it Endstation Amerika—the Williams estate refused to let him use the name—and it lasted five hours. Kowalski was a grizzled Polish biker with roots in Solidarity. There was nudity and barbershop-quartet Britney Spears, and at one point Mitch forced Blanche to read off some stage directions from the supertitles. The actors may have been drunk. We’d both found it a shade too long.

“You know what the single most radical thing I could do in the Berlin theater would be?” David asked as he looked up at the stolid engaged columns of the Volksbühne. “I’d put on an old-fashioned naturalistic staging, in full period costume, of The Cherry Orchard.”

But pulling that off was going to take some time and a lot of preparation. The last show David put up while I still had an apartment in Berlin was called Hopefuls. It consisted of a few thousand headshots and cover letters seeking actor’s representation, which he plastered with hidden logic on his gallery’s walls. The point of all this was to represent the actor’s commitment to plasticity, to potential. One of the cover letters said that the actor had been told his range extended from Hayden Christensen to Halle Berry. This was because he was, he went on, “ethically dubious.” These were people campaigning vigorously for direction, and we needed to see them as gauche because we so acutely felt the same way. They were all doing the best they could to do something they cared about, and very few of them would succeed. We were doing as little as possible and pretended being in Berlin made us better than them. I stood in the room full of headshots and each one seemed to say, “I must change my life.”

We took out our frustrations on Berlin’s attempts to resemble New York. A lounge called Tausend opened up under the S-Bahn tracks near the Friedrichstraße station. Tausend means “thousand,” and it was not at all a Berlin name. A Berlin name would be “One” or “Two” or, at the very most, “Six.” Tausend also had a strict door policy, which was unusual. The night it opened David sent me a series of texts. “SHOCKINGLY NY 90S.” “I’M SITTING ON A GRAY FELT BANQUETTE.” “BLACK LEATHER CAR COATS OVER WHITE V-NECK T-SHIRTS, AND ONE PORK-PIE HAT.” “JAMIROQUAI.”

The whole point of Berlin was that there was nobody from college who worked in finance and asked if you rented or owned, nobody who blogged about media gossip, and no places like Tausend. Which meant that when a place like Tausend opened, it suggested that perhaps Berlin was over. But then Emilie would take us to the Damensalon, a former cosmetician’s in Neukölln with a bare interior, a plywood bar, and a vast sub-basement dance floor, and it was clear that nothing was over, that the very idea of a place being over, just like the very idea of a place being hip in the first place, was absurd. It had everything to do with the person saying it and nothing to do with the place itself.

What the word “over” really means is that your expectations of a place, your fantasies of who you might have become there, have been confounded by the persistence of you. You want a place to be strong enough to resist the patterns you force onto it, and there are places that can do that for a while. As it became increasingly clear that my era of inconsequence was not going to end in Berlin, as I’d anticipated, and as it had for Wenders’s angel, with the new taste of coffee—with, that is to say, the ability to feel as though what was in front of me was enough, the strength to sit alone in a room and not wonder what was going on in other, secret, more crowded rooms—I began to hope that it might end with Berlin. If moving to Berlin had not left me altered, alert and grateful and decisive, perhaps moving away would. Or perhaps just moving with direction would, waking up each day knowing I had committed myself to spending daylight walking as far as I could toward Santiago de Compostela. I didn’t actually care about what it meant to arrive there, or at least not the way a religious Catholic might. The word “pilgrim” comes from the Latin per agrum, “beyond the fields,” and for a long time in a lot of places it was pretty much the only pretext you had to leave home. I didn’t need a pretext to leave home, but I did want an excuse to have a series of structured days. I thought it might be a redemptive exercise in pointless direction, and I hoped in the end it might give me a better sense for where I stood.",Gideon Lewis-Kraus,2004,"[94, 84, 80, 68, 71]",5

When she runnin', you never see a ho come in last
She's so fast she's got a 454 in her ass
You never gonna win that race
Put on a seatbelt and don't let her sit on your face
She might kill you in the morning at 2:14
Doin' the pussy pop like she from New Orleans
Its been a while more than 10 years past
When you close your eyes you can still see her ass
Her momma used to dance like that
Bouncin' that ass with her hands on her back
I saw her grandmomma do it with a baby in her arms
Put her hand on a car and started swingin' it hard
Every nigga at the party wanna get with the bitch
Look like she was fucking an invisible dick

You don't have to be naked to dance like a stripper
Just wiggle that tail like your name is flipper
Do it like a dolphin on top of the water
Take it down to the ground and pop it harder
You been hangin' around them pimps again
Got ya gangsta walkin' like in Memphis, Tenn
Get it girl, I like the way you bounce
She must have learned that deep down way in the south
You from the west coast where you learned to do that dance
I'm about to stick my dick through the back of your pants
I wouldn't pass up a chance to grip your cheeks
Fall in that ass and keep me for a week
Now all that booty, is that for me
Its lookin' so fat, we at the party
Lets hit the bar and drink, Tequilla shots
Find a spot on the floor, lemme see it drop

Bounce that ass up and down to the floor
Shake that shit till you can't no more

Now we one song away from tearing the club up

Do it now cause tomorrow ain't promised today

And don't worry about me stepping all over your feet

335,Fallen,"[Hook]
Yeah
Take me to the truth
Take me home with you
Change my taste in music (I'm fallen)
Make me rise with you (She likes you)
I'm surprised you do

[Verse 1]
Look, your love's like a river, bae, I've seen better days, yeah
In my soul, you penetrate, I need your energy
Your vibrations make me levitate, sipping Hennessy
Reading bell hooks, she just sayin'

[Hook]
I'm surprised you do (Baby)
I won't lie to you (I love you)
I'm your guy who's new
Hide me from the blue
I'm dying on the moon, and I just needed you

[Verse 2]
Baby, you are so unusual like cutting cuticles
But that is just what makes you beautiful like watching tulips grow
When you walk, it's just slow motion baby, why you moving slow?
And when you talk, I got my lasers on you like a UFO
Girl your eyes are like the open sea, the simple poetry
This whole generation, OMG, I see your soul, it's older
We should build a city overseas, this country kinda cold
I mean they feed the children dopamine
And leave them on the sofa
I mean, ah, I need someone to renounce with, whoa
Ice bucket challenge in the fountain, whoa
Chance of finding you, one in a 100 thousand, whoa
I just wanna kiss you on the mountain, whoa

[Hook]
Spend some time with you
I might bend the rules
'Cause I'm in love with you
You can't see the truth
I will show you soon
Just meet me on the moon

[Verse 3]
She said, ""Love is a strong word"", said love is a strong word?
Well I'ma sing it for you baby, I'll be your song bird
If we don't have no loving, how we supposed to move onward?
Heard a brother just got shot because he stopped on the wrong curb
If love is a strong word, then love is a strong word
Then we'll need lots of loving if we wanna move onward
And I'ma sing it to you, baby, I'll be your song bird
But I'ma keep it honest with you

[Hook]
I won't lie to you
My pride dies with you
Girl, I love you too
You want me, you got me
You want me, you got me
I will see you soon
You want me, you got me
You want me, you got me

Loving and fighting
Accusing, denying
I can't imagine a world with you gone
The joy and the chaos, the demons we're made of
I'd be so lost if you left me alone
You locked yourself in the bathroom
Lying on the floor when I break through
I pull you in to feel your heartbeat
Can you hear me screaming, ""Please don't leave me!""

Come back, I still need you
Let me take your hand, I'll make it right
I swear to love you all my life
Hold on, I still need you

Long endless highway, you're silent beside me
Driving a nightmare I can't escape from
Helplessly praying, the light isn't fading
Hiding the shock and the chill in my bones
They took you away on a table
I pace back and forth as you lay still
They pull you in to feel your heartbeat
Can you hear me screaming, ""Please don't leave me!""

No one can stop you, you know that I’m talking to you

Tiny heart, tiny beat

349,Runnin (Dying To Live),"[Intro: Rob May & 2Pac]
Between you and Biggie it was like, who's going to rule the
Nigga kingdom and shit, basically, know what I'm saying?
I was like, this is like a fucking election
It is that
You know what I am saying
Me and Biggie's situation is smaller than that, it's like…

[Hook]
And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
(You don't know)
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Check it, I grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up
Choppin' rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls tryna turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missin'
Show they toes, you know they got stepped on
A fistful of bullets, a chest full of Teflon
Runnin' from the police, picture that
Nigga, I'm too fat, I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back, it don't faze me
When he drop, take his Glock and I'm Swayze
Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight
Lay back, I got some money to make, motherfucker

[Hook]
And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?
(It's on me)

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
But still I'm havin' memories of high speed when the cops crashed
As I laugh, pushin' the gas while my Glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb, but we had heart
In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts?
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies, now the whole world's tryna screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?
But stay true, sippin' 22's of brew
And now media is tryna test me
Got the press askin' questions, tryna stress me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested, and flipped
He screamed ""Thug Life!"" and emptied the clip
Got tired of runnin' from the police

[Hook]
And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

[Outro: 2Pac]
They wanted a new regime. And my regime includes East coast, includes West coast

[The Notorious B.I.G.]
I was more shocked than anything
You know what I'm sayin'?
But I wasn't more shocked of him dying
I was more shocked of him… Pac is a strong dude, yo
I know dude, you know what I'm sayin'? Real strong
So when they was like he got shot, I was just more like, ""Again?"" you know what I'm sayin'?
He always getting shot, or shot at
He going to pull through this one again
Make a few records about it, and it's going to be over
You know what I'm sayin'?
But when he, when he died, I was just like, ""whoa"", you know what I'm saying? Kinda took me by
I mean, even though we was going through our drama
I would never wish death on nobody
You know what I'm sayin'?
Because there ain't no coming back from that",2Pac,2004,"[82, 78, 52, 53, 44, 28, 26, 20, 20]",9
350,Some Girls (Dance With Women),"The door is coming off the hinges
About to pass out
No doubt it's hot in here
Because the club is full of women
It's wall to wall and I got my crew with me

We grab a table spot to chill in
Hunt down a waitress, make an order
Here we go
Throw back a drink and let it kick in
It takes a minute, whose ready to have some fun

Get up and take a lap to mingle
Love being single on a night like this, yeah
So many beautiful young people
The game is legal
You dont have to kill 'em though
Just look at everyone as equal

While you were dancing she was watching
Feelin' you
Her and her girlfriends by the speaker
Are moving on each other
This is when the show begins

Baby girl you keep looking at me
Move your body so sexy
Nice and slow, watch you roll
You know how I like it

Baby girl 'cause you know you got me
Move your body so sexy
Nice and slow, watch you roll
You know how I like it

CHORUS:
Some girls dance with women
Knowing that it gets them attention
I want to get in with them
So pass me a drink and let's roll

Some girls dance with women
Knowing that it gets them attention
I want to get in with them
So pass me a drink and let's go

Might have to peel me off the ceiling
I'm like a soda that's been shaken up, boom
I find your playfulness appealing
The cat and mouse race
On your mark, get ready, go

Send you a drink, see what the deal is
Held up your glass and blew a kiss
Then took a sip
When you were finished, back to business
You and your girlfriends move up
This is how you draw them in

Baby girl you keep looking at me
Move your body so sexy
Nice and slow, watch you roll
You know how I like it

Baby girl 'cause you know you got me
Move your body so sexy
Nice and slow, watch you roll
You know how I like it

(Instrumental Break)

Step right up and spin the wheel
All charged up on what you feel
Make an approach tryin' to keep it real

Making a pose trying to keep it real
I want to take you home

I'll teach you how to stunt

My TV's pop up in a Maybach Benz
I'll teach you how to stunt
Nigga you can't see me

I'll teach you how to stunt
My neck stay blinging, my rims stay gleaming, I'm shining man
I'll teach you how to stunt
I see you scheming, nigga keep on dreaming, I hurt ya man
I'll teach you how to stunt

Seven series BM, six series Benz
Twenty-four inches, Giovanni rims
R1 one wheel when I'm on one of them
Ma, that boy out there acting a fool that's him
They say I've changed man, I'm getting paper, I'm flashy
They like me better when I'm fucked up and ashy
My royalty check's the rebirth of Liberace
Stunt so hard, everybody got to watch me
And I don't really care if it's platinum or white gold
As long as the VS bling, look at that light show
In the hood they say 50 man your sneaker look right yo
Just can't believe Reebok did a deal with a psycho
Banks is a sure thing, y'all niggas might blow
I'm fin to drop that, so I suggest you lay low
Buck, he from Cashville, Ten-a-key nigga
We getting them ten a ki', save ten for me nigga

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
I'm sensing a lot of tension now that I'm rapping
But the kids used to look up to you, what happened?
Me on the contrary, hand covered with platinum
Different color coupes but I'm in love with the black one
On point, cause you get R.I.P.'s when slacking
So the stash box big enough to squeeze the MAC in
Yeah, I'm fairly new but I demand some respect
Cause I already wear your advance on my neck
I'm fresh off the jet, then I breeze to the beaches
Blue Yankee fitted, G-Unit sneakers
I already figured out what to do with all my features
Decorate the basement, full of street sweepers
When it comes to stunting there's nothing you can teach us
We're in a different time zone, your records don't reach us
Naww, I ain't here to save the world, just roll up a blunt
Come with me out front, I'LL TEACH YOU HOW TO STUNT

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I'll teach you how to stunt

[Verse 3: Young Buck]
Chain so icy, you don't have to like me
In a throwback jersey, with the throwback Nikes
I know you probably seen me with Cash Money from back in the days
The only thing changed is the numbers on the Range
I bought me an old school and blew out the brains
The Roc the Mic tour, I threw off my chain
My Sprewell's spinning man, I'm doing my thing
And whodi now in trouble now that you in the game
Come on now, we all know gold is getting old
The ice in my teeth keep the Cristal cold
G-Unit homie, acting like y'all don't know
Look, I can't even walk through the mall no more
I just pull up, get out, and get all the hoes
They never seen doors lift up on a car before
Don't be mad at me dog, that's all I know
That's how to show these fugazies how it's supposed to go, yeah

Let's get at it dog, whoo!

[Verse 1: Murphy Lee]
Now what goes up, must come down (shiiett)
But we ain't coming down, it be them same ol' clowns
Aiming your pound, pretending they proud
But when you leave town they go around they running they mouth (maaann)
They something like a hater, man
Talking bad about a playa as if I'm not gon' see ya later, man
You constantly frontin' until you confronted on
If you don't like whats going on goin' to another song
'Cause I keep a hater guilty
My cars and my money all alike man, both them filthy (get it?)
From skimpy and empty to fuel on full
See I be high when my 'Ca-go Bulls
Obey no rules to school you fools
Schoolboy's err'y where, we're Young Dude news (maann)
St. Louis like Blues, D. Miles and Larry Hughes
And the Young Dude done paid young dudes' dues dude

[Hook] 2x
[JD:] But yo, what da hook gon' be? (Uh oh!)

The sun'll come out... tomorrow
And I will never have to borrow
Got my first car when I turned sixteen
Only drove it home outta town limousines
Plus we was broke wit a deal but nobody could tell
So we did what we had to do for ""Country Grammar"" to sell
Haha, I stay on my own melodies
Plus I like my booties and my boobs like a capital letter 'B'
That's how it is, how it better be
I preferably rather have two or three girls in the bed wit' me
Close your ears, ma, you ain't heard nothing (what?)
I always pay ma, let a brother hold something
I'm basically coming from nothing to something
When I say nothing meaning pocket full of lint and buttons
(We all we got!) Used to be creative on Halloween (how you gon?)
Stop a hotter teen went from nada to a lot of things

People always saying man it must be nice
No hi, no nothing, not a simple ""how's life?""
Understand the money's good but I'm still from the hood
So don't be asking for no ""inch"" and be expecting the ""foot""
Unless you want a foot (whoo!)
I know a few crooks that can place you where you need to be put
And it might not cost me playa
Got a Benz pepper interior, paint salty playa
And we all push it, but me I push it real good
Brains blown out, chromed out, wheel real wood
Catch me on your local derrty
Or in the studio doing vocals derrty
I'm the same dude that came through wit my crew
Let the girls do me while you do you
And um, all I need is JD beat to be banging
And I'll come up wit these verses that I'm usually slanging
I be ripping man

That type of chick that says ""hey girl, let's go to the after party""
After that we go to my room for the after, after party

And she fuck with nothin but gangstas that is old O.G.'s (O.G.)

At a gangsta party, she'll be drinkin Bacardi

But that Benz so fast, it'll jerk your body
And we smokin that Cali dro, totin that calico

No one will never know, what happen behind the door
I like it fast or slow, a freaky bitch fo sho
Street life is all I know, hustlin and stackin dough
I file to keep it gangsta, until my casket closed

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Mannie Fresh]
Once upon a time in this place called hood
Where the gangsta girls shake it and they all smell good
Lived this legendary pimp (pimp) by the name of Fresh
Fix hair, fix nails, fix toes, fix breast
But one chick super sick, make every nigga grab his dick
Heart pound up and down, when she goin round and round
Do the +Snake+, stop and shake, ass like an earthquake
I can't wait to meet her uh, undress her, beat her up
Now we leavin from the club, and she let me cop a rub
Can't believe she choose me, +Feelin On Her Booty+
I'm about to cut like knives, strokin mami with some ice
Takin me to paradise, I nut once, she nut twice
Sex in cities, rubbin titties, that's how I get it
One more 'gain, with her friend, playa that's how I hit it
Now we grippin, grabbin, pullin, stabbin (what is your name?)
It's Hypnotiq how I got it, but I'ma glad that you came

[Chorus]

[Verse 4 - Mannie Fresh]
Slim Teresa, and Lakeisha (they some gangsta girls)
Tanya, Wanda, and Laneisha (they some gangsta girls)
My fifty Kims all in Tims (gangsta girls)
A hundred shorties, all at parties (gangsta girls)
Full of drama, baby mama (she's a gangsta girl)
When they freakin on the weekend (they some gangsta girls)
But they knowin where they goin (the gangsta girls)
Fly wheels, pay they bills (the gangsta girls)

A different motive in your eyes
And now I'm out, see you later

Hey, this is radio station WSKEE
We're taking calls on the wish line
Making your wacky wishes come true
Hello?

[Hook]
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala

[Verse 1]
I wish I was like six-foot-nine so I can get with Leoshi
'Cause she don't know me but, yo, she's really fine
You know I see her all the time, everywhere I go
And even in my dreams, I can scheme of ways to make her mine
'Cause I know she's livin' phat
Her boyfriend's tall and he plays ball, so how am I gonna compete with that?
'Cause when it comes to playing basketball
I'm always last to be picked and in some cases never picked at all
So I just lean up on the wall
Or sit up in the bleachers with the rest of the girls who came to watch their man ball
Dag y'all! I never understood, black
Why the jocks get the fly girls, and me, I get the hood rats
I tell 'em, ""Scat, skittle, scabobble""
Got hit with a bottle and put in a hospital for talkin' that mess
I confess, it's a shame
When you livin' in a city that's the size of a box and nobody knows yo' name
Glad I came, to my senses
Like quick-quick, got sick-sick to my stomach, overcometh by thoughts
Of me and her together, right?
So when I asked her out, she said I wasn't her type

[Hook]
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala

[Verse 2]
I wish I had a brand new car so far, I got this hatchback
And everywhere I go, yo, I gets laughed at
And when I'm in my car I'm laid back
I got an 8-track, and a spare tire in the backseat, but that's flat
And do you really wanna know what's really wack?
See, I can't even get a date, so what do you think of that?
I heard that prom night is a bomb night
With a hood rat t'you can hold tight
But really though, I'm Figaro
When in my car, I can't even get a hello
Well, so many people wanna cruise Crenshaw on Sunday
One day I'mma have to get in my car and go
You know I take the 110 until the 105
Get off at Crenshaw, tell my homies, ""Look alive""
'Cause it's hard to survive
When you're living in a concrete jungle and these girls keep passing me by
She looks fly, she looks fly
Make me say, ""my, my, my""

[Hook]
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat

I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat

I wish I was a little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I was a little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I was a little bit taller, y'all
I wish I was a baller
I wish I was a little bit taller
I wish I was a baller

[Verse 3]
Hey, I wish I had my way
'Cause every day would be a Friday, and you could even speed on the highway
I would play ghetto games
Name my kids ghetto names: Little Mookie, Big Al, Lorraine
Yo, you know that's on the real
So if you're down on your luck then you should know just how I feel
'Cause if you don't want me around
See, I go simple, I go easy, I go Greyhound
Hey, you, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down
Ah, yes, ain't that fresh?
Everybody wants to get down like that

[Chorus]
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat

I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat

360,My Baby,"[Hook]
I don't care about an argument I'll still be here tomorrow
For you
I gotta room up in the city we can play finish the bottle
I'll pour you up, we'll work on us
Cause ain't nobody taking my baby
I wanna be clear, I'm stayin' right here
Cause ain't nobody takin' my baby

[Verse 1]
Your heart weighs a ton
Girl watch me heavy lift
How many more times we gon' argue over petty shit
I mess up but shit you mess up too
The way you answer makes me question you
I guess your body ain't the only thing that's flexible
You bend the truth, we lettin' loose, verbal warfare
Open wounds we still poke even tho we know it's sore there
Cause hurt people hurt people, that's a known fact
You got me tempted to say fuck it where my hoes at
But I know that they don't last, that's why I don't go back
I stay put I want you, I don't care I want you

[Hook]
I don't care about an argument I'll still be here tomorrow

I wanna be clear, I'm stayin' right here
Cause ain't nobody takin' my baby

[Verse 2]
It was me and you in love for a quick summer
Now we textin' question marks cause we switched numbers
Lookin' back you were the perfect fit
Didn't let me fuck right away you made me work for it
Use to ride around drunk you brought out the worst in me
Damn I went to jail with you and that was a first for me
Heaven knows that I was hell bent
First time we said we love each other was through cell vents
Guess I should've known then
But I'm stubborn I'll admit that
At least I got some classic rap songs from your mishaps
Shit I ain't perfect though, I stayed what's wrong with me
I'm in love with challenges, girl that's just honesty
No matter what tho I stayed put
Till it wasn't funny anymore like Dane cook
Out of sync out of touch, I should probably give it up but
I'm a lover not a fighter but I'll fight for what I love

I don't care about an argument I'll still be here tomorrow

361,Love You More,"[Intro]
Still love me? Take this
You ready? One, two, three!

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more

[Verse 1]
It's sick but who could ever predict, we'd be doin' the same shit
We say we do it for our baby but we don't
We do it for us, it's lust 'cause neither one
Of us trust each other, so we fuck 'til we bust
And we cuss each other out, we know what it's about, shout
'Til I throw you out the house, you throw me out the house
I throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth
Fist fight 'til we turn this mother out
Then apologize after, laughter, pain
It's insane, we're back in the same chapter again
And it's sad but it's true, when I'm layin' here with you
There ain't nothin' anyone could ever say or ever do 'cause

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more

[Verse 2]
'Cause I hate you, do you hate me?
Good, 'cause you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry
It makes me wanna just take you and just throw you
On the bed and fuck you like I don't even know you
You fuck other people and I fuck other people
You're a slut, but I'm equal, I'm a mutt, we're both evil
In our ways but neither one of us would ever admit it
'Cause one us would have one up on the other so forget it
We can make accusations, people spread rumors
But they ain't got proof, 'til they do it's just the two of us
It's you and me, 'cause any chick can say that she screwin' me
But you gotta believe me to a degree 'cause true indeed
If you didn't, I wouldn't be hittin' — yeah, I would
'Cause the sex is too damn good, if I ran who would I run to
That would be this soft and warm?
So it's off and on, usually more off than on
But at least we know that we share this common bond
You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on
I hope, the only reason that I cope is 'cause of that fact
And plus I can bust in that and that's why

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more

[Verse 3]
I can never understand it, that's why I don't try
From junior high until we both die, it's silly
Oh, why must we try? Is it really so rough
That we must always call each other's Billy Goat's Gruff?
Try to pull each other's legs, until the other begs
We're lyin' to ourselves, that's the beauty of it, yeah!
'Cause we truly love each other, that's why we always fightin'
All we do is shove each other every other fuckin' night
And it's clear it ain't gonna change, it's pent-up rage
We both had, we both feel like we've been upstaged
By someone else, we've both been someone else's
""Someone else,"" problem is neither one wants help
It's an addiction and it can't be fixed
Our family's mixed up, there's a baby sister in the mix
And it hurts 'cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit
And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit
And they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time
On every song, every lyric and every rhyme
All the hoopla, all of the whoopty-woo
What you put me through, fuckin' whoopty-do
But I won't be made a fool of if this is true love
You wouldn't do what you did last time, you wouldn't screw up
This time, 'cause this time, girl, I'm tellin' you what
You do it again, I'm fuckin' you up

[Bridge]
No matter what you say, or what you do
I'ma hunt you down 'til I find you
No matter where you run, I'll be right there
Right behind you, in your nightmares
So I brought you the flowers and the candy
All the times that you threw it back at me
Told me you hate me, you gon' hate me more
When you find out, you can't escape me, whore

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on

I told em: ""follow me"". they knew I had it cracking B
One said ""ain't you that boy that be on BET?""
""Ya that's me, Ching-a-ling equipped with much ding-a-ling""
Knock on the door, I'm on the scene of things
Busted in, Henny bottle to the face
Fuck it then, feel like my head is toxic waste
It's some pretty girls in hurr, I heard em whispering

Niggas knocking on the door drunk, acting silly
The girl said ""can I be in yo video"" I'm like ""yeah!"", ""oh really?""
Now she naked strip teasing, me I'm just cheesing
She gave me a reason to be a damn heathen

I swing it like a bat, but these balls are not Wiffle
Hit 'em in triples, with no strikes, stripes, or whistles
I ain't felt this good, since my wood lived off a thistle
Sippin' some ripple, I got quarters, dimes, and nickels
For shizzle dizzle, I'm on a track with the Big Snoop Dizzle

Light 'em up, light 'em up
Tell me where you are, tell me where you are
The summer nights, the bright lights
And the shooting stars, they break my heart

[Pre-Chorus 1: Jamie Scott]
I'm calling you now, but you're not picking up
Your shadows so close if you are still in love
Then light a match, light a match
Baby, in the dark, show me where you are

[Chorus: Jamie Scott]
Oh, love
How I miss you every single day when I see you on those streets
Oh, love
Tell me there's a river I can swim that will bring you back to me
'Cause I don't know how to love someone else
I don't know how to forget your face
Oh, love
God, I miss you every single day and now you're so far away

[Post-Chorus: Jamie Scott]
So far away

[Verse 2: Romy Dya]
It's breaking me, I'm losing you
We were far from perfect, but we were worth it
Too many fights, and we cried, but never said we're sorry
Stop saying you love me

[Pre-Chorus 2: Romy Dya]
You're calling me now, but I can't pick up
Your shadow's too close, and I'm still in love
The summer's over now, but somehow, it still breaks my heart
We could have had the stars, oh

[Chorus: Jamie Scott & Romy Dya / Jamie Scott]
Oh, love
How I miss you every single day when I see you on those streets
Oh, love
Tell me there's a river I can swim that will bring you back to me

I don't know how to forget your face
Oh, love
God, I miss you every single day and now you're so far away

365,Honesty (Write Me A List),"[Verse 1]
He said: ""Just think it over, and write me a list
""So we can figure out what we both deserve.""
She hardly could believe it, that their love had come to this:
Dividing an' deciding his and hers
But she grabbed a paper napkin, an' asked the waitress for a pen
An' one by one, she wrote down what she wanted most from him

[Chorus]
""Honesty, sincerity, tenderness and trust
""A little less time for the rest of the world
""And more for the two of us
""Kisses each mornin', 'I love you's' at night
""Just like it used to be
""The way life was when you were in love with me.""

[Verse 2]
She reached across the table an' placed it in his hand
An' said: ""You know this isn't easy for me.""
As he thought about the new car, the house an' the land
An' wondered what that bottom line would be
An' a thousand other things that she'd want him to leave behind
But he never dreamed he'd open up that napkin and find:

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Well, he fought back the tears, as he looked in her eyes
An' said: ""I don't know where to start.""
An' she said: ""Everything on that list in your hand
""Is hidden somewhere in your heart

""The way life was when you were in love with me.""",Rodney Atkins,2004,"[85, 66, 57, 61, 65, 59]",6
366,Badaboom,"Big Bada boom, Luda’s in this bitch
Pussy niggas clear the room
I came through the door, I said it before
I’m the truth in this booth and you niggas all hoes
Counterfeit rappers say I’m stealing their flows
But I can’t steal what you never made up bitch
Y’all some duplicate rap cloning niggas
I manufacture you hoes -- put on your makeup, bitch
Let me explain, nothing’s been new since Big Daddy Kane
Flows will get recycled passed around to different names
But what’s the same, that every verse I spit is insane
Got more styles than any rapper in the game, 11 years and still counting
And y'all get a couple hit records, make some noise and have the nerve to start shouting
Who’s gassing ‘em, they blowing smoke up your ass, you fired up but I’m just puff puff passing ‘em
Until they roaches, buried in my ashtray
Nigga burn slow, better pray like it’s your last day
You lying to yourself, just admit it
May not like the way I use it but you know you ain't invent it boy
Do your research before you make a claim so bogus
That's disrespecting pioneers in the game
Fuck the fame but go ahead and get ya 5 minutes
Then you front line cadets can report to your lieutenants
See I’m ya past, I’m ya future and ya present
So watch ya fucking mouth when you speak about a legend
16 times platinum, 6 number 1 peaks
So I can give a fuck what you sold in ya first week
You’s weak, softer than the Pillsbury dough boy
Don’t make me expose the truth, you’s a ho, boy
Don’t make me get on that ""Stomp"" shit and get back at it
You rappers ain't even in my fucking tax bracket
Why am I wasting my time
Yeah I admit I get a little ludicrous with my rhymes, sometimes
But my fans know the difference because “My Chick Bad” went platinum
Still winning, motherfucker

The nerve of you niggas man
You ain't got enough medals on your jacket to address me boy
Fall back in formation, y’all outta line
I was told not to kill a mosquito with a cannon
So the next time you gnats got a real problem
Don’t be a coward like a nigga that used to be signed to me going on twitter rants and shit

Head out on steel horses
With wheels and we ride

We burn up that road to old Mexico
Blend in with the desert
Just we amigos
And we roll

There'll be no regrets, no worries and such
For cowboys like us

We talk about living, babies, and women
All that we've lost and all we've been giving
We sing about true love, lie about things we ain't done
Drink one more cold one, come morning get up

I made him laugh out loud when I told him

Thought I was Earnhardt
Drivin' fast but I didn't see the ditch
Took out a mailbox, then a fence and then a barn
The police came and called my father
But I met the farmer's daughter
And when the judge asked me why I did it
He threw the book at me when I told him
Cause the chicks dig it

Just throw caution to the wind, my friend
Then sit back and watch your life begin, cause

Check the shit

[Havoc]
Nine-six, Escobar 600

[Verse 1: Nas (Havoc)]
Check the shit
My mind's set, son got wet, I'm vexed really
They snatched off his Rolex, smacked his bitch silly
Why niggas actin' illy? Word to Will, he 'bout to feel it
I feel it, he shoulda been dealt with it
Them niggas sour, they put to much flour in their coke
And got the nerve to wonder WHY THEY'RE BROKE
While we was gleamin', niggas was schemin'
Seen the ill Beamers beamin'
Triple-beam and doublin' cream had 'em fiendin'
To get they fingers on the dosa, I called Sosa
""Sosa, these niggas hit the God, bring the toaster
Meet me in the Bridge, I'm bout to go loca""
Left my rat beggin' me to stay and stroke her
He came through with two fly bitches, Venus and Vicious
With two MACs inside the Volvo, what up God, I'm still sober
I need some Henn to bend me over, my nigga Hav gotta soldier
It's gettin' down, it's goin' down kid (I got this, I got this)
I heard he might not live, I'm holdin' back tears
Told these broads to put it in gear
With two females that don't smile, diggin' they style, yo
What up son? These niggas done started somethin' wild
You know the clique well, Rhamel with the gold in his grill
Tried to get a name, holding the steel
I paid attention to the females
Maintained bitches when it get real
Sos' pulled me close and told me the deal
He said both hoes'll peel
Spray shots and reload and still handle the wheel
Point 'em out, smoke a Phil' then chill
I laid back, Escobar status
Knowin' The Firm got it cornered, we on it, shit we was born with

[Chorus: Havoc]
Spark the lye, Q.B.C. yo it's do or die
In this, business of trifeness

Lift you up, bless you with a shorty then we set you up
Spark the lye, Q.B.C. yo it's do or die

[Verse 2: Nas]
Hold it right there, pull over
That nigga right there inside the Rover
I knew he'd be right here, I told you
Let's get him now, look at him smile, ice Bulova
Polo pullover, big links and rockin' boulders
He's stuntin', after he left my man like that
Without a fair chance to fight back, but I'll be right back
He never seen us, Sos' gave the MAC to Venus
And Vicious, lookin' delicious, handle yo' business
And step to him, shake your ass, try to screw him
Do what ya gotta do to get to him
A tight Parasuco with young faces
Can turn niggas Buttafuoco, of all ages
They was amused by the way they walked, way they talked
Only if they knew these girls had sprayed New York
If they had to, heard him ask Venus, ""Could I have you?""
He jumped out a Jeep, heard her tell him ""Don't grab, boo""
They started chattin', was only bout a minute, flat when
They jumped in the back of the Jeep laughin'
We followed them pollyin', he thought the hoes were Somalian
Probably when they hit the Holiday Inn
I grabbed the phone and called the Mobb and them
We laid low about a hour or so, these bitches movin' too slow
We both holdin', what if them wild hoes started foldin'?
Sosa said ""Say no more"", we started rollin'
Before we got in they must have shot him, security wildin'
There the girls go, hurry up we out
In the 940, me, Sosa and two shorties
The punk niggas got murdered in the orgy

Spark the lye, Q.B.C. yo it's do or die

Every one is
Every one is
Every one is
Oh fuck

You can't imagine so many monkeys in the daily mail
And all of them coming anonymously, so they leave no trail
Never thought I'd have an admirer from overseas
But somebody's sending me stationary filled with chimpanzees

Some chimps in swimsuits
Some chimps are swinging from a vine
Some chimps in jackboots
Some chimps that wish they could be mine
Starsky and Hutch chimps
A chimp who's sitting on the can
A pair of Dutch chimps
Who send their love from Amsterdam

Another postcard with chimpanzees
And every one is addressed to me
Another postcard with chimpanzees
And every one is addressed to me

If I had to guess, I'd say the monkey-sender thinks its great
He's sending me, maybe she's sending me, just to see me get irate
I'm losing sleep and it's gonna be keeping me up all night
I thought it was funny but now I got money on a monkey-fight

Some chimps in hard-hats
Chimps a-working on a chain gang
Some chimps who love cats
Burning rubber in a Mustang
A birthday wishing chimp
A chimp in black, like a goth
A going fishing chimp
A British chimp in the bath

Another postcard with chimpanzees
And every one is addressed to me
Another postcard with chimpanzees
And every one is addressed to me

Somebody followed me even though I packed and moved my home
No matter what they come and they come, they won't leave me alone
Another monkey in the mail could make me lose my mind
But look at me shuffling through the stack until I finally find
Some chimps in swimsuits
Some chimps in jackboots
Some chimps in hard-hats
Some chimps who love cats
I got some shaved chimps
Thats chimps devoid of any hair
I got depraved chimps
Dressed up in a-womens underwear

[Verse 1]
Misdemeanor on the flow, pretty boy, here I come
Pumps and a bump make you wanna hurt something

Number one; drums go bump, bump, bump
This beat here will make your pum pum jump
If you's a fat one, put your clothes back on
Before you start putting pot holes in my lawn
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh
I'm under attack like my name was Saddam
I am the bomb from New York to Milan
And I can write a song sicker than Jeffrey Dahm'
(Woop woop!) Don't touch my car alarm
Break in my car, you will hear ""Viper Armed""

Spank that, yank that, dutch back now
Freak him, freak her, whatever your choice
Didn't come to judge, I came to get ya moist
Scream ""Who-di-whooooooo!"", now my voice is lost
Can I get a ride on the white horse?

Bad Boys 2, the soundtrack
Let's go

[Verse 1: Nelly]
Hey girl, what your name is?
Where you from? Turn around; who you came with?
Is that your ass or your mama half reindeer?
I can't explain it but damn sure glad you came here
I'm still a sucker for cornrows, you know I never changed that
Your body is banging mama, but where your brains at?
I'm still the same cat when I was younger running with bad boys
But now I'm on the hook and so I'm running with Bad Boy
Here come another man, unlike no other man
Candy coated (what!) switching every other lane
Y'all help me, why don't cha please help me
Eighth girl this week and it's only Tuesday
I like the cocky bowlegged ones
Black, white and Dominicans
Hispanics and Asians, please shake it for Nelly San
Manolos, Ma-no-no's, I can't tell
Everybody ain't that rich, just when you do it, do it well

[Hook: Nelly + (P.D.)]
Let me see you take it low
(Girl, go and take it low)
We can even do it slow

You know I love that (I love that)

Baby, you impressive, let's get
To know each other
You the best of the best and
You got to love it in the dresses, the sexiest
I had to tell her she's a young Janet Jackson live in living color
Look here mama you're dead wrong for having them pants on
Capri's cut low so when you shake it I see your thong
My pocket's full of dough, shake your feathers till the morning
It's Bad Boy and Nelly, man, somebody better warn them

[Bridge: Nelly]
Oh no, I heard them bad boys coming
Can't stop now
Got to continue my running (Yeah)
'Cause we gon' party 'til the lights come on
And if my song stop, fuck it 'cause my mic's still on

[Verse 3: Murphy Lee + (Nelly)]
Yo, I'm the big booty type
I like 'em thick with their mind right (Awe)
Banging personality, conversate when the time right (Naw)
I'm not hard, I've got women to handle that
They be like, ""He the man,"" when I'm really a Thundercat
Come on, you know the 'Tics connect like Voltron
Collect so much grass, popo thinking we mow lawns
My Cole Haans don't match that
But it matches her headwrap and the seats that I got in the 'Lac
I'm just a Juvenile, 'cause I Be about G's
Keep the women Weezy, many say they have my babies
I'm Young like Turk, I like that Cash and that Money
(I'mma eat my money) Man, I'm that damn hungry
You see I'm starvin' like Marvin, girl
I've got sixteen bars of fire is what I'm starting
Plus my rats come in packs like Sammy and Dean Martin
And I got so many keys, you think I'm valet parking (Get it?)

379,Harder To Breathe,"[Verse 1]
How dare you say that my behavior's unacceptable
So condescending, unnecessarily critical
Have the tendency of getting very physical
So watch your step cause if I do, you'll need a miracle
Drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here
The double vision I was seeing is finally clear
You want to stay but you know very well I want you gone
[Gibberish]

[Chorus]
When it gets cold outside and you've got nobody to love
Understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
Like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

[Verse 2]
What you're doing is screwing things up inside my head
You should know better, never listened to a word I said
Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat
Hoping someday somebody will do you like I did

[Chorus]
When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

I think that I've got irritable bowel syndrome
Ugh, I gotta pee!

[Bridge]
Does it kill, does it burn
Is it painful to learn
It's me that has the control

Does it thrill, does it sting
When you feel what I bring
And you wish that you had me to hold

[Chorus]
When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
There's no way we're gonna give up
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams, that's me!
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there cause it's getting harder and harder to believe we're doing this fucking song",GWAR,2004,"[50, 49, 48]",3
380,I Love This Bar,"[Verse 1]
We got winners, we got losers
Chain smokers and boozers
And we got yuppies, we got bikers
We got thirsty hitchhikers
And the girls next door dress up like movie stars

Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar

[Verse 2]
We got cowboys, we got truckers
Broken-hearted fools and suckers
And we got hustlers, we got fighters
Early birds and all-nighters
And the veterans talk about their battle scars

Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar

[Hook]
I love this bar
It's my kind of place
Just walkin' through the front door
Puts a big smile on my face
It ain't too far, come as you are
Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar

[Verse 3]
I've seen short skirts, we got high-techs
Blue-collar boys and rednecks
And we got lovers, lots of lookers
And I've even seen dancing girls and hookers
And we like to drink our beer from a mason jar

Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar
Yes I do

[Bridge]
I like my truck (I like my truck)
I like my girlfriend (I like my girlfriend)
I like to take her out to dinner
I like a movie now and then

But I love this bar
It's my kind of place
Just trollin' around the dance floor
Puts a big smile on my face
No cover charge, come as you are
Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar
Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar

We got divorcees and a big bouncer man
An old jukebox and a real bad band
We got waitresses and we got barflies
A dumb-ass and a wise-guy
If you get too drunk just sleep out in your car
Reason number 672 why
Hmm, hmm, hmm I love this bar
Play it on out boys
Beer-thirty's over
Got to take it on home

Dans le club j'fais un malheur, à l'école y'a un after
J'en dis pas plus, c'est dans les toilettes que ça suce
J’quitte mon palais de solitude, j'écris avec ma langue sur des palais
Place vide à côté de moi dans le bus, doigt dans le cul si j't'emballe
Me passe pas la laisse j'suis mal à l'aise, j'voulais juste m'amuser
Je me mens à moi-même, cartouche d'encre dans le barillet
Luji dis-nous qui t'es ?
Le juge va pas m'acquitter
Pas de glace que du verre pilé
Seul dans la foule j'arrête de respirer

Le caleçon plein de transpiration
J'lui tire son t-shirt comme à la récréation
J'pose le 9milli en vestiaire
J'l'ai croisée, je l'avais pas dans mon bestiaire
Il neige sur ma Tour Eiffel
Sur la piste j’leur parle en sous-titres FR
Refoulé pour une paire d'Asics, askip
Personne ne me connaît comme Dylan, Harris
La peinture fluo cache le sang sur mon torse
Pour se comprendre on textote en morse
Un gilet jaune et un gilet par balle dans le coffre
J’monte, je valide mon entrée en Enfer
T'inquiète on fera le soixante-neuf à l'envers
J’fête la fin du début de l'année scolaire
J’fête la fin du début, j’fête la fin du début de l’année scolaire
Mon sac est prêt depuis trop longtemps
J'ai une bonne raison d’venir en avance
J’paye la tournée (j’paye la tournée)
J’danse comme un teubé (j’danse comme un teubé)
Selfie sur ma carte d'identité
J’la recrute pour un blowjob d'été

Déchiffre mes rébus, j'découpe les sexes dans des revues porno
Elles grattent toutes à l'arbre comme le renard, j'suis perché comme corbeau

Clubbing for, Clubbing for Colombine

[Couplet 4 : Foda C]
Je sèche les cours pour aller mouiller ses lèvres
J'crève de chaud dans son sexe et j'meurs de froid jonché au sol comme un cadavre
Si on meurt de soif ce soir c'est pas grave
Les jurons ne suffisent plus à leur faire du mal
Alors je leur jette mes fleurs au visage
Il y a de la poudre à canon dans la recette du bonheur
On m'a mis devant la télé toute la journée
Comme une voiture garé sur une place handicapé avec les warning
Wa wa wa, j'ai uriné dans le long fleuve tranquille
Des tatouages Malabar #PrisonBreak
Avant de mourir je veux me faire un grec
J'm’assois toujours à côté d'elle
Parce qu'elle a apporte son matériel
Je l'aime parce qu'elle partage ma haine, des autres, des autres
J'dénonce les autres, j'défends les juifs
La boîte de nuit est atteinte de vaginisme
Faut que je sois plus le viril que le vigile
Mets de la javel dans cette piscine de sang
Si j'descends de mon nuage alors Dieu aussi
La peau violette sous la lumière noire
Au bout du tunnel, y'a des embouteillages
Pour avoir son num' y'aura emboucanage
Tu m'as quitté et la mort m'a trompé
Ce soir je casse la bouteille de Dom Pé'
Ma braguette veut croquer la vie à pleines dents
J'déprime dans le club à peine rentré d'dans

But I'm as blue as a boy can be

Then I'm walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel

Saw the ghost of Elvis
On Union Avenue
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland
Then I watched him walk right through
Now security they did not see him
They just hovered around his tomb
But there's a pretty little thing
Waiting for The King
Down in the Jungle Room

Then I'm walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis

When you haven't got a prayer
But boy you've got a prayer in Memphis

Now Muriel plays piano
Every Friday at the Hollywood
And they brought me down to see her
And they asked me if I would
Do a little number
And I sang with all my might
And she said
""Tell me are you a Christian child?""
And I said ""Ma'am I am tonight""

And it came upon me wave on wave
You're the reason I'm still here
Am I the one you were sent to save
And it came upon me wave on wave

I wondered out into the water
And I thought that I might drown

Just know I was going down
That's when she found me
Not afraid anymore
She said you know I always had you baby
Just waiting for you to find what you were looking for

This is a call to the color-blind
This is an IOU

Tied up in something true

Someday I'll be so damn much more
Cause I'm bigger than my body gives me credit for

Shed this skin I've been tripping in

Someday I'll be so damn much more
Cause I'm bigger than my body gives me credit for
Cause I'm bigger than my body now

[Bridge]
Maybe I'll tangle in the power lines
And it might be over in a second's time
But I'll gladly go down in a flame
If a flame's what it takes to remember my name
To remember my name

[Pre-Chorus]
Yes, I'm grounded
Got my wings clipped
I'm surrounded by all this pavement
Guess I'll circle
While I'm waiting for my fuse to dry
For my fuse to dry
Wait for my fuse to dry

[Chorus]
Someday I'll fly
Someday I'll soar
Someday I'll be so damn much more
Cause I'm bigger than my body
I'm bigger than my body
I'm bigger than my body now",John Mayer,2004,"[96, 94]",2
387,I Melt,"[Verse 1]
When you light those candles
Up there on that mantle, setting the mood
Well, I just lie there staring
Silently preparing to love on you
Well, I can feel the heat
From across the room
Ain't it wild what a little flame can make you wanna do?

[Chorus]
I melt, every time you look at me that way
It never fails
Anytime, any place
This burn in me is the coolest thing I've ever felt
I melt

[Verse 2]
Don't know how you do it
I love the way I lose it, every time
What's even better is knowing that forever you're all mine
The closer you get, the more my body aches
One little stare from you is all it takes

[Chorus]
I melt, every time you look at me that way
It never fails
Anytime, any place
This burn in me is the coolest thing I've ever felt
I melt

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I melt (I melt), every time you look at me that way
It never fails (Fails)
Anytime, any place
This burn in me is the coolest thing I've ever felt
I melt (I melt)

[Outro]
Every time you look at me that way (I just melt)
I melt (I just melt)
I melt",Rascal Flatts,2004,[81],1
388,Tough Little Boys,"I never once, backed down from a punch
I'd take it square on the chin
Well I found out fast a bullys just that and you got to stand up to him
So I didn't cry when I got a black eye as bad as it hurt I just grinned
But when tough little boys grow up to be Dads
They turn into big babies again
Scared me to death when took your first steps
Well I'd fall everytime you fell down
Your first day of school
I cried like a fool, I followed your school bus to town
Well I didn't cry when ol Yeller died
At least not in front of my friends
But when tough little boys grow up to be
Dads they turn into big babies again
Well I'm a grown man and as strong as I am
Well sometimes it's hard to believe
One little girl with little blonde curls can totally terrify me
If you were to ask my wife would just laugh
She'd say I know all about men
How tough little boys grow up to be Dads
They turn into big babies again
Well I know one day I'll give you away
And I'm goin to stand there and smile
When I get home and I'm all alone
I'll sit in your room for awhile
Cause when tough little boys grow up to be
Dads they turn into big babies again",Gary Allan,2004,[88],1
389,One More Chance,"[Intro]
All you hoes calling here for my daddy, get off his dick
Like that, mommy?
*Beep*
Hi, daddy, how you doing? This is Tyiest
I was thinking about you last night, mm
You actin' like you can't call me no more 'cause you busy and all of that
But you trying to tell me it wasn't good?
*Beep*
That shit is real fucked up what you did
I hooked you up with my girl and shit
You fucked her every time you see her
You don't even say shit to her, you know what I'm saying?
And all that bitch do is call me all day talking about you
""Why the fuck B.I.G. don't want me?""
*Beep*
Yo, B.I.G., this is Quita
Kenya told me she saw you and Shanie at the mall and I know you ain't fucking her
You fucked with me last night
That's my best friend and we don't get down like that
*Beep*
Yeah, motherfucker, this is Stephanie
I was waiting outside for your ass for like a fucking hour
I don't know what's going on, motherfuckers trying to rob me
You be disappearing and shit, I'm waiting in the cold
What the fuck is going on?
When you get in give me a fucking call, alright?

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
When it comes to sex, I'm similar to the Thrilla in Manila
Honeys call me ""Bigga the Condom Filler""
Whether it's stiff tongue or stiff dick
Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit, now check this shit
I got the pack of Rough Riders in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the epilogue by James Todd Smith
I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with a dick, make your kidney shift
Here we go, here we go, but I'm not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I wear thirteens, know what I mean?
I'll fuck around and hit you with the Hennessy dick
Mess around and go blind, don't get to see shit (See shit)
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder
It doesn't matter, skinny or fat or light-skinned or black
Baby, I drop these Boricua mamis screaming ¡Ay papi!
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
I only smoke blunts if they rolled proper
Look, I gotcha caught up with the drunk flow
Fuck tae kwon do, I tote a four-four
For niggas getting mad 'cause they bitch chose me
A big black motherfucker with G, you see
All I do is separate the game from the truth
Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Getting physical like Olivia Newt
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia
So give me a ho, a bankroll and a bag of weed
I'm guaranteed to fuck her 'til her nose bleed
Even if your new man's a certified mack
You'll get that H-Town in ya, you want that old thing back

[Chorus: Total & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
I got that good dick, girl, you didn't know?
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
I got that good dick, girl, you didn't know?
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
I got that good dick, girl, you didn't know?
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Is my mind playing tricks, like Scarface and Bushwick
Willie D, having nightmares of girls killing me?
She mad because what we had didn't last
I'm glad because her cousin let me hit the ass
Fuck the past, let's dwell on the 500SL, the E&J and ginger ale
The way my pockets swell to the rims with Benjamins
Another honey's in the crib? Please, send her in
I fuck non-stop, lick my lips a lot
Used to lick the clits a lot, but licking clits had to stop
'Cause y'all don't know how to act when the tongue go down below
Peep the funk flow
Really, though, I got the cleanest, meanest penis
You never seen this stroke of genius
So take off your Timb boots and your body suit
I mean the spandex and hit my man next
Sex get rougher when it come to the nut buster
Pussy crusher, black nasty motherfucker
I don't chase 'em, I replace 'em
And if I'm caressing 'em I'm undressing 'em
Fuck what you heard, who's the best in New York?
Fulfilling fantasies without that nigga Mr. Roarke
Or Tattoo, I got you wrapped around my dick
And when I nut I got to split
Shit, backshots is my position
I got you wishing for an intermission, fuck the kissin'
Lickin' you down to your belly button, I ain't frontin'
They don't call me big for nuttin' all of a sudden

[Chorus: Total]
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance",The Notorious B.I.G.,2004,[100],1
