0,Hello,"[Verse 1]
Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

[Pre-Chorus]
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

[Chorus]
So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Bridge]
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Anymore

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

1,Sorry,"[Written by Julia Michaels, Justin Tranter, and Justin Bieber]

[Verse 1]
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Verse 2]
I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Bridge]
I'm not just trying to get you back on me
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh

You used to call me on my
You used to, you used to
Yeah

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 1]
Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
‘Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling

That can only mean one thing

[Verse 2]
Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Bridge]
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 1]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Verse 2]
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care

I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

Your man on the road, he doin' promo
You said, ""Keep our business on the low-low""
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
'Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Drivin' through the gated residential
Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it but your friends know

And all these motherfuckers want a relapse

[Intro]
I guess right now you've got the last laugh

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin', or, I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering
I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

[Verse 2]
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people
We can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners
I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?

Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here

I don't even really know what you intended
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous

You wanted my heart but I just liked your tattoos
Poured it down, so I poured it down

I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

[Verse 1]
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin' with you?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge

[Refrain]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'

I'm tryin' to keep it alive
And not compromise the feeling we love
You're tryin' to keep it deprived
And only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror
I know what you scared of
The feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name
I'll let the people know this is somethin' you can blame
On yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I'ma break out and then hide every lock

I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music
I say bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

24,Die A Happy Man,"[Verse 1]
Real life ain't nothing like a movie
Truly, before I make mind
Imma puff another dooby and take five
Rub up your mothers booty, suck a couple boobies
And die a happy man
Real life ain't nothing like they say it is
That's why I rap like I'm on some escape that shit
Use my poems to communicate with aliens
Hijack a UFO and die a happy man
Real life ain't about a revolution
Or any movement that tells you how you're meant to do this
I got this proof
It's forgetter medicine, it helps me pretend
John Lennon was a President that died a happy man
Real life don't care if you're ignorant to the factory
Calling me wack? so go ahead son
Start ignoring the rant and talk your shit back homie
I ain't concerned

[Hook 1 Jane Tyrrell]
You can expect what you will
Just for thrill
But I don't care, no no
You can say what you like
You can hate me in spite
But I don't care, no no
[Jane & Tuka]
You can ask me all day
I ain't gonna sway
Cause I don't care, no no
So don't tell me your deal
Just, show me your real
Cause I don't care, no no

[Verse 2]
Real life don't care for your opinion's, your minion's
For instance, it's like ""shut the fuck up
Or work on keeping it brief"", but see
These words are my freedom of speech
And this verse is my reason to speak
Before I cease to exist
I got my feet on this Earth
So Imma use a day to soothe the pain
Until I'm deep in the dirt
So when I'm layed out, cruising away
You can take a seat in a hearse and choose to say
I died a happy man

[Hook 2 Tuka & Jane]
(Some day's)
I don't give a fuck about nothing
(Yeah your daddy ripped you, some days)
I don't give a fuck about nothing
(Your mother ain't good looking, some days)
I don't give a fuck about nothing
I spend all my time bluffing
Don't get me wrong I'm just like you
Trying to find out what the hell is going on

And on and on and on on
On and on and on, yeah
What's going on and on and on and on on
On and on and on

[Hook 1]

[Hook 4]
See me up on my feet
Just trying to dance a little
Too drunk to speak
You see me passing out
Out on my porch, maybe I forgot my keys
But why we're all playing cool
They call me a fool
That's probably true
But if, you say I'm a monster, why
Would I play the imposter I
I've got nothing to prove

It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose

I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Verse 2]
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

[Chorus 2]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms

33,Break Up In A Small Town,"[Spoken Verse 1]
I knew I'd see her around
I'd be at some party, she'd show up and I'd be walking out
Or across some parking lot hiding behind her sister
I'd look up, she'd be at the red light beside me
In that white Maxima with the sticker on the back
I'd act like I didn't see her
We'd pay at the same pumps
Flip through the same stations
And slow down for the same curves
Run around with the same crowds
We just needed some time
She could get on with her life and I'd get on with mine
Thought I would be fine, heh, but maybe not
I knew she'd find a way to get over me
But I'd never thought that...

[Chorus]
She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around
But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town

[Spoken Verse 2]
For a while I guess they were keeping it low-key
But now it's like these county lines are closing in on me
I see 'em everywhere together
And it's hitting a little too close to home
She's so far gone, but she didn't go far
She was over me before the grass grew back where she used to park her car
She's leaving those same marks in someone else's yard
In someone else's arms right down the road
And I never thought that...

[Chorus]
She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around
But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town

[Bridge]
Her mailbox is seven minutes from mine
And I drive into town sometimes I see you sittin' there with him
And I wanna jump out
I wanna fight
I wanna say, ""... that guy!"" but I can't
It's my fault, I let her go
I never thought that...

[Chorus]
She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
They don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around

Had her rain dance on the dick, ass jumping
Running through the pussy like a nigga going jogging
Fuck a little Louis, put it in a bitch pocket
Put a pic with me on the 'gram, now you popping
Where your ass was at when I was trapping in the store?
Had to struggle to get where I'm at and sell dope
Jackie Chan moves got game in the choke
Gas rolling up in the blunt, Amoco

Juugin' out the stove and we still bangin', honest
Blowing on the O, yo, we call that ho an onion

Man, where your ass was at when we took the city over?
Where your ass was at when all they'd ask was ""what's the hold up?""
Where your ass was at when niggas first got the news?
Now your ass around because we're paying back dues
Where were you when all the dogs needed help?
Lawyers and the commissary ain't gon' pay itself
Where your ass was at when we recorded in the bathroom?
Where your ass was at? I take attendance like a classroom
Man I ain't got no choice
'Cause nowadays I swear this shit done changed up for the boy
I'm self-made, selfish with my women, self-employed
I'll buy the neighbor's house if they complain about the noise
Man, where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at? Last winter was the coldest
Fuck where you was at, I had the 6 on my shoulders

Where your ass was at dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?
Where your ass was at dog, when bitches didn't need me?
Where your ass was at dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at dog? You made me pull this gun out

60 for a walk through, bitch don't panic
Had them bitches fall through fucking like a savage
Heard you tryna swim in the ocean no jacket
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Serve a lot of dog food, call you a mutt
Where your ass was at dog, when I was on my come-up?
The reason I'm here today 'cause I ain't never gave up

Everyone knows how this lifestyle is dangerous
But I love it, the rush is amazin'
Celebrate nightly and everyone rages
I found how to cope with my angers
I'm swimmin' in money
Swimmin' in liquor, my liver is muddy
But it's all good, I'm still sippin' this bubbly
This shit is lovely, this shit ain't random, I didn't get lucky

No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed
By the baddest bitch, not Trina but I swear to God
This bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, ""Hey, what's good?""
""Sorry I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good.""
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, ""Nah, I was the same without it.""
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
Before I started callin' bitches ""bitches"" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
You wasn't sweatin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Verse 3]
I want a real love, dark skinned Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do'
Nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt 'fore she leave
I'ma need my shirt back (nigga, you know how it go)

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Interlude: George W. Bush]
There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once… shame on… shame on you. Fool me, you can't get fooled again

[Bridge]
Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you
Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you

[Verse 4]
My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script, the bitch probably couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)

Been waiting for the first day you say yes
I play this game the best and came just to make breath an extension of blessings

But the play is before and the mess on the floor is the best
I adore the way you seem unsure when the world's so obviously yours

I just wanna be good for you, everything I said I wouldn't do I would for you
Shining up and polishing this wood for you
Waiting in the hood for you, wonder would you help a brother out, I'm going out of my mind

Got my sentences running on and my senses is tripping
Come with me if you feel it
I promise it'll be so good

If I do time, then who would really write me?

And the two of us went up in smoke
Love isn't all that it seems I did you wrong
I'll stay here with you until this dream is gone

[Chorus]
I've been sleepwalking
Been wandering all night
Trying to take what’s lost and broke
And make it right
I've been sleepwalking
Too close to the fire
But it's the only place that I can hold you tight
In this burning house

[Verse 2]
See you at a party and you look the same
I could take you back but people don't ever change
Wish that we could go back in time
I'd be the one you thought you'd find
Love isn't all that it seems I did you wrong
I'll stay here with you until this dream is gone

[Chorus]
I've been sleepwalking
Been wandering all night
Trying to take what’s lost and broke
And make it right
I've been sleepwalking
Too close to the fire
But it's the only place that I can hold you tight
In this burning house

[Bridge]
The flames are getting bigger now
In this burning house
I can hold on to you somehow
In this burning house
Oh, and I don't want to wake up
In this burning house

[Chorus]
I've been sleepwalking
Been wandering all night
Trying to take what’s lost and broke
And make it right

47,Hide Away,"[Verse 1]
Boys seem to like the girls who laugh at anything
The ones who get undressed before the second date
Girls seem to like the boys who don't appreciate
All the money and the time that it takes

[Pre-Chorus 1]
To be fly as a mother
Got my both eyes out for Mr. Right
Guessing I just don't know where to find 'em
But I hope they all come out tonight

[Chorus]
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
I'm a good good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?

[Verse 2]
Boys seem to like the girls who like to kiss and tell
Talking them up about the things they do so well
But I'd rather find a boy who is down for the chase
Putting in the time that it takes

[Pre-Chorus 2]
To be fly as a mother
To supply all of my heart's demands
Suit and tie, cause undercover
He's gonna save my life like Superman

[Chorus]
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
I'm a good good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?

Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Won't somebody tell me, tell me?
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go

Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?

Oh yah yah bitch, back up off me
You don't know me, I'm too clean, I'm too holy, bitch I'm godly
I only go for real niggas who don't brag 'bout what they bought me
Cause they know I got a bag, gotta fuck me up some commas
If I fuck and make you cum, you got to promise not to stress me
Don't be blowin' up my phone and don't be leavin' voice messages
Sayin' ""I can do you right, do you better than your exes""
I told that nigga to stop it, he was talkin' out his necklace
See the difference with me, I never needed niggas, ever
I'll leave 'em where I met 'em, I ain't trippin' off no extras
Goons in the cut try to talk you out your necklace
If you ever disrespect me, pussy, don't be disrespectful
I said woo, I said I know, I know, I know
He heard about me, he was waitin' on me at the door
I said woo, yeah that mink all on the floor
Used to bust this shit at skatin', 6 to 9, come in at 4
We got glow sticks for you ho chicks, bitch don't act like you don't know this
I'm very antisocial, social network ain't my motion (I don't move like that)
I show no emotions, nigga's bitches it's disgustin'

Back up off me, they want my backs in coffins

Back when I couldn't afford to get it mixed and mastered, homie
My mama fronted me that money so it's no backup, homie
Bitch so back up off me
Bank account look like a ballot, homie, yeah it's checked up
My niggas packin', you get to trippin', they unpackin', homie
Yeah I overdo it, yeah that's salad, homie
Yeah I'm overdressed and ain't no salad on me
Me and DeJ together, holy matrimony
Yohhh, it's hard to smile and shit
When they ain't free Juan, I got real ones on trial and shit
Fuck all my peers unless we talkin' bout Belle Isle and shit
The check is seven figures, I might try and dial the shit
And if I fuck and make you cum, don't be blowin' up my phone
Lately I've been messin' with girls who tend to own shit on their own
I turn dusk into dawn, turn my chair to a throne
Fuck her off in the whip, make her take Uber home
Cold to the chromosome, I grew up without a hammock
I did everything except panic, feel me? Finally Famous the family
And we expandin' on the top floor like we tannin'
She throwin' tantrums
She gon' hold this dick like a Grammy
I give her bomb D and do damage, she like...

It would be no watching movies on my couch

Basic, nigga I was born in the basement
Shape shift, nigga, I think like a spaceship
False, oh-nah-nah-nah
I am so different than y'all, so far apart
The way that I balance the bars
I never fall, and if I do I just call
The almighty yellow star, God
Lyrically I'm Optimus Prime

So open your eyes, the joke's on you guys
And you ain't gotta be a mason to see through
Some of this shit on occasion

Shorty what?
The dance that you doing is dumb
How they do it where you from?

[Verse 3: Missy Elliott]
I'm like kak-a-rak-a-rak-rak-a-rak-a-rak
Make a new track, make 'em fall on they crack
Give 'em a slap, appetizer and smack
I'm so fat in the back, make the boys all collapse
Yeah, when I rap they be all on my jack
Boys wanna jump on this pussy cat (Prrrr)
Got a new idea, let me switch it
Man, I'm so futuristic
Big lips and big, big, big hips
Body be thick like a biscuit
Different, rippin' shit, microphone grippin' it
Gettin' these Benjamins, new car, whippin' it
Uh, I'm so far ahead of ya'll, man I'm on top of the stars
I don't care none of you are, blah-blah-blah-blah
You best to go rewrite your bars

You slide up close to me
Tear our t-shirts off each other
Your hands all over me

But one more time is not enough
One last kiss and then you’re a goner
And I’m here wishing you could stay a little longer

I remember when I first met you
Sipping coffee in a corner booth
You were twirling your hair
And I just had to stare
For a minute or two

I was laughing at your stack of books
Then you shot me that smile
Hey beautiful girl, in your own little world
Let me in it

You got all of my attention
And you ain't even trying

But you just doing your thing
Ain't nobody ever seen nothing like you

When you're wearing them worn out jeans
Purple untied shoestrings
You're a light in the dark

In front of everybody
So baby come and kiss me

Fake IDs to get into those spring break bars

And I'm like ""Honestly, I don't know nothing about mopeds""

Ooh, it's too real
Chromed out mirror, I don't need a windshield
Banana seat, a canopy on two wheels
Eight hundred cash, that's a hell of a deal
I'm headed...

Downtown, cruising through the alley
Tip-toeing in the street like ballet
Pulled up, moped to the valet
White walls on the wheels like mayonnaise
Dope, my crew is ill, and all we need is two good wheels
Got gas in the tank, cash in the bank
And a bad little mama with her ass in my face
I'ma lick that, stick that, break her off, Kit-Kat
Snuck her in backstage, you don't need a wristband

Killing the game, 'bout to catch a body
Passed the Harley, Dukie on the Ducati

Goddamn, man, everybody got Bugattis
But I'ma keep it hella 1987
Head into the dealership and drop a stack and cop a Kawasaki
I'm stunting on everybody, hella raw, pass the Wasabi
I'm so low that my scrotum's almost dragging up on the concrete
My seat is leather, alright, I'm lying, it's pleather
But girl, we could still ride together, oh
You don't need an Uber, you don't need a cab
Fuck a bus pass, you got a moped, man
She got 1988 Mariah Carey hair
Very rare, mom jeans on her derriere
Throwing up the West Side as we tear in the air
Stop by Pike Place, throwing fish to a player

Cause I'm too damn quick, I'm too damn slick
Whole downtown yelling out ""Who that is?""

I'm perusing down Fourth and they watching me
I do a headstand, the eagle lands on my seat
Well hello, but baby, the kickstand ain't free
Now do you or do you not wanna ride with me?
I got one girl, I got two wheels
She a big girl, but ain't a big deal
I like a big girl, I like 'em sassy
Going down the backstreet listening to Blackstreet
Running around the whole town
Neighbors yelling at me like, ""You need to slow down""
""Going thirty-eight, Dan, chill the fuck out
Mow your damn lawn and sit the hell down""
If I only had one helmet, I would give it to you, give it to you
Cruising down Broadway, girl, what a wonderful view, wonderful view
There's layers to this shit, player, tiramisu, tiramisu
Let my coat-tail drag but I ain't tearing my suit, tearing my suit

Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swear you'd moved overseas
That's what you said when you left me

[Pre-Chorus]
You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

[Chorus]
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

[Bridge]
It's hard to admit that everything just takes me back
To when you were there, to when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on just in case it hasn't gone
'Cause I still care, do you still care?

It was just like a movie

To drown out every distraction
It’s time we made it happen

We just been smoking a bowl
We don't got no time to roll
I'm always out on the road
She don't got time for a whole
Little bit of time that we have
We used to purchase a half
It don't be no time to smoke
I'm always throwing on clothes
She always throwing a fit
We don't got no time for no sex
I just put milk in the bowl
She don't be cooking at all
She just put weed in the bowl
She don't have time for herself
She putting points on the board, yes
You know she carry her own
You know she carry a child
She wake up at crack of dawn
She don't be cracking a smile
So when she packing the bowl
I grab her, I tell her

Slow it down for a second
Break it down, ooh

We used to Netflix and roll
I used to pass her the smoke
She used to laugh at my jokes
You pat my back when I choke
Wish we were stuck in our ways
We way too young to get old
We stuck together like oowops
We smoke to Fetty, sing ZooWap
Traphouse 3, Guwop

It would be no time at all
We went from White Owls to Raws
We went from joints to a bowl
She need a second to breathe
We need an actual smoke sesh

When she involved with a boss
Please don't get lost in the sauce
Please don't get lost in the sauce

Told me her mom was a ho

I give her Perc for esteem

I take the molly, it's clean
I push the whip with the wings
I gotta be overseas
I gotta be on the pedal
I push it down to the floor

I keep some Goyard and 'gars
I smoke out all of my cars

You smell the smoke in the seats

I don’t know if this is wrong, because someone else is telling me that it’s wrong. But I feel this so let me just like try my best not to let this happen again.  We weren’t necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions

You can’t be hard on yourself for it, these are the cards you were given so you have to understand that’s not who you are. You know you’re trying to be the best you can be, but that’s all you can do. If you don’t give it all you got, you’re only cheating yourself give it all you got but if it ends up happening, it ends up happening

That’s what happening with me, it’s like “God, I’m giving it all I’ve got, sometimes I’m weak and I’m going to do it.” And it’s like I’m not giving myself grace, I’m just like understanding that’s how it is",Justin Bieber,2015,"[85, 74, 62, 43]",4

If you at a restaurant and got a iced coffee
And the waiter been refillin' that without a word of caution
And you get your fuckin' bill and you can see he double charged ya
For the coffee and you told 'em there's a problem, sing along like
Ohh, don't double charge me for that
Don't double charge me, we like
Ohh, don't double charge me for that
Don't do it to yourself
'Cause I might just ask what the ice cube's worth
What the ice cube's worth
That's the only differentiator making this a non-free perk
And I might make work more difficult for you than it need be (Brr)
So think about it, take a minute, let it breathe, B
But think about it, bruh, you saw me get the burger with the bacon on the side
After looking at the price of the side of just bacon
And comparing it to the what the difference in the cheeseburger
Versus the bacon cheeseburger was and making my decision
I would hate to be the waiter tryna tell me something different
I'ma get on Yelp in a minute and review
This piece of shit place like only a kike know how
Unless you take the extra coffee off I might get loud unless you...
Oh, it was just an accident?
You didn't even mean that
You didn't even... that was... that's... I'm so embarrassed",Lil Dicky,2015,"[87, 93, 89, 94, 100, 98, 71]",7

Buy the things you can't afford for ya
Cause he must have did a lot for ya
I just fell back with it
And now your past is behind you
Like the car with the strap in it
Thank god that's finished

92,Backroad Song,"[Verse 1]
Barbed wire fence carving out a hillside
Cutting holes in the midday sun
Like a postcard framed in a windshield covered in dust
I love the rhythm of an old grey blacktop, 33's just whistling by
Steer the wheel, one handed on a two lane, hugging that line
I got the windows down, no one else around singing

[Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Freedom is the miles I'm rolling on
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Out here cruising to a backroad song
I feel the wheels like a melody, like a radio dialing in strong
Come on, come on sing along, sing along to my backroad song
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2]
I hit the brakes for an old New Holland, hammer down and pass him on up
The breeze smells like a summertime hay field's just been cut
I got the windows down, way out of town singing…

[Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Freedom is the miles I'm rolling on
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Out here cruising to a backroad song
I feel the wheels like a melody, like a radio dialing in strong
C'mon, c'mon sing along, sing along to my backroad song
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 3]
The only way today could get better, girl what I'm thinking
Is I can pick you up, you slide in this truck
And I can hear you singing

Let me hear you sing it

Freedom is the miles we're rolling on

C'mon, c'mon sing along, sing along to my backroad song

This is my backroad song

Pay attention, none of this is happenin' by accident
Listen, I don't slack a bit
Game plan's solid, no cracks in it
Said I want a billion now, nothing less is adequate
Grab a check, cashin' it
I was born addicted to the money
Difference now I finally found a way to manage it
What you think I'm paid for, nothin'?
You must be mistakin' someone
I had to go make that fundin'
I'm tryna be great at somethin'
Spend, not saving nothin'
Flyin' from the Bay to London
They say money talks but you ain't saying nothin', shh

Sign CDs and I sign breasts

Last time we argued eight straight days
I learned my lesson, I got straight As

I just left L.A., barely caught the plane
Fuckin' TSA, swear a nigga ran for it
Ain't used to this fame shit
This you-all-know-my-name-shit
Me, I'm just the same kid
That fucked around and made it
Fucked over my main chick
Damn, she was the main chick
Thinkin' 'bout the game
I shouldn't have played, but I played it

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
And now I'm missing your love, I'ma roll up
I'm faded once again, ooh, I don’t know where I am
But I just know I'm drifting far from you (ooh)
I'm tryna keep my head strong, but my heart (woah)
Won't just let me grow away from you
Don't you know we're drifting off, drifting off?
I know you think that it's my fault for falling off
All this hope and disregard, drifting off
I know you think there ain't no fault, I fall apart
Ooh, and now I'm missing your love

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
(Now, I mean, yeah)
Uh, I blame it on the distance
That's why I'm fuckin' with these bitches
These numbers in my phone
A text pops up, she's like, ""Who is this?""
You probably got a mistress
Probably every week it switches
Now is this cause for concern?
And should I be suspicious?
I'm overseas trippin', a million miles away
And she's still in L.A., my mom's out in the Bay
And these overseas minutes add up, that's a lot to pay
I can pay it, yeah I know, but it's the excuse I say
She's been tryna track me down
I feel like I'm cattin' now
Dodgin' her when she's the one
I'm out here trippin', actin' wild
Start to wonder if I've changed
I'm like how could that be now?
Would these bitches be here really
If I wasn't rappin' now?
Now tell me now

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'm faded once again, yeah, I don’t know where I am
But I just know I'm drifting far from you, ooh
I'm tryna keep my head strong, but my heart
Won't just let me grow away from you
Don't you know we're drifting off, drifting off?
I know you think, think that it's my fault for falling off
All this hope and disregard, drifting off, yeah
I know you think there ain't no fault, I fall apart
Ooh, and now I'm missing your love

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
(You tell me, uh, yeah)
Uh, I'm just so conflicted
It's been so long since we've kicked it
And I can't lie, I've missed it
But somewhere the current shifted
And now I'm somewhere else
Far away, feel like we drifted
Hard to face the facts
I'm drinkin' to escape 'em, then get lifted
Get swept under a rug, 'till I'm trippin' on a pile
Get a change, somethin' different for a while
Yeah we grew apart with time
We ain't kicked it in a while
But I still think about you now
Without you, see there's differences now
But shit happens, how could we have known?
Nothin' can prepare us
From sleepin' at your parents, now to sold-out shows in Paris
To parties at my hotel, ashin' blunts up off my terrace
Tell me, how'd we ever come to live this careless?
Tell me now

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'm faded once again, I don’t know where I am, ooh
But I just know I'm drifting far from you, ooh, yeah
I'm tryna keep my head strong, but my heart
Won't just let me grow away from you, ha (ooh)
Don't you know we're drifting off, drifting off?
I know you think that it's my fault for falling off
All this hope and disregard, drifting off
I know you think there ain't no fault, I fall apart

103,Hallelujah,"[Verse 1]
Now I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do ya?
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing ""Hallelujah""

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Verse 2]
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Verse 3]
You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to ya?
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Verse 4]
I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool ya
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord of song
With nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah


[Additional Lyrics]
Baby, I've been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
There was a time you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show it to me, do you?
And remember when I moved in you
The holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah",Leonard Cohen,2015,"[61, 40]",2

You overstand, I'm incomplete
Apparently, gotta know I hate that
How I'm supposed to take that?
Boo'd up, missing all of that
Gotta be laying in that
Rolled up, put a flame to that

Be patient
Won't you pull up to me now?

Whoa, baby let's go down a little road nobody else knows
Just me and you parked on the edge of the world
That's how I wanna see you girl
Yeah, let me see you girl

[Verse 2]
Whatcha think about taking that chance
Taking a ride, taking my hand
Kicking this crowd, ditching this club?
This night's been waiting on us
Ooh, ooh, save your best moves, ooh, ooh
Yeah, 'til I get us where we're getting to

[Chorus]
Girl you're tearing that dance floor up
Let me see you do it in the bed of my truck
You sure know how to shake it alright
Let me see you do it in the Tennessee moonlight
Whoa, baby let's go down a little road nobody else knows
Just me and you park on the edge of the world
That's how I wanna see you girl

[Bridge]
I can see you getting my tailgate rocking
Moving your hips like wind moves cotton
You can get the whole wide country side hopping

[Pre-Chorus]
Bring the beat back
Aw, come on with me girl

[Chorus]
Yeah, you're tearing that dance floor up
Let me see you do it in the bed of my truck
You sure know how to shake it alright
Let me see you do it in the Tennessee moonlight

You feel so bad, I was alone and not alright
Stop feeling sorry now that you know I'm doing fine
Now it's water under the bridge

Don't feel so foolish now that you found somebody new
When miles alway what's a lonely heart to do
But I couldn't wait 'til you were ready to love me true
Now it's water under the bridge

You held your love dangling right above my head
We would not touch lying together in bed
It does not matter all of the things unsaid
Now it's water under the bridge

We spent the years running along the winding road
I found new love and she can carry my whole load
She's not you and we both know the truth is cold
Like the water under the bridge

Do you want me back? Do you want me back?
Oh no
Do you want me back? Do you want me back?
No no no
Do you want me back? Do you want me back?
No no no

You smiled at me but I could only see the pain
I know it's sad, what we had is down the drain
And you still love me but it'll never be the same
It is water under the bridge
Now it's water under the bridge
Now it's water under the bridge
Now it's water under the bridge",Vista Kicks,2015,[70],1

112,Tennessee Whiskey,"[Verse 1]
Used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love I'd known
But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom
And brought me back from bein' too far gone

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

[Verse 2]
I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of a bottle's always dry
But when you poured out your heart, I didn't waste it
'Cause there's nothin' like your love to get me high

And you're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

Na na na na

[Hook]
Music to my ear, you my melody
Late nights, feeling sick, you my remedy
I remember every moment, every memory
Sippin' on you, fuck sippin' on the Hennessy
Have you livin' in the hills out in Beverly
Yeah, we coulda been forever, been a legacy
But you tryna fight, claimin' that we enemies
Thinking 'bout the jealousy, forgettin' all the chemistry, yeah

[Verse]
Whatever happened to ""Together 'til we seventy""?
We moved apart, girl, now we livin' separately
I remember you, can't you remember me?
Loving you, my speciality, you my secret recipe
You helped me find myself, a part of my identity
My love, my oxygen, to me you a necessity
I hope this reaches you, if not, it's my serenity
Bars on my mind like I'm convicted for a felony
And ahh, that was a hard time
It's been a while since we talked, it's been a long time
I've been on my phone, checkin' if you online
Stalkin' up your page, wonder if you're on mine
Been a couple years, thought that I'd be over you
Still hold the tears when I think of holding you
You left and disappeared, I can't get a hold of you
I can't believe you'd do me wrong, was someone else controlling you?
'Cause after all the times, everything we been through
Every time you lie, I'd always defend you
And when I saw you cry, I'd just hold you gentle
For you I prayed to god, to me you like a temple
So tell me, did you love me or did you pretend to?
Everytime you touched me, was it even special?
Was I a priority or squeezed into the schedule?
Baby, you an angel, same time you the devil
After all the times, everything we been through
Every time you lie, I'd always defend you
And every time you'd cry, I'd just hold you gentle
For you I prayed to god, to me you like a temple

114,Life Is Worth Living,"[Verse 1]
Ended up on a crossroad
Tried to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Ooh show your grace
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
For the long journey ahead
Said it ain't over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

[Chorus]
Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again

[Verse 2]
Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin' down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
Cause my heart, it's just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent in an angel to help us out
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't ever over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

[Chorus]
Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again
Life is worth living again

[Bridge]
What I get from my reflection
Is a difference in perception?
From what the world may see
They tried to crucify me
I ain't perfect, won't deny
My reputation's on the line
So I'm working on a better me

[Chorus]
Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes
Only God can judge me
Life is worth living again
Another day

120,Break Up With Him,"[Produced by Shane McAnally]
[Music Video by Steve Condon]

[Verse 1]
Hey girl, wassup
I know it's late but I knew you'd pick it up
Naw, I ain't drunk
Okay, maybe I do have a little buzz, but
That song came on and I just thought
What harm could come from one little call
I know you say you're taken but I say
Girl you're takin' too long

[Chorus]
To tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
Is just wasting precious time
Girl you know it can't wait
Rip it off just like a Band-Aid
The way you look at me, girl, you can't pretend
I know you ain't in love with him
Break up with him

[Verse 2]
I know you don't wanna break his heart
But that ain't no good reason to be
Keeping us apart
Look, just tell him it's you, it ain't him
And maybe you can lie to him and say you'll
Still be friends
Whatever you got to say to get through to him
That you ain't in love
C'mon you can't deny that you and I
Kinda fit like a glove

[Chorus]
So tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
Is just wasting precious time
Girl you know it can't wait
Rip it off just like a Band-Aid
It ain't my business to be all up in
But I know you ain't in love with him
Break up with him
I know that you so done with him
Break up with him, break up with him

[Verse 3]
You would've hung up by now
If you weren't thinking it too
No pressure whatever
Just do what you gotta do
But if I was you

[Chorus]
I'd tell him that it's over
Then bring it on over
Stringing him along any longer girl
Is just wasting precious time
Girl you know it can't wait
Just rip it off just like a Band-Aid
Yeah, I know I said it but I'll say it again
I know you ain't in love with him
Break up with him
The way you look at me girl you can't pretend
I know you ain't in love with him
Break up with him
Just break up with him",Old Dominion,2015,"[64, 53, 48, 44, 47, 51, 54, 59, 64, 62, 67, 75, 76, 81, 80, 85, 89, 93, 89, 99]",20

I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me, and I walk alone
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

[Chorus]
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

[Verse 2]
I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What's fucked up, and everything's all right
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

[Chorus]
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me

Deep as the ocean
Blue like the sky

Of missing your loving
Haunts me at night
The ghosts are alive
All of the memories
Of serenity

Remember the day we were giving up
When you told me I didn't give you enough
And all of your friends were saying I'd be leaving you

This isn't the stain of a red wine, I'm bleeding love

Don't let me go, don't let me go

[Verse 2: Liam]
Say what you're feeling and say it now
'Cause I got the feeling you're walking out
And time is irrelevant when I've not been seeing ya
The consequences of falling out
Are something I’m having nightmares about
And these are the reasons I'm crying out to be with ya

125,We Are,"[Verse 1: Nate Ruess]
Give me a second I, I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom
Getting higher than the Empire State
My lover, she's waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking 'bout a scar
And I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget it
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies
You know, I'm trying hard to take it back
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home

Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter

Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
But our friends are back
So let's raise the cup

126,Get Used To It,"[Verse 1]
Used to live down by the beach
And I used to be good on my feet
And my fingers used to dance on every key
Now they're just pieces of meat

Used to wear a suit and tie
And I used to grab a birdie every night
Drive down to the hotel parking lot
Make monkey love in the street

Used to go to university
Used to be the head of varsity
Used to live inside this box with everyone noticing me
I used to leave the evening feeling right
I'll be with you each and every night
Chasing that horizon in our eyes

[Chorus]
You want a garden but you got a balcony
And you're always looking for some company
You want a say, well, what you got to say?
Give in to me, give in to me and see

Used to live down by Hyperion
Used to be a Californian
Way back when before my Missouri
Left not but this envy in my
Heart and soul
Apropos, you're beautiful
You're beautiful

You want a garden but you got a balcony
And you're always looking for some company
You want a say, well, what you gotta say?
Give in to me, give in to me
Give in to me

You want a garden but you got a balcony
And you're always looking for some company
You want a say, well what you gotta say?
Give in to me, give in to me and see

You want a garden but you got a mouth to feed
And you're always looking for some company
You want a say, well what you gotta say?
What you gotta say? What you gotta say? (Say)

When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how

[Pre-Chorus 1]
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well me, I fall in love with you every single day
I just wanna tell you I am

[Chorus]
So honey, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

[Verse 2]
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how

[Pre-Chorus 2]
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

[Chorus]
That, baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

[Chorus]
So baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars

Sending big waves into motion
Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion

And all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time?

[Chorus]
This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now, I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care
If nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got
A lot of fight left in me

[Verse 2]
Losing friends and I'm chasing sleep
Everybody's worried about me
In too deep, say I'm in too deep (In too deep)
And it's been two years, I miss my home
But there's a fire burning in my bones
Still believe
Yeah, I still believe

[Pre-Chorus]
And all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time?

We got history (history)
Got me feeling the nostalgia
When you look at me (look at me)
Thinking 'bout what could've happened
Or what could've been
Finally a face I know, ain't that a sight to see?
Take my time then take your clothes off
One more time, maybe
Actin' like you don't recall, it ain't impressin' me
Didn't come to see your friends, I know you came for me
Like your dress, but you fit better in my wrinkled tee
We moved on to newer things, but we got history

[Verse 1]
Put my feelings all aside
Don't know how to make it right
Pictures poppin' on my mind
All these occasions
Let's  work it out with me
I don't think it hurts to give another try on it
Ain't nobody here know you like I do
Ask all your friends if they know 'bout your size of shoes
How you like to cry when you laugh, when you off the booze
I moved on but I still remember a thing or two
I know you said ""gimme a hug,"" and I said ""gimme a break""
I wasn't trying my best, all the mistakes that I made
I'm learning that it ain't the right move
Learned from my mistakes, ain't that what the adults do?

[Chorus]
We got history (history)
Got me feeling the nostalgia
When you look at me (look at me)
Thinking 'bout what could've happened
Or what could've been
Finally a face I know, ain't that a sight to see?
Take my time then take your clothes off
One more time, maybe
Actin' like you don't recall, it ain't impressin' me
Didn't come to see your friends, I know you came for me
Like your dress, but you fit better in my wrinkled tee
We moved on to newer things, but we got history

[Verse 2]
Ayy, ayy, yuh
Bet you got nobody 'round to make your day better
Sun brighter, don't got too much time, so girl, let's fuck now
And talk later, put your pride aside and let me in
You know I got better since
You so good at self control, but maybe now it's time for change
I've been alone for so long, got the one
Didn't realize good ones exist in the world 'til I lost one
Eye for an eye makes the whole world go blind
Things I would give to feel your lips for the last time
Go and hang with your friends, I'll put this bullshit to end
I rained on your parade and I just wish you the best
I think it's time for me to bounce soon
I just wish I had someone to say ""I'm home"" to

[Chorus]
We got history (history)
Got me feeling the nostalgia
When you look at me (look at me)
Thinking 'bout what could've happened

135,Writing's On The Wall,"[Verse 1]
I've been here before
But always hit the floor
I've spent a lifetime runnin'
And I always get away
But with you I'm feeling something
That makes me want to stay
I'm prepared for this
I never shoot to miss
But I feel like a storm is coming
If I'm gonna make it through the day
Then there's no more use in runnin'
This is something I gotta face

[Pre-Chorus]
If I risk it all
Could you break my fall?

[Chorus]
How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I wanna feel love run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
For you I have to risk it all
Cause the writing's on the wall

[Verse 2]
A million shards of glass
That haunt me from my past
As the stars begin to gather
And the light begins to fade
When all hope begins to shatter
Know that I won't be afraid

[Pre-Chorus]
If I risk it all
Could you break my fall?

[Chorus]
How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating

137,Anything Goes,"Times have changed
And we've often rewound the clock
Since the Puritans got a shock
When they landed on Plymouth Rock
If today
Any shock they should try to stem
'Stead of landing on Plymouth Rock
Plymouth Rock would land on them

In olden days, a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking
But now, God knows
Anything goes
Good authors, too, who once knew better words
Now only use four-letter words
Writing prose
Anything goes

If driving fast cars you like
If low bars you like
If old hymns you like
If bare limbs you like
If Mae West you like
Or me undressed you like
Why, nobody will oppose
When ev'ry night the set that's smart is
Intruding at nudist parties
In studios
Anything goes

When Missus Ned McLean (God bless her)
Can get Russian reds to ""yes"" her
Then I suppose
Anything goes
When Rockefeller still can hoard en-
-ough money to let Max Gordon
Produce his shows
Anything goes

The world has gone mad today
And good's bad today
And black's white today
And day's night today
And that gent today
You gave a cent today
Once had several chateaus
When folks who still can ride in jitneys
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitneys
Lack baby clothes
Anything goes

When Sam Goldwyn can with great conviction
Instruct Anna Sten in diction
Then 'Nana' shows
Anything goes
When you hear that Lady Mendl standing up
Now turns a handspring landing up-
On her toes
Anything goes

Just think of those shocks you've got
And those knocks you've got
And those blues you've got
From those news you've got
And those pains you've got
(If any brains you've got)
From those little radios
So Missus R., with all her trimmings
Can broadcast abed from Simmons
Cause Franklin knows

It's no secret that lately there ain't no escape
And that I've been waking up alone
Just me and the TV and a sinking feeling
That you ain't ever coming home
But today, the tears ain't gonna hit the floor
Cause the boat's in the bay and it's calling my name
So I'm heading on out the door

Beer's too cold to be thinking bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day

When I turned the ignition I knew I'd been missing
The feel of the wind on my face
I was stuck in a habit of wondering what happened
Two days you're taking all the blame
But a drink or two is a fool proof remedy
It's a beautiful world with a beautiful girl
Kinda making eyes at me

'Cause the sun's too bright, the sky's too blue
Beer's too cold to be thinking bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day

And they're all too high to be bringing them down
If they ask about you, I've got nothing to say
I'll save it for a rainy day

There'll be plenty of time for what ifs and why's
And how'd I let you get away
But the lying in bed all stuck in my head
Is just gonna have to wait

Ungrateful

You should go back to him, perfect match for you, unstable
Doing me dirty (dirty, dirty)

142,Traveller,"[Verse 1]
I see the sunrise creepin' in
Everything changes like the desert wind
Here she comes and then she's gone again, and

[Chorus]
I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I'll just keep rollin' 'til I'm in the dirt
'Cause I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
I couldn't tell you, honey, I don't know
Where I'm goin', but I've got to go
'Cause every turn reveals some other road
And I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller

[Verse 2]
My heartbeat's rhythm is a lonesome sound
Just like the rubber turnin' on the ground
Always lost and nowhere bound

I'll just keep rollin' 'til I'm in the dirt

Where I'm goin', but I've got to go
'Cause every turn reveals some other road

When I'm gone
Somebody else will have to feel this wrong
Somebody else will have to sing this song
Somebody else will have to sing along
Sing along

I'm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heart's behind the pocket of my shirt
I'll just keep rollin' 'til I'm in the dirt
'Cause I'm a traveller, oh, I'm a traveller
I couldn't tell you, honey, I don't know
Where I'm goin', but I've got to go

Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby, they're tumblin' down

146,Thriller,"[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
It's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between your eyes
You're paralyzed

[Chorus 1: Michael Jackson]
'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller
Thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah, ooh

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination
Girl, but all the while
You hear a creature creeping up behind
You're out of time

[Chorus 2: Michael Jackson]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance
Against the thing with 40 eyes, girl

Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller tonight

Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time
They're open wide
This is the end of your life, ooh

They're out to get you
There's demons closing in on every side, ooh
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see

[Chorus 3: Michael Jackson]
That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller, chiller
Thriller here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try

Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller
I'm gonna thrill you tonight

[Outro: Vincent Price & Michael Jackson]
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
(Thriller, ooh, thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
(Thriller night, thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Ooh, babe, I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller night, babe
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of 40 thousand years (Thriller night, thriller)
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller!

Hot on the street like thermometers
You rats will never be honorable
They know I'm a kid of my word
I hustle the first to the first

[Verse 1: Future]
These bitches be naggin' the kid
They get on my motherfucking nerves
I showed up with racks and they love me
I'm smokin' that pack and I'm muddy
Taliban on these hoes
Give a Xan to these hoes
Got em playing with they nose
I sleep on the beach off the avenue
I came to your city with revenue
I put in work, it was evident
I slide on your ass in the 7 deuce
Come back on your bitch in a six trey
Chevy, Mercedes, I keep 'em comin'
Fuck all these bitches, I keep 'em comin'
I pull up right now, I'm parallel
I hit your block with them swangers
My niggas ain't nothin' but some bangers
I sit in the trap with the gangsters
You can't come around here, 'cause it's dangerous
I be hangin' around here and I'm famous
Gotta keep the trigger by my finger
Hit her sideways when I banged her
In the driveway on a perc
I was sideways on a perc
Had a stick on me, that's a first
Got your bitch on me gettin' murked
I post up and that's confident
I boast up in a drop 6
Gotta Ghost Royce and I pop shit
I'm a dope boy with that car, trick
I came in the game I had crack on me
Got Bape on my back with some Act on me
I'm single and shit and she latch on me
I told em' I'm back on my bachelor
I get focused on millions and everything
I just took me a trip out to Africa
See how we came from the mud and the bottom? We did it
I see how they counted us out
Bet they never gonna do it again
You see why these niggas be hatin', ignorin', I'm goin' right in
I was born to get this money in this life of sin
I poured up before they got my dog on murder again
See the fire come out the ass on the Lamborghini
When you say you love a nigga, do you really mean it?
When I was sleepin' on the floor, you should see how they treat me
I pour the Actavis, pop pills so I can fight the demons

[Chorus: Future]
I did the digital dash

These bitches be nagging the kid
Fuck it, it is what it is
If you get hit, you get hit
I don't forget or forgive
Told myself never again, I don't let nobody in
Super just showed out again
And we just keep servin' and servin' again
And again and again and again
I move the game up, I'm reckless
I'm Harlem shaking through the pressure
I might put Diddy on my next shit
I might could fit you in on Wednesday
I'm not here for no pretend shit
Just walked in with a girl that's making triple what I'm making, what a entrance
That's when you know its a body
Zone 6, they know it's a body
Kirkwood, they know it's a body
Lil Mexico know it's a body
Scooter in here with the zombies
Gucci get out, it's a problem
I might take Quentin to Follies
You hate your life, just be honest
I got the digital dash
She want a picture with all of my niggas that just made the visual last
But she too embarrassed to ask
I got my foot on their neck and my foot on the gas
You remind me of a quarterback, that shit is all in the past
Esco and Boomin, they got it on smash
And I got the, I got the, I got the, I got the, I

153,We Went,"Black Pontiac with a pocket of cash
Foot on the gas ready and throwing up a little dust
Like a pickup truck does in the mud
But ain’t nobody slowing us down right now

She said, ""I need a little something with some get up and go
And nobody knows how to get me going quite like you do
When you do the things you do
Wanna give this sleepy podunk town something to talk about""

We were taillights fading from some blue lights chasing
Cut a path through the corn on County Road 44
Tore up a fence, jumped in a ditch, felt so good
We didn’t want it to end so we went

Looking for a dive just to kill some time
Let the heat cool off we could do us some dancing
Didn’t take long, just a couple of songs
You know it’s last call when the law comes walking in

So we were taillights fading from some blue lights chasing
Cut a path through the corn off County Road 44
Tore up a fence, jumped in a ditch, felt so good
We didn’t want it to end so we went

Rocking to the radio, fogging up the windows
Headlights off in a spot nobody else knows

We were taillights fading from some blue lights chasing
Cut a path through the corn on County Road 44
Tore up a fence, jumped in a ditch, felt so good
We didn’t want it to end

Foot on the gas ready and throwing up a little dust

I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop and you don't stop
The rock it to the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

[Verse 1: Wonder Mike]
Now, what you hear is not a test, I'm rapping to the beat
And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet
See I am Wonder Mike and I'd like to say ""hello""
To the black, to the white, the red and the brown, the purple and yellow
But first, I gotta bang bang the boogie to the boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie
Let's rock, you don't stop
Rock the rhythm that'll make your body rock
Well so far you've heard my voice, but I brought two friends along
And next on the mic is my man Hank; come on, Hank, sing that song

[Verse 2: Big Bank Hank]
Check it out, I'm the C-A-S-AN, the O-V-A and the rest is F-L-Y
You see, I go by the code of the doctor of the mix and these reasons I'll tell you why
You see I'm six foot one and I'm tons of fun and I dress to a tee
You see I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali and I dress so viciously
I got bodyguards, I got two big cars, that definitely ain't the whack
I got a Lincoln continental and a sunroof Cadillac
So after school, I take a dip in the pool, which is really on the wall
I got a color TV so I can see the Knicks play basketball
Hear me talking 'bout checkbooks, credit cards, more money than a sucker could ever spend
But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum from the Rucker, not a dime 'til I made it again

[Hook 2: Big Bank Hank]
Everybody go: Hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today (say what?)
Cause I'ma get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go: Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
You see, if your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend

[Post-Hook: Big Bank Hank]
Uh Master Gee, my mellow?
It's on you so what you gonna do?

[Verse 3: Master Gee]
Well it's on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
I said a M-A-S, a T-E-R, a G with a double E
I said I go by the unforgettable name of the man they call the Master Gee
Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls
I'm going down in history
As the baddest rapper there ever could be
Now I'm feeling the highs and you're feeling the lows
The beat starts getting into your toes
You start popping your fingers and stomping your feet
And moving your body while you're sitting in your seat
And then damn, you start doing the freak
I said damn, right outta your seat
Then you throw your hands high in the air
You're rocking to the rhythm, shake your derriere
You're rocking to the beat without a care
With the sure-shot emcees for the affair
Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same
I got a little face and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do ladies is hypnotize
Singing on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singing on and on and on, on and on
Like a hot ready to pop the pop the pop dibbie dibbie
Pop the pop, pop, you don't dare stop
Come alive y'all gimme what you got
I guess by now you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay, I still keep in stride
Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind
Singing on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singing on and on and on, on and on
Rock rock y'all get on the floor

[Hook 3: Master Gee]
I'm gonna freak ya here I'm gonna freak you there
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere

[Post-Hook: Master Gee]
Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind
I'll put t-t-tickets in your behind
I said 1-2-3-4, come on, girls, get on the floor
Uh, come alive, y'all gimme what ya got
Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said 1-2-3-4, tell me Wonder Mike what are you waiting for?

[Verse 4: Wonder Mike]
Skiddlee beebop a we rock a scooby doo
And guess what, America: we love you
Cause ya rock and ya roll with so much soul
You could rock 'til you're a hundred and one years old
I don't mean to brag I don't mean to boast
But we like hot butter on a breakfast toast
Rock it up, uh, baby bubbah
Baby bubbah to the boogie the bang bang the boogie
To the beat beat, it's so unique
Come on, everybody, and dance to the beat

I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop and you don't stop
The rock it to the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

[Verse 5: Wonder Mike]
I said I can't wait 'til the end of the week
When I'm rapping to the rhythm of a groovy beat
An attempt to raise your body heat
Just blow your mind so that you can't speak
To do a thing but a rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called the freak
And when ya finally do come into your rhythmic beat
Rest a little while so ya don't get weak
I know a man named Hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on Hank, uh, sing that song
To the rhythm of the boogie the bang bang the bong

[Verse 6: Big Bank Hank]
Well, I'm Imp the Dimp the ladies pimp
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside, into the front
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker emcees try to prove a point
We're treacherous trio, uh, with a serious joint
A from sun to sun and from day to day
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mic til you can't resist
Everybody, I say it goes like this
Well I was coming home late one dark afternoon
Reporter stopped me for a interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntables
This young reporter I did adore
So I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before
She said ""damn fly guy I'm in love with you""
The Casanova legend must have been true
I said by the way baby what's your name
Said ""I go by the name of Lois Lane""
And you could be my boyfriend you surely can
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman
I said he's a fairy I do suppose
Flying through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy or even cute
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit
I said you need a man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night
But can he rock a party 'til the early light
He can't satisfy you with his little worm
But I can bust you out with my super sperm
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it
An I'm here and I'm there I'm Big Bank Hank, I'm everywhere
Just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it, uh, don't stop y'all, uh, tick a tock y'all you don't stop

[Hook 2: Big Bank Hank]
I go: Hotel, motel, what you gonna do today (say what)
I'm gonna get a fly girl gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go: Hotel, motel, holiday inn
You see, if your girl starts acting up then you take her friend

[Post-Hook: Big Bank Hank]
I say skip, dive, what can I say
I can't fit em all inside my OJ
So I just take half and bust them out
I give the rest to Master Gee so he could shock the house

[Verse 7: Master Gee]
It was 12 o'clock one Friday night
I was rocking to the beat and feeling all right
Everybody was dancing on the floor
Doing all the things they never did before
And then this fly fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar, she came into the scene
As she traveled deeper inside the room
All the fellas checked out her white Sassons
She came up to the table, looked into my eyes
Then she turned around and shook her behind
So I said to myself, its time for me to release
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece
And now people in the house this is just for you
A little rap to make you boogaloo
Now the group ya hear is called Phase Two
And let me tell ya something we're a hell of a crew
Once a week we're on the street
Just a-cutting the jams and making it free
For you to party, got to have the moves
So we'll get right down and give you a groove
For you to dance you got to be hype
So we'll get right down for you tonight
Now the system's on and the girls are there
You definitely have a rocking affair
But let me tell ya something there's still one fact
That to have a party ya got to have a rap
So when the party's over, you're making it home
And trying to sleep before the break of dawn
And while ya sleeping you start to dream
And thinking how ya danced on the disco scene
A name appears in your mind
Yeah, a name you know that was right on time
It was phase two just a doing a do
Rocking ya down cause ya know we could
To the rhythm of the beat that makes ya freak
Come alive girls get on your feet
To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that it makes ya freak
To the rhythm of the beat that says you go on
On and on into the break of dawn
Now I got a man coming on right now
He's guaranteed to throw down
He goes by the name of Wonder Mike
Come on Wonder Mike do what ya like

[Verse 8: Wonder Mike]
Like a can of beer that's sweeter than honey
Like a millionaire that has no money
Like a rainy day that is not wet
Like a gambling fiend that does not bet
Like Dracula without his fangs
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang
Like collard greens that don't taste good
Like a tree that's not made out of wood
Like going up and not coming down
Is just like the beat without the sound, no sound
To the beat beat, ya do the freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat
Have you ever went over a friend's house to eat
And the food just ain't no good
I mean the macaroni's soggy the peas are mushed
And the chicken tastes like wood
So you try to play it off like you think you can
By saying that you're full
And then your friend says ""momma he's just being polite
He ain't finished uh-uh that's bull""
So your heart starts pumping and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says ""man there's plenty of food""
So you pile some more on your plate
While the stinky food's steaming your mind starts to dreaming
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rotting
Into something that looks like cheese
Oh so you say that's it I got to leave this place
I don't care what these people think
I'm just sitting here making myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks
So you bust out the door while its still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of kaopectate
And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says ""I understand about the food
Baby but bubbah we're still friends""

[Hook 1: Wonder Mike]
With a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop and you don't stop
The rock it to the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

[Post-Hook: Wonder Mike]
I say ""Hank can ya rock?
Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?
Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo""
I said ""come on, make uh, make the people move""

[Verse 9: Big Bank Hank]
I go to the halls and then ring the bell
Because I am the man with the clientele
And if ya ask me why I rock so well
I'm Big Bank, I got clientele
And from the time I was only six years old
I never forgot what I was told
It was the best advice that I ever had
It came from my wise dear old dad
He said ""sit down punk I wanna talk to you
And don't say a word until I'm through
Now there's a time to laugh a time to cry
A time to live and a time to die
A time to break and a time to chill
To act civilized or act real ill
But whatever ya do in your lifetime
Ya never let a MC steal your rhyme""
So from six to six 'til this very day
Ill always remember what he had to say
So when the sucker emcees try to chump my style
I let them know that I'm versatile
I got style, finesse and a little black book
That's filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look
But there's a thing that separates you from me
And that is called originality
Because my rhymes are on from what you heard
I didn't even bite and not a godd--m word
And I say a little more later on tonight
So the sucker emcees can bite all night
Uh, tick a tock y'all, a beat, beat y'all
A lets rock y'all, ya don't stop

[Hook 2: Big Bank Hank]
It go: Hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today (say what)
Cause I'ma get a fly girl gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go: Hotel, motel, holiday inn
You see if your girl starts acting up then you take her friends

[Post-Hook: Big Bank Hank]
A like that y'all to the beat y'all
A beat, beat y'all ya don't stop
Uh, Master Gee am I mellow?
Its on you so whatcha gonna do?

[Verse 10: Master Gee]
Well like Johnny Carson on the late show
A like Frankie Crocker in stereo
Well like the  Bar-Kays singing 'Holy Ghost'
The sounds to throw down they're played the most
Just like my man Captain Sky
Whose name he earned with his super sperm
We rock and we don't stop
Get off y'all I'm here to give you whatcha got
To the beat that it makes you freak
And come alive girl, uh, get on your feet
A like a Perry Mason without a case
Like Farrah Fawcett without her face
Like the barkays on the mic
Like getting right down for you tonight
Like moving your body so ya don't know how
Right to the rhythm and throw down
Like coming alive to the Master Gee
The brother who rocks so viciously
I said the age of one my life begun
At the age of two I was doing the do
At the age of three it was you and me
Rocking to the sounds of the Master Gee
At the age of four I was on the floor
Giving all the freaks what they bargained for
At the age of five I didn't take no jive
With the Master Gee its all the way live
At the age of six I was uh, picking up sticks
Rapping to the beat my stick was fixed
At the age of seven I was rocking in heaven
Dontcha know I went off
I got right on down to the beat you see
Getting right on down making all the girls
Just take of their clothes to the beat the beat
To the double beat, beat that makes you freak
At the age of eight I was, uh,  really great
Cause every night you see I had a date
At the age of nine I was, uh, right on time
Cause every night I had a part to rhyme
Going on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
A saying on and on and on, on and on
Like a hot buttered the pop the pop the popcorn
A saying on and on and on on and on
Cause I'm a helluva man when I'm on the mic
I am the definite feast delight
I'm a helluva man when I'm on the mic
I am the definite feast delight
Call me the master gee you see
The brother who rocks so viciously

[Hook 3: Master Gee]

I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere

Talkin' about you be reppin' that Third

Hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight, catch a charge I might
Beat the box up, like Mike in '97, I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no I don't play
""Now eat the cake, Anna Mae!""
Said, ""Eat the cake, Anna Mae!""
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights

157,Used To Love You Sober,"[Verse 1]
Life was great, wouldn't change a thing
I had it all, but with you I had more
But out of nowhere, out of the blue
Our love turned into a war
Now you're gone, you moved on
And I hate the way I'm feeling

[Chorus]
Now the only way I know that I can get you off my mind
To keep a bottle so close, try to leave it all behind
And I couldn't get enough
Girl, I'm drowning, drunk in love
I used to think you'd never say it's over
I used to love you sober
I used to love you sober

[Verse 2]
I'm on the floor, cursing at the door
Broken hearted with a pounding head
And I know, I gotta let you go
So the liquor helps me forget
Your name, your face
This pain I can't erase

[Chorus]
Now the only way I know that I can get you off my mind
To keep a bottle so close, try to leave it all behind
And I couldn't get enough
Girl, I'm drowning, drunk in love
I used to think you'd never say it's over
I used to love you sober
I used to love you sober

[Bridge]
Now you're gone
You moved on
And I hate the way I'm feeling...

[Chorus]
Now the only way I know that I can get you off my mind
To keep a bottle so close, try to leave it all behind
And I couldn't get enough
Girl, I'm drowning, drunk in love
I used to think you'd never say it's over
I used to love you sober
I used to love you sober",Kane Brown,2015,[82],1

If you wanna climb a ladder on a water tower
Then we'll kick it with the stars for a couple hours

If you wanna dip your toes where the water stops
Then we'll let our feet hang off a fishin' dock
If you wanna then we're gonna have to give it a try, that's right

I'm facing the bottle for all of my problems
These Instagram models are nothing but trouble
She's going away now, I'm going full throttle
All these Instagram models, I said they're nothing but trouble

When I met her she was out for love
Yeah, I bought her leather and some diamond studs
Damn, when I met her she was molly'd up
Fuck it, I said ""Whatever"" 'cause I'm not a judge
No, all my niggas say she's not what's up
Uh, I considered it but not enough
Uh, she just wanted to be popular
Uh, she just want ten thousand followers
Lord, she posted, she posted, she posted

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I had to leave that ho alone and get my mind right
I had to go talk to my friends, I had to find Christ
Lord I had to, open up my eyes and find light
I was so green and all she wanted was that limelight
Lord I, was so blinded by her highlights
She had me not checking my DM's neither my likes
Oh what, you modeling ma? Knock yourself out
Open my heart to you when you lock yourself out
When I met her she was posse'd up
In the section holding bottles up
Oh, she just wanted to be popular
Oh, she just want ten thousand followers

[Bridge : Charlie Puth]
I should have known from the very start
That you weren't after my foolish heart
No, you liar, liar, liar girl
You got the world thinking you're a star
But Oh, you're not who you say you are
I'm dying, dying, dying, girl

[Hook: Charlie Puth (Lil Wayne)]
I'm facing the bottle
(I'm sipping and lighted and dipping in line, but I'm coping)
For all of my problems (I'm too open)
These Instagram models (Glad I left her)

Oh, my, my, my, what you do to me?
Like lightning when I'm swimming in the sea
From the very first time we loved
From the very first time we touched
Walking on wires and power lines
You put your body on top of mine
Every time that you lift me up
To the heaven and stars above

Real nigga shit
Other night at your crib, it was like me, Black, 40, OB
We just sittin' there talkin' 'bout life
Played some beats, but I forgot to tell you one thing

[Verse 1: The Game]
Niggas called me to set you up
Want me to come and wet you up
'Cause you a out of town nigga like Biggie
Heard about the shit with Diddy
So I came through to vest you up
And I got a vest for 40, a vest for Hush
A vest for every nigga with an owl on his chest and what
I got L.A. unified
You better off committin' suicide, teachers ain't testin' us
See, I know how it feel to be platinum-plus
Niggas is jealous of you, so they try to wrap you up
Tax you up, but it's OVO/Blood Money
Nigga catch these bullets like he catch the bus
Dawg, fame is a motherfucker
Do a nigga four favors, when you can't do the fifth
How soon they forget?
Run up on you at your granny house, give you nine like Fif'
How are niggas s'posed to love you niggas?
Heart beatin' fast when I dap and when I hug you niggas
Drake told me not to trust you niggas
Your energy off, you're finicky, I rush you niggas
Just walkin' 'round the crib like, ""Why a nigga can't live?
Get this money, fuck these bitches though?""
Thinkin' 'bout the beef like:
""We can pass these mothafuckin' straps like a physical""
This my city, nigga, everybody know it
Ridin' 'round town, just me and my four-pound
Tucked in my Tom Fords, hopin' I ain't gotta show it
L.A. niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit, 40, I'm fucked up

[Chorus: Drake & The Game]
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hunnid
L.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hunnid
L.A., all I ever asked is one hunnid
L.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, one hunnid
All I ever asked is one

[Verse 2: Drake]
Thank me later, thanks for nothin', thanks for bluffin'
Thank you so, so much for wearin' your true colors
To every single fuckin' function
Had niggas tell me to my face how we were family
And how they love me while they were skimmin' off the budget
Now, when I see 'em, they're the ones that's actin' funny
People been reachin' out to me
And I'm on some straight unresponsive shit
I would have so many friends
If I didn't have money, respect and accomplishments
I would have so many friends
If I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments
I would have all of your fans
If I didn't go pop and I stayed on some conscious shit
I would have so many more friends
If I lost my success and my confidence
I'm in the club every time that they play the competition
If they even play the competition and I seen the response they get
Yeah, nobody's even hearin' it, on top of the pyramid
Might go to Jamaica, disappear again
My circle got so small that it's a period, sayin' to myself

Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit

[Verse 3: The Game]
Miss 4 Cent, that was my real nigga
Held a nigga down since he was a lil' nigga
If he was still alive, he would kill niggas
He was Lil' Snupe, I was Meek Mill
Niggas know how it feel when you missin' your nigga though
Can't think, so you roll up that indigo
Stressin' while drivin' down Figuero'
Blowin' kush clouds until his ghost is in my Ghost, damn
Make a real nigga wanna give his life to God like, ""Here it go""
Screamin' Frog name at the clouds, they don't hear me though
Guess they too busy with 2Pac and Biggie though
You niggas don't feel me though
That was on Suge's watch, I'll take Suge's watch
You dissin' Drizzy, that's cool, but don't come to my city though
Not even to H-Town
So underground that I gotta be a trill nigga
Strapped up from the waist down
That's word to Pimp C, J Prince is my real nigga
Shit was so simple when Henchman was out
He had a young nigga right there with Meech
So happy when Bleu Davinci got out
We came up on these California streets
L.A. niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit
Got a nigga confused, but why a nigga gotta choose?
Don't even matter, dawg, cause I'ma always be a real nigga
Always be a real nigga
I never learned how to be nothin' but a real nigga

Money can’t buy happiness

It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down with some silver bullets

But it could buy me a boat

They call me redneck, white trash and blue collar
But I could change all that if I had a couple million dollars

And you can’t fit a camel through the eye of a needle

But it still sounds pretty cool

Then waited all night for the walls to move

Going faster than a million miles an hour

Stuck in motion, and the wheels keep spinning 'round
Moving in reverse with no way out

187,30 For 30 Freestyle,"[Verse]
Never thought I'd be talkin' from this perspective
But, I'm not really sure what else you expected
When the higher-ups have all come together as a collective
With conspiracies to end my run and send me a message
40, did you get the message?
'Cause I just checked my phone and I didn't get it
I mean, I say hats off for a solid effort
But we didn't flinch for a second, we got our shit together
Yeah, not here to fight wars
But niggas wanna talk high scores
PARTY just dipped off in a white Porsche
And I just came from dinner where I ate some well-done seared scallops that were to die for
But, I got bigger fish to fry
I'm talkin' bigger shit than you and I
Kids are losin' lives, got me scared of losin' mine
And if I hold my tongue about it, I get crucified
Wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night
Flyin' over Chattanooga
Out here tryna spread the movement
I just got me the Mercedes Pullman
You niggas never heard of it, you gotta hit up Google
Back in the city, shit is gettin' brutal
These kids'll hit your noodle then take a girl to the movies
They've been droppin' out on both sides
We ain't in it, we just ghost ride
The pen is workin' if you niggas need some ghost lines
I thought you wanted yours like I want mine
I guess you just makin' moves on your own time
But just know it'll be January in no time
And your absence is very concernin'
It's like you went on vacation with no plan of returnin'
Shit is purely for sport, I need a 30 for 30
Banners are ready in case we need to retire your jersey
I got a club in the Raptors arena
Championships, celebrations durin' regular seasons
Paternity testin' for women that I never slept with
I'm legally obligated if they request it
So much legal action like I'm Michael Jackson
Luckily, I'm great at avoidin' distraction
Used to give no reaction, now I'm overreacting
Ahh nigga, that shit gotta go platinum
I just listened to Closer to My Dreams
Wide eyed and uneducated at 19
I can't rap like that, all young and naive
Not after all of the shit I've seen and the things I believe
Drastically changin', thank you for all your patience
I'm just in a different space and I choose to embrace it
4,000 square feet just isn't as spacious
You loved me back in the basement
Guess it is what we make it
I'm tired of awkward exchanges and niggas' crooked ways
Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away
Peyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother
The season start and I don't wanna
See you end up with nothin'
Y'all throw the word ""family"" around too much in discussion
Rookie season, I would've never thought this was comin'
They knees give out and they passing to you all of a sudden
Now you the one gettin' buckets
They put their arm around you
Now you becomin' the crutches
Kids got on your number cause you the one they look up to
And women that you seen on TV look better in person
And either they wanna fuck you or convince you
That they care to see where it goes from there
But these ain't the girls from Brampton
This ain't that local action
The haters just bringin' me and my people closer, actually
What happened to the things
You niggas said was supposed to happen?
Are we just supposed to
Ignore the fact that it never happened?
We just supposed to get the pie and then split it in two?
Supposed to forget your mistakes, but not forget about you?
My plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf
And treat the money like secrets, keep that shit to ourselves
Papi champú, young pablito de seis dios
6 G-O-D, I think I was destined for this shit
When I was 'round Keyshia Cole and T.I
And Young Dro was poppin' off with ""Ain't I""
Way before niggas had they hands out
Like they doin' macarena
But, who am I to complain now, I'm still around, they know",Drake,2015,"[92, 88]",2

All week long it’s a farmin’ town
They’re makin’ that money grow

Bar downtown they got a line
Of people way out the door
$10 dollar drinks, it’s packed inside

And it’s like knock, knock, knock goes the diesel
If you really wanna see the beautiful people

Reaping everything I sow, so my karma come in heaven
No preliminary hearings on my record

Digging in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Every day my logic get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... Ah!

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & Thundercat]
I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid of a lot of changes
I'm alright, and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers

[Poem: Kendrick Lamar]
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers",Kendrick Lamar,2015,"[98, 81, 82, 84, 89, 94, 89, 92, 94, 90, 88, 86, 82, 83]",14

Yeah, views, views, views
Yeah, yeah, alright

[Verse 1: Drake]
Old ways, new women, gotta keep a balance
The girl of your dreams to me is probably not a challenge
I've been counted out so many times, I couldn't count it
Funny how now my accountant is havin' trouble tryna count it
To the people that think that I owe you shit
Payback's a bitch and you know that shit
Y'all niggas gettin' too old for this
Please don't think nobody notices
I've been up for way too many days
Y'all sleep enough for me anyway
Y'all don't be doin' shit anyway
Y'all are not true to this anyway
OVO, East End, Reps Up, we might just get hit with the R.I.C.O
Everyone home for the summer, so let's not do nothing illegal
I go make 50 million then I give some millions to my people
They gon' go Tony Montana and cop them some Shaq at the free throws
But they're from the way fam, there's not much to say fam
They told me to tell you you mans are some wastemans
And stay in your place fam
My dad is from Memphis, and I am the king
I should probably just move into Graceland
Madonna’s a ting I know and I’m the king of pop
I’m building Never-Never Land
How he hate me when I never met the man, woo!

[Refrain: Drake]
We might just get hit with the R.I.C.O

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Meek Milly!
'Cause we in the field with them birds like we play for the Eagles
I'm on probation so let me not talk what's illegal (Switch it up)
Today I woke up with my dream girl, she rich as a Beatle
For my teachers that said I wouldn't make it here
I spend a day what you make a year
I had to drop this to make it clear
That I got it locked like Jamaican hair
All theses choppers poppin', niggas wildin', violence
Why we even got to take it here?
Why we even got to play these games?
Run up on me, catch a facial there
It's the Chasers, what you thought?
I come through my block like I'm Rico
Poppin' a wheelie, no squealie, can't talk to the cops, that's illegal
I was like more a Rich Porter, no double-crossing on my peoples
I take an M to the table and split it with my niggas equal
I'm back on that hood shit, yeah that wish you would shit
I'm talking that cross you that fade you fourth quarter
Like Jordan, we back on that bullshit
We came up from nothing
We started on list's most wanted but now it's the Forbes list
We really was doing shit
I can hear echoes from feds on this beat from informants
I think they recording
Shhh, listen, you hear that?

We are not the same, I am too reckless
I'm not tryna go in that direction
These niggas, they been doin' too much flexin'
And they about to call the wrong attention
And I don't got no patience, no more testin'
I do shit how I want, don't need no blessin'
XO niggas ain't nothin' to mess with
Nobody stoppin' us, oh no, we destined
And everybody 'round you is so basic
I'm never rockin' white, I'm like a racist
I don't drink my liquor with a chase in
That money is the only thing I'm chasin'

Do an ounce, get some dick, tell her friends about it

Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)

Last year I did all the politickin'
This year I'ma focus on the vision
I think these hoes deserve another fixin'
I'm talkin' 'bout the ones from the beginnin'
Don't believe the rumors, bitch, I'm still a user
I'm still rockin' camo and still roll with shooters
I'm a villain in my city, I just made another killin'
I'ma spend it all on bitches
And everybody fuckin', everybody fuckin'
Pussy on the house, everybody fuckin'
Man, I miss my city, man, it's been a minute

Cruise through the west-end in my new Benz
I'm just tryna live life through a new lens
Drivin' by the streets I used to walk through
When I had no crib, I guess you call that shit a miracle

Used to roam on Queen, now I sing Queen Street anthems
Used to hate attention, now I pull up in that wagon

I used to roam around the town when I was homeless
Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix

205,Loving You Easy,"[Verse 1]
Every morning when you come downstairs
Hair's a mess but I don't care
No makeup on and shining so bright
My old sweatshirt never fit so right
Dancing around to the radio
Humming the words that you don't know
Cross off finding an angel off my list
Thinking that it don't get no better than this

You make loving you all I wanna do
Every little smile and every single touch
Reminds me just how much it all makes

In my dark times taking it back to the street
Making those promises that I could not keep
In my dark times, baby this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me

[Intro: Big Sean]
They used to tell me, used to tell me

[Hook: Big Sean]
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls that's pretty at everything
Million dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all, just remember one thing
Remember one thing, that one man could change the world
That one man could change the world

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
All I, all I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad chick
Imagined this so much, some nights it felt like that I had it
Back on the mattress, starin' at the ceilin' tryna connect the dots
But it's hard makin' those attachments
I'm talkin' dreamin' so hard, some nights it felt like draft day
You know? My - my step brother used to flip them bags
Outside the crib like it was trash day
No Kim K, but he bagged yay (Ye)
But when you're gettin' fast money, slow down, don't crash
With all the drive in the world, swear you still need gas
Look, think about it, close your eyes, dream about it
Tell your team about it, go make million dollar schemes about it
Success is on the way, I feel it in the distance
Used to look up at the stars
And be like, ""Ain't too much that's different""
I be shinin', they be shinin', get your one shot, don't you miss it
What you know bout' wakin' up every day like you on a mission?

[Hook: Kanye West]
And I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything
Million dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all, just remember one thing
Remember one thing, one man could change the world
One man could change the world

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
My grandma told me, ""If you write your name in stone
You'll never get the white out""
I grinded out that black hole then performed up at the White House
Standin' next to Jim Carrey, we traded stories, then laughed
I said you not the only one I know got rich wearin' masks
Where I'm from, I swear they broke
They need way more than the cast
We need more than what you have
And then we need more than that
But how am I supposed to say I'm tired
If that girl from West Virginia came up in conditions
That I couldn't survive?
Went to war, came back alive
On top of that became a female black captain
When being black, you had to extra-extra try
Way before James Brown made us proud
She bought a crib on the same street as Marvin Gaye
Right there on Outer Drive, and she taught me how to drive
And she raised the kids, then the kids' kids, and she did it right
Taught me how to love, taught me not to cry
When I die, I hope you teach me how to fly
All my life you've been that angel in disguise, sayin'...

[Hook: John Legend]
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything
Million dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all, just remember one thing
Remember one thing, that one man can change the world
That one man can change the world

216,The Night Is Still Young,"[Verse 1]
Yo, ayo tonight is the night that I'ma get twisted
Myx Moscato and vodka, I'ma mix it
Roll that spaceship, we ‘bout to get lifted
Live in the present, that gift is for the gifted
This what you came, this what you came for
You get what you buy, this what you paid for
So make sure the stars is what you aim for
Make mistakes though

Tell the bartender, say my order back (Ay!)
It's bottle service, he ordered that (Ay!)
Might let him take it home and slaughter that
He got friends for all of my friends
They ain't leaving 'till we say when
And we gon' hangover the next day
But we will remember this day
So drop the pop and get low
Or we can drop the top and just cruise
We fresh to death, down to the shoes
My only motto in life is don't lose

I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me

I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine and I'm finna let it shine
I'm finna take y'all back to them better times
I'm finna talk about my mama if y'all don't mind
I was three years old when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that, mommy, can't you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
'Cause a nigga cheatin', telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy I'ma love you 'til you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'ma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford
See you're unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that's makin' loot
A livin' legend too, just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel, and I thank you (Hey Mama)

I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you

Forrest Gump mama said, ""Life is like a box of chocolates""
My mama told me go to school, get your doctorate
Somethin to fall back on, you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you
You was getting through, can the choir, please
Give me a verse of ""You Are So Beautiful To Me""
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou, Nikki Giovanni, turn one page and there's my mommy
Come on mommy just dance wit' me, let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say Hey, y'all say, Mama, now everybody answer me (Hey Mama)

Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out
To a restaurant, upper echelon
I'ma get you a Jag, whatever else you want

Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Somebody
Told me that this planet was small, we used to live in
The same building, on the same floor, and never met before
Until I'm overseas on tour, and peeped this Ethiopian
Queen from Philly taking classes abroad
She studying film and photo, flash, focus, record
Said she working on a flick and could my clique do the score
She said she loved my show in Paris at Elysee Montmartre
And that I stepped off the stage and took a piece of her heart
We knew from the start that things fall apart and tend to shatter
She like, ""That shit don't matter."" When I get home, get at her
Through letter, phone, whatever; let's link, let's get together
Shit, you think not, think the Thought went home and forgot?
Time passed, we back in Philly, now she up in my spot
Telling me the things I'm telling her is making her hot
Starting building with her constantly round-the-clock
Now she in my world like hip-hop, and keep telling me…

[Chorus: Erykah Badu]
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or

Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me

[Verse 2: Black Thought + Eve]
Yo, I'm the type that's always catching a flight
And sometimes I gotta be out at the height of the night
And that's when she flip and get on some old…  another lonely night
Seem like I'm on the side, you only loving your mic
I know you gotta get that paper, daddy, keep that shit tight
But, yo, I need some sort of love in my life, you dig me?
While politicking with my sister from New York City
She said she know this ball player and he think I'm pretty—psych
I'm playin', boo, you know it's just with you I'm staying, boo
And when cats be poppin' game, I don't hear what they sayin', boo
When you out there in the world, I'm still your girl
With all my classes I don't have the time for life's thrills
So when you sweating on stage, think of me when you rhyme
And don't be listening to your homies, they be leadin' you blind
Yeah, so what you saying, I can trust you? Is you crazy?! You my king for real
But sometimes relationships get ill, no doubt

If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies

Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
That snake could be that chick and that rat could be that cool cat
That's whispering, ""She trying to play you for the fool, Black.""
If something's on your chest, then let it be known
See, I'm not your every five minutes all on the phone
And on the topic of trust, it's just a matter of fact
That people bite back and fracture what's intact
And they'll forever be, I ain't on some ""Oh, I'm a celebrity!""
I deal with the real, so if it's artificial, let it be
I've seen people caught in love like whirlwinds
Listening to their squads and listening to girlfriends
That's exactly the point where their whole world ends
Lies come in, that's where that drama begins, and she like…

220,Young & Crazy,"One day, I'll slow and lay down
Spend my weekends in a swing out on the wraparound
Oh but these days, I'm on a mission
To get these wild oats out of my system
Yeah, I might stay out all night

I wanna sit out on the porch
Telling stories 'bout my glory days when I'm pushing eighty
How am I ever gonna get to be old and wise
If I ain't ever young and crazy?

Now, I might have to kiss no telling how many lips
Before I ever really figure out what love is
Go through some heartbreaks, wake up with headaches
Don't learn nothing 'til you make a lot of mistakes
How will I know where to draw the line
If I don't cross it a few hundred times?

I wanna sit out on the porch
Telling stories 'bout my glory days when I'm pushing eighty
How am I ever gonna get to be old and wise
If I ain't ever young and crazy?

Yeah, I'm gonna stay out all night
I've gotta do a little wrong so I know what's right
I've gotta live a lot of life if I'm gonna give good advice
When I'm talking to my grand-babies
How am I ever gonna get to be old and wise
If I ain't ever young and crazy?

Straight outta Compton!
Crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube
From the gang called Niggas Wit Attitudes
When I'm called off, I got a sawed-off
Squeeze the trigger and bodies are hauled off
You too, boy, if you fuck with me
The police are gonna have to come and get me
Off your ass, that's how I'm going out
For the punk motherfuckers that's showing out
Niggas start to mumble, they wanna rumble
Mix 'em and cook 'em in a pot, like gumbo
Going off on the motherfucker like that
With a gat that's pointed at your ass
So give it up smooth
Ain't no telling when I'm down for a jack move
Here's a murder rap to keep y'all dancin'
With a crime record like Charles Manson
AK-47 is the tool
Don't make me act a motherfucking fool
Me you can go toe to toe, no maybe
I'm knocking niggas out the box, daily
Yo, weekly, monthly and yearly
Until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly
That I'm down with the capital C-P-T
Boy, you can't fuck with me
So when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck
‘Cause Ice Cube is crazy as fuck
As I leave, believe I'm stompin'
But when I come back boy, I'm coming straight outta Compton

More punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger
I'm a bad motherfucker, and you know this
But the pussy-ass niggas won't show this
But I don't give a fuck, I'ma make my snaps
If not from the records, from jacking or craps
Just like burglary, the definition is jacking
And when I'm legally armed it's called packing
Shoot a motherfucker in a minute
I find a good piece of pussy and go up in it
So if you're at a show in the front row
I'ma call you a bitch or dirty-ass ho
You'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to
But that shows me, slut, you're not opposed to
A crazy motherfucker from the street
Attitude legit, ‘cause I'm tearing up shit
MC Ren controls the automatic
For any dumb motherfucker that starts static
Not the right hand, ‘cause I'm the hand itself
Every time I pull an AK off the shelf
The security is maximum, and that's a law
R-E-N spells Ren, but I'm raw
See, ‘cause I'm the motherfucking villain
The definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin'
That's taking place without a clue
And once you're on the scope, your ass is through
Look, you might take it as a trip
But a nigga like Ren is on a gangsta tip

[Verse 3: Eazy E]
Straight outta Compton
Is a brother that'll smother your mother
And make your sister think I love her
Dangerous motherfucker raising hell
And if I ever get caught, I make bail
See, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem
I see a motherfucking cop, I don't dodge him
But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while
And when I see a punk pass, I smile
To me it's kinda funny, the attitude showing a nigga driving
But don't know where the fuck he's going, just rolling
Looking for the one they call Eazy
But here's a flash, they'll never seize me
Ruthless, never seen, like a shadow in the dark
Except when I unload
You see a spark and jump over hesitation
And hear the scream of the one who got the lead penetration
Feel a little gust of wind and I'm jetting
But leave a memory no one'll be forgetting
So what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her!
You think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't a sucker
This is an autobiography of the E
And if you ever fuck with me
You'll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother
Word to the motherfucker, straight outta Compton
(Compton Compton Compton)
(Straight outta Compton)

226,Boyz-N-The Hood,"[Verse 1]
Cruisin' down the street in my 6-4
Jockin' the freaks, clockin' the dough
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckle-heads out there cold-shootin' some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rollin' Kilo G
He rolled down his window and he started to say
It's all about makin' that GTA

[Hook]
'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' the trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

[Scratches]
Yo, man!
Get the fuck out!
Pump that bass!
Mothafucker, say what?

[Verse 2]
Donald B's in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JD is on freebase
The boy JD was a friend of mine
'Til I caught him in my car tryin' to steal an Alpine
Chased him up the streets to call a truce
The silly cluckhead pulls out a deuce deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12-gauge
One sucka dead, LA Times front page

[Hook]
'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' the trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

[Scratches]
Yo, Leroy!
Beer drinkin', breath stinkin', sniffin' glue

[Verse 3]
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a place where my homeboys chill
The fellas out there makin' that dollar
I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I started drinkin'
And from the 8-ball my breath started stinkin'
Left to get my girl to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb ho said somethin' that made me mad
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy-ass weave
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp, slapped the ho
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a right cross, cold-knocked him out

[Hook]
'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' the trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

[Scratches]
Who do you think you are, Mr. big stuff?
Rock this mothafucker like Three the Hard Way

[Verse 4]
I'm rollin' hard, now I'm under control
Then wrapped my 6-4 around a telephone pole
I looked at my car and I said ""Oh, brother.""
I throw it in the gutter, and go buy another
Walkin' home, I see the G ride
Now Cat is drivin', Kilo on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Cat got beat for resistin' arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin' his Guess
Now G is caught for doin' the crime
Fourth offense on the boy he'll do some time

[Hook]
'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' the trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

L.A. playa
Big Drum Beater

[Verse 5]
I went to get them out, but there was no bail
The fellas causin' a riot in the county jail
Two days later in the municipal court
Kilo G on trial cold cut a fart
""Disruption of the court,"" said the judge
On a six-year sentence, my man didn't budge
Baliff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out ""Fire!"", then came Suzy
The bitch came in with a sub-machine Uzi
Police shot the girl but didn't hurt her
Both upstate for attempted murder

228,Sangria,"[Текст песни «Sangria» ft. Markul]

[Припев: Thomas Mraz]
Ты холодна, как сангрия
Столько бокалов, но льешь все мимо
Ты просто ждешь здесь своего милого
Не дай им выжать из себя лимонад
Сука холодна, как сангрия
Сука холодна, как сангрия

[Куплет 1: Thomas Mraz]
Деве нужен камуфляж в этом хищном мире
Чтобы защитить то, что она хранит здесь
Меж висками пробегает ток
Она испускает аромат, сок
Где же он тот, кто выжимал её
Фруктами, цветами засыпал её
Детка прибавляет к себе лед
Ее слезы горькие, как мед
Где же его полу-автомат, что положит всех подонков в ряд
Все ее подруги - дешевое пойло
Без капли натуры, но всегда довольны
Сытые и пьяны, синяки на теле
На них больше мяты
Но скоро похмелье

[Припев: Thomas Mraz]
Ты холодна, как сангрия
Столько бокалов, но льешь все мимо
Ты просто ждешь здесь своего милого
Не дай им выжать из себя лимонад
Сука холодна, как сангрия
Сука холодна, как сангрия

[Куплет 2: MARKUL]
С каждым бокалом тебя меньше и меньше
Сколько языков там побывало в эти выходные?
Времени мало, будет меньше и меньше
И я слишком долго отхожу от встреч с тобой, прости, я должен
Отложить тебя пока что в долгий ящик
Думать о не настоящем в настоящем
Ведь когда мы с тобой всю ночь
Меня трясёт на утро но я продолжаю дальше (пить тебя)
Одним даришь тепло, другим даёшь надежду
Но каждый твой глоток так не похож на прежний
Мы так давно знакомы но ничто не вечно
Сладость заменила горечь и её разбавить нечем

Them jeans are faded
In all the right places
You got me hanging on tight to your curves like little E races
Girl your funky little back beat has got me
Feel like I’m tipsy
And I ain’t even had a drink

[Chorus]
I wanna kiss you in the parking lot
Under the moonlight
Kiss you running red lights
Baby set the mood right
Just like everything you’re doing to me right now's
Making me crazy
I wanna kiss you on the dance floor
Kiss you like a lets go, come on
Baby let me hear you say oh, oh
I wanna kiss you with the neon lights in your eyes glowing
Then I wanna kiss you in the morning
Yeah I wanna kiss you in the morning

[Verse 2]
Oh you little outlaw
Stealing my heart and all
When you drop it down low
Touch your toes girl
You know you just show it off
That little tattoo on your tan line, oh my
Pretty little butterfly
What else have you got to hide?

[Chorus] x2
I wanna kiss you in the parking lot
Under the moonlight
Kiss you running red lights
Baby set the mood right
Just like everything you’re doing to me right now's
Making me crazy

Kiss you like a lets go, come on

230,One Hell Of An Amen,"[Verse 1]
Preacher said he died too young
Over there toting that gun
For Uncle Sam and our freedom
Mom and Daddy dressed in black
They folded up that flag
Handed it to dad
And started praying
Yeah he went out 21 guns blazing

[Chorus]
And that's One Hell of an Amen
That's the only way to go
Fighting the good fight
Till the good Lord calls you home
And so be well, my friend
Until I see you again
This is our last goodbye
But it's a Hell of an Amen

Doctor said he ain't got long
He just smiled said bring it on
If you think I'm scared
You got it all wrong
A little cancer can't break me
My heart's right and I believe
We all hit our knees
Started praying
No, he never gave up
Said the Good Lord's waiting

And that's One Hell of an Amen

Where there’s a do not touch, my finger print done stained it
Where there’s a train wreck, sit on back and watch me crash
Where there’s a what, you say, damn right I said it

No, they don’t make guys like me, you get exactly what you see

So, take your pistol pointing finger right off of the trigger

For breaking your heart, taking this living a little too hard
Drinking too much and playing too loud, where there’s a scar I carved it out

No, they don’t make guys like me, you get exactly what you see

So, take your pistol pointing finger right off of the trigger

[Intro]
Cole, Cole world, yeah
Let me take y'all back, man
As I do so well
Wasn't nothin' like that

[Verse 1]
Man, it wasn't nothin' like that first time, she was in my math class
Long hair, brown skin with a fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it
I was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school
‘Cause when I seen them thighs on her
And them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreamin', man, what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up
As time goes by, attractions gettin' deep and
Wet dreamin', thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin'
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said, ""You ever had sex before?""
Damn…

[Chorus]
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 2]
I wrote back and said
""Of course I had sex before,"" knowin' I was frontin'
I said, ""I'm like a pro, baby,"" knowin' I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth, I knew that I'd get played out, son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one
But she don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me
""Oh, you a pro, homie? Well, I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'.""
That's when my heart start racin' and my body start sweatin'
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you layin' on the bed
Teacher, please, don't make me stand up
I wrote back like, ""Yeah, baby, sound like a plan.""
Still tryna play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death, my nigga, my stomach turnin'
Talkin' shit, knowin' damn well I was a virgin
Fuck…

[Chorus]
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 3]
You know that feelin' when you know
You finna bone for the first time?
I'm hopin' that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hopin' that my shit is big enough to fuck with
And most of all I'm prayin', ""God, don't let me bust quick!""
I'm watchin' pornos, tryna see just how to stroke right
Practice puttin' condoms on—how it go, right?
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palms sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touchin'
And her face start blushin' and a nigga roll over on top
And then she get my pants unbuckled
And her hands start rubbin' on me, ooh girl, don't stop
It's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it
And said, ""I wanna get somethin' off my mental
I can tell you're a pro, but baby, be gentle, ‘cause—""

Sitting back behind that moon
It goes perfect with your eyes

It's something about the way you're smiling
Making the stars fall right on queue

Tonight looks good on you

Makes me just wanna lean in for another kiss
Wind blowing your hair around
Girl, it makes me want to lay you down

Somethin' about that southern sky

Looks so good on your skin
I don't ever, no, I never
I don't ever, ever want to end, baby

Tonight looks good on you
I just gotta tell you, baby

You look good at party

Give me a second I, I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom
Getting higher than the Empire State
My lover, she's waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking 'bout a scar
And I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget it
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies
You know, I'm trying hard to take it back
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home

We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter

Now I know that I'm not
All that you got

Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
But our friends are back
So let's raise the cup
'Cause I found someone to carry me home

I'm on my grind, 3 AM text like I need ya
Dream about the pussy, fuck it, I'm a dreamer
Hold me down but don't hold me back like I need you to, damn
I wrote myself a million dollar check in fifth grade
I put it on the wall and promised it'd be this way
She fuck me like she want the rent paid
Like she want that Oscar De La Renta
I slow it down like it's her favorite ballad
Then go back up at it like I hadn't had it

I gave her the dick but I'm not in love
I call out, ""Bingo!"" the minute I'm bonin'
Soon as I'm done, kick her out in the mornin'
Got Xans when I turn up, it's a party, bust it open
Pop that pussy in a circle, go retarded, pop it for me
She got that booty galore, grippin' it, backin' me up
You wanna fuck with a thug
Now I see all these bitches got ass and they throwin'
Damn, it's just a matter of time 'fore I'm gone
Drinkin' Ciroc and I know that she got it for free
I hit up Diddy, he told me he did it
He said that the liquor just bring out the freaks

I'd like for you to take this time
And remember where you was
The first time you heard Dedication
If I asked you how many times you've listened to D2
Could you tell me?
Dedication 3 was the first mixtape you heard
When we had a black president
D4 and 5, we got back to business
Y'all done copied the rhymes
Y'all done stole the artwork
Tried to emulate my shit-talkin'
Weezy and Dram' — we are the Mixtape Blueprint
Hahaha! You welcome

I smoke doobies, don't smoke J's
Don't watch movies, don't go to plays
I watch cuties, porn, and play
I got Uzis on the way
I don't be choosey, I don't be safe
I don't get woozy, I get the waist
My bitch ballin' like Sinead, Erykah Badu with the fade
Capital-WNBA, I just teach her how to save
I been sleepin' with my AK, with my finger around her waist
I been dreamin' I caught a body —
That's some sweet dreams, who want a taste?
Give the American dream to a bitch that ain't even from the USA
That's the land of the Free, it's the home of AJ
Got a whole brick of some yay, I put one line on the plate
She's gon' take it to the face, like ""Thin line between love and hate""
I got Dealers 'N' Associates, call that my DNA
All these diamonds, all this gold and shit, call that PB&J
I got Bloods in LA, I got Bloods down in the A
I got Bloods everywhere you lay but ain't no blood in my filet
Hit the court, shoot the DA, treat beef like USDA
OMW to your trap, (Blap!) — Now I'll be On My Way
I got plugs I ain't got to pay, I got shit I ain't got to say
I got cribs way out of state, I ain't got no more pocket space
Sippin' slo-mo at my pace, lean like I wear a brace

Thought about your coffin and started barfin'
Thought about your orphans, how they probably starvin'
Thought about this artful shit, how I'm so thoughtful
Walkin' on the marble, feelin' like Ricardo
Walkin' 'round like the campus of Harvard
Shoutout my nigga Swizz, niggas gettin' smarter
Try to hit the books, and nigga hit the target
Sittin' on the charter, talkin' 'bout the targets
Waitin' on departure, waitin' on a sculpture
Make sure my vultures keep an extra cartridge
And make sure my Barbies keep an extra Barbie
My dick is her electric chair, feel the voltage
And her pussy better smell like a orchid
Wetter than a wishin' well, need a quarter
Damn, I wish I was a lil bit taller
Damn, I wish I drank a lil more water
Damn, my weed stank a lil more harder
Damn, I pull up with a redbone, scarlet
With a yellowbone car
That smoke green, that's Marley
Purple and the orange, you seen, that's horror
No Eve in my garden, F-R-uh, F-R-uh
All the Gs in my corner, them boys so warriors
Believe we deserve every leaf in the forest
Kis and quarters layin' around my headquarters
Borderline hoarder, you a mortal, I report her
World on my shoulders but it's lighter than a clover
I'm your bitch, baby, hold me tighter than a stroller
System so solar, got white like Crayola
Nut like granola all in your bitch rollers
You never been in jail, I never been in a Corolla
Then I roll a blunt 'bout as thick as a Samoan
This is that six shit, the sickness is showin'
The sickness is spreadin', the disease is growin'
The bitches is hoein', the witnesses knowin'
The dollars are torn, they're fishin' for coins
I continue goin', I get to the boar and
I rip off his horns, six in the mornin'
Then I just yawn and forget to mourn and
Give to the star, it's 6, the reward",Lil Wayne,2015,[100],1

I couldn't just walk by
And not say hi
And I know your name
'Cause everybody in here knows your name
And you're not looking for anything right now

I don't know you but I want to

I don't wanna change your mind

I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time

And I know it starts with hello
And the next thing you know you're try to be nice
And some guys getting too close
Trying to pick you up
Trying to get you drunk
And I'm sure one of your friends is about to come over here
Cause she's supposed to save you from random guys
That talk too much and wanna stay too long
It's the same old song and dance but I think you know it well
You could've rolled your eyes
Told me to go to hell
Could've walked away
But you're still here
And I'm still here
Come on let's see where it goes

I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind

Slow motion for me, slow motion for me

[Verse 1: Soulja Slim]
I'm a dick thrower, her neck and her back hurting
Cut throater, have you like a brand new virgin
It's like when you get used of it then you start serving
Hop up on top and start jicky-jicky-jerking
Slow down for me, a-you moving too fast
My fingers keep slipping, I'm tryna grip that ass
Keep being hard-headed and I'ma make you get on me
Got human enough disguise but my face is a doggy
If you loving my bark let me bury my bone
I got four or five bad married bitches at home
One of my bitches feel in love with that outside dick
That outside dick keep them hoes sick like

[Chorus: Soulja Slim]
Ughh! I like it like that
She working that back, I don't know how to act
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me

Slow motion for me, slow motion for me
Slow motion for me, move in slow motion for me

[Verse 2: Juvenile]
It's like I got the world in my palms
Your girl up under my arms, she fucked up from the charm
She love the way the dick stay hard from 12 'til early in the morn'
Fine bitches if you listening, you heard me, I'm strong
If you going through your cycle, I ain't with it, I'm gone
You must have heard about them hoes that I beat up in my home
They wasn't telling the truth baby, you know they was wrong
Now, make it official, wind up some of that dome
I don't mind buying blue, your riding to
Don't be asking nigga questions about where I'm driving you
Lil mama my shit together, I ain't jiving you
I don't think that nigga could do you better then I could do, ya know
And Juvenile from cross the street by the derby
Same nigga that used to be running with Rusty and Kirby
Can a playa from the 'Nolia get a chance with it?
But I can't bounce with you without using my hands with it

[Chorus: Soulja Slim]
Ughh! I like it like that
She working that back, I don't know how to act
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me
Slow motion for me, move in slow motion for me
Ughh! I like it like that
She working that back, I don't know how to act
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me
Slow motion for me, move in slow motion for me

[Verse 3: Soulja Slim]
Slow motion, she open, I'm hoping she don't leave my dick broken
With brush burns and swollen
I'm toting, she wanted me to make her out a believer
I gurantee ya I'ma see ya when I see ya
And just don't holla out my name like we was all that
Your pussy throw back and you know that
So stop stunting, slow motion for a real nigga
I'm going off that incredible potion and I'ma deal with ya

[Verse 4: Juvenile]
I like how that Victoria Secret sit in that ass
Let me pour some more hip and Hennsey in your glass
Would I be violating if I grab me a handful?
I know what's happening, all I want is a sample
Who you with? I'm in the rental today
It's going down and happening and I remember the way
Less money we spend on bullshit, the more for the weed
What's it gonna take for you to come slow motion with me?
Like

246,Charged Up,"[Intro]
Stop, stop, stop…
Fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas
That’s why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up
I’m so sorry
Did you hope I was crying?
It was rough without you
It was rough without you

[Hook]
I did some charity today for the kids
But I'm used to it 'cause all y'all charity cases
All y’all stare in my face in hopes you could be the replacement
Niggas is snitchin' on us without no interrogation
I stay silent 'cause we at war and I’m very patient
Six God is watchin', I just hope you’re prepared to face him
I’m charged up, I’m charged up

[Verse 1]
Wow, I’m honored that you think this is staged
I’m flattered, man, in fact I’m amazed
The perfect start to the summer, man, this shit is a doozy
This shit a twist in the movie, but don't jump to conclusions
You boys are gettin' into your feelings on me
You should embrace it, this could be one of our realest moments
Okay, the flow start to feel familiar, don’t it?
Must I remind you that Jimmy got 20 million on it?
Need DJ Clue to drop a bomb on it
None of them want this shit more than I want it
I seen it all comin', knew they would push a button
East egg huntin', they gotta look for somethin'
Done doin' favors for people
'Cause it ain’t like I need the money I make off a feature
I see you niggas havin' trouble goin' gold
Turnin' into some so and so’s that no one knows
But so it go
Come live all your dreams out at OVO
We gon' make sure you get your bread and you know the ropes
I get a ring and I bring it home like I’m Cory Joe
No woman ever had me star struck
Or was able to tell me to get my bars up
I’m charged up
Oh no we eatin', niggas ain’t about to starve us
Nah, niggas ain't about to starve us
I'm charged up

[Verse 2]
I bought my niggas rollies off of Thank Me Later
While these boys was stanky leggin'
Trust me this information is vital
I’m tryin' to take the high road
I still got love for my idols
I got me a deal with Apple and I still feel entitled
Rumor has it, there’s somethin' that only I know
Rumor has it, I steer the ship with my eyes closed
Rumor has it, I either fucked her or never could
But rumor has it, hasn’t done you niggas any good
It’s sound, sound, sound ‘til the day I die
We goin' live to keep this shit alive
Cops are killin' people with they arms up
And your main focus is tryna harm us?
And you think you ‘bout to starve us?
Niggas ain’t about to starve us
Nah, I’m charged up!

[Outro]
(Stop, stop, stop, stop…)
Have you seen me?
I’m doing so good
Every time we meet:
""Oh, I’m so sorry.""

That’s why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up)

[Sample]
""You know, I kept it real
It ain’t too many real people out here
And people be on some weak bitch-ass shit all day long
Industry people… regular people…
And then when you keep it real with people, they cross the line, take your kindness for weakness and that’s weak.""",Drake,2015,[78],1

Her body's hot
Her body's like the summer
I'm in a trance or something
Her mind is not, no
As sharp as all her diamonds
She must be smoking something

I see her dancing in the streets
Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats

She really thinks that she can move

249,Crushin' It,"I sure could use an attaboy or a big old high five
I'd love to hear ""you're killing it, dude"", yeah it's been a long time
Since I hit one out of the park or nailed it as they say
I guess I've been in a dry spell but that's about to change

Cause every week has a weekend, by this time Friday night
I'll be done with my third can of cold Bud Light
And I'll be crushin' it, yeah I'll be crushin' it

They say your baby's mad cause you told her that you'd hang some pictures for her
You know the ones she framed late last spring of you and her in Florida
You're up on the ladder when it shatters into smithereens
She shakes her head, looks at you and says
""Ain't you good for anything?"" and you say

Every week has a weekend, by this time Friday night
You want a margarita, I'll get Tequila and ice
And I'll be crushin' it, with a cold one in my other hand
I'll be crushin' it, when I'm finished with my can
I can stomp it with my boot, crunch it with my fist
Smash it on my forehead, yeah I got this
I'll be crushin' it, oh I'll be crushin' it

I figured this out in college, walking past them Gothic columns
That I was gonna probably wind up somewhere near the bottom
I was never gonna be the best and brightest guy around
But like the great George freakin Strait, I'm the king of getting unwound

""Boy this thing is really, really goes high!""

(My sincerest apologies, I mean it)
Look, I'll admit it, albeit pathetic
That I'm in my late 20s, still never been to a wedding
Guess the idea of that lobby empty do not sit with me well
It’s not your fault they try get me cause I'ma need the sales
Cause I'm selfish, and I need you to myself
Tryna see you afloat, but don't wanna see you excel
Cause I failed and see you 'bout to cry
Cause when I enter they city they leave without they pride
I'm sorry, and you starin' at my comments
Fearin' it's gone always be you sharin' me with all them
Wrong, how dare I say ignore them?
Preparing for that day I leave you here and switch you for them
It's hard, you know temptation and all
Bitches out here tryna see if my relationship's strong
Get a place in the charts or runaway from your heart
Gave this music my all, nothing is sacred no more - I'm wrong

Realest shit I ever wrote, if you ever knew love)
I’ll admit it, let me be hypothetic
The day I find a woman I prolly be scared to share it
The idea of me finding love, would run somebody off
And true my wall could use some plaques, but still I gotta floss
Brush you off, see I'm kinda lost
Now I'm up in the club with a couple of move ons
And dark, good nigga, troubled heart
Went from fallin' in love to drunk and fallin' apart
This is hard, tryna find some time to move on
Cause when we lost our baby, I got shady, shit got too dark
Soft, and I thank you baby, you strong
My ex before you married too, you solo, I say so long
Nah, good terms how that ended
But it surely put a dent on how I worry about this business
Off white picket fences, on flights with the children
On site stealin' kisses on off nights my intentions but

Come on

[Chorus: Janet Jackson]
You’re missing me, I’m missing you
Whenever we meet, we ain’t gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
It’s fait accompli, we ain’t gonna get no sleep

[Verse 1: Janet Jackson]
A vision rolling round in my head, but I don’t really talk about it
I’m loving what you’re doing to me
And I don’t wanna do without it
Day and night, I dream of us doing whatever
But I guess I’ll have to wait until that day comes

[Chorus: Janet Jackson]
You’re missing me, I’m missing you
Whenever we meet, we ain’t gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
It’s fait accompli, we ain’t gonna get no sleep

[Verse 2: Janet Jackson]
48 hours of love, It's gonna be a weekend marathon
So you better get ready, my king
Cause I'ma be the queen of insomnia
Stay wide awake for every moment we spend together
Cause every second you’re away feels like forever

[Chorus: Janet Jackson]
You’re missing me, I’m missing you
Whenever we meet, we ain’t gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
It’s fait accompli, we ain’t gonna get no sleep

[Bridge: Janet Jackson]
Don’t have time to sleep, but we can dream
So think outside the box, my baby
Show me how much you were missing me
I’ll read between the lines and I sure hope it rains

[Interlude: Janet Jackson (J. Cole)]
Cole world (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah (turn the overall volume up a lil bit, up a lil bit)
How's that? (yeah that’s nice)
We ain’t gonna get no sleep (need time, just a lil more, just a lil more, now, just a lil more now)
We ain’t gonna get no sleep (need time, just a lil more, just a lil more, now, just a lil more now)
We ain’t gonna get no sleep

[Verse 3: J. Cole (Janet Jackson)]
I go my way, you go yours
You taste real life, I taste tours (alright)
Sweet at first, but after a while
Too much sugar, they say, is bad for your smile
And I wear a frown now, 'cause I miss real
I miss a warm house, and home cooked meals
And you miss junk food, that’s why we work
You bring cooked food and I bring dessert
Uh, and meet up at the place that we always do
The one swimming through my mind, that was always you
Our time together has inspired a song or two
Or three, or four, or more, mi amor
I’m sure, either you’re the one or I’m caught in the matrix
Staying up for hours while we talk and get wasted
Not from weed smoke, or this cheap wine
Drunk off love we both feel deep down
But too scared to say cause we know how this ends
Thinking, maybe we’d be better off friends with benefits
For the moment this adrenaline, got me feeling like a kid again
Butterflies like MJ, had to fit it in
My schedule, check the bezel, gotta escape by six
Damn, how’d it get so late so quick?
The sun rising (already?) until the next time
I love diving in your mind and coming out with every diamond I can find (We ain't gonna get no sleep)
No sleep, no sleep

[Chorus: Janet Jackson (J. Cole) Simultaneous]
Can't stop, yeah  (we not, just a lil more, just a lil more, now, just a lil more now)
Can't stop (just a lil more, now, just a lil more now) we ain’t gonna get no sleep (no sleep)

Like an astronaut that's scared of heights
With a heart that's beating at the speed of light
You've been waiting for this feeling all your life
Sometimes it's just hard to realize

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're stuck in a moment
And your spark has been stolen
This is our time to own it
So own it

Baby, we were born with
Fire and gold in our eyes, eyes

Got lightning in a bottle
Hands on the throttle
Even in the dust we shine

There is something different about you and I
And I feel like I have known you my whole life
There is beauty behind every tear you've cried

Fire and gold in our eyes, eyes

It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss

While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag
Now they're going to bed and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his

Chest now, he takes off her dress now
Let me go
I just can't look, it's killing me

259,Kings Never Die,"[Produced by The New Royales]

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can hear the drummer drummin'
And the trumpets, someone's tryna summon someone
I know something's comin'
But I'm runnin' from it, to be standing at the summit
And plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was?
Was it too good to be true?
Have nothin', get it all but too much of it
Then lose it again, did I swallow hallucinogens?
‘Cause if not, where the hell did it go?
‘Cause here I sit in Lucifer’s den by the dutch oven
Just choosing to sin, even if it means I'm sellin' my soul
Just to be the undisputed again
Do whatever I gotta do just to win
‘Cause I got this motherfuckin' cloud over my head
Crown around it, thorns on it
Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't think I'd be back, did ya?
How 'bout that? I’m somehow now back to the underdog
But no matter how loud that I bark
This sport is somethin' I never bow-out at
I complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it's a love-hate
But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt
Even when you bitches are countin' me out
And I appear to be down for the count
Only time I ever been out and about
Is drivin' around town with my fuckin' whereabouts in a doubt
‘Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here
But I'm not a quitter; gotta get up, give it all I got or give up
Spit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept goin'
I'm tryna be headstrong
But it feels like I slept on my neck wrong
‘Cause you're moving onto the next, but is your respect gone?
‘Cause someone told me that…

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Kings never die

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Don't give me that sob story, liar, don't preach to the choir
You ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep
Nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer
Wouldn't even take shit into consideration
Obliterate anyone in the way
I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features
And try to show out on a track with me
But it'd actually have to be
A fuckin' blow-out to get me to retire
Tell these new artists that kings never die
I know shit has changed in this age, fuck a Twitter page
Did it just say I've been upstaged?
Why am I online? It's driving me crazy
I'm ridin' shotgun tryna get a gauge
On what's hot, but I'm not one to conform
But as days pass in this shit
And opinions sway, I can hear 'em say
If I stay passionate maybe I can stage a miraculous
Comeback, as if I went away
But detractors just say so much for the renegade
Someone's gonna make me blow my composure
Here I go again, center stage, and I feel like I'm in a cage
They so want a champion to fall
It's no wonder why I laugh at 'em
‘Cause why can't we win 'em all?
So fuck what these cynics say!
It just goes to show that when my back's against the wall
And I'm under attack again, that I'll act as if I'm 'posed ta
With this pent-up rage, ‘cause all these plaques in my office
On the floor stacked against the door
Are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again?
‘Cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards
And trophies just don't mean jack anymore
If I'm here today and gone tomorrow, and I'm not gonna be…

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I want it, I'm comin' to get it
So you son of a bitches don't duck
You’re gonna get Riddick Bowe’d
Critics'll end up in critical
Think your shit is dope, all you're gonna get is smoked
And I ain't stopping 'til I'm on top again
All alone and on a throne, like a token of respect
Or a homage poem, or an ode I've been owed
Tossed in the air by my own arm
And launched so hard it broke my collarbone
And when it's my time to go
I'm still not leaving, stop for no one, I don't know
But I've been told, an obstacle that blocks your road, ya
Knock it over, time to go for the pot of gold, ‘cause…

[Bridge: Eminem]
They say kings never die
Just ask Jam Master Jay
They just grow wings and they fly
So, hands up, reach for the sky!
Try to hold on and prolong these moments
‘Cause in a blink of an eye
They'll be over

[Verse 4: Eminem]
So you're tryna secure your legacy like Shakur
And ensure nobody's ever gonna be what you were
So before you're leavin' this Earth
You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral, berserk
Deacon of words, syllable genius at work
Plus, I'm thinkin' that they're mistakin' my kindness for weakness; kill 'em with meanness
I went from powdered milk and Farina
To flippin' burgers on the grill for some peanuts
At Gilbert's to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas
Still appeal to the dreamers
I made it to the silverscreen
But Rocky's still what the theme is
Khalil on the beat, ‘cause makin' the beat
Ain’t the same feelin' to me as killin' the beat is
Or fulfillin' to me is what fillin' a seat is
It's that sound-bombing, Thirstin Howl
Common, underground, Diamond D, Outsidaz
Stomach growl, throbbin' hunger, out-rhymin' everyone
God, just give me one shot, I swear that I won't let you down
I'ma be around forever-and-a-day, even in the ground
You ain't never ever gonna hear 'em say I ain't…

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone

264,Sippin' On Fire,"[Verse 1]
Girl, you melt me like ice in whiskey
With those blue flame looks that you give me
You can't hide what's inside
And it's killing me right now to see you wanna slip off with me again

[Chorus]
Why should we go round and round the truth, like we've been doing?
Every time we lie, girl, we're losing
So why should we spend Saturday night alone
When I can call you on the phone, pick you up
Make it up as we go along
Pull an all nighter, chasing that desire
Sparks flying in her eyes like lighters (like lighters)
Get a little higher (get a little higher)
Sippin' on fire

[Verse 2]
You act like you don't know what you're missing
Every time you end up back with him
Cause it's safe, and you're scared
Of everything you're feeling when we're burning the midnight down again

[Chorus]
Why should we go round and round the truth, like we've been doing?
Every time we lie, girl, we're losing
So why should we spend Saturday night alone

Pull an all nighter, chasing that desire
Sparks flying in her eyes like lighters (like lighters)
Get a little higher (get a little higher)

Every goodbye is bitter sweet
So why should we fight what we both need?

Why should we go round and round the truth, like we've been doing?
Every time we lie, girl, we're losing
So why should we spend Saturday night alone
When I can call you on the phone, pick you up

In between the coats in the closet
She held on to that heart shaped locket
Staring at a family flawless
But it ain't a pretty picture tonight
Mom and daddy just wouldn't stop it

Cuts through the walls catastrophic
She's caught in the crossfire (Crossfire)
Puts her hands over her ears
Starts talking through her tears
She's sayin', and she's prayin'

I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt, no one
Just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)

No pain, no damage done

And just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue

Wish there was a white flag waving
Or that they were both just faking
And it was just a game they were playing like shoot 'em up cowboys
Leave the plastic pistols in the front yard
Throw away the score card and just turn off all the noise

All we wanted was an opportunity

[Verse 1: Drake & Rick Ross]
It's your worst nightmare, it's my first night here
And this girl right here, who knows what she knows?
So I'm going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
And her purse right there, I don't trust these hoes at all
But that's just the result of me paying attention
To all these women that think like men with the same intentions
Talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
Even a couple pornstars that I'm ashamed to mention
But Weezy and Stunna my only role models
Haffa and Jordan my only role models
That's why I walk around with all this gold on
And every time I run into these niggas, they want no problems
Bottom sixes and chains, and some bracelets and rings
All of the little accents that make me a king
I never hear the disses they try and point out to me
But it's whatever if somebody won't make it a thing
I'm more concerned with niggas thinkin' 'bout Christmas in August
Do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
Get some shake, a brick in the press
And chef it like Mrs. Fields; they're making the cookie stretch
I know it so well, I know the hustle so well
Stunt like I'm working overnighters right by the motel
Drug money outfit, record clean
Spend it all on me and my fuckin' team
Matchin' Rollies for real, matchin' Rovers for real (woo!)
Places they say they've been, we actually going for real (woo!)
I'm really killin' shit, fuck all the jiggy rapping (woo!)
I'm going trigger happy just to see my niggas happy (woo!)
Mixtape legend, underground kings
Lookin' for the right way to do the wrong things (huh!)
With my new bitch that's living in Palm Springs
Young ass nigga, lifelong dreams
They take the greats from the past and compare us
I wonder if they'd ever survive in this era
In a time where it's recreation
To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations
I know of all the things that I hear they be poking fun at
Never the flow though, they know I run that
Fuck you all, I claim that whenever
I changed rap forever, the game back together, yeah
YM, I remain that forever
In the same place my brother Wayne at forever
I'm a descendant of either Marley or Hendrix
I haven't figured it out 'cause my story is far from finished
I'm hearing all of the jokes, I know that they tryna push me
I know that showin' emotion don't ever mean I'm a pussy
Know that I don't make music for niggas who don't get pussy
So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me
Lord knows, Lord knows, I'm heavy, I got my weight up
Roberson boost your rate up, it's time that somebody paid up
A lot of niggas came up off of a style that I made up
But if all I hear is me, then who should I be afraid of?
Bought a white Ghost now shit is gettin' spooky
Very, very scary like shit you see in the movies
In this bitch, all drinks on the house like Snoopy
That's why all the real soldiers salute me
Trill nigga, for real

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
Huh! You know I love this
YOLO, you only live once
I'm going so hard my nigga, I swear homie
Every day is another opportunity to reach that goal

The hustle's an art, I painted what I would think
Still allergic to broke, prescription straight to the paper
Destined for greatness, but got a place in Jamaica (woo!)
Villa on the water with the wonderful views (views)
Only fat nigga in the sauna with Jews (Jews)
Went and got a yacht, I'm talkin' Carnival cruise
And these niggas talking like hoes, they mad they not in my shoes
It's the red bottom boss (huh!), came to buy the bar (huh!)
Every bi-week, shit, I'm bound to buy a car (woo!)
Murder-cedes Benz or that bubble double R (woo!)
Headlights flicking, looking like a falling star
Everyday them hammers bang, whipping yay like Anna Mae (Anna Mae)
I run the gang but the ladies think I'm running game (running game)
Mink coats make your woman wanna fornicate (fornicate)

Tasting on the molly got me dancing with the devil
Poured a 8th of Kobe Bryant mixing purple with the yellow
Got these racks on me, now it's hard to keep this shit together

Money gon' stack and this money gon' fall though

Came from the hood now we jump out of states
Peep all these diamonds, they jump out the face
Ducking indictments and selling this white
Got to watch for these niggas they'll jump on your case

And none of this money don't come out the safe
Fuck with my dawg, knock a chunk out ya face
Nigga I be so high, I could jump out to space
What the fuck did I say?

[Verse 2: Future]
I be so fly, just don't shoot my cape
Went and bought me a safe and it came with a Wraith
Got some new money, went and bought me a K
You see all them VV's jump out the face
Put that dope in the trap and cook up me a cake
We fly to Cuba to fuck up some mula
Pour up some pour up, my nigga we boolin'
Young nigga pull up in Bentleys just boolin'
I'm taking your ho from you cause she was choosy
I keep them shooters on deck, I approve it
Get me a truck of them things, I'll move it

Get out your feelings, young nigga let's get it

I've been, peeping you niggas been watching my moves
Watching my stacks and my shoes

We was on Jimmy Choos

Margielas was cool
When you lil niggas was worried about Jordans
We was rocking them Loubs
If I got to lose it's not by the rules
Get hit with that chopper knock right out your shoes
Shawty so proper she look like a goddess
When I dip inside her it's just like a pool
I bought some Rarris and I bought some Phantoms
And then dropped out the seat like I dropped out of school
Still will pull up on you hop out with goons
Thirty-two shots let it pop out the tool

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Saturday mornin', I ain't gotta work
Last night's show sold a lot of merch
Bad bitch in my bed so I ain't gotta jerk
Forbes List caught me so it's hard to make a dollar hurt
All we need is good green and some Bou Lou
Five to one, so it's guaranteed you can do you

Black girls go crazy
College girls go crazy
This the type of shit to make the hood go crazy

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
So much liquor, I never spare that kitchen
Keep it so I usually have a pair that's kissin'
And I'm lifted on purple hair, that's bitchin'
Now that's what I call a fuckin' air Technician
Down there, they got the hair that's missin'
Keep it bare, I promise I'll never tear that kitten
I am aware sex hittin' is the care when I share that stick and
So good I might impair that vision
So I dip in then dip off, look for another chick then they pissed off
'Til I give them another spliff then they lift off
Party is the mission, I did cross three thick friends
We mixin' these licks when they big friend wanna lip off
So I told her kindly, ""Get lost, bitch""

My fourth foreign car was a Porsche four door, white (TRU)
Cooler than a polar bear in a bowl of ice
With a ring, married to the game, had 'em throwin' rice
Wait a minute, put my thing in her, I'm tryna knock up
I'm tryna put a singer in her so I can do a banger with her
I get brain for dinner
I don't need to put tender for contender, thank God for strippers
High top with zippers, hard as some nipples
All the shit I do is straight off the temple
Tryna squeeze it into my schedule is like a pimple
Tell that poodle, ""Don't mess around with them pitbulls""

Grindin' bitches from behind

Spit it up, spit it up, spit it up!
This Kan' City, shit's ran gritty
In the summertime the chicks be damn pretty
Born in the projects, then to the Ville
Then I did a deal with Travis and made mills
This is celebration, this is elevation
Me and my delegation got niggas hella hatin'
This is Nnutthowze, Regime, Rogue Dog
And it's all Strange Music, winners can't lose it, unless
Everybody got they hands up like (whoa!)

[Verse: P.O.S]
God Damn Chan!
Laced us with this beat
So now I grace this lovely shit
With something taken from the reaches of my dreams
Blood and guts
Fucker what's and accusations
Pucker ups, sleeper nuts
And adult situations

And dropping steady foot by foot
Story after story
Passing time, no time to take a look
Dory prolly sorry
Nemo lost but really ain't too shook
Stef is prolly left behind
But chilling with a solid book

Like, like they ain't coming back
And I refuse to feel a feeling
Like they ain't looking out
But I got eyes on every villain
Know the best way out
Like every room’s a burning building
Show the worthless to the dumpster
Keep the true and willing

Filling up on junk (junk)
Passing up on sustenance
Busting under stress they pushing buttons
How they rest? I bet they don't
Like even if they earned it (if they earned it)
Turn too many other cheeks
You learn to watch em burn shit

[Chorus]
I don't even know us anymore
I don't know how we got this far
How did we just get so far home?
We ain't in Kansas anymore

I don't even know us anymore

How did we just get so far home?
We ain't in Kansas anymore

[Verse: Astronautalis]
I was lost in the weeds
Imbalanced chemically
Superchunk, indie punk
Tossing these seeds
Holding onto memories
Tracing these frail steps
Suicidal tendencies
Subliminally fucked with, yeah

Everybody love LA
Until you travel to the Bay
Everybody want to stray
Until you realize she bae

Lock it down! Block em out!
Put a ring up on it (quick)
In the club with you singing
“Throw some D's up on that bitch!”
Empty floor! Let em talk!
We ain't worried bout that shit
Whole city is our club
And we run that fucking thing! (hahaha)

Broke in the construction site
Years before we'd ever fight
Making out in the street lights
Now this is fucking our life!

God damned fucking right!
God damned fucking right!
Now this is fucking our life!
God damned fucking right!

Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Countin' money, you know how it goes
Pray the real live forever, man
Pray the fakes get exposed
I want that Ferrari, then I swerve
I want that Bugatti, just to hurt
I ain't rockin' my jewelry, that's on purpose
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it
I don't like how serious they take themselves
I've always been me, I guess I know myself
Shakiness, man, I don't have no time for that
My city too turned up, I'll take the fine for that
This been where you find me at
That's been where you find me at
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling
He put me on to the finer things
Had a job sellin' Girbaud jeans
I had a yellow TechnoMarine
Then Kanye dropped, it was polos and backpacks

Don't fuck with them niggas, they too irrational, woah

[Verse 2]
This is that nasty flow
Top boy in this shit, I'm so international
Reps up is in here
Got P Reign and Chubby and TJ and Winnie and whoa
Yeah, and you know how that should go
I might declare it a holiday as soon as Baka get back on the road
Yeah, but you know how that should go
They so irrational, they don't wanna patch it up
They wanna mash it up, woah
My nigga Jibba, he whip it, I ride in the passenger
I'm way up, I stay up, I'm two up, I'm three up
I had to get back to you, woah
I'm turnin' into a nigga that thinks about money and women
Like 24/7, that's where my life took me
That's just how shit happened to go
And you know
Runnin' through the 6 with my, with my

I was running through the 6 with my woes

Dear future husband
Here's a few things you'll need to know if
You wanna be my one and only
All my life

[Verse 1]
Take me on a date, I deserve it, babe
And don't forget the flowers every anniversary
'Cause if you'll treat me right, I'll be the perfect wife
Buying groceries, buy-buying what you need
You got the 9 to 5, but baby, so do I
So don't be thinkin' I'll be home and baking apple pies
I never learned to cook, but I can write a hook
Sing along with me, sing, sing along with me (Hey)

You've gotta know how to treat me like a lady
Even when I'm actin' crazy
Tell me everything's alright

You wanna be my one and only
All my life
Dear future husband
If you wanna get that special loving
Tell me I'm beautiful each and every night (Woo)

[Verse 2]
After every fight, just apologize
And maybe then I'll let you try and rock my body right
Even if I was wrong, you know I'm never wrong
Why disagree, why, why disagree

You've gotta know how to treat me like a lady
Even when I'm actin' crazy
Tell me everything's alright (Alright)

Dear future husband
Here's a few things you'll need to know if
You wanna be my one and only

Dear future husband
Make time for me, don't leave me lonely
And no, we'll never see your family more than mine

I'll be sleeping on the left side of the bed (Hey)
Open doors for me and you might get some... kisses
Don't have a dirty mind, just be a classy guy

288,One Last Time,"[HAMILTON]
Mr. President, you asked to see me?

[WASHINGTON]
I know you’re busy

[HAMILTON]
What do you need, sir? Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
I wanna give you a word of warning

[HAMILTON]
Sir, I don’t know what you heard
But whatever it is, Jefferson started it

[WASHINGTON]
Thomas Jefferson resigned this morning

[HAMILTON]
You’re kidding

[WASHINGTON]
I need a favor

[HAMILTON]
Whatever you say, sir, Jefferson will pay for his behavior

[WASHINGTON]
Shh. Talk less

[HAMILTON]
I’ll use the press
I’ll write under a pseudonym, you’ll see what I can do to him—

[WASHINGTON]
I need you to draft an address

[HAMILTON]
Yes! He resigned. You can finally speak your mind—

[WASHINGTON]
No, he’s stepping down so he can run for President

[HAMILTON]
Ha. Good luck defeating you, sir

[WASHINGTON]
I’m stepping down. I’m not running for President

[HAMILTON]
I’m sorry, what?

[WASHINGTON]
One last time
Relax, have a drink with me
One last time
Let’s take a break tonight
And then we’ll teach them how to say goodbye
To say goodbye
You and I

[HAMILTON]
No, sir, why?

[WASHINGTON]
I wanna talk about neutrality

[HAMILTON]
Sir, with Britain and France on the verge of war, is this the best time—

[WASHINGTON]
I want to warn against partisan fighting

[HAMILTON]
But—

[WASHINGTON]
Pick up a pen, start writing
I wanna talk about what I have learned
The hard-won wisdom I have earned

[HAMILTON]
As far as the people are concerned
You have to serve, you could continue to serve—

[WASHINGTON]
No! One last time
The people will hear from me
One last time
And if we get this right
We’re gonna teach ‘em how to say
Goodbye
You and I—

[HAMILTON]
Mr. President, they will say you’re weak

[WASHINGTON]
No, they will see we’re strong

[HAMILTON]
Your position is so unique

[WASHINGTON]
So I’ll use it to move them along

[HAMILTON]
Why do you have to say goodbye?

[WASHINGTON]
If I say goodbye, the nation learns to move on
It outlives me when I’m gone
Like the scripture says:
“Everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree
And no one shall make them afraid.”
They’ll be safe in the nation we’ve made
I wanna sit under my own vine and fig tree
A moment alone in the shade
At home in this nation we’ve made
One last time

[HAMILTON]
One last time

Though, in reviewing the incidents of my administration, I am unconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my defects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. I shall also carry with me

Of our mutual cares, labors, and dangers (Of our mutual cares, labors, and dangers)

Looks like royal in a thrift store dress
Keeps my heart and her hair a mess

She's a calico pony on an open plain
I know I'll never be the same no more, for sure

She's a wild child
Got a rebel soul with a whole lot of gypsy wild style
She can't be tied down but for a while
I'll be falling free and so in love
Might break my heart but God she drives me wild child

You've never heard of her favorite band unless you
Been to Bonnaroo or Burning Man
She's Penny Lane in a Chevy van, she loves to love

She loves me wild child
Got a rebel soul with a whole lot of gypsy wild style
She can't be tied down but for a while
I'll be falling free and so in love
Might break my heart but God she drives me wild child

Watch my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again

[Chorus: Britney Spears & Iggy Azalea]
All around the world, pretty girls
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks, bring the noise
(It's Iggy-Iggs!)
We're just so pretty!
All around the world, pretty girls
Jump the line, to the front
Do what we like, get what we want
(Where you at, Brit?)
We're just so pretty!

[Verse 1: Britney Spears]
Hey, don't you know that it's always the same?
From Australia 'round to LA
You can betcha', wherever the girls go, boys follow
We be keeping them up on their toes
They can laugh, but they don't get the jokes
Set your watch, they're so predictable
(Some things don't change...)

[Pre-Chorus: (Britney Spears) & Iggy Azalea]
(The girls roll up) Windows roll down
(Eyes on us) Jaws on the ground
(Watch them go) It's just so funny
(Like bees to the honey!)

[Chorus: Britney Spears & Iggy Azalea]
All around the world, pretty girls
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks, bring the noise
We're just so pretty!
All around the world, pretty girls
Jump the line, to the front
Do what we like, get what we want
We're just so pretty!

[Verse 2: Britney Spears]
Tell me, is it true that these men are from Mars?
Is that why they be acting bizarre?
Every time I walk out of my house it's like, ""Hey, baby!""
They don't see me rolling my eyes
They buzzing around me like flies
They got one thing on their minds
(Some things don't change...)

[Pre-Chorus: (Britney Spears) & Iggy Azalea]
(The girls roll up) Windows roll down
(Eyes on us) Jaws on the ground
(Watch them go) It's just so funny
(Like bees to the honey!)

[Chorus: Britney Spears & Iggy Azalea]
All around the world, pretty girls
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks, bring the noise
We're just so pretty!
All around the world, pretty girls
Jump the line, to the front
Do what we like, get what we want
We're just so pretty!

[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
Damn, still killing them softly
I would spend time with you but that'd cost me
They pray that Iggy-Iggy give 'em one more chance
But busy Iggy wouldn't even give 'em one more glance
See, it's a thin line between the beauty and the beast
Slim waist, thick cake, the whole world want a piece
Bad girl, good (ooh) would make you lose your mind
All of the boys begging Britney, hit 'em one more time
Iggs

[Chorus: Britney Spears & Iggy Azalea]
All around the world, pretty girls
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks, bring the noise
We're just so pretty!
All around the world, pretty girls
Jump the line, to the front

Niggas was fake so I kept me a Ruger in Regals

295,Blessings,"[Intro: Drake & Big Sean]
Look
I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
(Straight... up)

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I live the life I deserve, blessed
Fuck a vacay, I feel better at work
I mean, whatever it's worth, I give whatever I'm worth
For my niggas who gon' go to Hell and back for me
I'ma give 'em Heaven on Earth
Or a hell of a check, yeah, whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life, man, that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like father, forgive me, these are all my confessions
Man, this wasn't luck, it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd n Eddy
Who flip like confetti
And then when you back, they back to call you ""dog""
That shit get-get petty, bitch, don't give no dap to me, nigga
Funny thing about talking behind my back
Is that it just keep coming back to me, nigga
Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga, you mad at me
This ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night working after three, man
This is why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty, man
The clique is the tightest, the pussy the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just gotta thank God that we got it
Blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your prophet will profit, oh God

[Chorus: Drake & Big Sean]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look, I ain't gon' say that we back or nothing
‘Cause that implies that we're back from something
If we're back from somethin' there's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothing less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks 'bout where the Grammys go
I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram
Them OVO boys, the business man
It is what it is, trust me, you get what you give, yeah
You gotta come to my side and see how we live, yeah
I cannot see Heaven being much better than this, yeah
Blessings on blessings for me and my niggas from the 6
Look at what we did, yeah
Be quiet, I'm doing a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit, I swear, y'all be doing the most
Stop worrying 'bout whoever's next
I am just worried 'bout my mama worrying less
I think I'm famous enough, I don't need any more press
I am convinced I'm the only one left
That's still doing this shit, man

[Chorus: Drake & Big Sean]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
My grandma just died, I'm the man of the house
So every morning I'm up ‘cause I can't let them down, down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align
You do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm going over time, on the overtime
Yeah, I'm that invested, but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never going anorexic
I pay my own mortgage and electric
Never going under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checking off my check list
Try and blow my cake, just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart, who put it back together? I

[Chorus: Drake & Big Sean]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
Since the truth keep niggas traumatized
They tryna compromise my condom size
So I Snapchat that whole shit
Tryna see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God I hope they post it
I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See three P.O.'s like Star Wars
They want me by the road holding up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now, I'm calling you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga, I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there getting home-schooled
I'm blessed
And I was thinking 'bout starting up my own school
A Montessori
And the hallway looking like a monastery, oh yes
I'm way up, I feel blessed",Big Sean,2015,"[48, 46, 46, 43, 45, 35, 32, 28, 29, 28, 28, 30, 30, 33, 35, 30, 36, 68, 53, 54]",20
296,Lay Me Down,"[Verse 1]
Yes I do, I believe
That one day I will be where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, the stars are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain the way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

[Pre-Chorus]
Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

[Chorus]
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?
And make sure you're all right
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

[Verse 2]
I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy

You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

298,Believe,"[Verse 1]
And I started from the bottom
Like a snowman—ground-up
Like round chuck, and still put hands on you
Stayin' wound up is how I spend time (Get it?)
Sucker free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes
I just got that air about me like wind chimes (Yeah)
'Nother day in the life (Uh)
Used to have to scrape to get by (Yeah)
Now my community's gated and I
Made it and my neighbors say hi (Say hi)
I'm givin' 'em pounds, I'm upscale now
Guess it means I'm way in the sky (Way in the sky)
But I still remember the days of
Minimum wage for general labor
Welfare recipient since a minor
Look how government assistance has made ya!
Adversity, if at first you don't succeed
Put your temper to more use
'Cause bein' broke's a poor excuse
That should only give you more fuel
Show 'em why you're you
So close, God, it's like I almost got it
But close only counts in time bombs and horseshoes
So I Unabomb shit—tick, tick, tick—no remorse, pew!
Screw it, I'm lit, and that attitude I blew up on quick
That's why they call me firecracker
I grew up on WIC—wick, wick, wick—with a short fuse
I got some important news to report to
Anyone who thought I was done: nah bitch, not quite
Spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours?

[Chorus]
Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

[Verse 2]
Man, I know sometimes
These thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice
To me they're just ink blots
I just fling 'em like slingshots and so precise
So you might wanna think it over twice (Yeah)
Or you retards can roll the dice
But beef will at least cost you your career
'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced
But this middle finger's free as a bird
Nuke warhead at birth, hugest forehead on Earth
Too short for the verse, studied his formula, learned
How to incorporate a curse
Point it towards corporate America
Stick a fork in and turn
'Cause four-letter words are more better heard
The world force-fed a turd to me, you're getting yours
But sometimes I overdo it, but I just get so into it
I was there consolin' you when no one knew it
When your situation showed no improvement
I was that door, you walked over to it
I'm the light at the end of the tunnel
So people are always lookin' to me as they're goin' through it
When that tunnel vision is unclear
Shit becomes too much to bear
Since ""Cleanin' Out My Closet""
When I was havin' trouble with the snare
I'm that unrealistic prayer answered
And I'ma get you jacked up like you're tryna fix a flat, uh
When you struggle with despair
That double-fisted, bare-knuckles coupled with this pair
Of nuts I'm cuppin', I am your 'fuck it' switch, nothin' can compare

[Chorus]
Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

[Verse 3]
Started from the bottom like a snowman
Oh man, put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that
But my battery's low, I'ma need a boost to my pack
And I know that I always got Proof at my back
I called you ""Proof"" because I knew for a fact
My ace in the hole, homie, I'm callin' on you
'Cause I think I'm slowly startin' to lose faith in it, so
Give me that inkling and mo–
–tivation to go, Hussein with the flow
Fake fans that are two-faced didn't show
Let heartbeats loop, produce hate in my soul
Layin' vocals two days in a row
True statement, hate to go down this road
But there's only one route to cross this bridge
So I walk in this bitch with loose change
'Cause all my dues paid, but this booth's takin' its toll
But it's never too late to start a new beginnin'
That goes for you too, so what the fuck you gon' do?
Use the tools you're given!
Or you're gon' use the cards you're dealt
As an excuse for you to not do shit with 'em?
I used to play the loser/victim
'Til I saw the way Proof was driven
I found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet
And when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets
Fanny packs, hourglasses
If time was on my side, I'd still have none to waste
Man, in my younger days
That dream was so much fun to chase
It's like I'd run in place
While this shit dangled in front of my face
But how do you keep up the pace
And the hunger pangs once you've won the race?
When that dual exhaust is coolin' off
'Cause you don't got nothin' left to prove at all
'Cause you done already hit 'em with the coup de grâce
Still you feel the need to go full tilt
That Bruce Willis, that Blue Steel, that true skill
When that wheel's loose, I won't lose will

299,I Don't Get Tired (#IDGT),"{Verse 1]
Look five four three two step back I'm the one
See I knew it when I started rapping, in my city they shoulder bump
Don't look back just work hard, don't fall off on no bull shit
Aye Pedro we got time; tell ma dukes we do this, wait
I got a daughter she looking like what you be doing
Your daddy be working I see you be purpin' you labels be talking like what you pursuing
Don't ask me no questions just peep what I’m doing. You talking bout me see I seek & I do it
I know they be hating don't look at me stupid. Mama she told me you got it go do it
Now sit back & listen, let me go get it; people they seem to be all in my business
I tell you that people be all in my business, don't love it but hate it but they pay attention
Be all in my comments but I stay persistent. Got niggas who watching I give em a ticket
I give em a ticket, I flip it salute to the niggas who love it and watch how I whip it
I gotta go through it, I gotta stay focus. Maybe I'm crazy or maybe I want it. Hold up
I just be going & going I can't even stop with this weight on my shoulder
I love black women with tattoos, lord knows I can't even touch it
My brother told me she bad news. Send a text shit I'm trying to  fuck you
Man its crazy cause she wanna lay with me, bae I can't even stay with you
My baby mama be on a nigga, I cheated, shit, but I didn't mean it
I did it once, she took me back, I swear to god I appreciate it
My dumb ass got caught again, got me feeling like she really hate me
My little niece be talking to me, she don't what's about to happen
Me and Pedro on the phone talking that big shit let's get it cracking
Go getters don't get tired, ego big as my dick size
Eating rappers like French fries, gaining weight but I shit fine
It’s me, they looking at me, they looking at me, would you believe?
They scared to do it they self, I guess they need a little help
Got em looking at a nigga belt like how the hell he do that?
Just paid attention that's all, now they looking back like ohh
Now that's when yawl best friends and wanna holla bout yawl dogs
Ask me they brainless. I rather eat' em like a Danish
I rather see a nigga famous; I love it when a nigga make it
Damn I wish I had a record deal, hold on wait I am the record deal
I’m a get it bitch I'm independent, grinding hard I'm in a different city
Play the game I took losses, do it till a nigga balling'
My baby mama she flawless, she had a nigga when I lost it
I love you bae I'm not talking, I fucked up but that was back then
Since 19, told a couple lies we got it straight now we awesome
With two kids wait make it three can't forget Dasia don't call me
Do it for my little sister, Diamond Ellison I love you bae
On prom day I took her, I was messed up but I'm proud to say
I did it, graduate college instead of be killing & catching a body
You know I love rapping it's not just a hobby. Bitch I don't do groupies, they wait I the lobby
Up in the lobby they up in the lobby, tell that little groupie to go in the lobby
I tell that little groupie to stay in the lobby, I say everyday gotta count cause I got it, bitch
If you late let me take you back, back then I had a couple stacks
Had a studio, got pro tools and a couple niggas who I thought could rap
I'm like where they at did they vanish, I’m thinking like that's how the game go
Niggas ever try to come back, shoulder lean like I'm Young Dro
Back then when I had the weed I was selling that young dro
I ain't never sold cocaine, but them fresh ones they was clean though
Me, Pedro, JC, got Sumo, plus little Joe
Dome squad with some Cali niggas, couple of them pretty fake though
Granny see me like, watch your back, niggas ain't really liking us
Hold on wait, I know a couple dudes who tried to rob cuz in a Bentley truck
One late night we in Cali, dice game right up the street
Shook off on a couple niggas cause I ain't got roll fifty deep
See they look when you mention me, niggas book when I hit the streets
Phone call from my little brother, he don't know that we about to eat
I told em never be selfish, like Kevin Gates I’m a die bout it
Locked up cause you rob a nigga, do your time don't cry bout it
Mama Fee she a pop a nigga, don't ask me I’ll lie about it
Like schurr schurr in that black outie, they found the body in J County
Wait one time for my sister, Subena bae I'm so proud of you
Gotta opportunity and took it, side note from your little brother
Late nights after late nights after late nights after late nights
Got a phone call from a bad bitch, man I told that hoe get out my (laughs)

[Outro]
Man I swear to god I just be fooling nigga
Everyday counts, no sleep the mafia man
Niggas be like man you really out here doing this shit man like
Man this rap shit ain’t easy man it’s not for everybody man
You really can’t afford to get tired man, shout out to Kevin Gates though
Like I be having distractions thrown at me and shit but you know I can’t let that shit get to me at all man
I gotta, I do it for my kids man shout out to my son Jaion man
I know I sound real foolish but like I don’t know I do it for my family man
I love yawl to death man my daughter Londynn my son uh my brother you know like my baby mother
Like I don’t know, I be fooling you know like it’s me, DLEE

I'm my own quarterback, put my team on
Luxury, that's all I see
Look at the flicka da wrist, got 'em on me

I woke up with a bad bitch outer space
I hopped up out the bed, money on my mind
Louis V, Ferragamo at the same time
Have you ever had two bitches in your car?
Runnin' plays on these niggas like a point guard
I was only 15 when I called a play
I was up at Lenox Mall, I was in the A
Tell the waiter bring the bread this away
I was with your bitch eatin' crab cakes
Catchin' plays, Super Bowl game

First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche
I don't want her if that ass don't sit like a horse
I be ballin' on these niggas, got me feelin' like sports
Dash got so much wood I could build me a fort
Ain't too many things I ain't done yet
I'm the king of this shit, crown by the toilet
I'm just barely gettin' started, you already upset
Got a tiger as a pet, I just took him to the vet
Homie, I be makin' hits, I'm the rap Derek Jeter
Let your bitch ride on me like she was on the feeder
If the pussy ain't good then I probably won't feed her
Lil homie, you can keep her cause I really don't need her
I ain't worried 'bout features, homeboy, you's a peon
Toilet seat ass nigga, man, I swear you gettin' peed on
Man, my jewelry so cold, I walk around with the heat on
My alarm clock set, just in case they wanna sleep on, ya dig?
I'm a full-time player, hoppin' out in alligator
Sippin' lean and Now and Later, homie, I'll annihilate ya
If you think you wanna battle, you gon' have to pay some paper
I just hit her and I quit her, I would never ever date her
It's a shame how I'm barely gettin' love in the city
Travel to another town, you can bet they fuckin' with me
I be killin' this shit, pray to God they forgive me
They said, ""when you blow up, don't forget me"", man
I been on fire ever since they made the lighter
My boys will pull up on ya, homie, I ain't talkin' diapers
Walk into your function, on point, I'm like a sniper
My girl bad like Dej Loaf so don't try her
Flexin' all you want but homeboy, you ain't ready
Ten times sharper than Michael Myers' machete
Been about the money, I ain't worried 'bout the fame

Told her drop, drop, drop, drop it like it's hot
Dirty talk, dirty dance

She on the rebound, broke up with her ex
And I'm like Rodman, ready on deck

Forgot to face it by myself, I cried

I want you to know

I had to kid because you're the one I see
I looked around, I felt the ground
It's soul not found, it's hard enough for me

Hey, did I let it go?
Stay with me, tell me if it shows


I want you to know

It's always talking you can set it free

I know I dream about her all day
I think about her with her clothes off
I'm ridin' 'round with my system bumpin' LSD
I look for ways to say ""I love you""
But I ain't into makin' love songs
Baby, I'm just rappin' to this LSD
She ain't a stranger to the city life
I introduced her to this hippy life
We make love under pretty lights, LSD (Acid)
I get a feelin' it's a trippy night
Them other drugs just don't fit me right
Girl, I really fuckin' want love, sex, dream
Another quarter to the face system
Make no mistakes, it's all, a leap of faith for love
It takes a place in, feelin' that you crave doin' love, sex, dreams

[Chorus]
It started in Hollywood
Dreamin' of sharin' love
My tongue at a loss for words
Cause my feelings just said it all
Party just started up
Dreamin' of sharin' worlds
Held this feeling for way too long
Said, ""I really wanna let it go""

[Bridge 1]
I've been gettin' fly because the gimmick's so dope
I've been getting high cause I figured Lord told me
I've been drinking, driving, now we'll never go home
I gon' stay in doubt because the weather's so cold, oh

[Bridge 2]
Feeling low sometimes when the light shines down
Makes me high
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Feeling low sometimes when the light shines down
Makes me high
Can you feel it?

Off again, there he go, to another dimension, my mind
Body, soul imprisoned, my eye probably goin' ballistic, but, listen
I'm missin' a couple of screws, they ain't never do drillin' true
You been sippin' away at the truth, a double shot of wisdom'll do
Do, do, rollin' through, hittin' switches
Rolling ditches, blowin' kisses, to the bitches, holdin' biscuits
What's the business? Beat the system
Co-defendants, blow the sentence, go to prison
Go to church and pray the father, Lord forgive us (Amen)
And only God can judge me (Yeah)
And he don't like no ugly
I look so fuckin' good, most dykes'll fuck me, buddy
Yeah, I'm a piece of shit, I know I plead the fifth
I tell her, ""Holler if ya need some dick""
The devotion is gettin' hopeless, but, hold it, I'm gettin' close
As my soul is, I'm seein' ghosts, a solo is now a poet
Hypnosis overdose on potions, adjustin' to the motions
And gettin' out all my emotions

Make a nigga wanna flip September through August
This type of shit got 'em bustin' out the clip
In the middle of the office
And a message to the bosses
The Misfits' new outfit is on the bloglist
Gorgeous hoes keep on the sayin' that they 'caused it
'Cause the Porsches get 'em nauseous
Plus I ain't even mad yet, niggas caught me in a good mood
Paparazzi wanna nag a nigga chillin' at the bag check
Hope they show me in my good shoes
When papa got the brand new bag
Flacko got the brand new Raf, that's good news
""Hood dudes usually don't look like you""
How it feel to get a deal and come back
And the whole hood look like you?
Screamin', ""Pimp Squad, hold it down!""
Can't drive, bitch, I'm legally blind, bitch
If I live or die, it's up to me to decide
Shit, niggas coppin' guns like they legal to buy
The only key to survive and get a piece of the pie
Is to agree with a lot or just believe a façade, bitch
And I'll be fine just-a drinkin' my wine, bitch

309,Phenomenal,"[Hook]
I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I'll never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

[Verse 1]
Unstoppable, unpoppable thought bubbles
Untoppable thoughts, fuckin' juggernaut that'll
Stomp you in a verse, obstacles I'm drawn to 'em
When the going got rough
Some of what I done fought through was the worst, little sissy
Who the fuck taught you how to persevere?
There ain't no situation that you ever had to respond to that's adverse
The messiest thing you've ever gone through was your purse
Yeah, I don't try like hell, then I might as well
Hang it up like a shelf, gotta keep growin' with it, evolve
Cause you can keep throwin' shit at the wall
But you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself
Time to slip in that zone 'til I find myself
Inside the realm of the unknown and boldly go
Into waters where nobody else has gone before
Or willing to go, uncharted, feeling is so
Bomb, I'm feelin' myself, I'm a giant
Sometimes I gotta remind myself that I am...

[Hook]
I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I'll never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

[Verse 2]
Let me self-empower you
When you're down and they're tryin' to clown the fuck out of you
And you feel like you're runnin' out of fuel
I'll show you how to use doubt as fuel
Convert it to gunpowder too
Now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid
Put the spark to it like Martha Stewart barbecuing
Ah screw it, feel like you want to hit that wall then do it
Punch through it, just cock back, put your all into it
Now you gon' take that rage and make that what you wage
Never take back what you say
If you stay strapped in your brain, engaged in a steel cage match
Ready to scrap asap
Take your fists and just ball it
Show who's big and who's smallest you're Christopher Wallace
Now picture 'em all as plastic and foam
Lays flat, where you put your dinner plates at
And set it on 'em like a placemat
(I am phenomenal)
And I want you to say that

[Hook]
I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal

However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I'll never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

[Bridge]
Oh, step into the unknown and find yourself
You’re floating freely, no emotion

[Verse 3]
Got a fuckin’ mouth with no shut-off valve
Can't even cut off power to it, but it's what allowed
Me to come up out from under the fuckin' ground
Cause I worked my butt off now
It's a subject that I don't know how to shut up about
Cause I stuck it out
Like a motherfuckin' tongue thats how
I responded when I got shoved around
You're gonna have non-believers
But when you're beyond belief, you probably shouldn't wonder how
Get it how you live
But are you prepared to give more than you get?
And put in twice what you get back from this shit
Though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give
Rap is my shiv
But it's like my shield at the same time I wield and my knife is will
Sometimes I feel just like B. Real from Cypress Hill
How I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt
I rhyme like life is still an uphill climb
Ready to face any challenge, waitin'
Can taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin' retaliation
Look what I have built, reputation is validation
The only thing I'm capable of makin' is amazing
Only thing you're capable of makin' is a false statement
Or accusation... I am legendary status, in fact
That is the only way you'll ever be able to say
You're a legend is makin' an allegation
I write with the left, same hand I hold the mic with
As I fight to the death, 'til my last breath
Manage to prove who the best man is
Prevail at all costs, be the only ones left standin'
In the end, but I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage
Of knowin' what it's like to be southpaw
Cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed
Cause I am

[Hook]
I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I'll never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal",Eminem,2015,[47],1

You, where the hell did you come from?

I'm mad (He mad!), but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question

Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him

Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street
(Oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can)
I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghost writer?
What the fuck happened? (Oh no!)
I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (A two-man cell)
Something's in the water (Something's in the water)
And if I gotta brown-nose for some gold
Then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller (Oh yeah!)

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
You goat-mouth mammyfucker
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', ""Compton!""
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too
20 million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!
Aw, yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past 25, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin', ""Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?""
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (Oh yeah)

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'—*Gunshot*
By the time you hear the next pop
The funk shall be within you—*Gunshot*

Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him

No suit and tie, but baby I go to work
Don't do it for the money but that's one of the perks
If y'all got the shovel then I've got the dirt
Burying rappers is what I mean when I say take 'em to church!
Oh man I'm back with more bars
Your girlfriend on my score card
Opportunity knocks...
Well someone please tell me where the doors are
Before I trample it ni**a
Somebody better answer this ni**a
If you ain't never heard of me...
I'm bout to show you what the mother f*ckin anthem is ni**a
Diamonds and Treasure, that don't bring me no pleasure
Every day I just wake up, saying I can do better
Tryna find me a girl to put her hands in the holes of my sweater
And truth be told I just pray that this moment last me forever

I don't really think you know what I have been through

Cause I can't put my life inside a pencil, and that's something I'd rather not pretend to....

Couldn't paint what I paint when the bass goes boom
And the lights go low, and they call it magic

Doesn't mean that much to me

Look at how the time goes past

Then one night her taillights fade out into the dark
And a guy walks into a bar

[Verse 2]
I'd laugh too if my heart would let me
Keeping it light will probably help to get me
Over you
I'm walking, talking, drinking proof
A cliché in a corner booth
Ain't nothing new

[Chorus]
A guy walks into a bar, orders a drink
Sees a girl that catches his eye
Asks her if she wants another
They fall for each other and end up lovers
They laugh, cry, hold on tight
Make it work for a little while
Then one night her taillights fade out into the dark
And a guy walks into a bar

Can you feel it? Now it's coming back

Well I'm just a boy with a broken toy
All lost and coy, at the curtains of the waterfall
So it's here I stand, as a broken man
But I've found my friend at the curtains of the waterfall

And you've come around at the curtains of the waterfall
And you rushed to me and it sets us free
So I fall to my knees at the curtains of the waterfall

I am nothing without love
I’m but a ship stuck in the sand

On this sinking ship that love had put me on
God I wish a gust of wind would come and carry me home
But I got nowhere to go

Uh, now, they lost it I found it, we leave 'em astounded
Asking me how you so fly, yet you still so grounded?
I replied, I died inside, resurrected a beast
Leave 'em deceased, music's in my genes like a crease
Got it, capisce? Hungry as hell trying to eat now
Success is the only thing that can complete us
Grinding to free us, the beat knocking like a fetus
Close your eyes, open up your ears so you can see this (Logic)
Now I've accepted I'm not from the hood
Cause sellin' crack and bustin' gats don't make my raps good
See this is me, L.O.G.I.C. reppin' MD to the fullest
Push us to the limit but never pull us, now
I can't wait 'til I see my name in neon
That fly shit I be on flowin' for eons
Every day I take chances, Celine Dion
Said every day I take chances, Celine Dion, let's get it
I'm a diamond in the rough, but I shine like disco
Surrounded by greasy people like I doused them in Crisco
I haven't shined yet, so tell me where does the rest go?
Up a million percent until they finally hear this though
Bumping up in they city like, ""oh my God, this go""
My business getting better every year like fiscal
Fuck a pad and a pen, a mic my only utensil
I'm a original see but they trace like stencil
A stain in the game, but you fade like pencil
Biting off of my rhymes, that ain't even an insult
'Cause you couldn't produce, and in the end that shit's your fault
It takes 3 millions years for a diamond to shine
I did it in 21, see I'm ahead of my time
'Cause when I flow the crowd never roll 'cause I rock
On the road to success, haters in my blind spot
'Cause I got no time to bullshit

I hate to say it a later moment I didn’t warn ya
High roller, big spender
And my intentions to keep her on the sack, you just Saks Fifth her
I’m that different, this cat can react mad pimpish
I gathered a couple hundred thousand, I can’t remember
They keep talkin' and we keep winning
Why niggas never say capisce until police chalk em
Because of my bitch that's talkin', givin' her head, the streets will follow
I come from a place where niggas my age ain't placed to see tomorrow
To each his own but each of them is known to steal or rob you
But jails are overpopulated but know there's seats in college
And those are the least of problems, I speak to God he says I'm alright
My vision funny, though 20/20's my hindsight
Bad bitches with me, real niggas with me
Whole ghetto with me mixin Ketel with the Simply
Like the sweet anguish, find your peace baby
I know the millions you get come with a billion haters, yea

[Chorus]
Forgive me, I’m a rider
Sure I’m just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame
I’m a simple man, lawd
You know that I’m a rider
Tell 'em just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame
I’m a simple man, lawd

[Verse 2]
I’m pickin' apart, my wicked opponents
Get in my zone
Niggas can't join us, so, these niggas done cloned us
Look at me close, see the results you see a nigga a loner
Cause all of the bitches that's giving me grief also be given me boners
Blow up in rap, young and you black
Niggas be blowin' your phone up
Whenever you don’t, lose you a homie, ho
Adult from show cuz
If you get that, then roll up
If you get that, that’s no love
Every move you make they got lip
Every chick you like done got kids
And forget that chick had brought friends
Every jay you hit you need vent
Every friend you got, got M.O's
I’m in a game, even with a deep bench
I'mma ball like small fro Kobe
Without the 8, but all the hate though
Pockets thicker all my niggas, ain't the same though
I just came up, fuck is you sayin' though
Gave the business my heart, it just gave me the finger
Nigga, yeah

[Chorus]
Forgive me, I’m a rider
Sure I’m just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame
I’m a simple man, lawd
You know that I’m a rider
Tell 'em just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame
I’m a simple man, lawd",Wale,2015,[71],1

The ballers in here tonight, they gon’ buy a hundred bottles
As soon as you shake it I know they gon’ make it colossal in here
'Cause shawty you thinkin’ them tricks that you do with your body
Got all of these niggas they crowding around you like they seen Beyonce in here (she here, she here!)
You want your own and you need your own, baby, who am I to judge?
'Cause how could I ever trip about it when I met you in the club?
I make enough for the both of us, but you dance anyway
You know I was raised in the A

When you get off of work I’ll be ready to go in the ‘Rari

You can twerk while in a split, you racking up them tips
Your body rock and your booty poppin’, I’m proud to call you my bitch
They be lookin’, but they can’t touch you, shawty, I’m the only one to get it
So just go ahead and keep doing what you doing

Tryna take somebody bitch, turn her to a slut
Tryna fill my cup, tryna live it up
Throw some hundreds on that ass, walk her out the club
(Yeah, ho) Lap dance for the first date
Bet I threw a few bands, that’s third base
It’s okay if you work late
We can still party like it’s your birthday
We can still party hard in your birthday suit
Knock that pussy out the park like my name Babe Ruth
Shawty she just want a tip, I just want to see her strip
If you fuck me like you love me shawty you might get rich
Have her own cake, her own place
Blow her own gas, no Rolaid
When we in the bed she like to roleplay
Tell her friend to join in both ways

[Chorus: Usher]
Shawty, I don’t mind
If you dance on a pole, that don’t make you a ho

Mob heavy like the Pope, for that pot of gold

What's a flea to a giant, niggas feedin' the fire
History, niggas be less them niggas flee when they flyin'
You don't believe it? Then try it
We don't believe in just tryin'
I call it peoples and leave 'em in 100 pieces divided

And I ain't really going for the he say, or she say
Keep it G for Pete's sake

Might leave you niggas fillets

Is you with all the burglarizing and the violence
If Jimmy got caught up, but you was right there with him
So the police askin' you questions, is you gone keep quiet??
Is you loyal, is you real, is you fake?
When I can't tell that's the type of way that I hate
You got that fake-friend syndrome
There's no cure so them symptoms is gon' show
You know the code, stick around, hold it down, never fold
Like it's a crease up in your Dicky Browns
Hold up, each one teach one
Motivate each one to be something
Cause I ain't just another statistic
I do this, this, and that if you wanna get specific
I'm just tryna make bread come quicker
For me and my day one hittas

Then it's calls cause the bird's obsessed
Want flowers, cards, and the purses next

Couldn't sell crack but I rap good

Bad bitch with a degree, I let 'em scoop ya

The-these hoes couldn't test me
Even if their name was Pop Quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with
Ma-ma-mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in, like seasoning
And tell them bitches blow me: Lance Stephenson

Yeah, I never fucked Nicki 'cause she got a man
But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought, ""Goddamn, this is the perfect time""
We had just come from that video
You know, L.A. traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt
But I was still staring at the titties though!
Yeah, low-key or maybe high-key
I been peeped that you like me, you know?
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that's right, I like my girls BBW
Yeah, type that wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh! Yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad-ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you
Oh! That's 'cause I believe in something, I stand for it
And Nicki if you ever tryna fuck
Just give me the heads-up, so I can plan for it

I never fucked Nick' and that's fucked up
If I did fuck, she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
'Cause she act like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story-teller
I piss greatness, like goldish yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she waved
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' 'bout runnin' in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, masked up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy, my nigga; I mean brazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the ""b"" off behavior, my nigga
For reals, if you mouth off, I blow your face off
I mean ""pop-pop-pop,"" then I take off
Nigga, now you see me, nigga, now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx acting like Ray Charles
Sixteen in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully with seventeen bullets
My story is how I went from ""poor me""
To ""please pour me a drink and celebrate with me""

Five, four, three, two, I got one shot
You lose the love and respect, that's where the trust stop
New work, top drop
I roll up every fifteen minutes like a bus stop
And you can smell just how I'm smokin' when I burn out
And you can catch me ridin' dirty, but my car not
It's love and loyalty until my heart lock
Never turn your back, won't know how it turned out
I said it once, I'll do it again
I'm playin' the game, I do it to win
With you and your friend, that's thick and thin
That's me and my team, you know we gon' win
You know we gon' ball, you know we gon' ride 'til the wheels fall off

Pressure make a diamond, that pressure made me a star
Got a method to my madness, to bring me down by the bar
People always askin' me how I got this far
My response is just to keep it honest and be who you are
Now they call me Mrs. Money like I'm married to the moolah
Just to measure my success I need at least a hundred rulers

Push it to the edge, I won't back down

We stay up, no bail outs
Give it all, all for the family

They say we are what we are
But we don’t have to be

I’ll be the watcher (watcher)
Of the eternal flame
I’ll be the guard dog
Of all your fever dreams

I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass (glass, glass)

I try to picture me without you but I can’t

Sometimes the only payoff for having any faith
Is when it’s tested again and again everyday
I’m still comparing your past to my future
It might be your wound but they’re my sutures

369,Good Lovin,"[Intro: Miguel]
I keep dwellin' on the past, babe
Know what I need, yeah

[Chorus: Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
It's better to love and then lost than to never have loved at all
If that was true I wouldn't be drinking this alcohol
Every relationship failed to take a toll on you
Especially when you had hoes and area codes on you
Is it easier to erase my memories
At a point when most of my past women became my enemies?
Some on the fence, some befriended me
But when we see each other it's gon' be some weird energy
I'm sorry that we couldn't make it work
Believe in your heart, I never intended to make you hurt
Now they see me on the blogs with my new girl
Friends talking 'bout ""that's supposed to be you, girl""

[Chorus: Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
I got a empty hole in my chest
How do I fill it? Somebody give a prescription
I guess I gotta learn to live with regrets
Pay for mistakes and your exes take a commission
But what's a percent off the top when you hit the bottom
After you break up wondering how to live without 'em?
Need solutions, less problems
Cause if love will drive you crazy I belong in the insane asylum
Hear the rain, feel the pain inside 'em
Kinda lost, need someone to guide 'em
It's nothin' worse than feelin' alone
But I'll admit to feelin' better when I'm hearing this song, it goes

[Chorus: Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

[Bridge: Miguel]
So I, dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat, baby
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
On an empty bed
Dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
While I lose my mind
So you know what I need

[Chorus: Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me",Ludacris,2015,"[97, 91]",2
370,Goodbye,"[Intro]
Goodbye, no use leading with our chins
This is where our story ends
Never lovers, ever friends
Goodbye, let our hearts call it a day
But before you walk away
I sincerely want to say
Goodbye, bye
Goodbye!
Goodbye, bye
Goodbye!

[Chorus]
You told me that I was crazy
'Til I pulled up on your man and you
You looked like the devil when you waved at me
Bitch, I got something to say to you
Goodbye, bye
Goodbye!

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I cracked my windshield, lucky that I didn't crack you
Bitch, you're a black hole, sucking me in your vacuum
Yeah, I cracked my windshield, lucky that I didn't crack you
And I'm feeling drunk in this hotel room trying to ask you
'Bout all of your past dudes and why they stay so present
'Cause bitch if I'm the future, then why they in yo' presence?
And if I'm the king and you the queen
Then why you acting like a peasant?
(Why you acting like a peasant?)
I thought that you were gonna tell all of your exes
Goodbye, bye
(Fucked it all up! Stupid!)
Goodbye!

[Verse 2]
Let me start with Paul, have fun on your farm!
While you counting your chickens
And your goats while you getting dogged
'Cause you think you love Paola
'Cause you went and fucked Paola
But you're just enamored by pussy power
'Cause you never really got it
So when she threw it, yeah, you caught it
And I knew it but I bought it and Paul's just your puppy
Better keep him on your leash
'Cause the second that he finally gets some more pussy he's gon' leave
But round of applause for all the losers like Paul!
(That's just one bum you should've told)
Goodbye, bye
Goodbye!
Goodbye!

[Verse 3]
Yeah, let me name these hoes!
There was Blake, there was Devon, there was Igor, there was Paul
Then I found out you're a prostitute
So there's more names than I recall!
Should've listened to the cops! Should've listened to my pops!
Should've listened to Bugus, man, why did I not?
Because I, I really loved you
Oh, I, I really loved you
But you're a money hungry ho
Guess what I'm saying

[Chorus]
You told me that I was crazy
'Til I pulled up on your man and you
You looked like the devil when you waved at me
Bitch, I got something to say to you
Goodbye (Know you fucked this up!), bye
(And I'ma call you from the Grammies, too!)
Goodbye! (Hopefully you pick up, so I can tell you again)
Goodbye-bye-bye!",Russ,2015,[98],1

372,Night Changes,"[Verse 1: Zayn  & Liam]
Going out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had, she's showing off
Driving too fast, moon is breaking through her hair
She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

[Chorus: Harry]
We’re only getting older, baby
And I’ve been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you’ve ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there’s nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes, it will never change me and you

[Verse 2: Louis & Niall]
Chasing her tonight, doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud and she doesn't want it to stop
Moving too fast, moon is lighting up her skin
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

[Chorus: Harry]
We’re only getting older, baby
And I’ve been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?

Disappearing when you wake up

Even when the night changes, it will never change me and you

Fuck you cause there, there is no right or wrong, only a song

But the only thing like home I've ever known
Until they snatched it from my mama
And foreclosed her on the loan
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone
I was up in New York City chasing panties, getting dome
Had no clue what you was going through
How could you be so strong?
And how could I be so selfish, I know I can be so selfish
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl, damn she so selfless
But she put up with my ways because she loves me like you do
And though it don't always show I love her just like I love you
And I need to treat you better
Wish you could live forever
So we could spend more time together
I love you mama

Shit trump tight never slurred it lazy
Give a virgin the urge to rape me, nigga please

I see you nigga, this ain't no Rolex, it's a AP nigga
I'm hot, dog, catch up to me nigga—uh, couldn't resist
Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed
But I was riding on fumes so I stopped by the moon
Now I'm sitting on the hood of this bitch
Like, ""Thanks for the view"", waiting on thanks from a few
Cause without me you wouldn't exist
You know that shit, gave you the blueprint, don't forget

They said it was coming back around man
Back to the lyrics man
Come back to people like me, I say...

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
It's mean, soldiers
Now let me put the streets down like steamrollers
With the CATS that push
40 oz. through the hood like King Cobras
See we sling soda
Cause the extra four in the split is mixed
It's really thirty-six
Used to buy toasters and clips
You can tighten your circle or boa constrict
While you was lighting your purple, I was over the scripts
See, I could walk the walk, couldn't really talk the talk
Had to get my talk to properly explain my walk
Cause this lack in talk had my walk looking off
Now I'm over the limp
Watch how they mugs drop when they see my Verbal's able
That's the Usual
When I was po' I was low
Now me and my Chaps cop Purple Label
It's Ralph Lauren on the rap laureate
Niggas brown nose, they are like Alf to him
Runners at Interscope are not as Stoute as him
Please don't Interscope
It's gonna be a whole lot of Iovine and respirating
If I lean out this window with Irene
Niggas as tall as Yao Ming
With L-U-P-Emperor
Is the foundation's, I-beams and the antennas
It's so serious every time I write my John Hancock like
Could damn near see Detroit, I see you
Niggas is scared of heights
This is Saran Wrap and aluminum foil
Some potpourri, a little machine oil
I stack my paper and throw off my scents
This is top floor, better look out below
Pennies from heaven is the same as a semi from the second
And I reign supreme
Turn your umbrellas upside down
Did you even catch the change in theme

This is gangsta man

And them niggas ain't Was nor from his regime
Gangsta lean
Hats on tilt like these Snickers ain't drop out the vending machine
You gotta put more money in
And I shake niggas up every time I drop a bar
(2 for 1)
It's horse in the Porsche and bricks in the box
Like mo' money them every time I cop a car
You see I'm a roller, right
So it might be a Rover, right
But every time I drop an 'r'
Get off the streets
It's ""over,"" 'ight
Bet I be in the head like overnight
Like rollers, right
She the chauffeur, right
So I keep her sober
She don't get Fed Ex like overnight
I am Dolemite
All that gas can't help you but solar might
Just call on sun
Drop a 's'
Pick up an 'o'
Uno, put it all on ""one""
Brace yourself like overbite
""For that quiet nigga that relocated down south
Coming back to floss""
Nigga get your molars right
Fix your grill
No plaque but a whole lot of cheese
This the drill
Mr. Chill gave me the green light like Yoda knife
So I'mma force my will
Like the Force I wield
Of course you will
Take my time
But weight behind only pertains
To that Porsche grill
It's snakes in the hood
Gotta watch for that Cobra bite
Let me see
There's snakes in the hood
A bird, a horse behind the grill
Something gator on the seat
And a fox behind the wheel
No it's not Noah's Ark, Ahk
It's just a flower's start

To proceed at all cost

Long live the leader
I remember I ain't have sneakers
It was welfare
Coming up for Airs like
Whales there
Fila, but now I'm well here
I'm Shamu with twelve pair
And niggas wanna take me back to zero like tare fare
Well, my skill's clear

379,Lonely Tonight,"[Verse 1]
I never thought you’d pick up the phone
It's Friday night, you should be out on the town
Didn't think you'd be sittin' at home all alone like me
Nothin' on TV, nothin' to do
Nothin' to keep my mind off you and me
And the way it was
Are you thinkin' 'bout it now because
I could be there in five
One more one last time

[Chorus]
We don't have to be lonely tonight
(I need you, want you, I'm right here)
We don't have to be lonely tonight
(I know we shouldn't, but I don't care)
I don't wanna be right, I don't wanna be strong
I just wanna hold you till the heartbreak's gone
When the sun comes up, we can both move on
But we don't have to be lonely tonight

[Verse 2]
That taste, that touch, the fire I miss
Those kiss me eyes, your red wine lips on mine
Like it used to be
Baby I want you and and you want me and

[Chorus]
We don't have to be lonely tonight
(I need you, want you, I'm right here)
We don't have to be lonely tonight
(I know we shouldn't, but I don't care)
I don't wanna be right, I don't wanna be strong
I just wanna hold you till the heart breaks stone
When the sun comes up, we can both move on
But we don't have to be lonely tonight

[Intro: Action Bronson]
Heartbreak drowned sorrows in a large steak

[Hook: Action Bronson]
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Because you treat me like shit
I paid for the bed and never even slept in it
I paid for that crib I never stepped foot in
And now somebody else is eating all the pudding
Things change, now my dashboard wooden
All black Benz, like a young Doc Gooden
Dark shades, cause I'm stone crazy
Girl, we grown, stop playing on my phone, baby
All your childish attempts to make me angry fall short
Which only fuels the rage you have, because you have nothing
Understandable, I'm shining brilliant with five Brazilians
There were times I used to hide my feelings
Now I'm butt naked in the Lamborghini
And motherfuckers can't see me
Wait 'til this chick see me on TV, I make the shit look easy
Who would've thought I hit you right back?

[Hook: Action Bronson]
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
So many women wanna call me baby
And you wonder why the fuck that I ain't call you lately
Some would say that I'm the symbol for sex and uh
Others would hate, but I don't give 'em no breath
Go on a date, I'm at the crib with the chef and uh, that's me
And you could order whatever
The specialty is white snake and underwear sauce
You could probably catch me somewhere where the sun is next
And I understand that's only cause I'm popular
I'm getting topped off in the front row of the opera
As Bocelli sings the celly rings
I gotta go, you'll never know how good it feels to lay in bed with king
I'm not exactly flawless, but I'm gorgeous, just like a horse is
I know the thought of me succeeding makes a lot of people nauseous
Still I'm on the back of the boat taking pictures with the swordfish

[Hook: Action Bronson]
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
I hope you get a paper cut on your tongue
From a razor in a paper cup
I hope every soda you drink already shaken up
I hope your dreams dry like raisins in the baking sun
I hope your titties all saggy in your early 20's
I hope there's always snow in your driveway
I hope you never get off Fridays
And you work at a Friday's that's always busy on Fridays
I hope you win the lottery and lose your ticket
I hope it's Ben and Socrates poop all up in your kitchen
I hope the zipper on your jacket get stuck
And your headphones short, and your charger don't work
And you spill shit on your shirt
I hope your tears don't hurt, and I can smile in your face
Cut my losses, how Delilah changed my locks to a fade
I hope you happy, I hope you happy
I hope you ruined this shit for a reason, I hope you happy (igh!)

[Hook: Action Bronson]
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?

I knew the minute that I picked you up
It was gonna be a wild ride
You kissed me like you couldn't get enough
Barely made it out of your drive
Burn a little rubber at the red light
Got a little warning from the blue lights
It's only going 9 o'clock but feels more like midnight

And we're just getting started tonight

Girl you already got the window down
And you got your seat laid back
I ain't even made it halfway to town
And you're already talking about a 6 pack
Already got your shoes off
And you talking about slipping off
No we ain't even found your friends saying
You already wanna get lost

Six in the morn', fire in the street
Burn, baby, burn, that's all I wanna see
And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain
It's such a shame they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'
But homie, you made me
Black don't crack, my nigga

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feeling this way since I was 16, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village
Pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm caught in my feelings, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice

I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me inna chains, cah' we black
Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back
But now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the block, jus 'member dat

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society
That's what you're telling me, penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me till I'm dead
Church me with your fake prophesizing that I'ma be just another slave in my head
Institutionalized manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me don't you?
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
Muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah
Black and successful, this black man meant to be special
Katzkins on my radar, bitch, how can I help you?
How can I tell you I'm making a killin'?
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this if you listenin' then sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan
I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius
Excuse my French but fuck you — no, fuck y'all
That's as blunt as it gets, I know you hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, I can tell cause it's threats when I see you
I can tell cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you're in love with that Desert Eagle
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gone bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that want to build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State ""Marcus Garvey got all the answers""
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street
When gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
Hypocrite!

I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets you're walkin' down
I'm fairly local, good people now
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 1]
I'm evil to the core, what I shouldn't do I will
They say I'm emotional, what I want to save I'll kill
Is that who I truly am? I truly don't have a chance
Tomorrow I'll keep a beat an' repeat yesterday's dance

[Pre-Chorus]
Yo, this song will never be on the radio
Even if my clique were to pick an' the people were to vote
It's the few, the proud, an' the emotional
Yo, you, bulletproof in black like a funeral
The world around us is burnin' but we're so cold
It's the few, the proud, an' the emotional

[Chorus]
I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets you're walkin' down
I'm fairly local, good people now
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
I'm not evil to the core, what I shouldn't do I will fight
I know I'm emotional, what I wanna save I will try
I know who I truly am, I truly do have a chance
Tomorrow I'll switch the beat to avoid yesterday's dance

[Pre-Chorus]
Yo, this song will never be on the radio
Even if my clique were to pick an' the people were to vote
It's the few, the proud, an' the emotional
Yo, you, bulletproof in black like a funeral
The world around us is burnin' but we're so cold
It's the few, the proud, an' the emotional

I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets you're walkin' down

I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets (I've seen the streets) you're walkin' down

388,The Heart Wants What It Wants,"[Intro]
What the heart wants
What the heart wants
What the heart wants (Wants, wants, wants)

[Verse 1]
You got me sipping on something
I can't compare to nothing I've ever known
I'm hoping that after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

[Verse 2]
You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

[Bridge]
This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings, no wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

Sometimes you feel insecure
Trust me babe I understand (straight up forreal)

Hakeem got a thing for the ladies
The ladies got a thing for the Hakeem
What I'mma do with you? Damn you so beautiful
How do I get you on my team?
You can be natural with a wig on
Chocolate, Caramel, or a Red bone
So confident, so classy
I should kiss you for the hell of it, no chapstick
Can't help it, I love all women
Big, small, medium, and tall women
Aww man, every one of ya' look good to me
Ain't gotta be a beava' to get wood from me, get it?
Where the hell do ya' come from?
Shot me like a bullet, where did you get a gun from?
Landed on your planet in another dimension
Lookin' at you got me standin' up at attention
You got me goin'

Every nigga is a star, ayy, every nigga is a star
Every nigga is a star, ayy, every nigga is a star
Every nigga is a star, ayy
Who will deny that you and I and every nigga is a star?

[Intro: Josef Leimberg]
Hit me!
When the four corners of this cocoon collide
You’ll slip through the cracks hopin' that you’ll survive
Gather your wit, take a deep look inside
Are you really who they idolize?
To pimp a butterfly

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
At first, I did love you
But now I just wanna fuck
Late nights thinkin' of you
Until I get my nut
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
When I get signed, homie, I'ma act a fool
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
Blue-eyed devil with a fat-ass monkey
I'ma buy a brand new Caddy on vogues
Chunk the hood up, two times, deuce-four
Platinum on everythin', platinum on weddin' ring
Married to the game and a bad bitch chose
When I get signed, homie, I'ma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?
I'ma put the Compton swap meet by the White House
Republican run up, get socked out
Hit the press with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated, but I got a million-dollar check like that

[Refrain: Thundercat & George Clinton]
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home

At first, I did love you (Love you)
But now I just wanna fuck (I just wanna fuck)
Late nights thinkin' of you (Of you)
Until I get my nut ('Til I get my nut)
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board (Across the board)
Destroyed, but what for?

[Break: Dr. Dre]
Yo, what's up? It's Dre
Remember the first time you came out to the house?
You said you wanted a spot like mine
But remember, anybody can get it
The hard part is keepin' it, motherfucker

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
What you want you? A house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anythin', see, my name is Uncle Sam, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I know your kind (That's why I'm kind)
Don't have receipts (Oh, man, that's fine)
Pay me later, wear those gators
Cliché? Then say, ""Fuck your haters""
I can see the baller in you, I can see the dollar in you
Little white lies, but it's no white-collar in you
But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you
Because you make me live forever, baby
Count it all together, baby
Then hit the register and make me feel better, baby
Your horoscope is a gemini, two sides
So you better cop everything two times
Two coupes, two chains, two C-notes
Too much ain't enough, both we know
Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list
Get it all, you deserve it, Kendrick
And when you hit the White House, do you
But remember, you ain't pass economics in school
And everything you buy, taxes will deny
I'll Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-five

[Bridge: George Clinton & Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah, lookin' down, it's quite a drop (It's quite a drop, drop, drop)
Lookin' good when you're on top (When you're on top, you got it)
You got a medal for us
Leavin' metaphors metaphysically in a state of euphoria
Look both ways before you cross my mind

[Refrain: Thundercat & George Clinton]
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home

391,I Lived,"[Verse 1]
Hope when you take that jump
You don't fear the fall
Hope when the water rises
You built a wall
Hope when the crowd screams out
It's screaming your name
Hope if everybody runs
You choose to stay
Hope that you fall in love
And it hurts so bad
The only way you can know
Is give it all you have
And I hope that you don't suffer
But take the pain
Hope when the moment comes
You'll say

I, I did it all
I, I did it all
I owned every second that this world could give
I saw so many places
The things that I did
Yeah, with every broken bone
I swear I lived

Hope that you spend your days
But they all add up
And when that sun goes down
Hope you raise your cup
Oh, oh
I wish that I could witness
All your joy and all your pain
But until my moment comes
I'll say

392,These Walls,"[Produced by Terrace Martin & Larrance Dopson; Additional production by Sounwave]
[Directed by Colin Tilley & The Little Homies]

[Poem: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
Sometimes, I did the same

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
(Woman moaning)
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk-
Sex

[Verse 1: Anna Wise & Kendrick Lamar]
She just want to close her eyes and sway
With you, with you, with you
Exercise her right to work it out
It's true, it's true, it's true
Shout out to the birthday girls
Say hey (Hey), say hey (Hey), (Ah, girl)
Everyone deserves a night to play (Play)
She plays, only when you tell her no

[Chorus: Anna Wise, Thundercat & Bilal]
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
If these walls could talk, they’d tell me to swim good
No boat, I float better than he would
No life jacket, I’m not the God of Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Walls telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me, I’m just a tenant
Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean, it's still amazing, before they couldn’t stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I’m here
These walls never could hold up
Every time I come around, demolition might crush

[Chorus: Anna Wise, Thundercat & Bilal]
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
If these walls could talk, they’d tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously, I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down, that’s my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate, then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don’t know how long I can wait in these walls
I’ve been on the streets too long
Looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song
About how they walls always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must’ve missed them
I’m not involved, I’d rather diss 'em
I’d rather call on you, put your wall up
'Cause when I come around, demolition gon’ crush

[Chorus: Anna Wise, Thundercat & Bilal]
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
If your walls could talk, they’d tell you it’s too late
Your destiny, accept it, your fate
Burn accessories and stash them on the yard
Take the recipe, the Bible and God
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening, no calling CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies to say you're irrepetible, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy the Bull like
A killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
That sentence so important
Walls telling you to listen to Sing About Me
Retaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted same night
So when you play this song, rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently serving life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she fuckin' on a famous rapper
Walls can talk (Talk)

[Poem: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember you was conflicted
Misusin' your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusin' my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in a hotel room",Kendrick Lamar,2015,[94],1
393,Institutionalized,"[Part I]

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
What money got to do with it
When I don't know the full definition of a rap image?
I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I keep runnin' back for a visit, hol' up
Get it back
I said I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I could still kill me a nigga, so what?

[Interlude: Anna Wise & Bilal]
If I was the president
I'd pay my mama's rent
Free my homies and them
Bulletproof my Chevy doors
Lay in the White House and get high, Lord
Whoever thought?
Master, take the chains off me!

Zoom, zoom, zoom

Zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom, shit

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Life to me, like a box of chocolate
Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious
Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it
Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive
I can just alleviate the rap industry politics
Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant
The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious
Me, scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges
Be all you can be, true, but the problem is
Dream only a dream if work don't follow it
Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this
I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal
K Dizzle will do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god
Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually, you're never charged
But somethin' came over you once I took you to them fuckin' BET Awards
You lookin' at artistses like they're harvestses
So many Rollies around you and you want all of them
Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry
I should've listened when my grandmama said to me

[Chorus: Bilal]
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Oh now, slow down

[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]
And once upon a time, in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was five foot something, God bless the kid
Took his homie to the show and this is what they said

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
""Fuck am I 'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks?
The constant big money talk 'bout the mansion and foreign whips
The private jets and passport, presidential glass floor
Gold bottles, gold models, givin' up the ass for
Instagram flicks, suckin' dick, fuck is this?
One more sucker wavin' with a flashy wrist
My defense mechanism tell me to get him
Quickly because he got it
It's a recession, then why the fuck he at King of Diamonds?
No more livin' poor, meet my four-four
When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor
Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers
But it's gon' take a lot 'fore this pistol go cold turkey
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay
But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA
Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor?
Well, that's me at these awards""
I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy
She said...

[Chorus: Bilal]
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Oh now, slow down

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
And once upon a time, in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was five foot something, dazed and confused
Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
You can take your boy out the hood
But you can't take the hood out the homie
Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey
Hollywood's nervous
Fuck you, goodnight, thank you much for your service",Kendrick Lamar,2015,[99],1

Baby, don't you bet it all
On a pack of Fentanyl
You might think they wrote you off
They gon' have to rope me off
Someday the drama'll be gone
And they'll play this song on and on
Sometimes I take all the shine
Talk like I drank all the wine
Years ahead but way behind

You look exactly the same to me
Ain’t no time, crossing your legs inside the diner
Raising your coffee to your lips, the steam

You saw the masterpiece, she looks a lot like you
Wrapping her left arm around your right
Ready to walk you through the night

You whisper to a restless ear, “can you get me out of here?
This place smells like piss and beer, can you get me out?”
You were asking me how to get you free
I only know the recipe to roam

You saw the masterpiece, she looks a lot like you
Wrapping her left arm around your right
Ready to walk you through the night

Old stars filling up my throat
You gave em to me when I was born, now they’re coming out
Laying there on the hospital bed, eyes were narrow, blue and red
You took a draw of breath and said to me

You saw the masterpiece, she looks a lot like me

There’s only so much letting go you can ask someone to do
So I keep you by my side, I will not give you to the tide
I'll even walk you in my stride, Marie

398,What We Ain't Got,"[Verse 1]
We all want what we ain't got
Our favorite doors are always locked
On a higher hill with a taller top
We all want what we ain't got
We ain't happy where we are
There's greener grass in the neighbors yard
A bigger house and a faster car
We ain't happy where we are

She's moving on, but I guess I'm not

When you try your best and it doesn't work

She's moving on, but I guess I'm not

400,New Romantics,"[Verse 1]
We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better
We're so young, but we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb, but we know exactly what we're doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

[Verse 2]
We're all here, the lights and boys are blinding
We hang back, it's all in the timing
It's poker
You can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my Ace (ahh)
We need love, but all we want is danger
We team up, then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But honey, most of them are true

402,Like A Cowboy,"[Verse 1]
When I was six, I had two forty-fives
Strapped to my hips, wanted dead or alive
And all of the kids thought that I was a good guy at heart
When I got to high school, not much really changed
I ran from the cops in my souped-up Mustang
And all of the girls thought that I was a good guy at heart

[Chorus]
And I'd ride like a thief on the run
And I'd hide from the things that I've done
And I'd fly like the wind to the sunset
Just like a cowboy should do
Just like a cowboy should do

[Verse 2]
Girl, I will love you the best that I can
But you need to know that I am what I am
I'm not a bad guy but I'm not a good guy at heart

[Chorus]
And I'll ride like a thief on the run
Say goodbye to the things that I've done
And I'll fly like the wind to the sunset
Just like a cowboy should do
Just like a cowboy should do

Wish I could tell you that I'll always stay
But I can't help that God made me this way
I know that there'll come a day

403,Talladega,"It was the summer before the real world started and
The deal was we would get to go, if we
Cleaned it up, and got it running
Daddy’s old Winnebago

Wing and a prayer down 65
Five best friends on four bald tires
I can still see Billy smiling
When we finally made it

To Talladega
Boys raised up
Whiskey in your glass
Here’s to turning up
Slowing down
And cars that go real fast

We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing
And thinking as that checkered flag was waving
Sure would like to stay in
Talladega

Like a storm, time rolls on
You can’t hit pause, that's just the deal
Most days in life don’t stand out
But life’s about those days that we all like

Rocking Randall
Getting rowdy
Shooting roman candles at the man in the moon
‘til the Alabama sun was breaking

Over Talladega
Boys raised up
Whiskey in your glass
Here’s to turning up
Slowing down
And cars that go real fast

We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing
And thinking as that checked flag was waving
Sure would like to stay in
Talladega

When the winds go cold
And it blows October
I think about us shoulder to shoulder
Like those cars my thoughts roll over and over and over
In my mind

Tonight I’m in Talladega
Boys raised up
Whiskey in your glass
Here’s to turning up
Slowing down
And cars that go real fast

We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing
And thinking as that checked flag was waving
Sure would like to stay in

I'm just gonna walk home kicking stones at parked cars
But I had a great night, 'cause you kept rubbing against my arm
I'm just gonna stand with my bag hanging off my left arm

Get me a drink, I get drunk off one sip just so I can adore you

Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good blood-sucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles all you hear is rumbles

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert

I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Uh, the best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
No matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple double, no assists
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Arguing with my older bitch, acting like I owe her shit
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, ""This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now""
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it ""Malibooyah""
Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit 'em with a new style?
Know that motherfucker well: ""What you gon' do now?""
Whatever I wanna do, gosh! It's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So mommy, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ahh, put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship
I'm living in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass

None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles, I
Kill the block, I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles' heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and blood-suckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Milling about, spilling they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up

Then I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs

Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent

Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really, really I don't give a F-U-C-K
""Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki 'cause she's fake""
""She on a diet,"" but my pockets eating cheesecake
And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's Child's Play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, 'Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Am should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Aaaah, I'm a motherfucking monster!

409,Glory,"[Chorus]
The most amazing feeling I feel
Words can't describe the feeling, for real
Baby, I paint the sky blue
My greatest creation was you, you: Glory

[Verse 1]
False alarms and false starts
All made better by the sound of your heart
All the pain of the last time
I prayed so hard it was the last time
Your mama said that you danced for her
Did you wiggle your hands for her?
Glory! Glory!
Glory! Sorry
Everything that I prayed for
God's gift, I wish I woulda prayed more
God makes no mistakes, I made a few
Rough sledding here and there, but I made it through
I wreak havoc on the world
Get ready for part two
A younger, smarter, faster me
So a pinch of Hov, a whole glass of Bey

[Chorus]
The most amazing feeling I feel
Words can't describe the feeling, for real
Baby, I paint the sky blue
My greatest creation was you, you: Glory

[Verse 2]
Your Grandpop died of nigga failure
Then he died of liver failure
Deep down he was a good man
Goddamn, I can't deliver failure
Bad-ass lil Hov
Two years old, shopping on Savile Row
Wicked-ass lil B
Hard not to spoil you rotten, looking like little me
The most beautifulest thing in this world
Is daddy's little girl
You don't yet know what swag is but you was made in Paris
And Mama woke up the next day and shot her album package
Last time the miscarriage was so tragic
We was afraid you'd disappear, but nah, baby, you magic (Voilà!)
So there you have it, shit happens
Just make sure the plane you on is bigger than your carry-on baggage
Everybody go through stuff
Life is a gift, love, open it up
You're a child of destiny
You're the child of my destiny
You're my child with the child from Destiny's Child
That's a hell of a recipe
Glory! Glory!
Glory! Sorry

[Chorus]
The most amazing feeling I feel
Words can't describe the feeling, for real
Baby, I paint the sky blue

Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it

Infatuated by the fame status
She wanna ride inside the G-Class grey 'matic
I come around, she leave that nigga like he ain't matter
That girl been drinkin' all day, need to change bladder

She 'bout to go downtown for a whole hour
If I had her, you can have her, man it don't matter
I'm never sour, I'm just smokin' somethin' much louder

People sayin' I'm the closest thing to Mike since Janet, whuh!
Tom Cruise, homie, we jumpin' up on them couches
That's a fresh house, is that a guest house?
Your house got another house?
Your bitch got a bitch, your spouse got another spouse
Young Walt Disney, I'ma tell you truthfully
If you leave Mickey you gon' end up with a Goofy
I imagine that's what Chris told Karrueche
Girls be actin' like it's diamonds in they coochie
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
But cops chokin' niggas out in the media
We finna have to protest and tear the city up
We 'bout to tear this whole place up, pretty much
(How much I live)

And you know it's all your fault
Nobody, nobody, nobody, babe
You know it's all your fault

I'm wonderin', ""How do I get to the rafters?""
Oh boy, I'm mad until these records gettin' shattered
'Til I'm MJ or Magic, ooh, and she just want the status
So, you the man she got, but I'm the man that she been after
She done sent so many naked pics, my phone ain't got no data
I walk off in New York like my name Derek Jeter
Headed home to the D where you know I keep a Gina (Gina!)
I'm the good with the evil; fuck you, nice to meet you
You can't have a peace sign, man, without the middle finger
With the clique when you see us, that's my family to me
That's my family tree, they're my arms, legs, hands, and my feet
And I can't cut them off with even diabetes
Hit the beat and kerosene it; scratch that, I white sheet it
A 100 dollar fade every single time you see us
Been a king all my life so I shoulda got a Caesar
Somewhere off in Vegas rollin' dice up at the Caesar's
Got me thinkin' back bout how I used to roll to Little Caesars
Piece of pizza with Tanisha now I'm with a Boniqua
She finna blow at that
I got your dream girl, yeah, she actin' like a hoe at that
Throw her to me, I'ma throw that back
Top spot, I'm finna go at that (Straight up)

Hoe, you gotta move quick
World in my hands, I ain't gotta loose grip
I don't like loose pussy or loose lips
And I done did the impossible a few times, Tom Cruise shit
Hoe, and I ain't satisfied bein' on that top five list
I ain't satisfied until I'm on that all-time list
Til everything I spit is all timeless
My girl on that all fine list
My life a little luck, a lot of grind, bitch!
No ""maybe,"" hoe, I gotta make it
Fuck your nomination; man, fuck the world
I'm repopulatin', wrap my Rollie round my waist
Yeah, time's a-wastin'
Niggas want the comma-comma-combination
Long as I'm around, it's gon' be dot-dot-dot, a lot of waitin'
Got my pinky on her brain while I'm gettin' brain
Plottin' world domination, people ask me how to make it
I'm just like ""man, if you want the crown, bitch, you gotta take it""

One look, dark room
Meant just for you
Time moved too fast, you play it back
Buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke
No proof, not much, but you saw enough
Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight
The light reflects the chain on your neck
He says, ""Look up""
And your shoulders brush
No proof, not much, but you felt enough

[Chorus]
You can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (lights out), lights out (lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love

[Verse 2]
Morning, his place
Burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt, he keeps his word
And for once, you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much, but it said enough
You kiss on sidewalks
You fight and you talk
One night, he wakes
Strange look on his face
Pauses, then says ""You're my best friend""
And you knew what it was, he is in love

[Chorus]
You can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (lights out), lights out (lights out)
You are in love, true love

[Bridge]
And so it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe, 'round and 'round
And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
And you understand now
Why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words

[Breakdown]
'Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love

[Chorus]
You can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (lights out), lights out (lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love
You can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home), you

Hello 'Mari, how ya doin'?
I think the storm ran out of rain, the clouds are movin'
I know you're happy, cause I can see it
So tell the voice inside ya head to believe it
I talked to God about you, he said he sent you an angel
And look at all that he gave you
You asked for one and you got two
You know I never left you
Cause every road that leads to heaven's right inside you
So I can say

Hello, my only one, just like the mornin' sun
You'll keep on risin' 'til the sky knows your name
Hello my only one, remember who you are

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh, the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day
Remember how I'd say
Hey hey one day, you'll be the man you always knew you could be
And if you knew how proud I was
You'd never shed a tear, have a fear, no you wouldn't do that
And though I didn't pick the day to turn the page
I know it's not the end every time I see her face, and I hear you say

Hello my only one, remember who you are
You got the world cause you got love in your hands
And you're still my chosen one
So can you understand? One day you'll understand

We'll have wings and we'll fly

Till we crash up the whole database
I bring it home like I'm base to base to base
Closet lookin' like Planet of the Bathing Apes
What you think this life just landed on me?
My whole city look like it's abandoned, homie
And we came straight out of those abandoned homes
Every wish we ever had got granted, homie
And I'll never take that shit for granted
Even when the marble floor and counter top is all granite
Back before I got paid any advances
Back when my rollie was ticking, no dancing
Nigga, never did I slip or I panic
Even if I was the captain of Titanic
Riding through the north Atlantic, homie

I hit the booth and I just went Super Saiyan
I run with the purp like I play with the Ravens
These bitches rant and rave
I hope I never have to go back watching
Everybody Loves Raymond

Nobody flippin' packs now

Put the world on our sound
You know PARTY and The Weeknd
Ain't got no motherfuckin' time
To party on the weekend
Tell Gelo bring the juice
We about to get lit
Fill the room up with some tings
One night off and this is it
Always workin' OT
Overtime and out of town
Shit is crazy back home
It kills me that I'm not around
I think we gettin' too deep
Shit I'm talkin' might be too true
Upstairs I got Xans in an Advil bottle
I don't take them shits but you do
So I got 'em for you
I don't need the pills
I'm just gon' have another drink
And when I'm puttin' work in on a weekend
I'll look back on this and think
How we had the club going up

Workin' Monday night
On the corner flippin' hard
Made at least three thousand
On the boulevard
I've been workin' graveyard
Shifts every other weekend
Ain't got no fuckin' time
To party on the weekend
I've been flippin' in the house
Makin' juggs on the highway
I've been ridin' out of state
Makin' money like my way
I don't think that I should dance
I'm just gon' have another drink
I'm doin' my stance
You know my molly pink
I got the loudest of the loud
You know my gas stink
My P.O. think I'm in the house
Don't give a damn 'bout what she think

I made my own style
I don't think that I should stay
You know I gotta go
Been moving too fast
Don't wanna take it slow

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I eat my dinner in my bathtub, then I go to sex clubs
Watchin' freaky people gettin' it on
It doesn't make me nervous if anything, I'm restless
Yeah, I've been around and I've seen it all
I get home, I got the munchies, binge on all my Twinkies
Throw up in the tub, then I go to sleep
And I drank up all my money, dazed and kinda lonely

[Chorus]
You're gone and I gotta stay high
All the time, to keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
High, all the time, to keep you off my mind

Spend my days locked in a haze, tryna forget you, babe
I fall back down (Back down)
Gotta stay high, all my life, to forget I'm missin' you
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Pick up daddies at the playground, how I spend my day time
Loosen up their frown, make 'em feel alive

421,Wonderland,"[Verse 1]
Flashing lights, and we
Took a wrong turn, and we
Fell down a rabbit hole
You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems
And spinning out of control

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?
Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twistin' around me
I should have slept with one eye open at night

[Chorus]
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (ey, ey)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better (ey, ey)
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
In Wonderland
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
In Wonderland
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
In Wonderland
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
In Wonderland

[Verse 2]
So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone, or so it seemed
But there was strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams, oh

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?
Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twistin' around me
It's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind
But darlin'

[Chorus]
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (ey, ey)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better (ey, ey)
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
In Wonderland
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
In Wonderland
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
In Wonderland
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
Whoa, in Wonderland

[Bridge]
I reached for you, but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You searched the world for something else
To make you feel like what we had
And in the end, in Wonderland
We both went mad
Oh

[Chorus]
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
Last forever (ey, ey)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it (got lost in it)
And life was never worse but never better
Never better (ey, ey)
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
And we pretended it could last forever (in Wonderland)
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
(Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey)
And life was never worse but never better

We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again

When you get to where the fuck I'm at

Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone

Lord, tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em
I ain't got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence

Let's take it on back to the river
With that muddy water beat
Let's take it on back to that old soul
Let it all wash all over me

Maybe we can just pretend that we're right back there again
Yeah, put on that track
Let's take it on back

426,What Kind Of Man,"[Verse 1]
I was on a heavy tip
Trying to cross a canyon with a broken limb
You were on the other side, like always
Wondering what to do with life

[Verse 2]
I'd already had a sip
So I'd reasoned I was drunk enough to deal with it
You were on the other side, like always
You could never make your mind

[Pre-Chorus]
And with one kiss
You inspired a fire of devotion that lasts for twenty years
What kind of man loves like this?

[Verse 3]
To let me dangle at a cruel angle
Oh, my feet don't touch the floor
Sometimes you're half in and then you're half out
But you never close the door

[Chorus]
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?

[Verse 4]
You're a holy fool, all coloured blue
Red feet upon the floor
You do such damage, how do you manage?
To have me crawling back for more

[Pre-Chorus]
And with one kiss
And with one kiss
You inspired a fire of devotion that lasts for twenty years
For twenty years
What kind of man loves like this?

[Chorus]
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?

[Verse 5]
But I can't beat ya, 'cause I'm still with ya
""Oh mercy"", I implore
""Oh mercy"", I implore
How do you do it? I think I'm through it
Then I'm back against the wall
Back, back, back against the wall

What kind of man loves like this?
What kind of man?
What kind of man loves like this?

Baby, you got a body like a Benz
And I'm just trying to drive it once again

[Verse 1: Wale]
Shawty, can I fill your tank, yeah?
I start off with that, ""what you drinkin'?""
Pardon if I'm road raging
But I know you heard my drive is crazy
Yeah, let me pace that with some patience
Let me do it till I fill every void
You're like a Maybach, thinking damn
They ain't even make 'em like you no more
It's like a high beam gleaming through your eye (bling)
I adore you up, baby suicide
A little wordplay, I'm hoping I can make you smile
Least until I'm out of line like a DUI
Girl, you remind me of my Jeep
Can I see what's up with that G-Wagon?
Can I take you off of these streets?
To the side of me, I'm trying to see your hazards
Trying to be with the baddest, won't be the fastest
Gotta make it last, I hope you comfortable
I need to get to you, you're like a '62
A little work then it's curtains when I'm skrrting through
Came through in the group, trying to leave in the coupe
That mean I gots a few, but I believe in you
Trying to chase the cat, know I'm killing it, dawg
You ain't feeling me naw, that mean I don't need the roof

[Bridge: Jeremih & Wale]
You remind me of my Jeep, I wanna ride it
You something like my car
I got the keys to them, I need the keys to you

A good woman is scarce to us
And I wasn't prepared to love
I know it sound crazy, but your miles scare me
I'm just here cause your character good (truth be told)
A good nigga is rare to her (truth be told)
You heard it all, but hear this love
One night with dude, I be the reason you cool
So let me know am I clear enough, yeah, what's up?
Way I, way I, that's the way I think
Shawty straight like a concept on Bayonne Street
In the morning I slide over, she needs a ride I'm like
""Tight, let's keep it AMG""
Sliding down, precipitating is straight
Top down, let me kiss your physique
I'm digging your fleek, I'm checkin' your gear
Can tell you had a good year, spent a grip on your feet
She like when I drive it, I like it in park
Pull that thing over you likely to sore
I got her floating like riding on stars
So I keep it GPS, see where this going
Nothing will stop it, I slide in no prob
Ch-ch-chop it, my swipe your parts
Sex is her weapon, my snake in her garden
So know when I'm not here the viper is on

Or move as far as sold Michael Jackson 43 million
Shoot, errbody have the zipper jacket
And half of these thugs have the glove to match, ya feel me?
Yo, it's ok though, if you wanna be hard and ice grill
And Harlem Shake at the same time, whatever

She would not show that she was afraid
But being and feeling alone was too much to face
Though everyone said that she was so strong
What they didn't know is that she could barely carry on

[Pre-Chorus]
But she knew that she would be okay
So she didn't let it get in her way

Sometimes, it all gets a little too much
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much

She would always tell herself, she could do this
She would use no help it would be just fine

445,Hotel,"[Verse 1: Don Henley]
On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
""This could be Heaven or this could be Hell""
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

[Chorus: Don Henley]
""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here""

[Verse 2: Don Henley]
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes Benz
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
She calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain
""Please bring me my wine""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here since 1969""
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

[Chorus: Don Henley]
""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They living it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis""

[Verse 3: Don Henley]
Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said: ""We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device""
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
""Relax,"" said the night man
""We are programmed to receive

But you can never leave!""

[Part 2: ***Flawless]

[Intro: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]
We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: ""You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man""
Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices
Always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important
Now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage
And we don't teach boys the same?
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are
Feminist: a person who believes in the social, political
And economic equality of the sexes

[Chorus: Beyonce]
You wake up, flawless
Post up, flawless
Ridin' 'round in it, flawless

450,All About It,"[Intro: Ed Sheeran]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, no oh-oh-oh-oh
Said I'm all about it

[Hook: Hoodie Allen]
Cause I got soul and I won't quit
And your dad don't like it when I talk my shit
Cause I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby
Staying up late just to pass the time
And your parents don’t like it when you out getting high
But I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
I'm not a rapper just a singer with a game plan
I play guitar no need to worry 'bout my Drake hand
80,000 people in front of the stage, damn
Waiting for the sun to shine just to rock these Ray Bans
I just wanna leak shit (what?)
Not literally leak shit
Wanna push the music through the speakers
Double shot glass, I'm in the back of the pub
My mate Jason at the bar screaming ""Who want what?""
Now, please be warned
That every song I feature on has capacity to be reborn
I said that anything can happen when I pick up a pen
But now I'm all about love so won't you say it again
I said I used to be the shy type
Backpack on my back on public transport sort of guy type
Now I'm in the limelight
Tryna get my mind right
Body clock is in the clouds so often guess it's high time
Hoodie sing the line like

[Hook: Hoodie Allen]
Cause I got soul and I won't quit
And your dad don't like it when I talk my shit
Cause I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby
Staying up late just to pass the time
And your parents don’t like it when you out getting high
But I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby

[Verse 2: Hoodie Allen]
I'm not a singer, I just rap pretty
So now my fan base is full of Megan's and Ashley's
And they're wondering if there's room for them to get in my bus
And I'm like, ""Naturally, baby, let me find a spot in the front""
For you, and for your friends
You can be mine, we can pretend
Oh, typical rapper actin' a typical fashion
I'm doing something that's different
I'm tryin' to Paula my patent
The young prince of Manhattan, now everybody believe it
Adrien Broner the way I'm ducking and weaving
We go together like interceptions and Revis
She said the only rapper she lovin' is Yeezus

[Bridge]
One for the money
Two people since the beginning
Three million records get sold and now everybody is winning
I'm Larry David plus Miles Davis
So, everybody hating and fuck it, I hardly blame 'em

[Hook: Hoodie Allen]
Cause I got soul and I won't quit
And your dad don't like it when I talk my shit
Cause I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby

And your parents don’t like it when you out getting high
But I'm all about it baby

This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play, then somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something, liking to loving
It was us against the world, and now we just fucking?
It's like I loved you so much, and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us, ain't no place in between
Might, might be me believing what you say that you'll never mean
Like it'll last forever, but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You were different from my last, but now you got 'em mirrored
And as it all plays out, I see it couldn't be clearer
Now sing

Just to get you, I'm doing whatever works

I'ma make you beg for it, plead for it
'Til you feel like you breathe for it
'Til you'll do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it, wake up and dream for it
'Til it's got you gasping for air and you lean forward
'Til they have a CAT scan to check on your mind
And it's nothing but me, on it (On it, on it)
Now it's me time, believe that
If it's yours and you want it, I want it, promise I need that

'Cause this here is fatal attraction, so I take it all or I don't want shhh

Gripping you up, fucking and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do?
I know you ain't getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are I hope you have a good time
'Cause I definitely be having mine
And you ain't finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear bout other niggas is strokin' you
Lying, say I hit you, he sitting there consoling you
Runnin' my name through the mud, who's provoking you?
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you
1 AM and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm calling your brother's phone, like, what was I supposed to do?
Even though I knew, he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point, I had to stop asking questions
Y'all got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money
That ain't right, girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said, ""Yeezy, I ain't your right girl
You'll probably find one of them 'I like art'-type girls""
""All of the lights,"" she was caught in the hype, girl
And I was satisfied being in love with a lie
Now who to blame? You to blame?
Me to blame? For the pain
And it poured every time when it rained
Let's play the blame game

[Chorus: John Legend]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure

[Interlude: Kanye West]
""Things used to be, now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing?
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely""
[—Chloe Mitchell]

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more
Let's call out names, names, for sure

[Bridge: Kanye West]
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, no, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much

[Outro: Kanye West]
And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called it just ring and ring
You ain't pick up but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing
I heard the whole thing, the whole thing, the whole thing

[""The Best Birthday"": Chris Rock & Salma Kenas]

'Bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and, um (yeah!)
Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit
And start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
From the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd (yeah)
You can see the sparks from hot metal (yeah)
Cold-hearted, from the day I Bogarted
The game, my soul started to rot, fellow (yeah)
When I'm not even in my harshest
You can still get roasted, ‘cause Marsh is not mellow
'Til I'm topplin' from the top, I'm not gonna stop
I'm standin' on my Monopoly board (uh)
That means I'm on top of my game
And it don't stop 'til my hip don't hop anymore (shit)
When you're so good that you can't say it
‘Cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore (shit)
People just get sick ‘cause you spit
These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore (ow!)
And you can never break my stride (nope)
You'll never slow the momentum at any moment
I'm 'bout to blow, you'll never take my pride
Killin' the flow, slow venom
And the opponent is gettin' no mercy, mark my words
Ain't lettin' up, relentless, I smell blood
I don't give a fuck, keep givin' them hell
Where was you when I fell and needed help up?
You get no love

But in my mind, we're somewhere in my car
And it's raining hard on the streetlight glow
You got your lips on mine, it's gasoline on fire
I never will forget
You grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
And your fingertips slide up and down my back
Breathin' hard, steamin' up the glass
I'd give anything if I could bring it back, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
So, I've been sleeping til noon in the same bedroom
Where I once held you and it's breaking my heart
I should take down all those pictures from my wall
Promises we made won't fill this empty space

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, oh, oh, and I don't know why I just can't let you go
Ooh, oh, oh, I know you're never coming back

But in my mind, we're somewhere in my car
And it's raining hard on the streetlight glow
You got your lips on mine, it's gasoline on fire
I never will forget
You grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
And your fingertips slide up and down my back
Breathin' hard, steamin' up the glass
I'd give anything if I could bring it back oh oh
But in my mind, we're somewhere in my car
And it's raining hard on the streetlight glow
You got your lips on mine, it's gasoline on fire

You grabbed my shirt and pulled it over my head
And your fingertips slide up and down my back

Bitch you something so serious
It's recording?
(They say diamonds are forever)
(They say diamonds are forever)

[Verse 1:]
Public thought me a pessimist think my thoughts too pessimistic
Reminiscing
Roastin' Garcia Vegas, just don't do swishers or rillas
Murder rap, we beat it 2am and two-seated
Yellow things bright embrace, I arch it back and lay
Face down, I'm a gangsta my heart colder than Chicago
This black Impala just sent bullets through my car door
These niggas I've been runnin' wit' pressure hit they crumblin'
Never had no love in this shit, pray to God, somebody pray for me
Deep conversation was always elated and then celebrated the things of the past
Happy belated, while handing her Franklins, just thought I was stated, but stated too fast
Went to the pen, and was living upstate but feel I got away cause I skated with cash
Made crooked lawyers and dirty attorneys, who take all your money and say that they working
Fucking with you, stuck in this loop you jumping through hoops and we running through hurdles
Ain't meet ya momma but I told her I promise that when she around me nothing will hurt her
She do the talking I can't be too personal, lean drinking, no Bud Light
Itching for them chickens them idiots must don't love life

[Hook]
Free to speak on anything at all
Before we met, not much belief in
Anything at all
And then we found love under neon lights
Fluorescent body paint
While under neon lights
Lemme get you to sound off, loud in here
But say my name, loud and clear
Watch we wake up all the neighbors when we makin' love
I'm talking naked, making faces, really cuttin' up
In the bathroom, or the shower let this water fall
Like Soulja Slim I got enough dick for all of y'all
Now the luxury whips come equipped with neon lights
Body paint fluorescent under neon lights
Fuck what he don't like, we gon' be alright
Cookin' soft and selling hard while under neon lights

[Verse 2]
Bread Winner Mafia ? we poppin' in climates with tropical leaves
Take off my shirt can't come out my sleeves I got it in ink then it's what I believe
Exploring desires this moment devours I'm watching this fire ignite in the sheets
Kissing my wrist, got her legs on my shoulder my dick in her stomach I'm giving her ""D""
She, grippin' the pillow with teeth, I wrinkle my lip she wiggles her feet
Built up a tolerance now while inside of it hollerin louder she get it with speed
This is we. They say diamonds are forever
Boyfriend called her and cussed her out (I'm forreal girl, I'm forreal girl)
Cling on got the theme song on my ringtone I'mma beef with you everytime you leave home
Tell em that the plan that I'll have you scared better tell em I'll catch em I'll tell em whatever what up
Name in the streets and I stand on that spit my life through the wax I'mma die bout that
Outside make it 4th of July bout that
And they say diamonds are forever (I'm forreal girl, I'm forreal)
From start to finish Go-Karts Assembled sayin life's but a race put the petal to the metal
Sayin ready, set, go now start ya engine
On a 90-day run we thought was different
We still keep in touch no loss in feelings but a understanding

Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit
Bi-big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bo-bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first? I had them pushing daffodils

He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills and he tellin' me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab

He toss my salad like his name Romaine
And when we done, I make him buy me Balmain
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills, and he telling me to chill

Cause it’s my heart that’s been missing you
And it’s the heart I need to listen to
And it’s been singing songs for tender dreams
The one's you sang to help us sleep
And one day I will sing those songs
Sing them ‘till they sleep
Just like you sang to me
Just like you sang, sang to me

I miss you so, I miss you so
And I’ll miss you ‘till i’m old
I miss you so, I miss you so
But my fears will fade, I know
‘cause it’s my heart that you helped to build
And love is my compass still yeah
Love will fill the holes I’ve got
‘cause you will never hold me
But I know that you are with me, and I know that you're in peace
Cause you let us sing to sleep
You let us sing your heart to sleep

From the day that I met you I stopped feeling afraid
In your arms I feel safe
In your arms I feel safe
From the day that I met you I stopped feeling afraid
In your arms I feel safe
In your arms I feel safe

I ain't got nowhere to run
Sleeping in this bed of lies
I ain't got nowhere to go
I ain't got nowhere to hide
I ain't got nowhere to run
Sleeping in this bed of lies

[Verse 1]
Yeah, Iv'e been lying to the ones i love
I've been lying to the lord up above
Sorry god I don't deserve to go to heaven
I've been around to many drugs
I told way to many lies
I've been with too many sluts
I fucked up too many times
Like way way more then once
I ain't never learn my lesson
I just keep on fucking up
God please send me a message
My heart is running out of love
I've been drinking heavily
Like way way more then i used to
Sorry god i'm ignoring what your'e telling me
I really hope that i don't lose you

I ain't got nowhere to run
Sleeping in this bed of lies
I ain't got nowhere to go
I ain't got nowhere to hide
I ain't got nowhere to run
Sleeping in this bed of lies

[Verse 2]
Forget race or religion
I just want to be forgiven
For knowingly and unknowingly all the sins i've committed
I've got a lot on my conscious, i let it out
I've considered all the options, but when in doubt
I just turn to all my guilty pleasures instead of you
Desperate times call for desperate measures, that's my excuse
I'm wasting valuable seconds and neglected what's important
I've been blinded by the fame and the money
I got lost in a world full of cloths and the drugs, cars in the bucks, hoes in the club, what the fuck
It was everything i thought i wanted, still kinda is
Prayed for all the wrong things and got them, I wish i didn't
I wish i spent more time with my grandpa before he passed
Instead i was rolling up blunts and chasing ass
Spending all my cash while the medical bills pile up
All the while my momma ain't even smile once

[Chores]
I ain't got nowhere to go
I ain't got nowhere to hide
I ain't got nowhere to run
Sleeping in this bed of lies
I ain't got nowhere to go

476,Yellow Flicker Beat,"[Produced by Paul Epworth]
[Written by Lorde and Joel Little]

[Verse 1]
I'm a princess cut from marble, smoother than a storm
And the scars that mark my body, they're silver and gold
My blood is a flood of rubies, precious stones
It keeps my veins hot, the fire's found a home in me
I move through town, I’m quiet like a fight
And my necklace is of rope, I tie it and untie it

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And now people talk to me, but nothing ever hits home
People talk to me, and all the voices just burn holes
I’m done with it (ooh)

[Chorus]
This is the start of how it all ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
We’re at the start, the colors disappear
I never watch the stars, there’s so much down here
So I just try to keep up with them
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart

[Verse 2]
I dream all year, but they're not the sweet kinds
And the shivers move down my shoulder blades in double time

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And now people talk to me I'm slipping out of reach now
People talk to me, and all their faces blur
But I got my fingers laced together and I made a little prison
And I'm locking up everyone who ever laid a finger on me
I’m done with it (ooh)

[Chorus]
This is the start of how it all ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
We’re at the start, the colors disappear
I never watch the stars, there’s so much down here
So I just try to keep up with them
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 1]
Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
""Let It Snow"" is blasting out
But I won't get it in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

[Chorus]
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Verse 2]
I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's

[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

[Chorus]
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

[Bridge]
Oh, I wanna have him beside me, like oh-woo-oh
On the 25th, by that fireplace, oh-woo-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh, baby
(Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)
If he will be, if he will be here
(Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)
Oh, woah

[Chorus]
Santa, tell me (Santa, tell me) if you're really there ('Cause I really care)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year

I'm asking everyone
Knocking down doors and I'm pounding the pavement
Lie at your mercy, will somebody save me? Save me?

Has anybody seen all my wasted love?
I've been down every street, no, I won't give up
If I have to die let me testify, that's how it's gonna be

488,Lost Without U,"[Chorus]
I'm lost without you, can't help myself
How does it feel to know that I love you, baby?
I'm lost without you, can't help myself
How does it feel to know that I love you, baby?

[Verse 1]
Tell me how you love me more
And how you think I'm sexy, baby
That you don't want nobody else
You don't want this guy, you don't want that guy
You wanna touch yourself when you see me
Tell me how you love my body
And how I make you feel, baby
You wanna roll with me, you wanna hold with me
You wanna stay warm and get out of the cold with me
I just love to hear you say it
It makes a man feel good, baby
Tell me you depend on it, I need to hear it

[Chorus]
I'm lost without you, can't help myself
How does it feel to know that I love you, baby?
I'm lost without you, can't help myself
How does it feel to know that I love you, baby?

[Verse 2]
Baby, you're the perfect shape
Baby, you're the perfect weight
Treat me like my birthday
I want it this way, I want it that way, I want it
Tell me you don't want me to stop (Don't stop)
Tell me it would break your heart
But you love me and all my dirty
You wanna roll with me, you wanna hold with me
You wanna make fires and get Norwegian wood with me
I just love to hear you say it
It makes a man feel good, baby

I'm lost without you, can't help myself
How does it feel to know that I love you baby?
I'm lost without you, can't help myself
How does it feel to know that I love you, baby?

Ooh, alright, baby
Oh, yeah, oh, baby
Oh, darling, alright

489,Soldier,"[Intro]
I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier (la-de-dah-dah, dah-dah, dah-dah)
I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier
Yo...

[Verse 1]
Never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Never was a gangsta 'til I graduated to one
And got the rep of a villain, for weapon concealing
Took the image of a thug, kept shit appealing
Willing to stick out my neck for respect, if it meant
Life or death, never live to regret what I said
When you're me, people just wanna see if it's true
If it's you—what you say in your raps, what you do
So they feel it's part of your obligation to fulfill
When they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real?
In confrontation, ain't no conversation, if you feel
You're in violation, any hesitation'll get you killed
If you feel it, kill it; if you conceal it, reveal it
Being reasonable'll leave you full of bullets, pull it
Squeeze it 'til it's empty; tempt me, push me, pussies
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze

[Chorus]
(I'm a soldier) These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier) Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
(I'm a soldier) These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier) Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never stumble

[Verse 2]
I love pissing you off, gets me off
Like my lawyers when the fuckin' judge lets me off
All you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off
I'll violate and all the motherfucking bets be off
I'm a lit fuse, anything I do, bitch, it's news
Pistol-whippin' motherfucking bouncers 6'2""
Who needs bullets? As soon as I pull it, you sweat bullets
An excellent method to get rid of the next bully
It's actually better 'cause instead of you murderin'
You can hurt 'em and come back again and kick dirt at 'em
It's like pouring salt in the wounds, assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room
Everybody halts and stops, calls the cops
All you see is bitches coming out their halter tops
Running and ducking out the Hot Rocks parking lot
You'll all get shot, whether it's your fault or not, 'cause I'm a—

[Chorus]
(I'm a soldier) These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier) Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
(I'm a soldier) These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier) Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never stumble

[Verse 3]
I spit it slow so these kids know that I'm talking to 'em
Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em
I'm like a thug with a little bit of Pac influence
I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rocking to it
You motherfuckers could never do it like I could do it
Don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
Don't ever in your life try to knock the truest
I spit the illest shit ever been dropped in two-inch
So ticky-tock, listen as the sound ticks on the clock
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on a cock
Listen to the sound of me spilling my heart through this pen
Motherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again
Full of controversy until I retire my jersey
'Til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty
And Lord, have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me
And put a curse on authorities, in the face of adversity, I'm a—

[Chorus]
(I'm a soldier) These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier) Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
(I'm a soldier) These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
(I'm a soldier) Even if my collarbones crush or crumble
I will never stumble

490,Lost Stars,"[Verse 1]
Please don't see just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies
Please see me reachin' out for someone I can't see

[Pre-Chorus]
Take my hand, let's see where we wake up tomorrow
Best laid plans sometimes are just a one night stand
I'll be damned, Cupid's demandin' back his arrow
So let's get drunk on our tears and

[Chorus]
God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning, but are we all lost stars
Trying to light up the dark?

[Verse 2]
Who are we? Just a speck of dust within the galaxy
Woe is me if we're not careful turns into reality
Don't you dare let our best memories bring you sorrow

[Pre-Chorus]
Yesterday I saw a lion kiss a deer
Turn the page maybe we'll find a brand new ending
Where we're dancing in our tears and

[Chorus]
God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning, but are we all lost stars
Trying to light up the dark?

[Bridge]
I thought I saw you out there crying, ooh
And I thought I heard you call my name, yeah
And I thought I heard you out there crying, oh
Just the same, oh, yeah

[Chorus]
God, give us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and this lamb is on the run
Searching for meaning, but are we all lost stars?
I try to light up your dark

[Bridge]
I thought I saw you out there crying, ooh
And I thought I heard you call my name, yeah
And I thought I heard you out there crying, oh

But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?

491,Girl In A Country Song,"[Intro]
No country music was harmed in the making of this song
This is only a test-t-t

[Verse 1]
Well, I wish I had some shoes on my two bare feet
And it's getting kinda cold in these painted on cut-off jeans
I hate the way this bikini top chafes
Do I really have to wear it all day? (Yeah, baby)

[Verse 2]
I hear you over there on your tailgate whistlin' [whistle]
Sayin', ""Hey, girl"" (Hey, girl)
But you know I ain't listenin'
'Cause I got a name
And to you, it ain't ""Pretty little thing""
""Hottie"" or ""Baby""
It's driving me red-red-red-red-red-red-redneck crazy

[Chorus]
Being the girl in a country song
How in the world did it go so wrong?
Like all I'm good for is lookin' good for
You and your friends on the weekend, nothin' more
We used to get a little respect
Now we're lucky if we even get
To climb up in your truck, keep our mouths shut, and ride along
And be the girl in a country song

[Verse 2]
Well, shakin' my moneymaker ain't never made me a dime
And there ain't no sugar for you in this shaker of mine
Tell me one more time ""You gotta get you some of that""
Sure, I'll slide on over, but you're gonna get slapped (Ha)
These days, it ain't easy bein' that

[Chorus]
Girl in a country song
How in the world did it go so wrong?
Like all I'm good for is lookin' good for
You and your friends on the weekend, nothin' more
We used to get a little respect
Now we're lucky if we even get
To climb up in your truck, keep our mouths shut, and ride along
And be the girl in a country song

[Bridge]
(Yep, yep, yeah, baby)
Aw, naw, Conway and George Strait
Never did it this way
Back in the old days
Aw, y'all, we ain't a cliché
That ain't no way to treat a lady

[Chorus]
Like a girl in a country song
How in the world did it go so wrong?
Like all we're good for
Is looking good for you and your friends on the weekend
Nothin' more (Woo)
We used to get a little respect
Now we're lucky if we even get
To climb up in your truck, keep our mouth shut, and ride along
Down some old dirt road we don't even wanna be on
And be the girl in a country song (Yeah, baby)
