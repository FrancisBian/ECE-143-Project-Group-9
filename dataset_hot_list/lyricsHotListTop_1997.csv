0,Candle In The Wind 1997/Something About The Way You Look Tonight,"[Round 1: Dizaster]
What you gon' hear today
Is the mother of all anti-Semitic hate raps
This is revenge for all the dead children
That fell victim from way back
This here is for every single Arab
Shit, even the Christians are gonna feel like they're getting their payback, once I rape your mother in the ass with no protection, bare back, wearing a Mel Gibson face mask
You know what rhymes with bar mitzvah? Swastika
Let's see where you're at, Iron
Let's see if Solomon can handle this
Today I'ma put you through some body building championships
You gon' get pushed to your max, Iron
Straighten out your act here
‘Cause any hot-headed shit will get you laid out flat, Iron
Today I'ma run laps around him
'Til he get exhausted and I tire Iron like he had a flat tire
‘Cause he never had drive
He just stood on the side and watched me pass by him
He's passed his prime, so ain't no use for him coming back fightin'
The last time anyone gave a fuck about Iron's mic
Is when we had Tyson, so if Iron make a comeback for one last time he gon' get smashed like him
You've been pussy since Grizzle Mania, duckin' and divin'
Always playing about being safe and survivin'
I know you vanished away, and take cover, so it ain't no surprisin'
That once he takes cover ain't no way I'ma find him
‘Cause Annie Frank used to guide him
So I know she told you all the perfect places to hide in
Yeah, Anne Frank… What a damn skank!
Someone, pass me my gas tank!
I am Hitler, the real Heinrich Himmler
Sieg heil to your wife and sister
You've been on two lists your whole life… mine and Schindler's
I asked you to battle me, the first time you said ""no""
The second time you said ""no""
If you would've flaked this time
It would've been your third Reich in a row
I said, I thought you would flake
I'm honestly shocked you would take me
Had me feeling like Pesci all day
I started sweating thinking he didn't have the balls to face me
But now that we here, Iron, I know who your father is
You grew up off of Little Mermaid royalties
Since we were in third grade; you was always rich
The reason you fell off is this
It's the work ethic, you never have to work hard for shit
You never starved for shit
Anything you asked Daddy for you would always get
See, you that fat guy that walked into the gym
Got on a treadmill and jogged a bit, but you never stayed on it for long enough to even break no body sweat
So now you're stuck in the same plateau
You haven't evolved from since, but use your common sense
You've been living off a false sense of accomplishment
‘Cause if you worked hard like all us did
You would've not have quit, you probably'd thought a bit
And realized, ""Nah, I worked too hard for this
I'm Iron Solomon, I'll go back and demolish 'em!""
Where's your gladiator armor kit? Your heart of Spartacus?
Your ""I am Sparta"" shit? C'mon, dawg, you got this shit!
I'm giving you back all your confidence
You soaking all this in, you know, I normally charge for this
I'm just saying, you was a legend to all of us
But when you're in the room your energy isn't really felt
Try to yell your bars to us
Your vocal projection just never hits hard enough
Like uhh… [*snaps fingers*] like a Math Hoffa punch
But aren't you Jewish? Aren't you Jewish?
You celebrated so many Hanukkah's that by now you supposed to have way more presence than all of us
We used to call you a pioneer. You went from that to letting your bitch re-write your third round for Daylyt
Wait a minute, you let your broad re-write all your hard work and tears? You take advice from someone else?
Wait, y'all don't think that's weird?
Honestly you can call it how you want to call it
But to me all this shit is clear
Iron Man could never get the job done
Without someone like Jarvis talking in his ear
Makes sense you're Tony Starks though
‘Cause every time you get picked apart in a battle
It's back to the lab to have your bitch walk around
Holding up the pad, helping you charge up for a year
That's why Tony Stark is never as solid as he appears
You've always been in constant fear
The Iron suit is just an outer part
The center piece is hollow up in here
Iron Man has had an artificial heart from the start of his career
Now look where your life's at, nigga!
See, you were fine 'til you tried Smack, but you can't deny facts
That if Iron himself had the type of endurance, then he might last
But he left too much of a wide gap
Where he didn't focus on his rhyme craft
So if you paid more attention in science class, you would know that iron becomes rusty when you let too much time pass
These bars I drop got knowledge in 'em, Darwinism
Charles Dickens versus non-fiction DNA mama level autism
Plus, your father scripted all of Oscar The Grouch's shit for Sesame Street, so now I know where you inherit all your garbage writtens
Yeah, you fell off, you gotta admit it
You should've moved to New Orleans and got an apartment to live in with a bunch of tsunami victims, so you can share stories all day about how you're washed up with them
This is God gifted, I'm God-gifted
Watching me spit is like a game of Twister
‘Cause I can catch bodies back to back with my skills on the spot
And that's the reason you got us all twisted
I mean, you the best freestyler? Explain how
Yo, back in the day, if you didn't recycle so much
You wouldn't even have a name now
And I'm gonna explain how, you know the, ""You're behind on California time"" you told The Saurus?
That was the second time you recycled those same rounds
Let's play a game of I Swear Now
Say, ""I swear on my newborn child I didn't use those lines in a battle with Okwerdz that never came out.""
Look at his face now!
You look like you just got caught in a stupid lie
You have a better chance of getting Sacha Cohen
To show up here dressed up as Borat in a suit and tie
‘Cause that's the only way this crowd gonna get to see another Arab get played by a Jewish guy
I'm tryin' to get y'all to see
That he's the fakest freestyler that's on the scene
But y'all don't see it, y'all just obsessed with these little pussies
Like a bunch of Carter Deems
He's a dead man walkin', he's almost in his coffin
He's just caught in between
He got one window to get outside of this box he's in
I got him inside of a laundry machine
And that's the irony in it, ‘cause even if Iron makes it out of it clean
All it means is me and Iron still got to iron out some things
We gon' get right down to the T
Even if you don't like how it seems
If he won't tell me what his true religion is, fuck it
I'ma find out when he gets [*punched*] right out of his jeans
How was that for an ironing theme?
Well, I got a different type of iron scheme
I'll take an iron fist to Iron's cheek like an Iron Sheik
And you wouldn't dare fight me inside the ring
I wish he would try me, even if I tried him he wouldn't try a thing
Even if Iron was Tiger Woods you wouldn't see Iron swing
But you'll probably rap about Math for three rounds
If you do, then be prepared to throw hands with me now
If you did, it would be like the Shazam app
‘Cause you would quickly catch a beat down
I don't give a fuck if you think I'm emotional, bitch
If you acting tough like Andy Gump
We can go outside and box over this shit
I'm about to hit him with the fucking closer, ‘cause I don't care
Kill yourself, ‘cause even if you did people probably still won't care
Take your Spring Fever CD
Walk to a black hole, get lost in the middle of nowhere
And don't forget to take Adam Sandler
And all his gay-ass movies with you when you go there! Faggot!

[Round 1: Iron Solomon]
Oh… Fuck. I made my own bed
When I was dormant, I gave y'all a reason to snooze on me
Tonight we putting that to rest
Y'all still sleeping, then you zombies
What you'll see is a true homi
That looks like lipo to you prob'ly
‘Cause he's gonna suck and I'ma get a new body
This throne is my home, I came back for the upkeep
With retard strength, all your battles are dumb weak
This quack will be duck meat for flappin' too much beak
I'm doing my numbers on the web: duck feet
If you fucked The Saurus's mother forty some weeks
Before The Saurus was born you couldn't compete
If you wouldn't come East, I'd come confront him in the West
I'd throw hands across America, every fucking punch connects
You a one and done at best, I'm the one who done it best
Big killers sleep in a guillotine, a cut above the rest
I'm the recoil that'll leave your gun hand crushed
True artist, I paint pictures with a drum and brush
I'm the one man band that Questlove can't touch
Serve food for thought like The Roots front man's lunch
Do You Want More?!!!??! Do you want more?
Your half life starts once Organik flips the coin
‘Cause that's when things fall apart
And this is just the tipping point for now, brother
I'ma milk this, my style butter
The crowd love me like a cow's utter in Calcutta
The savior, the Christians prayin' to Jesus
To Jews I am Moses, to Pagans I'm they Zeus
Walk the crowd like the holy ghost, strolling through the convent
You can smell Jehovah's odor on me: I am godsent
You will never see me lose to this old Lebaneser Scrooge
They booked a death machine for you
I suggest you think it through
You'll get digested, eaten, chewed: you a recipe for food
Step inside the lion's den, you don't get to leave the zoo
A different pedigree than you, that's why I would like to question
What did you bring to the game?
What makes this guy some type of legend?
Working 20 years on his precise refined impression
Of Eminem’s exact style from 1997?
This Afghan a Stan, such a rabid fan
Your whole style is cut from someone else's cloth: you Dapper Dan
With a master plan to spit some multi-syllable shit
To distract the fans while you spit some old silly bullshit
Get out the kiddie pool, Diz, you supposed to be an adult
You keep getting old, but we don't seem to see the results
You're just a lost boy: Peter Pan
Whose punchlines never land
When D's in bad form he needs a hook to get a hand
I mean, for real, what's this guy's problem?
Tinkerbell is what I call him
He got dusted and did some fairy shit to keep the light on him
""I want views like Fetty Wap to get the blind to see
I only got to sock it to get to where I should be.""
Lash out and patch it up, nothing's cornier
What you've become gave battles a stigma, Diz
I'm disappointed at what my pupil's done
In hindsight, the Bay watches you hassle Hoffa for lime light
And this guy's hype off of that surprise fight
Like that's a prize fight
Even though we know you only go to blows if it's staged right
The irony, that these homophobe's fans support gay rights
Had your people ridin' the benches, jump right into trenches
You got some grimy intentions
When you're inside of these lenses
You see, to me, turning battles into fights is just senseless
But cross the line, this battle will bare a striking resemblance
I'm a wig splitter, I'm a ditch digger
I'm a shit kicker and I'm a bit bitter
You a quick pitcher, I'm a big swinger
Won't be the one running: I'm a pitch hitter
Fans of Diz figure I get disfigured… FUCK YOU! THIS FINGER!
If y'all keep it 100, then it'll be a 3-0: that's six figures
But since homie's a clown
I might throw my third round, ‘cause I want to sock ya
So if I beat this pussy ass 2-1, it's not a shocker
I will bow bow: Waka Flaka, better call a doctor
When I lick a shot in your noodle: penne alla vodka
When I'm done whuppin' your ass we gon' kick it at Brass Rail
There's a chick with a fat tail that be sendin' me fan mail
Them hoes aren't playin', see everybody knows our name
‘Cause I be tossing paper like I'm tryna expose Arcane

[Round 2: Dizaster]
Alright, so, you brought up the Math fight, of course
And I think it's awesome for you to reference
And I think it's really awesome for you to mention
No, honestly, bro, thanks for putting your two cents in
Are you sure it's not too expensive?
I know, for you being a Jew that's kind of a huge investment
You fucking chubby Chucky, southern country Humpty Dumpty-looking… Fucking ugly, musty, dusty, Rose Teletubby
Barney Rubble body double, Bubba Dudley cuddle buddy!
You fucking loser!
This guy is like Allen Iverson, he could've been the G.O.A.T
But he fucked up most of his chances, and that's the difference between the Kobe's and the Jordan's and Magic's
The ones that stayed in the game
And gave you more and more classics
And the ones that eventually fell off ‘cause they almost thought they were too good to show up to court for their practice
I know we appear like we're closely matched
But our roads don't overlap
When I kept on moving forward and passed
And you hit the fork in the road and went backwards
We both started off as the total package
And then you dipped into the lower bracket
Came back below the average of the normal standards
All it took was a little four-year absence
And you became a former has-been like Toni Braxton
You put in all this work to record these albums
That most fans in battle rap don't download no tracks from
The other half don't even notice you enough to even know you have one – this must be what it feels like to be La Toya Jackson
Plus, I got another question I been wantin' to ask him
Do you rap while you're doing home gymnastics?
Do you put your notepad down on your yoga mattress?
And you perform your dances like your multisyllabics
How you covert, you're graphic, so over-dramatic
Like an HBO crime scene show reenactment
Bro, you're a faggot!
Doctor's done fucked you up with a lot of medication, bro
And you got no more skill
Can't get back to his normal self
‘Cause he don't even know how normal feel
Quick, someone toss Jonah Hill another Soma pill
So he can focus still
‘Cause he's looking real shaky on film like Cloverfield
But anyways, how's that studio going though?
You recording still? Bro, you're ill
Still working toward that recording deal?
You'll make it… I know you will
‘Cause what you gon' do? Survive off your Fight Klub days?
Nobody even remembers those older rounds
The only thing we remember from Fight Club is
""Yo, hold it down!!! Hold it down!!!""
That's how annoying your fucking host would sound
Or who else remembers his battles from the Hall of Fame?
When you went off the top with a dude with his top off
Who remembers Iron Solomon versus Flamez?
Yeah, he got the W, right?
But him in that battle and the Holocaust were the same
‘Cause it wasn't no surprise to see a Jewish guy body in flames
Burn and you get burned in the game
Burn and I'll burn you with flames
Shit, even Bernie Sanders has the word ""burn"" in his name
Now you're in a dead zone where no one enters
""Pop pop"" goes the Heckler
Go against me, your physical form dismembered
You won't be able to use your legs or arms again
Like Denzel Washington when he starred in the Bone Collector
Your father built you an in house studio
To record your records and get your stuff done
But it's fucked up ‘cause you can't have black people come over
‘Cause ""Son, we don't trust them.""
It's all awkward ‘cause every time he has black folks recording over
And he comes into the room and confronts them
Like, ""Haah, soo, Young Gunz… where do you know my son from?""
All that matters when they view this back is who could rap
So where are all my goons from Fallujah at?
In the streets letting bazooka's and Ruger's clap
UZI's, MAC's with the new attachments
I got Halo from the future gats
Huger straps than the one's Duke Nukem has
Boom boom, shoot your ass, Hadouken flash
Boom boom, chalaka-boo your ass! I don't give a fuck!
Boom boom, North Korea nuclear blast
I'll reduce you to ash with a nuke, and nuke and ash
""What's that?"" – dude, that's Nash! You stupid ass!
Yo, my resume is like a fucking cemetery
Full of piles of human stacked
‘Cause I done caught more overseas bodies than the Cuban raft
If white boy got a 9, then he can get schooled with that
Get it? ‘Cause we're from two different schools
He a junior high school student, I'm a fully developed uni-grad
I'm too advanced for you to grasp
You Columbine poppin' 9's
I'm a Virginia Tech going off on students campus
Which means me and you are not in the same shooting class
Plus my newest strap got a built in Mac computer that
Keeps all of your vehicle movement's tracked like an Uber app
Can open up your location on Google Maps
See you in the window and zoom in fast
Shoot your ass through the glass
Spill your... ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​[*Diz fucks up here*]
I'm fucking up, I meant ""Spill your medulla on the Isuzu dash""
Then the people that are moving past
Will scream: ""Help! Someone just killed the fat kid from Superbad!""
And I don't give a fuck who you have
Bring your goons for backup
Then it's AngryFan movements: I'm only using caps
I'll put you and all your fruity-ass dogs together
In the same bag like a pack of Scooby Snacks
And if you come back from the dead...
I'ma put a giant round in the back of your head
Like one of your stupid-looking Jewish hats
I'll body everything in the room moving like I'm Supernat
Leave me alone before I blow a fuse and snap
Like a fuselage with a fuse attached
You'll get your fucking right socket removed and snatched
Get your eyeball turned into a wounded gash
And the next interview that you do with Vlad
You'll be on the couch telling stories with one of your pupils patched, Slick Rick The Ruler's back!
When I say ""Turn up!"", I mean turn up to the max…
I mean turn up to a vegetable
You seen that movie Expendables?
Well, I'll put you in a cast just as huge as that
Pussy! And you have pink eye!

[Round 2: Iron Solomon]
[*​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Iron Solomon clapping*]​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ Good for you, Diz!
You got Pat Stay's formula down, and your formula down
I mean, you packed 60 seconds
With enough bars for a four-minute round
And you make it work, it's this crazy blur
Of rhyming schemes and hateful words
That you vomit out your mouth like you're tryna feed a baby bird
At some point you got a diss line for me or maybe Eurgh
A crowd reaction distracts him
He shouts ""FAGGOT!"" and a bunch of racial slurs
Just hoeing and yapping when he's supposed to be rapping
Acting like you got ovaries, and overreacting
So we can just guess what's next
From slug fest to gun threats, this chump went from throwing temper tantrums to throwing up sets
Choked out Billy, now he feel he's a roughneck
Been on 52 cards, got more attention from one deck
Looking like a junky that don't have any drugs left
You either need to catch up on rest or have a blood test
‘Cause the effects of crack and coke
Are what Dizaster don't consider
You got deeper into some yay shit than Amber Rose's fingers
So if you see this addict twitchin' like he can't control his temper
It's been half a minute since he had a chance to post on Twitter
I'm just tryin' to diagnose all of this clown's symptoms
Charron's autistic, but you've got ""I Want To Be Down""-syndrome
The type of lost nerd who wants to be hip hop so bad just to fit in
He got the Microsoft Word graffiti font tattooed on his skin
And what's under that mountain of ink
You need to talk about to a shrink
But there's a lot smarter people in this crowd than you think
We hear the contradictory shit out of your mouth when you speak
How you call Pat Stay a racist, then call Dumbfoundead a chink
Told Hoffa, ""Stop eating fried chicken!"", hardy har
That's as funny as the n-word with a hard -ER
So go on and recite all the bars you can write
About the Holocaust one night
Call me a ""kike"" and a bunch of shit I'm sure Caustic would like
(Thanks for the heroin, dawg!)
It's a strong strategy, Diz, say it with audacity!
Get loud! Talk rapidly! The crowd will all laugh at me
But if that exposes the bigots, then I'll take the fall happily
You think racism is hip hop? You're buying the wrong rap CD's
Under our skin we the same color
Don't believe it, then fight me!
Do it! You'll see you're just like me
When you get beat to the white meat
Maybe Iron Sol' versus Iron Sheik is what all of you wanted
Muhammad Ali versus Ali Muhammad
Well, that worked pretty well
I'ma make me some racist remarks now: your peoples eat pita
You were raised to be making these soft rounds
We ate matzah when we fled from Egypt, we went missin'
Where the heat of the desert
Where the stones were our best kitchen
And our food's hard texture is stemmed from that existence
What I'm saying is, going back generations we bred different
Our religious text gave us ambition your clan's missin'
2000 years before Muslims our Bible was handwritten
Y'all changed Abraham to Ibrahim and ran with that transcription
The Torah is the O.G., the Quran is just fan fiction
Boy, you done picked a bad Jew to attack
You know how many MC's I ran through for a rack?
Your integrity's out of wack
Look around the room, faces from everywhere on the map
Our bond is rap, you should honor that
But every card he act like he's as serious as a heart attack
But gotta lean on shock value to bring a body back
This preacher testified just to keep you mesmerized
You can't see through his disguise
You need to reconnect your eyes
I mean Jesus effing Christ, every freaking single rhyme
Like a Lebaneser mime in Lethal Weapon 5
And in your egotistic mind, you believe in every line
So we may never get to see this style you beat to death just die
Exposing D's deception gets him peeved in every line
I'm making this pussy tight: this a kegel exercise
See, people recognize this Dizaster character is not you
You had a Halloween party where rappers battled in costume
You made them stay in fake persona
Instead of going off real life, so you won't have to be the only one who knows what that feels like
See, he'll strike when he steps out of his lane and gets bold
But you ain't really from the gutter, you're just playin' a role
So please, spare us, spare us
You ain't cookin' coke, you ain't never seen the hood befo'
You sweeter than a Tootsie Roll
Wrapped up in some cookie dough
Shoved inside a pussy hole of a virgin playing footsie toe
Your Gjonaj battle is the only time you pushed an O
And when you fucked up that jelly fish line
What Dizaster revealed up here
Is what you mean to yell in your rhymes isn't actually real, it's clear
See, I'm a man of war when I'm on a sting
Your death's been sealed
My lines lean up to a body, I tend to kill
I flew here to get the mileage, you flew here to get demolished
What they paid you pays your rent
'Bout to put my kid through college
If you take away the hype, all the hate and spite. Just to lose to Mook they gave me twice what you got paid tonight
Yo, my status may have fell, but when our check's coming through
You'll see that even when I take an L, I get double you
Yeah, I went over with Lyt, but tonight I'll respect time
I said I'd kill you with three minutes, and we right at the deadline

[Round 3: Dizaster]
Yo! Now this guy… really has pink eye [*Iron Solomon tries to get into Dizaster's face exposing his pink eye*]
Back off! ‘Cause I don't want to be in front you
You fricking disgrace!
You've already had it happen to you once
Don't make me rub some more shit in your face!
Here comes the guy whose career died a long time ago
In the year 3 King Of The Dot BC, 500 Grind Times ago
Comes a guy from the biased coast
Who's about to get all of his stripes revoked like Spider Loc's
See, you said in one of the lines you wrote
That the doctors prescribed you the same drugs as Michael
Okay, that means you use all kinds of dope
Just so your mind can cope
So know, if you had the chance to be the straw that broke the camel's back, you would use it to sniff a line of coke
Ever since Mook your career been on a declining slope
It's like Gary Coleman's last episode alive
That's a double meaning line: If you take the name of his show title and the way he died and combine them both
Then you'd finally know why this is his final stroke
Your fucking music career is one big giant Heimlich choke
You should've known with an album like Monster you would wind up broke, it's all in your bio
Didn't see a single sell from it or multiply in growth
Since your career was under the spotlight of the microscope
What, do I gotta break it down in a science course or somethin'?
Iron divides into four different types of isotopes
Which could explain why you spent half of your life
On the shelf tryna blow, but Iron won't
See, a lot of elements become radioactive after their half life
But Iron don't, which is why he's a normal Iran, I suppose
‘Cause all the deals they had for him on the table folded
And they never got Iron closed
Yeah, that's why you're hanging from a thread on life support
You fucking got beat down in front of Mook
Until you couldn't fight no more
Which makes you the worst type of whore
The one that gets fucked once and quits ‘cause her vagina's sore
You should fucking kill yourself
Plus you violated as far as the guy code goes
I provided you guided roads wherever your drive go
I gave you the Geico quotes
The greatest of all time: the Michael Jordan of this entire sport
A satanic shrine logo: I am the G.O.A.T.
The Messiah, the eye of Horus
The Ayatollah to your Diaspora, I am your righteous Lord
I am your most high like a white boys Fico score
I am like Michael Kors ‘cause I can catch a big bag
And still have a lot of time in store
Get it? A big bag and still have a lot of time in store? Yeeeeah!
I'll hit you with a thousand lines like a Miley Cyrus tour
This is what Michael Moore would look like in his final form
I know you gon' reference the five days in Egypt
But trust me, this ain't that kind of war
This is more like fighting Thor inside of a lightning storm
I go psycho: Michael Myers with a knife inside of a psych ward cycle flow Niacin, goodnight you, bro
I'll put you to sleep in your own language: I'll Laila Tov you
Yeah, this diet Rone is gonna die alone
All it takes is one solid bar
He's a washed up body, punchlines are like Dial soap
Dynamo, you tryin' to fight a robot cyborg from Biocorps
They'll find you inside your home beside your phone
With your vital signs synchronized with the dial tone, BLEEEEP
Who gives a fuck if NY is a no-flying zone?
I got Palestine inside my bones
I'll hit you with a rock in your face from a couple kilometers away
That's what I call reaching a milestone
You will die from my pen stroke like Death Note
If it's written form we battle
Freestyle, I'll son you off the top like solar panels
And I got more examples
No matter how many menorah lamps you have
You'll never hold a candle
To the levels of pressure I was born to handle
You know why? ‘Cause you don't have no souls or backbones
Bro, you don't even know your past, bro
Real Jews were Hebrews, black men who used to grow their afros
You guys are just a bunch of random, phony, Polish assholes
Who forged your passports, and don't have a land of your own
So you come over and they jack yours
But what is it all for? Is it drilling off shore?
Is it the land, or do you want more?
See, Arabs were peaceful, bro, you can come into my house
I'd invite you in, take your keys to my car, the garage door
I just want you to feel comfortable at home
Since you're used to occupying households that are not yours
I wasn't even supposed to be here today
Organik was tryin' to get him and Hollow Da Don poppin' off
They had an investor from his side ready to put up all the guap
Made all these excuses at the end why it ended up fallin' off
But the real reason we did not see it
Is 'cause Solomon's people couldn't afford what Hollow cost
I ain't anti-Semitic, knock it off!
Before I go durka durka, allahu Akbar on him
And start letting rockets off
Droppin' bombs and launchin' tomahawks
I got a lot of fire bottled up like a walkin' Molotov
I'm a blacksmith: I'll put an Iron bar on the chopping block
I don't give a fuck if it's shalom shabbat or shabbat shalom
I'll punch you in the face
And leave your glasses broken on the floor: mazel tov!
You battled Mook on Smack and we watched you fall
You let a mark-ass brother outshine you
Take your spot: you Pau Gasol, and that's when you got on some bullshit and you dropped the ball
Now everyone knows you as that one cat
With a giant pussy in his lap like Marley Marl
It's the army of God
Think the ending of every Inspector Gadget, ‘cause all you saw
Was me putting a metal arm to this cat's head like Dr. Claw!
I know a little bit of Krav Maga
Fuckin' put your— twist your father into an arm bar
And knock his fucking yamaka off, fuck it
If me and Solomon brawl I'm knockin' out anybody involved
Boop Boppity Baow, stand over your head like Alex star
I'm off the hook with these hands, people call me Kabal
I move at light speeds like Vegeta
Break my right knee off in your jaw
Fuck a gun bar! I'm creative, I don't need one at all
I'll swing a fucking Pirates Of The Caribbean claw
Cut you in half, looking like a seesaw
Send the blade flying clean through the wall
Watch it come out of the side of the street
And kill five people that weren't even involved
I'm like an evil Peter Parker that delivers people karma
With a side order of beef kebab for starters
Fucking with me is retarded
Like asking Sweeney Todd to be your barber
I'm an evil Tamil-tiger guerrilla fighter from Sri Lanka
Followed you to your job and I'm camped outside of your job
And I can't wait for you to leave the office like Stephen Harper
Yeah, you think you can relate to Canadians more than me?
Hahaha! Bro, you are more pussy than a Weeknd concert
Even the concept of you beating me here in Toronto
Couldn't be more farther
Than the thought of Stevie Wonder being able to see his daughter
I'll fucking let the Glock sleep him
Put him in an arm bar 'til he stops breathin'
Like Eric Gardner when the cops beat him
Pay attention, that's a double bar meaning
I mean, either way you gon' die from arm squeezing
And yeah, they hated us
They hated us ever since the World Trade got hit
And they blamed us with all this bullshit
But what the media don't say is this
How many of your people didn't show up to work that day ‘cause they claimed they were sick?
Or the Zionist banker who took out that insurance claim
And then split? Explain to me this
How a national tragic event could make your people rich
Or how a bunch of cavemen in Afghanistan
Could penetrate the world's most sophisticated defense
And have these monolithic beams that are encased in cement
All cut at the precise angle you need a buildings foundation to slip
It's ‘cause you motherfuckers orchestrated the shit
And used the media as a tool to blame us swit, wit
To blame us swit wit? Or blame us with?
But it don't matter because you blamed the desert
For taking those plane flights
But it's clear as daylight that you staged that shit
And you only have one ball… I mean, it's all good, bro
Don't be mad ‘cause the doctor slashed your wontons
And you can't get a hard-on
You can still be the champ of any track you hop on
Even with half of your balls gone
You could ask Lance Armstrong
You could still be successful, it doesn't change at all
Look, look, man, you can ask Tom Brady, dawg
You can still make it in the game with a deflated ball
I know, I know… I bet that little ball of his at night gets lonely
Sitting in bed, he felt a trickle down his leg slowly
Thought he pissed on himself, but turned out to be his right nut pouring out liquor for his dead homie
He has one fucking ball, he can't fuck with me
This is the path toward the end, so listen and pay attention
‘Cause all your people ever did was scrutinize us
My people are true survivors
And you used the media as a way to oppress us
And generation after generation you try to euthanize us
Then we turn into revolution fighters
But what would you do if you was in a street seeing them kill women and execute their minors?
Shooting a child in his back? How could you justify seeing a two-year-old with a tank on his back like a scuba diver?
T'foo ealaykun, t'foo! Who grew al-Qaeda?
You grew al-Qaeda! You guys are fueling ISIS!
This ain't no war on terrorism, this is a Zionist Jewish crisis
A bunch of fucking greedy bankers
Who have no value for what human life is
If you ever, if you ever see an Arab group of snipers
Just know that's from weapons that you provide us
So we can kill each other
And you can use it as an excuse to crucify us
But not now, not now… I'ma flip out
Bro, who defied us? Who divide us?
What am I doing? I'm losing my mind, bitch
Give me the shit, I'm gonna fushalise this
I don't give a fuck what I'm gonna do, ‘cause this dude's the nicest

[Round 3: Iron Solomon]
So y'all wanna know the REAL reason that we had problems in Grind Time? It was-it was… ah… shit... me too
Might've been all in this guy's mind
I mean, when I picture what was at stake and follow the timeline
D was only beefing because I was in my prime
‘Cause we had never met before
They had rappers on every floor
And you paid Kap Kallous to book my room next to yours
Since you don't know the difference
Between real life and a message board
You trolled the hallway all day, postin' up on my bedroom door
The whole weekend you followed me, no drama or static
Then hopped on camera in your battle and you called me a faggot
And I'll never forget this, with Pumpkinhead as my witness
You ran right out of the ring to me and begged for forgiveness
It was awkward and kind of just weird
Offered to buy me a beer
Talking right in my ear, apologizing for years
About a line that Bachir took time to prepare that I didn't hear
‘Cause I wasn't watching your battle, because I didn't care!
See, between love and hate there's a thin line
But for Diz, no disconnect
So everybody that Diz respects becomes someone he disrespects
From the indirects to the blatant hate
In your Twitter rants you've discussed me
But you're on my dick the second we're face to face
Tryin' to give me dap – you disgust me
With your rants and your ten page speeches
Talking junk about Smack more than an N.A. meeting
If you and URL's relationships something you can't repair
You know what a real gangster would do?! Just not battle there
What's wrong with King of the Dot? Know what I'm saying?
You hate the East Coast ‘cause we never gave you support
We gave you hip hop culture, Diz, we gave you this sport
The way that you walk
Your dress code, the slang that you talk
You from the ""Fresh Coast""?
Son, the word ""fresh"" came from New York
You pull your iPhone out at all of your battles
An awesome example
Of how all of the raps that you spit you got from the Apple
Y'all know that his note section is just a pad full of writtens
So what, it's cool to do that now ‘cause Canibus did it?
You such a hip hop purist
How's that a crutch you still rely on?
We've seen Diz sell out in battles more than Melathion
You call street rappers phony, but your gun bars be dialed out
It's like you can't get a line out without a 9 now
The principles even talking, we don't ever see him walking
It's all theory, you don't really stand for shit: you Stephen Hawking
It's so feeble, Flint Michigan tap water: your flow's lethal
But only because the poison you fed 'em misled your own people
You're not a terrorist, you're a tourist, a gimmick
Pointing your fingers at our flaws like a critic
To hide your fraudulent image
The real perpetrator's you, but you don't want to admit it
You're like the coward that killed Cyrus
And said ""The Warriors did it!"" – Oh. You. Fucking. Hypocrite!
You whore for attention, you exhibitionist
You preach, but you don't practice
Give a speech and contradict the shit
You overdose with coke in the nose, emotional roller coaster
You opportunist, you Brutus, Judas, you culture vulture!
I hate you, but it's my fault, because I stepped out of this ring
And turned my queen to my ex wifey
And I prayed her new suitor would be a king who was just like me
I walked away from this woman who was the love of my life
And I can't stand that her new man just ain't fucking her right
See, when you was still tryna steer through the bottom tier
And the future of battle rap was not as clear, I was here
Been a pioneer the entirety of my career
I made this backpack shit take off: I'm the Rocketeer
I spelled out this path to give y'all some direction
Put myself on the map so you could follow the legend
What I deserve I achieve with just a verse and a beat
I didn't work for a fee, and what I earned wasn't free
Went on a murdering spree, hit every curb in the street
When it was 30 degrees I was still burning MC's
In terms of this league, my words and my schemes
Are the birds and the bees, the sperm and the seeds
What emerged was this league
So you're the MC you are because you are birthed from my breed
I didn't quit and come back, I took maternity leave
I fathered your whole existence, Diz, you learned this from me
You played the role of an heir you're unworthy to be
You're not Solomon reborn, you've been keeping my seat warm
A disfigured version of me, that's how D formed
And the Commodore and Eli might seem like a lovely option
'Til you realize, in real life
What it feels like without Nucky Thompson
Let Diz, Pat and Mac scrap for seconds and thirds

1,How Do I Live,"[Verse 1]
How do I get through one night without you?
If I had to live without you
What kind of life would that be?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I, I need you in my arms, need you to hold
You're my world, my heart, my soul and if you ever leave
Baby you would take away everything good in my life
And tell me now

[Chorus]
How do I live without you? I want to know
How do I breathe without you if you ever go?
How do I ever, ever survive?
How do I, how do I, oh, how do I live?

[Verse 2]
Without you there'd be no sun in my sky
There would be no love in my life
There'd be no world left for me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I, baby, I don't know what I would do
I'd be lost if I lost you, if you ever leave
Baby, you would take away everything real in my life
And tell me now

[Chorus]
How do I live without you? I want to know
How do I breathe without you if you ever go?
How do I ever, ever survive?
How do I, how do I, oh, how do I live?

[Bridge]
Please, tell me, baby
How do I go on if you ever leave?
Baby, you would take away everything, I need you with me
Baby, don't you know that you're everything good in my life?
And tell me now

[Chorus]
How do I live without you? I want to know
How do I breathe without you if you ever go
How do I ever, ever survive?
How do I, how do I, oh, how do I live?
How do I live without you?
How do I live without you, baby?

2,You Make Me Wanna...,"[Intro: Jermaine Dupri]
This is what you do, this is what you do
This is what you do, this is what you do

[Chorus: Usher]
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me

[Verse 1: Usher]
Before anything began between us
You were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to when me and my girl was having problems
You used to say it would be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I go home at night and lay my head down
All I seem to think about is you
And how...

[Chorus: Usher]
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me

[Verse 2: Usher]
Now, what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowing it should've been you
What's sad is I love her, but I'm falling for you
What should I do?
Should I, tell my baby bye-bye?
Should I, do exactly what I feel inside?
'Cause I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together

[Chorus: Usher]
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me

[Bridge: Usher]
At this point, the situation's out of control
I never meant to hurt her, but I gotta let her go
And she may not understand it while all of this is going on
I tried, I tried to fight it, but the feeling's just too strong
You make, make, make me

[Interlude: Usher & Jermaine Dupri]
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
Come along with
You're making me, you're making me

[Chorus: Usher]
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with

3,Together Again,"[Intro]
There are times when I look above and beyond
There are times when I feel your love around me, baby
I'll never forget my baby
I'll never forget you

[Verse 1]
There are times when I look above and beyond

Look deeper inside you, baby

Dream about us together again
What I want: us together again, baby
I know we'll be together again, 'cause

4,Been Around The World,"[Intro: Mase]
This Mase, you know what I'm saying
You got niggas that don't like me for whatever reason
You got niggas that don't wanna see me rich
You got niggas that's mad cause I'm always with they bitch
Then you got niggas that just don't like me
You know the, those PHD niggas
But you know I pop a lot of shit but I back it up though
See it's a difference
A lot of niggas pop shit
But a lot of niggas don't make hits
But it's like this whole Bad Boy shit
We come to bring it to y'all niggas, me, B.I., Puff, Lox, whoever, Black Rob
If you wanna dance, we dance

[Verse 1: Mase]
Now trick what, lace who, that ain't what Mase do
Got a lot of girls that'd love to replace you
Tell you to your face boo not behind your back
Niggas talk shit, we never mind that
Funny never find that, Puff a dime stack
Write hot shit and make a nigga say, rewind that
Niggas know, we go against the Harlem Gigolo
Getcha ho, lick her low, make the bitch hit the door
I represent honeys with money fly guys with gems
Drive with the tints that be thirty-five percent
Hoes hope I lay so I look both ways
Cop says okay my tint smoke gray
No way, nigga leave without handing me my shit
Got plans to get my Land and my six
Niggas outta pen'll understand this shit
Pop champagne like I won a championship

[Refrain: Notorious B.I.G.]
Been around the world and I I I
And we been playa hated
I don't know and I don't know why
Why they want us faded
I don't know why they hate us
Is it our ladies
Or our drop Mercedes
Baby, baby

[Verse 2: Puff Daddy]
I was in one bedroom, dreaming of a million
Now I'm in beach houses, cream to the ceiling
I was a gentleman living in tenements
Now I'm swimming in all the women that be tens
Went from Bad Boys to the Crushed Linen Men
Now my divi-dends be the new Benjamins
Hoes of all complexions
I like cinnamon
Mase you got some hoes well nigga send em in
What you waiting for, let the freak show begin
How they came in a truck? (Nah Puff, that's a Benz...)
Mercedes, c'mere baby, you don't like the way
It's hot and hazy, never shady, you must be crazy
It's ridiculous how you put your lips on this
Don't kiss right there, girlfriend, I'm ticklish
And I be switching ve's with a wrist full of G's
Nigga please, I'm the macaroni with the cheese

[Refrain: Notorious B.I.G.]
Been around the world and I I I
And we been playa hated
I don't know and I don't know why
Why they want us faded
I don't know why they hate us
Is it our ladies
Or our drop Mercedes
Baby, baby

[Verse 3: Puff Daddy]
Now Puff rule the world even though I'm young
I make it my biz to see that all ladies cum
Get em all strung from the tip of my tongue
Lick em places niggas wouldn't dare put they faces
Before I die, hope I, remake a flow by
In the brand new treasure on a old try
Now when my throat dry, even when the smoke lie
Eat the Mami chocha and drive her loca
We never ride far, packed five in a car
Save money for the drinks
I'm about to buy the bar
And everywhere I drive I'm a star
Little kids all on the corner scream, that's my car
It was days couldn't be fly, now I'm in a T.I
Come in clubs with B.I., now a nigga V.I
Rock tons of gold, nuff money I fold
Roll the way you wanna roll, break a hundred at the toll

[Refrain: Notorious B.I.G.]
Been around the world and I I I
And we been playa hated
I don't know and I don't know why
Why they want us faded
I don't know why they hate us
Is it our ladies
Or our drop Mercedes

They figure I wouldn't wild when I'm in my fresh clothes (Come on)
Dress as I suppose, from my neck to my toes
Neck full of gold, baguettes in my Rolls
Wreck shows, collect those, extra O's
Buy the E, get a key, to the Lex to hold

Just started seeing cars because they auctioned it
So while you daydream, my Mercedes gleam
And I deal with ho's that pose in Maybelline

11,A Song For Mama,"The sun was coming up, I was coming back down
Mama called my phone, and said ""Son what happened now?""
Whiskey on my breath, smelling just like a bar
I could hear Mama crying, I think I broke her heart

I'm sorry Mama, for all the pain I put you through
All the nights you were praying, I should've prayed too
You gave me your heart, I gave nothing back to you
And I'm sorry Mama, for all the pain I put you through

Went off the deep end, getting high and I've been drinking
Told Mama goodbye, dammit I'm leaving
Cocaine in my blood stream, baptized in whiskey
The night I wrecked my truck, the good Lord was with me
I could feel my heart racing, and I'm slowly dying
In the back of my mind I could hear Mama crying

I'm sorry Mama, for all the pain I put you through
All the nights you were praying, I should've prayed too
You gave me your heart, I gave nothing back to you
And I'm sorry Mama, for all the pain I put you through

I got these scars, and I got these tattoos
But these blue eyes, Mama I got from you
These two hands taught me how to pray
I count my blessings, more every day

I'm sorry Mama for all the pain I put you through
All the nights you were praying, I should've prayed too
You live like an angel, for a sinner like me
You loved me through it all, I was a burned out fiend
You gave me your heart; I gave nothing back to you
I'm sorry Mama, for all the pain I put you through
I'm sorry Mama, for all the pain I put you through",Casey Daniels Band,1997,"[12, 13, 27]",3

How could the one who made me happy, make me feel so sad?

If you love me, how could you hurt me like that
How could the one I gave my world to, throw my world away?
How could the one who said, ""I love you,"" say the things you say?
How could the one I was so true to, just tell me lies?
How could the one I gave my heart to, go and break this heart of mine, tell me?

[Bridge 1]
How could you be so cold to me
When I gave you everything?
All my love, all I had inside
How could you just walk out the door?
How could you not love me anymore?
I thought we had forever, I can't understand

[Chorus 2]
How could the one I shared my dreams with, take my dreams from me?
How could the love that brought such pleasure, bring such misery?
Won't somebody tell me, somebody tell me please
If you love me how could you do that to me, tell me?

How could you just walk out the door?
How could you not love me anymore?
I thought we had forever

Won't it ever stay the same

Girl I know that things aren't going right
But don't you think it deserves a fight

And if we don't wake up, it's a memory
A time gone past, a love that sailed away

She lost the only man she loved
He went away

19,I Don't Ever Want To See You Again,"[Verse 1]
Early one mornin'
While you were asleep
I received a letter
But there was no addressee
So I paid it no mind, in fact
I wanted to send it back
But something that I was feeling
Said open it
It said, ""Dear reader
Once close friend of mine
Hope that this letter finds you in time
Cause your love is endin'
And my life's just beginnin'
With a woman that I know you hold dear to you""
And it made me wanna say

[Chorus]
I don't ever wanna see you again
But I stuck by you till the end
And my conscience is clear
And I can move on from here
But I wish I could say the same for you, baby
I don't ever wanna see you again, no, yeah
But tell me why did it have to be my best friend?
That you were messin' around with
I didn't want to notice it
I was true to my love for you

[Verse 2]
It took me a minute to wake up and see
What the love of my life was doin' to me
I wanted to lay down and die
Cause my pride wouldn't let me cry
But somehow I knew I had to get over it
He said he couldn't understand
Until he felt your touch
Now he can see why I love you so much
And that's so unfair
I never thought I'd have to share
Your love that I thought was given
To only me and that's why

[Chorus]
I don't ever wanna see you again
But I stuck by you till the end
And my conscience is clear
And I can move on from here
But I wish I could say the same for you, baby
And I don't ever wanna see you again
But tell me why did it have to be my best friend?
That you were messin' around with
I didn't want to notice it
I was true to my love for you

[Bridge]
And you say you love me?
(And you said you love me baby)
Love must've been blind
Cause I sure didn't see this one comin'
(I once was blind but now I see)
My best friend, huh?
They say keep the one's you love close
(Why'd you have to be so low down?)
And your enemy's even closer
But I can't win for losin', girl
(You were the closest thing to me baby)
Cause the one I thought was a friend to me
Ended up being my true enemy
(Knowin' all of the pain you caused me)
Listen to me, baby
I gave you everything
My love and my ring
And you violated me

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna see you again
I don't ever wanna see you again
But I stuck by you till the end
And my conscience is clear (so clear)
And I can move on from here (move on from here)
But I wish I could say the same for you, baby (I'm gonna say a prayer for you baby)
I don't ever wanna see you again (I don't wanna see you no more)
But tell me why did it have to be my best friend?

I didn't want to notice it
I was true to my love for you

I don't ever wanna see you again

But I stuck by you till the end
(I'd rather have a cold day in June)
And my conscience is clear
(So clear)
And I can move on from here
But I wish I could say the same for you, baby
(I need you right now, but...)
I don't ever wanna see you again
(I don't ever wanna see you. You know I don't really need you)
But tell me why did it have to be my best friend?

Why Missy be socking it to niggas like Ree-Ree?
The baddest industry bitches of the century
Hit hard like penitentiary dick
Finally admitted that we the shit combination is lethal
Popping Patron with Missy in the 600 with no see-through
Suffer the repercussion fucking with shit like this
We parlay puffing
Constantly making niggas suffer the consequence
Gotta get these ends bitch
House in the Chi with a Caddy, crib in Atlanta with a Benz
Niggas been huffing and puffing but ain't try shit
Got plenty motherfuckers that'll ride quick
Besides, kid wanna bust?
Trigger finger itch when you fucking with me
Jealous because I live more plush
Me and Missy leave a nigga with a head rush
Bring the ruckus, plus...
I'm telling 'em, push and pickin' up profits
For what I'm selling, never gon' stop it
Socking it to niggas and rocking it
Dropping 'em on the spot
Heat up any block or record shop
Knocking you off of your socks
Guaranteed platinum, watch two of the coldest bitches get hot
I be the B-R-A-T, her be Missy
We some bad bitches: who be fucking it up?
I'm the B-R-A-T, her be Missy
And we some bad bitches: who be fucking it up?

Zay
Mobbin'
You claiming HOG wearing MOB gear
These are more than fashion logos
When you see us know what we're representing
And that's the Logos
Forever mobbin homie we are not a pack of bozos
Can't have a circle looking weird out here
That's the noble
Can't be slacking doing kingdom business
That's immobile
Remember that man will on talent
God say that's a no no
When it comes to the gospel the impact is global
Bring the heat got up to city
Like what happened at Chernobyl
Bring to the Father to put Christ holy order
Upon me
Was a zombie
Want the living water not talking Dasani
Gimme a sword and I say it's on
When it come to this army
We going to war but never fold
I'm not origami
We've been given the message to take to the masses
So I spend my days in deep meditation and practice
Seeking repentance it cleared me from my horrible actions
So I'm not a hypocrite as I travel over the atlas

[Verse 2: Justus]
It's the mob nigga
It's more than music it is ministry
Started by Sevin if he's Paul I am Timothy
We take the gospel where them Lugers and them hitters be
We're supplying this industry
You dying if you fidgety
They get to riding
If you sliding with the menace beings
We ain't hiding anything
He's bright and what we fitna bring
He's light
So if anything think twice
Before you get the swing
You might even get to me
But desire ain't gone be hid from me
My blood brother was a blood
Brotha when I was cuz
That's what the neighborhood does
They be stay bathing in blood
Babies raped in mud
Scabies sage and drugs
But greater is His love greater is His love
And He will return to judge and begin again
God man spit fire from the skull just like finish him
In the end when they see what we did
At a minimum we delivered him
And we live in him
I guess you call that synonym

[Chorus: Justus]
I gotta be honest
You really don't want these problems
Now
We suffer in violence
The enemy still try to knock us now
We more than conquerors
There's no way to conquer us
If it ain't moving it ain't mobbin
We ain't losin'
We stay rockin'

Hog Mob
Life as a razorback
Used to hate to rap
Now lay a track and watch a gator snap
The hood I play Barack
Pray for that
Christ a life saber where Darth Vader at
Throw a white flag
It's too late for that
Gorilla with chinchilla demons
Are taking that
Sin killa in a tent
Well I don't know where brakes is at
He has feet ten milla
Christ name whole way
Jim Dilla
CHH fulla Ben Stillers
Ministry minded I don't chase a stack
I see ya boots but where your laces at
I bring the Son to where the shade is at
A pair of clippers runnin fades for that

Scottie Pippin
Shoot from the pivot
The ruger chew through your civic

You're new to the scrimmage
I'm truly committed

[Verse 4: Sevin]
Yeah Ghetto gospel
Bringing His love into where the thugs hang
They drug slang and it's nothing to hear a snub bang
I'm from the park homie
Better yank me out the blood gang
And left his mark on me when He saved me
That's a blood stain
On my momma I knew it since elementary
The way I'm getting down
I'll get threw in a cell eventually
A demon's spawn I was foolish
Thought hell was meant for me
But now I'm reading Psalms
When I suit up with hella infantry
Ahh
I seen a rope of sin
Strangle a heathen
But we invokers bringing hope to men
And manglin' demons
Baptize em
We splash whoever came to receive Him
Christ gang put up ya cash
Who wanna tangle this evenin'?
If you blastin the master you get chastised
We leave a serpent slain
Wet em with purple rain under black sky
I'm from the dark
Where life is harder than some crack pipes
I'm really out here nigga
I don't rap lies
No perpetrating the mission
I go berserk over the church or for the sake of the risen
They can insert me in the dirt
Or through the gate of a prison
I'd take a squirter to the face
Before I hesitate to say I'm a Christian
Yeshua
Came as a servant and He died for the lost
Paid our debt with His blood
He supplied what it cost
Showed us the Father
We'd rather follow idols that floss
Bottom line we are in sin commercializing His cross
If the game's bearing His name
Yet full of fame tricks and heretics
And it wears it in vain then we are supposed to judge it
As far as CHH I hate the culture of it
It doesn't look like Christ I'm not supposed to love it
Rough as raw hide
Nothing but the cross inside a hog's eye
Fadin' with satan
I let my paws fly
Touch not thy anointed boy
I am God's guy
Ice'll burn
Christ'll return before the MOB dies

I gotta be honest
You really don't want these problems

From the Bay to the Murder Mitten
My niggas put murder missions
She choosin', that's her decision, free my niggas in prison
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich
Got a blunt in my dental, blowin' hemp in a rental
On my way to Sacramento, late night; Arsenio
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless
Barely Harley, I'm chromeless, you might end up domeless
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I'll make a bitch stand outside forever, like the Statue of Liberty
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South
I raise my styrofoam up, and pour some drink in my mouth

I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til you're unconscious
Feel me when you get a fine bitch
Just don't forget to read the fine print

23,4 Seasons Of Loneliness,"[Verse 1: Wanya & Nate]
I long for
The warmth of
Days gone by
When you were mine
But now those days are memories in time
Life's empty
Without you
By my side
My heart belongs to you
No matter what I try

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn]
When I get the courage up to love somebody new
It always falls apart 'cause they just can't compare to you
Your love won't release me, I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change

[Chorus]
In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean
Where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves
The trees are bare when you're not here
It doesn't feel the same
(It doesn't feel the same, oh)

[Verse 2: Nathan & (Mike)]
Remember
The nights when (remember the night)
We closed our eyes (when we closed our eyes)
And vowed that you and I
Would be in love for all time

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn]
Everytime I think about these things I shared with you
I break down and cry 'cause I get so emotional
Until you release me I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change

[Chorus]
In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare
When you're not here
It doesn't feel the same

[Bridge: Wanya & (Mike)]
This loneliness has crushed my heart (it's killing me, baby)
Please let me love again (I just wanna know if I can fix this)

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn]
'Cause I need your love to comfort me and ease my pain
Or four seasons will bring the loneliness again

[Chorus]
In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare
When you're not here

To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else

Goodbye

[Verse 2]
The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips up into my nose
And I wish I could get back there, some place back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take
Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break
It won't stop, I won't come down
I keep stock with a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again, I said

[Pre-Chorus]
How do I get back there
To the place where I fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to
The place where you said...

[Chorus]
I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye

[Bridge]
I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be alright, alright
And when the plane came in, she said she was crashing
The velvet it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
But now I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess, I must confess
Those little red panties, they pass the test
So slide up 'round the belly face down on the mattress one
And you hold me
And we are broken
Still it's all that I want to do, just a little now
Feel myself hovering off the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down
No, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is alright, alright

[Chorus]
And I want something else
To get me through this life, baby
I want something else
Not listening when you say
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye

I wonder is there anything
I'm going to miss

Where we used to laugh
There's a shouting match
Sharp as a thumbnail scratch
A silence I can't ignore
Like the hammock by the
Doorway we spent time in, swings empty
Don't see lightning like last fall
When it was always about to hit me

I wonder how's it going to be
When it goes down
How's it going to be

Big goals, whoa

Young roll, roll
Let’s get her, get her
This is for the champagne sippers, what what

[Verse 1]
Guess jeans, Guess shirt like its 95’
Fresh scene, fresh work lace my Nike’s tight
I just came for the fun, I don’t like to fight
Drink my champagne straight up, I don’t like the ice
When a set see us, fresh linked up
Pull up to the scene in a stretch Beamer
They always used to tell us we was next, we up
Ill YaYa posed a threat, no they can’t see her
Now all I do is cash out by the way
The homies in the club, and they ashing that dank
I don’t say too much cause I’m passing the drink
My hands raise them up cause I’m dancing to Drake
Don’t play with it
Don’t play with it
If you’re gonna do your dance, gotta sway with it
We forever 21, what’s the age to weave?
Forever getting drunk, champagne we drink

Big fur, big chains in the coldest weather
Air Nikes, Fresh J’s we don’t own Margiela’s
Was going to be rich, won’t be broke forever, uh
I ask, no I’m sure
I’m the illest little chick that you’ve seen this far
Brothers make a wish when they see this star
Big money be the cliff, down there we get off
Buy your own bottle, don’t pass the drink
Hood rich, we don’t need a glass to drink
No, we don’t fight, we just dance in minks
By the end of the night need a nasty freak
It’s the old school G, in some 90’s clothes
Got an old school lean, cause I’m slightly on
Watching people go deep in my 90’s phone
Been doing my own thing since like 94’

30,Criminal,"[Intro]
A lot of people ask me stupid fuckin' questions
A lot of people think that what I say on a record
Or what I talk about on a record
That I actually do in real life or that I believe in it
Or if I say that I wanna kill somebody
That I'm actually gonna do it or that I believe in it
Well, shit, if you believe that, then I'll kill you
You know why? ‘Cause I'm a criminal!
Criminal! You're goddamn right
I'm a criminal! Yeah, I'm a criminal!

[Verse 1]
My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
That'll stab you in the head, whether you're a fag or lez
Or a homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest
Pants or dress, hate fags? The answer's yes
Homophobic? Nah, you're just heterophobic
Starin' at my jeans, watchin' my genitals bulgin' (Ooh!)
That's my motherfuckin' balls, you'd better let go of 'em
They belong in my scrotum, you'll never get hold of 'em!
""Hey, it's me, Versace! Whoops, somebody shot me!
And I was just checkin' the mail, get it? Checkin' the male?""
How many records you expectin' to sell
After your second LP sends you directly to jail?
Come on, relax, guy! I like gay men
Right, Ken? Give me an amen! (A-men!)
""Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus
Heal this child, help us destroy these demons
Oh, and please send me a brand new car
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital""
Preacher, preacher! Fifth grade teacher!
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither
You can't teach me a goddamn thing ‘cause
I watch TV and Comcast cable
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from toppin' these charts
And you can't stop me from droppin' each March
With a brand new CD for these fuckin' retards (Duh)
And to think, it's just little ol' me
Mr. Don't-Give-a-Fuck still won't leave

I'm a criminal!
‘Cause every time I write a rhyme these people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal!

And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one

The mother did drugs, hard liquor, cigarettes and speed
The baby came out, disfigured ligaments, indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Don't dare make fun of that baby, ‘cause that baby was me
I'm a criminal, an animal caged who turned crazed
But how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger
I drank more liquor to fuck you up quicker
Than you'd wanna fuck me up for sayin' the word—
My morals went *thhbbpp* when the president got oral
Sex in his Oval Office on top of his desk off of his own employee
Now, don't ignore me, you won't avoid me
You can't miss me: I'm white, blonde-haired, and my nose is pointy
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
In plane crashes and laughs as long as it ain't happenin' to him
Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Em-
-inem and Kim combined (The maniac's in)
In place of the Doctor ‘cause Dre couldn't make it today
He's a little under the weather, so I'm takin' his place (Mm-mm-mmm!)
Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
I told you, Dre, you should've kept that thang put away
I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh?

Tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck

Question existence until them questions are solved

From the south side of Chi to Brooklyn where I growed up
I confess, God in the flesh
Live among the serpents, turn arenas into churches
I'm like Michael, recycle, these are not 16's
These are verses from the Bible
Tell that preacher he's a preacher, I'm a motherfuckin' prophet
Smoke a tree of knowledge, drink from a gold chalice
You gotta love it, I arrive at the pearly gates
I had luggage, meaning I had baggage
Niggas asking me questions, I don't answer to these busters
Only God could judge us, motherfuckers, uh

Pick up the pace, turn up the bass

35,Building A Mystery,"[Verse 1]
You come out at night
That's when the energy comes
And the dark side's light
And the vampires roam
You strut your rasta wear
And your suicide poem
And a cross from a faith
That died before Jesus came
You're building a mystery

[Verse 2]
You live in a church
Where you sleep with voodoo dolls
And you won't give up the search
For the ghosts in the halls
You wear sandals in the snow
And a smile that won't wash away
Can you look out the window
Without your shadow getting in the way?
Oh you're so beautiful
With an edge and a charm
But so careful
When I'm in your arms

[Chorus]
'Cause you're working
Building a mystery
Holding on and holding it in
Yeah you're working
Building a mystery
And choosing so carefully

[Verse 3]
You woke up screaming aloud
A prayer from your secret god
You feed off our fears
And hold back your tears
Oh, give us a tantrum
And a know it all grin
Just when we need one
When the evening's thin

[Bridge]
You're so beautiful
A beautiful fucked up man
You're setting up your
Razor wire shrine

Growlin' and smilin' while in the sun
The top is down on the black Corvette
And it's fly 'cause it's sittin' on Dayton's
Laurents steering wheel, plushed out
Gold-leaf phantom top and three girls wait
Engine's blowin', the chrome is shining
Passing all the cars on the way

I'm going back to Cali, shakin' 'em, bakin' 'em
Takin' 'em to spots they never before hung
But fuck that place, on Sunset it's a trip
Where the AC's cold and the girls still strip
The record skip but this girl kept dancin'
Prancin', grindin', grinnin', romancin'
I asked her to the barn so we could hit the hay
I wanna do this, Brutus but I don't wanna pay

Advisin', realizin', she's sizin' me up
Her bikini, small heels, tall
She said, she liked the ocean
She showed me a beach, gave me a peach
And pulled out the suntan lotion
Now I thought that was fast but this girl was faster
She's lookin' for a real good time
I said, ""Close your eyes, I got a surprise""
And I ran away with the bottle of wine
I'm going back to Cali
Going back to Cali, I don't think so

And dog if you're ready then pump up ya fist in tha air
And then pray for the politicians freely; get an amen?
The last days of the last days

That's why I get high, that's why I get high
I'm holdin on to my soul
But nobody knows when it all unfolds
Then when I don't go
Remember the dead cause I all I got
I got under my arm we fall
BONE BONE muggin runnin through your door
Hoes speakin of the last time that I past
Charlie wanna hear ya BONE
But I can't go wrong
When I flip it to my song
Better turn it up
Cause you love that Thuggish Ruggish Bone, Bone, Bone
Crossroads what real cruel world
Now I doubt the journey of those lost souls
Who meant so much why wasn't I chose?
But it will not stop clones
Those shots don't drop BONE
Nooooooo no BONE
But if I could teach the world to be a thug like me
Everybody be thuggin in heaven eternally

Everyday the world goes round and round
I see it's a small world after all
Cause I can go met and I greet with my fans
Smoke a little weed and have a little laugh with y'all
But every now and then I gets caught up in a playa hation
Lord what's wrong with the nation, erase em'
But if I could teach the world to be a thug just like me
You could live your lifestyle worry free
In the arms of the Lord eternally
No mystery, but check the essence of the story
The warrior wasteland warrior so true
Divine, it's mine, east 19-99
It's where ya gonna be find'in all of my kind, every time

To be a thugsta just like me (like me)

We stand as united, but fall if divided
My thugs are the tightest
Cause God is our guidance, and they only define us
As killer and fighters, cuz the critics n writers
Backstab when they typing our story
The war to be warrior, that’s for sure
And as thugs we're more and more and more

Especially but still understood by the older folks and little kids

And the government and these playa-haters out to kill Wish
Wanna hurt this but uhuh

Artillery you can't dung with

How must I say this, if we can no more murder

Sometimes it's just hard for a nigga to wake up
It's just hard to just keep goin'
It's like I feel empty inside without you bein' here

That they truly loved (C'mon, check it out)

[Verse 1: Puff Daddy]
Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin' on the block for dough
Notorious, they got to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone, we still a team
Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream (That's right)
In the future, can't wait to see
If you open up the gates for me
Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real, feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anythin' to hear half your breath (Half your breath)
I know you still livin' your life after death

Every step I take, every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray

It's kinda hard with you not around
Know you in heaven, smilin' down
Watchin' us while we pray for you
Every day we pray for you
'Til the day we meet again
In my heart is where I'll keep you, friend
Memories give me the strength I need to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts Big I just can't define (Can't define)
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me takin' flicks
Makin' hits, stages they receive you on
Still can't believe you're gone (Can't believe you're gone)
Give anything to hear half your breath (Half your breath)
I know you still livin' your life after death

Znowu w garści trzymam prochy
I jebie mnie gdzie inni idą
Psy chcą zwęszyć nasze tropy
A ja mam oczy dookoła głowy
No i ciągle tylko smażę topy
Bo te copsy za mgłą mnie nie widzą
A ty nadal tylko walisz w nos, ty
Coś ty? W końcu będziesz inwalidą
I wiem, że moje ziomy zgarną hajs
Bo zgarną go nawet z przed nosa żydom
Wiem, że nie było nigdy łatwo nam
Bo łatwo stać, trudniej żyć przed siebie idąc
Moje ziomy to mój rap i to mój hype
Od publiki nie chcę braw, ty dawaj hajs
I choć jeszcze mnie nie znasz to będziesz znać

I pieprzę tych, których cieszy nieszczęście
I wiem, że ciągle bawię się w najlepsze
Dni dzisiejsze są lepsze
Są dużo lepsze niż wczorajsze sny
I nie zdzierżę ich min
I nie wejdę w ich film
I nie będę ich czcił
A ty rzędem, idź giń
Ja nie będę tym kimś
Bo internet ci zrył
Ja ze swym bandem sweet dreams
Gdzie beze mnie byś był
I nie przejdę obojętnie obok tego co piękne
I tak stanę pewnie obok tego co szpetne

To co dla mnie najważniejsze to po prostu myśl

45,Sunny Came Home,"[Verse 1]
Sunny came home to her favorite room
Sunny sat down in the kitchen
She opened a book and a box of tools
Sunny came home with a mission

[Chorus]
She says days go by
I'm hypnotized
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly out of my mind
Into the fire

[Verse 2]
Sunny came home with a list of names
She didn't believe in transcendence
It's time for a few small repairs she said
Sunny came home with a vengeance

She says days go by
I don't know why
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly out of my mind
Into the fire

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)

I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""

[Verse 2]
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

I got everything I wanted

You're so complicated
You hang over my shoulder when I read my mail
I don't appreciate it
When I talk to other guys

Love is a river I wanna keep flowing

At the beginning with you
We were strangers on a crazy adventure
Never dreaming how our dreams would come true
Now here we stand, unafraid of the future
At the beginning with you

Knew there was somebody somewhere
I need love in the dark
Now I know my dream will live on
I've been waiting so long
Nothing is going to tear us apart

51,Kiss The Rain,"[Verse 1]
It’s been thirty six days
And a couple hours since I saw your face
And the words you whispered left me in a daze
I've been memorizing every single phrase
You said as you walked away

An ocean in between us, can never separate us
Though we’re a million miles apart
My love goes any distance
Traveling with no resistance
I might be far away, but I've got your heart

[Chorus A]

Whenever you're in need of my arms again
Instead of looking out from the dirty window pane
Go out and kiss the rain
Go out and kiss the rain
I'm in every raindrop, never will stop now

Go out and kiss the rain (kiss, kiss, kiss the rain)
I just wanna (kiss, kiss, kiss the rain)
I just wanna (kiss, kiss, kiss the rain)

[Verse 2]
I can stay another week
Then your time is up, no longer yours to keep
And the sunshine and the rain is bittersweet
So bittersweet

An ocean in between us, can never separate us
Though we’re a million miles apart
My love goes any distance
Traveling with no resistance
I might be far away, but I've got your heart

[Chorus B]
Whenever you're in need of my arms again
Instead of looking out from the dirty window pane
Go out and kiss the rain
Go out and kiss the rain

I'm gonna have my man
I know you got nothing to say

I'm gonna have my man
Gonna steal their hearts
And save them for another day

Ain't gonna hang my hat
Ain't gonna take off my boots
Ain't nothing gonna stop me in my pursuit

My stage
Time to rehearse
Gonna see all the wonders of the universe

Pack my bags and mount my horse

Nowhere to hide
Nowhere to run

Up goes the moon
Down comes the sun
Cook my dinner while I shine my gun

Pack my bags and mount my horse
I'm gonna ride on into the next town
Spend all my money on absolutely nothing
Need no man to pay for anything

I'd give my sight to see her
I'd give my sight just to see her

So here's the way I'm gonna break it down
Speak my mind anytime
'Cause I got the master plan

Power in my soul
Strength from my hand

Won't settle by river
Might make me shiver
So look out and hide your fans
I'm a woman on fire
With huge desire
To be as good as any man

Sitting in the ghetto thinkin' 'bout
All my homies passed away (uuunnnggghhh!)
Candy painted Cadillacs and triple gold
That's how me and my boys rolled
How could it be?
Somebody took my boy from me
My best friend's gone
And I'm so all alone
And I really miss my homies
Even though you're gone away
I know you're in a better place
And I hope to see you soon someday

[Verse 1: Master P]
I used to hang with my boy, even slang with my boy
I used to bang with my boy, goddamn I miss my boy
We started out youngstas in the park throwin' birds
In your hearse, damn it's sad to see my nigga in the dirt
The game got me workin', I be perkin', never jerkin'
Still blowin' dolja fo' ya 'cause I know you're up there workin'
Your little baby's cool and ya baby's mama straight
But today's a sad day to see your t-shirts with your face
From the cradle to the grave, from the streets we used to fall
In the park you liked to ball, put yo name upon the wall
In the projects you's a legend, on the street you was a star
But it's sad to see my homeboy ridin' in that black car
A lotta soldiers done died, a lotta mothers done cried
You done took yo piece of the pie but you was too young to retire
Why soldiers ride for yo name, leave it vain
Some Gs never change, damn they killed you for some change
Smile for my homie Kevin Miller my boy Randall
The ghetto persons that lost their loved ones to these ghetto scandals

Take a minute to smile for the dead (uuunnnggghhh!)
Smile for the dead (RIP 2Pac, Makaveli, Biggie Smalls)

Even though they gone away
(I just keep reminiscin')
I know you in a better place

And I hope to see ya soon someday
(And I keep smilin', knowin' I'm a see you in the crossroads)

[Verse 2: Pimp C]
We used to grip on the grain and flip them candy toys
But I'd give up all that bullshit if I could get back my boy
Off in the club smokin' weed 'til 3, hollerin' at the hoes
Spendin' $4000 on me on gators and clothes
When I turned to rap, he had to chase the game
Nigga told me, ""C, leave that dope, 'cause rappin' is yo thang""
I ain't gon' even lie, some nights I ride and cry
Wonderin' why the real niggas always the ones to die
So I just smoke my weed and try to clear my mind
I wish that I had the power to turn back the hands of time
I wonder if there's a heaven up there for real Gs
For all the niggas in the game that be sellin' ki's
I keep my memories, try to keep my head strong
But baby it's hard to be strong, when yo main homie gone

[Chorus: Sons of Funk, Mo B. Dick, O'dell]
Even though you gone away
(Even though you gone, you ain't never gon' be forgotten)
I know you in a better place
('Cause as long as I'm here
You gon' live through me and other TRU playas)
I really miss my homies
Even though they're gone away
I know you in a better place
And I hope to see ya soon someday

[Verse 4: Silkk the Shocker]
I'm just sittin' here dazed thinkin' about all the times we had
Thinkin' about the past, some was good and some was bad
Remember Dante? It was a group of us, just a group of five
Now three dead, one in jail, it seem right now I'm the only one alive
To all my soldiers before me, may y'all rest in peace
When He took three, took my soul, just the bodies
He at the crossroads guide us out to the rest of me
Wishin' I could rewind time like demos
Me and you gettin' girls, writin' down numbers like memos
Makin' million dollar bets, makin' all our money stretch like limos
Even though I smile, it's sad, but they say gangstas can't cry
But if I close my eyes and visualize me together then I suddenly wanna smile
See you laid down when it's yo time, when your time was up
You never seen your child, but he's here to remind us
Even though you was wrong, I never could believe that that was true
You was with me forever, you could check my rest in peace tattoos
See me and P and C forever gon be ridin' and thuggin'
Rest in peace to all the ones that didn't make it
And rest in peace to my brother
We gon' miss you

I am a poster girl with no poster
I am 32 flavors and then some
And I'm beyond your peripheral vision
So you might want to turn your head
Cause someday you are gonna get hungry
And eat most of the words you just said

[Verse 2]
Both my parents taught me about goodwill
And I have done well by their names
Just the kindness I've lavished on strangers
Is more than I can explain
Still there's many who've turned out their porch lights
Just so I would think they were not home
And hid in the dark of their windows
Till I'd passed and left them alone

[Verse 3]
God help you if you are an ugly girl
Course, too pretty is also your doom
Cause everyone harbors a secret hatred
For the prettiest girl in the room
And God help you if you are a phoenix
And you dare to rise up from the ash
A thousand eyes will smolder with jealousy
While you are just flying past

[Verse 4]
And I'll never try to give my life meaning
By demeaning you
But I would like to state for the record
I did everything that I could do
I'm not saying that I am a saint
I just don't want to live that way
No, I will never be a saint
But I will always say

Still waters run deep

We can lean on each other
This is all we need to know

Well, I admit I've been a fool sometimes
I believe I may be losing you
It's now or never, we talk before a tear is shed
Under your spell and over my head
You took me in your arms, and you told me
We don't need to worry
But you, you never say your sorry

Keep this love alive for us, it's all I feel
How can we survive if we change what is real

Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
No one wins, and losers weep
Reflection will show this connection

I see the angel and the devil in your heart
I confess, either one is my addiction
And where you're leading me
I don't have the will to fight
Out of the darkness and into the light
But living in your arms, I can take it
Please don't make me shiver
I know together we deliver

Let the gods decide who finds the sweetest thrill
Who can justify the truth, God, I love you still

Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
No one wins, and losers weep
Deception will show
It's a struggle when you're starved for affection

You've got a stranger on your mind
The dream is free
I know I'm only human if I cry
Or maybe we should kiss and say goodbye

[Chorus] (x2)
Still waters run deep
Just remember when we lie to each other
No one wins, and losers weep
Deception will show
It's a struggle when you're starved for affection

(Talking) Back again...It's the jankiest the jankiest
Still gettin' my stalk on walk on

[Verse 1: W.C]
One of the G'est WSC riders
One about the Feds on camera with the folded bandanna
It's me the D- U- B- C Nighttrain sipper
Two fingers split I'mma get her once again I bring her
Skip skip throw it up throw it up give it up or get rolled up
Swole up thought I told ya 'bout this Maad Circle Soldier
Allstars locs pieces khakis and linens
The OG Godfather with the blue feather in it
The shadiest nigga what's crackin' who got the sack and
Nigga what they goin' for everybody's on the floor
Make way for the loccest cutthroat with a beard long as Moses
Walkin' through yo camps and striking penitentiary poses
A straight vet Connect Gang is my set
Since a rook I did everything in the book
Puttin' those thangs on ya like bing bing when I get ya
Loc this rap game ain't ready for a real cap nigga

[Hook 2x]
Not just clownin' we got thousands
Still out bangin' the streets
Playas get jacked from thinkin' I'm acting
Y'all can't see WC..

[Verse 2: W.C]
Now bow to the shadiest hood patrollin' west rollin'
7 figure nigga still hi fi growin'
Pistol holdin' bailin' with nothing but trues
Jumping out the fo' in the corduroy house shoes
WC a G been in these streets for years
Been loccin' since the Force MD's were singing ""Tears""
Now what the fuck a new nigga got to say to me
I was pullin' 211's when KDAY was the Beat
1984 Lo Cali Sports Arena
At Uncle Jamms Army jackin' fools for Filas
When Run DMC and Jam Master first bust
We was snatchin' mothafuckas outta Nissan trucks
Raised from a crew of real killers and knick kickers
That never ran on ya but was quick to put them hands on ya
(Talking) Ha ha Man y'all better figure us out quick
Ain't no rappers here we felons trying to make money at this here

[Hook]

[Verse 3: W.C]
It's the cap peeler night grinder west rider hood ratacider
Deuce 4 7 all day everyday
4 deep hittin' corners in a rag Chevrolet
Started out minor before I turned major, used to do it for free
But now I ride for the paper
Maad Circle hit 'em up like bam
Where y'all from them enemies don't act dumb
Y'all know where we from
It's that 15th letter 2 times with the S
Cut off Dickie wearing descendant from the West
Steady square dumping in the center where the crowd
With my flag on my head tied Aunt Jemima style
But ain't nobody trippin' cause we all about the ends
Plus fool I don't set trip I set trends
Now after this I'm givin' y'all about a year
We gone see how many niggas grow braids in they beard

58,You Light Up My Life,"[Verse 1]
So many nights
I'd sit by my window
Waiting for someone
To sing me his song

So many dreams
I've kept deep inside me
Alone in the dark
But now you've come along

[Chorus]
And you
Light up my life
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights
With song

[Verse 2]
Rolling at sea
Adrift on the water
Could it be finally
I'm turning for home?
Finally, a chance
To say, ""Hey, I love you,""
Never again
To be all alone

[Chorus] x2

60,Backyard Boogie,"Yeah, yeah, yeah

Verse One:

Saturday morning at the crack of sunrise
Thank the man upstairs for lettin' me open my eyes
It's a whole new game for me like T-Lee
It's nine-seven now and I'ma stay sucka free
Thinkin' about all my homeboys behind bars
As I crease up my khakis and lace up my stars
And everythang is straight I'm in the full zone
Gettin' paper every day, it's all I'm trippin' on
'Cause ain't nothin' like a rag in Californ-i-a
With the top back, rollin' on a hot sunny day
It's one-oh, fo'-sho', and I'm clownin' all the rookies
With a pocket full of cookies
And mashi'n to the backyard boogie

[Ice Cube]
Get yo' boogie on [repeat 3X]

Chorus:

And then we comin' wit that
Backyard boogie oogie oogie (yeah)
Backyard boogie oogie oogie (it's all about that)
Backyard boogie oogie oogie (unh)
Backyard boogie oogie oogie (it's the backyard boogie) [repeat 3X]
Backyard boogie oogie oogie [repeat 2X]

Verse Two:
Now just throw yo hands up high in the sky
Representin' where you from cause it's West till I die
Put it down anywhere, take thangs for what they worth
Been a rider since birth, and the earth is my turf
So I bails in the party, everythang is cool
It's niggas in the hood I ain't seen since high school
And everybody gots stripes cause we all paid dues
Crips, Damus, and other clicks and crews
Just gettin' they boogie on, hoochie bitches gettin' loose
It kinda remind me of the truce in nine-deuce
I'm even kickin' back, and I'm usually chicken hawkin
The Bloods shootin' dice, and the Crips are C-walkin
Now the party is jumpin', and the crowd's gettin' bigger
Looked up and saw four hoes to every nigga
And it's off the hook, got ya grindin' and humpin'
'Cause the backyard boogie be bumpin'

(Unh, straight from Inglewood, and you know that it's all good
You can put that on yo' hood, everyday
And we comin with that)

Chorus

Verse Three

Now it's out of control, and everywhere you look
Ain't nothin' but real niggas, the bustas got shook
And everybody left with the whole hustla bang
And Daisy Dukes and khakis do seem to be the thang
You choose or you lose while you conversatin'
Enough cock to go around, so ain't no playa hatin'
I want homegirl over there in red
Cause Baby Got Backs like Mix-a-Lot said
When I keep my composure, kick back like a pro
Cause Mack one-oh just refuse to save a ho
But it's a done deal, locked up throw away the key
'Cause she gonna leave a backyard boogie with me

(Get yo' boogie on, yeah
Get yo' boogie on, Inglewood
Get yo' boogie on, Inglewood, pause
Get yo' backyard boogie on)

And as long as I may live
Ooh, you're...

[Verse 1: Big Pun]
Yo, I ain't a player, I just fuck a lot
Jump on top of my dick and work them hips until I bust a shot
It doesn't stop, I'm only beginnin', I'm bonin' your women
While you home all alone, I'm blowin' up in 'em
Sendin' them back to you, mad at you
Don't catch a motherfuckin' attitude
I'm just showin' you how this rapper do
Capital Punishment, when I'm up in it, suckin' it
Bustin' it out—nice blouse, let me unbutton it
You're fuckin' with King Papi Chulo when knockin' culo
Pop your mulos out the socket tryin' to ride with the sumo
You know my rise is high, word, I be drillin' 'em
Bitches be tryin' to ride, but the curve be killin' 'em
Fillin' 'em with the cash, my cheese premium unleaded
Come get it, first work the tongue, then let the Pun hit it
Split it in half, watch the gat, baby, take a bath
Be good, I might put away the wood and give you the mustache

I bang a stranger in my torture chamber
Feed the locas chocha pinga
While I force my finger where my bolas linger
I bring the pain like Method when I flex and flip the coochie
Puerto Rican to the core, but no Boriquas eat the pussy
'Scuse me for bein' blunt, but I've been eatin' cunts
Since pimps was pushin' pink Caddies with the fish tank pumps
Bumpin' and grindin', simultaneously grindin'
Climbin' up the walls, with my balls bangin' off your hymen
I'm a diamond in the rough, (ugh) bustin' in your face
Taste the sweetness of my dick, rip your fetus out of place
Yo, bitches already know the repertoire
Step in my car, let's start the ménage à trois, like Escobar
By far, I'm the best at all sex positions, forget the kissin'
I'm skippin' the tongue-twistin', TS Tradition

[Verse 3: Big Punisher]
Some chick in back of me, bought me a daiquiri
Told me meet her in back of Zachary's
'Cause she heard I was packin' meat
I bagged the freak and hit the telly
Got the Phillies, lifted her belly
And ""Put it in Her Mouth,"" like Akinyele
Far from ugly but they used to say I'm too chubby
But since the money the honeys got nothin' but love for me
So rub my tummy and make a wish, I'll make you rich
Take your kids to the flicks, come back and fix your favorite dish
(Not!) You crazy bitch, I ain't with that, I'ma hit that
Split back to the shack where my other chicks at
Now can you dig that? I'm the mack, doin' my thing
Pullin' your strings, makin' you feel like you in a dream
It's the king of the Hip-Hop Quotables, givin' you multiples
Just by the tone of my voice in the vocal booth
I notice you doin' your thing with your crew
Is it aight if I come down there and sing to you?

[Chorus: The O'Jays & Big Punisher]
You're my darlin' darlin' baby

Tell me do you ever think of us?
Should I ask for more or should I stop?

What if a tomorrow means that we are here together?
What if we are taking chances just to lose it all?
Am I really crazy thinking 'bout this all together?
What if I've been missing the writing on the wall?

I hear everything they saying, saying 'bout us
It's not about right or wrong, it's about what we love
Would it be simple or would it be too complicated?
Should I keep going or maybe it's better to stop?

66,Santa's A Fat Bitch,"Sleigh bells jingle-ling rin jing jingle-ling
Horses, horses, horses, horses
Sleigh bells jingle-ling ring jing jingle-ling

(gunshot)

Santa Claus suck my balls
Drunk as hell rinking bells at the malls
Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, and Cupid
I'm a get stupid, ha ha ha, eh
I sat around all night under the chimney
Holdin my sack like ""gimme gimme""
I know that he's commin, he's commin he must
Lookin up nuthin but rust, dust
Turn on my tv the very next day I see your gettin payed
Leadin the parade I'm that sniper on the buildin
Listen to my nine go click, Santas a fat bitch

Santa Claus is a fat bitch
(Santa Claus is a fat fat bitch)
Another year and I ain't get shit
(Another year I ain't get shit)
If I hear him land on my roof
(Ohh my undertaker)
I'm a bust your ass in the too-hoo-hoo-hoo-hooth

Yeah I got somthin to say about St. Nick
Fuck that ho, he never brought Shaggs shit
No toys, candy canes, just a lump of coal
So I eat it, cuz there ain't nuttin in the cupboards
So I'll be quick, quick and brief
Alls I need for Christmas is my two front teeth
I got mine kicked, kicked out my mouth
I need a few new ones could you help me out?
Should've known I'd get the short end of the stick
No kind of gift I didn't get shit
Some say I was bad but that wasn't it
It's all because, Santa's a fat bitch

Santa Claus is a fat bitch
(Santa fuck you 'cause you're a ho)
Another year and I ain't got shit
(Another year I ain't get shit)
If I hear him land on my roof
I'm a bust your ass in the too-hoo-hoo-hoo-hooth

""Oh-ho-ho don't go that way Rudolph! That's the ghetto!
Ho-ho, those boys and girls don't deserve anything.""

Santa Claus, Santa Claus where you been?
I see you got cookies and milk on your chin
I guess you had time to collect your ends
You always been down for your rich friends
But Rudolph, he don't bring his sleigh my way
Nothing but coal and dirt for little J
I guess you couldn't fit down my chimney shaft
You need to lose some of that fat ass, eh
All the little rich boys they gettin paid
Counting the toys and ducats they made
Me? I got a little half little chunk of dog shit
I'm a kill that fat bitch

Santa Claus is a fat bitch
(He ate too much McDonald's)
Another year and I ain't get shit
(Mrs. Claus is a ho)
If I hear him land on my roof
(Slice that bitch in the big red coat)
I'm a bust your ass in the too-hoo-hoo-hoo-hooth

T'was the night before Christmas and everythings whack
Not a creature stirring but a fucking rat
I ain't hearin jingle bells I ain't hearin nuttin
Ain't smelling no turky sure as hell ain't no stuffing
All that I paid, wished and prayed
That fat motherfucker would swing my way
And drop off soldiers and rubber balls
But I woke up and found some crusty old drawers
Yep, yep I knew it! The shaft again, and again, and again, and again
Every year I wake up to the same old shit... house empty
No sign of the fat bitch!

Santa Claus is a fat bitch
(Santa Claus is a fat bitch)
Another year and I ain't get shit
(Another year I ain't get shit)
If I hear him land on my roof
(If I hear him land on my roof)
I'm a bust your ass in the too-hoo-hoo-hoo-hooth

Santa Claus is a fat bitch
(Santa Claus is a fat bitch)
Another year and I ain't get shit
(I ain't ge-et shi-it)
If I hear him land on my roof
(Ro-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoof)
I'm a bust your ass in the too-hoo-hoo-hoo-hooth

(record scratching)
""He's got a fuzzy white beard and a great big smile
A bright red hat you can see for a mile
A bag full of goodies and a great big grin
Here comes Santa Claus again.""",Insane Clown Posse,1997,[67],1
67,Tuck Me In,"Ooh, hoo, hoo
Oh, hey

[Verse 1:]
After spending my whole weekend
Kicking back with all my friends
Think my battery has run out
But I fight to raise my hand

And I get a little nervous
Watching day turn into night
Read another bedtime story
Before you turn out the light

[Chorus:]
Tuck me in
And hold me real right
That`s the only way I`ll know
Everything is gonna be alright

Tuck me in
Before you tell me goodnight
That`s the only way I`ll know
Everything is gonna be just fine

[Verse 2:]
You wonder why I get so nervous
Wonder why I get so scared
Friend of mine I used to hang with
Has an address way up there

She was minding her own business
Trying to have herself a little fun
And she never knew what hit her
She never saw tomorrow come

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
And I wake up in the middle
In the middle of the night
I just can`t sleep
So I hold my pillow tight

Counting backwards from a hundred
Only get to ninety-nine
When I call out to you
Tuck me in one more time

[Chorus:]
Tuck me in
Hold me tight
Don`t let go until the morning light
(Won`t you)

Tuck me in
Hold me tight
Don`t let go until the morning light

Tuck me in
(Tuck me in, yeah)
And hold me real right
(Oh, no, no, no, no, oh…)
That`s the only way I`ll know
(No, no, no, no)
Everything is gonna be alright
(No, no)

Tuck me in
(Where`s my ring? Yeah)
Hold me tight
Don`t let go until the morning light

Tuck me in
Hold me tight
Don`t let go until the morning light
(Tuck me in)

Tuck me in
Hold me tight",Kimberly Scott,1997,"[68, 69, 76]",3

(C'mon) Bad Boy
We don't stop
(We rock, we rock, yo)
Yo

[Verse 1: Ma$e]
I hit you with the sound that the world can't take
Came straight out the gate playing 2.8
Real studded jewel funded
Got to love it
First rap cat with the R&B budget
Every day on the TV me and PD
Girl's so pretty, make their man break the CD
Why y'all forever rowdy
I be out here somewhere in Maui
Till I go back to Cali

[Verse 1: Brian McKnight]
Can't understand
How he can treat you the way that he does
Give me the chance to show you, baby
You're better off with me

[Pre-Chorus: Brian McKnight, (Kelly Price)]
(Ohh ohh ohh, so will you let me try)
(I wanna make you smile)
I wanna love you like you need to be loved
(I'll never let you down)
(I'll always be around)
And you should be mine

((Don't waste your time))
(Don't waste your time)
Don't baby
((If he don't treat you like he should))
No, baby
((Then you should be mine))
You should be mine, baby

[Verse 2: Brian McKnight]
Why can't you see
You should be happy
And I don't know why
You don't believe a man can love you
For the rest of your life

I wanna love you like you need to be loved

You should be mine, ohh ohh

[Verse 3: Ma$e (Brian McKnight)]
Yo!
What the deal, honey?
Insecure feel funny
I know you're used to dealin' with cats with real money
Plus I know you're like Ma$e in a lot of ways
But it's hard to go on when you're lonely in the holidays
When you shopping
Did you shop for 2?
Uh!
Take you where the waters aqua blue
Let you fall back
Treat you like you're all that
Under umbrellas with your shades and your straw hat

You ain't the one out clubbing all day and all night
Just to save a fight
Or say he's right
And I know he ain't the cat that'll stay in you life
Even though he gave you ice now make'm your wife (yeah)
How a man deserve you if he hurt you?
Then he give a woman 25 a curfew
Between me and you
You ain't heard that from me
Cuz Ma$e ain't the player with the PhD

[Bridge: Brian McKnight, ((all))]
Girl, come into my world
((I love you the way that you need to be loved))
No worries, no more ((ooh ooh))
Girl, open the door

[Verse 1]
You and I go hard at each other like we're going to war
You and I go rough, we keep throwing things and slamming the doors
You and I get so damn dysfunctional, we stopped keeping score
You and I get sick, yeah, I know that we can't do this no more

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah but baby, there you go again, there you go again, making me love you
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head
Let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo

So I cross my heart, and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I've said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night

[Verse 2]
Try to tell you ""no"", but my body keeps on telling you ""yes""
Try to tell you ""stop"", but your lipstick got me so out of breath

And she said... “You a goddamn lie”
I ain't mean to say that shit, girl, I was goddamn high
So we left the crib now we in the goddamn ride
She lookin' goddamn fine
I wanted a bitch who was down to Earth
But she want the goddamn sky, uh
List of my problems
Got this one on my line that won't stop fucking callin'
It's crazy I made her that way
Every time I see her out, I see the hate in her face
Like why you do that?
Tell her you love her when next week you just want your space
Why you do, why you do that?
Tell her you want her but next week you do your own thing
Why you do, why you do that?
I can't explain it but just know it working for me
She text me “I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you”
But how the fuck can you hate me?
When I ain't did shit, but be the real thang
She know I'm the real, that'll never change
I never been the one to try to explain

Now I'm like
It's a goddamn shame
We done crashed, we done burned
But baby you the goddamn blame
See I wanted love but you wanted goddamn fame
Every goddamn thang
I wanted a bitch who was on the move
But you want to goddamn lay
Uh, list of my problems
Got this one in my bed and she just wants to sleep
Fucking up all of the sheets
She only wake up to eat
Do this shit every week
Like, why you do that?
Crying you want to be great, but sleepin' until the next day
Why you do that?
Don't got that much in the bank, we go out she order the steak
Why you do, why you do that?
She can't explain it but just know it working for her
She claiming she down on her luck but really she don't give a fuck
And I cannot make this shit up
And I ain't did shit but be the real thang
She know I'm the real, that'll never change

75,Something That We Do,"[Verse 1]
I remember well the day we wed
I can see that picture in my head
I still believe the words we said
Forever will ring true
Love is certain, love is kind
Love is yours and love is mine
But it isn't somethin' that we find
It's somethin' that we do

[Verse 2]
It's holding tight, It's lettin' go
It's flyin' high and layin' low
It lets your strongest feelin's show
And your weakness too
It's a little and a lot to ask
An endless and a welcome task
Love isn't somethin' that we have
It's somethin' that we do

[Chorus]
We help to make each other all that we can be
Though we can find our strength and inspiration, independently
The way we work together is what sets our love apart
So closely that we can't tell where I end and where you start

[Verse 3]
It gives me heart remembering how
We started with a simple vow
There's so much to look back on now
Still it feels brand new
We're on a road that has no end
And each day we begin again
Love's not just somethin' that we're in
It's somethin' that we do

[Chorus]
We help to make each other all that we can be
We can find our strength and inspiration, independently
The way we work together is what sets our love apart
So closely that we can't tell where I end and where you start

[Verse 4]
Love is wide, love is long
Love is deep and love is strong
Love is why I love this song
And I hope you love it too
I remember well the day we wed
I can see that picture in my head
Love isn't just those words we said
It's somethin' that we do

It's gonna be alright, you gotta believe dat

[Verse 1: Treach]
Dear God times are changing and the weather got hot
Over the past year a lot of niggas went pop drop
So I thank you for my life and all that I got
I wanna praise you and drop off a message to Pac
I was sittin' here lookin' at your picture my nigga
Puttin' hash with the weed wit a mixture of liqour
We can't kick it you ain't wit us is the shit I can't figure
Nigga I miss ya this thug gonna miss ya till I'm wit cha'
It was 90 on the P.E. tour when we mashed down
Don't even seem like 7 years passed
Both rodies now homies out the hood on the scene
You did the humpty with D.U. I did the walk with the queen
Was a dream smokin' and drinkin' through our per diem
Stealin' backstage passes to hit ho's and coliseums
Found hoes to flip up make them lift they shit up
Get it then get up looking to chicks up and switch up
Think of all the times that I rolled wit mine
Male groupies got dissed and got the hell out of dodge
They was blinded when the good shined through they were on you
Just know I'm gon' mourn you till I join you

[Chorus]
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I hope you here me now in god we trust
Even all the prayers can't bring you back to us
I'll mourn you till I join you cause I'll keep in touch

[Verse 2: Treach]
We was two lil niggas both skinny and broke
Happy if we scrap pennies for smokes
Tours over we were out yeah and you called with the news
You was over in New York to film this movie called Juice
Called you back up you told me pack up
Me and you and Stretch could shack up
The thug luv back up the act up
Shock, Hakeem and  ain't true would call and fuss cause they know we all kicked up dust
You remember when the cabby said daddy wouldn't pick up our RACE
You beat his ass then you spit in his face
I remember on the set from the trailer fiends stole your jewels
And Big Stretch punched him out his shoes
Back then I was taking stashes quick who holdin'
That's when every piece of bud I was rolling was stolen
We would laugh at the jacks over six-packs and yacks
Spit the emos over demos thinkin' ladies and limos
Youse a wild motherfucker who could never sit still
Said you wouldn't rest until you saw a mill
Nigga I felt you
We was back an' forth borough to projects for forts
Damn I wish they knew how much you loved new york
Shit and can't nobody dis my nigga
Motha fuck that I miss my nigga
I'm a mourn you till I join you

You ain't got to worry about how long I'm gonna mourn ya
I'm gonna keep your name on the streets

I'll mourn you till I join you cause I'll keep in touch

[Verse 3: Treach]
I'm ya true motherfucker thug nation alert
Keep his name on the street til ya lay in the dirt
This shit hurt cause we went from poor to rich
You're supposed to see a lot more than this
They brought you up locked you up when you did above the rim
They let you out you called us up we came as thugs again
We would hear ""ah-ha rapist"" they shout
Ya'll was talking shit that ya'll didn't know a damn thang bout
You was going through your stress while your enemies laughed
Ain't never take no shit and 2Pac never took no ass
Fuck the press fuck the world life goes on when you die
Fuck the court fuck the judge and every bitch that lied
A little time ticked by, my ho and I got rocked
My lady waking me up yelling Treach, Pac got shot
Soon as I get there I find Afeni urging' me
Saying convince my baby, don't leave after surgery
So I'm looking in her eyes while they walking me through
Thinking Pac hard head what the hell I'ma do
So we kicked it as they stayed and I asked what you need
You say a pound for comin nigga and a hit of some weed
So I asked you not to go over and over god knows
You just smiled and said nigga help me get on my clothes
So we got over that, you healed up got locked
I dropped case about lights, they had you caged when I stopped
Yeah the chain remains plus you a part of my link
They fucked up by givin' you too much time to think
I remember your release and we met up in LA
At the billiard getting blazed Henny'd out with the hay
After that you blew up a made nigga platinum plus
Addicted to drama a soldier with a nation of thugs
Now we in these savage ages
Even you yourself predicted that last night in vegas
I heard gats were brandished, my nigga once again damaged
And a part of this heart right here in Venice
At the same time, you was both loved and feared
M.O.B. the fuckin' thug of the year
I'm a mourn you til I join you

[Chorus]
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I hope you here me now in god we trust
Even all the prayers can't bring you back to us
I'll mourn you till I join you cause I'll keep in touch

78,I Wonder If Heaven Got A Ghetto,"[Chorus]
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

[Verse 1]
I was raised, a little young nigga doin' bad shit
Talk much shit, ‘cause I never had shit
I could remember being whupped in class
And if I didn't pass, Mama whupped my ass
Was it my fault Papa didn't plan it out?
Broke out, left me to be the man of the house
I couldn't take it, had to make a profit
Found a block, got a Glock, and I clock grips
Makin' G's was my mission
Movin' enough of this shit to get my mama out the kitchen
And why must I sock a fella
Just to live large like Rockefeller?
First you didn't give a fuck, but you're learnin' now
If you don't respect the town then we'll burn you down
Goddamn, it's a motherfuckin' riot
Black people on a rage, police, so don't try it
If you're not from the town then don't pass through
‘Cause some O.G. fools might blast you
It ain't right, but it's long overdue
We can't have peace 'til the niggas get a piece too
I want G's so you label me a criminal
And if I die, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

[Chorus]
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

[Verse 2]
Here on Earth, tell me what's a black life worth?
A bottle of juice is no excuse, the truth hurts
And even when you take the shit
Move counties, get a lawyer, you can shake the shit
Ask Rodney, Latasha, and many more
It's been going on for years, there's plenty more
When they ask me, ""When will the violence cease?""
When your troops stop shootin' niggas down in the street
Niggas had enough, time to make a difference
Bear witness, own our own business
Fuck the guard, ‘cause it's hard tryin' to make ends meet
First we couldn't afford shit, now everything's free
So we loot, please don't shoot when you see
I'm takin' from them ‘cause for years they would take from me
Now the tables have turned around
You didn't listen, until the niggas burned it down, huh
And now Bush can't stop the hit
I predicted the shit in 2Pacalypse
And for once I was down with niggas
Felt good in the hood being around the niggas
Yeah, and for the first time everybody let go
And the streets is death row
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

[Hook]
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
Yeah, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

[Verse 3]
I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it take to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
‘Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And the only time we deal is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And though it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready to have a black President
Huh, it ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
The Penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
I wake up in the mornin' and I ask myself:
Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?
I'm tired of being poor and, even worse, I'm black
My stomach hurts, so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
Mo' nigga, mo' nigga, mo' niggas
Rather I'd be a dead than a po' nigga
Let the Lord judge the criminals
If I die, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

[Chorus]
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
And I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
(Just think if niggas decide to retaliate)
(Soulja in the house)

79,Deja Vu [Uptown Baby],"[Produced by KNS]

[Peter Gunz]
New York to the heart, but got love for all
Lie and die in the fire, where I learned to ball
Uptown is the place where I lay my dome
On the streets of the Bronx where my family roam
Ho damn it, we home, Peter got a nine millimeter
Playa haters can feel the flame from my heater
I never really liked to play a fool like that
But I love to succeed and see foes fall flat
Splat, like deja vu
And I got another clip that'll daze y'all crew
I sip Cristal, Dom P, Mo' with pist-al
Just cause I'm pissy, don't mean you should misdoubt
Keep em near da fifties and, hundreds all arranged
Anything less than that, you keep the change
Not filthy rich, but bitch I'm barely broke
Blessed with flows that keep you hooked like dope
Friends call me Gunz, sons call me trife
Cause I'm quick to slide off and slide this dick up in your wife
And that's life, you should learn how to treat her
I guarantee Peter, knows how to eat her
And beat her, niggas in the Bronx call me Lex
Cause I push a Lex, and I rock a Rolex
And I lounge on Lex, and I love sex
And I wave techs on sets that be tryin to flex
Like Dex, nigga God rest your soul
But when you're playin cards for Gunz, it ain't no time to fold

[Pre-Hook: Peter Gunz]
New York niggas got crazy game
But outta town niggas is all the same
Brooklyn niggas get crazy loot
That's because when it's beef they ain't scared to shoot
Harlem niggas know how to play
Mack the 600, getting crazy pay
Niggas outta Queens got shit on lock
Strapped with the Glock, running up in your spot

[Hook: Lord Tariq (Peter Gunz)]
But if it wasn't for the Bronx
This rap shit probably never would be going on
So tell me where you from
(Uptown baby, uptown baby
We gets down baby, up for the crown baby)
Now if it wasn't for the Bronx
This rap shit probably never would be going on
So tell me where you from
(Uptown baby, uptown baby
We gets down baby, up for the crown baby)

[Lord Tariq]
Yo the RM-80, is parked in the lot
Right next to the Mercedes, keep the heat cocked
For these blocks that are shady, you're crazy if you walk around
Thinking shit's gravy; stop me? Maybe
I'm livin life lawless, makin big investments
On them 8-class flawless, and hoes call us
I'm comfortable like Recaro, two quarters of my life
Walkin roads type narrow, deep thoughts which I abide by
Puffin high, got my mind's eye, points sharper
Than an arrow gettin high, keep your eye on the sparrow
Riches like the pharaoh, bought a new five
With the snitches for these hoes, trunk full of ammo
Keep my toast closer than most niggas keep they own shadow
And I strap for my foes like a saddle
I rock stones, other niggas rock gravel
Talk shit? Whatever have you, I'm from Soundview
Bronx most wanted, front get confronted
Playa, we rollin deep in the one point five hundreds
Like Big I., red eyed, mad blunted
You step outside and get blooded have your whole block flooded
With the Bronx it's a warnin, stormin guns out
From dusk 'til dawn and it's on, no doubt
Keep a eye on yo' bitch when I'm roamin about
And put a eye on yo' lip nigga, watch yo' mouth
I'm from the Bronx, wipe yo' feet when you step in my house
Cause you's a small-time nigga, bout a half an ounce now

[Pre-Hook: Peter Gunz]
New York niggas got crazy game
But outta town niggas is all the same
Brooklyn niggas get crazy loot
That's because when it's beef they ain't scared to shoot
Harlem niggas know how to play
Mack the 600, getting crazy pay
Niggas outta Queens got shit on lock
Strapped with the Glock, running up in your spot

[Hook: Lord Tariq (Peter Gunz)]

All around the world, we could make time
Rompin' and a-stompin' 'cause I'm in my prime
Born in the North and sworn to entertain ya
'Cause I'm down for the state of Pennsylvania
I try not to whine, but I must warn ya
'Bout the motherfuckin' girls from California
Alabama baby said ""Hallelujah""
Good God, girl, I wish I knew ya

[Chorus]
I know, I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know, I know it's you
You say ""Hello"" and then I say ""Adieu""

[Verse 2]
Come back, baby, 'cause I'd like to say
I've been around the world, back from Bombay
Fox hole love, pie in your face
Living in and out of a big fat suitcase
Bonafide ride, step aside, Mike Johnson
Yes, I could, in the woods of Wisconsin
Wake up the cake, it's a lake she's kissin' me
As they do when they do in Sicily

[Chorus]
I know, I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know, I know it's you
You say ""Hello"" and then I say ""Adieu""

[Verse 3]
Where you want to go, who you want to be
What you want to do, just come with me
I saw God and I saw the fountains
You and me, girl, sittin' in the Swiss mountains
Me Oh My O, me and Guy O
Freer than a bird 'cause we're rocking Ohio
Around the world, I feel dutiful
Take a wife 'cause life is beautiful

[Chorus]
I know, I know for sure
Ding, dang, dong, dong, deng, deng, dong, dong, ding, dang
I know, I know it's you
Ding, dang, dong, dong, deng, deng, dong, dong, ding, dang
Mother Russia, do not suffer, I know you're bold enough
I've been around the world and I have seen your love
I know, I know it's you
You say ""Hello"" and then I say ""Adieu""

Lookin' for a man that would do me right
First move that I made was on the dance floor
But got down one time, then I went down for mo'

'Cause of the beat, just my luck
That somebody else will scoop him up

Can't have that
Wanna be that girl that
Find herself a perfect match
Didn't wanna come off as bein' too fly

Got contact eye-to-eye
Then I walked over to him slowly
I know that you don't know me
But this might be my only shot at

A tenderoni, he told me that we can do this
'Cause a girl like you, I can't resist

86,All Of My Days,"Well I have been searching all of my days
All of my days
Many a road, you know
I've been walking on
All of my days
And I've been trying to find
What's been in my mind
As the days keep turning into night

Well, I have been quietly standing in the shade
All of my days
Watch the sky breaking on the promise that we made
All of this rain
And I've been trying to find
What's been in my mind
As the days keep turning into night

Well, many a night I found myself with no friends standing near
All of my days
I cried aloud
I shook my hands
What am I doing here?
All of these days
For I look around me
And my eyes confound me
And it's just too bright
As the days keep turning into night

Now, I see clearly
It's you I'm looking for
All of my days
Soon I'll smile
I know I'll feel this loneliness no more
All of my days
For I look around me
And it seems He found me
And it's coming into sight
As the days keep turning into night
As the days keep turning into night
And even breathing feels all right
Yes, even breathing feels all right
Now even breathing feels all right
It's even breathing
Feels all right",Alexi Murdoch,1997,"[87, 78, 65, 65, 69, 88, 88, 88]",8
87,You Know My Steez,"[Guru talking]
That makes me know that what we're doing
We had the right idea in the beginning
And and we just need to maintain our focus and elevate
We what we do we update our formulas
We have certain formulas but we update em (oh right)
With the times and everything y'know
So y'know the rhyme style is elevated
The style of beats is elevated but it's still Guru and Premier
And it's always a message involved

[Intro]
The real (The real)
Hip-hop (Hip-hop)
MCing(MCing), and
DJing (DJing), from your own mind (from your own mind,)
You know? (you know?)
I, I guess right now we should start the show

[Verse 1: Guru]
Who's the suspicious character
Strapped with the sounds profound
Similar to rounds spit by Derringers
You're in the Terrordome, like my man Chuck D said
It's time to dethrone you clones and all you knuckleheads
‘Cause MC's have used up extended warranties
While real MC's and DJ's are a minority
But right about now, I use my authority
‘Cause I'm like the Wizard, and you look lost like Dorothy
The horror be when I return for my real people
Words that split wigs hitting like some double Desert Eagles
Sporting caps pulled low, and baggy slacks
Subtracting all the rappers who lack over Premier's tracks
Severe facts have brought this rap game to near collapse
So as I have in the past, I whoop ass
Dropping lyrics that be hotter than sex and candlewax
And one-dimensional MC's can't handle that
While the world's revolving, on its axis
I come with mad love and plus the illest warlike tactics
The wilderness is filled with this
So many people searching for false bliss
I'm here with the skills you've missed
The rejected stone is now the cornerstone
Sort of like the master builder when I make my way home
You know my steez

[Hook]
You know my steez
Let 'em know, do your thing, God
Keep it live (Keep it live, Keep it live)
To the beat y'all

[Verse 2]
The beat is sinister, Primo makes you relax
I'm like the minister, when I be lacing the wax
I be bringing salvation through the way that I rap
And you know, and I know, I'm nice like that
Work through worldly problems, I got the healing power
When the mic's within my reach, I'm feeling more power
Stealing at least three minutes of every rap radio hour
It's often easier for one to give advice
Than it is for a person to run one's own life
That's why I can't be caught up in all the hype
I keep my soul tight and let these lines take flight
The apparatus gets blessed
And suckers get put to rest
No more of the unpure, I got the cure for this mess
The wackness is spreading like the plague
MC's lucked up and got paid
But still can't make the fucking grade
How many times are wannabe's gonna lie?
Yo, they must wanna fry
They can't touch the knowledge I personify
I travel through the darkness, carrying my torch
The illest soldier, when I'm holding down the fort
You know my steez
(You know my steez)

[Hook]
Let em know, do your thing, God
Keep it live (Keep it live)
You know my steez
Let em know, do your thing, God
Keep it live (Keep it live)
You know my steez
Let em know, do your thing, God
Keep it live (Keep it live)
You know my steez
Let em know, do your thing, God
Keep it live (Keep it live)
The mic

[Verse 3]
On the microphone, you know that I'm one of the best yet
Some punks ain't paid all of their debts yet
Trying to be fly, riding high on the jet-set
With juvenile rhymes, making fake-ass death threats
Big deal, like En Vogue, here's something you can feel
Styles more tangible, and image more real
For some time now, I've held the scrolls and manuscripts
When it's time to go all out you be like, ""Damn, he flipped!""
Now I'm sick, fed up with the bullshit
Got the lyrical full clip, giving you a verbal asswhip
Don't trip, it's the gifted prolific one
Known as Bald Head Slick  why is the press all on my di-dick?
My style be wilder than a kamikaze pilot
Don't try it, I'm about to start more than a frigging riot
Styles unsurpassable, and nuccas that's suckas
Yo, them motherfuckers are harrassable
For I be speaking from my parables and carry you beyond
The mic's either a magic wand
Or it gets tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb
Then I grab your palm, no pulse, you're gone
And if you thought we'd lose our niche
In this rap shit, you way wrong
I stay up, I stay on, shine bright, like neon
Your song's pathetic, synthetic, like Rayon
Fat beats, they play on, want dope rhymes, put me on
Word is bond
You know my steez",Gang Starr,1997,"[88, 87, 81, 81]",4

Had my hair done just right
I thought this new dress was a sure bet

As I head for the door, I turn around to be sure
Did I shave my legs for this?

A house on a hill with a pool
Well, this trailer stays wet and we're swimming in debt

Ah ah
Baby girl was draped in Chanel
Said she love 2Pac but hates some LL
Seen her at the bar with anklets and toe rings
She can take a prince, turn him into a king
I was looking at her in the limelight, pearly whites
Said her man get paper but he don't live right
All these emotions flowing inside the club
Do you really want a thug or do ya want love?
She gets the paper when it's time to get it
She keep these clowns sinkin' like Chappaquiddick
Honey smoke make you click, feel it in their throats
No joke, all these love letters they wrote
Behind every playa is a true playette
Bounce you up, outta there, push eject
Taster's choice, have you nice and moist
Or play paper games or floss the Rolls Royce

You was king of seduction, cop a suction
Now she with a cat that worked construction
You wanna starve her with the paper, abuse her mind
This a new lover, when you know it's on mine
That's on top, lap dancin' got to stop
You play out your chick cause your game is hot
I give you two, Italian iced my whole crew
Piece banging on my chest 'til I'm black and blue
You beefin', yellin' on the cell of my 6
You reachin', then you hear the cordless click
Now your club hopping, keep the Cristal poppin'
Use my chips and take the next man shoppin'
Hell no, must be out ya mind
Got you on your knees and your elbows each and every time
That's why I love you mami, you
Run your mouth, throw your legs over the bed baby
Work me out

I needed to switch up and get it in gear
It's a whole new movie, a world premiere, yeah yeah
Keep it jinglin', no more minglin'
A brand new year, me and you can bring it in
I was sick and tired of the freakin', night to morn'
Bonin' in the mirror with my Cubans on
Let bygones be bygones, no more games
Hope all the chickenheads go up in flames
Now we in the brand new mansion, with the lake in back
Got it all figured out, mami I like that

To waste a quarter mil on clothes is sick
But you're worth it playgirl, it's real in the field
Say what you want, but keep your lips sealed

Seven weeks have passed now since she left me
She shows her face to ask me how I am

Can you forgive me? I hope that you'll be happy."" I said

I looked up at the stars
To try and find an answer in my life
I chose a star for me
I chose a star for him
I chose two stars for my kids and one star for my wife
Something made me smile
Something seemed to ease the pain
Something about the universe and how it's all connected

The park is full of Sunday fathers and melted ice cream
We try to do the best within the given time
A kid should be with his mother
Everybody knows that
What can a father do but baby-sit sometimes?

""You look different somehow""
I said, ""Everybody's got to leave the darkness sometime""

Even would bitches would tear us apart
Took me a chance and I put down my guards, now you the only nigga' with my heart
And I could put that on my soul

Why can't I keep my fingers off it?
Baby, I want you, now-now

Feelin' like an animal with these cameras all in my grill

Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, now-now

We be all night, and everything all right
No complaints from my body
So fluorescent under these lights

I'm rubbin' on it, rub-rubbin'
If you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinkin', get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out
Like washrags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinkin', I'm singin' on the mic to my boy toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway
Then ride it with my surfboard, surfboard, surfboard
Grainin' on that wood
Grainin'-grainin' on that wood

Talkin' about you be reppin' that Third
I wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood
Hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight, catch a charge I might
Beat the box up, like Mike in '97, I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no I don't play
""Now eat the cake, Anna Mae!""
Said, ""Eat the cake, Anna Mae!""
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights

106,Barely Breathing,"[Verse 1]
I know what you're doing, I see it all too clear
I only taste the saline when I kiss away your tears
You really had me going, wishing on a star
But the black holes that surround you are heavier by far
I believed in your confusion, you were so completely torn
It must've been that yesterday was the day that I was born
There's not much to examine, there's nothing left to hide
You really can't be serious, you have to ask me why
I say goodbye

[Chorus]
'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay

[Verse 2]
And everyone keeps asking, what's it all about?
I used to be so certain and I can't figure out
What is this attraction, I can only feel the pain
There's nothing left to reason and only you to blame
Will it ever change?

[Chorus]
'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay
But I'm thinking it over anyway
I'm thinking it over anyway

[Bridge]
I've come to find I may never know
Your changing mind, is it friend or foe
I rise above or sink below
With every time you come and go
Please don't come and go

[Chorus]
'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay

I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold

I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you

I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

Dear love I was thinking how I should be starting this
Magnificent ways to light your life up like an arsonist
Put my heart in this
Ticklin' you funny but when we start to kiss, marvelous
How I see you in the cut chillin' with your homies gettin' fucked up
I got fantasies of you carrying me home
Hope that you stayin' alone
I'm into givin' pleasure echoin' rhythms of my manly moans
Don't be playin' me wrong, I'm too grown for games
Mental manipulation ain't the occupation for the playa you facin' I'm strong 'cause you see I don't be really quite comin' on the same
Boldly and bodily fluids with every word that 'curs
Girl you deserve some herb and company to be with
Fuck whoever you was gon' leave with
I'm who you should see shit
I found us some love like Adam and Eve shit
Who you should be with, your body I squeeze quick
Stick through the sheets and your arms
And see, so don't be alarmed
If I make you feel good all over
'Cause I was strapping the bomb
That's 'cause I'm gonna be on
Even though niggas in the hood is all soldiers
You still'll suffer the consequences defenseless
Thinkin' about becomin' my wife
If I rock you tonight you be the love of my life
'Cause I be huggin' you like I'm huggin' the mic
Plus I'm the one that's rubbin' you right
And able to stick my tongue off in your navel and lick 'til you drop
Even though I like to stick to twat
I'm realizin' there's a variation of ways I can get you hot
I'm into learnin' you so pick the spot
I'll get pleasure too but let me hush and make the lust get a check
I know you don't want me to hit it yet
But don't actin' like its a crime 'cause it hasn't been committed yet
But baby won't you let me get it what? Get it wet

Instead of all this talkin' let your tongue do the walkin' on down this clitoris
Fuckin' with a wild hundreds bitch
Ain't that some shit?
Guaranteed to get you wet, simple kiss from petite lips
It won't take a gang of gifts just to hit this
Come and take a little glimpse of the sweet hips
When that ass in the air cause an eclipse, on the freak shit

Take a sip of liquor, I'm on bone

Willin' to learn and try to be like I got some experience

And kick it like the homies, who? Me and only you
Smoke Bs up like a cigarette 'till I can only see a silhouette
And even though you won't admit it yet

122,Not Tonight,"[Verse 1]
I know a dude named Jimmy used to run up in me
Night time pissy drunk off the Henny and Rémy
I didn't mind it, when he fucked me from behind it
Felt fine, 'specially when he used to grind it
He was a trick when I sucked his dick
He used to, pass me bricks, credit cards and shit
Suck him to sleep, I took the keys to the Jeep
Tell him, ""I'll be back,"" go fuck with some other cats
Flirtin', gettin' numbers, in the summer, ho hop
Raw top in my man's drop
Then this homie Jimmy, he's screamin', ""Gimme""
Lay me on my back, bustin' nuts all in me
After ten times we fucked, I think I bust twice
He was nice, kept my neck filled with ice
Put me in Chanels, kept me out nice
Called suckin' his dick, ""rockin' the mic""
It was somethin' about this dude I couldn't stand
Somethin' that coulda made his ass a real man
Somethin' I wanted, but I never was pushy
The motherfucker never ate my pussy

[Chorus]
I don't want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right
Uh, uh, uh, uh Lil' Kim, Lil' Kim, bring it to me now

[Verse 2]
I know a dude named Ron Doo push a Q
Had a wild crew on Flatbush & Avenue U
Had a weed spot, used to pump African black
He used to, seal his bag so his workers wouldn't tap
I used to see him, in The Tunnel, with fuckers at dawn
Whisper in my ear he wanna get his fuck on
I dug him, so I fucked him, it wasn't nuttin'
He wanted me to suck him, but I didn't, I ain't frontin'
The sex was wack, a four-stroke creep
I jumped on the dick, rode his ass to sleep
He called next week, askin' why I ain't beep him
""I thought your ass was still sleepin'""
He laughed, told me he bought a new Path
Could he come over right fast and fuck my pretty ass?
""I'll pass, nigga, the dick was trash
If sex was record sales you would be double glass
The only way you seein' me is if you eatin' me
Downtown, taste my love like Horace Brown
Tryin' to impress me with your 5 G stones
I give you 10 G's, nigga, if ya leave me alone,"" screamin'

I don't want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right
I don't want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right

The moral of the story is this:
You ain't lickin' this, you ain't stickin' this
And I got witnesses, ask any nigga I been with
They ain't hit shit till they stuck they tongue in this
I ain't with that frontin' shit
I got my own Benz, I got my own ends, immediate friends
Me and my girls rock worlds, some big niggas
Fuck for car keys, and double-digit figures
Good dick I cherish, I could be blunt
I treat it like it's precious, I ain't gonna front
For limp-dick niggas, that's frontin' like they willy
Suck my pussy till they kill me, you feel me?

G don't forget to bring the house keys
Hops in the eight, five-oh now here we go
Please, please brother don't slam my car door
It costs too much money to get that shit fixed
I need all my money to pay my bills with
Don't have no time for the shucking and jiving
Peep my rhyme cause that shit's off-timing

[Verse 3: Missy Elliott]
I'm in the Marriott, the place to get got

Touch my hot spot, I scream til I can't stop, uhh
Give it to me daddy and uhh

No fan of Madonna, she just a damn slut
So sit you damn dog and bow to my shit

[Verse 5: Timbaland]
I'm up in these labels trying to handle my business
Been making more beats before Jehovah had Witness
Up jumps da boogie, boogie jumps me
Brother brother, please, turn on the TV
See a Black man dead, from a White man's powder
See a White man scared, from a Black man's power
Back to reality
Please don't freaking smile at me
This is a stick-up so give up your wallet please

[Verse 6: Missy Elliott]
I'm the best, and that's B and that's capital
I hang low like testicles, MC's wanna copy these many flows
Hoes, better back up, foe they get slapped up
Pack up and go tell Mommy that I backed up you
You you you, and your whole screw
What, whatcha whatcha whatcha gon' do uhh, what whatcha gon' do

Wanna battle me, it's gonna be some tragedy

Regarding CF# 07-004281

I know most of you who personally know me are in disbelief to hear from media reports that I am suspected of committing such horrendous murders and have taken drastic and shocking actions in the last couple of days. You are saying to yourself that this is completely out of character of the man you knew who always wore a smile wherever he was seen. I know I will be villified by the LAPD and the media. Unfortunately, this is a necessary evil that I do not enjoy but must partake and complete for substantial change to occur within the LAPD and reclaim my name. The department has not changed since the Rampart and Rodney King days. It has gotten worse. The consent decree should never have been lifted. The only thing that has evolved from the consent decree is those officers involved in the Rampart scandal and Rodney King incidents have since promoted to supervisor, commanders, and command staff, and executive positions.

The question is, what would you do to clear your name?

Name;
A word or set of words by which a person, animal, place, or thing is known, addressed, or referred to.

Name Synonyms;
reputation, title, appellation, denomination, repute.

A name is more than just a noun, verb, or adjective. It's your life, your legacy, your journey, sacrifices, and everything you've worked hard for every day of your life as and adolescent, young adult and adult. Don't let anybody tarnish it when you know you've live up to your own set of ethics and personal ethos.

In 8/07 I reported an officer (Ofcr. Teresa Evans/now a Sergeant), for kicking a suspect (excessive force) during a Use of Force while I was assigned as a patrol officer at LAPD's Harbor Division. While cuffing the suspect, (Christopher Gettler), Evans kicked the suspect twice in the chest and once in the face. The kick to the face left a visible injury on the left cheek below the eye. Unfortunately after reporting it to supervisors and investigated by PSB (internal affairs investigator Det. Villanueva/Gallegos), nothing was done. I had broken their supposed ""Blue Line"". Unfortunately, It's not JUST US, it's JUSTICE!!! In fact, 10 months later on 6/25/08, after already successfully completing probation, acquiring a basic Post Certificate, and Intermediate Post Certificate, I was relieved of duty by the LAPD while assigned to patrol at Southwest division. It is clear as day that the department retaliated toward me for reporting Evans for kicking Mr. Christopher Gettler. The department stated that I had lied and made up the report that Evans had kicked the suspect. I later went to a Board of Rights (department hearing for decision of continued employment) from 10/08 to 1/09. During this BOR hearing a video was played for the BOR panel where Christopher Gettler stated that he was indeed kicked by Officer Evans (video sent to multiple news agencies). In addition to Christopher Gettler stating he was kicked, his father Richard Gettler, also stated that his son had stated he was kicked by an officer when he was arrested after being released from custody. This was all presented for the department at the BOR hearing. They still found me guilty and terminated me. What they didn't mention was that the BOR panel made up of Capt. Phil Tingirides, Capt. Justin Eisenberg, and City Attorney Martella had a signigicant problem from the time the board was assembled. Capt. Phil Tingirides was a personal friend of Teresa Evans from when he was her supervisor at Harbor station. That is a clear conflict of interest and I made my argument for his removal early and was denied. The advocate for the LAPD BOR was Sgt. Anderson. Anderson also had a conflict of interest as she was Evans friend and former partner from Harbor division where they both worked patrol together. I made my argument for her removal when I discovered her relation to Evans and it was denied.

During the BOR, the department attempted to label me unsuccessfully as a bully. They stated that I had bullied a recruit, Abraham Schefres, in the academy when in reality and unfounded disposition from the official 1.28 formal complaint investigation found that I was the one who stood up for Abraham Schefres when other recruits sang nazi hitler youth songs about burning Jewish ghettos in WWII Germany where his father was a survivor of a concentration camp. How fucking dare you attempt to label me with such a nasty vile word. I ask that all earnest journalist investigating this story ask Ofcr. Abraham Schefres about the incident when Ofcr. Burdios began singing a nazi youth song about burning jewish ghettos.

The internal affairs investigation in the academy involving Schefres was spurned by a complaint that I had initiated toward two fellow recruit/offifcers. While on a assigned patrol footbeat in Hollywood Division, Officers Hermilio Buridios IV and Marlon Magana (both current LAPD officers) decided that they would voice their personal feelings about the black community. While traveling back to the station in a 12 passenger van I heard Magana refer to another individual as a nigger. I wasn't sure if I heard correctly as there were many conversations in the van that was compiled of at least 8 officers and he was sitting in the very rear and me in the very front. Even with the multiple conversations and ambient noise I heard Officer Magana call an indivdual a nigger again. Now that I had confirmed it, I told Magana not to use that word again. I explained that it was a well known offensive word that should not be used by anyone. He replied, ""I'll say it when I want"". Officer Burdios, a friend of his, also stated that he would say nigger when he wanted. At that point I jumped over my front passenger seat and two other officers where I placed my hands around Burdios' neck and squeezed. I stated to Burdios, ""Don't fucking say that"". At that point there was pushing and shoving and we were separated by several other officers. What I should have done, was put a Winchester Ranger SXT 9mm 147 grain bullet in his skull and Officer Magana's skull. The Situation would have been resolved effective, immediately. The sad thing about this incident was that when Detective Ty from internal affairs investigated this incident only (1) officer (unknown) in the van other than myself had statements constistent with what actually happened. The other six officers (John Carey, Gary Parker, Jacob Waks, Abraham Schefres and names I have forgotten) all stated they heard nothing and saw nothing. Shame on every one of you. Shame on Detective Ty (same ethnicity as Burdios) for creating a separate 1.28 formal complaint against me (Schefres complaint) in retaliation for initiating the complaint against Burdios and Magana. Don't retaliate against honest officers for breaking your so called blue line. I hope your son Ryan Ty, who I knew, is a better officer than you, Detective Ty.The saddest part of this ordeal was that Officer Burdios and Magana were only given 22 day suspensions and are still LAPD officers to this day. That day, the LAPD stated that it is acceptable for fellow officers to call black officers niggers to their face and you will receive a slap on the wrist. Even sadder is that during that 22 day suspension Buridios and Magana received is that the LAPPL (Los Angeles Police Protective League) paid the officers their salaries while they were suspended. When I took a two day suspension for an accidental discharge, I took my suspension and never applied for a league salary. It's called integrity.

Journalist, I want you to investigate every location I resided in growing up. Find any incidents where I was ever accused of being a bully. You won't, because it doesn't exist. It's not in my DNA. Never was. I was the only black kid in each of my elementary school classes from first grade to seventh grade; in junior high and any instances where I was disciplined for fighting was in response to fellow students provoking common childhood schoolyard fights, or calling me a nigger or other derogatory racial names. I grew up in neighborhoods where blacks make up less than 1%. My first recollection of racism was in the first grade at Norwalk Christian elementary school in Norwalk, CA. A fellow student, Jim Armstrong if I can recall, called me a nigger on the playground. My response was swift and non-lethal. I struck him fast and hard with a punch an kick. He cried and reported it to a teacher. The teacher reported it to the principal. The principal swatted Jim for using a derogatory word toward me. He then for some unknown reason swatted me for striking Jim in response to him calling me a nigger. He stated as good Christians we are to turn the other cheek as Jesus did. Problem is, I'm not a fucking Christian and that old book, made of fiction and limited non-fiction, called the bible, never once stated Jesus was called a nigger. How dare you swat me for standing up for my rights for demanding that I be treated as a equal human being. That day I made a life decision that I will not tolerate racial derogatory terms spoken to me. Unfortunately I was swatted multiple times for the same exact reason up until junior high. Terminating me for telling the truth of a caucasian officer kicking a mentally ill man is disgusting. Don't ever call me a fucking bully. I want all journalist to utilize every source you have that specializes in collections for your reports. With the discovery and evidence available you will see the truth. Unfortunately, I will not be alive to see my name cleared. That's what this is about, my name. A man is nothing without his name. Below is a list of locations where I resided from childhood to adulthood.

Cerritos, CA.
Pico Rivera, CA.
La Palma, CA.
Thousand Oaks, CA.
Cedar City, UT.
Pensacola, FL.
Enid, OK.
Yorba Linda, CA.
Las Vegas, NV.

During the BOR an officer named, Sgt. Hernandez, from Los Angeles Port Police testified on behalf of the LAPD. Hernandez stated for the BOR that he arrived at the location of the UOF shortly before I cuffed the suspect. He also stated that he assisted in cuffing the suspect and that's old the BOR he told me to fix my tie. All of those statements were LIES!!! Hernandez, you arrived at the UOF location up to 30 seconds after I had cuffed Mr. Gettler. All you did was help me lift the suspect to his feet as it was difficult for me to do by myself because of his heavy weight. You did not tell me to fix my tie as the BOR members and everyone else in the room know you lied because the photographic evidence from the UOF scene where Gettler's injuries were photographed clearly shows me wearing a class B uniform on that day. A class B uniform is a short sleeved uniform blouse. A short sleeved uniform blouse for the LAPD does not have a tie included. This is not Super Troopers uniform, you jackass. Why did you feel the need to embellish and lie about your involvement in the UOF? Are you ashamed that you could not get hired on by any other department other than port police? Do you have delusions of grandeur? What you did was perjury, exactly what Evans did when she stated she did not kick Christopher Gettler.

What they failed to mention in the BOR was Teresa Evans own use of force history during her career on the LAPD. She has admitted that she has a lengthy use of force record and has been flagged several times by risk management. She has a very well known nickname, Chupacabra, which she was very proud to flaunt around the division. She found it very funny and entertaining to draw blood from suspects and arrestees. At one point she even intentionally ripped the flesh off the arm of a woman we had arrested for battery (sprayed her neighbor with a garden water hose). Knowing the woman had thin elastic skin, she performed and Indian burn to the woman's arm after cuffing her. That woman was in her mid-70's, a mother and grandmother, and was angry at her tenants who failed to pay rent on time. Something I can completely understand and I am sure many have wanted to do toward tenants who do not pay their rent. Teresa Evans was also demoted from a senior lead officer rank/position for performance issues. During my two months of working patrol with Teresa Evans, I found her as a woman who was very angry that she had been pulled from patrol for a short time because of a domestic violence report made by Long Beach Police Department because of an incident involving her active LAPD officer boyfriend, Dominick Fuentes, and herself. Dominick Fuentes is the same officer investigated for witness tampering. She also was visibly angry on a daily basis that she was going to have to file for bankruptcy because her ex-husband, a former LAPD officer and not Dominick Fuentes, who had left the department, state, and was nowhere to be found had left her with a tax bill and debt that she was unable to pay because of a lack of financial means. Evans, you are a POS and you lied right to the BOR panel when Randy Quan asked you if you kicked Christopher Gettler. You destroyed my life and name because of your actions. Time is up. The time is now to confess to Chief Beck.

I ask that all journalist investigating this story submit request for FOIA with the LAPD to gain access to the BOR transcripts which occurred from 10/08 to 2/09. There, you will see that a video was played for the BOR members of Mr. Christopher Gettler who suffers from Schizophrenia and Dementia stating that he was kicked by a female officer. That video evidence supports my claim that Evans kicked him twice in the upper body and once in the face. I would like all journalist to also request copies of all reports that I had written while employed by LAPD. Whether in the academy, or during my 3 years as a police officer. There are DR#'s attached to each report (investigative report) that I have ever written so they all exist. A FOIA request will most likely be needed to access these at Parker center or at the Personnel/Records. Judge my writin/grammar skills for yourself. The department attempted to paint me as an officer who could not write reports. Even though Sgt. Joel Sydanmaa a training officer who trained me stated for the BOR panel that there was nothing wrong with my report writing and that I was better than all rookie/probationer officers he has ever trained. Officer David Drew stated the same but refused to testify as he did not want to ""get involved"" with the BOR's. Contact Sgt. Donald Deming ,(now a Captain at Lompoc PD), Sgt. Thaddeus Faulk, and Sgt. Ed Clark. All will state that my report writing was impeccable. I will tell you this, I always type my reports because I have messy handwriting/penmanship. I never had a single kickback/redlined report at Southwest division and Sgt. Faulk and Sgt. Clark can testify to that. I never received an UNSATISFACTORY on any day or week. The same can be said within the U.S. Naval Reserves. All commanders will state that my report writing was always clear, concise, and impeccable. Even search my AAR (after action reports),chits, Memorandum's, IIR's (Intelligence Information Reports) which were written in the Navy. All were pristine.

I had worked patrol at LAPD's Harbor Division from 2/06 until 7/06 when I was involuntarily recalled back to active duty (US Navy) for a 12 month mobilization/deployment to Centcom in support of OIF/OEF. I returned back to LAPD's Harbor division on 7/07 and immediately returned to patrol. I worked at Harbor division until 11/07 where I then transferred to Southwest Division. I worked At Southwest division until 6/25/08 when I was relieved of duty.

I have exhausted all available means at obtaining my name back. I have attempted all legal court efforts within appeals at the Superior Courts and California Appellate courts. This is my last resort. The LAPD has suppressed the truth and it has now lead to deadly consequences. The LAPD's actions have cost me my law enforcement career that began on 2/7/05 and ended on 1/2/09. They cost me my Naval career which started on 4/02 and ends on 2/13. I had a TS/SCI clearance(Top Secret Sensitive Compartmentalized Information clearance) up until shortly after my termination with LAPD. This is the highest clearance a service member can attain other than a Yankee White TS/SCI which is only granted for those working with and around the President/Vice President of the United States. I lost my position as a Commanding Officer of a Naval Security Forces reserve unit at NAS Fallon because of the LAPD. I've lost a relationship with my mother and sister because of the LAPD. I've lost a relationship with close friends because of the LAPD. In essence, I've lost everything because the LAPD took my name and new(sic) I was INNOCENT!!! Capt Phil Tingirides, Justin Eisenberg, Martella, Randy Quan, and Sgt. Anderson all new I was innocent but decided to terminate me so they could continue Ofcr. Teresa Evans career. I know about the meeting between all of you where Evans attorney, Rico, confessed that she kicked Christopher Gettler (excessive force). Your day has come.

I'm not an aspiring rapper, I'm not a gang member, I'm not a dope dealer, I don't have multiple babies momma's. I am an American by choice, I am a son, I am a brother, I am a military service member, I am a man who has lost complete faith in the system, when the system betrayed, slandered, and libeled me. I lived a good life and though not a religious man I always stuck to my own personal code of ethics, ethos and always stuck to my shoreline and true North. I didn't need the US Navy to instill Honor, Courage, and Commitment in me but I thank them for re-enforcing it. It's in my DNA.

Luckily I don't have to live everyday like most of you. Concerned if the misconduct you were apart of is going to be discovered. Looking over your shoulder, scurrying at every phone call from internal affairs or from the Captains office wondering if that is the day PSB comes after you for the suspects you struck when they were cuffed months/years ago or that $500 you pocketed from the narcotics dealer, or when the other guys on your watch beat a transient nearly to death and you never reported the UOF to the supervisor. No, I don't have that concern, I stood up for what was right but unfortunately have dealt with the reprocussions of doing the right thing and now losing my name and everything I ever stood for. You fuckers knew Evans was guilty of kicking (excessive force) Gettler and you did nothing but get rid of what you saw as the problem, the whistleblower. Gettler himself stated on video tape ( provided for the BOR and in transcripts) he was kicked and even his father stated that his son said he was kicked by Evans when he was released from custody. The video was played for the entire BOR to hear. Tingirides, Eisenberg, and Martella all heard it. You're going to see what a whistleblower can do when you take everything from him especially his NAME!!!

Look what you did to Sgt. Gavin (now lieutenant) when he exposed the truth of your lying, racism, and PSB cover-ups to frame and convict an innocent man. You can not police yourselves and the consent decree was unsuccessful. Sgt. Gavin, I met you on the range several times as a recruit and as an officer. You're a good man and I saw it in your eyes an actions.

Self Preservation is no longer important to me. I do not fear death as I died long ago on 1/2/09. I was told by my mother that sometimes bad things happen to good people. I refuse to accept that.

From 2/05 to 1/09 I saw some of the most vile things humans can inflict on others as a police officer in Los Angeles. Unfortunately, it wasn't in the streets of LA. It was in the confounds of LAPD police stations and shops (cruisers). The enemy combatants in LA are not the citizens and suspects, it's the police officers.

People who live in glass houses should not throw stones. How ironic that you utilize a fixed glass structure as your command HQ. You use as a luminous building to symbolize that you are transparent, have nothing to hide, or suppress when in essence, concealing, omitting, and obscuring is your forte.

Chief Beck, this is when you need to have that come to Jesus talk with Sgt. Teresa Evans and everyone else who was involved in the conspiracy to have me terminated for doing the right thing. you also need to speak with her attorney, Rico, and his conversation with the BOR members and her confession of guilt in kicking Mr. Gettler. I'll be waiting for a PUBLIC response at a press conference. When the truth comes out, the killing stops.

Why didn't you charge me with filing a false police report when I came forward stating that Evans kicked Mr. Christopher Gettler? You file criminal charges against every other officer who is accused and terminated for filing a false police report. You didn't because you knew I was innocent and a criminal court would find me innocent and expose your department for suppressing the truth and retaliation, that's why.

The attacks will stop when the department states the truth about my innocence, PUBLICLY!!! I will not accept any type of currency/goods in exchange for the attacks to stop, nor do I want it. I want my name back, period. There is no negotiation. I am not the state department who states they do not negotiate with terrorist, because anybody with a Secret or TS/SCI has seen IIR's on SIPR and knows that the US state department always negotiates by using CF countries or independent sovereign/neutral country to mediate and compromising.

This department has not changed from the Daryl Gates and Mark Fuhrman days. Those officers are still employed and have all promoted to Command staff and supervisory positions. I will correct this error. Are you aware that an officer (a rookie/probationer at the time) seen on the Rodney King videotape striking Mr. King multiple times with a baton on 3/3/91 is still employed by the LAPD and is now a Captain on the police department? Captain Rolando Solano is now the commanding officer of a LAPD police station (West LA division). As a commanding officer, he is now responsible for over 200 officers. Do you trust him to enforce department policy and investigate use of force investigations on arrestees by his officers? Are you aware Evans has since promoted to Sergeant after kicking Mr. Gettler in the face. Oh, you Violated a citizens civil rights? We will promote you. Same as LAPD did with the the officers from Metro involved in the May Day melee at MacArthur Park. They promoted them to Sergeant (a supervisor role).

No one is saying you can't be prejudiced or a bigot. We are all human and hold prejudices. If you state that you don't have prejudices, your lying! But, when you act on it and victimize innocent citizens and fellow innocen officers, than that is a concern.

For you officers who do the job in the name of JUSTICE, those of you who lost honest officers to this event, look at the name of those on the BOR and the investigating officers from PSB and Evans and ask them, how come you couldn't tell the truth? Why did you terminate an honest officer and cover for a dishonest officer who victimized a mentally ill citizen.

Sometimes humans feel a need to prove they are the dominant race of a species and they inadvertently take kindness for weakness from another individual. You chose wrong.

Terminating officers because they expose a culture of lying, racism (from the academy), and excessive use of force will immediately change. PSB can not police their own and that has been proven. The blue line will forever be severed and a cultural change will be implanted. You have awoken a sleeping giant.

I am here to change and make policy. The culture of LAPD versus the community and honest/good officers needs to and will change. I am here to correct and calibrate your morale compasses to true north.

Those Caucasian officers who join South Bureau divisions (77th,SW,SE, an Harbor) with the sole intent to victimize minorities who are uneducated, and unaware of criminal law, civil law, and civil rights. You prefer the South bureau because a use of force/deadly force is likely and the individual you use UOF on will likely not report it. You are a high value target.

Those Black officers in supervisory ranks and pay grades who stay in south bureau (even though you live in the valley or OC) for the sole intent of getting retribution toward subordinate caucasians officers for the pain and hostile work environment their elders inflicted on you as probationers (P-1's) and novice P-2's. You are a high value target. You perpetuated the cycle of racism in the department as well. You breed a new generation of bigoted caucasian officer when you belittle them and treat them unfairly.

Those Hispanic officers who victimize their own ethnicity because they are new immigrants to this country and are unaware of their civil rights. You call them wetbacks to their face and demean them in front of fellow officers of different ethnicities so that you will receive some sort of acceptance from your colleagues. I'm not impressed. Most likely, your parents or grandparents were immigrants at one time, but you have forgotten that. You are a high value target.

Those lesbian officers in supervising positions who go to work, day in day out, with the sole intent of attempting to prove your misandrist authority (not feminism) to degrade male officers. You are a high value target.

Those Asian officers who stand by and observe everything I previously mentioned other officers participate in on a daily basis but you say nothing, stand for nothing and protect nothing. Why? Because of your usual saying, "" I......don't like conflict"". You are a high value target as well.

Those of you who ""go along to get along"" have no backbone and destroy the foundation of courage. You are the enablers of those who are guilty of misconduct. You are just as guilty as those who break the code of ethics and oath you swore.

Citizens/non-combatants, do not render medical aid to downed officers/enemy combatants. They would not do the same for you. They will let you bleed out just so they can brag to other officers that they had a 187 caper the other day and can't wait to accrue the overtime in future court subpoenas. As they always say, ""that's the paramedics job...not mine"". Let the balance of loss of life take place. Sometimes a reset needs to occur.

It is endless the amount of times per week officers arrest an individual, label him a suspect-arrestee-defendant and then before arraignment or trial realize that he is innocent based on evidence. You know what they say when they realize an innocent man just had his life turned upside down?. ""I guess he should have stayed at home that day he was discovered walking down the street and matching the suspects description. Oh well, he appeared to be a dirtbag anyways"". Meanwhile the falsely accused is left to pick up his life, get a new, family, friends, and sense of self worth.

Don't honor these fallen officers/dirtbags. When your family members die, they just see you as extra overtime at a crime scene and at a perimeter. Why would you value their lives when they clearly don't value yours or your family members lives? I've heard many officers who state they see dead victims as ATV's, Waverunners, RV's and new clothes for their kids. Why would you shed a tear for them when they in return crack a smile for your loss because of the impending extra money they will receive in their next paycheck for sitting at your loved ones crime scene of 6 hours because of the overtime they will accrue. They take photos of your loved ones recently deceased bodies with their cellphones and play a game of who has the most graphic dead body of the night with officers from other divisions. This isn't just the 20 something year old officers, this is the 50 year old officers with significant time on the job as well who participate.

You allow an officer, Thaniya Sungruenyos, to attempt to hack into my credit union account and still remain on the job even when Det. Zolezzi shows the evidence that the IP address (provided by LAPFCU) that attempted to hack into my account and change my username and password leads directly to her residence. You even allow this visibly disgusting looking officer to stay on the job when she perjures (lies) in court (Clark County Family Court) to the judge's face and denies hacking into my personal credit union online account when I attempted to get my restraint order extended. Det. Zolezzi provided the evidence and you still do nothing.

How do you know when a police officer is lying??? When he begins his sentence with, ""based on my experience and training"".

No one grows up and wants to be a cop killer. It was against everything I've ever was. As a young police explorer I found my calling in life. But, As a young police officer I found that the violent suspects on the street are not the only people you have to watch. It is the officer who was hired on to the department (pre-2000) before polygraphs were standard for all new hires and an substantial vetting in a backround investigation.

To those children of the officers who are eradicated, your parent was not the individual you thought they were. As you get older,you will see the evidence that your parent was a tyrant who loss their ethos and instead followed the path of moral corruptness. They conspired to hide and suppress the truth of misconduct on others behalf's. Your parent will have a name and plaque on the fallen officers memorial in D.C. But, In all honesty, your parents name will be a reminder to other officers to maintain the oath they swore and to stay along the shoreline that has guided them from childhood to that of a local, state, or federal law enforcement officer.

Bratton, Beck, Hayes, Tingirides, Eisenberg, Martella, Quan, Evans, Hernandez, Villanueva/Gallegos, and Anderson. Your lack of ethics and conspiring to wrong a just individual are over.
Suppressing the truth will leave to deadly consequences for you and your family. There will be an element of surprise where you work, live, eat, and sleep. I will utilize ISR at your home, workplace, and all locations in between. I will utilize OSINT to discover your residences, spouses workplaces, and children's schools. IMINT to coordinate and plan attacks on your fixed locations. Its amazing whats on NIPR. HUMINT will be utilized to collect personal schedules of targets. I never had the opportunity to have a family of my own, I'm terminating yours. Quan, Anderson, Evans, and BOR members Look your wives/husbands and surviving children directly in the face and tell them the truth as to why your children are dead.

Never allow a LAPPL union attorney to be a retired LAPD Captain,(Quan). He doesn't work for you, your interest, or your name. He works for the department, period. His job is to protect the department from civil lawsuits being filed and their best interest which is the almighty dollar. His loyalty is to the department, not his client. Even when he knowingly knows your innocent and the BOR also knows your innocent after Christopher Gettler stated on videotape that he was kicked and Evans attorney confessed to the BOR off the record that she kicked Gettler.

The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants-TJ. This quote is not directed toward the US government which I fully support 100%. This is toward the LAPD who can not monitor itself. The consent decree should not have been lifted, ever.

I know your TTP's, (techniques, tactics, and procedures). Any threat assessments you you generate will be useless. This is simple, I know your TTP's and PPR's. I will mitigate any of your attempts at preservation. ORM is my friend. I will mitigate all risks, threats and hazards. I assure you that Incident Command Posts will be target rich environments. KMA-367 license plate frames are great target indicators and make target selection even easier.

I will conduct DA operations to destroy, exploit and seize designated targets. If unsuccessful or unable to meet objectives in these initial small scale offensive actions, I will reassess my BDA and re-attack until objectives are met. I have nothing to lose. My personal casualty means nothing. Just alike AAF's, ACM's, and AIF's, you can not prevail against an enemy combatant who has no fear of death. An enemy who embraces death is a lose, lose situation for their enemy combatants.

Hopefully you analyst have done your homework. You are aware that I have always been the top shot, highest score, an expert in rifle qualifications in every unit I've been in. I will utilize every bit of small arms training, demolition, ordnance, and survival training I've been given.

Do you know why we are unsuccessful in asymmetrical and guerrilla warfare in CENTCOM theatre of operations? I'll tell you. It's not the inefficiency of our combatant commanders, planning, readiness or training of troops. Much like the Vietnam war, ACM, AAF, foreign fighters, Jihadist, and JAM have nothing to lose. They embrace death as it is a way of life. I simply don't fear it. I am the walking exigent circumstance you created.

The Violence of action will be HIGH. I am the reason TAC alert was established. I will bring unconventional and asymmetrical warfare to those in LAPD uniform whether on or off duty. ISR is my strength and your weakness. You will now live the life of the prey. Your RD's and homes away from work will be my AO and battle space. I will utilize every tool within INT collections that I learned from NMITC in Dam Neck. You have misjudged a sleeping giant. There is no conventional threat assessment for me. JAM, New Ba'ath party, 1920 rev BGE, ACM, AAF, AQAP, AQIM and AQIZ have nothing on me. Do not deploy airships or gunships. SA-7 Manpads will be waiting. As you know I also own Barrett .50's so your APC are defunct and futile.

You better have all your officers radio/phone muster (code 1) on or off duty every hour, on the hour.
Do not attempt to shadow or conduct any type of ISR on me. I have the inventory listing of all UC vehicles at Piper Tech and the home addresses of any INT analyst at JRIC and detachment locations. My POA is always POI and always true. This will be a war of attrition and a Pyrrhic and Camdean Victory for myself. You may have the resources and manpower but you are reactive and predictable in your op plans and TTP's. I have the strength and benefits of being unpredictable, unconventional, and unforgiving. Do not waste your time with briefs and tabletops.

Whatever pre-planned responses you have established for a scenario like me, shelve it. Whatever contingency plan you have, shelve it. Whatever tertiary plan you've created, shelve it. I am a walking exigent circumstance with no OFF or reset button. JRIC, DOJ, LASD, FBI and other local LE can't assist and should not involve themselves in a matter that does not concern them. For all other agencies, do not involve yourself in this capture or recovery of me. Look at the big picture of the situation. They (LAPD) created the situation. I will harm no outside agency unless it is a deadly force/IDOL situation. With today's budgeting and fiscal mess, you guys can not afford lose several officers to IOD or KIA/EOW. Plus, other officers should not have to take on the additional duties and responsibilities of dead officers. Think about their families, outside agencies, Chiefs/Directors.

Outside agencies and individual officers on patrol. If you recognize my vehicle, and confirm it is my vehicle thru a dmv/want warrant check. It behoves you to respond to dispatch that your query was for information purposes only. If you proceed with a traffic stop or attempt to notify other officers of my location or for backup you will not live to see the medal of valor you were hoping to receive for your actions. Think before you attempt to intervene. You will not survive. Your family will receive that medal of valor posthumously. It will gather dust on the fireplace mantel for years. Then one day, it will go in a shoe box with other memories. Your mother will lose a son or daughter. Your significant other will be left alone, but they will find someone else to fill your void in the future and make them just as happy. Your children, if you have them, will call someone else mommy or daddy. Don't be selfish. Your vest is only a level II or IIIA, think about it.

No amount of IMINT, MASINT, and ELINT assist you in capturing me. I am off the grid. You better use your feet, tongue and every available DOD/ NON-DOD HUMINT agency, contractor to find me. I know your route to and from home, and your division. I know your significant others routine, your children's best friends and recess. I know Your Sancha's gym hours and routine. I assure you that the casualty rate will be high. Because of that, no one will remember your name. You will merely be a DR# and ""that guy"" who was KIA/EOW or long term IOD/light duty in the kit room. This is exactly why ""station 500"" was created. Unfortunately, orphanages will be making a comeback in the 21st century.

If you had a well regulated AWB, this would not happen. The time is now to reinstitute a ban that will save lives. Why does any sportsman need a 30 round magazine for hunting? Why does anyone need a suppressor? Why does anyone need a AR15 rifle? This is the same small arms weapons system utilized in eradicating Al Qaeda, Taliban, and every enemy combatant since the Vietnam war. Don't give me that crap that its not a select fire or full auto rifle like the DoD uses. That's bullshit because troops who carry the M-4/M-16 weapon system for combat ops outside the wire rarely utilize the select fire function when in contact with enemy combatants. The use of select fire probably isn't even 1% in combat. So in essence, the AR-15 semiautomatic rifle is the same as the M-4/M-16. These do not need to be purchased as easily as walking to your local Walmart or striking the enter key on your keyboard to ""add to cart"". All the firearms utilized in my activities are registered to me and were legally purchased at gun stores and private party transfers. All concealable weapons (pistols) were also legally register in my name at police stations or FFL's. Unfortunately, are you aware that I obtained class III weapons (suppressors) without a background check thru NICS or DROS completely LEGALLY several times? I was able to use a trust account that I created on quicken will maker and a $10 notary charge at a mailbox etc. to obtain them legally. Granted, I am not a felon, nor have a DV misdemeanor conviction or active TRO against me on a NCIC file. I can buy any firearm I want, but should I be able to purchase these class III weapons (SBR's, and suppressors) without a background check and just a $10 notary signature on a quicken will maker program? The answer is NO. I'm not even a resident of the state I purchased them in. Lock n Load just wanted money so they allow you to purchase class III weapons with just a notarized trust, military ID. Shame on you, Lock n Load. NFA and ATF need new laws and policies that do not allow loopholes such as this. In the end, I hope that you will realize that the small arms I utilize should not be accessed with the ease that I obtained them. Who in there right mind needs a fucking silencer!!! who needs a freaking SBR AR15? No one. No more Virginia Tech, Columbine HS, Wisconsin temple, Aurora theatre, Portland malls, Tucson rally, Newtown Sandy Hook. Whether by executive order or thru a bi-partisan congress an assault weapons ban needs to be re-instituted. Period!!!

Mia Farrow said it best. ""Gun control is no longer debatable, it's not a conversation, its a moral mandate.""

Sen. Feinstein, you are doing the right thing in leading the re-institution of a national AWB. Never again should any public official state that their prayers and thoughts are with the family. That has become cliche' and meaningless. Its time for action. Let this be your legacy that you bestow to America. Do not be swayed by obstacles, antagaonist, and naysayers. Remember the innocent children at Austin, Kent, Stockton, Fullerton, San Diego, Iowa City, Jonesboro, Columbine, Nickel Mines, Blacksburg, Springfield, Red Lake, Chardon, Aurora, and Newtown. Make sure this never happens again!!!

In my cache you will find several small arms. In the cache, Bushmaster firearms, Remington precision rifles, and AAC Suppressors (silencers). All of these small arms are manufactured by Cerberus/Freedom Group. The same company responsible for the Portland mall shooting, Webster , NY, and Sandy Hook massacre.

You disrespect the office of the POTUS/Presidency and Commander in Chief. You call him Kenyan, mongroid, halfrican, muslim, and FBHO when in essence you are to address him as simply, President. The same as you did to President George W. Bush and all those in the highest ranking position of our land before him. Just as I always have. You question his birth certificate, his educational and professional accomplishments, and his judeo-christian beliefs. You make disparaging remarks about his dead parents. You never questioned the fact that his former opponent, the honorable Senator John McCain, was not born in the CONUS or that Bush had a C average in his undergrad. Electoral Candidates children (Romney) state they want to punch the president in the face during debates with no formal repercussions. No one even questioned the fact that the son just made a criminal threat toward the President. You call his wife a Wookie. Off the record, I love your new bangs, Mrs. Obama. A woman whose professional and educational accomplishments are second to none when compared to recent First wives. You call his supporters, whether black, brown, yellow, or white, leeches, FSA, welfare recipients, and ni$&er lovers. You say this openly without any discretion. Before you start with your argument that you believe I would vote for Obama because he has the same skin color as me, fuck you. I didn't vote in this last election as my choice of candidate, John Huntsman, didn't win the primary candidacy for his party. Mr. President, I haven't agreed with all of your decisions but of course I haven't agreed with all of your predecessors decisions. I think you've done a hell of a job with what you have been dealt and how you have managed it. I shed a tear the night you were initially elected President in 2008. I never thought that day would occur. A black man elected president in the U.S. in my lifetime. I cracked a smiled when you were re-elected in 2012 because I really didn't think you were going to pull that one off. Romney, stop being a sore loser. You could've exited graciously and still contributed significantly to public service, not now. Mr. President, get back to work. Many want to see you fail as they have stated so many times previously. Unfortunately, if you fail, the U.S. fails but your opponents do not concern themselves about the big picture. Do not forget your commitment to transparency in your administration. Sometimes I believe your administration forgets that. America, you will realize today and tomorrow that this world is made up of all human beings who have the same general needs and wants in life for themselves, their kin, community, and state. That is the freedom to LIVE and LOVE. They may eat different foods, enjoy different music, have different dialects, or speak a second language, but in essence are no different from you and I. This is America. We are not a perfect sovereign country as we have our own flaws but we are the closest that will ever exist.

Unfortunately, this is not the first time an authoritative figure has lied on me.

Mr. Freid, assistant principal, Cypress HS. Remember when you lied to my mother and the police officer in your office about stating that you never stated to me in a private conversation that you know the theft suspect (Miranda) stole my watch. Let me refresh your memory. A physical education teachers assistant, a student, stole the list of combination codes to peoples lockers, from the P.E. teacher. That student then opened many of those lockers and stole students personal property. My watch was taken in that multi theft an I reported it to you. A week later you discovered that the theft suspect was Paul Miranda, a student. You stated to me in private that you know for a fact he stole my property. When I attempted to retrieve my property from the suspect. Campus security was called and you lied and stated that you never stated to me that you ""know he stole my watch"". You sat there and lied to their faces right in front of me. You said it with such a deliberate, stern face. I never forgot that and was not surprised when 13 years later I was lied on again in the BOR by Teresa Evans. maybe you can confess to your family at the very least in the private of your own home. After that, contact my mother and apologize for lying to her in 1996.

If possible, I want my brain preserved for science/research to study the effects of severe depression on an individual's brain. Since 6/26/08 when I was relieved of duty and 1/2/09 when I was terminated I have been afflicted with severe depression. I've had two CT scans during my lifetime that are in my medical record at Kaiser Permanente. Both are from concussions resulting from playing football. The first one was in high school, 10/96. The second was in college and occurred in 10/99. Both were conducted at Kaiser Permanente hospitals in LA/Orange county. These two CT scans should give a good baseline for my brain activity before severe depression began in late 2008.

Sure, many of you ""law enforcement experts and specialist"" will state, ""in all my years this is the worst........"", Stop!!! That's not important. Ask yourselves what would cause somebody to take these drastic measures like I did. That's what is important.

To my friends listed below, I wish we could have grown old together and spent more time together. When you reminisce of our friendship and experiences, think of that and that only. Do not dwell on my recent actions the last few days. This was a necessary evil that had to be executed in order for me to obtain my NAME back. The only thing that changes policy and garners attention is death.

Luis Sanchez, greatest friend, Marine officer, aviator, and an even better father and husband. I Couldn't have had a better big brother than you. Your spoken wisdom was always retained by me, you old salty Mustang. You sternly told me that no matter what I accomplish I will always be a ni#%er in many individuals eyes. At the time, I did not comprehend your words. I do now. I never forgot the quote you state below. I love you bro.

I never saw a wild thing feel sorry for itself. A small bird will drop frozen dead from a bough without ever feeling sorry for itself. -D.H. Lawrence

Jason Valadao, greatest friend, Naval officer, aviator, Great Father, husband, doctor, and even better human being. I always strived to live my life parallel to your similar values and personal disciplines. Danika is lucky to have found a man like yourself, and you are fortunate to have married an irrefutable imperfect woman. Always focus on your IMMEDIATE family as they are the ones who have loved you unconditionally and always been their to support you in difficult times. I always lived my life as WWJD (what would Jason do). Danika, take care of this guy. Jason, I'm sorry I missed your wedding and you had to find another best man. I'm sorry my predicament with the department stopped me from watching you and Danika get married and arguing with you about issues that were insignificant when I was really angry at the LAPD for what they did to me. I'm deeply sorry and I love you guys.

James Usera, great friend, attorney, father, husband, and the most cynical/blatant/politically incorrect friend a man can have. Best quality about you in college and now is that you never sugar coated the truth. I will miss our political discussions that always turned argumentative. Thanks for introducing me to outdoor sports like fishing, hunting, mudding, and also respect for the land and resources. Us city boys don't get out much like you Alaskans. You even introduced me to PBR. A beer, that when you're a poor college student is completely acceptable to get buzzed off of. I'm sorry I'll never get to go on that moose and bear hunt with you. I love you bro.

Kinta Smith, greatest friend, accountant, entrepreneur, and even better Human being. You are probably the most well balanced person I've ever met and the most driven for success. In college, and after graduation, I was inspired by your personal drive. Never settle. When you make your first million, promise me you won't forget to enjoy it a bit. I know your first reaction will be to invest it somewhere else. Spend a little, just a little. I love you bro.

Jason Young, great friend, entrepeneur, husband and father. You showed me the importance of fatherhood and friendship. Love you bro.

Suzie Clark Cunningham, Kassandra Harrell, Melinda Yates, Cal Jackson, Ryan Smith, The Rebelledos, The Banks, Ben Bines, J. Work, Bill O'neill, Jeremy Fletcher, and Rob Harriston.

You guys were all important and very special to me. Don't be angry with me. I missed some of your weddings and unfortunately, some of your funerals. This was a necessary evil.

Some say it is my fault that I was terminated. Yes, DDX, I remember you stating this to me in an angry fit. You said that I should have kept my mouth shut about another officer's misconduct. Maybe you were right. But I'm not built like others, it's not in my DNA and my history has always shown that. When you view the video of the suspect stating he was kicked by Evans, maybe you will see that I was a decent person after all. I told the truth. It still hurt that you abandoned me in my time of need. I hope you're happy, that's all I ever wanted for you.

Sgt. Leonard Perez, you meant well but you should have known with your time on the job that the department would attempt to protect someone like Evans because of her time on the job, personal friendships, and ethicity. I'm not angry with you, but you should have known as an IA investigator.

Sgt Maggie Faust LPPD, Ofcr John Thomas LPPD (ret), and Chief Eric Nunez LPPD, your guidance and mentoring as a young police explorer was second to none and invaluable as a young man, police officer, and naval officer. Sgt Faust, you forewarned me long ago about joining LAPD as they were ""different"" and operated differently from other modern law enforcement agencies. I now know it was your humbleness and respect for all who wear the badge and protect their communities that you didn't just express what you wanted to say, that they lack values and basic ethics as law enforcement officers. Chief Nunez, your fucking awesome. Thanks for the long talks over the years when I was an explorer, college student, Naval officer, and Police officer. Your are a great leader and carry your heart on your sleeve. Your son will be a great Air Force officer with the upringing you provided. John, what can I say? Your just an awesome person and my first exposure to what law enforcement was really about was on our ride alongs. Your realistic approach and empathetic approach to treating all people as humans first is something I carried with me daily. Thank you, every one of you.

Dr. Funahashi, thank you for the superb surgery you performed on my knee on 7/98 in Irvine, CA. I never had the opportunity to thank you for allowing me to live a life free of knee joint pain. Thank you.

CM1 Bissett (Ret.), I learned more from you about leadership than most of my own commanders. You lived by a strict ethos of get it done, and get it done right. I wanted to attend your retirement, I really did. But because of my predicament I was unable to. Hope you and Ritchie are still together. I've always held you in high regard.

Sgt Maj. Kenneth ""Rock"" Rocquemore USMC, Thank you for the intense instruction and mentorship and time spent forging me into a never quit officer. You were challenging as a DI. You made sure the vicious and intense personality I possess was discovered. On a lighter note....Don't feel humbled you never broke me. I made it a personal goal to never give up years before. The Corp is lucky to have you at the front. Your leadership is essential and needed for all marines, especially staff NCO's and mentorship and advisement to company grade officers. You are the epitome of a US marine and never forget that.

I thank my friends for the awesome shared experiences. I thank the unnamed women I dated over my lifetime for the great and sometimes not so great sex.

It's kind of sad I won't be around to view and enjoy The Hangover III. What an awesome trilogy. Todd Phillips, don't make anymore Hangovers after the third, takes away the originality of its foundation. World War Z looks good and The Walking Dead season 3 (second half) looked intriguing. Damn, gonna miss shark week.

Mr. Vice President, do your due diligence when formulating a concise and permanent national AWB plan. Future generations of Americans depend on your plan and advisement to the president. I've always been a fan of yours and consider you one of the few genuine and charismatic politicians. Damn, sounds like an oxymoron calling you an honest politician. It's the truth.

Hillary Clinton. You'll make one hell of a president in 2016. Much like your husband, Bill, you will be one of the greatest. Look at Castro in San Antonio as a running mate or possible secretary of state. He's (good people) and I have faith and confidence in him. Look after Bill. He was always my favorite President. Chelsea grew up to be one hell of an attractive woman. No disrespect to her husband.

Gov. Chris Christie. What can I say? You're the only person I would like to see in the White House in 2016 other than Hillary. You're America's no shit taking uncle. Do one thing for your wife, kids, and supporters. Start walking at night and eat a little less, not a lot less, just a little. We want to see you around for a long time. Your leadership is greatly needed.

Wayne LaPierre, President of the NRA, you're a vile and inhumane piece of shit. You never even showed 30 seconds of empathy for the children, teachers, and families of Sandy Hook. You deflected any type of blame/responsibility and directed it toward the influence of movies and the media. You are a failure of a human being. May all of your immediate and distant family die horrific deaths in front of you.

Chris Matthews, Joe Scarborough, Pat Harvey, Brian Williams, Soledad Obrien, Wolf Blitzer, Meredith Viera, Tavis Smiley, and Anderson Cooper, keep up the great work and follow Cronkite's lead. I hold many of you in the same regard as Tom Brokaw and the late Peter Jennings. Cooper, stop nagging and berating your guest, they're your (guest). Mr. Scarborough, we met at McGuire's pub in P-cola in 2002 when I was stationed there. It was an honor conversing with you about politics, family, and life.

Willie Geist, you're a talented and charismatic journalist. Stop with all the talk show shenanigans and get back to your core of reporting. Your future is brighter than most.

Revoke the citizenship of Fareed Zakaria and deport him. I've never heard a positive word about America or its interest from his mouth, ever. On the same day, give Piers Morgan an indefinite resident alien and Visa card. Mr. Morgan, the problem that many American gun owners have with you and your continuous discussion of gun control is that you are not an American citizen and have an accent that is distinct and clarifies that you are a foreigner. I want you to know that I agree with you 100% on enacting stricter firearm laws but you must understand that your critics will always have in the back of their mind that you are native to a country that we won our sovereignty from while using firearms as a last resort in defense and you come from a country that has no legal private ownership of firearms. That is disheartening to American gun owners and rightfully so.

The honorable President George H.W. Bush, they never give you enough credit for your successful Presidency. You were always one of my favorite Presidents (2nd favorite). I hope your health improves greatly. You are the epitome of an American and service to country.

General Petraeus, you made a mistake that the majority of men make once, twice, or unfortunately many times in a lifetime. You are human. You thought with your penis. It's okay.I personally believe you should have never resigned and told your critics to shove it. You only answer to two people regarding the affair, your wife and children, period. I hope you return to government service to your country as it is visibly in your DNA.

General Colin Powell, your book ""My American Journey"" solidified my decision to join the military after college. I had always intended to serve, but your book and journey motivated me. You are an inspiration to all Americans and influenced me greatly.

To all SEA's (senior enlisted advisers), you are just as important if not a greater viability to large and small commands. It's time you take a more active role in leading your enlisted and advising officers. These are not your twilight years or time to relax. You can either strengthen the tip of the spear, or make it brittle. You decide.

Pat Harvey, I've always thought you carried yourself professionally and personally the way a strong black woman should. Your articulation and speech is second to none. You are the epitome of a journalist/anchor. You are America.

Ellen Degeneres, continue your excellent contribution to entertaining America and bringing the human factor to entertainment. You changed the perception of your gay community and how we as Americans view the LGBT community. I congratulate you on your success and opening my eyes as a young adult, and my generation to the fact that you are know different from us other than who you choose to love. Oh, and you Prop 8 supporters, why the fuck do you care who your neighbor marries. Hypocritical pieces of shit.

Westboro Baptist Church, may you all burn slowly in a fire, not from smoke inhalation, but from the flames and only the flames.

Tebow, I really wanted to see you take charge of an offense again and the game. You are not a good QB by todays standards, but you are a great football player who knows how to lead a team and WIN. You will be ""Tebowing"" when you reach your next team. I have faith in you. Get out of that circus they call the Jets and away from the reality TV star, Rex Ryan, and Mark Rapist Sanchez.

Christopher Walz, you impressed me in Inglorious Basterds. After viewing Django Unchained, I was sold. I have come to the conclusion that you are well on your way to becoming one of the greats if not already and show glimpses of Daniel Day Lewis and Morgan Freeman-esque type qualities of greatness. Trust me when I say that you will be one of the greatest ever.

Jennifer Beals, Serena Williams, Grae Drake, Lisa Nicole-Carson, Diana Taurasi, N'bushe Wright, Brenda Villa, Kate Winslet, Ashley Graham, Erika Christensen, Gabrielle Union, Isabella Soprano, Zain Verjee, Tamron Hall, Gina Carano, America Ferrara, Giana Michaels, Nene, Natalie Portman, Queen Latifah, Michelle Rodriguez, Anjelah Johnson, Kelly Clarkson, Nora Jones, Laura Prepon, Margaret Cho, and Rutina Wesley, you are THE MOST beautiful women on this planet, period. Never settle, professionally or personally.

Dave Brubeck's ""Take Five"" is the greatest piece of music ever, period. Hanz Zimmer, William Bell, Eric Clapton, BB King, Bob Marley, Sam Cooke, Metallica, Rob Zombie, Nora Jones, Marvin Gaye, Jay-Z, and the King (Louis Armstrong) are musical prodigies.

Jeffrey Toobin and David Gergen, you are political geniuses and modern scholars. Hopefully Toobin is nominated for the Supreme Court and implements some damn common sense and reasoning instead of partisan bickering. But in true Toobin fashion, we all know he would not accept the nomination.
,
John and Ken from KFI, never mute your facts and personal opinions. You are one of the few media personalities who speak the truth, even when the truth is not popular. I will miss listening to your discussions.

Bill Handel, your effin awesome. For years I enjoyed your show.

Anthony Bourdain, you're a modern renaissance man who epitomizes the saying ""too cool for school"".

Larry David, Kevin Hart, the late Patrice Oneal, Lisa Lampanelli, Chris Rock, Jerry Seinfeld, Louis CK, Dave Chapelle, Jon Stewart, Wanda Sykes, Dennis Miller, and Jeff Ross are pure geniuses. I'm a big fan of all of your work. As a child my mom caught me watching Def Jam comedy at midnight when I should have been asleep. Instead of scolding me, the next night she let me stay up late and watch George Carlin, Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor comedy specials with her for hours. My sides were sore for days.

Larry David, I agree. 72-82 degrees is way to hot in a residence. 68 , degrees is perfect.

Cyclist, I have no problem sharing the road with you. But, at least go the fucking speed limit posted or get off the road!!! That is a feasible request. Livestrong you fraudulent assholes.

Cardinal Mahoney, you are in essence a predator yourself as you enabled your subordinates to molest multiple children in the church over many decades. May you die a long and slow painful death.

If you continuously followed me while I was walking at dusk/night I would confront you as well. Too bad Trayvon didn't smash your skull completely open, Zim. While Trayvon's body erodes to bones 6 feet under, Zimmerman has put on no less than 40 pounds while out on bail. Zimmerman was arrested for battery on a Peace officer and avoided jail/prison because he completed a diversion program. Thats a history of being an asshole. Zimmerman couldn't get hired by a LE agency because of poor credit/and a history of violence/restraining orders with women. So what does he do? Designate himself, neighborhood watch captain and make complaints to his city council about the horrible work ethic and laziness of the officers patrolling his neighborhood. Good one Zim. How classy that your father attempts to use his veterans status ""disabled veteran"" during your bail hearing but doesn't state what his disability percentage is. Prior service personnel know it can be 5% disability to 100%. You and your attorneys always avoid mentioning your fathers occupation as a magistrate/judge because I'm sure he's utilized his position to get you out of way more jams then the public has discovered and that your family is not indigent. Oh, tell your wife to stop perjuring herself in court.

KCCO

Anonymous, you are hated, vilified, and considered an enemy to the state. I personally view you as a culture and a necessity that brings truth to a cloaked world. Forge ahead!

Charlie Sheen, you're effin awesome.

My opinion on women in combat MOS', Designators, Rates, and AFSC's. I wish all of you who attempt to pursue combat occupational roles the greatest success in completing, graduating, and qualifying in their respective schools/courses. Many want to see you fail. Remember, everyone of you is a pioneer. There was a time when they didn't allow blacks to fight the good fight. This is your civil rights. Don't quit!!!

It's time to allow gay service member's spouses to utilize the same benefits that all heterosexual dependents are eligible for. Medical, Dental, Tricare, Deers, SGLI, BX, Commissary, Milstar, MWR, etc. Flag officers, lets be honest. You can't really give a valid argument to as why gays shouldn't be eligible as every month a new state enacts laws that allow same sex marriage.

LGBT community and supporters, the same way you have the right to voice your opinion on acceptance of gay marriage, Chick Fil-A has a right to voice their beliefs as well. That's what makes America so great. Freedom of expression. Don't be assholes and boycott/degrade their business and customers who patronize the locations. They make some damn good chicken! Vandalizing (graffiti) their locations does not help any cause.

Mr. Bill Cosby, you are a reasonable and talented man who has spoken the truth of the cultural anomalies within the black communities that need to change now. The black communities' resentment toward you is because they don't like hearing the truth or having their clear and evident dirty laundry aired to the nation. The problem is, the country is not blind nor dumb. They believe we are animals. Do not mute your unvarnished truthful speech or moral compass. Blacks must strive for more in life than bling, hoes, and cars. The current culture is an epidemic that leaves them with no discernible future. They're suffocating and don't even know it. MLK Jr. Would be mortified at what he worked so hard for in our acceptance as equal beings and how unfortunately we stopped progressing and began digressing. Chicago's youth violence is a prime example of how our black communities values have declined. We can not address this nation's intolerant issues until we address our own communities morality issues first. Accountability. We need to hold out.",Christopher Dorner,1997,"[91, 92, 83, 80, 68, 64, 62, 58, 64, 53, 54, 56, 53, 53, 55]",15
132,The Joint,"[Verse 1]
The only joint my mama burned, was on a rural route
She parked in old man Taylor's woods
So she wouldn't be found out
Turned off her dome light, snuck off by herself
Crouched down beneath that window
Fired it up and gave it hell

[Chorus]
That hang out my daddy used to hang around
We watched it all go up in smoke until it all came down
Just like that the tabs 'n stools and tables got turned
To the only joint my mama ever burned... burned

[Verse 2]
Just like someone flipped a switch, dad started comin' home
No more eatin' late, cause supper's with that tavern gone
I had my suspicions, till one night when we said grace
Dad said forgive us our tran'gression
A smile lit up mama's face

[Chorus]
Like that hangout my daddy used to hang around
We watched it all go up in smoke until it all came down
Just like at the [?] 'n stools and tables got turned
To the only joint my mama ever burned
Burned... burned... burned

[reverb under horn]
Burned... burned... burned... burned

[Bridge]
Of all the small town Barney Fife's
And bloodhounds in this town
I'm only the one who ever found out about

[Chorus]
That hangout my daddy used to hang around
We watched it all go up in smoke until it all came down
Just like at the [?] 'n stools and tables got turned
To the only joint my mama ever burned
Burned... burned... burned... burned

133,Me And My Crazy World,"[Verse 1]
Now I'm in love with these two chicks
I don't know which one to pick
My feelings for them both are getting thick
Now am I wrong cause I don't want to lose none of them
Am I confused cause I don't want to chose one of them
It's no doubt I think about my honeys everyday
It's no question I show my honeys love in every way
Possible I once took my shorty to the hospital
She cut that hand on glass plus I love that ass
Short and sexy lips always wet see
I go downtown cause it's fresh plus she lets me
Rub it the right way like Johnny Gill would say
I'm glad you feel that way sometimes we just chill and lay
In the sack I rub her back when we're resting
It was love at first sight my confession
She know who she is can't say her name
Cause if I do I won't be true to my game
Word up

[Hook]
I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix I'm in love with two women
That's word to Moms
I got two honeys on my arms and I don't want to let none of them go
Yo I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix I'm in love with two women
That's word to Moms
I got two honeys on my arms and I don't want to let none of them go

[Verse 2]
Now, my next one she lives out of state
I mean the sex and conversation situation is great
Everytime I hit town we make a date
And when it's time to chill my shorty can't wait
Now I can still remember when we first met eachother
Exchanged numbers promised we won't forget eachother
Goes to work and school
That's cool
No doubt that's why a nigga went that route
No form foot locker
Shorty lookin proper
She's out to get me can't stop her
Know I had a lover
Yo still went for her
Even copped a bed and kicks on the strength of her
Yo chatted talkin bout see you later
From that moment on I knew that I had to date her
Couldn't conversate long
Shorty had to go back to work
Something inside said that will work

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I thought I couldn't live with chicks cause they be too demanding
Especially the ones that's never understanding, like
Who was that? Where you goin? Who you out with?
Them same niggas I make moves and I shout with
Don't let these niggas in the street gash your head up
Like they can do better than me
Plus I'm fed up
I had to tell my main chick that one time
Thinking to me short
She thought that I'm
Some clown nigga she can scream on and talk to
I had to run her down the line this ain't no walk through
Now who the fuck you think you talking to chick
Your complaining's making me sick
Understand man I tried to do my thing
Yo understand I played the puppet on the string
Like I say everyday be careful my friend
Good things always come to an end
So yo

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
See the moral of this is that I really do care
But I'm not afraid to go there
Very unselfish and yes I do share
You could have your bitch but you gets nowhere
Word, she began by saying try after try
It's a done deal
Now I'm singing bye bye
All I tried to do was keep you satisfied
Never dealing with no others I try
Too many threats kid, gotta let her go
Always in your corner
Got to let her know
As I grab my coat and painfully walked out
Hands about to give, we talked out
I'm feeling pain as it came to an end
I said to shorty I will always be your friend
Now if you ever need me I will be right there
I ain't going nowhere, for real

134,Bitch,"[Produced by Sounwave]

[Chorus]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

[Verse 1]
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin' with you?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge

[Refrain]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this

[Chorus]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

[Verse 2]
I'm tryin' to keep it alive
And not compromise the feeling we love
You're tryin' to keep it deprived
And only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror
I know what you scared of
The feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name
I'll let the people know this is somethin' you can blame
On yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I'ma break out and then hide every lock

[Refrain]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this

[Chorus]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

[Outro]
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
You ain't heard the coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings
Now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music
I say bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

I wonder if this influence can be of greater sauce
Healing wounds, fighting wars nun the less though
This is a sequel to his never dying
Forever surviving
Legendary legacy
The one and only
The mighty
Kings never die, honestly!?
Where the fucks you been waiting for me to catch up to the actual applaudable special?
Where do the dutch keep there fires warm enough that Michelle marches on by and the pope stays home and does not smoke the dope?
Where is this guy iv been told so much about by his very own
His children
Where is this world coming to though honestly i`m exhausted
Need you to respect the last verse i would write about for a while, or i be on redial
I repeat, i`m standing so to speak
Turn the cheek bleaker than weak
Outspoken so i`m telling you this so you don`t fall on ur face or nothing
Need to be the bigger picture perfect now for the future does not seem suicidal if we did that in a motion of Chinese soup, i`m goofing around i`m disney stuck in my head, like Daffy duck
Despicable
Maria ooh
More polo orientated if you will
Still don`t feel me?
This game you made me!
Dude switch me chairs
007 was never there
Luther why does that remind me of her to like every day i could tell you a man duuuuu would suit her better
I miss you man, yeah thats a fact
We have never met and i am still human
Even took off my hat
Now even though half the people reading this or maybe one day thinking while hearing me in the back of their minds, only one needs to suggest the possibility exists damn up right
Straight out the back door same way they came in
I`m the one that said i meant it when i loved you in the beginning.the things he had to go through
If i knew, would i have believed you?
Would i have been enough for you even if i said i could?
How would i have ever gotten through?
That we would be fighting a war between each other similar to you and the illuminati as it is all some made up illness, some sick similarities that gets you just as far to open the mind and lose it every time we mad
We will all surely go mad
Thats sad, but we would have argued i must predict you would have said, or did
Whats the difference if i were twice my age and saved by myself instead
Your defeat playing the role of an alter ego than maybe i would be to smart for this
Your world and mine would fall apart as i handle the fact or come to terms with that you would just take me down with you
And let me see
That i would do the same just in case this situation needs a person to blame and there is no such thing as the game
Just some trip that you took
On a psychedelic you could be the fool i was taking this one
As i make up these lines do you have any idea where this idea comes from?
Heres a clue
I could be a Deejay
I could be the C.I.A
I could rip you to peaces i hope you pray
I stay in this space of my brain, twisted out of its realm of good vs evil as i am anything but illuminati and knowing there are people like you with a simple timbre machine and a tv and a wave to hang a tenner on as you take your shoes off remind me why you need to have a message in a backwards motion in a song that you could just sound out on a sequel of some
So u did not survive, you had a bad trip, yeah ppl died
You scared by authority and by god the fact that when u stand you stand upright
Deserves a medal but u are not out of the darkness yet
Seems like this trip just got a little more complicated
Here is a Stan being the eminem in that same song i could giggle but that would be so brain games training
I`m more real than that less scared, now closer though yeah you got me good
I now fear you less and get you more
Slim shady does not spell it out for you
The people that believe in the trip and the illuminati do
Or watch the bullets penetrate my skull
And if i survive, let that be karma that took my side and believe me when i tell you who i am

Two Ferraris in my driveway black and navy pack the black .380
That's for safety, Neck look like I sold crack in the 80's
That's a fact I keep the mac on me daily

[Outro: Conway]
Yeah, Machine bitch, You know what's up now

146,Hole In My Soul,"[Verse 1: Clay]
I don't believe there's a god that would let this shit happen to me
Cut to the bone die alone in the street
Call your phone let you know everything
It's karma you see?
Drama you see
I've been the martyr and I've been the king
I been broke and I been stacked
Don't know if I'm moving forward or back
But I'll be damned if I stay where I'm at
Riding round buzzing myself on production, getting so tired of this bitches bluffing
Don't tell me something I already know
Bro with the cold soul and I don't owe you nothing
The 40. been calling no dough in my wallet
I've just been stalling but soon I'll be falling
Don't give a damn no I won't take a stance
I deserve nothing I don't.. (stand a chance)

[Verse 2: Crøw]
I was created to be cremated never be able to say that I made it
The only happiness I feel is sedation
Fuck the population I'll fade to grey and forget
All of your faces, I am that no one that's going nowhere
Constantly saying that life isn't fair
Sinking and sinking into my depression my only solution is this Smith and Wesson
I will never find love I will never find peace
Lucifer's fucking me won't let me go to sleep trying to take over me and I (Don't stand a chance)

[Verse 3: Clay]
Cause I'm that motherfucker with a hole in my soul, sell me that fake happiness on the low I been through it before
But I'm still hanging, Vicodin swangin, I'm losing my hope
End of my rope, dangling to strangle this world is so cold
Hand on the handle to drown out my woes
Taking that gamble they laid out my cards and I just want to fold
Back on my dumb shit, till I run shit, stay out my face if you see me in Public just want to go home
Girl I swear if you don't leave me alone I'm just trying to zone
Aye I'm a dead man talking
Don't fit the market, now I'm right back where I started
Fuck the world and its demands, out of my hands, no I just don't (Stand A Chance')",Lil Xtra,1997,"[87, 76, 82, 84, 77, 71, 67, 59, 54, 51, 58]",11

I've been a wretch from about three or two
Christened on the telly, it was on Channel 2
My dad was in the riots so they came to see his yute
Growing up I was a kid that everybody knew
Moany, it's like I'm never in the mood
A true Pisces, my emotions in my tunes
It's an understatement to say it's over being due
I took a few shots but now I'm soldiering it through
And now I'm looking at my boys turn men
Thinking lord god we coulda been like them
Cause we ain't the type to fear our opponents
The road door closed and my career path opened
It's like I'm drinking more than I'm thinking
Celebrating as I'm crossing off my wish list
I'm sleeping with both eyes open
I'm living my dream man, I don't wanna miss this

[Hook: Angel]
I'm not the man you thought I should be
That's just the way we drop them jeans where I stay
I'm not the man you thought I should be
Just take a second, get to know me

[Verse 2: Wretch 32]
It takes a second just to look me in my eyes
It takes an hour just to listen to my life
It took me years just to push me to this height
But it would take a lifetime to try and duplicate my vibe
I'm me, smooth with my scratches and scars I'm free too
Made a stamp on the charts
Now I'm sending a letter, I hope you receive it
Hand on my heart I'mma flow while it's beating
To put it in words, it could have been worse
From the underground so I could have been dirt
Took a right turn at a wrong place
Cause sometimes shortcuts are the long way
Gotta have strong faith
Now I'm pleading with my baby mamma
She tried to tell me that I'd turned into a lady lover
I got my eyes on the prize and I'm bringing home the bread
Let's make a toast, you can save the butter

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chipmunk]
Hey yo Wretch
Let me get this from here, yeah
Last month a fourteen year old in my hood got stabbed and died
I used to cruise on my bike down that same side road that he lost his life
I fill a cup with tears, lick it back like a shot just to swallow my pride
Niggas will eat from your bowl and lick you down like a pin called at a hunger strike
You don't know what it's like
Getting cheese amongst rats fam
From a town where Robin could rob Batman
Taxman underneath the taxman thinking he could tax man
I'd rather die, it's not that fam
And everything ain't what it seems on these shelves
We're parting red seas and A&Ring ourselves
And you can still get a deal and get shelved
Getting signed won't necessarily help
All this fire in my tank
I've come too far to get shanked
I'm walking on water that others sank
And now I'm laughing all the way to the bank
Power of the rhymes and lord on my side
Test me, I can make a preacher man rise
From a council estate but yeah we made it
The best things all come from the worse places

Ayo!
You off SMACK nigga, it's my house
You won't survive in this place
Shakin' my head emoji
Roc gets somethin' blew (blue) through his shirt, and a black five in his face
Nigga, two Decembers ago my nigga, I was just locked up
This past December now? I got shot up
And it's dope I made it but I don't cook crack my nigga
So this whippin' can only resultin' in me fuckin' Roc(k) up
Y'all watch this goofy ass nigga come up here playin'
About a nigga that just survived some shots
Well I'm no joke and I don't smoke, how can I die from Roc(k)?
You just had to battle for ya life, runnin' after Hollow tryin' to get a body
I just really had to battle for my life
I was runnin' down the street rocked with hollows in my body
There's a difference nigga
Nigga in this ring you my idol
But tonight my nigga, I'm son rival
It's Bad Newz written all over this hammer, that's the Gun Title
If ya other half feel some type of way, tell him he can get the fade
I'm Free Willy, I jump over Roc(k) and hit the wave
No lackin' in this battle, I stepped in with a loaded Glock
Off that aroma therapy too, I open up with about 40 shots
If they told you somethin' pussy, they should've told you I had a grave for ya
I had you in the casket, suited up, lyin', better than a paid lawyer
You dead Roc, I don't think you listenin' fam'
I stacked rounds to make this body, I'm the Michelin Man
A poor guy's only meal how I'm grippin' this can'
Then give him bucks up front that's how I give an advance
Let's get straight to it
As soon as I spot him the K shootin'
After the ring, I retire this Baltimore hitter he Ray Lewis
Okay stupid? Now I think Space Jam once I get my hands on you Aak
And I'm a Monstar that's a beast that know how to handle the Roc(k)
It's the Bullpen, we're real MC's, how the crowd reactin'?
He just a SMACK rapper, y'all know he reach and take off his coat and get the crowd reaction
That's bullshit but I don't even care, it's whatever Roc
Cause if I reach in this coat you gon' get the biggest reaction that you ever got
Let's talk about his resume, I need everybody to peep how I'm ahead of Roc
Bro I was Surfin' through ya battles like, ""Yo this nigga gotta be a nerd at best.""
Cause he was strugglin' to handle that Calicoe
But you was doin' pretty good with Chess
Speakin' of Goodz, bro y'all battle almost turned into a fuckin' Dizaster
John John beat yo' ass so bad, you doin' this for damn near free and it's a couple years after
My Arsonal? Thick, I can let that K-Shine with that old red laser
I keep a gun wit' me, but my Hitman a Blood
So when that brim in his face he thinkin' he rematchin' Rum Nitty
These Hollows? Ill, Will have a nigga dancin' like JC
You better not run or the 12 come out, Kaboom
Now it's DNA all over my Shotgun
This ain't even mine, no it ain't, it's my bitch strap
I named this my ""C3 Ratchet""
And after these Clips smoke him it won't be rematches
But this gon' be Magic, this nigga Roc can't fuck wit' me
Yo Rich Dolarz! 'Bout to send you up some company
I got one! At the top of the chamber wit' his name on it
I let it Roc off to get Roc'd off then I rock off his chain on me
You lame homie
Glorifyin' you some Gun Bar King, but you ain't got no gun charges
Bro I be glorifyin' I don't play wit' them things at all, and they keep tryin' to give me more gun charges
That shit make me mad, think Kyrie leavin' I break his calves (Cavs)
I keep the tool in my drawers I'm that white boy off of 'Breaking Bad'
Speakin' of 'Breaking Bad', what got you thinkin' that you breakin' Bad?
Oh your mechanic ain't finish workin' on the whip so ya breaks is bad
Nigga I'll take ya cash but I ain't gon' rob you Roc
Like 12 just pulled me, shit I'm tryin' to hide you Roc(k)
He's some lil' fuckin' Gun Bar King? And y'all worried if I'm gonna survive or not?
I took four to the gut last month I just survived some shots
Ayo Roc!
I'm in ya buildin' with my buttas on I'm tryin' to creep tho'
I know Roc cold as ice, what the fuck y'all think I brought this heat fo'?
I knock on his door, throw my hand over the peephole
""Who is it?""
Baow! Four to the chest like Oladipo
I'll run in his crib, give his mother a slice
Then I'm fuckin' his wife
Like, ""Damn this Cave pussy was good"", so I fucked her twice
I seen his little daughters
He talkin' 'bout ""It is"", right now he can't stand me
Nigga, you better [?] cause you been fuckin' wit' them trannies
Aye I seen his little daughters I'm like, ""Hey"" and gave 'em both a bike
But no breaks so when they stop they run through the fuckin' light
I'm in his livin' room, big blunt while I clutch the pipe
Roc walk in to the worse Newz of his fuckin' life
I'm really 'bout that fuckin' life, you better ask around
Back 'em down like I've been workin' on my post moves with Shaq in town
Aye Brizz, it's aggravatin', it's a hospital, not a graduation
Once lil' Tay Tay get capped and gowned
I'm spazzin' now, I used to shoot it like this, I was scared of the view if I hit somebody
Now I look my victims in they eyes, I'm Geechi Gotti
Niggas try me, Atlanta gon' witness a damn body
This Bethany off that new Jumanji movie, a grown woman in a man's body
I'm from that Murder Mount, 2-5-2, that's what we 'bout
Raised up around those stakes like a tree house
So take it easy, cause I know ya family worship you Roc
This how I kill him and y'all forever have to worship his rock
I hold it down for this league, they notice me Roc
I'm that supermarket cart boy, I've been workin' a lot
Y'all now the supermarket cart boy he always be workin' the lot
But y'all be treatin' these niggas like they Jordan and Kobe, y'all been bias
And forget to mention the real fuckin' GOAT, I'm Len Bias
You know how many fuckin' niggas took my style and run? Yo give thanks bro
I'm runnin' down on all you niggas for my 5%, I'm Big Draco
This ain't shit though, there's nothin' lost to me bro, don't let this leave you scared
Think Verbal Warfare, you just got beat with bars
Y'all think I'm worried 'bout lil Tay Tay? This nigga hella bitch
Watch ya mouth, cause if not nigga, I'll put a shell in it
All my guns throwaways nigga, destroy the evidence
So if we wreck before you can get to sue (Tsu) we gon' settle it
Y'all know, get to Tsu, nah that's Surf son
Bro, I was so fucked up as a child I tried to stuff real bullets in my Nerf gun
Now-a-days, I be grippin' the hammer as soon as church done
God bring a man from the dirt but I Earth One!
I'm in the Cave, lookin' for this so called Batman like I'm from Gotham
I'm still gon' let this .4 get (forget) him, I ain't forgot him
I spot Roc and his whole family, that chopper rock him
Fuck it, I'm even boxin' the kids like Sock 'Em Bock 'Em
I run up on Ave like, ""Yo, what is yo' name?"" and you ain't like that
Take Brizz machete, he cryin' to get his knife back
I'm lookin' for Tay long ass neck to get a swipe at
His soul flyin', let's see if Trez can rebuttal his life back
It's a nice strap, I spot Tay then the hammer blam
BAOW! Paramedics charged with trafficking, I had 'em pushin' Roc(k) in the ambulance
....Jersey
Sike! I ain't Surf nigga
And ya daughter, she writin' books now, tryin' to be an author
All light bars, and she got it from her father
Tryin' to play me my nigga, why would you even bother
I'll have pieces of Roc(k) all in the hood like it's The Carter

[Girl in the crowd]
Fuck that nigga, Tay Roc!

[Bad Newz]
Fuck you!

I'm nice with the clippers, fuck a fade, I ain't a barber

I was fucked up when I heard that bad news about Bad Newz
Then John called me, said we battlin' I said, ""Damn...more bad news for Bad Newz.""
I mean, it's bad enough somebody shot him, now I gotta stop him?
How many times you get hit? Don't matter
This one round you not survivin'
Roc a problem, I got Crips and Bloods, I combined 'em
Send 'em at you, have you seein' blue and red like the cops behind him
Traumatize him, let it peel (pill) in his mouth; Oxycontin
You and your cheerleaders, I'm talkin' 'bout bodies piling
We wreck up ya shop, ya set'll get shot by the fire squadron
Hecklers will pop, we wet up the block; fire hydrant
Leave him somewhere no cop'll find him
Like a cornfield, that's how I get him out the picture
Take you to a crop and hide him
The shotty cockin', I'll molly whop him, his body rottin'
When it's loose on the rifle, the only time my stock is droppin'
Aye John, why you timin'?
The minute you yell ""time"" I ain't stoppin'
He couldn't get from behind these bars with Johnny Cochran
You grew up, watchin' me and it's not forgotten
You just one of them gun bar kids that rock a docket
I gotta kill you, it's not an option
I get close enough then left the fifth open up, we bottle poppin'
Aye, who gon' hurt Roc? That's who get the first, second then third shot
They find him in the trunk, blindfolded, Bird Box
I can have this pipe smokin' Holmes; Sherlock
I'll ice pick him, and twist it like a key that you turn lock
Aye, you choose, what the fuck you gon' do Newz?
I'll run up on ya man, like ""Weird news.""
He like, ""Who Newz?""
I have niggas that knew Newz actin' like they never knew Newz.""
Then pop lady, drop [?] his top red; NuNu (new Newz)
I'm too smooth, you gon' end up on Channel 2 News
Worldstar, YouTube
Try me, you gonna eat through tubes
Doc's gonna bring him applesauce, it goes through the tubes easy
If we don't kill 'em, we comin' back for Newz weekly (Newsweek)
We gon' do him too greasy, I'll chain you up, throw you in a box, then throw that in the lake he Houdini
Aye, cops discovered the body, it's too creepy
They found a Carolina nigga bodied, bloated and paler than Glueazy
Don't talk about who beat me until you beat me
You PG, I get paid, you do freebies
I'll break in ya crib while you sleepy, I'm too sneaky
Beat ya head with a lamp 'til I get a wish from that blue genie
Every nigga in my crew clap for me
I could send Chef and (in) Raw like my food Japanese
I could send Ave at him, grippin' two gats to squeeze
And if Newz stand in the way they'll give Newz (news) magazines
You always wanted to be one of them Cave dudes
Yes you did
Donald Trump talkin' 'bout CNN, you fake Newz
I will break [?] TV I hate Newz
My shooter'll get him, come back like, ""Yo, I got some great Newz""
I shouldn't have took this, cause you don't have great views
Thank me, for lettin' me kick it wit' a star, Bape shoes
Fuck wit' me, what is you drunk off of Grey Goose?
I'll take a bulldog and beat the breaks off of you until it break loose
Ain't no way you can take me for a rookie
John be trickin' off, meanin' he had you pay me for this pussy
Pause
You don't see a quarter of Roc amount
The chopper is what Roc'll mount
On somethin' that hit this nigga from Rocky Mount
Watch ya mouth! Why would he put you in this position?
End up paralyzed, there's nothin' you can do in that condition
Two choices, I give his bitch the Ruger or the Smith &
She gon' disappear and I bet Newz report her (reporter) missin'
Like GTA, I send my shooter on a mission
This sharpshooter ain't got nothin' to do with a submission
Scratch that, I take a shank like how they do it in the prison
They OD on him, I've overusin' a prescription, nigga
Summer Madness? NOME? You ain't did shit but keep it G
Why you think you a celebrity Newz? TMZ?
Drive-by, get hit, right out of a GMC
I'll hop out and handle the Unfinished Business; EPMD
Fuck a snitch! Before a hoe tell (hotel) 'bout mine, I'll air a B and be (Air BNB) out before check out time
What's this hoe's facade, my hitter pull up in a stolen car and leave a O in the middle of this GD, now go to God
Antwan, you'se a worker
John, you should fire Ant'
Rifle, scope with the ray I'll sent you on fire Ant'
Let ya bitch get tough like some kinda champ
Switchblade in the weave, chop through the roots like a marijuana plant
Better watch ya lips, poppin' shit, you know Roc can get, rock ya shit
Or I'll blast off, no rocket ship
Roc the shit, niggas watch me and they copy shit
Niggas studyin' Roc(k) I turned them to geologists
You're not as sick
Well, at least I acknowledged it
And all the shit you make up, you should be a cosmetologist
Six foot hole, ya body gon' rot inside of it
Cops gotta dig you up like archaeologists
Body shit, you stupid if you thinkin' Tay can't
Come to ya crib like it's a Raid like a can', I'll spray Ant'
BLAM! Drop him, soon as the can' pop him
Once I'm at his crib like an exterminator that's Ant' problem
Come see that I be all about it
If I gotta be extra, somethin' gon' happen to Newz, you can read all about it
[?] even about it, headshot, left a nigga lyin' like we ain't believe him about it
For this battle, you couldn't wait to even write
Probably some dumb shit like, ""When I took two shots, Roc ain't pray for me at night.""
You still walkin', talkin', breathin', right?
Niggas get shot everyday, you'll be aight
This battle, you the only one it mattered to
I took this cause YOU got shot and I felt bad for you
Sike I lied, I took this cause John said, ""Roc, I got a bag for you.""
This the perspective I'ma put it into
I've been on Flex, been to more cities, I get paid more, I fuck badder bitches, I'm cooler than you
The only thing you got that I don't got is some bullets in you
Shine killed you, now I gotta put you in ya place again
You got shot and survived to look death in the face again
Two shooters with ski masks on him
Put a Shotgun and K in his face like John John backed a rematch for him
Nah, my shooter fire metal 'til every bone in ya body Jell-O
He got a stick on him, purple ragged up; Donatello
He raise that damn can', BLAM BLAM!
And then I deuce deuce ya homie, that's the tiny weapon for Ant' man (Ant-Man)
I rap sick, hop up in Bad crib, crack wigs
Abusive daycare worker, this shit hit Bad kids
Ya throat slit, ya bitch head Roc(k), none of y'all aunt's live
I laid her tracks behind ya vocals
(What's that)
The ad-lib
Next stop, I take the whole drum clip, air it
At who?
(Who?)
Bad dad like he an unfit parent
Head leak, he get wrapped in a bad sheet
They won't ever be able to find Bad dad, he a deadbeat
You could've rapped all night, you would've just lost half this bag

In the present chapter we have not only a striking proof of Shakespeare's minute acquaintance with natural history, but of his remarkable versatility as a writer. Whilst displaying a most extensive knowledge of ornithology, he has further illustrated his subject by alluding to those numerous legends, popular sayings, and superstitions which have, in this and other countries, clustered round the feathered race. Indeed, the following pages are alone sufficient to show, if it were necessary, how fully he appreciated every branch of antiquarian lore; and what a diligent student he must have been in the pursuit of that wide range of information, the possession of which has made him one of the most many-sided writers that the world has ever seen. The numerous incidental allusions, too, by Shakspeare, to the folk-lore of bygone days, whilst showing how deeply he must have read and gathered knowledge from every available source, serve as an additional proof of his retentive memory, and marvellous power of embellishing his ideas by the most apposite illustrations. Unfortunately, however, these have, hitherto, been frequently lost sight of through the reader's unacquaintance with that extensive field of folk-lore which was so well known to the poet. For the sake of easy reference, the birds with which the present chapter deals are arranged alphabetically.

Barnacle-Goose.—There was a curious notion, very prevalent in former times, that this bird (Anser bernicla) was generated from the barnacle (Leilas anatifera), a shell-fish, growing on a flexible stem, and adhering to loose timber, bottoms of ships, &c., a metamorphosis to which Shakspeare alludes in the ""Tempest"" (iv. i), where he makes Caliban say—

""We shall lose our time, And all be turn’d to barnacles.""

This vulgar error, no doubt, originated in mistaking the fleshy peduncle of the shell-fish for the neck of a goose, the shell for its head, and the tentacula for a tuft of feathers. These shell-fish, therefore, bearing, as seen out of the water, a resemblance to the goose's neck, were ignorantly, and without investigation, confounded with geese themselves. In France, the barnacle-goose may be eaten on fast days, by virtue of this old belief in its fishy origin. Like other fictions this one had its variations, for sometimes the barnacles were supposed to grow on trees, and thence to drop into the sea, and become geese, as in Drayton's account of Furness, (Polyolb. 1622, Song 27, p. 1190). As early as the 12th century this idea was promulgated by Giraldus Cambrensis in his ""Topographia Hiberniæ."" Gerarde, who in the year 1597 published his ""Herball, or Generall Historie of Plantes,"" narrates the following:—""There are found in the north parts of Scotland, and the isles adjacent called Orcades, certain trees, whereon do grow certain shell-fishes, of a white colour, tending to russet, wherein are contained little living creatures; which shells in time of maturity do open, and out of them grow those little living things, which, falling into the water, do become fowls, whom we call barnacles, in the north of England brant geese, and in Lancashire tree geese; but the others that do fall upon the land perish, and do come to nothing. Thus much of the writings of others, and also
from the mouths of people of those parts, which may very well accord with truth. But what our eyes have seen and hands have touched, we shall declare. There is a small island in Lancashire called the Pile of Foulders, wherein are found the broken pieces of old ships, some whereof have been cast thither by shipwreck, and also the trunks or bodies, with the branches, of old rotten trees, cast up there likewise, whereon is found a certain spume or froth, that in time breedeth into certain shells, in shape like those of the mussel, but sharper pointed, and of a whitish colour; wherein is contained a thing in form like a lace of silk, one end whereof is fastened unto the inside of the shell, even as the fish of oysters and mussels are. The other end is made fast unto the belly of a rude mass or lump, which in time cometh to the shape and form of a bird; when it is perfectly formed the shell gapeth open, and the first thing that appeareth is the foresaid lace or string; next come the legs of the bird hanging out, and as it groweth greater it openeth the shell by degrees, till at length it is all come forth and hangeth only by the bill. In short space after it cometh to full maturity, and falleth into the sea, where it gathereth feathers and groweth to a fowl, bigger than a mallard, and lesser than a goose; having black legs and bill, or beak, and feathers black and white, spotted in such a manner as is our magpie, which the people of Lancashire call by no other name than a tree goose."" An interesting cut of these birds so growing is given by Mr Halliwell-Phillipps from a manuscript of the 14th century, who is of opinion that the barnacle mentioned by Caliban was the tree-goose. It is not to be supposed, however, that there were none who doubted this marvellous story, or who took steps to refute it. Belon, so long ago as 1551, says Mr Harting, and others after him, treated it with ridicule, and a refutation may be found in Willughby's ""Ornithology,"" which was edited by Ray in 1678. This vulgar error is mentioned by many of the old writers. Thus Bishop Hall, in his ""Virgidemiarum"" (Lib. iv., sat. 2), says:—

""The Scottish barnacle, if I might choose,
That of a worme doth waxe a winged goose.""

Butler, too, in his ""Hudibras,"" (III., ii. 1. 655), speaks of it; and Marston, in his ""Malecontent,"" (1604), has the following:—""Like your Scotch barnacle, now a block, instantly a worm, and presently a great goose.""

Blackbird—This favourite is called in the ""Midsummer Night's Dream"" (iii. 1.) an ousel, (old French, oisel), a term still used in the neighbourhood of Leeds:—

""The ousel cock so black of hue,
With orange tawny bill.""

In the 2d part of King Henry IV. (iii. 2) when Justice Shallow inquires of Justice Silence, ""And how doth my cousin?"" he is answered—

""Alas, a black ousel, cousin Shallow,"" a phrase which, no doubt, corresponded to our modern one, a ""black sheep."" In Spenser's ""Epithalamium"" (1. 82), the word occurs—

""The ousel shrills, the ruddock warbles soft.""

Buzzard.—Mr Staunton suggests that in the following passage of the ""Taming of the Shrew"" (ii. 1), a play is intended upon the words, and that in the second line, ""buzzard"" means a beetle from its peculiar buzzing noise—

""O slow-wing’d turtle! shall a buzzard take thee?
Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.""

The beetle was formerly called a buzzard; and in Staffordshire, a cock-chafer is termed a hum-buz. In Northamptonshire, we find a proverb, ""I'm between a hawk and a buzzard,"" which means, ""I don't know what to do, or how to act.""

Chaffinch.—Some think that this bird is alluded to in the song in the ""Midsummer Night's Dream"" (iii. 1), where the expression ""Finch"" is used; the chaffinch having always been a favourite cage bird with the lower-classes. In ""Troilus and Cressida"" (v. 1), Thersites calls Patroclus a ""finch-egg,"" which was evidently meant as a term of reproach. Others again consider the phrase is equivalent to coxcomb.

Chough.—In using this word, Shakespeare probably in most cases meant the jackdaw; for in ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" (iii. 2), he says—

""Russet-pated choughs, many in sort,
Rising and cawing at the gun's report.""

the term russet-pated being applicable to the jackdaw, but not to the real chough. In ""1 Henry IV."" (v. 1), Prince Henry calls Falstaff chewet—""Peace, chewet, peace""—in allusion no doubt to the chough or jackdaw, for common birds have always had a variety of names.  Such an appellation would be a proper reproach to Falstaff, for his meddling and impertinent talk. Steevens, and Malone, however, finding that chewets were little round pies made of minced meat, thought that the Prince compared Falstaff for his unseasonable chattering, to a minced pie. Cotgrave  describes the French ""chouette;"" as an owlet; also, a ""chough,"" which many consider to be the simple and satisfactory explanation of chewet. Belon in his ""History of Birds"" (Paris, 1855), speaks of the chouette as the smallest kind of chough or crow. Again, in ""1 Henry IV."" (ii. 2), in the amusing scene where Falstaff, with the Prince and Poins, meet to rob the travellers at Gadshill, Falstaff calls the victims ""fat chuffs,"" probably, says Mr Harting, who connects the word with chough, from their strutting about with much noise. Nares, too, in his explanation of chuff, says, that some suppose it to be from chough which is similarly pronounced, and means a kind of sea-bird generally esteemed a stupid one. Various other meanings are given. Thus, Mr Gifford affirms that chuff is always used in a bad sense, and means ""a coarse unmannered clown, at once sordid and wealthy;"" and Mr Halliwell-Phillipps explains it as spoken in contempt for a fat person. In Northamptonshire, we find the word chuff used to denote a person in good condition, as in Clare's ""Village Minstrel""—

""His chuff cheeks dimpling in a fondling smile.""

Shakespeare alludes to the practice of teaching choughs to talk, although from the following passages he does not appear to have esteemed their talking powers of much value, for in ""All's Well that Ends Well"" (iv. 1), he says—

""Choughs’ language, gabble enough, and good enough.""
And in Tempest (ii. 1), he represents Antonio as saying—

""There be that can rule Naples
As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate
As amply and unnecessarily
As this Gonzalo; I myself could make
A chough of as deep chat.""

Shakespeare always refers to the jackdaw as the ""daw."" The chough or jackdaw was one of the birds considered ominous by our forefathers, an allusion to which occurs in ""Macbeth"" (iii. 4.)—

""Augurs and understood relations have,
By magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth
The secret’st man of blood.""

At the present day this bird is not without its folklore, and there is a Norwich rhyme to the following effect —

""When three daws are seen on St Peter's vane together,
Then we're sure to have bad weather.""

In the north, too, of England the flight of jackdaws down the chimney is held to presage death.

Cock.—The beautiful notion which represents the cock as crowing all night long on Christmas Eve, and by its vigilance dispelling every kind of malignant spirit and evil influence, is graphically mentioned in ""Hamlet"" (i. 1), where Marcellus, speaking of the ghost, says—

""It faded on the crowing of the cock.
Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes,
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
So hallow’d and so gracious is the time.""

In short, there is a complete prostration of the powers of darkness; and thus, for the time being, mankind is said to be released from the influence of all those evil forces which otherwise exert such sway. The notion that spirits fly at cock-crow is very ancient, and is mentioned by the Christian poet Prudentius, who flourished in the beginning of the fourth century. There is also a hymn, said to have been composed by St Ambrose, and formerly used in the Salisbury Service, which so much resembles the following speech of Horatio (i. 1), that one might almost suppose Shakespeare had seen it —

""The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
The extravagant and erring spirit hies
To his confine.""

This disappearance of spirits at cock-crow is further alluded to (i. 2)—

""The morning cock crew loud,
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
And vanish’d from our sight.""

Blair, too, in his ""Grave"" has these graphic words—

""The tale
Of horrid apparition, tall and ghastly,
That walks at dead of night, or takes his stand
O’er some new-open’d grave, and strange to tell,
Evanishes at crowing of the cock.""

This superstition has not entirely died out in England, and a correspondent of ""Notes and Queries"" relates an amusing legend current in Devonshire:—""Mr N. was a squire who had been so unfortunate as to sell his soul to the Devil, with the condition that after his funeral the fiend should take possession of his skin. He had also persuaded a neighbour to be present on the occasion of the flaying. On the death of Mr N. this man went in a state of great alarm to the parson of the parish and asked his advice. By him he was told to fulfil his engagement, but he must be sure and carry a cock into the church with him. On the night after the funeral the man proceeded to the church armed with the cock, and, as an additional security, took up his position in the parson's pew. At twelve o'clock the devil arrived, opened the grave, took the corpse from the coffin, and flayed it. When the operation was concluded he held the skin up before him and remarked, 'Well, ’twas not worth coming for after all, for it is all full of holes!' As he said this, the cock crew, whereupon the fiend, turning round to the man, exclaimed, 'If it had not been for the bird you have got there under your arm, I would have your skin too!' But, thanks to the cock, the man got home safe again."" Various origins have been assigned to this superstition, which Hampson 2 regards as a misunderstood tradition of some Sabæan fable. The cock, he adds, which seems by its early voice to call forth the sun, was esteemed a sacred solar bird, hence it was also sacred to Mercury, one of the personifications of the sun.

A very general amusement up to the end of the last century was cock-fighting, a diversion of which mention is occasionally made by Shakespeare, as in ""Antony and Cleopatra"" (ii. 3)—

""His cocks do win the battle still of mine,
When it is all to nought.""

And again Hamlet says (v. 2)—

""O, I die, Horatio;
The potent poison quite o’er-crows my spirit""

—meaning the poison triumphs over him, as a cock over his beaten antagonist. Formerly, cock-fighting entered into the occupations of the old and young. Schools had their cockfights. Travellers agreed with coachmen that they were to wait a night if there was a cock-fight in any town through which they passed. When country gentlemen had sat long at table, and the conversation had turned upon the relative merits of their several birds, a cockfight often resulted, as the birds in question were brought for the purpose into the dining-room. Cock-fighting was practised on Shrove Tuesday to a great extent, and, in the time of Henry VII., seems to have been practised within the precincts of Court. The earliest mention of this pastime in England is by Fitzstephens, in 1191. Happily, now-a-days, cock-fighting is by law a misdemeanour, and punishable by penalty. One of the popular terms for a cock beaten in a fight was ""a craven,"" to which we find a reference in the ""Taming of the Shrew"" (ii. 1)—""No cock of mine; you crow too like a craven."" We may also compare the expression in Henry V. (iv. 7)—""He is a craven and a villain else."" In the old appeal or wager of battle, in our common law, we are told, on the authority of Lord Coke, that the party who confessed himself wrong, or refused to fight, was to pronounce the word cravent, and judgment was at once given against him. Singer 3 says the term may be satisfactorily traced from crant, créant, the old French word for an act of submission. It is so written in the old metrical romance of ""Ywaine and Gawaine"" (Ritson i. 133)—

""Or yelde the til us als creant.""
and in ""Richard Coeur de Lion"" (Weber ii. 208)—

""On knees he fel down, and cryde, crêaunt.""
It then became cravant, cravent, and at length craven.


In the time of Shakespeare, the word cock was used as a vulgar corruption or purposed disguise of the name of God, an instance of which occurs in Hamlet (iv. 5)—""By cock, they are to blame."" This irreverent alteration of the sacred name is found at least a dozen times in Heywood's ""Edward the Fourth,"" where one passage is—

""Herald—Sweare on this booke, King Lewis, so help you God,
You mean no otherwise then you have said.
King Lewis—So helpe me Cock as I dissemble not.""

We find, too, other allusions to the sacred name, as in ""cock's-passion,"" ""cock's-body;"" as in ""Taming of the Shrew"" (iv. i)—""Cock's passion, silence!"" A not uncommon oath, too, in Shakespeare's time was ""Cock and pie""—cock referring to God, and pie being supposed to mean the service-book of the Romish Church; a meaning which, says Mr Dyce, seems much more probable than Douce's supposition that this oath was connected with the making of solemn vows by knights in the days of chivalry, during entertainments, at which a roasted peacock was served up. It is used by Justice Shallow (2 Henry IV., v. 1)—""By cock and pye, sir, you shall not away to-night."" We may also compare the expression in the old play of ""Soliman and Perseda"" (1599)—""By cock and pye and mousefoot."" Mr Harting  says the ""Cock and Pye"" (i.e., magpie) was an ordinary ale-house sign, and may have thus become a subject for the vulgar to swear by.

The phrase, ""Cock-a-hoop,"" which occurs in ""Romeo and Juliet"" (i. 5)—

""You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!""

—no doubt refers to a reckless person, who takes the cock or tap out of a cask, and lays it on the top or hoop of the barrel, thus letting all the contents of the cask run out. Formerly, a quart pot was called a hoop, being formed of staves bound together with hoops like barrels. There were generally three hoops to such a pot; hence, in ""2 Henry VI."" (iv. 2), one of Jack Cade's popular reformations was to increase their number, ""The three-hooped pot shall have ten hoops; and I will make it felony to drink small beer."" Some, however, consider the term Cock-a-hoop  refers to the boastful crowing of the cock.

In ""King Lear"" (iii. 2) Shakespeare speaks of the ""cataracts and hurricanoes"" as having—

""Drenched our steeples, drowned the cocks!""

Vanes on the tops of steeples were in days gone by made in the form of a cock—hence weathercocks—and put up, in papal times, to remind the clergy of watchfulness. Apart, too, from symbolism, the large tail of the cock was well adapted to turn with the wind.

Cormorant.—The proverbial voracity of this bird gave rise to a man of large appetite being likened to it, a sense in which Shakespeare employs the word, as in ""Coriolanus"" (i. 1)—""The cormorant belly;"" in ""Love's Labour's Lost"" (i. 1)—""Cormorant devouring time;"" and in ""Troilus and Cressida"" (ii. 2)—""This cormorant war."" ""Although,"" says Mr Harting,  ""Shakespeare mentions the cormorant in several of his plays, he has nowhere alluded to the sport of using these birds, when trained, for fishing; a fact which is singular, since he often speaks of the then popular pastime of hawking, and he did not die until some years after James I. had made fishing with cormorants a fashionable amusement.""

Crow.—This has from the earliest times been reckoned a bird of bad omen; and in ""Julius Cæsar,"" (v. 1), Cassius, on the eve of battle, predicted a defeat, because, to use his own words:—

""Crows and kites
Fly o’er our heads and downward look on us,
As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem
A canopy most fatal, under which
Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.""

Allusions to the same superstition occur in ""Troilus and Cressida"" (i. 2); ""King John"" (v. 2), etc. Virgil (Bucolic i., 18), mentions the croaking of the crow as a bad omen:—

""Sæpe sinistra cava prædixit ab ilice cornix.""
And Butler in his ""Hudibras"" (part ii, canto 3), remarks:—

""Is it not ominous in all countries,
When crows and ravens croak upon trees.""

Even children now-a-days regard with no friendly feelings this bird of ill-omen; 1 and in the north of England there is a rhyme to the following effect:—

""Crow, crow, get out of my sight,
Or else I'll eat thy liver and lights.""

Among other allusions, mentioned by Shakspeare, to the crow, may be noticed the crow-keeper—a person employed to drive away crows from the fields. At present, in all the midland counties, a boy set to drive away the birds is said to keep birds; hence, a stuffed figure, now called a scare-crow, was also called a crow-keeper, as in ""King Lear"" (iv. 6):—

""That fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper.""
One of Tusser's directions for September is—

""No sooner a-sowing, but out by-and-by,
With mother or boy that alarum can cry:
And let them be armed with a sling or a bow,
To scare away pigeon, the rook, or the crow.""

In ""Romeo and Juliet,"" (i. 4), a scare-crow seems meant—

""Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper.""

Among further references to this practice, is that in ""1 Henry VI."" (i. 4), where Lord Talbot relates that, when a prisoner in France, he was publicly exhibited in the market-place:—

""Here, said they, is the terror of the French,
The scarecrow that affrights our children so.""
And once more, in ""Measure for Measure,"" (ii. 1):—

""We must not make a scare-crow of the law,
Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,
And let it keep one shape, till custom make it
Their perch and not their terror.""

The phrase ""to pluck a crow"" is to complain good-naturedly but reproachfully, and to threaten retaliation. It occurs in ""Comedy of Errors,"" (iii. 1):—""We'll pluck a crow together."" Sometimes the word pull is substituted for pluck, as in Butler's ""Hudibras,"" part ii. canto 2:—

""If not, resolve before we go
That you and I must pull a crow.""

The crow has been regarded as the emblem of darkness, which has not escaped the notice of Shakspeare, who in ""Pericles"" (iv. introd.), speaking of the white dove, says:—

""With the dove of Paphos might the crow
Vie feathers white.""

Cuckoo.—Many superstitions have clustered round the cuckoo, and both in this country and abroad it is looked upon as a mysterious bird, being supposed to possess the gift of second sight, a notion referred to in ""Love's Labour's Lost"" (v. 2):—

""Cuckoo, cuckoo:  O word of fear,
Unpleasing to a married ear.""

And again, in ""Midsummer Night's Dream,"" (iii. 1), Bottom sings:—

""The plain-song cuckoo gray,
Whose note full many a man doth mark,
And dares not answer nay.""


It is still a common idea that the cuckoo, if asked, will tell anyone, by the repetition of its cries, how long he has to live. The country lasses in Sweden count the cuckoo's call to ascertain how many years they have to remain unmarried, but they generally shut their ears and run away on hearing it a few times.  Among the Germans the notes of the cuckoo, when heard in spring for the first time, are considered a good omen. Cæsarius (A.D. 1222), tells us of a convertite who was about to become a monk, but changed his mind on hearing the cuckoo's call, and counting twenty-two repetitions of it. ""Come,"" said he, ""I have certainly twenty-two years still to live, and why should I mortify myself during all that time. I will go back to the world, enjoy its delights for twenty years, and devote the remaining two to penitence.""  In England, the peasantry salute the cuckoo with the following invocation:—

""Cuckoo, cherry-tree,
Good bird tell me,
How many years have I to live.""

the allusion to the cherry-tree having probably originated in the popular fancy, that before the cuckoo ceases its song, it must eat three good meals of cherries. Pliny mentions the belief, that when the cuckoo came to maturity, it devoured the bird which had reared it; a superstition several times alluded to by Shakespeare. Thus, in ""King Lear,"" (i. 4) the Fool remarks—

""The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long,
That it's had it head bit off by it young.""

Again, in ""1 Henry IV."" (v. 1), Worcester says—

""And being fed by us you used us so
As that ungentle gull, the cuckoo's bird,
Useth the sparrow; did oppress our nest;
Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk
That even our love durst not come near your sight
For fear of swallowing.""

Once more, the opinion that the cuckoo made no nest of its own, but laid its eggs in that of another bird, is mentioned in ""Antony and Cleopatra"" (ii. 6):—

""Thou dost o’er-count me of my father's house;
But, since the cuckoo builds not for himself,
Remain in’t as thou mayst.""

It has been remarked, however, in reference to the common idea that the young cuckoo illtreats its foster mother, that if we watch the movements of the two birds, when the younger is being fed, we cannot much wonder at this piece of folk-lore. When the cuckoo opens its great mouth, the diminutive nurse places her own head so far within its precincts, that it has the exact appearance of a voluntary surrender to decapitation.

The notion ""which couples the name of the cuckoo with the character of the man whose wife is unfaithful to him, appears to have been derived from the Romans, and is first found in the middle ages in France, and in the countries of which the modern language is derived from the Latin. But the ancients more correctly gave the name of the bird, not to the husband of the faithless wife, but to her paramour, who might justly be supposed to be acting the part of the cuckoo. They applied the name of the bird in whose nest the cuckoo's eggs were usually deposited—'carruca'—to the husband. It is not quite clear how, in the passage from classic to mediæval, the application of the term was transferred to the husband."" In further allusion to this bird, we may quote the following from ""All's Well that Ends Well"" (i. 3):—

""For I the ballad will repeat,
Which men full true will find,
Your marriage comes by destiny,
Your cuckoo sings by kind.""

The cuckoo has generally been regarded as the harbinger of spring, and according to a Gloucestershire rhyme—

""The cuckoo comes in April,
Sings a song in May;
Then in June another tune,
And then she flies away.""

Thus, in ""1 Henry IV."" (iii. 2), Henry IV., alluding to his predecessor, says—

""So when he had occasion to be seen,
He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
Heard, not regarded.""

In ""Love's Labour's Lost"" (v. 2), spring is maintained by the cuckoo, in those charming sonnets descriptive of the beauties of the country at this season.

The word cuckoo has, from the earliest times, been used as a term of reproach; and Plautus has introduced it on more than one occasion. In this sense we find it quoted by Shakespeare in ""1 Henry IV."" (ii. 4):—""O’ horseback, ye cuckoo."" The term cuckold, too, which so frequently occurs throughout Shakespeare's Plays, is generally derived from cuculus; from the practice already alluded to of depositing its eggs in other birds’ nests.

Domestic Fowl.—In the ""Tempest"" (v. 1), the word chick is used as a term of endearment, ""Nay arise, chick, &c.;"" and in ""Macbeth"" (iv. 3), Macduff speaks of his children as ""all my pretty chickens."" In ""Coriolanus"" (v. 3), hen is applied to a woman—""Poor hen, fond of no second brood;"" and in ""Taming of the Shrew"" (ii. 1), Petruchio says, ""So Kate will be my hen;"" and, once more, ""1 Henry IV."" (iii. 3), Falstaff says, ""How now, Dame Partlet, the hen?"" In ""Othello"" (i. 3), Iago applies the term ""guinea-hen"" to Desdemona, a cant phrase in Shakespeare's day for a fast woman.

Dove.—Among the many beautiful allusions to this bird we may mention one in ""Hamlet"" (v. 1), where Shakespeare speaks of the dove only laying two eggs.

""As patient as the female dove
When that her golden couplets are disclosed.""

The young nestlings, when first disclosed, are only covered with a yellow down, and the mother rarely leaves the nest, in consequence of the tenderness of her young; hence the dove has been made an emblem of patience. In ""2 Henry IV."" (iv. 1), it is spoken of as the symbol of peace—""The dove, and very blessed spirit of peace;"" and in the ""Taming of the Shrew"" (ii. 1), we find the expression ""as modest as the dove."" Its love, too, is several times referred to, as in ""Romeo"" (ii. 1), ""Pronounce but—'love' and 'dove';"" and in ""1 Henry VI."" (ii. 2), Burgundy says—

""Like to a pair of loving turtle-doves,
That could not live asunder day or night.""
This bird has, also, been regarded as the emblem of fidelity, as in the following graphic passage in ""Troilus and Cressida"" (iii. 2):—

""As true as steel, as plantage to the moon,
As sun to day, as turtle to her mate,
As iron to adamant, as earth to the centre.""

and in ""Winter's Tale"" (iv. 4), we read—""Turtles pair, that never mean to part."" Its modesty is alluded to in the ""Taming of the Shrew"" (ii. 1)—""Modest as the dove;"" and its innocence in ""2 Henry VI."" (iii. 1), is mentioned, where King Henry says—

""Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent
From meaning treason to our royal person
As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove:
The duke is virtuous, mild and too well given
To dream on evil or to work my downfall.""

The custom of giving a pair of doves or pigeons as a present or peace-offering, is alluded to in ""Titus Andronicus"" (iv. 4), where the Clown says, ""God and Saint Stephen give you good den: I have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here;"" and when Gobbo tried to find favour with Bassanio in ""Merchant of Venice"" (ii. 2), he began by saying—""I have here a dish of doves, that I would bestow on your worship."" Shakespeare alludes in several places to the ""doves of Venus,"" as in ""Venus and Adonis:""—

""Thus weary of the world, away she (Venus) hies,
And yokes her silver doves; by whose swift aid
Their mistress mounted through the empty skies
In her light chariot quickly is conveyed;
Holding their course to Paphos, where their queen
Means to immure herself and not be seen.""


and in ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" (i. 1), where Hermia speaks of ""the simplicity of Venus’ doves."" This will also explain, says Mr Harting, the reference to ""the dove of Paphos"" in ""Pericles"" (iv., Introduction). The towns of Old and New Paphos are situated on the south-west extremity of the coast of Cyprus. Old Paphos is the one generally referred to by the poets, being the peculiar seat of the worship of Venus, who was fabled to have been wafted thither, after her birth amid the waves. The ""dove of Paphos"" may therefore be considered as synonymous with the ""dove of Venus.""

Mahomet, we are told, had a dove, which he used to feed with wheat out of his ear; when hungry, the dove lighted on his shoulder, and thrust its bill in to find its breakfast;—Mahomet persuading the rude and simple Arabians that it was the Holy Ghost that gave him advice. Hence, in ""1 Henry VI."" (i. 2), the question is asked—

""Was Mahomet inspired with a dove?""

Duck.—A barbarous pastime in Shakespeare's time was hunting a tame duck in the water with spaniels. For the performance of this amusement it was necessary to have recourse to a pond of water sufficiently extensive to give the duck plenty of room for making its escape from the dogs when closely pursued: which it did by diving as often as any of them came near it, hence the following allusion in ""Henry V."" (ii. 3)—

""And hold-fast is the only dog, my duck.""

""To swim like a duck"" is a common proverb, which occurs in the ""Tempest"" (ii. 2), where Trinculo, in reply to Stephano's question how he escaped, says: ""Swum ashore, man, like a duck; I can swim like a duck, I'll be sworn.""

Eagle.—From the earliest time this bird has been associated with numerous popular fancies and superstitions, many of which have not escaped the notice of Shakspeare. A notion of very great antiquity attributes to it the power of gazing at the sun undazzled, to which Spenser in his ""Hymn of Heavenly Beauty"" refers:—

""And like the native brood of eagle's kind,
On that bright sun of glory fix thine eyes.""

In ""Love's Labour's Lost,"" (iv. 3), Biron says of Rosaline:—

""What peremptory eagle-sighted eye
Dares look upon the heaven of her brow,
That is not blinded by her majesty?""

And in 3 Henry VI. (ii. 1), Richard says to Edward, Prince of Wales:—

""Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,
Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun.""

The French naturalist, Lacepede, has calculated that the clearness of vision in birds is nine times more extensive than that of the farthest-sighted man. The eagle, too, has always been proverbial for its great power of flight, and on this account has had assigned to it the sovereignty of the feathered race. Aristotle and Pliny both record the legend of the wren disputing for the crown, a tradition which is still found in Ireland: —The birds all met together one day and settled among themselves that whichever of them could fly highest was to be the king of them all. Well, just as they were starting, the little rogue of a wren perched itself on the eagle's tail. So they flew and flew ever so high, till the eagle was miles above all the rest, and could not fly another stroke, for he was so tired. ""Then,"" says he, ""I'm the king of the birds,"" says he; ""hurroo!"" ""You lie,"" says the wren, darting up a perch and a-half above the big fellow. The eagle was so angry to think how he was outwitted by the wren, that when the latter was coming down he gave him a stroke of his wing, and from that day the wren has never been able to fly higher than a hawthorn bush. The swiftness of the eagle's flight is spoken of in ""Timon of Athens,"" (i. 1):—

""An eagle flight, bold, and forth on,
Leaving no track behind.""

The great age, too, of the eagle is well known; and the words of the psalmist are familiar to most readers:—

""His youth shall be renewed like the eagle's.""

Apemantus, however, asks of Timon (""Timon of Athens,"" iv. 3):—

""Will these moss’d trees,
That have outlived the eagle, page thy heels,
And skip where thou point’st out?""

Tuberville, in his ""Book of Falconry,"" 1575, says that the great age of this bird has been ascertained from the circumstance of its always building its eyrie or nest in the same place. The Romans considered the eagle a bird of good omen, and its presence in time of battle was supposed to foretell victory. Thus, in ""Julius Cæsar,"" (v. 1), we read:—

""Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign
Two mighty eagles fell; and there they perch’d,
Gorging and feeding from our soldiers’ hands.""

It was selected for the Roman legionary standard, through being the king and most powerful of all birds. As a bird of good omen it is mentioned also in ""Cymbeline,"" (i. 1):—

""I chose an eagle, and did avoid a puttock.""
and in another scene (iv. 2), the Soothsayer relates how ""Last night the very gods shew’d me a vision"": thus:—

""I saw Jove's bird, the Roman eagle, wing’d
From the spongy south to this part of the west,
There vanish’d in the sunbeams: which portends
(Unless my sins abuse my divination),
Success to th’ Roman host.""

The conscious superiority of the eagle is depicted by Tamora in ""Titus Andronicus,"" (iv. 4):—

""The eagle suffers little birds to sing,
And is not careful what they mean thereby,
Knowing that with the shadow of his wing,
He can at pleasure stint their melody.""


Goose.—This bird was the subject of many quaint proverbial phrases often used in the old popular writers. Thus, a tailor's goose was a jocular name for his pressing iron, probably from its being often roasting before the fire, an allusion to which occurs in ""Macbeth,"" (ii. 3):—

""Come in, tailor; here you may roast your goose.""

The ""wild-goose chase,"" which is mentioned in ""Romeo and Juliet"" (ii. 4)—

""Mercutio—Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have done.""

—was a kind of horse-race, which resembled the flight of wild-geese. Two horses were started together, and whichever rider could get the lead, the other was obliged to follow him over whatever ground the foremost jockey chose to go. That horse which could distance the other won the race. This reckless sport is enumerated by Burton, in his ""Anatomy of Melancholy,"" as a recreation much in vogue in his time among gentlemen. The term, ""Winchester goose,"" was a cant phrase for a certain venereal disease, because the stews in Southwark were under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Winchester, to whom Gloucester tauntingly applies the term in the following passage (""1 Henry VI.,"" i. 3):—

""Winchester goose, I cry, a rope! a rope!""

In ""Troilus and Cressida"" (v. 10), there is a further allusion—

""Some galled goose of Winchester would hiss.""

Ben Jonson  calls it—

""The Winchestrian goose,
Bred on the banke in time of Popery,
When Venus there maintain’d the mystery.""

""Plucking geese"" was formerly a barbarous sport of boys (""Merry Wives of Windsor,"" v. 1), which consisted in stripping a living goose of its feathers.

In ""Coriolanus"" (i. 4), the goose is spoken of as the emblem of cowardice. Marcius says—

""You souls of geese,
That hear the shapes of men, how have you run
From slaves that apes would beat.""

Goldfinch.—The Warwickshire name for this bird is ""Proud Tailor,"" to which, some commentators think, the words in ""1 Henry IV."" (iii. 1) refer

""Lady P.—I will not sing.
Hotsp.—’Tis the next way to turn tailor, or be red-breast teacher.""

It has, therefore, been suggested that the passage should be read thus—""’Tis the next way to turn tailor, or red-breast teacher,"" i.e., ""to turn teacher of goldfinches or redbreasts."" 2 Singer, 3 however, explains the words thus—""Tailors, like weavers, have ever been remarkable for their vocal skill. Percy is jocular in his mode of persuading his wife to sing; and this is a humorous turn which he gives to his argument, 'Come, sing.' 'I will not sing.' '’Tis the next (i.e., the readiest, nearest) way to turn tailor, or redbreast teacher'—the meaning being, to sing is to put yourself upon a level with tailors and teachers of birds.""

Gull.—Shakespeare often uses this word as synonymous with fool. Thus in Henry V. (iii. 6), he says—

""Why, ’tis a gull, a fool.""
The same play upon the word occurs in ""Othello"" (v. 2), and in ""Timon of Athens"" (ii. 1). In ""Twelfth Night"" (v. 1), Malvolio asks—

""Why have you suffer’d me to be imprison’d,
Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,.
And made the most notorious geck and gull
That e’er invention played on? tell me why.""

It is also used to express a trick or imposition, as in ""Much Ado About Nothing"" (ii. 3)—""I should think this a gull, but that the white-bearded fellow speaks it."" 1 ""Gull-catchers,"" or ""gull-gropers,"" to which reference is made in ""Twelfth Night""(ii. 5), where Fabian, on the entry of Maria, exclaims—

""Here comes my noble gull-catcher.""

were the names by which sharpers were known in Shakespeare's time.  The ""gull-catcher"" was generally an old usurer, who lent money to a gallant at an ordinary, who had been unfortunate in play. 4 Decker devotes a chapter to this character in his ""Lanthorne and Candle-light,"" 1612. According to him, ""the gull-groper is commonly an old monymonger, who having travailed through all the follyes of the world in his youth, knowes them well, and shunnes them in his age, his whole felicitie being to fill his bags with golde and silver."" The person so duped was termed a gull, and the trick also. In that disputed passage in the ""Tempest"" (ii. 2), where Caliban, addressing Trinculo, says—

""Sometimes I'll get thee
Young scamels from the rock.""

some think that the sea-mew, or sea-gull, is intended, sea-mall, or sea-mell, being still a provincial name for this bird. Mr Stevenson, in his ""Birds of Norfolk"" (ii. p. 260), tells us that ""the female bar-tailed godwit is called a 'scammell' by the gunners of Blakeney. But as this bird is not a rock-breeder, 6 it cannot be the one intended in the present passage, if we regard it as an accurate description from a naturalist's point of view."" Holt says that ""scam"" is a limpet, and scamell probably a diminutive. Mr Dyce 7 reads ""Scamels,"" i.e., the kestrel, stannel, or windhover, which breeds in rocky situations, and high cliffs on our coasts. He also further observes that this accords well with the context ""from the rock,"" and adds that staniel or staunyel occurs in ""Twelfth Night"" (ii. 5), where all the old editions exhibit the gross misprint, ""stallion.""

Hawk.—The diversion of catching game with hawks was very popular in Shakespeare's time, and hence, as might be expected, we find many scattered allusions to it throughout his plays. The training of a hawk for the field was an essential part of the education of a young Saxon nobleman; and the present of a well-trained hawk was a gift to be welcomed by a king. Edward the Confessor spent much of his leisure time in either hunting or hawking; and in the reign of Edward III. we read how the Bishop of Ely attended the service of the church at Bermondsey, Southwark, leaving his hawk in the cloister, which in the meantime was stolen—the bishop solemnly excommunicating the thieves. On one occasion Henry VIII. met with a serious accident when pursuing his hawk at Hitchin in Hertfordshire. In jumping over a ditch, his pole broke, and he fell headlong into the muddy-water, where he was with some difficulty rescued by one of his followers. Sir Thomas Moore, writing in the reign of Henry VIII., describing the state of manhood, makes a young man say—

""Man-hod I am, therefore I me delyght
To hunt and hawke, to nourish up and fede
The greyhounde to the course, the hawke to th’ flight,
And to bestryde a good and lusty stede.""

In noticing then, Shakespeare's allusions to this sport, we have a good insight into its various features, and also gain a knowledge of the several terms associated with it. Thus frequent mention is made of the word ""haggard""—a wild untrained hawk—and in the following allegory (""Taming of the Shrew,"" iv. 1), where it occurs, much of the knowledge of falconry is comprised:—

""My falcon now is sharp and passing empty;
And till she stoop she must not be full-gorged,

For then she never looks upon her lure.
Another way I have to man my haggard,
To make her come and know her keeper's call,
That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites,
That bate and beat and will not be obedient.
She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;
Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not.""

Further allusions occur in ""Twelfth Night"" (iii. 1), where Viola says of the Clown:—

""This fellow is wise enough to play the fool;
And to do that well craves a kind of wit:
He must observe their mood on whom he jests,
The quality of persons, and the time,
And, like the haggard, check at every feather
That comes before his eye.""

In ""Much Ado about Nothing,"" Hero (iii. 1), speaking of Beatrice says that—

""her spirits are as coy and wild
As haggerds of the rock.""

And Othello (iii. 3), mistrusting Desdemona, and likening her to a hawk, exclaims—

""If I do prove her haggard,—
I’ld whistle her off.""

The word ""check"" alluded to above was a term in falconry applied to a hawk when she forsook her proper game and followed some other of inferior kind that crossed her in her flight 3—being mentioned again in Hamlet (iv. 7), where the king says—

""If he be now return’d,
As checking at his voyage.""


Another common expression used in falconry is ""tower,"" applied to certain hawks, etc., which tower aloft, soar spirally to a height in the air, and thence swoop upon their prey. In ""Macbeth"" (ii. 4), we read of ""a falcon, towering in her pride of place;"" in ""2 Henry VI."" (ii. 1), Suffolk says, ""My lord protector's hawks do tower so well;"" and in ""King John"" (v. 2), the Bastard says, ""And, like an eagle o’er his aery 1 towers.""

The word ""quarry"" which occurs several times in Shakespeare's plays, in some instances, means the ""game or prey sought."" The etymology has, says Nares, been variously attempted, but with little success. It may, perhaps, originally have meant the square, or inclosure (carrée) into which the game was driven (as is still practised in other countries), and hence the application of it to the game there caught, would be a natural extension of the term. Randle Holme, in his ""Academy of Armory"" (Book II., c. xi. p. 240), defines it as ""the fowl which the hawk flyeth at, whether dead or alive."" It was also equivalent to a heap of slaughtered game, as in the following passages. In ""Coriolanus"" (i. 1), Caius Marcius says—""I’ld make a quarry with thousands of these quarter’d slaves."" In ""Macbeth"" (iv. 3) 2 we read ""The quarry of these murder’d deer,"" and in ""Hamlet"" (v. 2), ""This quarry cries on havoc.""

Another term in falconry is ""stoop,"" or ""swoop,'' denoting the hawk's violent descent from a height upon its prey. In ""Taming of the Shrew"" (iv. 1) the expression occurs, ""Till she stoop, she must not be full-gorged."" In ""Henry V."" (iv. 1), King Henry, speaking of the king, says, ""Though his affections are higher mounted than ours, yet when they stoop, they stoop with the like wing."" In ""Macbeth,"" too (iv. 3), Macduff, referring to the cruel murder of his children, exclaims, ""What! at one fell swoop?"" 1 Webster, in the ""White Devil,"" 2 says—

""If she [i.e., Fortune] give aught, she deals it in small parcels,
That she may take away all at one swoop.""

Shakespeare gives many incidental allusions to the hawk's trappings. Thus in ""Lucreece"" he says—

""Harmless Lucretia, marking what he tells
With trembling fear, as fowl hear falcon's bells.""

And in ""As You Like It"" (iii. 3) , Touchstone says, ""As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb, and the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires."" The object of these bells was to lead the falconer to the hawk when in a wood or out of sight. In Heywood's play entitled, ""A Woman Killed with Kindness,"" 1617, is a hawking scene, containing a striking allusion to the hawk's bells. The dress of the hawk consisted of a close-fitting hood of leather or velvet, enriched with needle-work, and surmounted with a tuft of coloured feathers, for use as well as ornament, inasmuch as they assisted the hand in removing the hood when the birds for the hawk's attack came in sight. Thus in ""Henry V."" (iii. 7), the Constable of France, referring to the valour of the Dauphin, says, ""’Tis a hooded valour, and when it appears it will bate."" 5 And again, in ""Romeo and Juliet"" (iii. 2), Juliet says—

""Hood my unmann’d blood, bating 6 in my cheeks.""

The ""jesses"" were two short straps of leather or silk, which were fastened to each leg of a hawk, to which was attached a swivel from which depended the leash or strap which the falconer 1 twisted round his hand. Othello (iii. 3), says

""Though that her jesses were my dear heart-strings.""

We find several allusions to the training of hawks. They were usually trained by being kept from sleep, it having been customary for the falconers to sit up by turns and ""watch"" the hawk, and keep it from sleeping, sometimes for three successive nights. Desdemona in ""Othello"" (iii. 3), says—

""My lord shall never rest;
I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;
His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;
I'll intermingle every thing he does
With Cassio's suit.""

So in Cartwright's ""Lady Errant"" (ii. 2),—

""We'll keep you as they do hawks,
Watching until you leave your wildness.""

In ""The Merry Wives of Windsor"" (v. 5), where Page says

""Nay, do not fly: I think we have watch’d you now""

the allusion is, says Staunton, to this method employed to tame or ""reclaim"" hawks.

Again, in ""Othello"" (iii. 3), 3 Iago exclaims—

""She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,
To seel her father's eyes up close as oak;""

in allusion to the practice of seeling a hawk, or sewing up its eyelids, by running a fine thread through them, in order to make her tractable and endure the hood of which we have already spoken. Henry IV. (""2 Henry IV."" iii. 1), in his soliloquy on sleep, says—

""Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast
Seal up the ship-boy's eyes, and rock his brains
In cradle of the rude imperious surge.""


In Spenser's ""Fairie Queen,"" (I. vii. 23), we read:—

""Mine eyes no more on vanity shall feed,
But sealed up with death, shall have their deadly meed.""
It was a common notion, that if a dove was let loose with its eyes so closed, it would fly straight upwards, continuing to mount, till it fell down through mere exhaustion.

In ""Cymbeline,"" (iii. 4), Imogen, referring to Posthumus, says:—

""I grieve myself
To think, when thou shall be disedged by her
That now thou tirest on,""

this passage containing two metaphorical expressions from falconry. A bird was said to be disedged when the keenness of its appetite was taken away by tiring, or feeding upon some tough or hard substance given to it for that purpose. In ""3 Henry VI."" (i. 1), the king says:—

""That hateful duke,
Whose haughty spirit, winged with desire,
Will cost my crown, and like an empty eagle
Tire on the flesh of me and of my son.""

In ""Timon of Athens,"" (iii. 6), one of the lords says:—

""Upon that were my thoughts tiring, when we encountered.""
In ""Venus and Adonis,"" too, we find a further allusion:—

""Even as an empty eagle, sharp by fast,
Tires with her beak on feathers, flesh, and bone,"" &c.

Among other allusions to the hawk, may be mentioned one in ""Measure for Measure,"" (iii. i):—

""This outward-sainted deputy,
Whose settled visage and deliberate word
Nips youth i’ th’ head and follies doth emmew,
As falcon doth the fowl.""

—the word ""emmew"" signifying the place where hawks were shut up during the time they moulted. In ""Romeo and Juliet,"" (iii. 4), Lady Capulet says of Juliet:—""To-night she is mew’d up to her heaviness;"" and in ""Taming of Shrew,"" (i. 1), Gremio speaking of Bianca to Signor Baptista, says:—""Why will you mew her?""



When the wing or tail feathers of a hawk were dropped, forced out, or broken, by any accident, it was usual to supply or repair as many as were deficient or damaged, an operation called ""to imp 1 a hawk."" Thus in Richard II. (ii. 1), Northumberland says:—

""If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke,
Imp out our drooping country's broken wing.""
So Massinger in his ""Renegado"" (v. 8), makes Asambeg say—

""Strive to imp
New feathers to the broken wings of time.""

Hawking was sometimes called birding. In the ""Merry Wives of Windsor,"" (iii. 3), Master Page says:—""I do invite you to-morrow morning to my house to breakfast; after, we'll a-birding together, I have a fine hawk for the bush."" In the same play (iii. 5), Dame Quickly, speaking of Mistress Ford, says:—""Her husband goes this morning a-birding;"" and Mistress Ford says (iv. 2):—""He's a-birding, sweet St John."" The word hawk, says Mr Harting, is invariably used by Shakspeare in its generic sense; and in only two instances does he allude to a particular species. These are the kestrel and sparrowhawk. In ""Twelfth Night,"" (ii. 5), Sir Toby Belch, speaking of Malvolio, as he finds the letter which Maria has purposely dropped in his path, says

""And with what wing the staniel checks at it.""

—staniel being a corruption of stangdall, a name for the kestrel hawk. ""Gouts"" is the technical term for the spots on some parts of the plumage of a hawk, and perhaps Shakspeare uses the word in allusion to a phrase in heraldry. Macbeth (ii. 1), speaking of the dagger, says:—""I see thee still, and on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood.""

Heron.—This bird was frequently flown at by falconers. Shakespeare, in ""Hamlet"" (ii. 2), makes Hamlet say, ""I am but mad north-north-west; when the wind is southerly, I know a hawk from a handsaw;"" handsaw being a corruption of ""heronshaw,"" or ""hernsew,"" which is still used, in the provincial dialects, for a heron. In Suffolk and Norfolk it is pronounced ""harnsa,"" from which to ""handsaw,"" is but a single step. Shakespeare here alludes to a proverbial saying, ""He knows not a hawk from a handsaw.""  Mr J. C. Heath explains the passage thus: ""The expression obviously refers to the sport of hawking. Most birds, especially one of heavy flight like the heron, when roused by the falconer or his dog, would fly down or with the wind, in order to escape. When the wind is from the north, the heron flies towards the south, and the spectator may be dazzled by the sun, and be unable to distinguish the hawk from the heron. On the other hand, when the wind is southerly, the heron flies towards the north, and it and the pursuing hawk are clearly seen by the sportsman, who then has his back to the sun, and without difficulty knows the hawk from the hernsew.""

Jay.—From its gay and gaudy plumage, this bird has been used for a loose woman, as ""Merry Wives of Windsor"" (iii. 3):—

""We'll teach him to know turtles from jays,""
i.e., to distinguish honest women from loose ones. Again, in ""Cymbeline"" (iii. 4), Imogen says—

""Some jay of Italy
Whose mother was her painting, hath betray’d him.""

Kestrel.—A hawk 5 of a base unserviceable breed, and therefore used by Spenser in his ""Faerie Queen"" (II. iii. 4), to signify base

""Ne thought of honour ever did assay
His baser breast, but in his kestrell kynd
A pleasant veine of glory he did fynd.""

By some it is derived from ""coystril,"" a knave or peasant, from being the hawk formerly used by persons of inferior rank. Thus, in ""Twelfth Night"" (i. 3), we find ""coystrill,"" and in ""Pericles"" (iv. 6), ""coystrel."" The name kestrel, says Singer, for an inferior kind of hawk, was evidently a corruption of the French quercelle or quercerelle, and originally had no connection with coystril, though in later times they may have been confounded. Holinshed 3 classes coisterels with lacqueys and women, the unwarlike attendants on an army. The term was also given as a nick-name to the emissaries employed by the kings of England in their French wars. Dyce also considers kestrel distinct from coistrel.

Kingfisher.—It was a common belief in days gone by, that during the days the halcyon or kingfisher was engaged in hatching her eggs, the sea remained so calm that the sailor might venture upon it without incurring risk of storm or tempest; hence this period was called by Pliny and Aristotle ""the halcyon days,"" to which allusion is made in ""1 Henry VI."" (i. 2)—

""Expect St Martin's summer, halcyon days.""
Dryden also refers to this notion—

""Amidst our arms as quiet you shall be,
As halcyons brooding on a winter's sea.""

Another superstition connected with this bird occurs in ""King Lear"" (ii. 1), where the Earl of Kent says—

""Turn their halcyon beaks
With every gale and vary of their masters.""

the prevalent idea being, that a dead kingfisher, suspended, from a cord, would always turn its beak in that direction from whence the wind blew. Marlow, in his ""Jew of Malta,"" (i. 1), says—

""But now how stands the wind?
Into what corner peers my halcyon's bill?""

Occasionally one may still see this bird hung up in cottages, a remnant, no doubt, of this old superstition.


Kite.—This bird was considered by the ancients to be unlucky. In ""Julius Cæsar"" (v. 1), Cassius says—

""Ravens, crows, and kites,
Fly o’er our heads and downward look on us.""

In ""Cymbeline,"" too (i. 2), Imogen says—

""I chose an eagle, and did avoid a puttock,""

puttock, here, being a synonym sometimes applied to the kite. Formerly the kite became a term of reproach from its ignoble habits. Thus in ""Antony and Cleopatra"" (iii. 13), Antony exclaims, ""You kite,"" and King Lear (i. 4), says to Goneril, ""detested kite, thou liest."" Its intractable disposition is alluded to in ""Taming of the Shrew"" by Petruchio (iv. 1). A curious peculiarity of this bird is noticed in ""Winter's Tale"" (iv. 3), where Autolycus says:—""My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to lesser linen""—meaning that his practice was to steal sheets; leaving the smaller linen to be carried away by the kites, who will occasionally carry it off to line their nests. Mr Dyce quotes the following remarks of Mr Peck on this passage—""Autolycus here gives us to understand that he is a thief of the first class. This he explains by an allusion to an odd vulgar notion. The common people many of them, think that, if anyone can find a kite's nest, when she hath young, before they are fledged, and sew up their back doors, so as they cannot mute, the mother kite in compassion to their distress, will steal lesser linen, as caps, cravats, ruffles, or any other such small matters as she can best fly with, from off the hedges where they are hanged to dry after washing, and carry them to her nest, and there leave them, if possible to move the pity of the first corner, to cut the thread, and ease them of their misery.""

Lapwing.—Several interesting allusions are made by Shakespeare to this eccentric bird. It was a common notion that the young lapwings ran out of the shell with part of it sticking on their heads, in such haste were they to be hatched. Horatio (""Hamlet,"" v. 2) says of Osric—

""This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.""


It was, therefore, regarded as the symbol of a forward fellow. Webster in the ""White Devil"" (1859, p. 13)—

""Forward lapwing!
He flies with the shell on’s head.""

The lapwing, like the partridge, is also said to draw pursuers from her nest by fluttering along the ground in an opposite direction or by crying in other places. Thus in the ""Comedy of Errors"" (iv. 2), Shakespeare says—

""Far from her nest the lapwing cries away.""

Again in ""Measure for Measure"" (i. 4), Lucio exclaims—

""Though ’tis my familiar sin,
With maids to seem the lapwing, and to jest
Tongue far from heart.""

Once more in ""Much Ado about Nothing"" (iii. 1) we read—

""For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs,
Close by the ground, to hear our conference.""

Several, too, of our older poets refer to this peculiarity. In Ben Jonson's ""Underwoods"" (lviii.) we are told—

""Where he that knows will like a lapwing fly,
Farre from the nest, and so himself belie.""

Through thus alluring intruders from its nest, the lapwing became a symbol of insincerity; and hence originated the proverb, ""The lapwing cries tongue from heart;"" or, ""The lapwing cries most, farthest from her nest.""

Lark.—Shakespeare has bequeathed to us many exquisite passages referring to the lark, full of the most sublime pathos and lofty conceptions. Most readers are doubtless acquainted with that superb song in ""Cymbeline"" (ii. 3), where this sweet songster is represented as singing ""at heaven's gate;"" and again, as the ""bird of dawn,"" it is described in ""Venus and Adonis,"" thus—

""Lo, here the gentle lark, weary of rest,
From his moist cabinet mounts up on high,
And wakes the morning, from whose silver breast
The sun ariseth in his majesty.""

In ""Love's Labour's Lost"" (v. 2 song), we have a graphic touch of pastoral life—

""When shepherds pipe on oaten straws
And merry larks are ploughmen's clocks.""

The words of Portia, too, in ""Merchant of Venice"" (v. 1), to sing ""as sweetly as the lark,"" have long ago passed into a proverb.

It was formerly a current saying that the lark and toad changed eyes, to which Juliet refers in ""Romeo and Juliet"" (iii. 5)—

""Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes.""

Warburton says this popular fancy originated in the toad having very fine eyes, and the lark very ugly ones. This tradition was formerly expressed in a rustic rhyme—

""To heav’n I’d fly,
But that the toad beguil’d me of mine eye.""

In ""Henry VIII."" (iii. 2), the Earl of Surrey, in denouncing Wolsey, alludes to a curious method of capturing larks, which was effected by small mirrors and red cloth. These scaring the birds made them crouch, while the fowler drew his nets over them—

""Let his grace go forward,
And dare us with his cap like larks.""

In this case the cap was the scarlet hat of the cardinal, which it was intended to use as a piece of red cloth. The same idea occurs in Skelton's ""Why Come Ye not to Court?"" a satire on Wolsey—

""The red hat with his lure
Bringeth all things under cure.""

The words ""tirra-lyra"" (""Winter's Tale,"" iv. 3), are a fanciful combination of sounds, meant to imitate the lark's note, borrowed, says Nares, from the French tire-lire. Browne, ""British Pastorals"" (bk. i. song 4), makes it teery-leery. In one of the Coventry pageants there is the following old song sung by the shepherds at the birth of Christ, which contains the expression—

""As I out rode this endenes night,
Of three joli shepherds I sawe a syght,
And all aboute there fold a stare shone bright,
They sang terli terlow,
So mereli the sheppards their pipes can blow.""

In Scotland and the north of England, the peasantry say that if one is desirous of knowing what the lark says, he must lie down on his back in the field and listen, and he will then hear it say:—

""Up in the lift go we,
Tehee, tehee, tehee, tehee!
There's not a shoemaker on the earth
Can make a shoe to me, to me!
Why so, why so, why so?
Because my heel is as long as my toe.""

Magpie.—It was formerly known as magot-pie, probably from the French magot, a monkey, because the bird chatters and plays droll tricks like a monkey. It has generally been regarded as a mysterious bird, and regarded with superstitious awe, and is thus alluded to in ""Macbeth,"" (iii. 4):—

""Augurs and understood relations, have
By magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth
The secret’st man of blood.""
And again, in 3 ""Henry VI.,"" (v. 6), it is said:—

""Chattering pies in dismal discords sung.""
There are numerous rhymes relating to the magpie, of which we subjoin as a specimen one prevalent in the north of England:—

""One is sorrow, two mirth,
Three a wedding, four a birth.
Five heaven, six hell,
Seven the de’il's ain sell.""

In Devonshire, in order to avert the ill-luck from seeing a magpie, the peasant spits over his right shoulder three times, and in Yorkshire various charms are in use. One is to raise the hat as a salutation, and then to sign the cross on the breast; and another consists in making the same sign by crossing the thumbs. It is a common notion in Scotland that magpies flying near the windows of a house portend a speedy death to one of its inmates. The superstitions associated with the magpie are not confined to this country, for in Sweden 1 it is considered the witch's bird, belonging to the evil one and the other powers of night. In Denmark, when a magpie perches on a house, it is regarded as a sign that strangers are coming.

Martin.—The martin, or martlet, which is called in ""Macbeth,"" (i. 6), the ""guest of summer,"" as being a migratory bird, has been from the earliest times treated with superstitious respect,—it being considered unlucky to molest or in any way injure its nest. Thus, in the ""Merchant of Venice,"" (ii. 9), the Prince of Arragon says:—

""The martlet
Builds in the weather on the outward wall,
Even in the force and road of casualty.""

Forster says that the circumstance of this bird's nest being built so close to the habitations of man indicates that it has long enjoyed freedom from molestation. There is a popular rhyme still current in the north of England:—

""The martin and the swallow
Are God Almighty's bow and arrow.""
The Nightingale.—The popular error that the nightingale sings with its breast impaled upon a thorn is noticed by Shakespeare, who makes Lucreece say:—

""And whiles against a thorn thou bear’st thy part,
To keep thy sharp woes waking.""
In the ""Passionate Pilgrim,"" (xxi.), there is an allusion:—

""Everything did banish moan,
Save the nightingale alone.
She, poor bird, as all forlorn,
Lean’d her breast up-till a thorn,
And there sung the dolefull’st ditty,
That to hear it was great pity.""
Beaumont and Fletcher, in ""The Faithful Shepherdess"" (v. 3), speak of—

""The nightingale among the thick-leaved spring,
That sits alone in sorrow, and doth sing
Whole nights away in mourning.""

Sir Thomas Browne asks ""Whether the nightingale's sitting with her breast against a thorn, be any more than that she placeth some prickles on the outside of her nest, or roosteth in thorny prickly places, where serpents may least approach her."" In the ""Zoologist"" for 1862 the Rev. A. C. Smith mentions ""the discovery, on two occasions, of a strong thorn projecting upwards in the centre of the nightingale's nest."" Another notion is that the nightingale never sings by day; and thus Portia in ""Merchant of Venice,"" (v. 1), says:—

""I think,
The nightingale, if she could sing by day,
When every goose is cackling, would be thought
No better a musician than the wren.""

Such, however, is not the case, for this bird often sings as sweetly in the day as at night-time. There is an old superstition 3 that the nightingale sings all night, to keep itself awake, lest the glow-worm should devour her. The classical fable of the unhappy Philomela turned into a nightingale, when her sister Progne was changed to a swallow, has doubtless given rise to this bird being spoken of as she; thus Juliet tells Romeo (iii. 5),—

""It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree;
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.""

Sometimes the nightingale is termed Philomel, as in ""Midsummer Night's Dream"" (ii. 2, song) 1—

""Philomel, with melody,
Sing your sweet lullaby.""

Osprey.—This bird, also called the sea-eagle, besides having a destructive power of devouring fish, was supposed formerly to have a fascinating influence, both which qualities are alluded to in the following passage in ""Coriolanus"" (iv. 7)—

""I think he'll be to Rome,
As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it
By sovereignty of nature.""

Drayton, in his ""Polyolbion"" (Song xxv.), mentions the same fascinating power of the osprey—

""The osprey, oft here seen, though seldom here it breeds,
Which over them the fish no sooner do espy,
But, betwixt him and them by an antipathy,
Turning their bellies up, as though their death they saw,
They at his pleasure lie, to stuff his gluttonous maw.""

Ostrich.—The extraordinary digestion of this bird is said to be shown by its swallowing iron and other hard substances. In 2 Henry VI. (iv. 10), the rebel Cade says to Alexander Iden—""Ah villain, thou wilt betray me, and get a thousand crowns of the .king by carrying my head to him; but I'll make thee eat iron like an ostrich, and swallow my sword like a great pin, ere thou and I part."" Cuvier, speaking of this bird, says, ""It is yet so voracious, and its senses of taste and smell are so obtuse, that it devours animal and mineral substances indiscriminately, until its enormous stomach is completely full. It swallows without any choice, and merely as it were to serve for ballast, wood, stones, grass, iron, copper, gold, lime, or, in fact, any other substance equally hard, indigestible, and deleterious."" Sir Thomas Browne, writing on this subject, says, ""The ground of this conceit in its swallowing down fragments of iron, which men observing, by a forward illation, have therefore conceived it digesteth them, which is an inference, not to be admitted, as being a fallacy of the consequent."" In Loudon's ""Magazine of Natural History"" (No. 6, p. 32), we are told of an ostrich having been killed by swallowing glass.

Owl.—The dread attached to this unfortunate bird is frequently spoken of by Shakespeare, who has alluded to several of the superstitions associated with it. At the outset, many of the epithets ascribed to it show the prejudice with which it was regarded—being in various places stigmatised as ""the vile owl,"" in ""Troilus and Cressida"" (ii. 1); and the ""obscure bird,"" in ""Macbeth"" (ii. 3), etc. From the earliest period it has been considered a bird of ill-omen, and Pliny tells us how, on one occasion, even Rome itself underwent a lustration, because one of them strayed into the Capitol. He represents it also as a funereal bird, a monster of the night, the very abomination of human kind. Virgil describes its death-howl from the top of the temple by night, a circumstance introduced as a precursor of Dido's death. Ovid, too, constantly speaks of this bird's presence as an evil omen; and indeed the same notions respecting it may be found among the writings of most of the ancient poets. This superstitious awe in which the owl is held may be owing to its peculiar look, its occasional and uncertain appearance, its loud and dismal cry, as well as to its being the bird of night. 5 It has generally been associated with calamities and deeds of darkness. 6 Thus its weird shriek pierces the ear of Lady Macbeth (ii. 2), while the murder is being committed—

""Hark!—Peace!
It was the owl that shriek’d, the fatal bellman,
Which gives the stern’st good night.""

And when the murderer rushes in exclaiming—

""I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?""
She answers—

""I heard the owl scream.""

Its appearance at a birth has been said to foretell ill-luck to the infant, a superstition to which King Henry, in ""3 Henry VI."" (v. 6), addressing Gloucester, refers—

""The owl shriek’d at thy birth, an evil sign.""

Its cries 1 have been supposed to presage death, and, to quote the words of the ""Spectator,"" ""a screech-owl at mid: night has alarmed a family more than a band of robbers."" Thus, in ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" (v. 1), we are told how—

""The screech-owl, screeching loud,
Puts the wretch that lies in woe
In remembrance of a shroud"";

and, in ""1 Henry VI."" (iv. 2), it is called the ""ominous and fearful hour of death."" Again, when Richard III. (iv. 4) is exasperated by the bad news, he interrupts the third messenger by saying—

""Out on you, owls! nothing but songs of death?""
The owl by day is considered by some equally ominous, as in ""3 Henry VI."" (v. 4) 1—

""The owl by day,
If he arise, is mock’d and wonder’d at.""
And in ""Julius Cæsar"" (i. 3), Casca says,—

""And yesterday the bird of night did sit
Even at noon-day, upon the market-place,
Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies
Do so conjointly meet, let not men say,
These are their reasons,—they are natural';
For, I believe they are portentous things
Unto the climate that they point upon.""

Considering, however, the abhorrence with which the owl is generally regarded, it is not surprising that the ""owlet's wing"" should form an ingredient of the cauldron in which the witches in ""Macbeth"" (iv. 1), prepared their ""charm of powerful trouble."" The owl is, too, in all probability, represented by Shakespeare as a witch, 1 a companion of the fairies in their moonlight gambols. In ""Comedy of Errors"" (ii. 2), Dromio of Syracuse says—

""This is the fairy land: O, spite of spites!
We talk with goblins, owls, and elvish sprites.
If we obey them not, this will ensue,
They'll suck our breath, and pinch us black and blue!""

Singer in his Notes on this passage (ii. p. 28) says—""It has been asked, how should Shakespeare know that screech-owls were considered by the Romans as witches?"" Do these cavillers think that Shakespeare never looked into a book? Take an extract from the Cambridge Latin Dictionary (1594, 8vo), probably the very book he used: ""Strix, a scritche owle; an unluckie kind of bird (as they of olde time said) which sucked out the blood of infants lying in their cradles; a witch, that changeth the favour of children; an hagge or fairie."" So in the ""London Prodigal,"" a comedy, 1605:—""Soul, I think I am sure crossed or witch’d with an owl."" In the ""Tempest"" (v. 1), Shakespeare introduces Ariel as saying—

""Where the bee sucks, there suck I,
In a cowslip's bell I lie,
There I couch when owls do cry.""

Ariel, who sucks honey for luxury in the cowslip's bell, retreats thither for quiet when owls are abroad and screeching. According to an old legend, the owl was originally a baker's daughter, to which allusion is made in ""Hamlet"" (iv. 5), where Ophelia exclaims—""They say the owl was a baker's daughter. Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be."" Douce says the following story was current among the Gloucestershire peasantry:—""Our Saviour went into a baker's shop where they were baking, and asked for some bread to eat; the mistress of the shop immediately put a piece of dough into the oven to bake for him; but was reprimanded by her daughter, who, insisting that the piece of dough was too large, reduced it to a very small size; the dough, however, immediately began to swell, and presently became a most enormous size, whereupon the baker's daughter cried out, 'Heugh, heugh, heugh!' which owl-like noise probably induced our Saviour to transform her into that bird for her wickedness."" Another version of the same story, as formerly known in Herefordshire, substitutes a fairy in the place of our Saviour. Similar legends are found on the Continent.

Parrot.—The ""popinjay,"" in ""1 Henry IV."" (i. 3), is another name for the parrot—from the Spanish, papagayo—a term which occurs in Browne's ""Pastorals"" (ii. 65)—

""Or like the mixture nature dothe display
Upon the quaint wings of the popinjay.""

Its supposed restlessness before rain is referred to in ""As you like it,"" (iv. 1):—""More clamorous than a parrot against rain."" It was formerly customary to teach the parrot unlucky words, with which when anyone was offended, it was the standing joke of the wise owner to say, ""Take heed, sir, my parrot prophesies,""—an allusion to which custom we find in ""Comedy of Errors,"" (iv. 4), where Dromio of Ephesus says:—""Prophesy like the parrot, beware the rope's end."" To this Butler hints, where speaking of Ralpho's skill in augury, he says 2:—

""Could tell what subtlest parrots mean,
That speak and think contrary clean;
What member ’tis of whom they talk,
When they cry rope, and walk, knave walk.""

The rewards given to parrots to encourage them to speak are mentioned in ""Troilus and Cressida,"" (v. 2) 3—""The parrot will not do more for an almond."" Hence, a proverb for the greatest temptation that could be put before a man

p. 135

seems to have been ""An almond for a parrot."" To ""talk like a parrot,"" is a common proverb, a sense in which it occurs in ""Othello,"" (ii. 3).

Peacock.—This bird was as proverbially used for a proud, vain fool as the lapwing for a silly one. In this sense some would understand it in the much disputed passage in ""Hamlet,"" (iii. 2):—

""For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
This realm dismantled was
Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
A very, very—peacock.""

The third and fourth folios reads pajock, the other editions have ""paiock,"" ""paiocke,"" or ""pajocke,"" and in the later quartos the word was changed to ""paicock"" and ""pecock,"" whence Pope printed peacock.

Dyce says that in Scotland the peacock is called the pea-jock. Some have proposed to read paddock, and in the last scene Hamlet bestows this opprobrious name upon the king. It has been also suggested to read puttock, a kite.  The peacock has also been regarded as the emblem of pride and arrogance, as in 1 ""Henry VI."" (iii. 3) 4:—

""Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while,
And, like a peacock, sweep along his tail;
We'll pull his plumes and take away his train.""

Pelican.—There are several allusions by Shakespeare to the pelican's piercing her own breast to feed her young. Thus, in Hamlet (iv. 5), Laertes says:—

""To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;
And like the kind life-rendering pelican,
Repast them with my blood.""

And in ""King Lear,"" where the young pelicans are represented as piercing their mother's breast to drink her blood, an illustration of filial impiety (iii. 4), the king says:—

""Is it the fashion, that discarded fathers
Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?
Judicious punishment! ’Twas this flesh begot
Those pelican daughters.""

It is a common notion that the fable here alluded to is a classical one, but this is an error. Shakespeare, says Mr Harting, ""was content to accept the story as he found it, and to apply it metaphorically as the occasion required."" Mr Houghton, in an interesting letter to ""Land and Water "" on this subject, remarks that the Egyptians believed in a bird feeding its young with its blood, and this bird is none other than the vulture. He goes on to say that the fable of the pelican doubtless originated in the Patristic annotations on the scriptures. The ecclesiastical Fathers transferred the Egyptian story from the vulture to the pelican, but magnified the story a hundredfold, for the blood of the parent was not only supposed to serve as food for the young, but was also able to reanimate the dead offspring. Augustine, commenting on Psalm cii. 6,—""I am like a pelican of the wilderness,""—remarks:—""These birds [male pelicans] are said to kill their offspring by blows of their beaks, and then to bewail their death for the space of three days. At length, however, it is said that the mother inflicts a severe wound on herself, pouring the flowing blood over the dead young ones, which instantly brings them to life."" To the same effect write Eustathius, Isidorus, Epiphanius, and a host of other writers.

According to another idea pelicans are hatched dead, but the cock pelican then wounds his breast, and lets one drop of blood fall upon each, and this quickens them.


Pheasant.—This bird is only once alluded to in ""Winter's Tale"" (iv. 4), where the Clown jokingly says to the Shepherd—""Advocate's the Court word for a pheasant; say you have none.""

Phœnix.—Many allusions are given to this fabulous bird which is said to rise again from its own ashes. Thus in ""Henry VIII."" (v. 4), Cranmer tells how—

""When
The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phœnix,
Her ashes new create another heir,
As great in admiration as herself.""

Again, in ""3 Henry VI."" (i. 4), the Duke of York exclaims—

""My ashes, as the phœnix, may bring forth
A bird that will revenge upon you all.""

Once more, in ""Henry VI."" (iv. 7), Sir William Lucy speaking of Talbot and those slain with him, predicts that ""from their ashes shall be rear’d a phœnix that shall make all France afeard.""

Sir Thomas Browne tells us that there is but one phœnix in the world, ""which after many hundred years burns herself, and from the ashes thereof ariseth up another."" From the very earliest times there have been countless traditions respecting this wonderful bird. Thus its longevity has been estimated from three hundred to fifteen hundred years; and among the various localities assigned as its home are Ethiopia, Arabia, Egypt, and India. In the ""Phœnix and the Turtle,"" it is said—

""Let the bird of loudest lay
On the sole Arabian tree,
Herald sad and trumpet be.""

Pliny says of this bird, ""Howbeit, I cannot tell what to make of him; and first of all, whether it be a tale or no, that there is never but one of them in the whole world, and the same not commonly seen."" Malone 3 quotes from Lyly's ""Euphues and his England"" (p. 312, ed. Arber). ""For as there is but one phœnix in the world, so is there but one tree in Arabia wherein she buyldeth;"" and Florio's ""New Worlde of Wordes"" (1598), ""Rasin, a tree in Arabia, whereof there is but one found, and upon it the phœnix sits.""

Pigeon.—As carriers these birds have been used from a very early date, and the castle of the birds at Bagdad takes its name from the pigeon-post which the old monks of the convent established. The building has crumbled into ruins long ago by the lapse of time, but the bird messengers of Bagdad became celebrated as far westward as Greece, and were a regular commercial institution between the distant parts of Asia Minor, Arabia, and the east. In ancient Egypt also the carrier breed was brought to great perfection, and, between the cities of the Nile and the Red Sea, the old traders used to send word of their caravans to each other by letters written on silk, and tied under the wings of trained doves. In ""Titus Andronicus"" (iv. 3), Titus, on seeing a clown enter with two pigeons, says—""News, news from heaven! Marcus, the post is come. Sirrah, What tidings? have you any letters?"" From the same play we also learn that it was also customary to give a pair of pigeons as a present. The Clown says to Saturninus (iv. 4), ""I have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here.""

In ""Romeo and Juliet"" (i. 3), the dove is used synonymously for pigeon; where the nurse is represented as ""sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall."" 3* Mr Darwin in his ""Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication"" (i. pp. 204, 205), has shown that from the very earliest times pigeons have been kept in a domesticated state. He says—""The earliest record of pigeons in a domesticated condition occurs in the 5th Egyptian dynasty, about 3000 B.C., but Mr Birch of the British Museum informs me that the pigeon appears in a bill of fare in the previous dynasty. Domestic pigeons are mentioned in ""Genesis,"" ""Leviticus,"" and ""Isaiah."" Pliny informs us that the Romans gave immense prices for pigeons; 'nay, they are come to this pass, that they can reckon up their pedigree and race.' In India, about the year 1600 pigeons were much valued by Akber Khan; 20,000 birds were carried about with the Court."" In most countries, too, the breeding and taming of pigeons have been a favourite recreation. The constancy of the pigeon has been proverbial from time immemorial; allusions to which occur in ""Winter's Tale"" (iv. 3); and in ""As You Like it"" (iii. 3).

Quail.—The quail was thought to be an amorous bird; and hence was metaphorically used to denote people of a loose character. In this sense it is generally understood in ""Troilus and Cressida"" (v. 1), ""Here's Agamemnon, an honest fellow enough, and one that loves quails."" Mr Harting, however, thinks that the passage just quoted refers to the practice formerly prevalent of keeping quails, and making them fight like game-cocks. The context of the passage would seem to sanction the former meaning. Quail fighting is spoken of in ""Antony and Cleopatra"" (ii. 3), where Antony, speaking of the superiority of Cæsar's fortunes to his own, says—

""If we draw lots, he speeds;
His cocks do win the battle still of mine,
When it is all to nought; and his quails ever
Beat mine, inhoop’d, at odds.""

It appears that cocks as well as quails were sometimes made to fight within a broad hoop—hence the term inhoop’d—to keep them from quitting each other. Quail-fights were well known among the ancients, and especially at Athens. Julius Pollux relates that a circle was made, in which the birds were placed, and he whose quail was driven out of this circle lost the stake, which was sometimes money, and occasionally the quails themselves. Another practice was to produce one of these birds, which being first smitten with the middle finger, a feather was then plucked from its head. If the quail bore this operation without flinching, his master gained the stake, but lost it if he ran away. Some doubt exists as to whether quail-fighting prevailed in the time of Shakespeare. At the present day 1 the Sumatrans practise these quail combats, and this pastime is common in some parts of Italy, and also in China. Mr Douce has given a curious print, from an elegant Chinese miniature painting, which represents some ladies engaged at this amusement, where the quails are actually inhooped.

Raven.—Perhaps no bird is so universally unpopular as the raven, its hoarse croak in most countries being regarded as ominous. Hence, as might be expected, Shakespeare often refers to it, in order to make the scene he depicts all the more vivid and graphic. In ""Titus Andronicus"" (ii. 3), Tamora, describing ""a barren detested vale,"" says—

""The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,
O’ercome with moss and baleful mistletoe:
Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,
Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven.""

And in ""Julius Cæsar"" (v. 1), Cassius tells us how ravens

""Fly o’er our heads and downward look on us,
As we were sickly prey.""

It seems that the superstitious dread  attaching to this bird has chiefly arisen from its supposed longevity, and its frequent mention and agency in Holy Writ. By the Romans it was consecrated to Apollo, and was believed to have a prophetic knowledge—a notion still very prevalent. Thus its supposed faculty of ""smelling death"" still renders its presence, or even its voice, ominous. Othello (iv. i) exclaims—

""O, it comes o’er my memory,
As doth the raven o’er the infected house,
Boding to all.""

There is no doubt a reference here to the fanciful notion that it was a constant attendant on a house infected with the plague. Most readers, too, are familiar with that famous passage in ""Macbeth"" (i. 5), where Lady Macbeth, having heard of the king's intention to stay at the castle, exclaims—

""The raven himself is hoarse
That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
Under my battlements. Come, you spirits
That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,
And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full
Of direst cruelty!""

We may compare Spenser's language in the ""Faerie Queene"" (bk. ii., c. vii. 23)

""After him owles and night ravens flew,
The hateful messengers of heavy things,
Of death and dolor telling sad tidings.""

And once more the following passage from Drayton's ""Barons’ Wars"" (book v. st. 42), illustrates the same idea—

""The ominous raven often he doth hear,
Whose croaking him of following horror tells.""

In ""Much Ado About Nothing"" (ii. 3), the ""night-raven"" is mentioned. Benedick observes to himself—""I had as lief have heard the night-raven, come what plague could have come after it."" This inauspicious bird, according to Steevens, is the owl; but this conjecture is evidently wrong, ""being  at variance with sundry passages in our early writers, who make a distinction between it and the night-raven.""

Thus Johnson, in his ""Seven Champions of Christendom"" (part i), speaks of ""the dismal cry of night-ravens, . . . . and the fearefull sound of schriek owles."" Cotgrave regarded the ""night-crow"" and the ""night-raven"" as synonymous; and Mr Yarrell considered them only different names for the night-heron.  In ""3 Henry VI."" (v. 6), King Henry says—

""The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time.""

Goldsmith, in his ""Animated Nature,"" calls the bittern the night-raven, and says—""I remember, in the place where I was a boy, with what terror the bird's note affected the whole village; they consider it as the presage of some sad event, and generally found, or made one to succeed it. If any person in the neighbourhood died, they supposed it could not be otherwise, for the night-raven had foretold it; but if nobody happened to die, the death of a cow or a sheep gave completion to the prophecy.""

According to an old belief, the raven deserts its own young, to which Shakespeare alludes in ""Titus Andronicus"" (ii. 3)—

""Some say that ravens foster forlorn children,
The whilst their own birds famish in their nests.""
""It was supposed that when the raven,"" says Mr Harting, ""saw its young ones newly hatched, and covered with down, it conceived such an aversion that it forsook them, and did not return to the nest until a darker plumage had shown itself."" To this belief the commentators consider the Psalmist refers, when he says—""He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry"" (Psalm cxlvii. 9). We are told, too, in Job, ""Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat"" (Job xxxviii. 41). Shakespeare, in ""As You Like It"" (ii. 3), probably had the words of the Psalmist in his mind—

""He that doth the ravens feed
Yea, providently caters for the sparrow.""

The raven has from earliest times been symbolical of blackness, both in connection with colour and character. In ""Romeo and Juliet"" (iii. 2), Juliet exclaims—

""O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face,
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
Dove-feather’d raven!""

Once more, ravens’ feathers were formerly used by witches, from an old superstition that the wings of this bird carried with them contagion wherever they went. Hence in the ""Tempest"" (i. 2), Caliban says

""As wicked dew as e’er my mother brush’d
With raven's feather from unwholesome fen
Drop on you both.""

Robin Redbreast.—According to a pretty notion, 1 this little bird is said to cover with leaves any dead body it may chance to find unburied; a belief which probably in a great measure originated in the well-known ballad of the ""Children in the Wood,"" although it seems to have been known previously. Thus Singer quotes as follows from ""Cornucopia, or Divers Secrets,"" &c. (by Thomas Johnson, 1596)—""The robin redbreast, if he finds a man or woman dead, will cover all his face with moss; and some think that if the body should remain unburied that he would cover the whole body also."" In Dekker's ""Villaines Discovered by Lanthorn and Candlelight"" (1616), quoted by Douce, it is said—""They that cheere up a prisoner but with their sight, are robin redbreasts that bring strawes in their bills to cover a dead man in extremitie."" Shakespeare, in a beautiful passage in ""Cymbeline"" (iv. 2), thus touchingly alludes to it, making Arviragus, when addressing the supposed dead body of Imogen, say—

""With fairest flowers
While summer lasts, and I live here, Fidele,
I'll sweeten thy sad grave: thou shalt not lack
The flower that like's thy face, pale primrose, nor
The azured harebell, like thy veins; no, nor
The leaf of Eglantine, whom not to slander
Out-sweeten’d not thy breath: the ruddock would,
With charitable bill,—o bill, sore shaming
Those rich-left heirs that let their fathers lie
Without a monument! bring thee all this;
Yea, and furr’d moss besides, when flowers are none,
To winter-ground thy corse.""
the ""ruddock"" being one of the old names for the redbreast,

which is now-a-days found in some localities. John Webster, also, refers to the same idea in ""The White Devil"" (1857. Edit. Dyce, p. 45),—

""Call for the robin redbreast and the wren,
Since o’er shady groves they hover,
And with leaves and flowers do cover
The friendless bodies of unburied men.""

Drayton, too, in the ""Owl,"" has the following lines:

""Cov’ring with moss the dead's unclosed eye,
The little redbreast teaching charitie.""

Rook.—As an ominous bird this is mentioned in ""Macbeth,"" (iii. 4). Formerly the nobles of England prided themselves in having a rookery in the neighbourhood of their castles, because rooks were regarded as ""fowls of good omen."" On this account no one was permitted to kill them, under severe penalties. When rooks desert a rookery 2 it is said to foretell the downfall of the family on whose property it is. A Northumbrian saying informs us that the rooks left the rookery of Chipchase before the family of Reed left that place. There is also a notion that when rooks haunt a town or village ""mortality is supposed to await its inhabitants, and if they feed in the street it shows that a storm is at hand.""

The expression ""bully-rook,"" in ""Merry Wives of Windsor,"" (I. 3), in Shakespeare's time, says Mr Harting, 4 had the same meaning as ""jolly-dog"" now-a-days; but subsequently it became a term of reproach, meaning a cheating sharper. It has been suggested that the term derives its origin from the rook in the game of chess; but Douce 5 considers it very improbable that this noble game, ""never the amusement of gamblers, should have been ransacked on this occasion.""

Snipe.—This bird was in Shakespeare's time proverbial for a foolish man. 1 In ""Othello,"" (1. 3), Iago, speaking of Roderigo, says:—

""For I mine own gain’d knowledge should profane,
If I would time expend with such a snipe,
But for my sport and profit.""

Sparrow.—A popular name for the common sparrow was, and still is, philip, perhaps from its note, ""Phip, phip."" Hence the allusion to a person named Philip in ""King John,"" (i. 1):—

Gurney, Good leave, good Philip.
Bastard, Philip!—sparrow.

Staunton says perhaps Catullus alludes to this expression in the following lines:—

""Sed circumsiliens, modo huc, modo illuc,
Ad solam dominam usque pipilabat.""

Skelton, in an elegy upon a sparrow, calls it ""Phyllyp Sparowe""; and Gascoigne also writes ""The praise of Philip Sparrow.""

In ""Measure for Measure,"" (iii. 2), Lucio, speaking of Angelo, the Deputy-Duke of Vienna, says:—""Sparrows must not build in his house-eaves, because they are lecherous.""

Sparrow-hawk.—A name formerly given to a young sparrow hawk was eyas-musket, 3 a term we find in ""Merry Wives of Windsor,"" (iii. 3):—

""How now, my-eyas-musket!
What news with you?""

It was thus metaphorically used as a jocular phrase for a small child. As the invention, too, of fire-arms took place at a time when hawking was in high fashion, some of the new weapons were named after those birds, probably from the idea of their fetching their prey from on high. Musket has thus become the established name for one sort of gun. Some, however, assert that the musket was invented in the fifteenth century, and owes its name to its inventors.

Starling.—This was one of the birds that was in days gone by trained to speak. In ""1 Henry IV."" (i. 3), Hotspur says—

""I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak
Nothing but 'Mortimer,' and give it him,
To keep his anger still in motion.""

Pliny tells us how starlings were taught to utter both Latin and Greek words for the amusement of the young Cæsars; and there are numerous instances on record of the clever sentences uttered by this amusing bird.

Swallow.—This bird has generally been honoured as the harbinger of spring, and Athenæus relates that the Rhodians had a solemn song to welcome it. Anacreon has a well known ode. Shakespeare in the ""Winter's Tale"" (iv. 3), alludes to the time of the swallow's appearance in the following passage—

""Daffodils,
That come before the swallow dares, and take
The winds of March with beauty.""

And its departure is mentioned in ""Timon of Athens"" (iii. 6), ""The swallow follows not summer more willing than we your lordship.""

We may compare Tennyson's notice of the bird's approach and migration in the ""May Queen""—

""And the swallow ’ll come back again with summer o’er the wave.""

It has been long considered lucky for the swallow to build its nest on the roof of a house, but just as unlucky for it to forsake a place which it has once tenanted. Shakespeare probably had this superstition in his mind when he represents Scarus as saying, in ""Antony and Cleopatra"" (iv. 12)—

""Swallows have built
In Cleopatra's sails their nests: the augurers
Say they know not,—they cannot tell;—look grimly,
And dare not speak their knowledge.""


Swan.—According to a romantic notion, dating from antiquity, the swan is said to sing sweetly just before its death, many pretty allusions to which we find scattered here and there throughout Shakespeare's plays. In ""Merchant of Venice"" (iii. 2), Portia says—

""He makes a swan-like end,
Fading in music.""

Emilia, too, in ""Othello"" (v. 2), just before she dies, exclaims—

""I will play the swan,
And die in music.""

In ""King John"" (v. 7), Prince Henry, at his father's deathbed, thus pathetically speaks—

""’Tis strange that death should sing.
I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan,
Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death,
And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings
His soul and body to their lasting rest.""

Again, in ""Lucrece"" (1611), we have these touching lines—

""And now this pale swan in her watery nest,
Begins the sad dirge of her certain ending.""
And once more in ""Phœnix and the Turtle""—

""Let the priest in surplice white,
That defunctive music can,
Be the death-divining swan,
Lest the requiem lack his right.""

This superstition, says Douce, ""was credited by Plato, Chrysippus, Aristotle, Euripides, Philostratus, Cicero, Seneca, and Martial. Pliny, Ælian, and Athenæus, among the ancients, and Sir Thomas More, among the moderns, treat this opinion as a vulgar error. Luther believed in it."" This notion probably originated in the swan being identified with Orpheus. Sir Thomas Browne says we read that, ""after his death Orpheus the musician became a swan. Thus was it the bird of Apollo, the bird of music by the Greeks."" Alluding to this piece of folk-lore, Carl Engel remarks:—""Although our common swan does not produce sounds which might account for this tradition, it is a well-known fact that the wild swan (Cygnus ferus), also called the 'whistling swan,' when on the wing emits a shrill tone, which, however harsh it may sound if heard near, produces a pleasant effect when, emanating from a large flock high in the air, it is heard in a variety of pitches of sound, increasing or diminishing in loudness according to the movement of the birds and to the current of the air."" Colonel Hawker 2 says, ""The only note which I ever heard the wild swan make, in winter, is his well-known 'whoop.'""

Tassel-Gentle. —The male of the Goshawk was so called on account of its tractable disposition, and the facility with which it was tamed. It occurs in ""Romeo and Juliet"" (ii. 2)—

""O, for a falconer's voice
To lure this tassel-gentle back again!""

Spenser, in his ""Faerie Queene"" (Bk. iii., iv. 49), says—

""Having far off espied a tassel-gent
Which after her his nimble wings doth straine.""

This species of hawk was also commonly called a ""falcon-gentle;"" on account of ""her familiar, courteous, disposition.""

Turkey.—This bird, so popular with us at Christmas-tide, is mentioned in ""1 Henry IV."" (ii. 1), where the First Carrier says:—""God's body! the turkeys in my pannier are quite starved."" This however, is an anachronism on the part of Shakespeare, as the turkey was unknown in this country until the reign of Henry VIII. According to a rhyme written in 1525, commemorating the introduction of this bird, we are told how—

""Turkies, carps, hoppes, piccarell, and beere,
Came into England all in one yeare.""

The turkey is again mentioned by Shakespeare in 'Twelfth Night' (ii. 5), where Fabian says of Malvolio:—""Contemplation makes a rare turkey-cock of him: how he jets under his advanced plumes.""

Vulture.—In several passages Shakespeare has introduced most forcibly this bird to deepen the beauty of some of his exquisite passages. Thus King Lear (ii. 4), when complaining of the unkindness of a daughter, bitterly exclaims—

""O Regan, she hath tied
Sharp-tooth’d unkindness, like a vulture, here.""

What, too, can be more graphic than the expression of Tamora in ""Titus Andronicus"" (v. 2)—

""I am Revenge, sent from the infernal kingdom,
To ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind.""

Equally forcible too are Pistol's words in ""The Merry Wives of Windsor"" (i. 3)—

""Let vultures gripe thy guts.""

Johnson considers that ""the vulture of sedition"" in ""2 Henry VI."" (iv. 3), is in allusion to the tale of Prometheus, but of this there is a decided uncertainty.

Wagtail.—In ""King Lear"" (ii. 2), Kent says—

""Spare my grey beard, you wagtail,""

the word being used, in an opprobrious sense, to signify an officious person.

Woodcock.—In several passages this bird is used to denote a fool or silly person; as in ""Taming of the Shrew"" (i. 2)—

""O this woodcock! what an ass it is!""

And again in ""Much ado about Nothing"" (v. 1) where Claudio, alluding to the plot against Benedick, says—

""Shall I not find a woodcock too.""

In ""Love's Labour's Lost"" (iv. 3) Biron says—

""O heavens, I have my wish;
Duncan's transformed: four woodcocks in a dish.""

The woodcock has generally been proverbial as a foolish bird,—perhaps because it is easily caught in springes or nets. Thus the popular phrase ""Springes to catch woodcocks ""meant arts to entrap simplicity, as in ""Hamlet"" (i. 3)—

""Aye, springes to catch woodcocks.""

A similar expression occurs in Beaumont and Fletcher's ""Loyal Subject"" (iv. 4)—

""Go like a woodcock,
And thrust your neck i’ th’ noose.""

""It seems,"" says Nares, ""that woodcocks are now grown wiser by time, for we do not now hear of their being so easily caught. If they were sometimes said to be without brains, it was only founded on their character, certainly not on any examination of the fact."" Formerly, one of the terms for twilight was ""cock-shut time,"" because the net in which cocks, i.e. woodcocks, were shut in during the twilight, was called a ""cock-shut."" It appears that a large net was stretched across a glade, and so suspended upon poles as to be easily drawn together. Thus in ""Richard III."" (v. 3) Ratcliff says—

""Thomas the Earl of Surrey, and himself,
Much about cock-shut time, from troop to troop,
Went through the army, cheering up the soldiers.""

In Ben Jonson's ""Masque of Gypsies"" we read—

""Mistress, this is only spite;
For you would not yesternight
Kiss him in the cock-shut light.""

Sometimes it was erroneously written ""cock-shoot."" ""Come, come away then, a fine cock-shoot evening."" In the ""Two Noble Kinsmen"" (iv. i) we find the term ""cock-light.""

Wren.—The diminutive character of this bird is noticed in ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" (iii. 1, song)—

""The wren with little quill.""


Lady Macbeth (iv. 2) says—

""The poor wren,
The most diminutive of birds, will fight
Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.""

Considering, too, that as many as sixteen young ones have been found in this little bird's nest, we can say with Grahame in his poem on the birds of Scotland—

""But now behold the greatest of this train
Of miracles, stupendously minute;
The numerous progeny, claimant for food
Supplied by two small bills, and feeble wings
Of narrow range, supplied—ay, duly fed—
Fed in the dark, and yet not one forgot.""

The epithet ""poor"" applied to the wren by Lady Macbeth was certainly appropriate in days gone by, when we recollect how it was cruelly hunted in Ireland on St Stephen's day—a practice which prevailed also in the Isle of Man.",T.F. Thiselton Dyer,1997,"[45, 44, 41, 41, 44, 41, 37, 33, 33, 32, 33, 31, 33, 34, 37, 41, 32, 32, 32, 34, 40, 50, 53, 54, 83]",25

Living in the shadow
Can you imagine what kind of life it is to live?
In the shadows people see you as happy and free
Because that's what you want them to see
Living two lives, happy, but not free
You live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or the person you love
The world is changing and they say it's time to be free
But you live with the fear of just being me
Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be
No harm for them, no harm for me
But life is short, and it's time to be free
Love who you love, because life isn't guaranteed

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
I'm the cherry on the top of yo ice cream
I'm the mystic thought inside your dream
Listen to the way we pulsate the jam
I'm the nigga here with the mic in hand
Styles that we present are just a few
To do away with you and your hum drum crew
This is '93 and the shit is real
Black people unite and put down your steel
Ladies make a forum on your sexual drive
Devote it to your lover and make it thrive
The rhythm's in F, I'm a hip hop body
Release my energy with the force of a shotty
Standing on the wall with my Polo on
Talking to the girl with the Liz Claiborne
Keep the poetry in my black knapsack
Got my Timbo hooves and my Doublemint pack
Hit the city streets to enhance my soul
I can kick a rhyme over ill drum rolls
With a kick, snare, kicks and high hat
Skilled in the trade of that old boom bap
I can do a trick with the opposite breed
I used to down 40s and smoke grade weed
Now, I'm doing shows with half loot down
Now it's time for me to take ya uptown

Das war mit Abstand die schlimmste Woche
Die ich in meinem Leben je hatte
Ich weiß nicht, ob ich aufstehen soll
Und ich hab kein'n Plan, was ich mache
Denn irgendwie ist alles scheiße
Ich war noch nie so weit am Boden
Denn ich weiß, mein ganzes Geld ist weg
Und meine Frau hat mich betrogen
Uah, whatever!

Bye bye, ich fühl' mich so frei, frei
Ich will nicht mehr heim
Denn mir ist scheißegal, was morgen kommt

[Part 1]
In den Spiegel, Mann, ich brauche nichts außer dich
Wir beide packen das, ich hab' dich, du hast mich
Und hat irgendjemand von uns beiden sich mal verpisst
War das sicher wegen Geld oder irgendeiner Chick
Jetzt bin ich frei, frei, und steh' wieder auf
Ich bin allein und schrei', „Es geht wieder raus.“
Spring' in die Nikes, fly, und geh' wie der Baus
In Zeitlupe in den Club, es hat ewig gebraucht
Doch es ist Samstagnacht, ich werd' langsam wach
Und bezahl die erste Runde mit 'nem Handschlag – passt!
Was geht ab? Cro, guck mal, das ist meine Welt
Meine Hobbys sind, äh, schubsen oder Beine stellen
Oder hin und wieder bisschen faul auf 'ner Couch
Manchmal allein und manchmal mit Frauen
Doch heut bin ich im Club, nein, ich komme nicht heim
Denn wir feiern durch die Nacht, bis die Sonne wieder scheint, yeah!

Ich wache auf, schaue raus, kein'n Plan wo ich bin
Das ganze Haus voller Frauen, ey, die schlafen bestimmt
Meine Hose ist zerrissen und der Wagen ist hin
Geh' in die Küche, mach' mir erst einmal 'nen Kaffee mit Jim
Setz' mich hin, WhatsApp, was geht, bin hier
Und leb', doch geh' demnächst zu dir
Okay, und falls irgendjemand schon weiß
Was heute Abend geht, dann bitte, bitte gebt mir Bescheid
Denn ich bin irgendwie im Modus, deshalb will ich nicht heim
Probleme lös' ich locker mit 'nem billigen Wein
Gib mir noch 'n Schluck, noch 'n Schluck, noch 'n Schluck, noch 'n Schluck
Noch 'n Schluck – jap, ich bin dabadabadai!
Also gib, gib, gib, gib, gib mir 'n Becks!

And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 1: Drake]
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches

Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, ""What?"" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out and goddamn, he snap

Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh

There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow, fuck no
Go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake

[Verse 1]
I left you outside the gates of heaven
They wouldn't let me in
I waved goodbye as you stepped within
It's like hell on earth without you near
I named my daughter after you
So when she smiles it's sorta like you're still here
It's kinda crazy how time flies
Twenty-five years since my grandmoms died
But it feels like just yesterday when we was all laughing together
Those happy memories are so vivid, they'll last me forever
And yet you're still here somehow, I still feel your presence
I credit you for my inner strength, I feel it in my essence
In my soul, in my inner being, in my genetics
I wouldn't exist if you hadn't persisted through the trenches
I wouldn't have been a lyricist, I owe you every sentence
Every verse I've ever written, your energy is kinetic
Though I've grown up, I'm still heartbroken, aching to cry
Hoping you're the one holding open those gates when I die

[Verse 2]
I left you outside the gates of heaven
They wouldn't let me in
I waved goodbye as you stepped within
It's like hell on earth without you near
I named my label after you
So when I rhyme it's sorta like you're still here
It's been a year, still in shock about exactly what happened to you
Made a song for you called ""My Uncle""
I was just rapping to you
Just talking to you
I just saw you at my mother's house
I can't believe I just bought a coffin for you
We always feared that you would die from an overdose
God knows you loved to do drugs, it swallowed you whole
But in the end, drugs didn't kill you, cancer did
Why do good people die young?
I don't know what the answer is
All I know is I worshipped you as a scrappy kid
Being around you made me feel cooler than rapping did
And that's pretty fucking cool, trust me
I was embarrassed when you started smoking crack
Honestly, it crushed me - Swept it under the rug
Started smoking weed and popping acid
But managed to not do the uglier drugs
We grew apart after my grandmother died
Homeless, in and outta jail, we stopped relating to each other's lives
But years later, we connected once again
Not just as nephew and uncle, but as homies, we were friends
Though I've grown up, I'm still heartbroken, aching to cry
Hoping you're the one holding open those gates when I die",ILL BILL,1997,"[70, 66, 60, 63, 55, 52, 51, 41, 44, 49, 51, 56, 59, 59, 59, 70, 80, 85, 85, 85]",20

Six pages down and she's lighting up

Over the phone and on the street tryna kick it to me
Telling me some things but I pay it, so listen see

And I keep two niggas, with dark brown cue figures

Fuckin' niggas in the dark 'cause I don't like lights
You's a weak ass hoe, I heard you lost that fight
You's a fat muthafucka so you took that bite
How these faggots tryna talk but they pants too tight?
Asshole so sore, you got fucked that night
I don't really dig your presence so get out my sight
And I'll see you in November when you book that flight
Now relax, most of these bitches is straight whack
You can't get shit while you layin' on ya back

And sometimes it just spins too fast
And you, you not only lose your balance

And not only find your way again but find your own rhythm
Because life has a rhythm
And Mother Nature has a rhythm

And counted every breath
Looking at your little face

It felt alright to ask the Lord
For what I want the most

I wanna be there
When you’re one
And you’re just learning how to walk

And hear the funny way you talk
I wanna be there
When you’re three
And my wall’s covered up with chalk
My only prayer
I wanna be there

Well I’d like to save some money
So we can build a bigger house
Work harder at my job
And make my family proud
A million things I’ve got in mind
That I wanna do

That’s what I’ll give to you

Peepin them lips, hittin two finger sips
On the 710 freeway, I straight dips
Wit a fat one rolled up to puff
I'm ready to hit it and I won't quit it until I get enough
Tokin nothing but the bomb thats without no doubt
As she twist up another split she's straight smokin me out

To do it how we do it in the hood I live
Passin homies on the block, gettin major respect
And by then y'all the hen dog is taken effect
Never panic hit Atlantic then I banked to right
Pulled straight Nellin B's order steak and rice
With the gravy, baby gets the shrimps and fries
I'm diggin on her figure as I glimpse her thighs
She's satisfied, I left the tip and dipped to get back
To twist another zag and to grab a six pack
She went back, so we proceed to parlay
Everything is lovely and we doin it always

This ain't no love ballad
But see baby I gots to have it
When I see that bomb I grab it, cuz its a habit
So dont come with that toe down stretch
I ain't stressin, Long Beach baby keep smokin me out, she learned a lesson
Floatin high as a kite as I chill and lay low
Bumpin time is collected, sunday nights on the radio
Oh, I forgot, how lit I was, crazy glued to the seat
Dog said she need
So conversation ain't needed
When she know that I'm weeded
Headin to the hotel to regulate it and beat it

I banged it to the boogie by my head and got locced

Don't take to drinking boy that road don't lead no where

Something for nothing leaves you hell to pay so don't buy into it
And then you can look the whole world in the eye
Honey I've tried
But Since I met you girl I've been breaking every rule
I must confess I'm just a back sliding fool

I want to drink from your loving cup
Swear I'll never give you up
Steal all your kisses underneath the moon
I wanna lie here close to you look at what you made me do
Darling you're the reason why
I drink, swear, steal and lie

Last night I threw away the 12 step book
I finally faced the fact that I am hooked on you
There's nothing more that I can do Ain't no use
Cause every time I see your angel face
My halo disappears without a trace I swear

Girl I'd admit I haven't got a prayer
But I don't care
I know this ain't exactly how I was raised
But heaven help me honey I ain't changing my ways

The heart breaker
Lung taking young smart risk taker

{Verse 2: Alpha Mason}
Ima kickback, Relax & Party
Alpha Dog never fold, ain't no origami
I got the rock and the house of rap vacant
Me & house same thing, ain't no sense in guarding
She been using pro tools
Outlandish no rules
Ima have to show you
What a player do
& I get inside and rip it, everything cum fast and i get it
Noticing their focus bend with the torch, like Beckham
I got the rock ,I got the rock rock, check it
Rocks on my chain an african invention
Rocks on my chain thou
From making love the way we bang thou
I keep my aim strong from all angles
With niggas thats known to hit the white like Django
One time ....
Tell them niggas get up off her
It ain't Ironic they want cheese, they imposters
You can't see? Monster? Lockness?
Rap circles round these fuck niggas till they nauseous
You'll get lean on this New York strip
Eating good on my New York strip shit
Calls from the broad in the ball from the go
I know, like foreigners first English
That I am the don, carry on, no gas, thats on empty
But replenish
My plate full of something Roman-ish
Looking at a Young God as Lieutenant

{Bridge 2: Alpha Mason}
Lord all this land that you giveth I love
Motherland representa sent from above
First thing to greet me into home, like a rug
Music, music, music I love

193,What's Stopping You,"[Verse 1]
I wanted to sit out of this one but my God you're so convincing
I said I would, and I meant I'd try but with a wealth of doubts came a mouth full of lies
(I said that I would, and I meant every word, but it took the ending)
I sank my teeth in the kingdom come and spit out my years and held back my tongue
(And all that I heard, from the foot of my bed this was just the beginning)

[Verse 2]
Make this your business what I am about to say
The last touch between us took this all the way
Don't believe for once that I could let this go away
It's right behind, these eyes of mine even if I stay

[Verse 3]
And I wanted to fix this like you fixed my name to this
I said I would, and I meant I'd try but with a wealth of doubts came a mouth full of lies
I sank my teeth in the kingdom come and spit out my years pulled back my tongue

[Chorus 1]
Forget the wasted time we've made it
The stars are out just in time to see
The dark retreating and shadows fleeting
We found the ground beneath our feet
What's stopping you (What's stopping you)
What's stopping you don't let this in
What's stopping you (What's stopping you)
What's stopping you can't stop all of this

[Verse 4]
These clumsy arms can't be the first
Distance your regrets is what I've heard
You sit there with a pardon like a present
Oh my soul
Those words I guess I'm never gonna be alone
But I'm on my own
Don't believe for once that I would let this go away

[Chorus 2]
Forget the wasted time we've made it
(I knew it right away)
The stars are out just in time to see
(This would break all of their hearts)
The dark retreating and shadows fleeting
(I couldn't stay away)
We found the ground beneath our feet
(A good person always plays their part)
What's stopping you (What's stopping you)
What's stopping you don't let this in
What's stopping you (What's stopping you)
What's stopping you can't stop all of this

[Bridge]
Always wanted to say that I would be the first
From the ground to the table I planned and rehearsed
To be there at the moment to capture my name
But it's yours and not mine, and it's yours that he made

[Breakdown]
Lift up your hands it's surrender or praise
So you burn all your plans for the words you believed
The nails you learned to drive between
The wood and earth that made you see
That simple men of simple means
Can hold the heavens in their hands

[Outro]
Second place I find here
(I've always known my part)
The upper case is Yours not mine
(But I would love to see this through)
Teach these hands to have fear
(Could we go back to the start)
Orchestrate my words and lines
(When it was just me and you)
But I never said I wanted any of this, I never said no",Emery,1997,"[98, 97, 92, 78, 73, 80, 84, 83, 73, 85, 86]",11

And after that we can head back to the crib
And I can show you just how bachelors live
But I'm sick of bein' alone waitin' for the phone
For cutie to call with a booty call
Don't wanna be a player no more, stay up no more
All night chasin' chicks, wastin' chips
No more one night stands and brief relationships
I'd rather be with you when I ain't makin' hits

- You're just gonna waste good booze.
- It's bottom shelf.
Just let me do it.
[JESSICA] How bad is it? I assume you're a fast healer? It's not that bad.
[GROANS] [EXHALES] [METAL RATTLING] We both need some sleep.
Well, I can't until I figure out what to do.
He'll be there when you wake up.
I meant with you.
I'll still be here when you wake up.
Um For my night terrors.
- I get them, too.
- Not like this.
Would you help me? Well, how do I [ALISA] Here.
Karl usually does this for me.
How romantic.
I hope he's okay.
I hope he gets what's coming to him.
[SIGHS] I'm sorry.
[INHALES] I just miss him.
You should try to sleep, too.
You got shot today.
What does this mean? [INEZ] Um ""Good luck"" in Japanese.
Yeah, one of many mistakes by an 18-year-old me.
Have you ever been to Tokyo? Between nursing school and being homeless? Mmm Haven't really had the chance.
Maybe after this we could, um go on a trip.
It's a great city.
I know what you're doing, Jeri.
What? I can't ruminate about the future? Like how fast you'll kick me out the second Shane heals you? [SCOFFS] Cynical.
You're a user.
Takes one to know one, right? You expect me to let this go so quickly? I don't expect anything, okay? [JESSICA] That thing about having your cake and eating it, too? Whoever said that probably didn't have cake that killed people.
Is this how I get my mom? [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [TRISH] Jess, I know you're in there.
Jess, come on, it's me.
[JESSICA GROANS] [RATTLING DOORKNOB, KNOCKING] - Jess, open up.
- All right, I'm coming.
- [TRISH] Hey.
Where have you been? - [JESSICA] Hey.
Uh Out.
Look, I'm sorry I didn't call you back, but whatever it is, can't it wait? - Did you talk to Malcolm? - Yeah.
And what did he say? He said he needed to take the day off.
He went to see his parents.
Oh, good.
Is that why you came over here in the middle of the night? You don't call, I show up.
That's how it goes.
Again, I'm sorry.
I'm just beat.
Screw sorry.
Okay? We get this close to finding the killer, and you're all, ""It's done.
They're gone.
Bye""? Yeah.
They took off.
We find them.
We have passports.
I have money.
We track them down.
Can I just not do something and have that be okay? Okay, this isn't some brunch you're getting out of.
People are dying.
IGH doesn't have any other tracks to cover.
There are no more targets.
- Except you and me.
- We won't be targets if we just drop it.
They're killers! They'll kill again.
That's what killers do.
[SIGHS] What if I'm ready to move on? - Is that what you're doing? - I don't know.
Maybe.
When do I get to be normal? When do I get to have a goddamn life? After the killer's caught! Trish are you high? [TRISH SCOFFS] Are you drunk? I'm always drunk.
But I'm not blind, and I know you.
I know you.
Since when do you want anything to do with normal? - You need to call your sponsor.
- Piss off.
I'm not on anything.
Then I'll call your sponsor.
- You don't even know who she is.
- I'll find out.
[BED THUMPING] - Do you have a guy here? - Yeah, I needed the distraction.
You could have told me.
[JESSICA] Wait.
Trish.
Give me some time.
I'll find you a meeting.
[BED THUMPING] Trish, wait! Trish, wait.
We've been down this road before.
We know how it ends.
You have to call your sponsor.
Trish.
[BED CONTINUES THUMPING] Hey.
Are you all right? Where is she? Where's Jessica? I'm right here.
- Mom, wake up! - [BREATHING HEAVILY] [EXHALES] You're here.
[BREATHING HEAVILY] I always dream about you.
Losing you over, over and over again.
Same.
It's okay.
I'm here.
Here.
[JESSICA] This is how I get my mom.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR] - Hey.
- Hey.
Your window's broken.
- There's glass on the street.
- Oh.
Sorry.
I'll I'll pay for that.
- What is that? - It's a flesh wound.
- Were you shot? - Sort of.
How When did this happen? I didn't hear any shots.
The shooter used a silencer.
- Jesus! Did you call the cops? - No.
Why the hell not? Because it's my mom.
- Your mom shot you? - No, she's the target.
She's in trouble.
- What kinda trouble? - I don't want you involved.
- I'm the super.
- So? I don't know.
You're shot.
I like you.
I'm involved.
Look, this is a weird situation.
It's my kinda weird.
Powered weird? And I got this.
You just gotta trust me, okay? - You got this.
[SIGHS] - And this is temporary.
[DOOR OPENS] Look, I just wanna know you're okay, all right? - [DOOR CLOSES] - [SONIA] You kidding me? I came to drop off Vido, but what do you care? - Sonia, come on.
- Come on, what? Be happy you're on a bullet train to Freaktown? - Happy you're not home to receive our son? - It's okay, Mom.
- She a bigger priority than Vido is now? - No, she's cool.
You don't know her, baby.
I don't know her.
I do.
And I'm his father.
How could you let him be around this? [OSCAR] Dial it back, okay? He's fine with Jessica.
You don't know what she's capable of.
And I'm not going to leave him with you if she's around.
I kinda live here.
Well, fine.
Then Vido will live with me full time then.
[SPEAKS SPANISH] - Sonia, don't be dramatic.
- You wanna see dramatic? Papi Vido, it's okay, all right? Papi's got you! [SIGHS] Sorry.
She does that, like, once a week.
You go deal with your family.
I'll deal with mine.
We can compare notes later.
You sure you're okay? Yeah, I'm okay.
[JESSICA] The drug didn't kill him.
[SIGHS] That's a step toward okay.
Not okay my best friend has relapsed, and I'm not there for her.
[NEWSCASTER ON TV] One man killed, several injured after a water main burst, - flooding the basement - [CELL PHONE CHIMES] of a municipal building, and collapsing an entire wing.
Rescue teams evacuated city workers and continue to check throughout the building.
Damage to the pipe systems and buildings could cost millions in labor and flood containment [CELL PHONE CHIMES] as well as lost revenue for businesses forced to shut down during the restoration process beginning of a major overhaul in the water delivery system.
More on that in a moment.
Right now, let's go to live breaking news from Syria, brought to us by Griffin Sinclair, who's been in the war-torn region for several weeks now.
[GUNS FIRING ON TV] [GRIFFIN] I'm reporting from the Aleppo Citadel war zone, where Syrian forces have launched a full-scale offensive after three days of heavy artillery and air strikes.
[SCOFFS] Just had to be the hero.
[GRIFFIN] Militant targets were in the besieged areas, with previous gains in the Sheikh Sa'eed neighborhood.
Rebel forces on the ground have held the line around their stronghold.
Though it may only be a waiting game at this point.
- [INHALER HISSES] - [INHALES] [GASPS] [SNIFFS] Oh, God! I thought people who only wear black do that so they don't have to decide what to wear.
I like to have choices.
Have you ever worn yellow? [CHUCKLES] Not in very, very a long time.
To prom? Please say to prom.
- To a funeral, when I was eight.
- [LAUGHING] I like it.
Yellow for death.
Hmm.
Black for life.
How do you know Shane will do it? What if he says no? He will say no.
And then, I will persuade him.
[DOORBELL RINGS] Hi.
Sorry to just drop by like this, but I need to speak to Inez.
- About what? - IGH.
- It's important.
- [INEZ] What's happened? - I'm gonna put you on the radio.
- What? You're a witness to IGH's atrocities.
We put you on air, smoke out the killer.
Take them down.
Why not dangle Jessica over the shark tank instead? She needs to keep a low profile.
[HOGARTH] Forget it.
We brought Inez here to keep her safe.
She is not a puppet for your crusade.
Yeah, if you want a martyr, try East 84th and Park.
It's a church.
She means Jesus.
Well, I don't want Jesus.
I want justice.
Inez, they should pay for what they did to you.
She's already been through enough.
Jessica should've caught the killer by now.
- We're working on it.
- Where's Jessica, then? - Okay, I'm working on it.
- More like obsessing about it.
- Because it matters.
- To whom? To me.
And to anyone I can save.
You're gonna have to become a hero on someone else's back.
She's not going with you.
What is wrong with people? Why am I the only one who is prepared to step up and give a damn? Because the rest of us wanna live our lives.
- And I'm sorry if yours isn't up to par.
- [TRISH SCOFFS] Hey, fancy lawyer pants.
Thank God.
The smell of piss is disgusting.
[EXHALES] How long do you think he'll be out? Karl designed the tranq for me, so I imagine it's a hefty dose.
It's been all night, though.
So, he could come to any minute.
Good.
He'll see reason.
I'm starving.
We should eat.
This is a sad excuse for breakfast spaghetti, but it's edible.
There's no news about Pryce being missing yet.
- It's butter and jam? - What? You used to love this.
Just eat your spaghetti.
You're still a terrible cook.
Some things never change.
It wouldn't be like this, you know.
- What? - Us.
If neither of us went to jail.
Yeah, it would be hard to keep me in check.
- It would be hard without Karl.
- Well, he's gone.
Get over it.
He's not dead.
He's out there.
Well Would it help if someone brought him to you in a little plastic baggie? 'Cause that can work wonders for closure.
You kept us in a baggie? It was not you, obviously.
It's probably somebody's cremated Labradoodle.
Karl thought it would help you move on.
Why didn't you just get rid of them? Because that would be letting myself off the hook.
[ALISA] For what? The accident.
What else? What? You think that was your fault? Hey.
Look at me.
You did not cause that accident.
Your father did.
Took his eyes off the road.
He was a shitty driver.
All right, throw Dad under the bus because he's not here to defend himself.
It was his fault.
Jesus.
This whole time you've been blaming yourself? Okay Look, the [SIGHS] That feeling you have when you're behind the wheel of a car You know, the speed and the control I told you, I don't drive.
I'll give you one guess why.
I hate that it's ruined it for you because I loved it.
But your father, he needed to be in charge, like his dick would fall off if he let me drive.
I so don't need to hear about my dead father's dick.
Okay, okay.
Look, what I'm trying to say is [SIGHS] is that if I had been driving, we would all still be alive.
So it's my fault, too.
That's a great role model for your daughter, right? ""Shut up and sit shotgun.
"" You've set worse examples.
Never once did it cross my mind that any of this is your fault.
Funny.
'Cause it crossed mine about a million times.
- What are you doing? - Closure.
Is that supposed to make me feel better? Feel how you feel.
You have nothing to forgive yourself for.
You're not exactly the best judge of that.
I do what I have to.
And the only way to live with it is not to wallow in it.
And I'd do the same with him.
Why should he live when he wants us dead? Because I'm not a murderer.
It's self-defense.
- Not if he's unconscious! - Okay.
Okay.
Then then we could run before he wakes up.
You know, somewhere without extradition.
Karl and I talked about Montevideo.
Why would I go anywhere with you? Because you're mine.
And I'm yours.
As messed up as I am, we are the only family either of us has.
So you want me to be a fugitive with you? No, I just want us to have time together.
Just so we could get to know each other again.
What if he wakes up and we're just gone? What if we're gone, and we're happy? [CELL PHONE VIBRATING] Oscar? [OSCAR] Sonia took Vido.
What? She didn't pick up her phone, so I came by her place.
Her neighbor said she left with Vido, carrying suitcases.
Do you think she kidnapped him? What? Who's kidnapped? She's been wanting to take him to Peru.
I said no, thinking I'd never see him again if she did.
Now she's gone.
I need you to do what you do.
Text me her address.
Oscar's ex just kidnapped his kid.
Jesus.
Well, go and find them.
I'll stay here.
I am not leaving you alone with Pryce.
Then let me help.
[JESSICA SIGHS] [ALISA SIGHS] Let's go.
Good luck.
You ready to go? - Catch a bus.
- Get in the car, Shane.
Get your own shaky ass in the car.
I didn't ask you to get me out.
I gave you the gift of freedom.
You don't get to keep it unless you cure me.
Well, you can't put me back in.
My lawyer says I'm free and clear.
Does he know about the two assaults you were never charged for? I dug those up when I was securing your release.
I can also have you transferred to supermax after you're charged.
Shit, lady.
It takes something from me, you get that? Every time I heal someone, it's like I'm jumping toward death instead of crawling.
I just want to crawl like everybody else.
Well, you can crawl in prison if that's how you wanna spend your days.
How much are your days worth? Think your time's worth more than mine? It is to me.
- I need you to stop at a Chick-fil-A.
- A what? For energy.
[HOGARTH SIGHS] And we're back with Lila Yale, author and nutritionist of Gluten Freedom: Going Against The Grain.
We were discussing the dangers of gluten, and I'm wondering if you can tell me how many people die each year from celiac disease? Oh.
It's not a direct cause of death.
Your book says gluten can mean life or death.
I didn't mean that literally.
But gluten causes inflammation in the intestines.
Not to mention autoimmune reactions even in people who don't have celiac disease.
Gluten is the silent irritant.
Doesn't get worse than that.
So would you say it's worse than, uh, gun violence? Or what's happening in Syria? Those are certainly issues, but three million Americans are afflicted with gluten Or sexual assault? Or cancer? Gluten sensitives suffer in other ways.
Scientists have linked a gut microbe to anxiety in the brain.
Okay.
All right.
You clearly care about gluten very deeply.
But here's the thing.
It doesn't matter.
Diets.
Hair volume.
Space-saving packing tips.
None of it matters, when there's war, sex trafficking, elusive companies conducting illegal human research on kids, no less.
I could go on.
No, no, no, I will go on.
Racism, global warming, child pornography, murder, poverty, true human suffering that too many people refuse to look at.
Denial is a warm bed that no one wants to get out of, and Trish Talk is the comforter on that bed.
I keep you complacent.
I keep your eyes down.
But you know what? This show is bullshit.
I've been spouting bullshit.
Wake up, people! Face the truth.
Bad shit happens every day, and every single goddamn person has the power to do something about it.
So do something! I'm going to.
Starting with throwing off the covers and getting the hell off this shitty show.
I quit.
Yes! [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SIGHS, SPEAKS SPANISH] Gracias.
- Hey.
Is this her apartment? - Yeah, the super wasn't home.
I couldn't get a key.
Do you know where she keeps their passports? [OSCAR] In the desk.
What are you doing? Looking for receipts or notes, anything that points to where they might've gone.
It's not here.
What? [OSCAR] Captain America.
Vido wouldn't go on a trip without Cap, and Cap's gone.
- Well, so are their passports.
- Shit! [SIGHS] I just lost my kid.
We're not gonna let that happen.
Jessica's not gonna let that happen.
We're getting him back.
I should've seen this coming.
We have a custody hearing in two weeks.
She's afraid she'll lose.
How long have you been divorced? Almost two years.
Sonia has trouble letting go.
Well, it's her family.
Doesn't give her the right to mess up her kid, though.
All of these notices are past due.
[OSCAR] Sonia's never met a credit card she can't max out.
Then it might have been hard for her to get plane tickets right away.
Did you two share a credit card? We still do, for emergencies with Vido.
I'll check the account.
She just bought bus tickets.
So $122 gets you two tickets to either Niagara Falls or Montreal.
Montreal? She's trying to get him out of the country.
There's also a border crossing in Niagara Falls.
Hey, Vido! - Do you know a bus to Niagara Falls? - Sorry.
- Try 12.
That way.
Yeah.
- Are you sure? Over here? Excuse me? Where's the bus to Montreal? Schedule's inside.
Hey! Where's the bus to Montreal? Hey.
I asked you to lay low.
It's leaving now.
- Hey, you two see what happened? - Yeah.
I don't know.
Your brakes must have gone off.
Wow, you really don't drive, do you? That was really stupid.
Someone could've seen you.
[ALISA] I was just following your example.
- Thank you.
- He's my son! You think he's better off with you? No.
I think he's better off with a mother who isn't in prison.
I got nothing left, except for him.
You're his mother.
Nothing's gonna change that.
I gotta get my bags.
[JESSICA SIGHS] - [INEZ] Are you nervous? - No.
Not at all.
[HOGARTH EXHALES] Back at the clinic, this didn't always work.
- You know? - I do.
I just don't want you to be disappointed.
Putting all my eggs in an ex-con's basket.
If they break, so be it.
I'll get sicker.
But I might get stronger.
Whatever happens, I, uh I hope you'll stick around.
Ready? What are you doing? [CHUCKLES] I'm searching.
Just relax.
It helps.
[HOGARTH EXHALES HEAVILY] [CRYING] [CRYING] Oh! Do you feel anything? [IAN ON PHONE] Bloggers'll step off if you do a mea culpa.
Ian, I'm done.
You know, I don't care what the bloggers say.
Anyone blogging about Trish Talk should find something better to blog about.
- Goodbye.
- Trish! [GRUNTING] [CELL PHONE VIBRATING] - What? [GRUNTS] - [WOMAN] Trish Walker? - I have Ronald Garcia for you.
- Uh Sorry.
Ronald Garcia from ZCN? Yes, one moment.
[PHONE BEEPS] [RONALD] Ms.
Walker, I was in the car and caught the end of your radio show today.
I have to say wow! Good wow or bad wow? [CHUCKLES] Great wow.
You were so brutal, your honesty, you totally blew me away.
I never would've expected that kind of passion from you.
Well, you should get to know me better.
Exactly what I thought.
First, I wanna ask you something.
Can you do what you did today every day on live TV? [STAMMERING] You mean on ZCN? [CHUCKLES] Can we get you in tomorrow to test? Yes! Sure.
Awesome.
My assistant will be in touch with the times.
That was really something today.
Really powerful stuff.
Whatever spark made you do what you did, hold on to it.
I will.
Um, see you tomorrow.
- [LINE DISCONNECTS] - [SIGHS] [EXHALES] Ooh.
[DULL CLICK] [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] [OSCAR] Jessica Are you okay? I saw your mom.
She's like you.
[SIGHS] In some ways more than others.
Whatever trouble she's in, all I know is that she helped me get my kid back.
If you need something Papers to get her out Anything.
- I make you nervous.
- Around Oscar? Yeah.
Because the last boyfriend you met, you killed in an alley.
I don't wanna hurt you again.
Well, that's the thing.
You're not exactly in control of that.
I get it.
Why you couldn't be around me.
Why you gave me up.
There is a lot I can't forgive, but that [EXHALES] I get it.
[JESSICA SIGHS] What we did today for that boy All this time, I've been repressing my strength, hiding it.
But what if we used it? I could do something.
[THUMP] Time to talk some sense into a shark.
No amount of sense will make him stop.
Let me protect us.
I don't need your protection.
I'll lose you again.
I can convince him.
Or we could eliminate the threat.
You get that, don't you? You've had to do this before.
That was different.
Kilgrave was a threat to everyone.
But you did what you had to do.
[STAMMERING] This time, you just have to walk out the door.
You don't have to see what happens next.
I can do it right.
I can knock him out again.
It would be completely humane.
Even if I could control you I could never change you.
Who doesn't wish they could change something about their mother? So that's what you would do? If I wasn't here, you would kill him.
[GRUNTING] Do you remember trying to kill us? Just her.
Come on, let's go.
Come on.
Stay out of here.
[CHENG] Get me out of this.
Why the hell am I all wet? - 'Cause you pissed yourself.
- Christ.
How much of that drug did you give me? You could go away for attempted murder.
I'd be a hero for it.
In prison.
Or we can overlook this light kidnapping situation and call it a day.
""Light kidnapping""? You shot me.
I think we're even.
All right.
Mom's another story.
Are you just gonna let that thing out in the world? - That thing is my mother.
- She ripped my friend apart.
- He had kids.
- I know.
She's a murderer.
You can't change that instinct.
Not even with a sniper rifle.
I didn't want any cops to die.
That's why I did it.
She's gotta be stopped.
I know you know that.
[DIALING] Detective Costa? Are you anywhere near my apartment? The killer is here.
[GROANS] No! [GRUNTS] [JESSICA] Run! Mom.
[BREATHING HEAVILY] Mom.
- [SIREN BLARING] - [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [GUNS COCKING] [OFFICER 1] Hands where we can see them! [OFFICER 2 OVER RADIO] Units, be advised, suspect is a possible powered human.

[PANTING] [OFFICER 3] Miss, stay back! [OFFICER 1] Hands above your head! Now! Mom.
[OFFICER 3] Put 'em up! [PANTING] Please.
No more.
[OFFICER 3] One last time! Raise 'em! [OFFICER 1] Do it, now! [OFFICER OVER PA] Hands on your head! Slowly put your hands on your head! [JESSICA] I'm like my mother in one way.

One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Oh, you get me ready
In your '56 Chevy
Why don't we go sit down in the shade?
Take shelter on my front porch
The dandelion sun scorching
Like a glass of cold lemonade

[Pre-Chorus]
I will do the laundry
If you pay all the bills

[Chorus]
Where is my John Wayne?
Where is my prairie song?
Where is my happy ending?
Where have all the cowboys gone?

[Verse 2]
Why don't you stay the evening?
Kick back and watch the TV
And I'll fix a little something to eat
Oh, I know your back hurts
From working on the tractor
How do you take your coffee, my sweet?

[Pre-Chorus]
I will raise the children
If you pay all the bills

[Chorus]
Where is my John Wayne?
Where is my prairie song?
Where is my happy ending?
Where have all the cowboys gone?

[Bridge]
I am wearing my new dress tonight
But you don't, but you don't even notice me
Say our goodbyes
Say our goodbyes
Say our goodbyes

[Verse 3]
We finally sell the Chevy
When we had another baby
And you took that job in Tennessee
You made friends at the farm
And you join them at the bar
Almost every single day of the week

[Pre-Chorus]
I will wash the dishes
While you go have a beer

[Chorus]
Where is my John Wayne?
Where is my prairie song?
Where is my happy ending?

205,Until I Find You Again,"Lately I've been trying
To fill up my days since you're gone
The speed of love is blinding
And I didn't know how to hold on

My mind won't clear
I'm out of tears
My heart's got no room left inside

How many dreams will end
How long can I pretend
How many times will love pass me by
Until I find you again

Will the arms of hope surround me
Will time be a fair weather friend
Should I call out to angels
Or just drink myself sober again

Can't hide it, it's true
I still burn for you
Your memory just won't let me go

How many dreams will end
How long can I pretend
How many times will love pass me by
Until I find you again

I'd hold you tighter
Closer than ever before

Hold you once more

206,Far From Yours,"Uhh, yeah, phenomenon, yeah
[Yvette] Ooooh, yeah, baby far from yours, ohh yeah

[Verse 1: O.C]
Yo, time is most limited I'm back on the scene
O replenishes, potency like four or five Guinnesses
Hennessey's flourishing, O.C.is nourishing
Performin miracles, ill and mad lyrical
What stands before your very eyes is a
One man stand-alone phenomenon
Microphone misery you sufferin, taste my repetoire
In your face like a buck fifty, done with the razor
I'm felt by Aztecs, felt by Asians
Portuguese Lebanese and even Caucasians
Every form of power, they respect my stats
Slap me five, with former leader drink Cognac with diplomat
Retard your whole brigade, cave in your brain waves
(With subliminal messages) makin party people slaves
Ya hit reverse to rewind, and defy my cause
""One thing I do is keep em different, and far from yours""

[Chorus 1: Yvette Michelle]
He's no average M.C., with a smile on his face
Though they'll try to bite his style, no one can duplicate

[Verse 2: O.C]
I be the chosen one, beyond the Moet and Cristal
A son of King and a Queen, therefore ability
For song run in my genetics
I gave ideas to L. Ron Hubbard to write books on Dianetics
FedEx your info, if you wanna show the manager
Mr. Dave make sure give us a good payday too
I was assigned to Earth, on a mission
To spread worldwide my glorious compositions
Notes are like B sharps floatin
Out of my mouth from start to finish til the song diminish
My lyrical energy bring out envy in most MC's
Who listen to O, he didn't know me before
Then you know who I are now, bitin my style
That's a crime to be dealth with but we take it to trial
Verdict is in, the judge know my beef has cause
""One thing I do is keep em different, and far from yours""

[Chorus 2: Yvette Michelle]
He's no average MC, with a smile on his face
And though you try to bite his style, no one can duplicate
He can flow anywhere ya want, he can rhyme any time you say
And he's never ever ever too far, from tomorrow, today

[Verse 3: O.C]
You may never find a MC well orchestrated like a symphony
Some'll go down in history, some in infamy
The infamy will be somewhat a mystery
As long as my name O.C. live on through infinity
My identity, will ring bells in all facilities
From fans to enemies I'm the antidote and remedy
I'mma philosophize, analyze, no question
If I die I'mma return like Jesus' resurrection
I'm a blessin to the rap game, my claim to fame is when
I dissapear reappear, I put rappers to shame
Plain and simple, in common English, what I distinguish
The meanest lyric flamethrower your career's over
Finesse a mic Casanova, Don Juan or MC
The people need a change, this rap shit is deranged
Yo Raider, flip the fader, let em know my cause
""One thing I do is keep em different, and far from yours""

[Chorus 2: Yvette Michelle] (Roc Raider cuts and scratches the ""one thing"" sample)
He's no average MC, with a smile on his face
And though you try to bite his style, no one can duplicate
He can flow anywhere ya want, he can rhyme any time you say
And he's never ever ever too far, from tomorrow, today

[Chorus 2: Yvette Michelle]
He's no average MC, with a smile on his face
And though you try to bite his style, no one can duplicate
He can flow anywhere ya want, he can rhyme any time you say

208,We Trying To Stay Alive,"[Intro: Wyclef Jean]
We got the Refugee Allstars rub-a-dubbing in the club
Wyclef Jean, John Forte, Praswell
Nah mean, the streets are getting a little crazy

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Looka looka looka looka looka
Looka looka looka here looka shorty got back
Should I ask her for a dance? Hold on -- there's too many in the wolf pack
And besides, Dirty Cash talking to her
Buying her fake furs and taking her to The Fever
Quiet as it's kept, that ain't even his Benz
She spends his Franklins at the malls with her friends
Material girl, living in a material world
But it's all right cause it's Saturday night
So mister funkmaster, pump the Bee Gees
And all you college students, play your Ouijas
Check the spelling: r-e-f-u-g-e-e
Get the CD from Sam Goody, hee hee!
You ain't even close with the rhymes that you wrote
Don't be mad cause you broke
Let me clear my throat -- ah huh ah huh
John Forte, grab the mic, let's sway this way

[Verse 2: John Forte]
I'm more than just a rhymer, you still a small timer
Hoping that the game treat that ass a little kinder
Every step tango'd
Your beef don't concern me
I'm eating mangoes in Trinidad with attorneys
My crew's slang flow worldwide like a current
With the every spot where nobody got insurance
Brother, do the math -- you ain't half near exotic
My man's claim true; you -- forget about it
Po-po just a nuisance, like my influence
Well, recognize you a lie trying do it
Got juice—told your lady
Oops! We Nutz Baby
Smooth and charismatic, automatic
You gonna save me
God bless the day that my sons survive
We strive to teach the youth, baby, and stay alive

[Verse 3: Pras]
Well, you can tell by the way I roll, shorty, that I'm a ladies man
A business man
Condos down the shore
Multi-million pension plan
But it ain't in my plan to make moves without the fam
I keep it intact
Yo 'Clef, do the track
John, play the mack while I pay the tax
Business as usual
Watching suspects steal my assets
Get cut with Gillettes
We built this concept, connect like NYNEX
Drinks at the bar, my American Express

[Interlude: Wyclef Jean]
Yo I cook up cook up
The copper pull up pull up
Then I cuff up cuff up
You who's calling bluff
Now you shook up shook up
Cause you lock up lock up
When I love up love up
You who's calling bluff
Hey yo, John is chilling
Dirty Cash dealing
What more can I say, we living
That's what we got, we got it good
And since you understood
We be...

Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

[Verse 1]
They tell me, ""Don't forget where you came from""
I regret what I came from
In my old hood moving like I got a vest on me
I'ma keep on winning, you should place your bets on me
I could open up a bakery, baguettes on me
Walking through the mall, I got a check on me
Designer look the best on me
I got lots of pressure, lotsa stress on me
Independent, I got people that depend on me
Knew you was a fake, you can't pretend on me
What I used to spend on you, I spend on me
Somehow all these problems keep on landing on me
I went on a mission with a bad bitch
3AM, I'm getting Backwoods like I'm average
All this money turned me to a savage
My life was better when I didn't have shit

[Chorus]
Do you know how it feel to feel alone?
Bought myself a house, still feel like I ain't home
Driving by myself, ain't got nowhere to go
I just took two 30s, now I'm in my zone
Are you really here for me? I don't know
Are you really here for me? I don't know
Are you really here for me? I don't know
Are you really here for me? I don't know

[Verse 2]
Me and Metro Boomin' want some more, yah
All this money made me bored, yah
But there's lots of drugs to explore, yah
I'm a boss, yeah, I could employ ya
Couldn't buy one, now I got four, yah
Used to pray feds don't kick down the door, yah
Running back the sack the trap feel like a sport, yah
Yeah I'm famous but I miss my life before, yah
Finally got some money, can't go to the store
I lose every girl I love when I'm on tour
My mama calling me and I ignore
Running from my problems 'til my feet get sore

Do you know how it feel to feel alone?
Bought myself a house, still feel like I ain't home

Before I die, I hope I have a chance to make a change

[Verse 1: Crooked Eye]
I'm at the time in my life when a nigga's ready to change
I'll be dead or in jail if I don't shake this game
Feel like I'm trapped in a prison, slowly waiting to die
It's getting harder for my people, yet we don't know why
They cutting sisters off welfare, these kids can't eat
And it's the children like [?] turned out by the street
I couldn't see it while I was outside slinging my rocks
Serving death to my people, committing the ultimate evil
Robbing and killing my own kind, Lord forgive me
Blinded by this life of crime, God, somebody hear me
Since the death of my mama, my life been filled with drama
Lost both of my kids, punished for dirt that I did
I can't bring em back, so I get high to forget
All the mistakes that I made, that time won't let me erase
I keep my head up high, but I'm stuck in this game
Steady checking myself, God, help me to change

If I could change, I'd bring my mama back from the grave
I ain't got too much coming, cause we living in the last days
Crime pays, doing broads can get you AIDS, gotta wear a strap these days
All the time I stay high, trying to fight my stress
Jealous fools of the world trying to put me to rest
Last night I had a talk with my mama
Then I cried, asking god did she serve her purpose before she died
You can see it in my eyes, a brother want to slow down
I ain't mad at you daddy, 'cause you didn't come around
I'm knowing that the times is hard, but you can make it
You see the opportunity, you take it
But what about my little baby?
I got a mouth to feed but I still want to hang in the streets
And smoke weed with the O.G.'s
My homies rest in peace in the game
I don't think you even know the pain in me
I want to change

Trapped in this ghetto with my young G's calling
Hennessy and weed when they bury P
A quarter key, 6 G's, when they carry me
Fall on my knees to no nigga
Trapped in this hood, raised by chrome trigger
Never had a pops, a nigga learned to sling cream
Should have been a chemist, the way I work a triple beam
Life is like a page I want to turn
I want to make a change but Lord you let my brother burn
I done seen a nigga lose his life over [?] stones
Every night, my auntie bring a nigga home
Mama worries cause the rent late
3 strikes, my cousin's doing time upstate
I sent him Camels with no filters
I'm in the ghetto slinging stones with straight killers, uh!
I know kids that pack gats 'cause they 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm from the murder capital of the world and we rowdy, rowdy
Is there a heaven for a gangsta, Lord put me to sleep
Cause your best friend turned into your enemy
Crooked cops is dirty in this shady game
God, take me out the ghetto, I want to make a change

Say you're happy and now and I'm under your spell
Gotta know what you hide, you know me too well
And then you kiss me goodnight, tell me farewell
And you're standing all alone, in a minute you are gone

[Tash] Yeah me too nigga
[ODB] {singin' some crazy shit}

[Verse 1: Tash]
You're now rockin' with Tha Liks so start reachin' for the ozone
I see some girls I know but y'all look different with your clothes on
What's up though, Tash came to steal it like the Grinch
While I'm leavin' niggas puzzled like I said my shit in French
But it's all Olde English that I'm bringin' from beneath
Try to bite my style on wax and watch these lyrics crack your teeth
Cause I make words Connect like West Side when I test glide
My drunken lyrical hanglider, nobody's tighter
Than a ruff rap provider, with ninety ways to peel ya
So I know the three words (Tash'll kill ya) sound familiar
I filter out the weak everytime I speak
I drink to hit the peak to make my mind go (beep)
I'm def-da-fyin', you rappin' like my client
Tryin' to scrape me for the style that slam harder than Kobe Bryant
Be quiet! This is Likwidation from the West
Motherfuck ya boozy show, I got my own special guest

[Verse 2: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Yo, yo, breaker breaker breaker one-nine
I bust this bitch in the behind with the silver shine
Cause she thought she was fine
She winked at me, I thought it was fine
This nigga Poutin, this ho' was mine
I had the alcohol in me, took my time
Let a nigga ro-tate turn on the table
Put in the diamond needle, pull it to your ego
What? You the king in the chair on my ground
The Tyson of sound, it's twenty seconds to a round
Scavenger nigga, youse a shrimp, a full line of shit
My ear can't digest it
Stop drinkin' all that motherfuckin' water, let's take it to the land
So I can Godzilla up your sheeit, Mr. Tiny Tim man
Niggas be creepin' up my beanstalk
When I start to come down on your fuckin' asses
Try to chip shit on up, get these nuts
Motherfucker WHAT!!

[Verse 3: J-Ro]
The Ro pimped the flow like a ho
So I should rap on the mack-raphone
My rhymes hittin' hard enough to crack a bone
I divide square MC's like math
Bend you in half and drink a Genuine Draft
I stop him, then I skied out with all wampum
When he's layin' on the ground, I let my Dog Scrilla chop him
(Switch reels) I feels its all about skills
The outcome's unbelievable like Tyson/Holyfield
Your lyrics are loaners return em to they rightful owners
My style is wild, like G's or the pistolas
No need to ask, I put you on like a ski mask
We can Fight the Power like this was P.E. class
I Bomb Squads like Hank Shock
Peace to my nigga Scott puttin' stickers on the block
*burp* I drink more Brewsters than Punky
It's the further adventures of the hip-hop drunkies

You bitches are hoes
Put it in ya neck my motherfuckin' ho

Wherever the fuck it goes

Step outta place, Tash'll smack your taste out your face
Cause there's nowhere to hide unless you move to outer space
Cause I waste motherfuckers like toxic fumes
So you betta (make room) when you hear the (boom boom)

Hey sugar plum, how can you assume
That the pitch of the volume, doesn't have no tune
I'm not your everyday, regular rap star peddler
One on one at your rap seminar
Beware of the Hard Way, Three's the Hard Way

So aiyyo, my name is J-Ro
And my style is so dope they call it ya-yo

Extra da-llama, bring hahaha
Extra extra bring the da-llama
Verse a better one, then slice-a-versa

Like the acre without the attic, but not the only Asiatic
True God but my dick is my lightnin' rob
Ho don't kick that mumbo jumbo

See this the type of shit niggas don't try at home
I come funkin' up the spot like Micheal Jordan's cologne
With the mega drunken, style to keep the crowd pumpin'

Back in January, nah, chill.....it was December
True...cuz that's when L started his bid
Partied through the New Year, January third he slid
Up until then, yo, L had it swell
Called him Sweet Pea like his name was Pernell
He did the job, money came with ease
Blowing outta town, moving bricks and ki's
Him and his bitch, in forty-G rides
Holding down fort like they Bonnie N Clyde
Luxury cars of all makes and models
New outfits everyday, downin' champagne by the bottle
Glass in the air (air), toast to my team (team)
Toast to my cream and the scotties that beam
My niggas fiend, I'm abouts da beamer
Think about your bitch cuz yo fuck it I'm a dreamer
Called up CRU, yo, they probably in the studio

Hope she ain't slip...on that pickup

Fuck the cash nigga, pistol whip ya ass

Rolled up on the spot, (It's that kid Uzi Ed)
He took me for my paper so just call him Uzi Dead!
Used to run epps wit him back in the day
Mitch popped the trunk, passed the German AK
You dirty rat! I'm bout to bless the gat
Better take cover from the ratta-tat-tat
Uzi Ed, ain't have a vest
Three to the chest, Ed got blessed
L got life, Ed got death
The bitch took the money and she slid to the left
Back in the day, I told L she was shady
Now she in Cali about to have Ed's baby

Yo, what's the word, kid?!
Tell you bout a brother named Sid
Got work release after doing a 3-to-life bid
Cause of drug logic
Shouldn't touch it
Now out to budget
With a movie star chick from outta Edenwald Projects
Nice job, took prison camp drives
While he promised up and down to live a civilized lifestyle
The sweat off the brow was soon on garment
Both worked
Got themselves a two-bedroom apartment
Great statement, without delayment, away and went
Saved to get a house on one of them low down payments
But an idea concocted his stock
Why don't we try and turn this money over on the drug tip
So he gave his man a shriek and excitement
Didn't know his peeps were under secret indictment
Sick of the path that'll get you hung by the neck
Sent him back up north to do a super long stretch again
Black folk, you know the half, don't laugh, it's...

Just another case about the wrong path

Well, this ain't funny, so don't you dare laugh
It's just another case about the wrong path
Well, this ain't funny, so don't you dare laugh

Either way that Dee want it
Still winnin' my way
Just to make your day
Put a smile in your face
Either way that Dee wanna
Wanna give you my love
Wanna give you my trust
Spend all of my dubs
How could you play me
How could you play me baby
You did me shady
You did me shady baby
All the options that I had, I just wanted love
I can't keep letting you play me, I had enough
Shoulda known you was gonna change like a fake necklace
Now I don't want nothing to do with you I hope you get it
Cuz...

[Chorus: Dee]

225,Everything You Want,"[Verse 1]
Somewhere there's speaking
It's already coming in
Oh and it's rising at the back of your mind
You never could get it
Unless you were fed it
Now you're here and you don't know why
But under skinned knees and the skid marks
Past the places where you used to learn
You howl and listen
Listen and wait for the
Echoes of angels who won't return

[Chorus]
He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why

[Verse 2]
You're waiting for someone
To put you together
You're waiting for someone to push you away
There's always another wound to discover
There's always something more you wish he'd say

[Chorus]
He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why

[Bridge]
But you'll just sit tight
And watch it unwind
It's only what you're asking for
And you'll be just fine
With all of your time
It's only what you're waiting for

[Verse 3]
Out of the island
Into the highway
Past the places where you might have turned
You never did notice
But you still hide away
The anger of angels who won't return

[Chorus]
He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why

[Chorus 2]
I am everything you want
I am everything you need
I am everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
I say all the right things
At exactly the right time
But I mean nothing to you and I don't know why
And I don't know why
Why
I don't know",Vertical Horizon,1997,"[97, 83, 92, 94, 87, 87]",6

Hey Biggie, I understand you're from Brooklyn
With .22s in your shoes, yo, keep this joint cooking

[Verse 2: Notorious B.I.G.]
Well, why not blow up the spot with Sadat?
Release the brainstorm to make your motherfucking brain warm
A strange form, something kind of lyrical
Biggie the bastard, Sadat's kind of spiritual
Well, in God we trust, guns I bust
Got that disgusting, sewer-style dumping
And, uh, do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that I bring?
Make an MC wanna sing for a living

What? Niggas want drama, putting work on my block
When I told y'all last week that shit was too hot
Selling deuces and treys cuts my dimes
Somebody don't get paid, somebody's block get sprayed
Reaction is delayed as ya run down the block
Caught one in your chest, your breath come in spurts
Hey yo, Biggie, tell these niggas I'ma hit 'em where it hurts
The Big City, it don't spare no bodies
Call me papi chulo, to all the Spanish mamis
I'm about ten blunts down, drank three or four stouts
Seen five fat asses, passed this bitch with glasses
Hey, your money, that's your stock, yo bitch, pass the Glock
I'ma tell them, ""It can happen, don't play me with that rap shit""
Life is real, so Biggie take the steel

Biggie Smalls, the millionaire, the mansion, the yacht
The two weed spots, the two hot Glocks
Huh, that's how I got the weed spot
I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the lamb spread
Lil' Gotti got the shotty to your body
So don't resist or you might miss Christmas
I tote guns, I make number runs
I give MCs the runs dripping
When I throw my clip in the AK, I slay from far away
Everybody hit the D-E-C-K
My slow flows remarkable, peace to Matteo
Now we smoke weed like Tony Montana sniff the yayo
That's crazy blunts, mad L's
My voice excels from the avenue to jail cells
Oh my God I'm dropping shit like a pigeon
I hope you're listening, smacking babies at they christening
So you better grab your pistol
'Cause if you sit still, I'm gonna make your fucking shit spill
And I'm talking 'bout buckets, why did I have to do it?

If I could get a dollar, for everytime you look at me sideways
I'll pay the Westside on Friday's to build y'all playa haters y'all own highways
Don't trip on me partner, no uh-uh
I'm havin' visions of Bloody Mary with AIDS tryin' to give me some nana
You can't dictate mines, what I look like to you baby?
Besides the feelin' is fine
All natural like oat bran, engineered like no other
Fly for life, still as a mannequin when it comes to my mother
Capricorn baby and I'm stubborn just like you
So why don't you do me a favor and tell that lie to that fool
Don't get me twisted baby, I love you too
But when that rent and that car note come what love gon' do?
Baby, my money's on the clock, right around the block
You see me stack big knot, my music's all I got
So I'mma stay ready so I don't gotta get ready

Ain't too many I'm comin' across qualifyin'
But I be that player from the P that's just gon' keep on tryin'
I go from A to Y, cause I don't know no Z's
To the Brougham, blow the brains and enjoy the breeze
These hunnies got me wonderin' if I'll ever find one
That'll get me to that place where I wouldn't mind one
Out in traffic I see many lookin' choosable
It never fails though, I always end up usin' those
For whatever I'm needin' at that point in time
A get-away, a good one or another rhyme
I'm tired of the S.O.S. but it's real
Long as I feel 'em like I do I guess I'm just gon' deal

Now what they thought baby? We ain't comin' to raw
If she broke she gon' get a job, or break the law
They say God blessed the child, God is on it so true
We ain't get it like we got it dependin' on you

Now I can show ya better than I can tell ya, so swell
No, put your clothes back on baby
I'm into breakin' hearts, promises and fingernails
There was no I's... And I put that on the Holy Ghost and four more God's
You broke my heart and I let you succeed
Cause to a playa that's a organ that you really don't need
Low and behold, what good is havin' a heart if it can break and be re-broke?
So if you stay ready what you gon' have to get ready for?

She said she never liked you from the start
Well me, I wish that I could claim the same
But you always knew you held my heart
And you're such a charming, handsome man

Is it in your genes
I don't know
But I'll soon find out, that's for sure
Why did you play me this way

All alone

Everyday is a faded sign
I get a little bit closer to feeling fine

[Verse 3]
I've been swimming in a sea of anarchy
I've been living on compliments and herbal tea
I've been wondering if all the things I've ever seen
Were ever real
Were ever real, were ever real
Were ever really happening

237,"I Believe I Can Fly (From ""Space Jam"")","[Intro]
You know
Even when I feel like trash
Or see people struggling with cash
I realize I'm still here
So I'm thankful...
You know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 1]
I'm just a small kid, from a small town
The weather there was good, I never had a frown
Right next to the beach, I could here the ocean
The message in the bottle? My bottled emotions
No big hustle, life was no struggle
Somehow I felt like a small fry in a puddle
Sky is blue, look at the clouds
All I wanna do is make my mom proud
Fill dad with pride, I say this out loud
""Life is happening because of family""
Friendship is fishing; don't catch and release
I capture and keep them, true friends till the end
Life ain't what it seems but we shouldn't pretend
That we know all of her, it be too simple then
Look at those who love you, nothing to fear
If no one says this, well I'm thankful you're here

[Chorus]
I wanna thank you
(For everything that you do)
I wanna thank you
(Because you have a choice, you don't have to be here)
I wanna thank you
(I'm about the love, I'm fighting against fear)
I wanna thank you
(I'll try to be clear, I'm glad that you're here)

[Verse 2]
It's the year 92, born to speak to you
Just another baby whose first lady's his mom
Innocent and young, clear like the sky
I pick myself up even though I cry
You may not care if I speak of myself
But I show you one place to get you somewhere else
My life is my advice, the right kind of help
Loving girls, with or without what's under my belt
These troubles in the world, make you wanna hurl
This stress today makes me wanna go away
But hey, say this to you boys and girls
That I always find another reason to live another day
Goodshie awkward feelings or high on life
Space Jam, I believe I can fly all night
""That's great man, but peace is a fantasy""
Well then it's up to us to make it a reality

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Just a man and iron suit, when you boil it down
Fundamentally fresh, so I can't spoil it now
I catch myself asking ""Why?"" then the wind blows
It's telling me to fly, I have to let go
All my worries, all my fears
Locked in my chest, my heart's still here
Beating like the time I asked that girl out
I was probably too scared to go back to her house
Memories resurface, gotta pull the curtains
Focus on the present that I now for certain
Yeah, ""learn from the past"" blah blah blah the future
But I'm not a rookie, my flows are like fortune cookies
Uh, could have done better yesterday
But I'm all about the Now, Yes Today
No clouds of doubt, I say this real clear
Looking at the sky, I'm glad that I'm here

Could it be I move as smoove as Bugsy? (yeah)
Or be at the bar with too much bubbly? (c'mon)
Yo I think it must be the girls want to lust me
Or is it simply the girls just love me
Brothers wanna: rock the rolls, rock my clothes
Rock my ice, pull out Glocks, stop my life (uhh)
I'm like, ""Damn, how these niggas got that trife?
Used to be my man, how he gonna plot on my wife?""

'Cause their words just don't offend me (uh-uh, uh-uh)

Then come home to plenty cream Bentleys (ahehe)

So you found a girl who thinks really deep thoughts
What's so amazing about really deep thoughts?
Boy, you best pray that I bleed real soon

I got 25 bucks and a cracker, do you think it's enough
To get us there?

For somebody else to understand?
Years go by if I'm stripped of my beauty
And the orange clouds raining in my head
Years go by, will I choke on my tears

Well, I love the way we communicate
Your eyes focus on my funny lip shape

244,"The Perfect Drug (From ""Lost Highway"")","Banquet halls are a very special place, where under one big roof so many different memories are made. From proms to weddings to baby showers, once that DJ starts to spin, there's something about that cavernous echo that begs to be filled with sing-along dance tunes. Top 40 hits come and go, and no doubt there will be plenty of those contemporary tunes throughout the evening, but there are few songs that are as fun now as they were the first time. Not only do they never go out of style, they are essential components of the perfect hoe-down in all banquet halls.

1. The Chicken Dance
This song is a great opener to get the crowd going. Even the stiffest old timers can't help but get up and shake a leg when this song comes on. And what could be cuter than a gaggle of little kids all wiggling their tail feathers and squawking like chicks? This is a great song for a country-themed wedding.

2. Macarena, by Los Dos Rios
A major craze when first released in 1995, the Macarena will keep the energy up, up, up. The simple dance moves and catchy tune are an irresistible combination, and the Latin flavor will be a welcome change of beat.

3. Dancing Queen, by ABBA
Light-hearted and bubbly, Dancing Queen is a must-have for any occasion where free spirits are blooming and the night is young. Dancing Queen was written for the royal Swedish wedding in 1976, but its candy-sweet ebullience is as fresh as ever. This song has gone on to be a romantic staple at just about every wedding in the U.S.

4. My Heart Will Go On, by Celine Dion
The words are simple, the feeling is big. Lost love is in the air, and nobody ever said it better than Celine. Play this song later in the night, after a few glasses of wine have everyone misty-eyed and ready to belt out, ""My heart will go on and OOOOOOON!"" with Celine.

5. Don't Stop Believin, by Journey
The ultimate crowd-pleaser, bring the mood up again with Journey's quintessential Americana midnight adventure song. Fists will pump and memories of late-night train rides and midnight diner trysts will flood back. Even though this song came out in 1981, it still plays on the radio often enough that kids who weren't even born then know the words. It's a great goodbye, goodnight, and see you on the road song.

These time-honored tunes have been staples of banquet halls for decades because they've got that timeless jive that keeps them fresh. They are sure to bring back old memories and inspire new ones.

riage, first gave sign
Unto his contract; fire and air did shine,
As guilty of the match; and from the hill
The nymphs with shriekings do the region fill.
Here first began their bane; this day was ground
Of all their ills; for now, nor rumour's sound,
Nor nice respect of state, moves Dido ought;
Her love no longer now by stealth is sought:
She calls this wedlock, and with that fair name
Covers her fault. Forthwith the bruit and fame,
Through all the greatest Lybian towns is gone;
Fame, a fleet evil, than which is swifter none,
That moving grows, and flying gathers strength,
Little at first, and fearful; but at length
She dares attempt the skies, and stalking proud
With feet on ground, her head doth pierce a cloud!
This child, our parent earth, stirr'd up with spite
Of all the gods, brought forth; and, as some write,
She was last sister of that giant race
That thought to scale Jove' s court; right swift of pace,
And swifter far of wing; a monster vast,
And dreadful. Look, how many plumes are placed
On her huge corps, so many waking eyes
Stick underneath; and, which may stranger rise
In the report, as many tongues she bears,
As many mouths, as many listening ears.
Nightly, in midst of all the heaven, she flies,
And through the earth's dark shadow shrieking cries,
Nor do her eyes once bend to taste sweet sleep;
By day on tops of houses she doth keep,
Or on high towers; and doth thence affright
Cities and towns of most conspicuous site:
As covetous she is of tales and lies,
As prodigal of truth: this monster—

Lup.
[within.] Come, follow me, assist me, second me! Where'! the
emperor?

1 Eques.
[within.] Sir, you must pardon us.

2 Eques.
[within.] Caesar is private now; you may not enter.

Tuc.
[within.] Not enter! Charge them upon their allegiance,
cropshin.

1 Eques.
[within.] We have a charge to the contrary, sir.

Lup.
[within.] I pronounce you all traitors, horrible traitors:
What! do you know my affairs? I have matter of danger and state to impart to Caesar.

Caes.
What noise is there? who's that names Caesar?

Lup.
[within.] A friend to Caesar. One that, for Caesar's good,
would speak with Caesar.

Caes.
Who is it? look, Cornelius.

1 Eques.
[within.] Asinius Lupus.

Caes.
O, bid the turbulent informer hence;
We have no vacant ear now, to receive
The unseason'd fruits of his officious tongue.

Mec.
You must avoid him there.

Lup.
[within.] I conjure thee, as thou art. Caesar, or respectest
thine own safety, or the safety of the state, Caesar, hear me,
speak with me, Caesar; 'tis no common business I come about, but
such, as being neglected, may concern the life of Caesar.

Caes.
The life of Caesar! Let him enter. Virgil, keep thy seat.
Enter Lupus, Tucca, and Lictors.

Eques.
[within.] Bear back, there: whither will you? keep back!

Tuc.
By thy leave, goodman usher: mend thy peruke; so.

Lup.
Lay hold on Horace there; and on Mecaenas, lictors. Romans,
offer no rescue, upon your allegiance: read, royal Caesar.
[Gives a paper.] I'll tickle you, Satyr.

Tuc.
He will, Humours, he will; he will squeeze you, poet
puck-fist.

Lup.
I'll lop you off for an unprofitable branch, you satirical
varlet.

Tuc.
Ay, and Epaminondas your patron here, with his flagon chain;
come, resign: [takes off Mecaenas' chain,] though 'twere your great grandfather's, the law has made it mine now, sir. Look to him, my party-coloured rascals; look to him.

Caes.
What is this, Asinius Lupus? I understand it not.

Lup.
Not understand it! A libel, Caesar; a dangerous, seditious
libel; a libel in picture.

Caes.
A libel!

Lup.
Ay, I found it in this Horace his study, in Mecaenas his
house, here; I challenge the penalty of the laws against them.

Tuc.
Ay, and remember to beg their land betimes; before some of
these hungry court-hounds scent it out.

Caes.
Shew it to Horace: ask him if he know it.

Lup.
Know it! his hand is at it, Caesar.

Caes.
Then 'tis no libel.

Hor.
It is the imperfect body of an emblem, Caesar, I began for
Mecaenas.

Lup.
An emblem! right: that's Greek for a libel. Do but mark how
confident he is.

Hor.
A just man cannot fear, thou foolish tribune;
Not, though the malice of traducing tongues,
The open vastness of a tyrant's ear,
The senseless rigour of the wrested laws,
Or the red eyes of strain'd authority,
Should, in a point, meet all to take his life:
His innocence is armour 'gainst all these.

Lup.
Innocence! O impudence! let me see, let me see! Is not here an
eagle! and is not that eagle meant by Caesar, ha? Does not Caesar
give the eagle? answer me; what sayest thou?

Tuc.
Hast thou any evasion, stinkard?

Lup.
Now he's turn'd dumb. I'll tickle you, Satyr.

Hor.
Pish: ha, ha!

Lup.
Dost thou pish me? Give me my long sword.

Hor.
With reverence to great Caesar, worthy Romans,
Observe but this ridiculous commenter;
The soul 'to my device was in this distich:
Thus oft, the base and ravenous multitude
Survive, to share the spoils of fortitude.
Which in this body I have figured here,
A vulture—

Lup.
A vulture! Ay, now, 'tis a vulture. O abominable! monstrous!
monstrous! has not your vulture a beak? has it not legs, and
talons, and wings, and feathers?

Tuc.
Touch him, old buskins.

Hor.
And therefore must it be an eagle?

Mec.
Respect him not, good Horace: say your device.

Hor.
A vulture and a wolf

Lup.
A wolf! good: that's I; I am the wolf: my name's Lupus; I am
meant by the wolf. On, on; a vulture and a wolf

Hor.
Preying upon the carcass of an ass—

Lup.
An ass! good still: that's I too; I am the ass. You mean me by
the ass.

Mec.
Prithee, leave braying then.

Hor.
If you will needs take it, I cannot with modesty give it from
you.

Mec.
But, by that beast, the old Egyptians
Were wont to figure, in their hieroglyphics,
Patience, frugality, and fortitude;
For none of which we can suspect you, tribune.

Caes.
Who was it, Lupus, that inform'd you first, This should be
meant by us? Or was't your comment?

Lup.
No, Caesar; a player gave me the first light of it indeed.

Tuc.
Ay, an honest sycophant-like slave, and a politician besides

Caes.
Where is that player?

Tuc.
He is without here.

Caes.
Call him in.

Tuc.
Call in the player there: master AEsop, call him.

Equites.
[within.] Player! where is the player? bear back: none but
the player enter.

[Enter AESOP, followed by CRISPINUS and DEMETRIUS.

Tuc.
Yes, this gentleman and his Achates must.

Cris.
Pray you, master usher:—we'll stand close, here.

Tuc.
'Tis a gentleman of quality, this; though he be somewhat out
of clothes, I tell ye.—Come, AEsop, hast a bay-leaf in thy mouth?
Well said; be not out, stinkard. Thou shalt have a monopoly of
playing confirm'd to thee, and thy covey, under the emperor's broad seal, for this service.

Caes.
Is this he?

Lup.
Ay, Caesar, this is he.

Caes.
Let him be whipped. Lictors, go take him hence.
And, Lupus, for your fierce credulity,
One fit him with a pair of larger ears:
'Tis Caesar's doom, and must not be revoked.
We hate to have our court and peace disturb'd
With these quotidian clamours. See it done.

Lup.
Caesar! 

[Exeunt some of the Lictors, with Lupus and AEsop

Caes.
Gag him, [that] we may have his silence.

Virg.
Caesar hath done like Caesar. Fair and just
Is his award, against these brainless creatures.
'Tis not the wholesome sharp morality,
Or modest anger of a satiric spirit,
That hurts or wounds the body of the state;
But the sinister application
Of the malicious, ignorant, and base
Interpreter; who will distort, and strain
The general scope and purpose of an author
To his particular and private spleen.

Caes.
We know it, our dear Virgil, and esteem it
A most dishonest practice in that man,
Will seem too witty in another's work.
What would Cornelius Gallus, and Tibullus?

[They whisper Caesar.

Tuc.
[to Mecaenas.] Nay, but as thou art a man, dost hear! a man
of worship and honourable: hold, here, take thy chain again.
Resume, mad Mecoenas. What! dost thou think I meant to have kept it, old boy? no: I did it but to fright thee, I, to try how thou
would'st take it. What! will I turn shark upon my friends, or my
friends' friends? I scorn it with my three souls. Come, I love
bully Horace as well as thou dost, I: 'tis an honest hieroglyphic.
Give me thy wrist, Helicon. Dost thou think I'll second e'er a
rhinoceros of them all, against thee, ha? or thy noble Hippocrene,
here? I'll turn stager first, and be whipt too: dost thou see,
bully?

Caes.
You have your will of Caesar: use it, Romans.
Virgil shall be your praetor: and ourself
Will here sit by, spectator of your sports;
And think it no impeach of royalty.
Our ear is now too much profaned, grave Maro,
With these distastes, to take thy sacred lines;
Put up thy book, till both the time and we
Be fitted with more hallow'd circumstance
For the receiving of so divine a work.
Proceed with your design.

Mec. Gal. Tib.
Thanks to great Caesar.

Gal.
Tibullus, draw you the indictment then, whilst Horace arrests
them on the statute of Calumny. Mecaenas and I will take our
places here. Lictors, assist him.

Hor.
I am the worst accuser under heaven.

Gal.
Tut, you must do it; 'twill be noble mirth.

Hor.
I take no knowledge that they do malign me.

Tib.
Ay, but the world takes knowledge.

Hor.
Would the world knew
How heartily I wish a fool should hate me!

Tuc.
Body of Jupiter! what! will they arraign my brisk Poetaster
and his poor journeyman, ha? Would I were abroad skeldering for, a drachm, so I were out of this labyrinth again! I do feel myself
turn stinkard already: but I must set the best face I have upon't
now.
[Aside.]—Well said, my divine, deft Horace, bring the whoreson detracting slaves to the bar, do; make them hold up their spread golls: I'll give in evidence for thee, if thou wilt. Take courage, Crlspinus; would thy man had a clean band!

Cris.
What must we do, captain?

Tuc.
Thou shalt see anon: do not make division with thy legs so.

Caes.
What's he. Horace?

Hor.
I only know him for a motion, Caesar.

Tuc.
I am one of thy commanders, Caesar; a man of service and
action: my name is Pantilius Tucca; I have served in thy wars
against Mark Antony, I.

Caes.
Do you know him, Cornelius?

Gal.
He's one that hath had the mustering, or convoy of a company
now and then: I never noted him by any other employment.

Caes.
We will observe him better.

Tib.
Lictor, proclaim silence in the court.

Lict.
In the name of Caesar, silence!

Tib.
Let the parties, the accuser and the accused, present
themselves.

Lict.
The accuser and the accused, present yourselves in court.

Cris.
Dem. Here.

Virg.
Read the indictment.

Tib.
Rufus Laberius Crispinus, and Demetrius Fannius, hold up your
hands. You are, before this time, jointly and severally indicted,
and here presently to be arraigned upon the statute of calumny, or
Lex Remmia, the one by the name of Rufus Laberius Crispinus, alias
Cri-spinus, poetaster and plagiary, the other by the name of
Demetrius Fannius, play-dresser and plagiary. That you (not having
the fear of Phoebus, or his shafts, before your eyes) contrary to
the peace of our liege lord, Augustus Caesar, his crown and
dignity, and against the form of a statute, in that case made and
provided, have moat ignorantly, foolishly, and, more like
yourselves, maliciously, gone about to deprave, and calumniate the
person and writings of Quintus Horatius Flaccus, here present,
poet, and priest to the Muses, and to that end have mutually
conspired and plotted, at sundry times, as by several means, and in
sundry places, for the better accomplishing your base and envious
purpose, taxing him falsely, of self-love, arrogancy, impudence,
railing, filching by translation, etc. Of all which calumnies, and
every of them, in manner and form aforesaid, what answer you! Are you guilty, or not guilty?

Tuc.
Not guilty, say.

Cris.
Dem. Not guilty.

Tib.
How will you be tried?
[Aside to Crispinus.

Tuc.
By the Roman Gods, and the noblest Romans.

Cris.
Dem. By the Roman gods, and the noblest Romans.

Virg.
Here sits Mecaenas, and Cornelius Gallus, are you contented
to be tried by these?
[Aside.

Tuc.
Ay, so the noble captain may be joined with them in
commission, say.

Cris.
Dem. Ay, so the noble captain may be joined
with them in commission.

Virg.
What says the plaintiff?

Hor.
I am content.

Virg.
Captain, then take your place.

Tuc.
alas, my worshipful praetor! 'tis more of thy gentleness than
of my deserving, I wusse. But since it hath pleased the court to
make choice of my wisdom and gravity, come, my calumnious
varlets; let's hear you talk for yourselves, now, an hour or two.
What can you say? Make a noise. Act, act!

Virg.
Stay, turn, and take an oath first. You shall swear,
By thunder-darting Jove, the king of gods,
And by the genius of Augustus Caesar;
By your own white and uncorrupted souls,
And the deep reverence of our Roman justice;
To judge this case, with truth and equity:
As bound by your religion, and your laws.
Now read the evidence: but first demand
Of either prisoner, if that writ be theirs.
[Gives him two papers.

Tib.
Shew this unto Crispinus. Is it yours?

Tuc.
Say, ay. [Aside.]—What! dost thou stand upon it, pimp! Do not
deny thine own Minerva, thy Pallas, the issue of thy brain.

Oris.
Yes it is mine.

Tib.
Shew that unto Demetrius. Is it yours?

Dem.
It is.

Tuc.
There's a father will not deny his own bastard now, I warrant
thee.

Virg.
Read them aloud.

Tib.
Ramp up my genius, be not retrograde;
But boldly nominate a spade a spade
What, shall thy lubrical and glibbery muse
Live, as she were defunct, like punk in stews!

Tuc.
Excellent!

Alas! that were no modern consequence,
To have cothurnal buskins frighted hence.
No, teach thy Incubus to poetise;
And throw abroad thy spurious snotteries,
Upon that puft-up lump of balmy froth.

Tuc.
Ah, Ah!

Or clumsy chilblain'd judgment; that with oath
Magnificates his merit; and beapawls
The conscious time, with humorous foam and brawls,
As if his organons of sense would crack
The sinews of my patience. Break his back,
O poets all and some! for now we list
Of strenuous vengeance to clutch the fist.
CRISPINUS.

Tuc.
Ay, marry, this was written like a Hercules in poetry, now.

Caes.
Excellently well threaten'd!

Virg.
And as strangely worded, Caesar.

Caes.
We observe it.

Virg.
The other now.

Tuc.
This is a fellow of a good prodigal tongue too, this will do
well.

Tib.
Our Muse is in mind for th' untrussing a poet,
I slip by his name, for most men do know it:
A critic, that all the world bescumbers
With satirical humours and lyrical numbers:

Tuc.
Art thou there, boy?

And for the most part, himself doth advance
With much self-love, and more arrogance.

Tuc.
Good again!

And, but that I would not be thought a prater,
I could tell you he were a translator.
I know the authors from whence he has stole,
And could trace him too, but that
I understand them not full and whole.

Tuc.
That line is broke loose from all his fellows: chain him up
shorter, do.

The best note I can give you to know him by,
Is, that he keeps gallants' company;
Whom I could wish, in time should him fear,
Lest after they buy repentance too dear.
DEME. FANNIUS.

Tuc.
Well said! This carries palm with it.

Hor.
And why, thou motley gull, why should they fear!
When hast thou known us wrong or tax a friend?
I dare thy malice to betray it. Speak.
Now thou curl'st up, thou poor and nasty snake,
And shrink'st thy poisonous head into thy bosom:
Out, viper! thou that eat'st thy parents, hence!
Rather, such speckled creatures, as thyself,
Should be eschew'd, and shunn'd; such as will bite
And gnaw their absent friends, not cure their fame;
Catch at the loosest laughters, and affect
To be thought jesters; such as can devise
Things never seen, or head, t'impair men's names,
And gratify their credulous adversaries;
Will carry tales, do basest offices,
Cherish divided fires, and still encrease
New flames, out of old embers; will reveal
Each secret that's committed to their trust:
These be black slaves; Romans, take heed of these.

Tuc.
Thou twang'st right, little Horace: they be indeed a couple of
chap-fall'n curs. Come, we of the bench, let's rise to the urn, and
condemn them quickly.

Virg.
Before you go together, worthy Romans,
We are to tender our opinion;
And give you those instructions, that may add
Unto your even judgment in the cause:
Which thus we do commence. First, you must know,
That where there is a true and perfect merit,
There can be no dejection; and the scorn
Of humble baseness, oftentimes so works
In a high soul, upon the grosser spirit,
That to his bleared and offended sense,
There seems a hideous fault blazed in the object;
When only the disease is in his eyes.
Here-hence it comes our Horace now stands tax'd
Of impudence, self-love, and arrogance,
By those who share no merit in themselves;
And therefore think his portion is as small.
For they, from their own guilt, assure their souls,
If they should confidently praise their works,
In them it would appear inflation:
Which, in a full and well digested man,
Cannot receive that foul abusive name,
But the fair title of erection.
And, for his true use of translating men,
It still hath been a work of as much palm,
In clearest judgments, as to invent or make,
His sharpness,—-that is most excusable;
As being forced out of a suffering virtue,
Oppressed with the license of the time:—-
And howsoever fools or jerking pedants,
Players, or suchlike buffoon barking wits,
May with their beggarly and barren trash
Tickle base vulgar ears, in their despite;
This, like Jove's thunder, shall their pride control,
""The honest satire hath the happiest soul.""

Now, Romans, you have heard our thoughts;
withdraw when you please.

Tib.
Remove the accused from the bar.

Tuc.
Who holds the urn to us, ha? Fear nothing, I'll quit you, mine
honest pitiful stinkards; I'll do't.

Cris.
Captain, you shall eternally girt me to you, as I am
generous.

Tuc.
Go to.

Caes.
Tibullus, let there be a case of vizards privately provided;
we have found a subject to bestow them on.

Tib.
It shall be done, Caesar.

Caes.
Here be words, Horace, able to bastinado a man's ears.

Hor. Ay.
Please it, great Caesar, I have pills about me,
Mixt with the whitest kind of hellebore,
Would give him a light vomit, that should purge
His brain and stomach of those tumorous heats:
Might I have leave to minister unto him.

Caes.
O, be his AEsculapius, gentle Horace!
You shall have leave, and he shall be your patient. Virgil,
Use your authority, command him forth.

Virg.
Caesar is careful of your health, Crispinus;
And hath himself chose a physician
To minister unto you: take his pills.

Hor.
They are somewhat bitter, sir, but very wholesome.
Take yet another; so: stand by, they'll work anon.

Tib.
Romans, return to your several seats: lictors, bring forward
the urn; and set the accused to the bar.

Tuc.
Quickly, you whoreson egregious varlets; come forward. What!
shall we sit all day upon you? You make no more haste now, than a
beggar upon pattens; or a physician to a patient that has no money,
you pilchers.

Tib.
Rufus Laberius Crispinus, and Demetrius Fannius, hold up your
hands. You have, according to the Roman custom, put yourselves upon trial to the urn, for divers and sundry calumnies, whereof you
have, before this time, been indicted, and are now presently
arraigned: prepare yourselves to hearken to the verdict of your
tryers. Caius Cilnius Mecaenas pronounceth you, by this
hand-writing, guilty. Cornelius Gallus, guilty. Pantilius Tucca—

Tuc.
Parcel-guilty, I.

Dem.
He means himself; for it was he indeed
Suborn'd us to the calumny.

Tuc.
I, you whoreson cantharides! was it I?

Dem.
I appeal to your conscience, captain.

Tib.
Then you confess it now?

Dem.
I do, and crave the mercy of the court.

Tib.
What saith Crispinus?

Cris.
O, the captain, the captain—-

Bor.
My physic begins to work with my patient, I see.

Virg.
Captain, stand forth and answer.

Tuc.
Hold thy peace, poet praetor: I appeal from thee to Caesar, I.
Do me right, royal Caesar.

Caes.
Marry, and I will, sir.—-Lictors, gag him; do.
And put a case of vizards o'er his head,
That he may look bifronted, as he speaks.

Tuc.
Gods and fiends! Caesar! thou wilt not, Caesar, wilt thou?
Away, you whoreson vultures; away. You think I am a dead corps now, because Caesar is disposed to jest with a man of mark, or so. Hold  your hook'd talons out of my flesh, you inhuman harpies. Go to, do't. What! will the royal Augustus cast away a gentleman of
worship, a captain and a commander, for a couple of condemn'd
caitiff calumnious cargos?

Caes.
Dispatch, lictors.

Tuc. Caesar!
[The vizards are put upon him.

Caes.
Forward, Tibullus.

Virg.
Demand what cause they had to malign Horace.

Dem.
In troth, no great cause, not I, I must confess; but that he
kept better company, for the most part, than I; and that better men
loved him than loved me; and that his writings thrived better than
mine, and were better liked and graced: nothing else.

Virg.
Thus envious souls repine at others' good.

Hor.
If this be all, faith, I forgive thee freely.
Envy me still, so long as Virgil loves me,
Gallus, Tibullus, and the best-best Caesar,
My dear Mecaenas; while these, with many more,
Whose names I wisely slip, shall think me worthy
Their honour'd and adored society,
And read and love, prove and applaud my poems;
I would not wish but such as you should spite them.

Cris.
O—!

Tib.
How now, Crispinus? C

Cris.
O, I am sick—!

Hor.
A bason, a bason, quickly; our physic works. Faint not, man.

Cris.
O———retrograde———reciprocal———incubus.

Caes.
What's that, Horace?

Hor.
Retrograde, reciprocal, and incubus, are come up.

Gal.
Thanks be to Jupiter!

Cris.
O———glibbery———lubrical———defunct———O———!

Hor.
Well said; here's some store.

Virg.
What are they?

Hor.
Glibbery, lubrical, and defunct.

Gal.
O, they came up easy.

Cris.
O———O———!

Tib.
What's that?

Hor.
Nothing yet.

Cris.
Magnificate———

Mec.
Magnificate!  That came up somewhat hard.

Hor.
Ay. What cheer, Crispinus?

Cris.
O! I shall cast up my———spurious———snotteries———

Hor.
Good. Again.

Oris.
Chilblain'd———O———O———clumsie———

Hor.
That clumsie stuck terribly.

Mec.
What's all that, Horace?

Hor.
Spurious, snotteries, chilblain'd, clumsie.

Tib.
O Jupiter!

Gal.
Who would have thought there should have been such a deal of
filth in a poet?

Cris.
O———balmy froth———

Caes.
What's that?

Cris.
———Puffie———inflate———turgidious———-ventosity.

Hor.
Balmy, froth, puffie, inflate, turgidous, and ventosity are
come up.

Tib.
O terrible windy words.

Gal.
A sign of a windy brain.

Cris.
O———oblatrant———furibund———fatuate———strenuous—-

Hor.
Here's a deal; oblatrant, furibund, fatuate, strenuous.

Caes.
Now all's come up, I trow. What a tumult he had in his belly?

Hor.
No, there's the often conscious damp behind still.

Cris.
O———conscious———damp.

Hor.
It is come up, thanks to Apollo and AEsculapius: another; you
were best take a pill more.

Cris.
O, no; O———O———O———O———O!

Hor.
Force yourself then a little with your finger.

Cris.
O———O———prorumped.

Tib.
Prorumped I What a noise it made! as if his spirit would have
prorumpt with it.

Cris.
O———O———O!

Virg.
Help him, it sticks strangely, whatever it is.

Cris.
O———clutcht

Hor.
Now it is come; clutcht.

Caes.
Clutcht!  it is well that's come up; it had but a narrow
passage.

Cris.
O———!

Virg.
Again! hold him, hold his head there.

Cris.
Snarling gusts———quaking custard.

Hor.
How now, Crispinus?

Cris.
O———obstupefact.

Tib.
Nay, that are all we, I assure you.

Hor.
How do you feel yourself?

Cris.
Pretty and well, I thank you.

Virg.
These pills can but restore him for a time,
Not cure him quite of such a malady,
Caught by so many surfeits, which have fill'd
His blood and brain thus full of crudities:
'Tis necessary therefore he observe
A strict and wholesome diet. Look you take
Each morning of old Cato's principles
A good draught next your heart; that walk upon,
Till it be well digested: then come home,
And taste a piece of Terence, suck his phrase
Instead of liquorice; and, at any hand,
Shun Plautus and old Ennius: they are meats
Too harsh for a weak stomach.
Use to read (But not without a tutor) the best Greeks,
As Orpheus, Musaeus, Pindarus,
Hesiod, Callimachus, and Theocrite,
High Homer; but beware of Lycophron,
He is too dark and dangerous a dish.
You must not hunt for wild outlandish terms,
To stuff out a peculiar dialect;
But let your matter run before your words.
And if at any time you chance to meet
Some Gallo-Belgic phrase; you shall not straight.
Rack your poor verse to give it entertainment,
But let it pass; and do not think yourself
Much damnified, if you do leave it out,
When nor your understanding, nor the sense
Could well receive it. This fair abstinence,
In time, will render you more sound and clear:
And this have I prescribed to you, in place
Of a strict sentence; which till he perform,
Attire him in that robe. And henceforth learn
To bear yourself more humbly; not to swell,
Or breathe your insolent and idle spite
On him whose laughter can your worst affright.

Tib.
Take him away.

Cris.
Jupiter guard Caesar!

Virg.
And for a week or two see him lock'd up
In some dark place, removed from company;
He will talk idly else after his physic.
Now to you, sir. [to Demetrius.] The extremity of law
Awards you to be branded in the front,
For this your calumny: but since it pleaseth
Horace, the party wrong'd, t' intreat of Caesar
A mitigation of that juster doom,
With Caesar's tongue thus we pronounce your sentence.
Demetrius Fannius, thou shalt here put on
That coat and cap, and henceforth think thyself
No other than they make thee; vow to wear them
In every fair and generous assembly,
Till the best sort of minds shall take to knowledge
As well thy satisfaction, as thy wrongs.

Hor.
Only, grave praetor, here, in open court,
I crave the oath for good behaviour
May be administer'd unto them both.

Virg.
Horace, it shall: Tibullus, give it them.

Tib.
Rufus Laberius Crispinus, and Demetrius Fannius, lay your
hands on your hearts. You shall here solemnly attest and swear,
that never, after this instant, either at booksellers' stalls, in
taverns, two-penny rooms, tyring-houses, noblemen's butteries,
puisents chambers, (the best and farthest places where you are
admitted to come,) you shall once offer or dare (thereby to endear
yourself the more to any player, enghle, or guilty gull in your
company) to malign, traduce, or detract the person or writings of
Quintus Horatius Flaccus, or any other eminent men, transcending
you in merit, whom your envy shall find cause to work upon, either
for that, or for keeping himself in better acquaintance, or
enjoying better friends, or if, transported by any sudden and
desperate resolution, you do, that then you shall not under the
batoon, or in the next presence, being an honourable assembly of
his favourers, be brought as voluntary gentlemen to undertake the
for-swearing of it. Neither shall you, at any time, ambitiously
affecting the title of the Untrussers or Whippers of the age,
suffer the itch of writing to over-run your performance in libel,
upon pain of being taken up for lepers in wit, and, losing both
your time and your papers, be irrecoverably forfeited to the
hospital of fools. So help you our Roman gods and the Genius of
great Caesar.

Virg.
So! now dissolve the court.

Bor. Tib. Gal. Mec.
And thanks to Caesar, That thus hath exercised his patience.

Caes.
We have, indeed, you worthiest friends of Caesar.
It is the bane and torment of our ears,
To hear the discords of those jangling rhymers,
That with their bad and scandalous practices
Bring all true arts and learning in contempt.
But let not your high thoughts descend so low
As these despised objects; let them fall,
With their flat grovelling souls: be you yourselves;
And as with our best favours you stand crown'd,
So let your mutual loves be still renown'd.
Envy will dwell where there is want of merit,
Though the deserving man should crack his spirit.

Blush, folly, blush; here's none that fears
The wagging of an ass's ears,
Although a wolfish case he wears.
Detraction is but baseness' varlet;
And apes are apes, though clothed in scarlet.

                                    HORACE AND TREBATIUS.
                                                A DIALOGUE.
                                                Sat. 1. Lib. 2.

Hor.
There are to whom I seem excessive sour,
And past a satire's law t' extend my power:
Others, that think whatever I have writ
Wants pith and matter to eternise it;
And that they could, in one day's light, disclose
A thousand verses, such as I compose.
What shall I do, Trebatius? say.

Treb.
Surcease.

Hor.
And shall my muse admit no more increase?

Treb.
So I advise.

Hor.
An ill death let me die,
If 'twere not best; but sleep avoids mine eye,
And I use these, lest nights should tedious seem.

Treb.
Rather, contend to sleep, and live like them,
That, holding golden sleep in special price,
Rubb'd with sweet oils, swim silver Tyber thrice,
And every even with neat wine steeped be:
Or, if such love of writing ravish thee,
Then dare to sing unconquer'd Caesar's deeds;
Who cheers such actions with abundant meeds.

Hor.
That, father, I desire; but, when I try,
I feel defects in every faculty:
Nor is't a labour fit for every pen,
To paint the horrid troops of armed men,
The lances burst, in Gallia's slaughter'd forces;
Or wounded Parthians, tumbled from their horses:
Great Caesar's wars cannot be fought with words.

Treb.
Yet, what his virtue in his peace affords,
His fortitude and justice thou canst shew
As wise Lucilius honour'd Scipio.

Hor.
Of that, my powers shall suffer no neglect,
When such slight labours may aspire respect:
But, if I watch not a most chosen time,
The humble words of Flaccus cannot climb
Th' attentive ear of Caesar; nor must I
With less observance shun gross flattery:
For he, reposed safe in his own merit,
Spurns back the gloses of a fawning spirit.

Treb.
But how much better would such accents sound
Than with a sad and serious verse to wound
Pantolabus, railing in his saucy jests,
Or Nomentanus spent in riotous feasts?
In satires, each man, though untouch'd, complains
As he were hurt; and hates such biting strains.

Hor.
What shall I do? Milonius shakes his heels
In ceaseless dances, when his brain once feels
The stirring fervour of the wine ascend;
And that his eyes false numbers apprehend.
Castor his horse, Pollux loves handy-fights;
A thousand heads, a thousand choice delights.
My pleasure is in feet my words to close,
As, both our better, old Lucilius does:
He, as his trusty friends, his books did trust
With all his secrets; nor, in things unjust,
Or actions lawful, ran to other men:
So that the old man's life described, was seen
As in a votive table in his lines:
And to his steps my genius inclines;
Lucanian, or Apulian, I know not whether,
For the Venusian colony ploughs either;
Sent thither, when the Sabines were forced thence,
As old Fame sings, to give the place defence
'Gainst such as, seeing it empty, might make road
Upon the empire; or there fix abode:
Whether the Apulian borderer it were,
Or the Lucanian violence they fear.—-
But this my style no living man shall touch,
If first I be not forced by base reproach;
But like a sheathed sword it shall defend
My innocent life; for why should I contend
To draw it out, when no malicious thief
Robs my good name, the treasure of my life?
O Jupiter, let it with rust be eaten,
Before it touch, or insolently threaten
The life of any with the least disease;
So much I love, and woo a general peace.
But, he that wrongs me, better, I proclaim,
He never had assay'd to touch my fame.
For he shall weep, and walk with every tongue
Throughout the city, infamously sung.
Servius the praetor threats the laws, and urn,
If any at his deeds repine or spurn;
The witch Canidia, that Albutius got,
Denounceth witchcraft, where she loveth not;
Thurius the judge, doth thunder worlds of ill,
To such as strive with his judicial will.
All men affright their foes in what they may,
Nature commands it, and men must obey.
Observe with me: The wolf his tooth doth use,
The bull his horn; and who doth this infuse,
But nature? There's luxurious Scaeva; trust
His long-lived mother with him; his so just
And scrupulous right-hand no mischief will;
No more than with his heel a wolf will kill,
Or ox with jaw: marry, let him alone
With temper'd poison to remove the croan.
But briefly, if to age I destined be,
Or that quick death's black wings environ me;
If rich, or poor; at Rome; or fate command
I shall be banished to some other land;
What hue soever my whole state shall bear,
I will write satires still, in spite of fear.

Treb.
Horace, I fear thou draw'st no lasting breath;
And that some great man's friend will be thy death.

Hor.
What! when the man that first did satirise
Durst pull the skin over the ears of vice,
And make who stood in outward fashion clear,
Give place, as foul within; shall I forbear?
Did Laelius, or the man so great with fame,
That from sack'd Carthage fetch'd his worthy name,
Storm that Lucilius did Metellus pierce,
Or bury Lupus quick in famous verse?
Rulers and subjects, by whole tribes he checkt,
But virtue and her friends did still protect:
And when from sight, or from the judgment-seat,
The virtuous Scipio and wise Laelius met,
Unbraced, with him in all light sports they shared,
Till their most frugal suppers were prepared.
Whate'er I am, though both for wealth and wit
Beneath Lucilius I am pleased to sit;
Yet Envy, spite of her empoison'd breast,
Shall say, I lived in grace here with the best;
And seeking in weak trash to make her wound,
Shall find me solid, and her teeth unsound:
'Less learn'd Trebatius' censure disagree.

Treb.
No, Horace, I of force must yield to thee;
Only take heed, as being advised by me,
Lest thou incur some danger: better pause,
Than rue thy ignorance of the sacred laws;
There's justice, and great action may be sued
'Gainst such as wrong men's fames with verses lewd.

Hor.
Ay, with lewd verses, such as libels be,
And aim'd at persons of good quality:
I reverence and adore that just decree.
But if they shall be sharp, yet modest rhymes,
That spare men's persons, and but tax their crimes,
Such shall in open court find current pass,
Were Caesar judge, and with the maker's grace.

Treb.
Nay, I'll add more; if thou thyself, being clear,
Shall tax in person a man fit to bear
Shame and reproach, his suit shall quickly be
Dissolved in laughter, and thou thence set free.

                                                TO THE READER

If, by looking on what is past, thou hast deserved that name, I am
willing thou should'st yet know more, by that which follows, an
APOLOGETICAL DIALOGUE; which was only once spoken upon the stage and all the answer I ever gave to sundry impotent libels then cast out (and some yet remaining) against me, and this play. Wherein I take no pleasure to revive the times; but that posterity may make a difference between their manners that provoked me then, and mine that neglected them ever, For, in these strifes, and on such persons, were as wretched to affect a victory, as it is unhappy to be committed with them.

            Non annorum canities est laudanda, sed morum.
                                 SCENE, The Author's Lodgings.
                              Enter NASUTUS and POLYPOSUS.

Nas.
I pray You let' s go see him, how he looks
After these libels.

Pol.
O vex'd, vex'd, I warrant you.

Nas. Do you think so? I should be sorry for him,
If I found that.

Pol.
O, they are such bitter things,
He cannot choose.

Nas.
But, is he guilty of them?

Pol.
Fuh! that's no matter.

Nas.
No!

Pol.
No. Here's his lodging.
We'll steal upon him: or let's listen; stay.
He has a humour oft to talk t' himself.

Nas.
They are your manners lead me, not mine own.

[They come forward; the scene opens, and discovers the
Author in his study.

Aut.
The fates have not spun him the coarsest thread,
That (free from knots of perturbation)
Doth yet so live, although but to himself,
As he can safely scorn the tongues of slaves,
And neglect fortune, more than she can him.
It is the happiest thing this, not to be
Within the reach of malice; it provides
A man so well, to laugh off injuries;
And never sends him farther for his vengeance,
Than the vex'd bosom of his enemy.
I, now, but think how poor their spite sets off,
Who, after all their waste of sulphurous terms,
And burst-out thunder of their charged mouths,
Have nothing left but the unsavoury smoke
Of their black vomit, to upbraid themselves:
Whilst I, at whom they shot, sit here shot-free,
And as unhurt of envy, as unhit.

[Pol. and Nas. discover themselves.

Pol.
Ay, but the multitude they think not so, sir,
They think you hit, and hurt: and dare give out,
Your silence argues it in not rejoining
To this or that late libel.

Aut.
'Las, good rout!
I can afford them leave to err so still;
And like the barking students of Bears-college,
To swallow up the garbage of the time
With greedy gullets, whilst myself sit by,
Pleased, and yet tortured, with their beastly feeding.
'Tis a sweet madness runs along with them,
To think, all that are aim'd at still are struck:
Then, where the shaft still lights, make that the mark:
And so each fear or fever-shaken fool
May challenge Teucer's hand in archery.
Good troth, if I knew any man so vile,
To act the crimes these Whippers reprehend,
Or what their servile apes gesticulate,
I should not then much muse their shreds were liked;
Since ill men have a lust t' hear others' sins,
All good men have a zeal to hear sin shamed.
But when it is all excrement they vent,
Base filth and offal; or thefts, notable
As ocean-piracies, or highway-stands;
And not a crime there tax'd, but is their own,
Or what their own foul thoughts suggested to them;
And that, in all their heat of taxing others,
Not one of them but lives himself, if known,
Improbior satiram scribente cinaedo
What should I say more, than turn stone with wonder!

Nas.
I never saw this play bred all this tumult:
What was there in it could so deeply offend
And stir so many hornets?

Aut.
Shall I tell you?

Nas.
Yea, and ingeniously.

Aut.
Then, by the hope
Which I prefer unto all other objects,
I can profess, I never writ that piece
More innocent or empty of offence.
Some salt it had, but neither tooth nor gall,
Nor was there in it any circumstance
Which. in the setting down, I could suspect
Might be perverted by an enemy's tongue;
Only it had the fault to be call'd mine;
That was the crime.

Pol.
No! why, they say you tax'd
The law and lawyers, captains and the players,
By their particular names.

Aut.
It is not so.
I used no name. My books have still been taught
To spare the persons, and to speak the vices.
These are mere slanders, and enforced by such
As have no safer ways to men's disgraces.
But their own lies and loss of honesty:
Fellows of practised and most laxative tongues,
Whose empty and eager bellies, in the year,
Compel their brains to many desperate shifts,
(I spare to name them, for their wretchedness
Fury itself would pardon). These, or such,
Whether of malice, or of ignorance,
Or itch t' have me their adversary, I know not,
Or all these mixt; but sure I am, three years
They did provoke me with their petulant styles
On every stage: and I at last unwilling,
But weary, I confess, of so much trouble,
Thought I would try if shame could win upon 'em,'
And therefore chose Augustus Caesar's times,
When wit and area were at their height in Rome,
To shew that Virgil, Horace, and the rest
Of those great master-spirits, did not want
Detractors then, or practicers against them:
And by this line, although no parallel,
I hoped at last they would sit down and blush;
But nothing I could find more contrary.
And though the impudence of flies be great,
Yet this hath so provok'd the angry wasps,
Or, as you said, of the next nest, the hornets,
That they fly buzzing, mad, about my nostrils,
And, like so many screaming grasshoppers
Held by the wings, fill every ear with noise.
And what? those former calumnies you mention'd.
First, of the law: indeed I brought in Ovid
Chid by his angry father for neglecting
The study of their laws for poetry:
And I am warranted by his own words:

Saepe pater dixit, studium quid inutile tentas!
Maeonides nullas ipse reliquit opes.

And in far harsher terms elsewhere, as these:

Non me verbosas leges ediscere, non me
Ingrato voces prostituisse foro.

But how this should relate unto our laws,
Or the just ministers, with least abuse,
I reverence both too much to understand!
Then, for the captain, I will only speak
An epigram I here have made: it is

UNTO TRUE SOLDIERS.
That's the lemma: mark it.
Strength of my country, whilst I bring to view
Such: as are miss-call'd captains, and wrong you,
And your high names; I do desire, that thence,
Be nor put on you, nor you take offence:
I swear by your true friend, my muse, I love
Your great profession which I once did prove;
And did not shame it with my actions then,
No more than I dare now do with my pen.
He that not trusts me, having vowed thus much,
But's angry for the captain, still: is such.
Now for the players, it is true, I tax'd them,
And yet but some; and those so sparingly,
As all the rest might have sat still unquestion'd,
Had they but had the wit or conscience
To think well of themselves. But impotent, they
Thought each man's vice belong'd to their whole tribe;
And much good do't them! What they have done 'gainst me,
I am not moved with: if it gave them meat,
Or got them clothes, 'tis well; that was their end.
Only amongst them, I am sorry for
Some better natures, by the rest so drawn,
To run in that vile line.

Pol.
And is this all!
Will you not answer then the libels?

Aut.
No.

Pol.
Nor the Untrussers?

Aut.
Neither.

Pol.
Y'are undone then.

Aut.
With whom?

Pol.
The world.

Aut.
The bawd!

Pol.
It will be taken
To be stupidity or tameness in you.

Aut.
But they that have incensed me, can in soul
Acquit me of that guilt. They know I dare
To spurn or baffle them, or squirt their eyes
With ink or urine; or I could do worse,
Arm'd with Archilochus' fury, write Iambics,
Should make the desperate lashers hang themselves;
Rhime them to death, as they do Irish rats
In drumming tunes. Or, living, I could stamp
Their foreheads with those deep and public brands,
That the whole company of barber-surgeon a
Should not take off with all their art and plasters.
And these my prints should last, still to be read
In their pale fronts; when, what they write 'gainst me
Shall, like a figure drawn in water, fleet,
And the poor wretched papers be employed
To clothe tobacco, or some cheaper drug:
This I could do, and make them infamous.
But, to what end? when their own deeds have mark'd 'em;
And that I know, within his guilty breast
Each slanderer bears a whip that shall torment him
Worse than a million of these temporal plagues:
Which to pursue, were but a feminine humour,
And far beneath the dignity of man.

Nas.
'Tis true; for to revenge their injuries,
Were to confess you felt them. Let them go,
And use the treasure of the fool, their tongues,
Who makes his gain, by speaking worst of beat.

Pol.
O, but they lay particular imputations—

Aut.
As what?

Pol.
That all your writing is mere railing.

Aut.
Ha?
If all the salt in the old comedy
Should be so censured, or the sharper wit
Of the bold satire termed scolding rage,
What age could then compare with those for buffoons?
What should be said of Aristophanes,
Persius, or Juvenal, whose names we now
So glorify in schools, at least pretend it?—-
Have they no other?

Pol.
Yes; they say you are slow,
And scarce bring forth a play a year.

Aut.
'Tis true.
I would they could not say that I did that!
There' s all the joy that I take in their trade,
Unless such scribes as these might be proscribed
Th' abused theatres. They would think it strange, now,
A man should take but colts-foot for one day,
And, between whiles, spit out a better poem
Than e'er the master of art, or giver of wit,
Their belly, made. Yet, this is possible,
If a free mind had but the patience,
To think so much together and so vile.
But that these base and beggarly conceits
Should carry it, by the multitude of voices,
Against the most abstracted work, opposed
To the stuff'd nostrils of the drunken rout!
O, this would make a learn'd and liberal soul
To rive his stained quill up to the back,
And damn his long-watch'd labours to the fire,
Things that were born when none but the still night
And his dumb candle, saw his pinching throes,
Were not his own free merit a more crown
Unto his travails than their reeling claps.
This 'tis that strikes me silent, seals my lips,
And apts me rather to sleep out my time,
Than I would waste it in contemned strifes
With these vile Ibides, these unclean birds,
That make their mouths their clysters, and still purge
From their hot entrails. But I leave the monsters
To their own fate. And, since the Comic Muse
Hath proved so ominous to me, I will try
If TRAGEDY have a more kind aspect;
Her favours in my next I will pursue,
Where, if I prove the pleasure but of one,
So he judicious be, he shall be alone
A theatre unto me; Once I'll say
To strike the ear of time in those fresh strains,
As shall, beside the cunning of their ground,
Give cause to some of wonder, some despite,
And more despair, to imitate their sound.
I, that spend half my nights, and all my days,
Here in a cell, to get a dark paleface,
To come forth worth the ivy or the bays,
And in this age can hope no other grace—-
Leave me! There's something come into my thought,
That must and shall be sung high and aloof,
Safe from the wolfs black jaw, and the dun ass's hoof

Nas.
I reverence these raptures, and obey them.

245,"My Heart Is Calling (From ""The Preacher's Wife"")","All circumstances taken together, the French revolution is the most astonishing that has hitherto happened in the world. The most wonderful things are brought about, in many instances by means the most absurd and ridiculous, in the most ridiculous modes, and apparently by the most contemptible instruments. Everything seems out of nature in this strange chaos of levity and ferocity, and of all sorts of crimes jumbled together with all sorts of follies. In viewing this monstrous tragicomic scene, the most opposite passions necessarily succeed and sometimes mix with each other in the mind: alternate contempt and indignation, alternate laughter and tears, alternate scorn and horror.

***

You will observe that from Magna Charta to the Declaration of Right it has been the uniform policy of our constitution to claim and assert our liberties as an entailed inheritance derived to us from our forefathers, and to be transmitted to our posterity — as an estate specially belonging to the people of this kingdom, without any reference whatever to any other more general or prior right. By this means our constitution preserves a unity in so great a diversity of its parts. We have an inheritable crown, an inheritable peerage, and a House of Commons and a people inheriting privileges, franchises, and liberties from a long line of ancestors.

This policy appears to me to be the result of profound reflection, or rather the happy effect of following nature, which is wisdom without reflection, and above it. A spirit of innovation is generally the result of a selfish temper and confined views. People will not look forward to posterity, who never look backward to their ancestors. Besides, the people of England well know that the idea of inheritance furnishes a sure principle of conservation and a sure principle of transmission, without at all excluding a principle of improvement. It leaves acquisition free, but it secures what it acquires. Whatever advantages are obtained by a state proceeding on these maxims are locked fast as in a sort of family settlement, grasped as in a kind of mortmain forever. By a constitutional policy, working after the pattern of nature, we receive, we hold, we transmit our government and our privileges in the same manner in which we enjoy and transmit our property and our lives. The institutions of policy, the goods of fortune, the gifts of providence are handed down to us, and from us, in the same course and order. Our political system is placed in a just correspondence and symmetry with the order of the world and with the mode of existence decreed to a permanent body composed of transitory parts, wherein, by the disposition of a stupendous wisdom, molding together the great mysterious incorporation of the human race, the whole, at one time, is never old or middle-aged or young, but, in a condition of unchangeable constancy, moves on through the varied tenor of perpetual decay, fall, renovation, and progression. Thus, by preserving the method of nature in the conduct of the state, in what we improve we are never wholly new; in what we retain we are never wholly obsolete. By adhering in this manner and on those principles to our forefathers, we are guided not by the superstition of antiquarians, but by the spirit of philosophic analogy. In this choice of inheritance we have given to our frame of polity the image of a relation in blood, binding up the constitution of our country with our dearest domestic ties, adopting our fundamental laws into the bosom of our family affections, keeping inseparable and cherishing with the warmth of all their combined and mutually reflected charities our state, our hearths, our sepulchres, and our altars.

Through the same plan of a conformity to nature in our artificial institutions, and by calling in the aid of her unerring and powerful instincts to fortify the fallible and feeble contrivances of our reason, we have derived several other, and those no small, benefits from considering our liberties in the light of an inheritance. Always acting as if in the presence of canonized forefathers, the spirit of freedom, leading in itself to misrule and excess, is tempered with an awful gravity. This idea of a liberal descent inspires us with a sense of habitual native dignity which prevents that upstart insolence almost inevitably adhering to and disgracing those who are the first acquirers of any distinction. By this means our liberty becomes a noble freedom.

It carries an imposing and majestic aspect. It has a pedigree and illustrating ancestors. It has its bearings and its ensigns armorial. It has its gallery of portraits, its monumental inscriptions, its records, evidences, and titles. We procure reverence to our civil institutions on the principle upon which nature teaches us to revere individual men: on account of their age and on account of those from whom they are descended. All your sophisters cannot produce anything better adapted to preserve a rational and manly freedom than the course that we have pursued, who have chosen our nature rather than our speculations, our breasts rather than our inventions, for the great conservatories and magazines of our rights and privileges.

***

Far am I from denying in theory, full as far is my heart from withholding in practice (if I were of power to give or to withhold) the real rights of men. In denying their false claims of right, I do not mean to injure those which are real, and are such as their pretended rights would totally destroy. If civil society be made for the advantage of man, all the advantages for which it is made become his right. It is an institution of beneficence; and law itself is only beneficence acting by a rule. Men have a right to live by that rule; they have a right to do justice, as between their fellows, whether their fellows are in public function or in ordinary occupation. They have a right to the fruits of their industry and to the means of making their industry fruitful. They have a right to the acquisitions of their parents, to the nourishment and improvement of their offspring, to instruction in life, and to consolation in death. Whatever each man can separately do, without trespassing upon others, he has a right to do for himself; and he has a right to a fair portion of all which society, with all its combinations of skill and force, can do in his favor. In this partnership all men have equal rights, but not to equal things. He that has but five shillings in the partnership has as good a right to it as he that has five hundred pounds has to his larger proportion. But he has not a right to an equal dividend in the product of the joint stock; and as to the share of power, authority, and direction which each individual ought to have in the management of the state, that I must deny to be amongst the direct original rights of man in civil society; for I have in my contemplation the civil social man, and no other. It is a thing to be settled by convention.

But history, who keeps a durable record of all our acts and exercises her awful censure over the proceedings of all sorts of sovereigns, will not forget either those events or the era of this liberal refinement in the intercourse of mankind. History will record that on the morning of the 6th of October, 1789, the king and queen of France, after a day of confusion, alarm, dismay, and slaughter, lay down, under the pledged security of public faith, to indulge nature in a few hours of respite and troubled, melancholy repose. From this sleep the queen was first startled by the sentinel at her door, who cried out to her to save herself by flight — that this was the last proof of fidelity he could give — that they were upon him, and he was dead. Instantly he was cut down. A band of cruel ruffians and assassins, reeking with his blood, rushed into the chamber of the queen and pierced with a hundred strokes of bayonets and poniards the bed, from whence this persecuted woman had but just time to fly almost naked, and, through ways unknown to the murderers, had escaped to seek refuge at the feet of a king and husband not secure of his own life for a moment.

This king, to say no more of him, and this queen, and their infant children (who once would have been the pride and hope of a great and generous people) were then forced to abandon the sanctuary of the most splendid palace in the world, which they left swimming in blood, polluted by massacre and strewed with scattered limbs and mutilated carcasses. Thence they were conducted into the capital of their kingdom.

Two had been selected from the unprovoked, unresisted, promiscuous slaughter, which was made of the gentlemen of birth and family who composed the king's body guard. These two gentlemen, with all the parade of an execution of justice, were cruelly and publicly dragged to the block and beheaded in the great court of the palace. Their heads were stuck upon spears and led the procession, whilst the royal captives who followed in the train were slowly moved along, amidst the horrid yells, and shrilling screams, and frantic dances, and infamous contumelies, and all the unutterable abominations of the furies of hell in the abused shape of the vilest of women. After they had been made to taste, drop by drop, more than the bitterness of death in the slow torture of a journey of twelve miles, protracted to six hours, they were, under a guard composed of those very soldiers who had thus conducted them through this famous triumph, lodged in one of the old palaces of Paris, now converted into a bastille for kings.

***

I hear that the august person who was the principal object of our preacher's triumph, though he supported himself, felt much on that shameful occasion. As a man, it became him to feel for his wife and his children, and the faithful guards of his person that were massacred in cold blood about him; as a prince, it became him to feel for the strange and frightful transformation of his civilized subjects, and to be more grieved for them than solicitous for himself. It derogates little from his fortitude, while it adds infinitely to the honor of his humanity. I am very sorry to say it, very sorry indeed, that such personages are in a situation in which it is not unbecoming in us to praise the virtues of the great.

I hear, and I rejoice to hear, that the great lady, the other object of the triumph, has borne that day (one is interested that beings made for suffering should suffer well), and that she bears all the succeeding days, that she bears the imprisonment of her husband, and her own captivity, and the exile of her friends, and the insulting adulation of addresses, and the whole weight of her accumulated wrongs, with a serene patience, in a manner suited to her rank and race, and becoming the offspring of a sovereign distinguished for her piety and her courage; that, like her, she has lofty sentiments; that she feels with the dignity of a Roman matron; that in the last extremity she will save herself from the last disgrace; and that, if she must fall, she will fall by no ignoble hand.

It is now sixteen or seventeen years since I saw the queen of France, then the dauphiness, at Versailles, and surely never lighted on this orb, which she hardly seemed to touch, a more delightful vision. I saw her just above the horizon, decorating and cheering the elevated sphere she just began to move in — glittering like the morning star, full of life and splendor and joy. Oh! what a revolution! and what a heart must I have to contemplate without emotion that elevation and that fall! Little did I dream when she added titles of veneration to those of enthusiastic, distant, respectful love, that she should ever be obliged to carry the sharp antidote against disgrace concealed in that bosom; little did I dream that I should have lived to see such disasters fallen upon her in a nation of gallant men, in a nation of men of honor and of cavaliers. I thought ten thousand swords must have leaped from their scabbards to avenge even a look that threatened her with insult. But the age of chivalry is gone.

That of sophisters, economists; and calculators has succeeded; and the glory of Europe is extinguished forever. Never, never more shall we behold that generous loyalty to rank and sex, that proud submission, that dignified obedience, that subordination of the heart which kept alive, even in servitude itself, the spirit of an exalted freedom. The unbought grace of life, the cheap defense of nations, the nurse of manly sentiment and heroic enterprise, is gone! It is gone, that sensibility of principle, that chastity of honor which felt a stain like a wound, which inspired courage whilst it mitigated ferocity, which ennobled whatever it touched, and under which vice itself lost half its evil by losing all its grossness.

THIS mixed system of opinion and sentiment had its origin in the ancient chivalry; and the principle, though varied in its appearance by the varying state of human affairs, subsisted and influenced through a long succession of generations even to the time we live in. If it should ever be totally extinguished, the loss I fear will be great. It is this which has given its character to modern Europe. It is this which has distinguished it under all its forms of government, and distinguished it to its advantage, from the states of Asia and possibly from those states which flourished in the most brilliant periods of the antique world. It was this which, without confounding ranks, had produced a noble equality and handed it down through all the gradations of social life. It was this opinion which mitigated kings into companions and raised private men to be fellows with kings. Without force or opposition, it subdued the fierceness of pride and power, it obliged sovereigns to submit to the soft collar of social esteem, compelled stern authority to submit to elegance, and gave a domination, vanquisher of laws, to be subdued by manners.

But now all is to be changed. All the pleasing illusions which made power gentle and obedience liberal, which harmonized the different shades of life, and which, by a bland assimilation, incorporated into politics the sentiments which beautify and soften private society, are to be dissolved by this new conquering empire of light and reason. All the decent drapery of life is to be rudely torn off. All the super-added ideas, furnished from the wardrobe of a moral imagination, which the heart owns and the understanding ratifies as necessary to cover the defects of our naked, shivering nature, and to raise it to dignity in our own estimation, are to be exploded as a ridiculous, absurd, and antiquated fashion.

On this scheme of things, a king is but a man, a queen is but a woman; a woman is but an animal, and an animal not of the highest order. All homage paid to the sex in general as such, and without distinct views, is to be regarded as romance and folly. Regicide, and parricide, and sacrilege are but fictions of superstition, corrupting jurisprudence by destroying its simplicity. The murder of a king, or a queen, or a bishop, or a father are only common homicide; and if the people are by any chance or in any way gainers by it, a sort of homicide much the most pardonable, and into which we ought not to make too severe a scrutiny.

On the scheme of this barbarous philosophy, which is the offspring of cold hearts and muddy understandings, and which is as void of solid wisdom as it is destitute of all taste and elegance, laws are to be supported only by their own terrors and by the concern which each individual may find in them from his own private speculations or can spare to them from his own private interests. In the groves of their academy, at the end of every vista, you see nothing but the gallows. Nothing is left which engages the affections on the part of the commonwealth. On the principles of this mechanic philosophy, our institutions can never be embodied, if I may use the expression, in persons, so as to create in us love, veneration, admiration, or attachment. But that sort of reason which banishes the affections is incapable of filling their place. These public affections, combined with manners, are required sometimes as supplements, sometimes as correctives, always as aids to law. The precept given by a wise man, as well as a great critic, for the construction of poems is equally true as to states: — Non satis est pulchra esse poemata, dulcia sunto. There ought to be a system of manners in every nation which a well-informed mind would be disposed to relish. To make us love our country, our country ought to be lovely.

But power, of some kind or other, will survive the shock in which manners and opinions perish; and it will find other and worse means for its support. The usurpation which, in order to subvert ancient institutions, has destroyed ancient principles will hold power by arts similar to those by which it has acquired it. When the old feudal and chivalrous spirit of fealty, which, by freeing kings from fear, freed both kings and subjects from the precautions of tyranny, shall be extinct in the minds of men, plots and assassinations will be anticipated by preventive murder and preventive confiscation, and that long roll of grim and bloody maxims which form the political code of all power not standing on its own honor and the honor of those who are to obey it.

Kings will be tyrants from policy when subjects are rebels from principle.

When ancient opinions and rules of life are taken away, the loss cannot possibly be estimated. From that moment we have no compass to govern us; nor can we know distinctly to what port we steer. Europe, undoubtedly, taken in a mass, was in a flourishing condition the day on which your revolution was completed. How much of that prosperous state was owing to the spirit of our old manners and opinions is not easy to say; but as such causes cannot be indifferent in their operation, we must presume that on the whole their operation was beneficial.

We are but too apt to consider things in the state in which we find them, without sufficiently adverting to the causes by which they have been produced and possibly may be upheld. Nothing is more certain than that our manners, our civilization, and all the good things which are connected with manners and with civilization have, in this European world of ours, depended for ages upon two principles and were, indeed, the result of both combined: I mean the spirit of a gentleman and the spirit of religion. The nobility and the clergy, the one by profession, the other by patronage, kept learning in existence, even in the midst of arms and confusions, and whilst governments were rather in their causes than formed. Learning paid back what it received to nobility and to priesthood, and paid it with usury, by enlarging their ideas and by furnishing their minds. Happy if they had all continued to know their indissoluble union and their proper place! Happy if learning, not debauched by ambition, had been satisfied to continue the instructor, and not aspired to be the master! Along with its natural protectors and guardians, learning will be cast into the mire and trodden down under the hoofs of a swinish[18] multitude.

If, as I suspect, modern letters owe more than they are always willing to own to ancient manners, so do other interests which we value full as much as they are worth. Even commerce and trade and manufacture, the gods of our economical politicians, are themselves perhaps but creatures, are themselves but effects which, as first causes, we choose to worship. They certainly grew under the same shade in which learning flourished. They, too, may decay with their natural protecting principles. With you, for the present at least, they all threaten to disappear together. Where trade and manufactures are wanting to a people, and the spirit of nobility and religion remains, sentiment supplies, and not always ill supplies, their place; but if commerce and the arts should be lost in an experiment to try how well a state may stand without these old fundamental principles, what sort of a thing must be a nation of gross, stupid, ferocious, and, at the same time, poor and sordid barbarians, destitute of religion, honor, or manly pride, possessing nothing at present, and hoping for nothing hereafter?

I wish you may not be going fast, and by the shortest cut, to that horrible and disgustful situation. Already there appears a poverty of conception, a coarseness, and a vulgarity in all the proceedings of the Assembly and of all their instructors. Their liberty is not liberal. Their science is presumptuous ignorance. Their humanity is savage and brutal.",Masterworks of Brit Lit,1997,"[97, 77, 80, 81]",4

Spur of the moment, I ball like Ginóbili, you bitches get D'ed up on
You mad at me? Go get mad at your nigga 'fore I put my sneakers on
He copped me this wrist game, now it's just us at the Knicks game

Oh yes I love her like Egyptian
Want a description? My royal highness
So many plusses when I bust that there can’t be no minus
Went from yelling crickets and crows
Bitches and hoes to queen thangs
Over the years I been up on my toes and yes I seen thangs
Like Kilroy, chill boy because them folks might think you soft
Talking like that, man, fuck them niggas, I’m going off
And coming right back like boomerangs when you throw 'em
With these old ghetto poems, thinking it's better for 'em
When they can let they thumb down from hitchhiking
Inviting niggas into the temple they call their body
Now everybody got it, had it, talked about it amongst they friends
Coming around my crew looking Jazzy, wanna pretend
Like you Ms. Goody Four-Shoes, even Bo knew that you got poked
Like acupuncture patients
While our nation is a boat, straight sinking
I hate thinking that these the future mommas of our chill'un
They fucking a different nigga every time they get the feeling to
I’m willing to go the extra kilometer
Just to see my señorita get her pillow
On the side of my bed where no girl ever stay
House and doctor was the games we used to play
But now it’s real Jazzy Belle

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
See what if you was a playa, real playa not no flaw
Having the very best of life: lobster, steak and Perignon
Smoking an ounce of weed
And every single day was personal FreakNik
Tricking these hoes in Polo clothes, life as you conceived it
But your conception, deception, looking into your eyes
I see your weapon and it’s depressing
They're digging up in your thighs, leaving deposits
Keeping your closets open, knocking your boots and drawers
Hoping to get you sprung like bail-bonds
Steadily calling me Antwan 'cause you thinking that you my lady
Bitch, don’t play me 'cause you’re janky
I wanted to hit that ass but me and the Goodie we got danky
So thank thee, for running that Southerplayalistic game
You was the only one to blame, a nigga don’t even know yo name
It’s a shame, you cracking 'em up and fucking a nigga like 2Pac up
I’m leaving these foes to be the flowers and wake don’t get me
See, I gotta be feeding my daughter
Teach her to be that Natural Woman
'Cause you’ll be Waiting to Exhale while you other hoes be Dumb
And Dumber, yeah, you know what I’m saying

[Verse 3: André 3000]
See me and ol' girl in the black-on-black 'Lac Northstar
Windows are tinted so that no one knows who us are
Talk bad about her nigga guaranteed to snap like bra
Straps, sticking together like grandma and grandpa-pa
In this dog-eat-dog world
Kitty cats be scratching on my furry coat to curl
Up with me and my bowl of kibbles and bits
I want to earl, 'cause most of the girls
That we was liking in high school, now they dyking

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Having no mercy for the disrespectful ones, some
Be hanging around the crew looking for funds, dumb
Deaf and fine, they be asking me all about mine
How she doing how she be, I know she’s sipping that wine
Behind my back they squawk like vultures
Off and On like Trends of Cultures baby
Hey he faking it like these sculptured nails
But they can go to hell and lay with Lucifer
'Cause they burning anyway, Big Boi use her and abuse her

257,If Tomorrow Never Comes,"[Verse 1]
Sometimes late at night
I lie awake and watch her sleeping
She's lost in peaceful dreams
So I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark
And the thought crosses my mind
If I never wake up in the morning
Would she ever doubt the way I feel
About her in my heart?

[Chorus]
If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her?
Did I try in every way to show her every day
That she's my only one?
And if my time on earth were through
And she must face the world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes?

[Verse 2]
'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life
Who never knew how much I loved them
Now I live with the regret
That my true feelings for them never were revealed
So I made a promise to myself
To say each day how much she means to me
And avoid that circumstance
Where there's no second chance to tell her how I feel

[Chorus]
'Cause if tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her?
Did I try in every way to show her every day
That she's my only one?
And if my time on earth were through
And she must face the world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past

Disintegrate niggas when enemy, dome shots like Kennedy
Slugs drippin' with Hennessey, got murderous tendencies

Crack fiends on the back streets
Where the tracks lean, where the needles lay
And switchblades, if you bitch made
Put chili all on your Frito Lay's

Where the cops meet, go bang bang
Leaves blood stains on that concrete

Luke is flatlining.

CLAIRE: Do you have defib paddles?

BURSTEIN: No.

CLAIRE: Shit!

BURSTEIN: What are you looking for? Claire, what the hell are you doing?

CLAIRE: Stand back!

Claire finds a hot plate and plugs it in. She throws it into the acid with Luke. There's a huge surge and shower of sparks. All the lights go out briefly.

The lights come back on, and Luke's heart is beating again.

BURSTEIN: That was reckless.

CLAIRE: Yeah. Sometimes you gotta throw the science out and go with what you know.

BURSTEIN: Okay, let's take this step by step and think this through. Once we get the shrapnel removed, his healing factor and cell regeneration should take care of everything else. But what's next? Temperature is right. Uh, we have to raise the pH levels so his skin reacts. So what else will break down abalone shell?

CLAIRE: Salt water!

BURSTEIN: Yeah. Yeah. Saline!

CLAIRE: Where do you have it? Is that it?

Claire dumps out a bucket of salt into the bath, which bubbles momentarily. Luke jerks but nothing else happens.

CLAIRE: Let's get him out. He has chills. That won't help him.

BURSTEIN: His temperature's dropping quickly.

CLAIRE: That's it. It's not the pH mixture that's the problem. It's the temperature. We need to turn it up. All the way up!

BURSTEIN: No, no! You don't know what you're doing. Did you bring him all this way just to kill him?

CLAIRE: Think about what happened last time. The temperature was the only thing that you couldn't control. That's what you said.

BURSTEIN: Yes. But Albert Rackham was a racist asshole. He was trying to kill Carl.

CLAIRE: Okay, well, maybe that redneck was onto something. Maybe the explosion is what did it. We don't just need to heat up that soup. We need to boil it!

BURSTEIN: You are about to do something completely stupid. I wouldn't be a good scientist if I let you do it alone.

They stoke some fires and turn some knobs.

BURSTEIN: :All right.

CLAIRE: More. All the way up.

BURSTEIN: It's really heating up. It's climbing....This is good. This is very good.

They get the surgical tools ready. Claire gets out an ultrasound machine. She gets ready to work on Luke while he's still in the acid.

She extracts the first piece and drops it in the tray.

CLAIRE: Okay. How many more left?

BURSTEIN: Two more pieces.

Claire gets another piece out, but Luke's vitals continue to get worse.

CLAIRE: I'm losing him.  I'm not going fast enough.

BURSTEIN: You're doing great.

CLAIRE: Got it.

The last piece is out. They stop and wait for a moment, then Luke jumps up with a scream.

BURSTEIN: Claire.

CLAIRE: You're okay. Hey, got you. We got it all. We got it all. You're gonna be okay. We did it. We did it. You're gonna be fine.

THE STATIONHOUSE

Misty is looking at her photo wall. She stops on a surveillance photo of Stryker.

MISTY: Who the hell are you?

A WAREHOUSE

Stryker emerges from the warehouse. Mariah is waiting outside.

STRYKER: You took your sweet time, Madam Councilwoman.

MARIAH: Why didn't you just come to me?

STRYKER: Power doesn't travel. First rule of business and war.

MARIAH: You have no real power without me. You could at least let Tony bring me. I got lost three times trying to find this damn place.

STRYKER: Sure, but then I would've had to put a bullet in the back of his head. No one comes here. Period.

Stryker leads Mariah inside. It's full of crates, presumably weapons.

MARIAH: So this is the cure?

STRYKER: That's medicinal-grade, heavy-duty RX stacked up right there. Most definitely. You wouldn't believe how expensive these things are. Untraceable, alien metal explosive.

MARIAH: You hit Luke Cage with one of these. He's still alive. If it didn't work, what's the big deal?

STRYKER: Well, you don't need to kill God with one shot to sell a weapon. You just need to make him bleed.

MARIAH: That's all well and good, but who's gonna be able to afford it?

STRYKER: What price can you put on peace of mind? Don't sweat it. The same Judas metal can be broken down for mass production. Each single bullet is less powerful, but now you can put 'em in a machine gun and let off a hundred of those bitches. Mass production is where it's at.

MARIAH: I'm a politician. I'm not a gun dealer.

STRYKER: Well what's the difference? Sell the fear. Those people need to look at that dashcam footage and ask themselves if the world is ready for bulletproof niggas that eat cops for breakfast. Black fear. After abolition, it's how gun laws got enacted in the first place.

MARIAH: You talk of laws. Laws are bureaucracy. The mayor can't even wipe his ass without three different committees to argue about the texture of the paper and to pick the brand. I'm gonna need time to sell the cops on this, even with the fear.

STRYKER: Ooh. Well, you're out of time. This shit starts right now.

A minion comes up with a pair of high tech gloves in a padded case.

MARIAH: What? I hate to interrupt your Isotoner moment, but this is serious. I'm out of time and then...?

STRYKER: A few illmatic deaths. Word of mouth spreads like wildfire.

MARIAH: No! Luke Cage must be the focus.

STRYKER: Oh, he is my focus. Always.

BURSTEIN'S FARMHOUSE

Claire is tending Luke's rapidly healing wounds.

CLAIRE: I've never seen anything like it.

BURSTEIN: No one has. A man whose cells can regenerate is a man who doesn't age. Do you know how valuable that is?

CLAIRE: Luke's the only one?

BURSTEIN: Yes. All the other subjects failed. There's a lot of work to be done. A lot of good work.

CLAIRE: How many more people will have to die?

BURSTEIN: They volunteered in exchange for time off their sentences. They knew the risks. I'm not a monster.

CLAIRE: I never said you were.

Luke wakes and sits up.

CLAIRE: Hey.

LUKE: Who are you? ...Just kidding, Claire.

A HARLEM PLAYGROUND

A cheerful day. A police officer walks by the park, greeting everyone he sees.

ALBINI: Hi, Ann. How are you?

ANN: Morning, Officer.

VENDOR: Hey, Officer Albini. Got those socks your wife wanted. Pink or red? One set or more?...Yeah. All right. Okay.

We see Stryker advancing behind Albini. One of those high tech gloves makes a humming sound as it powers up.

Albini notices someone behind him and turns around.

ALBINI: Can I help you?

STRYKER: My name is Luke Cage.

Stryker hits Albini with the glove. Albini flies backward into a pile of boxes. The camera pans up and Misty is ""watching"" using her special ability.

STRYKER: I'm Luke Cage! Luke Cage!

Cut back to

THE STATIONHOUSE

where another officer is interviewing the vendor. Misty starts to listen to them.

OFFICER: So that's what you saw?

VENDOR: Yeah, that's what I saw. Exactly like that. That cat with the hoodie punched that cop and he flew back, like, 20 feet, like he was shot from a cannon or some shit.

OFFICER: So, uh, this was the guy you saw?

VENDOR: I didn't see his face. But he laid him out. Then he said, ""Luke.""

OFFICER: Cage?

VENDOR: Oh, I just heard ""Luke."" Or maybe ""Duke"" or...

Bailey comes up to Misty and draws her attention.

BAILEY: Hey.

MISTY: Hey, Bailey.

BAILEY: What do you think?

MISTY: Well, let's eliminate the other possibilities. We know Jackie wasn't hit by a car or anything like that, and this guy over here talking to Chang isn't just making stuff up, 'cause that Luke Cage dashcam video went viral.

BAILEY: Well, there are no impact wounds. No glass, metal flakes or nothing. The impact is localized and focused. I mean, he was hit...

MISTY: Punched.

BAILEY: ...He was punched and he flew back over 20 feet. And the size of the hole and the punch is consistent with that of a human fist. And the punch was so hard, it bent back the shock plate of his Kevlar vest. Nanny said Cage?

MISTY: The nanny is saying she heard the suspect say ""Cage."" But let's think about this. A guy in a hoodie, punching a cop and then saying his name? If it was one of the goons connected to Cottonmouth, I could halfway see it, but a cop?

BAILEY: Don't forget, you know, he's on the run. You saw him fighting with us on that dashcam vid. Albini, he must've just spotted him and he tried to take him down himself.

MISTY: Jackie was never a hard charger. I don't see it.

BAILEY: Who else has that kind of strength? Look, in Harlem, black, wearing a hoodie...It's not rocket science.

MISTY: What about the backpack they said he was wearing, huh?

BAILEY: What about it? Luke doesn't wear one?

MISTY: Not usually, no.

BAILEY: So he switched it up that day. And what's the big deal? How does that eliminate him?

MISTY: The whole thing just doesn't smell right.

BAILEY: I don't smell anything.

They look through a partition to see a cop kicking a trashcan in another room.

MISTY: Right now, I smell rage.

The man who kicked a trashcan starts to make for the door.

OFFICER: Wait. Smith, Smith, Smith. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Smith.

MISTY: This is Harlem. And when a cop gets killed, heads roll. That's just how we do.

HARLEM'S PARADISE, UPSTAIRS OFFICE

MARIAH: You killed a cop! I know you did it. Now kids are getting jacked up by the police. What are you doing to my city?

STRYKER: It's not yours. Never was.

MARIAH:  Harlem is my birthright. It's mine! City council or not.

STRYKER: ""When justice is done it is a joy to the righteous but terror to evildoers.""

MARIAH: You quote the Bible like you actually believe in God.

STRYKER: And you speak to me as if you're not actually in the presence of death. Your way was taking too long. I killed two birds with one stone by sticking a body on Luke Cage. He's hiding somewhere in the blessed aquarium, so I turned the heat up. Old Carl he's either gonna stand up and defend his name or he's gonna run and hide, like a bitch. Either way, it doesn't matter. I've got the gun to take him out.

MARIAH: You're completely out of control.

STRYKER: And you're not a real politician, because if you were, you'd flip this. Get your Sharpton on. Make this moment all about you.

THE STATIONHOUSE

SMITH: I know the job, Inspector.

RIDLEY: Watch your tone, Jake. That's not what I'm saying. People are pissed. I'm pissed. But we can't let this get out of hand.

SMITH: Goddamn right. One of our own is dead. Cage is gonna pay for what he did. We're gonna hit the streets hard. We're gonna shake the ground. Smoke him out. That's how you find a roach. You fumigate.

During this speech we see clips of the manhunt in Harlem. Black men are, naturally, the targets of the harsh police action.

RIDLEY: You're talking about a community of people, not pests.

SMITH: Oh, come on, Inspector. I'm from the South Bronx. I'm 28 years on the job. I'm not some idiot who's afraid of blacks and Hispanics.

On the street, an officer throws a fleeing young man against a fence.

OFFICER: I said ""police."" Where's Luke Cage?

YOUNG MAN: Who? Wisdom is locked up. He in C-74. This is not his corner no more!

OFFICER: Not Wiz, fool! Cage, Luke Cage. Where is Luke Cage?

SMITH: This is all about Luke Cage.

RIDLEY: Look, I want Cage as badly as you do. He's at the center of three active investigations. But we need to be careful about how we pursue this.

SMITH: Caution is in the wind, just like he is. Our guys need results.

RIDLEY: Remember who you serve.

YOUNG MAN: All right, all right. I know one kid who knows Luke Cage.

This is a new young man, in cuffs. In the background you can see someone filming the altercation.

OFFICER: Who? What's his name?

RIDLEY: Do not light up Harlem behind this.

SMITH: The good people in Harlem have no problem with me. Just the assholes.

RIDLEY: You need to be responsible, methodical.

SMITH: That, we are.

RIDLEY: Okay. Do it right. No bullshit, no headlines. You find him, you take him down.

Misty hears the end of this exchange from her desk. Ridley comes in to talk to her.

RIDLEY: Anything on your boy?

MISTY: Chang's taking the lead on that one.

RIDLEY: I don't care. Luke is your guy.

MISTY: Look, I'm trying to figure out who attacked me.

LONNIE (from down the hall): I know where I'm goin'. Why you gotta be so tight Why is you holding onto me like that? Get up off me, man.

An officer is hustling Lonnie down the hall.

RIDLEY: Until Luke Cage is in cuffs, he's your priority, not your attacker.

MISTY: Thanks.

BAILEY: Do you have a lotto winner yet?

MISTY: We have the majority of the face. Lot of angles, but not a full composite.

BAILEY: I have a friend down in intel on the task force. Maybe she could help.

MISTY: Ooh! ""She""?

Cut to Lonnie in an interrogation room.

LONNIE:  I wanna talk to my mother.

DORSEY: Your mother? You definitely ain't no hard rock.

LONNIE: She's a lawyer. Or she about to be.

DORSEY: Well, if you haven't done anything wrong, you don't have any problem.

LONNIE: I don't. But you've got about five problems, far as I can tell.

DORSEY: Like what?

LONNIE: I was on my way home from school. Y'all picked me up with no PC. I just got back from school. Chess club. Fifteen people can place me there. And all I have in my bag is a half-eaten Snickers bar. I want my phone call.

DORSEY: Sure. After you answer some questions.

LONNIE: About what? I don't bang and I don't hang.

DORSEY: I'm looking for Luke Cage.

LONNIE: What about Luke?

DORSEY: You seen him?

LONNIE: That's my man. He's a good dude.

DORSEY: That ""good dude"" killed a cop.

LONNIE: There's no way he killed a cop. You're lying.

DORSEY: You calling me a liar?

LONNIE: Luke Cage ain't kill no cop. No way. Look, unless you charging me with something I ain't gotta say squat. I'm leaving.

DORSEY: You better sit your ass down! Luke Cage killed my training officer. He had a wife, twins your age.

LONNIE: Luke Cage ain't kill no cop.

DORSEY: Look you better start talking.

BURSTEIN'S FARMHOUSE

Luke is eating pudding.

LUKE: Your hands are cold...All you had to do was take the shrapnel out?

BURSTEIN: It's like replacing a burnt-out Christmas bulb. You repair the circuit, the whole thing lights up again. It's miraculous.

LUKE: It's no miracle.

BURSTEIN: Wouldn't you say so?

LUKE: Miracles are good things. What's good about me being here, huh? All those prisoners who died. Reva's murder. For what?

BURSTEIN: Immortality.

LUKE: What about those people you work for? Do they know I'm here?

BURSTEIN: No. They barely keep tabs on me anymore.

LUKE: I don't believe that. You're too valuable not to keep tabs on.

BURSTEIN: And you're not? Wounds healed instantaneously on the battlefield. Concussions, major head trauma, healed within hours. You're at the center of that. Cancer and HIV are next.

LUKE: That's a lot for me to think about. Right now, I just want my life back.

BURSTEIN: Well, take your time. I'll be back. Help yourselves to anything you like in the fridge.

CLAIRE: I don't trust him.

LUKE: Me neither. Reva's files.

CLAIRE: It's unlocked and unencrypted. What do you wanna know?

LUKE: Reva. What she wouldn't tell me.

CLAIRE: Maybe we should just take the zip drive and be on our way before he gets back.

LUKE: It might never be unlocked again. I gotta know.

CLAIRE: Which one?

LUKE: That one.

CLAIRE: ""Tiara?"" That's a weird name.

LUKE: It's that thing I took off my head after I escaped from the tank. That's my prison number.

The file turns out to be a video diary of some kind.

REVA (on screen): Regarding subject Lucas, Carl He's interesting. He's intelligent. There's a fire that burns within. Even when he's not engaged, you can always tell he's thinking. He's educated. He's not used to being incarcerated, but he always carries himself with pride. I think he's one to watch.

LUKE: Click seven.

REVA (on screen): Lucas' increasing loyalty to Squabbles is an asset. I think Rackham's assertion that Carl wanting to protect his friend will make him more willing to take part in the fight trials is accurate.

LUKE: Click 40.

CLAIRE: You sure, Luke?

REVA (on screen): Subject Lucas is beginning to unravel. He doesn't shave, he doesn't groom and he lives to fight. He's actually beginning to hurt people. Physically, by far, he's the best subject we've had. But it remains to be seen if he'll be cleared for stage three. Every single subject has died approaching that stage. If anyone can do it, he can.

BURSTEIN: You weren't supposed to see that.

THE STATIONHOUSE

RIDLEY: So what you got?

CHANG: They all said the same thing. Hoodie, Cage, and they saw Jackie go flying.

RIDLEY: No other leads? We need something. Chief is up my ass. Social media is blowin' up. This whole job has gone tactical. I don't want anyone from the Two-Nine getting caught up in any bullshit. Everyone in Harlem has a camera.

Bailey passes Ridley and Chang as he rushes to talk to Misty.

BAILEY: Guess what? I got something.

MISTY: What?

BAILEY: Willis Stryker. Facial recognition just made a match. There's also a sealed juvenile record.

MISTY: That's it? Why is it sealed?

BAILEY: It's past the statute of limitations.

MISTY: Okay. So how can I get into it?

BAILEY: Well, if you find a date and a courthouse, and there was some press, you might get lucky.

There's a ruckus from down the hall.

LONNIE: Hey! Stop! Hey! Stop, stop!

MISTY: What in the hell is that?

She and Bailey go to investigate. In the interrogation room two uniforms are holding Dorsey back. In the corner, Lonnie is bleeding.

UNIFORMS: Hands off! Get him off! Dorsey! Dorsey!

DORSEY: Where is he, huh? Where is he, punk? Huh? Why are you protecting him, huh? Just tell me where he is!

Misty goes to help Lonnie up.

RIDLEY: What the hell is going on? What the hell did you just do?

BURSTEIN'S FARMHOUSE

LUKE: We were trash. You knew no one would care if we were gone.

BURSTEIN: That was the whole point of Reva's therapy sessions. To separate the trash from the triumphant. To pick out those subjects that were most psychologically ready...to survive the process, Carl.

LUKE: Stop calling me that! I'm Luke. Carl died at Seagate.

BURSTEIN: What, you're still pining like a lovesick puppy for Reva? Please. She lied to everybody. That was her job. She lied to you about her involvement.

REVA (flashback): I promise I'll explain it all.

BURSTEIN: She lied again when she erased both of you from existence.

LUKE (flashback): Thank you for saving my life.

REVA (flashback): Thank you for changing mine.

BURSTEIN: She knew the stakes.You're...you're the future, Carl. You're a walking fountain of youth.

LUKE: My name is not Carl. I'm Luke Cage!

Luke smashes Burstein's lab equipment and throws a heavy piece of machinery through the wall of the barn.

LUKE: You're never gonna do this to anyone else ever again. How's that for stakes?

BURSTEIN: Claire. Claire, you're brilliant. You're not even trained. Imagine the things I could teach you. Talk to Luke. Tell him what he's throwing away.

CLAIRE: He's my friend. And that's why you'll never see him again. Or this [the flash drive].

BURSTEIN: You didn't say I would never see you again.

CLAIRE: Be thankful I'm not the one with the powers because I'd kill you if you did half the shit that you did to him to me. Not just ruin your barn.

AN ARCHIVE

Misty is skimming through a microfilm database. She stops on an article titled ""Son of Local Preacher Charged with Grand Theft Auto."" There's a photo captioned, ""Carl Lucas and Willis Stryker being arraigned in court.""

MISTY: Carl Lucas is Luke Cage.

UPSTAIRS

Misty goes into Ridley's office.

MISTY: Hey, I found out that Willis...

RIDLEY: It's gonna have to wait.

Mariah and Lonnie's mother storm in.

MARIAH: Officers. I am releasing these to the media in the next 15 minutes so they can see the contrast.

RIDLEY: Don't make a bad situation even worse, Councilwoman.

PATTY: You'd think a sister in charge would change things. But you're blue, which makes you just as white as anybody else!

RIDLEY: Luke Cage is a suspect at large for murder, a number of other crimes.

PATTY: Luke Cage may be bulletproof, but my boy isn't. Can't y'all understand that?

MARIAH: Patty, Patty, save your words. The only thing they understand is action.

RIDLEY: Mariah. Detective Dorsey has been arrested, suspended without pay. We are taking formal steps to charge...

MARIAH: No! Not enough, Priscilla. Not today. The death of that officer at the hand of that super-freak was bad enough. But to beat down a child? Means you're not doing your job. Come on.

MISTY: Patricia. How's Lonnie?

PATTY: Keep my son's name out of your mouth. He's at Frederick Douglass Hospital right now, getting checked out. Y'all gonna pay for this shit.

MARIAH: Until you capture Luke Cage, and apologize to the people of Harlem, we will...

Quick cut to Mariah continuing her speech in front of a big group of reporters.

MARIAH: ...bring this city to its knees. All over Harlem, young black and brown men are being slapped around by an NYPD too scared to do something about Luke Cage. And because young Lonnie Wilson, our brother just had the misfortune of knowing this supposed superhero turned super-menace he was beaten in custody like it's 1956. Any time one of Harlem's finest is killed, we all suffer. But let's make sure that that outrage is pointed in the right direction. I encourage the NYPD to effectively arm themselves to protect the public, not to harass young brothers and sisters, hermanas y hermanos, who are the lifeblood and the future of our community.
And I encourage that community to rally with me at Harlem's Paradise. We will discuss our next plan of non-violent action. Luke Cage must be found. He must be stopped. This must never happen again.

Back inside, Ridley is on the phone. Misty taps on the door and steps in while she finishes her call.

RIDLEY: Yes, Chief. Yes, sir.

MISTY: Do you have time to talk now?

RIDLEY: About what? About Mariah's little ""I Have a Dream"" moment outside? About all the kids getting beaten up by cops and the videos going viral?

MISTY: Something's off about this and you know it. Why the hell would she hold that rally at Harlem's Paradise? Shouldn't she be too spooked to even go inside after what happened to her cousin? Cage did not kill Officer Albini.

RIDLEY: Nothing settles down until Cage is in the box. We need to talk to him.

MISTY: And I need to talk to Willis Stryker.

RIDLEY: Who is Stryker?

MISTY: I get the feeling that he is connected to everything that's been going on. Cage, Cottonmouth, all of it.

RIDLEY: You'll need proof.

MISTY: I'm on it.

GEORGIA, ACROSS THE WATER FROM SEAGATE

CLAIRE: You swam that whole way?

LUKE: Doesn't seem as far away now. you ever hold someone in your arms, hear them breathing against your chest, and you're in one emotional place and they're in another? And you have absolutely no idea what they're thinking.

CLAIRE: It's called having a boyfriend.

LUKE: Reva lied to me.

CLAIRE: She helped you to disappear because she was protecting you. It couldn't have all been a lie.

LUKE: You don't understand. That woman? The idea of her...her smell...That was the only thing that kept me sane at Seagate. That's what's eating me up inside. I don't think I really knew her at all.

CLAIRE: You still love her.

LUKE: I love the idea of Reva. But not her, specifically. Not anymore. I should just go, you know? I should just turn around and walk away from all this shit.

CLAIRE: I wish you would've told me that, what, 800 miles and 28 hours ago? I could have got some sleep. We've come too far. We're both in this now. Together.

LUKE: Look, it's It's a lot for me to take in all at once. I just need a plan, that's all. Willis hates me, and I just need to figure out why. This was all so long ago. Savannah's the place where all those answers are.

CLAIRE: The past is present for him. Whatever wounded him has not cooled off at all.

LUKE: I trusted Reva and I was wrong. How can I trust you?

CLAIRE: I never back down from a fight. Even if you don't trust me, trust the fighter in me.

LUKE: Fair enough.

Luke very flirtatiously reaches into Claire's pocket to get the car keys.

LUKE: I'm driving.

CLAIRE: About time.

THE FARMHOUSE

Burstein roots around in the debris Luke left behind until he finds a hard drive. He plugs it into a laptop and retrieves the Reva files.

COLON'S GYM, UP AND RUNNING AGAIN

MISTY: Domingo.

DOMINGO: Do I know you?

MISTY: No but I know you. I've seen your rap sheet. How do you have time to commit crimes and train boxers?

DOMINGO: I guess you must have to be good at multitasking.

MISTY: Yeah. I like boxing. You know what Mike Tyson once said?

DOMINGO: Uh, Mike Tyson mumbles too much to say much of anything.

MISTY:No, Mike is great. He said, ""Everyone has a plan until they get hit.""

DOMINGO: Well, sometimes you have to take a hit before you can punch back.

MISTY: And I know how to counterpunch.

Misty shows Domingo a photo of Stryker.

MISTY: Who's this?

DOMINGO: You tell me.

MISTY: Look, I saw you with Cottonmouth. I heard about your little beef.

DOMINGO: Beef? No beef.

MISTY: All I know is, Cottonmouth dies, this guy shows up, and suddenly everything changes all over again. Who is he?

DOMINGO: You come alone? Why are you asking me all this?

MISTY: Because everybody is so focused on Luke Cage, nobody's talking about the fact that the heads of the Jamaican, Haitian, and Cuban crime families have all gone missing.

DOMINGO: I'd go to Harlem's Paradise. It's under new management.

Domingo turns back to his boxers and starts coaching them.

A CHURCH IN GEORGIA

CLAIRE: So this is it?

LUKE: It used to be. My grandfather built that sign. He founded this church after he came home from World War II. He was a Red Tail. Tuskegee Airman.

CLAIRE: Nice.

LUKE: He wanted a sign that was bold just like the tail of his plane.

CLAIRE: So what happened here? Why is everyone gone?

LUKE: I don't know.

They go inside the church, which is abandoned and seriously vandalized. Luke looks around and we move into a

FLASHBACK

to when the church was clean and well-maintained.

ETTA LUCAS: James, Carl needs you now more than ever. How can you be here for your community and every other family in the congregation, but you're never here for us?

Dana Strykerwalks into the frame and addresses young Carl

DANA STRYKER: Stay out of grown folks' business.

YOUNG CARL: Yes, ma'am. Mama?

ETTA: Carl, come on. I'm taking you to practice.

YOUNG CARL: All right. Let me say goodbye to Daddy.

ETTA: I'll be waiting in the car.

DANA: Mrs. Lucas.

ETTA: Ms. Stryker.

We return to the present for a moment, then back into the flashback. Young Carl wanders through some doors at the back of the church. He knocks over a stack of books. Dana bursts out of the room adjusting her clothing.

DANA: Carl.

ETTA: Look, heffa. You're not fooling nobody.
You're little more than his hoe, and we both know it.

DANA: He lied to me too, Etta. You think we're the only ones?

ETTA: You're through. And you're done.

DANA: Are you kidding me? Come at me again, bitch, and I won't hold my tongue about Willie anymore.

ETTA: You say a word, and the checks stop coming. He'll get pulled from Lieber Academy so quick, your head...

CLAIRE: Luke? Luke, are you all right?

LUKE: Willis Stryker is my brother. I never wanted to accept it, but it's real.

CLAIRE: They never told you?

LUKE: No, no. No, no one dared. It was all the little things. All the sideways glances during service. My mother hating on Willis, even after he won the city championship. All my dad's convention trips with Dana. He was always so protective of her.

CLAIRE: Who's Dana?

LUKE: His secretary. Willis's mother. He was two years older than me. For years, my mother couldn't conceive, and then one day, I I came along. That's why everybody called me the miracle baby. I hated that spotlight.

CLAIRE: They should have told you.

LUKE: Had Willis not framed me, I wouldn't have gone to Seagate. No Seagate, no powers. Reva would still be alive.

CLAIRE: How is that your fault?

LUKE: It's not my fault. My father started this whole thing. Willis hates me because my father hates the idea of him. What he doesn't realize is that my father never really liked me very much either.

CLAIRE: So where is this grand Reverend Lucas? Why does he get a pass?

LUKE: Doesn't matter. Diamondback is after everything and everyone that I've ever cared about. So it stops with me. I am my brother's keeper whether I like it or not. It's on me.

HARLEM'S PARADISE

CROWD: This stops now! This stops now! This stops now! This stops now! This stops now! Yes, it does.

MARIAH: Yes, it does. Oh, it warms my heart to see you here this evening.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Good to see you, too.

MARIAH: My cousin, Cornell Stokes was murdered right where you're standing, and it pains me to even be here. But it's necessary. Luke Cage murdered my cousin, and I am not afraid to speak out about it. The man is a liar, he is a menace, and as long as he is running around loose, hiding amongst us, no one is safe.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Ain't none of us safe!

MARIAH: Now, I know what brought us here tonight. The police putting their hands on yet another young black man. It's wrong. It is wrong. No doubt about that. But we cannot lose focus here. A cop was killed by this super-powered menace. And our young brother was hurt during their witch-hunt. Brothers and sisters our world has changed. We have new threats, new terrorists. That woman over in Hell's Kitchen snapped a man's neck because he was mind-controlling her. We got a bulletproof murderer on the loose in Harlem with his own twisted sense of justice, putting us all in harm's way. Do I trust the cops?

AUDIENCE MEMBERS: No, hell no.

MARIAH: Not blindly. We need protection from Luke Cage. We need protection from the other powered people like Luke Cage. He is the real threat! We need to arm our men and women in blue so that they can protect us. Truly protect us and never confuse us with those who are the real threat. You stay strong! I know you will stay strong, and I know you will welcome to this mike right now, Reverend John Pope!

Mariah steps off of the stage and speaks to some nearby people.

MARIAH: Emails. Make sure you get emails and a head count. Oh! I didn't know you got off work.

MAN: Hey. How you doing? - Because you are here.

Damon Boone is waiting for her. It seems like he catches her off-guard.

BOONE: Are you that desperate?

MARIAH: What do you mean?

BOONE: You're just using that kid to stay politically viable even though Brenda's still gonna force your crooked ass off the city council.

MARIAH: I don't know what you're talking about.

BOONE: You know damn well Luke Cage didn't kill that poor cop. Everyone knows he's the one who busted up Cottonmouth's...

MARIAH: Cornell.

BOONE: Cottonmouth's operation at Crispus Attucks and that $7 million in blood money that came out of your office. Cornell dies, Brenda and the rest of the party back off and your popularity surges. But I see right through you, Mariah.

THE STREETS OF HARLEM

Luke and Claire are back in New York. The bootlegger shows them a poster with Luke Cage's face that says ""MENACE.""

BOOTLEGGER: Yo, Luke. I won't say nothing. You're not going, are you?

LUKE: Why not? Nothing like a warm welcome from Mariah Dillard.

BACK AT THE HARLEM'S PARADISE RALLY

POP: Now, he calls himself a friend.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: He ain't my friend!

POPE:  But by his actions we know that this is false. Now, can you say ""false""?

AUDIENCE: False:

POPE: Say it again.

AUDIENCE: False!

POPE: Mean it this time!

AUDIENCE: False!

Misty comes into the club around the same time that Claire and Luke do. She's watching Stryker, who's watching from the balcony.

POPE: Yes! False! Yeah. Now Luke Cage has a lot to prove to us. What is he? Where does he come from? And will more come like him? And does his presence here mean that we will be endangered? Endangered by superhuman threats? Now, I want you to follow me this evenin'. From the bottom of your heart.
No, no, no, not from the top, or the middle. From the bottom of your heart.

Misty starts winding towards Stryker.T he crowd is chanting, ""This stops now!""

LUKE: I'm gonna go upstairs.

CLAIRE: You sure that's a good idea?

LUKE: Misty's gonna need backup.

CLAIRE: Be careful.

LUKE: Always.

CLAIRE: You're so corny.

The crowd is still chanting. Misty is slowly climbing the stairs. She passes Candace, who keeps walking. Misty reaches the place where Stryker had been a moment ago and he's not there. She proceeds into the office. Stryker speaks from behind her.

STRYKER: Hey, baby. You miss me?

MISTY: Put your hands where I can see 'em! You're under arrest.

STRYKER: Nah. Not today.

Stryker pulls out too guns and fires. One of them hits Misty's arm. Chaos erupts in the club. Someone pulls Mariah out of the building. Luke runs to shield Misty as Stryker keeps firing. Downstairs, a cameraman spots him.
CAMERAMAN: That's Luke Cage! He's here!

Stryker runs out of ammo. Luke picks Misty up and makes a run for it. On his way down the stairs some more minions catch him and try to shoot him. Luke breaks through the rail and jumps down to the lower level. Through the gunfire he jumps over the bar. They're pinned back there by gunfire. Luke wraps himself around Misty.

264,In My Bed,"[Produced by Salaam Remi]

[Verse 1]
Wish I could say it breaks my heart
Like you did in the beginning
It's not that we grew apart
A nightingale no longer singing
Its something I know you can't do
Separate sex with emotion
I sleep alone, the sun comes up
You're still clinging to that notion

[Pre-Chorus]
Everything is slowing down
River of no return
Recognise my every sound
There's nothing new to learn

[Chorus]
You'll never get my mind right
Like two ships passing in the night
In the night, in the night
Want the same thing where we lay
Otherwise mine's a different way
A different way from where I'm going
Oh, its you again listen this isn't a reunion
So sorry if I turn my head
Yours is a familiar face
But that don't make your place safe
In my bed my bed my bed

[Verse 2]
I never thought my memory
Of what we had could be intruded
But I couldn't let it be
I needed it as much as you did
Now its not hard to understand
Why we just speak at night
The only time I hold your hand
Is to get the angle right

[Pre-Chorus]
Everything is slowing down
River of no return
Recognise my every sound
There's nothing new to learn

[Chorus]
You'll never get my mind right
Like two ships passing in the night
In the night, in the night
Want the same thing where we lay
Otherwise mine's a different way

Can't believe you ain't here
Sometimes it's just hard for a nigga to wake up

It's like I feel empty inside without you bein' here

That they truly loved (C'mon, check it out)

[Verse 1: Puff Daddy]
Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin' on the block for dough
Notorious, they got to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone, we still a team
Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream (That's right)
In the future, can't wait to see
If you open up the gates for me
Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real, feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anythin' to hear half your breath (Half your breath)
I know you still livin' your life after death

Every step I take, every move I make

Memories give me the strength I need to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts Big I just can't define (Can't define)
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me takin' flicks

Coming, coming, listen girl

I'm whispering words over your shoulder
Oooh can't you hear
Before you reply the temperature rise
Then like that you disappear
I never imagined
I'd get so excited
Over a rendezvous
I'll be there in an hour still wet from the shower
I just called to tell you

1 - It's on tonight
The feeling's right
We don't have to go nowhere
Listen girl I'm coming over

Rub your back, massage your shoulders
I just wanna lay it on you

2 - Girl can you tell me what's on tonight
I'm coming to your crib
Have dinner by candlelight
And we gonna watch some TV
We gonna play your CD's
I'm gonna be on you
And you're gonna be on me

Repeat 2

I pray that you're wearing Victoria Secrets
Oh, that blows my mind
Now what should I bring
Strawberries I'm thinking
Or some honey for your toes
I never imagined I get so excited
So aroused by you
So click on the cable
I'll put on a slow jam

Don't you try to go no where

Where there's no one left (Buku, buku! Alla de massive)
But the very best (Klaka, bo bo, BDP crew, bo bo bo bo)
No MC can test (but one, one, one)
Step into a world, where hip-hop is me
Where MC's and DJ's
Build up their skills as they play every day for the, rapture
Yeah, what what
Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, KRS-One, rock on
Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, KRS-One, rock on

[Verse One]
I'm bout to hit you with that traditional style of cold rockin'
Givin options for head knockin non-stoppin'
Tip-toppin' lyrics we droppin' but styles can be forgotten
So we bring back the raw hip-hoppin'
Just like the records and tapes you be coppin'
Cop some breakdancin', boogie poppin', and lockin'
Tic tockin', guaranteed to have you clockin'
We only get better and only better we have gotten
This type of flow don't even think about stoppin'
Beware, the length of the rhyme flow can be shockin'
All music lovers in the place right now
That never understood the way that KRS got down
Yo, I'm strictly about skills and dope lyrical coastin'
Relying on talent, not marketing and promotion
If a dope lyrical flow is a must
You gots to go with a name you can quickly trust
I'm not sayin I'm number one, uhh I'm sorry, I lied
I'm number one, two, three, four and five
Stop wastin' your money on marketing schemes
And pretty packages pushin' dreams to the fiends
A dope MC is a dope MC
With or witout a record deal, all can see
And that's who KRS be son
I'm not the run-of-the-mill, cause for the mill I don't run

Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, KRS-One, rock on
Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, KRS-One, rock on

[Verse Two]
Everybody on the mic in the party sound alike
Until I recite, in black and white what's right
Let me take flight, my style is TIGHT AN GOOD
TIGHT AN GOOD, come is it TIGHT AN GOOD
Old styles I pass dat, slow down on fast rap
All in yo' ass crack, Cocaine? Don't pass dat
Conjure to ask dat, hyper type of flashback
I publish like ASCAP lyrics for hand clap
No past rappin', youth trackin', talent lackin'
MC's more worried about their financial backin'
Steady packin a gat as if something's gonna happen
But it doesn't, they wind up shootin they cousin, they buggin'
I appear everywhere and nowhere at once
I know my style is bumpin, even though some people front
It's the God of rap, you heard of it
The one that rhymes toward the sky givin airplanes mad turbulence
In rap tournaments, I reign permanent
Don't you think by now the number one spot I'm not concerned with it
The course of rap I'm turnin' it
Back to that good old fashioned way of getting cash money by earning it
No bogus hocus pocus, I bring back to focus
Skills if you notice my position is lotus
Now quote this, MC's are just hopeless
Thinkin record sales make them the dopest

I'm feeling it, feel the high that you get from the lye
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
I keep it realer than most, I know you feeling it
Cristal's on ice, I like to toast, I keep on spilling it
Bone crushers I keep real close, I got the skill for this
On my back the flyest clothes, looking ill as shit
Transactions illegitimate 'cause life is still a bitch, and then you die
But for now, life, close your eyes and feel this dick
Since diapers, had nothing to live for like them lifers but
Making sure every nigga stay rich within my cipher
We paid the price to circle us, success, they turned my mic up
I'm 'bout to hit these niggas with some shit that'll light ya life up
If every nigga in your clique is rich, your clique is rugged
Nobody will fall 'cause everyone will be each others crutches
I hope you fools choose to listen, I drop jewels, bust it
These are the rules I follow in my life, you gotta love it
Jiggy-Jigga looking gully in the joint
If y'all niggas ain't talking 'bout large money, what's the point?

Putting myself in a position most of these rappers ain't in
I'm living, the ill streets' blues got you hunger pang-in'
Nothing to gain and a whole lot to lose, you still singing, fool
I'm thorough, in every borough, my name be ringing
Warming it up for the perfect time to hit your brain, and
Ya feelin' it? To all the girls that bought a girdle to conceal my bricks
No doubt, they can vouch my life is real as shit
'95 South and Papi on the Hill and shit
And all the towns like Cambridge that I killed with, shit
And all the thorough-ass niggas that I hustle with
Throw your joints in the air one time and bust your shit
These fake rappers can't really know I'm loving it, you feeling it?

What, y'all ain't heard that nigga Jay hot?
The Cristals they keep me wet like Baywatch
I keep it tight for all the nights my momma prayed I'd stop
Said she had dreams that snipers hit me with a fatal shot
Those nightmares, ma, those dreams that you say you've got
Give me the chills but these mills, well, they make me hot
Y'all don't feel me, enough to stop the illing right?
But at the same time these dimes keep me feeling tight
I'm so confused, okay I'm getting weeded now
I know I contradicted myself, look, I don't need that now
It's just once in a blue when there's nothing to do
And the tension gets too thick for my sober mind to cut through
I get to zoning: me and this chick on the island and then we're boning
I free my mind sometimes I hear myself moaning
Take one more toke and I leave that weed alone, man
It got me going, shit

Have you ever all witnessed the ""just been hit with a dick"" stature?
From a nigga like me who licks it then hits in it after
All in your cervix servin' you some of this summer salami
Work up a sweat from passionate sex like performing pilates
Ghetto! I'm lex-er than steel when it comes to real sex in the pill
(Precaution) No step in this fill if you scared of catchin' a dilznick
Real spit or do you prefer lil' dick?
She said ""no I likes it nice and hard to bring the real shit""
And I'll be comin', comin' from around a corner
With a box of Magnums to put it on you
Backpack and Newports, a fifth of Patrón you
Never hear Kutt Calhoun's a loner
I'm not sincere, not me from the bottom of a bad
Motherfucker named Sascha Fierce
Drink, drink your Kool-Aid with a booty naked
Ain't nothin' but some motherfuckin' sex in here
I beat the koochie, I treat the koochie
I never heard a bitch call me a pussy
(Why?) ain't seducing shut 'em up quick
Make 'em cover up dick like she's a coozie
Tell 'em Kutt just what you like little mommy and we can settle up
We'll have you twitchin', feindin'

I love big behinds, call me your highndness
Heavens to Murgatroyd, I love when you're workin'
You're twirkin' that ghetto booty, even makin' suburban boys

Ghetto love
Girl don't keep me waitin' for that

[Outro: Krizz Kaliko]
I'm talkin about pole slidin', lap dance ridin'
Do something strange for some change if you're buying
But big strippers make big tippers
Show no thankful for all their booty you give us
For just a drink or two, she'll make it wink at you
Drain your change until she think you're through
The ohh she got your booty bopper
Oochie-wobble watch you while she callin' you poppa

I love bitches, thug bitches, shy bitches
Rough bitches, don't matter, you my bitches
Gold diggers witcha eyes on my riches
Can't knock your hustle for real, it's aight bitches
I'm game tight, see it all through the platinum French frames
With the French name, in the same night
Pull you and your tight friend
Lift your little dress like light wind, hah, then I slide right in
You know the whole repertoire, U.S. to the U-S-S-R
Sexin' in a Lexus car
Match wits with the best of y'all, the rest of y'all
Is like veg-etables in my presence, check it
Reminiscin' to nothin' you ever heard

Funds come in lump sums never ends deferred

Frozen wrists and it's flows that's sick
More 0's than you know exist, bitch who you wit?

Can't scheme on 'em, Roc-A-Fella got a team on 'em
Chicks dream on him, trick cream on him
Lose it when dudes think it's just music
Lean on 'em, flash green on 'em and diamond rings on 'em
Sexin' around the way girls down to miras
I'm somethin' every girl gotta have like Levi's
Chiquita, mi amor, see how raw
You can love me or hate me, either or
I'ma stay winnin', rock the custom drop Bentleys
Never eat at Denny's and party like Lil' Penny
Can he live? Trick or main chick but if she leave
Just as quick, Indian give, ha-hah
Now what I look like? Givin' a chick half my trap
Like she wrote half my raps, yeah, I'm havin' that

You know the move's major, never minor
'Cause when you a true player, they never find ya
We takin' trips abroad with chicks from afar
Down in the grill in the villa, gettin' iller
Never know I'm at the resort, readin' to Robb Re-pes-ort
Checkin' out this new wine, inhalin' the cork
Million miles from the puddles, the rainy days, the tussles
Reign in ways to hustle, so we won't get caught
Had beef of all sort but I turned it around
Chose my steps more wisely, I'm learnin' the ground
I was so gung-ho when I earned my first pound
Now it's million dollar deals, (straight) turnin' 'em down
Roc-A-Fella make or break me, 'til death do us
Won't be in your right mind, you ever step to us
Been there, when I was in my tenth year, went there
Then I realized that it didn't make sense there
Backtrack, show me where the cash at
And plus, frivolous beef, please, we looking past that
Y'all can gossip while we learnin' the world
Drop the hot shit, never returnin' your girl, it's on

I've been around for 20 some odd years
I learned a thing or two about love
Relationship after relationship
Both sides givin' up
I'm not a man that's gonna settle for less
And I don't wanna be divorced
I want a love different than all the rest
I want a girl worth fightin' for
But I guess one day we'll see

[Chorus]
But if it ain't that head over heels got my nose wide open
Kiss me through the phone babe, high school jokin'

Longin' on are my young buck days
Some childish things, I'm puttin' those away
I've seen a love in my mind that I'm tryin' to find
So I'm not wasting time on
Anything less than a love that's real

276,Fulton St.,"[Verse 1]
Found a body at the rest stop
Buried in the woods beneath
The garbage and leaves
Workers clearing overgrowth
Saw hidden in the brush
Just beyond the line of the trees
A jawbone and teeth
Winter into spring
On Fulton Street

[Verse 2]
And cities grow weeds
And cities grow
And cities keep secrets in the trees
In the shadow of a pyramid
And cities grow weeds
And cities grow
By the river and the covered bridge
All cities grow weeds
And I know

[Verse 3]
All the memories your dreams retrieve
You pick a dress out for the funeral
Hold a vigil in the field
Release lanterns at night
And I saw on the shoulder of the interstate
When I followed your eyes
When I followed your eyes
All the crosses for the accidents
All the photos and the flowers by the street

[Chorus 1]
Will I ever put flowers by the street?
Will I ever put flowers by the street?
Never needed to live and suffer through the pain
All the tyrannies of grief
If I ever do
Will I even have the strength to do anything?
Could I go and leave flowers by the street?

[Verse 4]
And I saw signs on the shoulder of the interstate
When I followed your eyes
And I saw lights fading every monument
And the passage of time
If I could just try, could I banish all the pain in you?
Give you everything you need?
If I hid rose quartz underneath the mattress
Would it help you nights
When you're struggling to sleep?
When you're struggling to sleep?
Will I ever be half what I can be?
Can I ever be half what I can be?
If you needed me to be anything
Could I even be half of what you need?
Will I ever be me?
Will I ever be me?
If I could take hands to shake you
Would you want me to?
If it shook you out of grief?
If I gave chase
Summers when you tunneled into nothingness
Would it bring you some release?
If I saw signs on the shoulder of the interstate
When I followed where your eyes went
I saw nights spent after midnight in a eulogy
That you never got to give
And I saw fenders bent hard on an oak tree
I saw sirens at the scene
I saw cigarettes falling in the tangle of machinery
Between the console and seat
And I saw hands reach
Car drift across the center line
I saw it all in my dreams
And I saw leaves hiding bodies
In the tree line off the interstate
But I've never put flowers by the street

[Chorus 2]
I've never put flowers by the street
If you need for me to be anything
I could be everything you need
If you need for me to be anything
I could be everything you need
Every monument
Every memory
And I've never put flowers by the street",La Dispute,1997,"[100, 90]",2
277,Naked Eye,"Take a little dope
And walk out in the air
The stars are all connected to the brain
Find me a woman
And lay down on the ground
Her pleasure comes falling down like rain
Get myself a car
I feel power as I fly
Oh now I'm really in control

It all looks fine to the naked eye
But it don't really happen that way at all
Don't happen that way at all

You sign your own name
And I sign mine
They're both the same but we still get separate rooms
You can cover up your guts
But when you cover up your nuts
You're admitting that there must be something wrong
Press any button
And milk and honey flows
The world begins behind your neighbor's wall

It all looks fine to the naked eye
But it don't really happen that way at all
Nah nah no, don't happen that way at all

You hold the gun
And I hold the wound
And we stand looking in each other's eyes
Both think we know what's right
Both know we know what's wrong
We tell ourselves so many many many lies
We're not pawns in any game
Not tools of bigger men
There's only one who can really move us all

And everywhere that my crew go
And every hoe that my crew know
And every show that my crew blow
You know we get down, you know we get down

[Verse 1]
Hey this is how we get down with no question
Trees in the V.I.P. section, Big Sun sippin' on French Connections
Dashin', decked in the latest fashions
Flashin', niggas spendin' tax free cash, ten G stash
Son leavin' the club scene smashed, hah
Ass in abundance, run with a sick type
Click with mics get in your shit life
So better make sure your shit's tight
When I bomb, shit is worldwide like dot.com
Known to rock swarms, get up in that ass like
Dong Strongarm in the place at alarming rates
Got a fifth and that's all it takes
For me to flip won't slip
Try to front on and get your fronts chipped
Runnin' chicks home in plush whips, get a duck sick
Let it be known we got a song that don't quit

[Chorus: Tracey Lee and crew]
And every hoe that my crew know
Like Tonya, Michelle, and Nicky
And every show that my crew blow
Like the Apollo, or BET
And everywhere that my crew go
Like Philly, New York, or DC
You know we get down, you know we get down

[Verse 2]
Yeah this is how we get down with no question
Run up in a chicken's midsection, boom I rock on
From marathons to quick sessions
Menage-a-trois, killin' your whole crew
With at least sixteen bars like MC's supposed to
A real MC, take you, to School like D
I'm Kool like G, in Rap, I use the mic, to rule like a pharoah
Dipped in my Nike apparel, (hah!) you know we get down
Bad to the bone like marrow chicks
Crack your boom, Tray gets played from the plat the greatest tune
Philly's in here, been here, lyrics they win here
Why did you go there?  I swear
RNF tears the things like that
We breakin' your team up like a salary cap, and it don't stop
Until I get the cream like Shaq
Seventeen mil annual, flammable

[Chorus: Tracey Lee and crew]
And every hoe that my crew know
Like Tasha, Yvette, or Sha-See
And every show that my crew blow
Like the Palladium or MTV
And everywhere that my crew go
Like Atlanta, LA, or Jersey
You know we get down, you know we get down

It's party time
Ohhhhh yeah, it's party time, havin a party, c'mon
(repeat 2X)

[Verse 3]
So, with no question, hey, lyrics get etched in
Stone destined, to be, y'all niggas Jonesin
A threat when, in the zone get protection
Duke the best in, my profession
When I ride loops like a stretch Benz, heads get laced
D-Dot, keep the chrome cocked, just in case
Tracey Lee rocks son I'm chosen
Whenever we got this party scene live it's frozen
Whoaaa, time to close in on those who be dozen
Not tryin to hear it, without wine and spirit
Shows continue to blow the venue
With flows that's sicker than influ-enza
Roll with a squad that injures pretenders
I'm pullin' your card, so surrender
Bombard your agenda, at last RNF stash
With more pitch slaughterin', so we be the new world order in

And everywhere that my crew go

Got introduced to the game

Chopping rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls trying
Ta turn into the black Frank White

We had to grow dreads
To change our description
Two cops on the milk box missing

Show they toes
You know they got stepped on
A fist full of bullets
A chest full of Teflon

Run from the police, picture that
Nigga I'm too fat
I fuck around and
Catch a asthma attack

That's why I bust back
It don't phase me
When he drop, take his Glock
And I'm Swayze

Summer break, my escape
Sold the Glock, bought some weight
Laid back, I got some money to make
Motherfucker

And now he pays the price

Timberlands on tight

Start up a fight

Rest in peace boy
You know it's all love

[Verse 1]
Who holds jurisdiction over my twisted thoughts?
And am I to blame for what's happened off in this game?
I'm do or die about my scratch but I know
This dope game 4 me just ain't the way to go
But I'm still there grinin' and winnin' just like the next foldin' paper
Thinkin' of ways to load another caper
It's a cold twist to know that I can slang all night
And slang all day but never have the courage to pray
Believe I know better but somehow I feel I'm lost
At the crossroads but am I scared to move across
Could it be what I'm drinkin'? It got me thinkin' like I'm thinkin'
""Lord I need help but I can't help myself""
Awaken to the sound of sirens, niggas dyin'
Kids in the street wit no food to eat
Prostitutes gettin' money in they only profession
But Lord I only got one question

Do G's go to Heaven? Cause I don't wanna die

(Will I get to heaven if I die tonight)

[Richie Rich]
And if I took a life or perhaps sold some dope
Would you discriminate upon my entry to the gate?
I need to know my fate 'cuz now my life ain't straight
But just look it the place where I live is oh so crooked
I didn't shoot that man but I watched him die
And saw the pain and the struggle in his eye and didn't cry
So when I start to hear the thunder
Are you takin' me under or is my sin just as bad as the gunner?

[Hook]

[Richie Rich]
[bridge]
For every time I walked by, and every time I got high
For every man I watched die
Lord I need to know do gs get to go?
For all the women that I ran through
And those that I did and didn't plan to
For every scam I ran my hands through
Lord I need to do gs get to go?

And if they get to go, when its time to meet my maker
Will he understand that I am only a man
Flesh and bone born to live and die in the zone
And gets loney trying to make it on ya own
And when my baby crys my intentions are to feed
And fufill tha needs of my one and only seed
And if I rob and steal let it read in my will
""Payback from tha ones that who fell victims to my guns""
On tha run but knowin I can't hide
Why do I feel tha way I feel inside?
Its like my soul is leavin me
Are you decieving me ? I hear voices, sayin believe in me
Is it you? I hear theres a man named god
That can fix it, when its twisted
I'm not sayin I'm all that bad but I can use a lil help
Cause at times I can't help myself

I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

They were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions
They promise to be

Still solo, Under Armour still Polo
No wire, on fire
My desire for fine things made me a liar, a shooter
Gettin' high feelin' like it's vodou
Nine lives, SK with the cooler
Makaveli in the 'Rari, still B-I double G, I, E

Pretty cars in the driveway
If you cut it then you sideways, double up, crime pays

I'm from where the streets test you
Niggas mix business and pleasure where the cocaine measure
The narcotics is our product
The by-product, you walk up on me, I cock it
New Mercedes as it peels off
Nothin' penetrates the steel doors, gang signs, see 'em all
I said my prayer as I'm countin' sheep
Never really athletic, but I play for keeps, do you feel me?
The mortician, the morgue fillin' with more snitches
We kill 'em and takin' their bitches, R.I.P
Chinchillas on a winter night
Black bottles when I'm feelin' like, you wanna know what winners like
And I'm never on that tour bus
Just a decoy for niggas, the PJ's for two of us
Ciroc boys down to die for Diddy
My niggas ride for less, keep it real, homie, made me filthy
Touch mine, until it's even: kill
Like I'm knowin' every heathen will, closed the deal with Steven Hill
We Magic City of the networks
Cut a nigga cast off, how my nigga net worths

Thought you lightin' my life but you bring in more rain
I throw out my sheets
Memories stained from the past, won't come out, I can't even use bleach
Alone for a week while you be out turning up
Shaking it for any guy that you meet
I'm calling defeat, fuck it you win
Breaking my heart and you'd do it again
Acting so sweet like this bitch have a twin
I swear that my patience so thin
Tell like baby you making me crazy
Hate calling you baby I'm fucking up lately
So focused on us got me wasting my time
Should have been writing these songs on the daily

You got me so messed up yuh
Eliminated my trust yuh

You keep your other girls
Until you settle down
Whenever you get bored
I will give it to you
Just the way you like it

[Verse 2: Mary Davis]
I...have never had a guy
Who has as many girls as you
But numbers cannot take the place of quality
I have no doubt
By this decision to see us through
And my love is so strong for you
And by your side I always will remain

[Chorus: Mary Davis]
As long as I can be your number one
You still can have your fun
Whenever you need love
I will give it to you
Just the way you like it
You keep your other girls
Until you settle down
Whenever you get bored
I will give it to you
Just the way you like it

Just the way you like it

[Bridge: Mary Davis]
If you...plan on loving me for a lifetime
It doesn't matter what you do
With other girls, they just can't change your mind
(Oh, no) 'Cause when you're tired of them
You'll come back to me
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
I won't tie you down
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
You can play around
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
'Cause you know where the best love is found
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)

Just the way you like it
You keep your other girls
(Oh-oh)
Until you settle down
('Til you settle down)
Whenever you get bored
I will give it to you
Just the way you like it

As long as I can be your number one
(Anyway you need it)
You still can have your fun
(Anyway you want it)
Whenever you need love
(Anytime, anywhere
Just for you, I'll be there
Anyway you want it)
You keep your other girls
(Anyway you need it)
Until you settle down
(Anyway you like it)
Whenever you get bored

Keep a smile on your face
Just the way you like it)

As long as I can be your number one
(Just the way you need it)
You still can have your fun
(Just the way you want it)
Whenever you need love
(I will give it to you
Just the way, just the way you like it)
You keep your other girls...

303,I Always Feel Like (Somebody's Watching Me),"[Intro]
Who's watching?
Tell me, who's watching?
Who's watching me?

[Verse 1: Rockwell]
I'm just an average man with an average life
I work from nine to five, hey, hell, I pay the price
All I want is to be left alone in my average home
But why do I always feel like I'm in the twilight zone and...?

[Hook: Michael Jackson and Rockwell]
I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me is it just a dream?

[Verse 2: Rockwell]
When I come home at night
I bolt the door real tight
People call me on the phone, I'm trying to avoid
But can the people on TV see me or am I just paranoid?
When I'm in the shower I'm afraid to wash my hair
'Cause I might open my eyes and find someone standing there
People say I'm crazy, just a little touched
But maybe showers remind me of Psycho too much
That's why...

[Hook: Michael Jackson and Rockwell]
I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me?

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3: Rockwell]
(Who's watching me?)
I don't know anymore
Are the neighbors watching me?
(Who's watching me?)
Well, is the mailman watching me?
(Tell me who's watching?)
And I don't feel safe anymore, oh, what a mess
I wonder who's watching me now (Who?!) - the IRS?

[Hook: Michael Jackson and Rockwell]
I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me is it just a dream?

I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me?
(Who's watching?)

[Outro: Michael Jackson and Rockwell]
(Who's watching me?)
I always feel like somebody’s watching me
I always feel like somebody’s watching me
I always feel like somebody’s watching me
I always feel like somebody’s watching me
I always feel like somebody’s watching me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody’s watching me
I can't enjoy my tea
I always feel like somebody’s watching me
Can I have my privacy?
I always feel like somebody’s watching me
Who's watching me?
(Who's watching me?)
I always feel like somebody’s watching me
I always feel like somebody’s watching me
Stop playing tricks on me
I always feel like somebody’s watching me
Why you don't let me be?
I always feel like somebody’s watching me",Rockwell,1997,"[99, 93, 90, 85, 80, 83, 74, 78, 79, 71, 71, 71, 71, 71, 75]",15
304,It's In Your Eyes,"[Verse 1]
It's in your eyes
The love you hide away
You can't disguise
The things you feel, the thing you say

[Chorus 1]
If you just call my name
Any time at all, I'll be there

[Verse 2]
I don't know why
The way you're falling away from me
I can't describe
It's how it feels, it's what I see

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
I look around, all I see is you
But you gotta tell me that you want me too
Look at me, you're all that I need, it's true

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 3]
I can't disguise
The love I wait for you to share
I can't deny
If you reach out and touch my hand it's there

305,No Diggity,"[Intro]
No diggity!
You know what
I like the playettes
No diggity, no doubt
Play on playette, play on playette
Yo Dre, drop the verse

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got at me, collab' creations, bump like acne
No doubt, I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch, a dog couldn't catch me ass out
Tell me who can stop when Dre makin' moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavor
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers

[Verse 2: Teddy Riley]
Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much grounds, got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind (wow)
I think about the girl all the time (wow wow)
East side to the west side
Pushin' phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash, stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down so I can win?

[Hook]
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up, girl
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, get up

[Verse 3: Blackstreet]
She's got class and style
Street knowledge by the pound
Baby never act wild, very low key on the profile
Catchin' feelings is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Herb's the word, spin's the verb
Lovers it curves so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You gotta pay to play
Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trump tight all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby, I can get you in my ride

[Hook]
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, oh yeah
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up, babe
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, get up

Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Hey yo, that girl looks good)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Play on, play on, play on)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (You're my kind of girl)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Hey yo)

[Verse 4: Queen Pen]
'Cause that's my peeps and we rolls deep
Flyin' first class from New York City to Blackstreet
What you know about me? Not a motherfuckin' thing
Cartier wooden frames sported by my shorty
As for me, icy gleaming pinkie diamond ring
We be's the baddest clique up on the scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake-ass broads?
I shows and proves, no doubt, I been diggin' you so
Please excuse, if I come across rude, that's just me
And that's how the playette's got to be
Stay kickin' game with a capital G
Ask the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be
Word is bond, faking moves never been my thing
So, Teddy, pass the word to your nigga Chauncy
I be sending the call, let's say around 3:30
Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity

[Hook]
No diggity, no doubt baby
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Girl, you got it going on)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Play on, play on, play on)
(Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo) I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Hey, ooh)
(Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo) I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Hell, yeah, babe)

Yeah, come on

Lisa in full effect (right)
Biggie in full effect (uh huh)
Tamika in full effect (yeah)
Blaze in full effect (right)
Ain't nothin' goin' on but the rent (no doubt)

306,Change The World,"[Verse 1]
If I could reach the stars
Pull one down for you
Shine it on my heart
So you could see the truth

That this love I have inside
Is everything it seems
But for now I find
It's only in my dreams

[Chorus]
And I can change the world
I will be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby if I could change the world

[Verse 2]
If I could be king
Even for a day
I'd take you as my queen
I'd have it no other way

And our love would rule
In this kingdom we have made
'Til then I'd be a fool
Wishing for the day

[Chorus]
And I can change the world
I would be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby if I could change the world
Baby if I could change the world

I could change the world
I would be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good

307,"I Believe In You And Me (From ""The Preacher's Wife"")","[Round 1: DNA]
I said, last time I was out here was Blackout 5
And for a while, I was telling Organik I ain't think that was fair
Considering I been in some of the biggest battles in this league and would've had the chain if niggas wasn't acting scared
But I did lose to Illmac 'cause I ain't have my raps prepared, excuses too wack to share
But all them Mac problems just made a nigga from the Apple care
Now I'm back, the fans say, ""Take a break""
I say, switch the flow, change the pace
He thought shit was norm’ and found out son a killer: I ain’t with Bates
He searched for the great escape
Thought the venue’s the safest place
But I’ll still sneak a star on the side: Bathing Apes
I don’t care if sir pen in his bag: Jake the Snake
I’ll share a couple points like great debates
The last dude ain’t make the plate
Fast food, let’s put it at Steak n’ Shake
A man’ll be prey with the mill’, so say your grace
Your combinations ain’t safe with me
He thought he got Deal and caught 30: now they yelling, “Take the plea!”
I got the ratchet-
I got the Roscoe on set: Jermaine Dupri
If that’s your girl, make ‘em leave
Or find a cookie on your BM: Baby D’
I’m in his crib, Kaepernick: I’m ‘bout to take a knee
Bring a end to his clique, then send him a clip before A.M., see
Y’all got DNA backwards trying to match A n’ D
The first 48 gon’ be a cold case if y’all see A & E
I’m into all type-
Let’s WORK!
I’m into all types of shit
My mind is sick
I’ll left-right his shit
Then a knife get licked inside his hip
And bet I won’t strike in the same place like when lightning hit!
His jaw I’ll double-tap like I liked the pic
Then make him bolt with the cannon: that’s a pirate ship
He don’t want the smoke, like he trying to quit
All that climbing amount to nothing: that’s a hiking trip
Every rhyme legit
Your squad dying quick
I made sure Ward family ran from this iron fist
I don’t need the hype
I don’t believe he nice
I’ll split his shit, then give him tips like he need advice
No adobo, you ain’t seasoned right
If he would cross me, Jesus Christ
Whoever you wit’ needs a bodyguard: I’m coming for you and the preacher’s wife
All them sleepless nights, it fucked with my mental, Ward
If I said something, it wasn’t by mistake, it’s ‘cause I meant to, Ward
Seeing dead bodies: that’s the type of shit I’m into, Ward
Hit you, then your men, too, Ward
Then peel with the arms over the body like a mental ward!
I get to checking Ward
I never been a friend of Ward
You gon’ need help from New Orleans by the 2nd, Ward!
I could say it forward or backward: either way, I’m ending Ward
Forward, backwards, they both end in “ward”
‘Cause in this first round, I just brought an end to Ward!

[Round 1: A. Ward]
He said he’d hit me twice like he liked the pic
Why it gotta come to this?
You wanna put the hands up.  Why?
It is like when Kaepernick take a knee, ‘cause I saw you and Chess and, all a sudden, you became a stand-up guy!
You see, battle rap is falling off, and I feel it’s time something is said
It’s lost its rawness, that emotion
Some would argue that it’s done for, it’s dead
These veterans, they don’t perfect they craft
They no longer have the hunger, the edge
And I got in it ‘cause of how you used to be
So, every battle, consider me gluten-free…one of the few left that don’t come for the bread!
WHY WAIT!?
Saga hit my phone like, “A., you worried ‘bout what D pens?”
I said, “It depends.”
Honestly, I feel it, too, deep in
And, Eric, you done lost your noodle if you think any of your dog paddles survive in this deep end
You’re in trouble with this number two: you need Depends!
So, was this matchup music to my ears?  Of course…Sweet Chin!
This a disgrace
Because, talent-wise, it is Sweet Chin Music
I feel it’s a step back…a knee-slapper…a kick in the face!
Bro, my plan for you is effortless
So, be cool, minimize the slander in your rhetoric
We don't need you
You’re a cancer to the betterment
I speak truth, the fans deserve better
It's egregious, you never give a top-notch effort
So, they sent me to destroy DNA like I tampered with the evidence!
Let’s talk about it
My king, he died on that big T
Eternal life was the care package
Now it’s official, rain or shine, so the twin Glocks you wouldn’t dare clap it
From Queens to Sauga (Saga) City, I get you drug out the room like DARE classes
I’m praying this top-tier came full of bars, ‘cause I ain’t blow up to get slept on like an air mattress
Now I know a lot of y’all probably caught the NWX members, but there was more to the rhyme
DNA’s double-stranded, so I also schemed, king, queen, twin, full, and air mattress to show how every head bored of your lines!
Bro, you battle every two weeks
Ain’t nobody put you on salary yet?
Of course not, ‘cause the wages you really earned was a reality check!
“PG Killer”?  Even your slogan is straight trash
Who brags about beating opponents that are supposed to be under their weight class?
Not me: I’m in the pit, where darkness stretches like limo tint
To show people with broken pain how to get they window fixed
You got religious questions?  Cool
Just don’t get loud on a crescendo tip
The game don’t stop here
We could take it outside like Nintendo Switch!
So, back down or stay in the background
‘Cause I’m here for a vision, impact crowds
You’re here for attention: a class clown
Make a decision: take pride in your craft now, or retire
‘Cause it’s jacked up you will take a nail in this blowout
But rather than live with despair, I could teach you how to fix a flat round!
I’m that nice!
They told me D hot
Watch out, he squeeze Glocks
I’m not ready, he’s not
Stop now, I overlap, a pot belly
If D talks a clean body, weaned off the Ox heavy
If we box, I’d tee off, bebop, then rock steady!
At the end of the day, when the dust clears, one thing remains, and it’s true
It took you 100 battles to get me…only took me eight to get you!

[Round 2: DNA]
I said, Blackout 7, the fans on the Internet should love this
But I bet the ones on the curb got bored
‘Cause I told Organik I wanted A…Verb, not Ward
Now everybody look confused like, “What I got in the Third? Not sure”
But in the Second, at any second, I bet the church may call
‘Cause they on to you, it’s the same tactics
He ain’t practice
On Friday, it’s fake gun gestures
On Sunday, it’s Saint Baptist
I never seen a great pastor tread the fine line on how he spray ratchets
But never let his four point: oh, this nigga A average!
He straight wack
Besides the Christian gimmick, that’s straight facts
Or we could get it shaking with the pound: that’s JayBlac
112, Diddy: he finna take that
Danny Myers: y’all gon’ see a bald head going through A hat
He gon’ learn, when I’m rappin’, I'mma hurt him with passion
The reward was death, so that earnt him a casket
Not with the snitching
If the phone tapped, the whole curb get to spazzin’
I’ll give A. Z’s
Queens niggas been about affirmative action
You cool with Saga? Just ‘cause you a friend that’s a friend of me don’t make you a friend of me
Blackout 7, but you won’t be the end of me
I ain’t feeling his energy
Let me guess, when you was a young buck, you turned to Christ ‘cause you saw him selling for ten a key
No, you were a nerd named Aaron Ward, from Knoxville, Tennessee!
But I’m on the same shit, different day
I’ll put his clique away, then watch him spin with the fade
You think I’m kiddin’? Play!
Fif’ a K, or I could just let the milli’ spray
I’mma have bullets run in Aaron like a busy day
Every bar is hot
They waiting for it like a barber shop
But I’m on it: I want the static, whether the problem solved or not
I’m keeping clips, then squeeze between the whips: parking spot
Nick' on the backstreet, I give Aaron car the pop
It’s NWX: we ain’t a crew, we fam
Shine showed him the deuce, he ran
It’s no biggie, a pair’ll rock him like the Coogi brand
If I’m getting to his team, and the toolie jam
Then it’s to the mystery machine: that’s Scooby’s van!
Leg shot, he paralyzed: can’t move or stand
Now, they praying for the kid knees (kidneys) like a Boosie fan
I’ll get this dude homi'd: he’ll find God if I use the can
Or I’mma get a new body behind bars: Gucci Mane!
It’s time to see what the rap ‘bout
Tap out, or these’ll let four ring like we in Shaq’s house
He had clout, but then took a wack route
These hammers Verb and Caustic: they known to back out on Blackout
It’s no way you gon’ beat me, nigga
And even though you ain’t a PG nigga
You just lost Round Two to the PG Killa
Time

[Round 2: A. Ward]
They say, in battle rap, the only way you are relevant-
(*laughs*)
-is for you to battle on a URL event
Well, I say, King of the Dot, make some noise!
You’re right, I’m from Knoxville, Tennessee
But you don’t know nothing about the path I been through
I was raised on Section 8
Every year, we took a coupon to a spot where they passed out gym shoes
So, missed me with all that struggle talk, ‘cause that’s not what I brought to the Blackout venue
However, I grew up with lines, rapping around the block
Why you think I’m so comfortable in a packed-out venue?
I swear this ain’t the action you want
I sacrifice to get my point across, like having to bunt
But not you, nah
Current event bar, Christian joke, sports jersey number attached to the pump
Let’s not forget about the other MAC in the trunk with the clip longer than Chipotle traffic at lunch
It’s so boring!
Miss me with them boring setups
“Something, something, holdin’ the nine”
You had 24 battles last year and no quotable lines
It’s like sleeping in on Clips’ couch how I’m holding it down
I pull strings, lights out: I’ll lower your blinds!
But for a second, forget about the crowd, and let’s just talk, DNA
I figured, since this is between D & A, we should probably abbreviate
See, this award you accepted, it wasn’t for the VMAs
You got it confused
In a hospital room - you not seein' A. (CNA)
This not your life, stop being fake
For a brand, why do you let a dark spirit control you like E & J?
You getting smacked down in this ring
You not raw! You more TNA
But you out here letting the heater spray
Shells hitting the ground like Easter eggs
But when Chess pressed you on stage, you seemed afraid
Where was the toy!?
When the round stopped, you ducked noise like a See n’ Say!
Bro, why you up here battling me?
That thought of Lyt had you seeking shade?
Speaking of Davonne, hey, bro, you can chill with the blaspheming ways
Or catch this 30, Day, fast like you need a plate
This hunger, Eric! Maybe you not getting the message
You should be amazed
But you not making it to Saturday night, live like Tina Fey
The rounds going over your head: we playing keep-away!
Re-arranged the game
I stepped in, kept the breathing straight
All without conforming material, keeping peace and grace
Persevering through the comments, trolls, bloggers, and even saints
To stand BOLDLY on a stage with NO FILLER, just heat for days
In front of you on pay-per-view, with a shirt on that says, “Jesus Saves”!
So, go ahead and curse the movement!  Charge up with it!
You told Loso you both believe in God
This is persecution to worship music
I guess we just lift our arms up different
That’s Round 2!

[Round 3: DNA]
Yo!
I like that your shirt says, “Jesus Saves”, but I see a lot of chinks in your armor
It’s time I show y’all that this kid’s an actor
‘Cause why would you join a group called Yellow Tape Gang when you a Christian rapper?
Usually, yellow tape comes after the murder
Now, I ain’t saying you ain’t with the right team
But I think them niggas made you part of their group so you could be the one that has to pray at the crime scene
Like, “Dear Heavenly Father, I hope 100 Bulletz has 100 bullets with a nice beam
I hope NuBorn throws enough punches to make this fight mean
I hope Bonnie’s on Wild n’ Out, but she’s on a dyke team
And Mike P throws enough Hadoukens to make a nice scheme.""
But you beyond fraudulent, but it’s no reason to hate you
‘Cause you fell into my trap, and I needed an angle
The fans doubted, they ain’t believe I could take you
I got at him to even son out so y’all could see that I’m able!
I ain’t speak first, then my research was reading the fables
The Last Supper, but with this mill’, I ain’t trying to eat at the table
You think Mike P’s your boy!?  It’s too easy to slay you
It’s in the Bible: I’m just waiting on P to betray you!
See, you claim you Jesus, son, but your hand gestures say you keep a gun
But all y’all Christians say it ain’t the same
I just feel like if your drive’s for HOV, then stop changing lanes
You treading a fine line
Go full-force and make a change
So, from here on out, don’t use God’s name in vain!
Just ‘cause I don’t say I’m Christian, I believe in God
Let’s set the record straight
‘Cause God was there when my mom got abused in a domestic state
Daddy died, we both was on SSI and Section 8
But when you deal with something love handles, you carry extra weight!
Y’all all say y’all Christian, but y’all milli-grippin’: it’s extra fake
You don’t get a pass for putting bucks in a round: this ain’t the collection plate
Just ‘cause you know the rule-maker don’t mean you can legislate
It be these type of niggas that get denied at Heaven’s Gates
And it’s time I school him, from start to finish
You got 100 bars a minute, but your whole style says you a clone: it ain’t hard to mimic
I’m the Gatekeeper, have to give y’all a visit
Hashtagging you Christian with shirts: you think God’s a gimmick
You preach the Word, I keep my word: our sponsors different!
LET’S WORK!  LET’S WORK!
All them verses from the Exodus, but can’t bring the X of this: our bars is different!
You wait ‘til Sunday, I can’t wait to son Day: our job is different
You pray with your Pops, I see prey with my pops: our fathers different!
I ain’t the same rappin’!
Ego got me in the game spazzin’
So, pride’ll make sure I’m Gucci: I do nothing in the same fashion
You, Loso, Street Hymns: think y’all cool with great passion?
Y’all keep thinking these Christians united, until I plain drag ‘em!
It’s Round 3, it’s getting hot in here
Canada, y’all know my slogan
(GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE!)
Hell no, get this wannabe actor the fuck outta here!
Get this Christian so-called rapper the fuck outta here!
Get all them lines that ain’t matter the fuck outta here!
And I seen that impersonation on Instagram: get Dizaster the fuck outta here!

[Round 3: A. Ward + DNA]
I don’t think y’all realize how easy that is
“We talk about cells different, I dial different
We run a different race, I walk miles with it""
I get on here and rap, and I smile different
(*laughs*)
Eric St. John, it’s finna get even more ruthless
And the exit? It’s over there if you need to go, bro
‘Cause you just not tight as me
View-wise, you do numbers
But, once they put that mic around my collar, I said, “Forget promo!”
Like, Organik, find us some judges
‘Cause when I say a bar, accent and all, they like, “A. must be cooking!  Geez!”
And mark my words: Cor’, in the end, you gon’ understand exactly why they keep booking me
Now y’all look intrigued
Probably thinking to yourself, “Son, that’s wack!”
Well, that’s cool
Do me a favor
Look at your neighbor and tell ‘em, “You gon’ think it’s fire when I- (RUN THAT BACK!)
I said, ST. JOHN, RUTH-less
The EXODUS over there if you need to go, bro
You not TITUS me
You do NUMBERS, but once the MICAH ‘round my collar, forget promo!
Find JUDGES, when ISIAH bar, ACTS-ent and all, AMOS be cooking!  Geez!
MARK my words, CORINTHIAN
Y’all know exactly why they keep BOOKING me!
Now, look at D!  Lock horns!
They here for my pen, not yours!
My stock soared, and I came in a 10…like holiday popcorn!
But they want performance over bars these days!
Well, I got two gats!
One starts to do a random dance move, and the other shoots back
Then I get to walking all weird with the chopper
Are y’all confused yet?
HALF these dudes lie through they teeth…AND YOU COULD LITERALLY DO THAT!
Bro, you smell like you haven’t BATHED since Blackout 5!
You’re lying. I took a shower earlier
This is straight facts!
And I recognize that wardrobe
I GUARANTEE you haven’t washed that since the Pat Stay match!
Y’all stop me if what I’m saying ain’t true
THIS looks like the kid in class that ate glue!
All right, let’s change moods
‘Cause, vers’ Loso, you said some stuff that made me cringe
Exactly how you rap: “The five’ll lift up my pants without axing Bundy!
You’ll get dissed in the Six without axing Cudi!”
I can’t reiterate how much you have a lazy pen
So, this is the part where I start to show that you lack fervor
And everything from me is gold and original, like rap Werther’s
Ranks or charts, I’m past proving that I’m raw
So, now, I’m shooting up them all like mass murders
So, here’s a little tip, like bad service
I’m here to stay for a while like black churches
I’m making veteran moves: a fast learner
And I’m a problem to these veteran dudes like flag burners
This new wave ain’t the type to attract surfers
Everything we put out dope, like trap workers
So, I could give a flying…FORGIVENESS if you a gat-squirter
‘Cause I don’t believe a round ‘til I see it like Flat-Earthers!
Who needs a pocket check when you can tap further
Into the soul of a bum who Smack nurtured?
I ain’t playing games no more like crashed servers
And DNA getting dusted for prints like cat burglars!
Let’s call a spade a spade
Who you know that’s nice and new to the scene?
The answer better be Aaron
The wrong stare’ll put two to your spleen
I told ‘em, “They need a Plan B? We could do it in Queens!”
I’m top pen in your town
SPAYED, NEUTER, BARIN’, PLAN B
I ain’t finna be on YouTube time: we are not kidding around!
Look, I am 8-0 on the scene, and the key is even higher
I put the capo on the strings
And I ain’t stopping until the case closed
‘Til I Django the chain off whoever on that throne in the ring
Put ‘em six feet in the dirt, on a pay-per-view stream that’ll work
And have J. Lo and Drake hosting the thing!
I’m that nice!
And I ain’t come to get personal with you
But I brought enough bars to bury you and any person that’s with you!

View from a balcony, pool lit up blue
Lawn chairs next to the ice chest
Stuffed two grams in the blunt that we just blew
Now I'm getting blown by a bitch
Who? I don't know her name
Gold chain hanging, got a few in the room
But I don't wear them out, only wear them in the house
'Cause I shine so bright, I don't wanna blind you
Who knew Yung $now wouldn't melt in the summer? It's true
Cold as a polar bear
Chilling with Stunna and $lick, I'm surrounded by tulips
Got me 'bout two clips
Got me 'bout two scripts filled up with Oxy
Smoke hovers all around my fucking body
I murdered this bitch named Oddy, yeah, I shot him
$lick got the shovels, and we digging all night
Pouya in the Caddy
Told him, ""shine the light bright"" 'cause I'm digging in darkness

Six bodies dropped, and nobody went to heaven
Block stay hot when I'm creeping with the weapon
Gotta keep the pills in me all because of my depression
City of the crescent, riding with a Smith and Wesson
Got a motherfucker guessing when I hit 'em with the blessing
Two shots to the dome, six shots in the chrome
All shot through your home, now that’s a crime zone

Drinking and thinking gonna lead to a bad decision
Déjà vu, I've been through it with you
Multiple times on many occasions
Contemplating vacating without you, I doubt you the one
I could be wrong; I could be sprung; I could be dumb
I could be dumbfounded, well-rounded
Plus the head game therapeutic
She knew that she blew it like Nintendo, you heard me
Some of y'all better curve me, my dick game army strong
My only hope is my song go on for long
This life ain't promised whether you accomplished
What you think about inside of yo apartment
You working for nothing you worthless, bitch

Yo, I'm smokin herbals 'til it hurts you
I keep your daughter way out past her curfew, hard far from commercial

Ferocious causing comatoses to collapse
So chinky eyed I see people waving on a map
I make it hotter than your thermostats
Bomb MC's with rough megahertz so call me
Funk Doctor verbal starburst, lyrical expert
Your boombox better form a union
Cause I leave your circuits overworked, word bond
Niggas front like they want it
But I be in the five hundred with E steadily getting blunted
Damn nigga you cool at what you spitting
So why you holding the blunt so long politicking
Huh, I ace them blunts with the technician of electrician
I don't got a pot to piss in but still spend my last on hydroglycerin
I keep it live no jive rolling Dutches

I smoked with a lot of college students
Most of 'em wasn't graduating and they knew it
You know the weed slang? Yeah boy I speak it fluent
I light your college dorm with my entourage from Newark
Bigger they come, harder they fall
That goes for, knuckleheads MCs, pussy walls and all
I lit my first L before I started to crawl
I got my ass whupped when I had my first brawl
But things changed since I was twelve years old
I specialize in wreckin mics and area codes
Now, PPP the kinda niggas that'll bug with ya
Smoke bud with ya, later on stick a slug in ya
Everything that's light green ain't the bomb bitch
I got different forms to make you lose your calm bitch

Think yo’ place, fam, Space Jam
An alien from the trenches came to get Patrick’s powers is the plan
No matter how high I set the bar, my method left them sour in the stands
Trippin’, Mike Epps, pimpin’
‘Fore I get to SMACK, he had to put Powder in my hands
So I run up, I put the MAC on these cowards
Strong aim, LeBron James
‘Fore the game starts, I’ll let it clap on this Powder

(*chokes*)

Time, man, time

[Round 2: Gunpowder Patt]
Let me guess…
You gon’ spit one or two haymakers?
Say a couple wild thangs?
Somethin’ ‘bout “you gon’ put Powder in the air like LeBron James”?
Or somethin’ with “Patt down (patdown)”, security, and weapons fly
Or Patt in the air like he tryna catch a fly?
I mean, we talked about my name
Let’s talk about Don’s, though
How you got your name, Don?
Did you make an M, got an AR...I know (I-NO)!
This shit I got’ll flip Don around...li’l nod slow
Yeah, that’s filler, but still punchin’
So what if it’s dry? GO! (Drago)
I mean, the shit be right there
He just gotta go get it
Niggas wanna live like the movie Above the Rim, then get goaltended
Everybody wanna be Birdie, then see fo’ pigeons!
Y’all see where I’m ‘bout to go wit’ it
If I was Motaw, he’s Shep, and this the end of that fourth quarter
Remember when he got the gun from the back?
A nigga like woulda been had it on him
Grabbed the four, and...passed the ball, and...wait ‘til he get back on offense
Then he get clapped off the court like Magic Johnson!
You see them Mexican bars took you far, but I doubt it could get farther
They knew it was gon’ be a fight...they just came to see who hit harder
But watch what you say, nigga!
You’ll get your shit clobbered, my fist palm him
I’ll beat the sweet out this nigga for letting his pen yard us (pinata)!
It’s two types of Mexicans in life, I’mma explain both things
You got the ones that get a lotta cocaine ‘cross the border…
And the ones that look like they bought a whole lotta cocaine
I mean, shit, everybody hit the block befo’
That don’t mean you made profit, though
It all could fall in one push...any nigga that sold a dime’ll know (domino)
But you paid for battles and got no-showed
If a nigga ever tried-
Deadass! I was there!
You paid for battles and got no-showed
If a nigga ever tried to zo’ me out some bread, he wouldn’t get to hear the end of it
That just show when he gets zo’d, he act (Zodiac) half a man: Sagittarius!
Man, when I look at you, I don’t see Don-
Man, dead body

[Round 2: Don Marino]
I heard you signed a URL contract
How the fuck you sign a URL contract, and get Don for some kicks?
Nobody ain’t told me shit
Yo, Norbes, me and son got it switched!
You really signin’ that? You’ll put ink on that bitch?
And if you got one, where the fuck my-
Nah, I’m Mexican: I never needed paperwork to sneak off with some shit!
I’ll have your bitch on all fours, she feelin’ this vato
She’s somethin’ I’m poppin’ on
I’ll stuff my jalapeno in her box like Papa John’s!
You said that? You said that?
So you know what this about
You can taste the nina
BAH! I took the words right outta yo’ mouth!
See, I might as well use your bars, so you could take this hearse ride
Against Rah and Short Fuse, you recycled material, committed the worst crime
I mean, if it didn’t light the room, or create that boom, then why reverse rhymes?
If it had no spark with Short Fuse, then why reuse, Gunpowder, if it didn’t blow up the first time!?
I don’t respect your grind!
Y’all think he’s the best bet!?
This your third PG, and Norbes gave you me, ‘cause he know I’m the next threat
You at WeGoHard saw what I did to Chess when that vet slept?
My abilities, Paranormal Activity
Now I gotta lay Powder down for y’all to see my next step!
So you put your trust in this cat, ‘til them shells blow
Chapelle’s Show: I walk outta nowhere, and drop a buck in his cap!
Spray his people
Think Ray Finkle, ‘cause if y’all get him to snap
Y’all gonna get mad at Marino when I fuck up the Patt (P.A.T.)
Don’t talk about the trap, like I wasn’t dodging the policia
Hand directly on the burner: I was flippin’ tortillas!
They raided my cousin’s crib, I felt bad for my poor tia
I had more Mexican grams at that table than loteria!
I get the fif’ in Powder like Chapo, fam’
I lean back with two arms: this my vato stance!
You think I cut grass or own a taco stand!?
Man, off the corner, I was savage with the elbow
Oooh yeah, like Macho Man!
Come on, fam’
If we was caught in a hard place
Before we’d pass “Go”, my holmes (homes) put down, and blew (blue) corners like Park Place
I had the chopper pointed down the whip: it’s a car chase
I hit the Powder before I go out shooting like Scarface
‘Cause here’s the taste
It’s plain (plane) to see we air hearts (Earhart), no Amelia
And I don’t use Uber Pool ‘cause they never have enough seats for the familia!
‘Til my vato pulls up-

[So Severe]
Ayo, Don, lemme get-

[Don Marino]
Nah, chill, chill, chill
Lemme slash his neck first

[So Severe]
All right, but lemme get-

[Don Marino]
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah!
With the blade, I’ll slice him up and stick him in a piano for the perks

[So Severe]
Well, then, I’ll just-

[Don Marino]
No, no, no, ‘cause I’mma bury him behind the church
And use his skull to dig up the plot and dirt!

[So Severe]
Well, then what’chu want me to do!?

[Don Marino]
Nothing! The Mexicans used to doing all the work!
YOU LUCKY I FUCKED UP!
YOU LUCKY I FUCKED UP!

[Round 3: Gunpowder Patt]
He think ‘cause I’m Black and he Mexican, we deal with the same type of race ish
Nigga, everybody love Raymond...everybody hate Chris!
African bars!
African bars, I can’t relate to this Mexican
You got a trunk on your car? It’s a trunk on my elephant!
BIG gun, gotta hold it like a speakerbox
Heaters cocked
Three pounds and a fif’ to ya do’, like a secret knock!
Y’all know what he look like?
You look like you not allowed within 100 feet of no school
Gotta watch how I approach you
Look like you got bullied in class all ya life…
Nigga, you was home-schooled!
And y’all really got me tryna rap with this dummy?
Nigga look like he went to the barbershop and asked for a noogie
The barber said, “Yeah, c’mere!”, gave the nigga a noogie
Don looked in the mirror...and paid the nigga money!
You in a fight with the wrong weapon
You look like you beyond stressin’
Like, like…
You work at Bed, Bath & Beyond, in the “Beyond” section!
Hold on…
You battled Chess, and think you buzzin’ now…
Beat Prez, then you somethin’ now…
He think he got a leg up on me…
Saw 6: cut it out!
What happened now?
You don’t know about me? Ask around
Silencer look like the wood tip on a Black & Mild
Thang smokin’, brains open
I’mma take two out ya pack: nigga, I’m chain-smokin’
Toss you and the murder weapon in the same ocean
He gon’ try to save his boy and see (buoyancy) he ain’t floatin’!
When I look at you, I don’t see Don Marino-
Nigga, I ain’t done yet!
I’ll be in yo’ crib wit’ yo’ bitch, while you not in there
Wearin’ yo’ house shoes, scorin’ 3-points on yo’ MyCareer!
No lie, this shit be fucked up in the streets
Wanna know why? (Why?)
‘Cause my OG younger than me
This nigga be tellin’ me what the fuck to do…
After I drop him off to fuckin’ school
Time
Let’s go, Mexico

[Round 3: Don Marino]
Honestly, I feel disrespected
You went from Staxx Rilla to Gunpowder Patt, tryna get detected
I went from Don Dollaz to Don Marino, we both got rejected
Now we both got accepted
It’s inspiration
It’s like immigration: we both had to change our names to cross over to get accepted!
But check it
Ever since Cortez, there hasn’t been a Spanish battler on the scene
I gotta ask about
I mean, I’m the first Miami battler to get a PG
But I’m always gonna back this out
The irony: Chino plugged me in with Powder so I could produce for SMACK
See how the trappers out?
No wonder they booked a Mexican
We good with numbers, but we known to pack the house!
So watch your mouth!
I came a long way from the tomato fields to the lime trees!
Now it’s bars, performance, them lines mean
So you right, it’s that pen shit, wreck shit with the rhyme schemes
It is forensics, ‘cause if I go ballistic and dust Gunpowder, it’s ‘bout to be a crime scene!
So just know I’m with the drama!
Napoleon Dynamite: I was out back, feeding the Llama!
It was a must, so trust
We was holding up signs, waiting for the ratchet to get off the bus
So don’t fuss!
I hold the pound for the clowns
You battled Skates, right?
My brother, you had to use that to get around!
I hold it down for my amigos, it’s lethal
My uncle got caught throwing bullets on cam’: he got hit with the Rico!
So mira, mijo, they say I’m next up
Well, that’s what they say, so I need the pesos
They tryna push a chico in front of the class: Vote For Pedro!
Mexican bars!
Trump finna get his sooner or later!
But until then, we keep looking over that fence like nosy neighbors
I heard you had to push that mary with the ratchet and get some papers
Ironic: I had to push to get married with the ratchet and get some papers!
Mexican bars!
They keep throwing dirt on my name, but I dug out the hope
Saw I.C.E. run in, get slugs from the chrome
That shit hurt my heart when I seen ‘em get drug from their homes
Now they’re back in Mexico, they’re smugglers
You wouldn’t believe what they drug out of holmes!
Mexican bars!
See, if they raid your crib, they’ll probably find everything illegal in the home
If they raid my crib, they’ll find everyone illegal in the home!
They send us back, it’s a danger zone
Grip the chrome
You might think I have a light point
But trust me, E.T. was the only alien that wanted to go home!
Mexican bars!
They had me losing to Chess, Prez, even you, and I hate the odds
I put on for my city, now I paid the squad
And we do got other work: landscaping, painting, construction
But you better pray to God
‘Cause if they let this Mexican into battle rap-

[Intro]
I come apart baby, but now I'm fine
I'm checkin' trouble sugar, moving down the line
I come apart baby, but that's ok cuz
Trouble man, don't get in my way

[Verse 1]
I'm just a hood nigga I ain't never had shit
Just a bad attitude and a bad bitch
Duffle bag full of tools and a half brick
30, 40, 50 grand in the mattress
Living on the edge just a habit dawg
I'm fucked up in the head I don't have it all
Ball like a dog push it to the limit
'Bout my business tryna keep from letting pussy niggas in it
My priorities is follow, God first then the fam'
Then the hustle, then the money, failure ain't in the plan
Satan on my heel he don't want me to advance
I tell him go to hell sucka catch me if you can
Shit I am who I am, fresh up out of apologies
Sometimes I ain't get in trouble, trouble got in me
Guess it follows me but I stays on my hustle man
Still the motherfuckin' man you can call me (Trouble Man)

[Hook x2]
Trouble man, always in trouble man
Grand hustle man, I'm the motherfuckin' man
Trouble Man, stays in some trouble man
Bank rolls, rubber band, you can call me (Trouble Man)

[Verse 2]
Drugs and rock 'n' roll, ho you know how I roll
Just left the crossroads, my soul, unsold
Refrigerated console, the curtains on my car door
Raw ho, caviar, sushi and escargot
Everywhere I go fresh to death and clean as a bar of soap
Getting blowed like trumpets in the wind in Chicago
God knows I'm hot as El Diablo
Wrist rockier than Colorado walk road
Also my flows I'm taking back although
My art's so Leonardo Da Vinci, Picasso
The rain gone come down on your head like tarp holes
I guess these other rappers that's cool as far as soft goes
Sorry Charlie party's over shawty shop closed
King home, bank roll on King Kong
Got these suckas in my scope with the beam on
Prayin' for my downfall you can dream on
Make sure I'm back in the Maybach gettin my lean on
Trouble ain't changed me, role model ain't me
Don't be angry now if I'm on the same street
Make a u-turn haven't you learned I'm, Trouble Man

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Weight on my shoulders, chose to squat with it
Real niggas say I kick it the same way Pac did it
Tell all them sucka nigga what the bizz is
Upset cuz they can't do they thang like he did here
Shit, another year another bid done
No chump change big bank millions
Ya, my money old but I'm still young
Them nigga lookin' for some drama I'm a give 'em some
No more beef a pimp will say goodbye to red meat
But cross a nigga path and you're dead meat
Remain on my gang time, after time
'97 college basshead, 99 dime
'98 have provisions on 285 flyin
Skip where you meet KP and L.A Reid got signed
Cut to the present and the rap game mine

317,"Watch Me Do My Thing (From ""All That"")","[Round 1: Madchild]
Y'all get excited about these mainstream rappers
Jumping on to the scene, but they're just here for a check
But this is Madchild, I'm just here for respect
So every time you see me on the stage
You're gonna see me at my best
A plan I won't deviate from, I hope that alleviates some stress
Now, let's work. I'm a white rapper that's a night capper
I don't like rappers that are light rappers that are like actors
I don't like watching battles ruined
Because they're depending on the Lyt factor
It's time to get on the right chapter
You're living your whole life backwards
You spit bars? I'm a raptor attackin'
A viking that throws hachets from that back shit
Ain't no match for a crazy blazing inferno
You're just one match lit
I'm a tyrant that spits visciousness, that's violent maliciously
You just came across the border right now
You've got an iron deficiency
You young fuckboy rappers, all afraid to go against the grain
While I make $600-$700K a year by going against the grain
And I am on a steady climb, a couple mil a year at least
‘Cause I’m not afraid to tell the truth, and I’m a fearless beast
I guess that's just my problem
I’m a goblin with a problem lyin’
With all them views you get
I hope you’re bringing in the dollar signs
‘Cause you and all your friends
Promoting killing kids like Columbine
I love life! I guess that’s just a crazy concept
That's a problem of mine
But that’s the thing, I’m still a hard rock, and it’s gobbling time
No Gucci goggles, but write lyrics that will boggle your mind
I’m going Prefontaine, you’re just jogging in line
He’s just a soldier, I’m a bicentennial
Five-star general that grew up my whole life
With gangsters, murderers and criminals
But I had to walk away from all that shit, now I keep it minimal
And make music raw as fuck
Still teaching kids, that’s being subliminal
I am nothing to fear, homie, yeah, you like that part
But I am something to fear, homie, I am twice as smart
For those of you that know my music, this is light vs. dark
What do Bloods call you? A crab?
Well, I’m a great white shark
I’ll put a fucking rope around you like I'm wrangling a herd
I saw that video of you tough guy strangling a nerd
If you’re a gangster, how’d you make it across the border, you young dumpling?
For four fucking years, I was banned from your whole country
I was gonna make fun of your stupid fucking face tat
But then I realized I got stupid fucking face tats
It’s true, I am crazy, I got a terrible mind
I’m stomping on a bunch of Grapes ’til I got a barrel of wine
I loved hip hop since L.L. was rockin’ a Kangol
You loved hip hop since Jamie Foxx was acting in Django
I’m actually Rambo, my friends know I'm a dependable G
And I’m still killin' shit; Expendables 3
I’m meticulous and filled with unpredictable rage
You a two face; John Travolta, Nicholas Cage
I’ll rip your face off, Canadian Adolf
I got nine in the clip I'll pop eight off
Stab you in the neck and wipe the blade off
I get paid, you got big homies, they get paid off
Think my height’s little? I’ll smack this black tarantula with a spatula, and still I’m a white widow

[Round 1: Daylyt]
I said, I know y'all tired, y'all tried to follow me
I done gave y'all so many What The F moments
That’s why they all screamin’ I’m not a G
But my analogy is for me to prove my right in this presidin'
I got y’all all screaming ""You gotta see!""
If I’m the best, to buzz, well, I gotta be
I know I gave y'all antics versus Pat, when I could've proved to the world no body could write as hot as me
And if I made any one of my core fans mad
Well, this match is my apology
I know most of the time, my skill get overshadowed by my antics, so most of my antics, I don’t need it
But I’ll admit, I got an addiction which is called attention
Which is a monster inside of me, starvin’
All I ask is that you don’t feed it
They say: “Day, you could be strong as Thor, bro
But your talent, you low key it”
They want me to write ’til I make the wizards think
Well, think lizard drink; so be it
I said, I’m gettin’ tired of these retired men who say they come back with that bullshit. Y'all feel he Jordan?
Well, this is when I make him fade away
With the same style, child, you done got put in the spot for the doctor to kill a kid; I deal abortions
This is when I stop the show, with Mop & Glo
See the flow shine with a dope line, like I’m into snortin’
They say it’s a slumber in the town
Clown watch me do my numbers with this round
Now, that’s Wheel Of Fortune
I told him, they write him my will of fortune
This nigga’s scorchin’, but you done got caught slippin’
Pimpin’, the flow too wet
This my go to prep, for the scene
Mean I make that body lean, like they off tofu yet
I’m fittin’ to catch the dry body, but I know you sweat
Don’t panic, Ganik, I owe you yet
Transcribe it, everything they read over the head
This shit is so brunette
I tried to bottle my anger, sittin’ in a hyperbolical time chamber, doin’ Goku reps of vocal preps
No duet, just another session compression
We plugged in the Pro Tools set
The pro who produce, I hope you flex
I’ll kill everyone in your family with no regrets
Ain't no damn higher writin’, vampire bitin’
You who I’m gonna give a hole to next
I'm finna show you ass, the fanny portion
I’ll wig on this bitch nigga; granny courses
You the best in your pack y'all
See I'll rip geeks in too many portions
I’ll leave child broke; Annie Courses
Thought I was finished and out of nowhere
I’m around your neck; I'm Randy Orton
Versus Pat Stay, I had everybody like
“Look what this dumb clown did!”
Now I’m back snappin’, I be tighter than Dumbfoundead
I said, I tighten up for the tights when I’m writin’ stuff
But they hypin’ up the wrong talent
I been slicing up the wrong parrots
Check this skill, nigga, I’m nicer than Charron parents
Child, we finna dirt you
Fuck around and get planted; we finna earth you
They demandin’ the scrap
Put hands on Child back; we finna burp you
There’s no G in your circle; he just a Urkel
Your whole squad snitch, I’m seeing the virtue
I ain't seen this many rats in one car since the KIA commercial
2013, nigga, this cat’s so real
Y'all know the fucking slogan: To the bat mobile!!

[Round 2: Madchild]
You’re a dead man walking, I’m a freak with perfection
‘Cause when I speak it’s execution by lethal injection
Organik got me rushin’, like a Soviet, but I'm top of it
‘Cause I’m sharp as a sickle
And harder than the hammer that fucking crosses it
I slice like a bear claw and strike like a rattlesnake; I’m the only battle rapper that can actually rap on battle breaks
They know I had them crazy rhymes
‘Cause I have an amazing mind
You always got a bunch of gangsters around you
In case it’s Daylyt savings time
You’re a mark, let’s face it
I walk alone and spit the harshest statements
Daylyt don’t mean shit
I’m underground, I come from the darkest basement
There’s a thin line between genius and insanity
We both walk in that straight tight rope
You straight right? Dope. Well, I’m Canada’s great white hope
I’m a walking contradiction, little clean motherfucker
‘Cause I’m nice as fuck! But still a little mean motherfucker
I’m about to expose this broad Daylyt in broad daylight
And face my enemy
You bring 40 Watts burning when it's daylight?
That’s just a waste of energy
When the battle’s done, y'all fall in line
And walk out like a centipede
When I’m done, I put my backpack on
And walk alone like there was ten of me
I saw that fight that popped with Math and Diz
That proved that you’re a total coward
But I appreciate your presence at the moment
I am solar powered
I’m from Van City, never saw you before, it was total showers
But now I’m in the States, I see you 9-1-1 exploding towers
This crazy Canadian is now an American terrorist threat
About to blow the fuck up and steal your light
That makes you very upset
You notice I ain't bring up antics, ass, or Diddy’s dick
Or say ""MmmK, MmmK""
That’s all been done to death, that's kiddie shit
I’m bout to spazz out on this trash mouth
I’m throwing rocks at his glass house
So tonight like every other fuckin' night, homie, ass out
Daylyt must have forgot this battle is called Blackout
You a black out, this cracker will smack the black outta ya
It’s too late for you to back out
You’re only dope ‘cause you grew up in a crack house
Don’t bring that MAC out, I still won’t back down to a MK
You can empty a whole banana clip
I’m an orangutan about to go bananas
On this panicking manic depressive
I will man handle this mannequin
You better work on your mechanics
Any more antics and you’ll be vanishin'
Plus, I ain't trippin’ on your little purple hanky
With bandana print
My life was like all seven seasons of Sons of Anarchy
But I won’t let you be a slave; I got you covered like a canopy
But at the same time I can’t lose, I’m a slave to my own vanity

[Round 2: Daylyt]
I said, first of all, you already ain't get what I just said
I said, you the first to fall, you ready for a seasoned nigga?
Well, some'll see all them will realize there's no way for you to be a winner, ‘cause today is the first of fall
I’m going in early; that’s the curfew call
Let’s see if you can heel up, like a church shoe clog
You’ll be injured when I air bud, I'ma hurt you, dawg
Y'all ready for the elbow? Let’s go
My point is what? You missin’, Child, damn, this a merc
Soon as Organic hit the kid jack
I told him ""Set off a Amber alert!""
‘Cause I told you I would take Child seriously
This shit should be considered as crib snatching
I mean the situation could get real foul
‘Cause if I steal Child, it’s guaranteed to leave the kid napping
You’ll get abducted without a sound
Off joy, that’s boss noise
Y'all still don’t get it right? Take child, kidnapping, Amber Alert… well, it's apparent you lost, boy
That’s ‘cause your style trash, wild gas, style spazz
They thought his pen was crazy, Brenda baby; Child trash
You are battling the messy can monster; the Chupacabra
You should bother
Too much presence for Child; I’m a true provider
Loose the collar, show up to your crib
Like, ""Y'all wanna see what I do to toddlers?""
I’ll beat the dog shit out of Child; I’m an abusive father
See, this shit ain't fair. It’s the Leaf versus the Cali state bear
They say ""You should watch Child.""
I reply ""Do you really think Day care?""
Baby sit, you a faggot mark
You would never let the 'matic spark
Y'all shoot, it’s John Q; Child, you just don’t have the heart
To be a real nigga. I mean, Child, you in disguise
You soft as a Teletubby, son – what, y'all ain't catch that?
I said I’ll put Child in the sky, like the Teletubbies sun
You better tell your buddies run, ‘cause in one of your songs you said you was in a drive by, with a wild Glock
Nigga you was in the backseat
Havin’ trouble with the child lock
Plan A was my apology. I told myself
If that don’t work, I’ll be good; I know for a fact that if Plan A don’t kill Child, then Plan B would. To the Batmobile!

[Round 3: Madchild]
I am Thor with the war hammer and a black BaxWar banner
You’re Spawn and Bruce Wayne?
I am David Banner with poor manners
I am also three characters, Silver Surfer, I absorb planets
Watched your battles
Shit put me to sleep, like I took four Xanax
Dog, you know how much fuckin' pussy I gave up to watch all these battles? It’s fucking retarded, dude
Silver tongued devil spittin' fire, like I am Godzilla
That’s five super heroes, from two really ill and odd villains
I’m not chillin’, I’m killin’, I’m shadowboxing with Satan, noobie
I work with Todd McFarlane
But saw Spawn, I fucking hate the movie
I’m Evel Knievel, you got a feeble cerebral, with a divaish ego
I’m Canadian, right? So tonight, just leave it to beaver
Oh ok, I won’t talk about you being a gay bastard
Doing battles with a slave master
You will cave faster than eight ratchets
Putting you in a grave casket
I’ll send flowers and a grape basket
No one crying for you like 2Pac, everybody already way past it
The shit you make up, it is Maybelline
Half my shit is make belief
I’m a staple like the maple leaf
Stitched on to the Toronto Maple Leafs
You’re a grape I eat, I’m a hawk, you’re the snake beneath
I could break your teeth. I feel like a masked man standing on the planet of the apes it seems
It’s a fact, it’s not an act
Our lives been filled with agonizing terror
It's an error to call him faggot
But this faggot should not be antagonizing terror
This dragon’s eyes are magnifying, clearer looking in the mirror
My second trick, I'll make another battle rapper disappear
My vision, it is crystal clear, let’s compare the end of fiscal years
I will physically tear your heart out of your chest, make it visible here
Still pumping rapidly, blood dripping down my sweaty palms
My machete’s long
You always stretch like Armstrong
To rock steady, to make songs, like your arm's strong, steady but you’re not ready
I’m a lot better, I’m a hot spitter, you’re a prop getter
I’m the top wizard, you’re a lot lizard
Get it? Lot lizard? Sucking cock in every fucking truck that stop to make his knot bigger
You ain't hot ni— aww I can’t say that word
I will rock ni— aww I can’t say that word
You went from nothing, to a total fuckin retard
But that got you on the playing field
But I’m the sickest rapper in here and do not need any Day quill
Enough is enough, it’s time to move on and look for some new concepts
I’m a constant reminder that monsters will find you
And I am the new bomb threat
How is it that I’m a Gulf Iraq war and Vietnam vet?
Meaning I’m a veteran of the new school, because lyrically I’m complex
Superior, but I don't have a complex. It’s complex
Demons fighting angels, kids they feel like inner conflicts
And I’m not trying to be a dick and I’m not saying you’ve had your palms read
But half your friends are gonna end up dead, or end up convicts
Cuz half my friends are dead now, the other half are convicts
Some of them are millionaires, just chillin' on some calm shit
But that’s a small percentage, that gon' make it past the finish line
But fuck it I’ll be Popeye, now it’s eat a can of spinach time
East indian killers, Asian triad gangs, and 1 percenters
Trust me this is not a topic concept that you want to enter
I grew up with organized crime, actual tactical assassins and mass murderers
You grew up with drive-bys, crack dealers, and cat burglars
I grew up with body snatchers, home invasions, sociopaths and kidnapping
When you talk about 'I’m reppin’ for my hood' that’s little kid rapping
You fucking clown, if street battle rappers shot guns as much as these street battle rappers said, guess what?
By now there wouldn’t be a single fucking battle rapper left
I said if y'all really killers, there wouldn’t be no battlers left
So it’s hard for light to shine, when he's standing right beside the shadow of death
I said plus guns are legal in America, think about it
Moms have them in their purses, guns are legal in America
So all of them bars are out of season
Cuz when we got straps in Canada, we got them for a reason!


[Round 3: Daylyt]
I say yo, this the round where I got em screaming that 'nigga’s bars is nuts'
Hey, this is my biggest payday, shit
Everything in front of me get plain crashed; better call in they mayday biz
Put this in reverse dog, you battling a god
That’s why they pray, they say 'hey, you seen that new shit that Day Day did?'
I came to melee wigs. I’m bout to do child badder than Bébé Kids
They wonder if homie gonna spit off
I’ll pull up with lines like I’m slowly on a dip pole
Soon as he step to the front he defeated like homie on his tip toes
I sidestep him, but I’m the Ginóbili of this shit oh
Guaranteed to hit the shot, I'm Kobe on a pick roll
I’ll snap on every round that hit the board; I'm a hungry hungry hippo
I’ll leave this pussy wet if I find him in the G-spot
I had Dots following your tail, like they following a peacock
I put hands on his mouth, we tried to give him beat box
I'll put the pump to his tongue, we tryin' to give him Reeboks
You still want the problems? Then I'ma give em street docs
See these pushed back; I tried to give him Detox
You got options, you could get the llama, or the heat Glock
Here is my handle, here is my spout; I’m a little teapot!
I said you better be afraid, cuz I got a hella crazy llama
That bitch hit everybody in the room, like Skelly baby mama
That Pat Stay battle, I told y'all I got a plan
Now I’m on stage armed with more neat-o lines than Hollohan
But it's the reason Bishop, that’s why they passing me checks
Y'all made me battle another washed up ass rapper
With that stiff ass Cassidy neck
I bet $35.00 you can’t do this… (puts chin over shoulder)
(Madchild tries to do it)
No no no no no no. Get your chin over your shoulder... not happening!
Yea real nigga, y'all know I write
If one of your mans get to trippin'
I’m off the stage with my arsenal, like the Showwoutt fight
2015, I told y'all I got this one
You win some, and you lose some but you live to see another day…

Banana clip is a paperweight, paper mate

Keep it one hunnit, homies, home is where the homies
Home is where the homies got your back

That's how I get mine, that's how I get it

[Verse 2: Daveed Diggs]
Hustlin' is a habit, so they say
This is for the G's who wasn't trippin' and never knew any other way
Other ways of gettin' money, not many do not require
A degree of separation from the streets you gettin' paid in
In which the degree of difficulty is extraordinarily high
And she high while doin' it so see why
Somebody who isn't from it might not understand
How you body a body in other words (how I could just kill a man)
And still a gram is a gram and nobody is Instagramin'
They killin' on Cypress Hill and they still is squeezin' the hammers
Police is beyond the scanners, these some obsequious bandits
And brandishin' flags of function
You fuck a figure, it's fashion then flash on a motherfucker
You fuckin' seeing the passion, forgetting the hunger
This the jungle, time to get active and crack it
So acrobatic, it'll flip in a sec, but set's up and no second guessing
Here in the street, people sweating for the money

[Hook: Mariel Jacoda]
Here when they turn on the street lights
Hustle 'til they cut 'em off, that's the street life

[Verse 3: Daveed Diggs]
No time for wifey's babies or other collateral damage
Checking for snitches, they be the ones order tacos in Spanish
Always thinking that they blendin' in, but then sending them telegrams
To the rollers, they bitches, not meaning feminine
Meaning, fuck it, ain't no explaining, get the fuck up and push cocaine
All these fuckers gon' sleep all day
But if you suck up when one of you step up to these bucks
Knock if you lacing up them chucks, no Taylor Gangin'
This shit is grimy and dirty, clothes stankin' while you slangin'
Get up out to the blacktop, backpack for the crack rock
Take shot at the cops at a spot where they knock a neighborhood watch
Watch him, learn the code if them eyes are closed
That means he sleeping on his feet and been out in the cold
And if he flashin' the gold
He either new or want action and got back up on the toes
Study all of your fractions, get up on the honor roll
Roll the marijuana then flip the hoodie up and get ghost

[Hook: Mariel Jacoda]

Think you can outrun these-
Nigga, you wanna live Ricky life?
Cause with this aim, I don't miss
Facts, pussy...Mickey wife
What you gon' do?
I'll make your jaw lean
Turn your life to a Saw scene
Head shot ya offspring
Red dots all over his face...now he Rosenberg Rawsteen!
But you the guardian of the Cave, right?
I still regard you as a sucka
.38 Special, I could be in the Olympics...(*smack*) with this retarded muhfucka!
I don't care if y'all 30 deep, it's still 30 actors
Get caught right in ya chest like Bill had on his jersey backwards!
Fuck Raw!
OK, let's turn up
Raw pussy: I ain't talkin' 'bout the best feelin'
Head spinnin', left his post traumatic like a vet symptom
We beef today? It better be USDA: fuck Raw!
I'm a slick puller
For the snow, man, I'll have you lickin' blood, Raw!
Why you be actin' so tough, knowin' you got that ho smell?
Nitty got up in Roc face...
Nigga, oh, well!
Comin' to the front like you gon' do somethin'...this ho frail!
Blac Youngsta: you coulda brawled with money at the hotel
.45 under the bed, I'm cheatin' on wifey wit' a cougar bitch
Off the first blast, I could merge cabs, have ya Uber Lyft
Do some shit!
My lil' nigga got the deuce-five on him
I said, ""Naw, I'ma cut him""
But he don't be listenin' to what I be tellin' this guy
So after I sliced him, he still shot him: that's a buck-seventy-five!
I'm in Pontiac, swaggin'
But I'm always in New York ready
I'll have Raw all over New York like New York Freddie
I been reppin'
If I see narcotics in ya men's section
You gon' see Ill in the cut like an infection!
I pack the .40
Don't act out in a act of glory
He got so many butts from the 12, they gave him statutory!
Cave Gang? Darkside!?
We couldn't be those geeks
I'd rather drink bleach for three whole weeks
You couldn't stop this chopper with Neo feet
I got somethin' new, all in
Ready to see Raw fish like a Creole feast!
He no beef, I could still cut him
I could cut him, but these swell victims
Took him out his shoes before the blade: I'm Ezal stealin'!
I toss my bitch the Dezzi
Yeah, my bitch'll roast you
Watch her stroke my ego like a bitch supposed to
I coast through, burn him with the Glock
Lottery pick: a .357 turn straight into a box!
Fuck nigga, actin' like he know he safe
The kickback throw Raw out the window like a police chase
Brizz, who is you steppin' to?
I will three-piece-suit you, schedule the service before the reverend knew
Only if Heaven knew, I could make life merge with Tekken 2
After I aah-aah-aah-ooh-aah-
BOY, THAT WAS LIKE, SEVEN MOVES!
Hi, Brizz! BOW! That's a .44 greetin'
Everybody buttoned up at the top and chess all open like a Cholo meetin'
You got kids? Well I'll hit ya son, split ya daughter, this a slaughter
Burn his chest, stab his leg, this is torture
Buck 50, buck 50, this is Sparta
I will slap whoever, I don't care if I'm in the 'Yac, where ever
If you gettin' money than Ill all over Raw chicken like salmonella
You act hard, but you still got some timid ways
Tim McVeigh, I blow up shit where ya kitten play
He decay if I lift the K, that's how a dentist play
He try to run and hit his head at the last minute like, ""Oh I know what I was finna say.""
This my day, I'm doin' everything my way
I'll give ya bitch a mud bath, it ain't a spa day
So how you want it? Ya jaw wired like Kanye?

Brizz versus Ill Will, it's gon' be a crazy
There's a lot of battles on this card, and this gon' be ya favorite one
And I ain't gon' play wit' him
Why I'm battlin' you? Well it ain't no explainin' it
From Ars' to Ill Will the fans see the bullshit and they ain't okay wit' it
Well, who OK'd the shit?
You got the iron cocked? Well you better strike when that iron hot
Cause I'ma leave a hole in Will (wheel) on the side of the road like that tire popped
All you gon see is pieces of Will (wheel) stacked in the garage like a tire shop
What's poppin' Willy?
Well it don't matter it's 12 o'clock, I'ma lift him up like we poppin' wheelies
That'll get in focus, fuck who hot, Brizz the coldest
I put dick in ya mother mouth, when I fly down with the zipper open
If there's somethin' in that shit you smokin'
I split you watch the guts fly out like when a Swisher open
Fuck whatcha mama think, you get ya mama shanked
Then get stuffed into a Mazda until ya mama stank
Wait, wait, wait, correct me if it's my mistake
But I kinda think he ain't climb the ranks
But ya makin' me (Jamaican) me wanna get uglier than Shabba Ranks
I brought four of these bitches to Set It Off, we ain't robbin' banks
Tonight, I'm ahead wit' weapons and I'ma leave ya head in sections
Live, In Living Color and sit ya face on the table like the Head Detective
BAOW! I blow the brains everywhere
I mean, I'm not sure if you heard but that's how I spread the message
Where ya kinfolk? Get ya chin broke
{Gun cocking} 10-4, send 'em in, I crack they egg then give ya men toast
This pair is (Paris) from France, he gettin' French toast
You can spit folk, but you a bitch tho'

I make ya mother suck dick three times then six mo'
I'ma keep talkin' shit 'bout ya mom and shit bro
Cause it's crazy how ya ugly ass mom fine as shit tho'
She get the dick fast, then get the dick slow
Then I'ma switch strokes, to a six stroke, then she dick choke
Wham! Then a rib broke
Y'all heard niggas bleed just like us?
Well today Somebody Gotta Die, that's a BIG quote
What you 6'4""?
Bitch, so?
You better dip low or get ya shit sewed like I stitch clothes
I bet whoever I see, see (CC) I ain't e-mailin' ya shit
I came for that smoke dawg like Ezal in this bitch
You from Pontiac, don't act like no female in this bitch
Cause for a grand damn (Grand AM) I clean Pontiac up like I'm detailin' a whip
Tell this crab, I'm the muscle (mussel) so if I see (sea) food I leave shells in the whip
You sad folk, ironic, you was shootin' up on SMACK then you fell off like bad dope
This vet' shit Ill, okay? I'mma drown you if you set trip, Ill
Don't be shocked when he's underwater, y'all better hope he's an electric eel (Ill)
Nigga these bullets got ya mama name on 'em like yo' electric bill
Nigga, yes this will
Remind you of ya last battle cause ya gettin' Clips for the low like a Netflix deal
What are you jerks provin'? Be still
'Cause after my first movement, he get the gun to his dome
(*chk-chk*) Then the bullets through the temple - that's a church shootin'
See, Swave? I'm a Rare Breed
I come through fast at rare speed
One punch, clip through the wind and make the air bleed
He don't scare me
Let's be fair, Beas'
He had niggas fooled longer than Steve Harvey hair piece
But the can' I'm sportin' waves next to the hair grease
Tonight, I'm gettin' drunk off the open bottle like it's no tomorrow
But I gotta leave a round in Will bigger than a Forgiato
The Glock fresh out the box with no bodies like bony models
I heard yo' ass had a lot to say
Well Busta Rhyme yo' ass will get shot today
They'll ask did he (Diddy) get for real (Pharrell) wit' a nigga from the 'Yac?
I said, Pass The Courvoisier
Dezzi bird kickin' like cranes in the sky, shit feelin' like Solange today
Get the chalk for him, cause it's back to the chalk board
I bet the whole card hear it when I talk to him
Cause I'ma plug a knife in his top like an ox core
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout
Bet the blade make the skull come out
When I bring it down like I'm talkin' loud
But, wait, wait, wait, I bring it back up like we got shit to talk about!
What's the deal Will? Let's get the deal sealed
I'll leave scars on his face like the real feel

[Round 2: Ill Will]
Can we have some fun just right quick?
Can your grandmother told me I had a great gene inside me hidin'
I couldn't keep it in
We both watch my kids fight fo' they life on the bed sheet dryin'
Rather than tryin' to beat the mind deep as a diggin' passages halfway to the core of pimpin'
When niggas was fuckin' nigga's mothers from the beginnin' of time and-
Let me be honest, if you text out every hoe that I've stretched out it'll be nothin' new
Just a double shot of smooth for ya boo and ya crew and I never have a bad drought
Y'all niggas came here on planes...cool, y'all gotta go the hotel route
They didn't even book my niggas rooms, I told 'em Brizz mama givin' head out

{Ill Will starts fake choking to further imitate Lux's first round versus Calicoe}
Hold on, let me get it together. Brizz mama givin' head out, Brizz mama givin' head out. Brizz mama givin' head out, what I say? Brizz mama givin' head out. What I say? Brizz mama givin' head out. Brizz mama was suckin' dick she was givin' head out. What I say? She grabbed on dicks and was suckin' 'em. She's a bitch that suck dick and she was givin' head out

Every nigga I fuck wit' thorough, just check the thread count
You talk shit, I walk shit
Spark shit, I would like to play a game: Saw 6!

Good shotty, he a nigga I prolly catch slippin' in the hood prolly
You seen Guardians Of The Galaxy? You Groot, a nigga I would (wood) body
Black ratchets, nappin' (nappy)these hoes, it's too late for that Don Imus
Arm stuck in the shootin' position, aaaaw maybe it's arthritis
If I catch you, you dead, lay in the box silent
And send that coffin (coughing) to God, pray for my bronchitis
I don't see people, I just see dead things
.40 lickin', this pussy got his red wings
What's the biz here? I came to his mama house like, ""Is Brizz here?""
Two Dezi's, double D's squeeze tight in Brizz ear
You know, double D's squeeze tight in brazier
That shit was okay? A little iffy?
Well how 'bout I put the double D's on ya head like Little Nicky?
Ya boy is back, my respect? Don't toy with that
I come in, burnin' Brandon in the chest like he tryin' to join a frat
I will have a threesome witcha mama and yo' auntie Gladys
Stuff a cone while yo' mama toss yo' auntie's salad
Yo' pops show up, then mine do too
I'm the one shootin'
I had dick down her throat and I gave ya auntie the balls like I'm done hoopin'
Fuck you! Bitch ass nigga, I got a crazy mouth
I come in, deucin' ya woman and take ya baby out
Aye, get ya story right, we can have a gory fight like 40 nights
He gon' be the one to catch the big shot, livin' Horry life
Or this bitch can give him all she got, it's a supporting wife
I'm more than nice, hard headed, mom's had to say shit more than twice
Show up with more straps than C3 crib on orgy night
I'm more than nice, and I can take it a bit farther like I'm the shit starter
And these will get raised on Raw like Vince daughter
But you? Gas; Nazi victim
I see the Future in ya bitch; Scottie Pippen
Knock him down, he get the boot before the sock, I'm Ducati shiftin'
Dope, New Edition on the Brown handle, I'm Bobby sniffin'
Y'all know how y'all whoopin' a nigga ass, slip and fall and he get the best of you?
That's how Roc beat me, now I'm goin' ape
Hangin' these cats over the ledge I'm Rafiki
He can get a butt in the ring; Rikishi
These twins, but I only used to run wit' one in NY, it's not Tiki
Ya bitch? Wanna link up, I send my dude out to meet her
All she do is suck and fuck, this dude out to please her
I'll send them killers to ya home, we 'bout to make you move out and leave her
Or a chunk of raw meat in the seat like, ""Mom said take that Raw meat out the freezer.""
I'm skitzo Brizz, but right now, I'm in an okay mood
Sometimes I dream of cuttin' dope with the same knife that OJ use
BAOW! Tool hit you, he lose twenty whole liters
Don't play okay, our K's ain't studio speakers
I run down on him, right at the address
Bullets kickin' through the windshield; Pineapple Express
I ain't impressed
And T-Top, you keep talkin' 'bout the motherfuckin' drugs and you ain't got that motherfuckin' toy witchu?
You trappin' in silence, Vatican violence, I'll beat the pope out you if you got a lil' boy witchu
Smack, you got this boy witchu?
What you tryin' to add some relevance to him?
Now you got Raw behind bars like the evidence room
I step in this room with plenty arms, I bring many harm
Left this rat over Raw like Nicky Barnes
The reason why I walk around, prolly cause I don't know y'all probably
All y'all niggas is carbon Xerox, photocopies
I don't care if I'm alone, solo or deep as long as the fo' fo' got me
If yo' bitch run in front of this chopper it's gon' shred her (Shredder) I named it Oroku Saki
Yak Town in this bitch!

[Round 2: Brizz Rawsteen]
You know, you don't gotta tell me 'bout the .45 strap
And how the .9 clap, cause that's lies; facts
Where you find these guys at?
I mean besides that
Yo' last battle, you told Clips you be finger fuckin' a nigga til he climax
Right then I paused like, ""Why scrap?""
My nigga, where is yo' mind at?
Bitch I had to rewind that like ""Damn, that was a good line but why would rhyme that?""
What's up wit' this nigga? My machete catch you finger fuckin' a nigga
Cut ya hand off, now ya finger's stuck in a nigga
Faggot!
You got the game jacked up, you lame fat fuck, you ain't that tough
You fell off SMACK for two years to get ya name back up
You got in fake shootouts on camera to get ya fame back up
This ain't no step down for me Smack
Oh no, even though he did PG's and BET the year before me and won
Well look at us now for me Smack, huh
No,  you gotta check out the run down for me Smack
I proved I could kill DNA, DNA proved you wasn't a killer
I had a classic with Roc, you got ya ass whipped with Roc
I showed off on Showoff, Showoff showed off on you
I killed Arsonal, vers' Arsonal you lost that too
Man this is a step down for me Smack
I thought you was down with me Smack
But see rap, that's what I'm better at doin'
That's ya man, I'll have him lookin' like ya never knew him
When the shells on his back like the turtles but the metal on his head got him lookin' like The Shredder to him
When my bros find you, bitch they gon' clothes line you
That's a hole and whatever you rock or wear (Rocawear)
Then Roc will put the chain 'round his neck like Hov signed you
Check The Blueprint, I never been afraid
To say what's on my mind cause the M-16 (Em 16) got a magazine
That'll fuck up ya day like Jay on Renegade
Now versus Clips you had long rap rounds nigga
I got clips long enough to wrap 'round niggas
Yak Town, ya drunk ass better put the 'gnac down
Cause I'ma get Get Rich Or Die Trying and this .50 don't Back Down
These serve all day, catch a MAC round
I have his body hangin' halfway out the bag like a hash brown
We gotta get some thangs in order or I maintain some for ya
This .40 kick this bitch 100 feet away with a clip full of restrainin' orders
This stage? Not for William
I brought shots for William
Fuckin' up yo' posture William
Think Jeffrey, cause with Fresh prints (Prince) on the tre (tray) I Will Smith him like Master William
Fuck Yak Town, I'm a dark nigga
That dark nigga, tonight the Yak (gnac) get served by the bartender
I got single shots, double shots, but the tips for y'all niggas
You be rippin' niggas off, I be rippin' shit off niggas
I'll have more cats in his hood than Jaguar car dealers
If I declare war the deuce is wild but I still cut shit like card dealers
No no no, I target ya, like a Nazi at a bar mitzvah
And I ain't leavin' no prints that's what I brought mitts fa
Then I'm carvin' a, Swastika and a round in his top not a Yamaka
Then y'all niggas spit the flame in ya window like it's Hanukkah
Mazel tov, tell him, ""Knock it off"" or I give him mama raw
Cock with the condom off
You made it look easy on SMACK, now you just tryin' hard
This guy's a fraud, at NOME 6 you were smokin' our weed and ain't had no money to buy cigars
Talkin' 'bout ""They eight dollars.""
(Eight dollars)
Eight dollars!
What's the topic dawg?
How I'm Cave Gang and Roc the boss?
Cool, well 'til Roc get off stage I let a rocket off
Break shit, spaceship, the way ya top lift off
Chill Will before you get the Tylenol
That's a chill pill to put his brains on the tile and all
You said ya pops was from 3rd Ward Calliope then all over the projects, right?
Well you know if I catch him in the 3rd Ward this cal' will open shit all over the projects, right?
Cool, well stop playin' with the Cave
You dissin' us now, but that's lame to the Cave
At NOME 6, you really tried to hang wit' the Cave
But history shows, masters don't be hangin' with the slaves
You fucked up kid
Nah, you know what's fucked up is?
You got smoked twice, Smack passed on you, you know the rules nigga, puff puff give
You like the west coast in '97, boy you done fucked up BIG
So we gotta have a big discussion and you gon' get whipped for nothin'
If I don't catch him on the left I catch Will (wheel) on the right like a whip in London
Darkside nigga

[Round 3: Ill Will]
Aye Smack, I had to come up with these pop offs
I couldn't figure out which one was the best
I'ma help you out, you tell me which one you suggest
The first one you said, ""Nigga you fuckin' soft
I'll fuck ya mother in the ass and make her suck it off
All sorta options, I'm talkin' hand behind the head while his daughter watchin'

[Brizz]
Leg up

[Ill Will]
Oh, oh, leg up, that shit was cold
I'm talkin' three below
I just don't like the fact you was talkin' 'bout fuckin' in front of a three year old

{Someone in the stage passes out}

I just don't like the fact you was talkin' 'bout fuckin' in front of a three year old
I got kids nigga
Nieces and nephews nigga
How it sound makin' ya mama suck my nephew dick? You don't like that do you?
But I'ma raw dog, Raw broad 'til she dog Raw
She Kobe with the mouth, she a ball hog
She got me jumpin' out my boxers in position like Balrog
Aw nah!
But I scratch that Smack, I said, ""I don't like that pop off.""
Then I said, ""Nigga, I ain't Chilla. You can't call me for no Jakkboy Maine.""
Nigga I'll bang the steel, Ryda, ain't no rider, he need training wheels
Mike P, that's a pussy option
I'll knock Twork on his head like he pussy poppin'
Shoot Chef like Johnny Depp, yeah nigga I got those
And this will point (disappoint) at Ave like city potholes
Hold on I got mo'
Cause nigga you said my name nigga and that ain't what we 'bout
I already shot up a Bigg K, we can clear the scene out
Motherfucka I'll put you on motherfuckin' 48 Hours, I'll bring the streets out
In other words Ave gon' be on A&E once I take the V out

Hey, yeah

Yesterday changed my mind
Now I see you as one of a kind
How I really need you
(How I really need you)
Hope you feel the same way too
(Hope you feel the same way)

[Chorus 1]
'Cause if you look you will find
It's me you need in your life
It's really not about me
It's really all about you

[Verse 2]
It's driving me crazy
Can't figure you out
How to keep you steady going this route
Tell me that you feel the same
(Tell me that you feel the same)
The thought has crossed you won't remain
(The thought has crossed you won't remain)

Just to think that I
Could bring joy in your life
It's really not about me
It's really all about you

322,Under The Water,"Bees are buzzin' in their honey catacomb
All the noise seems to call my head a home
Can't escape the scratchin'
My blood makes a noise
It's hard not to play when there are so many toys
So many toys

Under the water
The total is more than the sum
Under the water
I hear who I'll become

There's a hole inside my head where all the thoughts leak out
Sometimes my flesh is filled with forgetfulnes and doubt
It's easy to feel separate, no control of the reigns
Innocence ain't lost it just needs to be maintained
It needs to be maintained

Beside me are strange fish, moody and dark
A tapestry of intention that maintains the spark
And there's a tiny light
A flicker within
Forgiveness is the needle that knows how to mend
It knows how to mend

Under the water
The total is more than the sum
Under the water
I hear who I'll become

(Spoken ""Rap"")
I've decided to hear who we will become
Wanna lay down in the water, go back to where I'm from
Outer space is just a puzzle of stars
Music the mechanics of the human heart
A post that stirs, a shadow that casts
An insatiable thirst drains a martini glass
There's no place sacred, no honest reflection
Our senses made senseless by a lack o' direction
Monks are great with their fists uncurled
But they live in a cave, they know nothin' of the world
I wanna live brave, I wanna love without fear
But it's hard to navigate when I can't even hear

(Do do do do do do do
Do do do do)

Bees are buzzin' in their honey catacomb
All the noise seems to call my head a home
Can't escape the scratchin'
My blood makes a noise
It's hard not to play when there are so many toys
There're so many toys

Under the water
The total is more than the sum
Under the water
I hear who I'll become

Under the water
My flesh is filled with stars
Under the water
I hear who we really are

Under the water
I lay my burdens down, down, down
Under the water
All resistance drowns

Go under the water

Uh, the best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
No matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple double, no assists
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Arguing with my older bitch, acting like I owe her shit
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, ""This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now""
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it ""Malibooyah""
Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit 'em with a new style?
Know that motherfucker well: ""What you gon' do now?""
Whatever I wanna do, gosh! It's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So mommy, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ahh, put the pussy in a sarcophagus

Head of the class and she just won a swallowship

My presence is a present, kiss my ass

Question: What do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfucking monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles, I
Kill the block, I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles' heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and blood-suckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Milling about, spilling they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I get it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Pull up in the monster, automobile gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah I'm in that Tonka, color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king but watch the queen conquer
Okay, first things first, I'll eat your brains
Then I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a motherfucking monster do
Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, ""Dutty Wine"" it, wylin'
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really, really I don't give a F-U-C-K
""Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki 'cause she's fake""
""She on a diet,"" but my pockets eating cheesecake
And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's Child's Play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, 'Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Am should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Aaaah, I'm a motherfucking monster!

I, I crossed the limelight

Never do what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do what they do, what they do, what they do

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Lost generation, fast paced nation
World population confront their frustration
The principles of true hip-hop have been forsaken
It's all contractual and about money makin
Pretend-to-be cats don't seem to know they limitation
Exact replication and false representation
You wanna be a man, then stand your own
To MC requires skills, I demand some shown
I let the frauds keep frontin and roam like a cellular phone
Far from home giving crowds what they wantin
Official hip-hop consumption, the 5th thumpin
Keeping your party jumping with an original somethin
Yo, I dedicate this to the one-dimensional
No imagination, excuse for perpetration
My man came over and said: ""Yo we thought we heard you""
Joke's on you; you heard a biting-ass crew but um

Thin is the line that run between love and hatred
The game is ill-natured, it's nothing sacred
Aiyyo, it's funny when I see some rap niggas do to make it
A few'll blow up, or go as far as they can take it
My nine to five, is just to hit ya get the party live
I'm Black Thought, used to rap for sport
Now the rhyme saying rent paying life support
I take it very seriously, within this industry
It's various crews that try to touch me
But I come with the beautiful things, and I bless the track plushly
Around the world crowds love me, from doing tours
Recipient of applause from all of you and yours
Creator of original sounds that's in the stores
You take home to absorb and sweat it out your pores
Now who can stop the music running through these veins?
Infinitely go against the grain, that's why my motto's to

Living the life of limos and lights
Airplanes and trains, short days and long nights
Keyboards and mics, bass chords and drum kicks
And my mental thick they hit my head like brick
As I embark on a mission welcoming to the dark
When I first spark the arts, when the listening start
Open your head wide, and let the Thought inside
My style fortified by all of Philadelphi
My delph more stealth than all the wicked wealthy
Mentality undetectable by the naked eye
Then I get paid when the record is played
To put it short ""I want it made"" like Ed, nuff said
Then after that, I'm putting on my cousin Hamed
We let the ladies blend with the dark-skinned thoroughbred
And discover, my level is that of no other

Steeple guide me to my heart and home

330,I'm Not Giving You Up,"To be completely honest
It scares me to imagine
What life would be without you

And for this very reason
I ask you to forgive me
For what I'm putting us through

Although there are so many things
Against us, I've decided
That I'm not giving you up, no...

Thinking back, I see what we have
Is something different
I think we've known all along
So how fair would it be
To divide this love's existence
Between what's right and what's wrong

And you, always wondering if we'll make it
Time will tell you
That I'm not giving you up, no, no...

We'll find a way to be together
However long it takes, wherever
If it means having you for only a moment
A moment just might be enough
I'm not giving you up, no
No I'm not giving you up, no

Screaming in the silence the promises we've spoken
Come back to haunt me, false and broken
Quiet desperation to see we're lost forever
Searching for water in the desert

No, I refuse to have to do
Without your kisses
I'm not giving you up, no, no

We'll find a way to be together
However long it takes, wherever
If it means having you for only a moment
A moment just might be enough

334,"I Finally Found Someone (From ""The Mirror Has Two Faces"")","WHAT is a judge-penitent? Ah, I intrigued you with that business. I meant no harm by it,
believe me, and I can explain myself more clearly. In a way, that even belongs to my official duties.
But first I must set forth a certain number of facts that will help you to understand my story.
A few years ago I was a lawyer in Paris and, indeed, a rather well-known lawyer. Of course, I
didn’t tell you my real name. I had a specialty: noble cases. Widows and orphans, as the saying
goes—I don’t know why, because there are improper widows and ferocious orphans. Yet it was
enough for me to sniff the slightest scent of victim on a defendant for me to swing into action. And
what action! A real tornado! My heart was on my sleeve. You would really have thought that justice
slept with me every night. I am sure you would have admired the rightness of my tone, the
appropriateness of my emotion, the persuasion and warmth, the restrained indignation of my
speeches before the court. Nature favored me as to my physique, [18] and the noble attitude comes
effortlessly. Furthermore, I was buoyed up by two sincere feelings: the satisfaction of being on the
right side of the bar and an instinctive scorn for judges in general. That scorn, after all, wasn’t
perhaps so instinctive. I know now that it had its reasons. But, seen from the outside, it looked
rather like a passion. It can’t be denied that, for the moment at least, we have to have judges, don’t
we? However, I could not understand how a man could offer himself to perform such a surprising
function. I accepted the fact because I saw it, but rather as I accepted locusts. With this difference:
that the invasions of those Orthoptera never brought me a son whereas I earned my living by
carrying on a dialogue with people I scorned.
But, after all, I was on the right side; that was enough to satisfy my conscience. The feeling of the
law, the satisfaction of being right, the joy of self-esteem, cher monsieur, are powerful incentives for
keeping us upright or keeping us moving forward. On the other hand, if you deprive men of them,
you transform them into dogs frothing with rage. How many crimes committed merely because [19]
their authors could not endure being wrong! I once knew a manufacturer who had a perfect wife,
admired by all, and yet he deceived her. That man was literally furious to be in the wrong, to be
blocked from receiving, or granting himself, a certificate of virtue. The more virtues his wife
manifested, the more vexed he became. Eventually, living in the wrong became unbearable to him.
What do you think he did then? He gave up deceiving her? Not at all. He killed her. That is how I
entered into relations with him.
My situation was more enviable. Not only did I run no risk of joining the criminal camp (in
particular I had no chance of killing my wife, being a bachelor), but I even took up their defense, on
the sole condition that they should be noble murderers, as others are noble savages. The very
manner in which I conducted that defense gave me great satisfactions. I was truly above reproach in
my professional life. I never accepted a bribe, it goes without saying, and I never stooped either to
any shady proceedings. And—this is even rarer—I never deigned to flatter any journalist to get him
on my side, nor any civil servant whose friendship [20] might be useful to me. I even had the luck of
seeing the Legion of Honor offered to me two or three times and of being able to refuse it with a
discreet dignity in which I found my true reward. Finally, I never charged the poor a fee and never
boasted of it. Don’t think for a moment, cher monsieur, that I am bragging. I take no credit for this.
The avidity which in our society substitutes for ambition has always made me laugh. I was aiming
higher; you will see that the expression is exact in my case.
But you can already imagine my satisfaction. I enjoyed my own nature to the fullest, and we all
know that there lies happiness, although, to soothe one another mutually, we occasionally pretend to
condemn such joys as selfishness. At least I enjoyed that part of my nature which reacted so
appropriately to the widow and orphan that eventually, through exercise, it came to dominate my
whole life. For instance, I loved to help blind people cross streets. From as far away as I could see a cane hesitating on the edge of a sidewalk, I would rush forward, sometimes only a second ahead of
another charitable hand already outstretched, snatch the blind person from any solicitude but mine,
and lead [21] him gently but firmly along the crosswalk among the traffic obstacles toward the refuge
of the other sidewalk, where we would separate with a mutual emotion. In the same way, I always
enjoyed giving directions in the street, obliging with a light, lending a hand to heavy pushcarts,
pushing a stranded car, buying a paper from the Salvation Army lass or flowers from the old
peddler, though I knew she stole them from the Montparnasse cemetery. I also liked—and this is
harder to say—I liked to give alms. A very Christian friend of mine admitted that one’s initial feeling
on seeing a beggar approach one’s house is unpleasant. Well, with me it was worse: I used to exult.
But let’s not dwell on this.
Let us speak rather of my courtesy. It was famous and unquestionable. Indeed, good manners
provided me with great delights. If I had the luck, certain mornings, to give up my seat in the bus or
subway to someone who obviously deserved it, to pick up some object an old lady had dropped and
return it to her with a smile I knew well, or merely to forfeit my taxi to someone in a greater hurry
than I, it was a red-letter day. I even rejoiced, I must admit, those days when the transport system
[22] being on strike I had a chance to load into my car at the bus stops some of my unfortunate
fellow citizens unable to get home. Giving up my seat in the theater to allow a couple to sit together,
hoisting a girl’s suitcases onto the rack in a train—these were all deeds I performed more often than
others because I paid more attention to the opportunities and was better able to relish the pleasure
they give.
Consequently I was considered generous, and so I was. I gave a great deal in public and in
private. But far from suffering when I had to give up an object or a sum of money, I derived
constant pleasures from this—among them a sort of melancholy which occasionally rose within me
at the thought of the sterility of those gifts and the probable ingratitude that would follow. I even
took such pleasure in giving that I hated to be obliged to do so. Exactitude in money matters bored
me to death and I conformed ungraciously. I had to be the master of my liberalities.
These are just little touches but they will help you grasp the constant delights I experienced in my
life, and especially in my profession. Being stopped in the corridor of the law courts by the wife of a
[23] defendant you represented out of justice or pity alone—I mean without charge—hearing that
woman whisper that nothing, no, nothing could ever repay what you had done for them, replying
that it was quite natural, that anyone would have done as much, even offering some financial help to
tide over the bad days ahead, then—in order to cut the effusions short and preserve their proper
resonance—kissing the hand of a poor woman and breaking away—believe me, cher monsieur, this is
achieving more than the vulgar ambitious man and rising to that supreme summit where virtue is its
own reward
Let’s pause on these heights. Now you understand what I meant when I spoke of aiming higher. I
was talking, it so happens, of those supreme summits, the only places I can really live. Yes, I have
never felt comfortable except in lofty places. Even in the details of daily life, I needed to feel above. I
preferred the bus to the subway, open carriages to taxis, terraces to closed-in places. An enthusiast
for sport planes in which one’s head is in the open, on boats I was the eternal pacer of the top deck.
In the mountains I used to flee the deep valleys for [24] the passes and plateaus; I was the man of
the mesas at least. If fate had forced me to choose between work at a lathe or as a roofer, don’t
worry, I’d have chosen the roofs and become acquainted with dizziness. Coalbins, ships’ holds,
undergrounds, grottoes, pits were repulsive to me. I had even developed a special loathing for
speleologists, who had the nerve to fill the front page of our newspapers, and whose records
nauseated me. Striving to reach elevation minus eight hundred at the risk of getting one’s head
caught in a rocky funnel (a siphon, as those fools say!) seemed to me the exploit of perverted or
traumatized characters. There was something criminal underlying it.
A natural balcony fifteen hundred feet above a sea still visible bathed in sunlight, on the other
hand, was the place where I could breathe most freely, especially if I were alone, well above the
human ants. I could readily understand why sermons, decisive preachings, and fire miracles took
place on accessible heights. In my opinion no one meditated in cellars or prison cells (unless they
were situated in a tower with a broad view); one just became moldy. And I could understand that
man who, [25] having entered holy orders, gave up the frock because his cell, instead of overlooking
a vast landscape as he expected, looked out on a wall. Rest assured that as far as I was concerned I
did not grow moldy. At every hour of the day, within myself and among others, I would scale the
heights and light conspicuous fires, and a joyful greeting would rise toward me. Thus at least I took
pleasure in life and in my own excellence.
My profession satisfied most happily that vocation for summits. It cleansed me of all bitterness
toward my neighbor, whom I always obligated without ever owing him anything. It set me above the
judge whom I judged in turn, above the defendant whom I forced to gratitude. Just weigh this, cher
monsieur, I lived with impunity. I was concerned in no judgment; I was not on the floor of the
courtroom, but somewhere in the flies like those gods that are brought down by machinery from
time to time to transfigure the action and give it its meaning. After all, living aloft is still the only way
of being seen and hailed by the largest number.
Besides, some of my good criminals had killed [26] in obedience to the same feeling. Reading the
newspapers afterward, in the sorry condition in which they then were, doubtless brought them a sort
of unhappy compensation. Like many men, they had no longer been able to endure anonymity, and
that impatience had contributed to leading them to unfortunate extremities. To achieve notoriety it
is enough, after all, to kill one’s concierge. Unhappily, this is usually an ephemeral reputation, so
many concierges are there who deserve and receive the knife. Crime constantly monopolizes the
headlines, but the criminal appears there only fugitively, to be replaced at once. In short, such brief
triumphs cost too dear. Defending our unfortunate aspirants after a reputation amounted, on the
other hand, to becoming really well known, at the same time and in the same places, but by more
economical means. Consequently this encouraged me to making more meritorious efforts so that
they would pay as little as possible. What they were paying they were doing so to some extent in my
place. The indignation, talent, and emotion I expended on them washed away, in return, any debt I
might feel toward them. The judges punished and the defendants expiated, [27] while I, free of any
duty, shielded from judgment as from penalty, I freely held sway bathed in a light as of Eden.
Indeed, wasn’t that Eden, cher monsieur: no intermediary between life and me? Such was my life. I
never had to learn how to live. In that regard, I already knew everything at birth. Some people’s
problem is to protect themselves from men or at least to come to terms with them. In my case, the
understanding was already established. Familiar when it was appropriate, silent when necessary,
capable of a free and easy manner as readily as of dignity, I was always in harmony. Hence my
popularity was great and my successes in society innumerable. I was acceptable in appearance; I
revealed myself to be both a tireless dancer and an unobtrusively learned man; I managed to love
simultaneously—and this is not easy—women and justice; I indulged in sports and the fine arts—in
short, I’ll not go on for fear you might suspect me of self-flattery. But just imagine, I beg you, a man
at the height of his powers, in perfect health, generously gifted, skilled in bodily exercises as in those
of the mind, neither rich nor poor, sleeping well, [28] and fundamentally pleased with himself
without showing this otherwise than by a felicitous sociability. You will readily see how I can speak,
without immodesty, of a successful life.
Yes, few creatures were more natural than I. I was altogether in harmony with life, fitting into it
from top to bottom without rejecting any of its ironies, its grandeur, or its servitude. In particular
the flesh, matter, the physical in short, which disconcerts or discourages so many men in love or in
solitude, without enslaving me, brought me steady joys. I was made to have a body. Whence that harmony in me, that relaxed mastery that people felt, even to telling me sometimes that it helped
them in life. Hence my company was in demand. Often, for instance, people thought they had met
me before. Life, its creatures and its gifts, offered themselves to me, and I accepted such marks of
homage with a kindly pride. To tell the truth, just from being so fully and simply a man, I looked
upon myself as something of a superman.
I was of respectable but humble birth (my father was an officer), and yet, certain mornings, let
me confess it humbly, I felt like a king’s son, or a [29] burning bush. It was not a matter, mind you,
of the certainty I had of being more intelligent than everyone else. Besides, such certainty is of no
consequence because so many imbeciles share it. No, as a result of being showered with blessings, I
felt, I hesitate to admit, marked out. Personally marked out, among all, for that long and
uninterrupted success. This, after all, was a result of my modesty. I refused to attribute that success
to my own merits and could not believe that the conjunction in a single person of such different and
such extreme virtues was the result of chance alone. This is why in my happy life I felt somehow
that that happiness was authorized by some higher decree. When I add that I had no religion you
can see even better how extraordinary that conviction was. Whether ordinary or not, it served for
some time to raise me above the daily routine and I literally soared for a period of years, for which,
to tell the truth, I still long in my heart of hearts. I soared until the evening when ... But no, that’s
another matter and it must be forgotten. Anyway, I am perhaps exaggerating. I was at ease in
everything, to be sure, but at the same time satisfied with nothing. [30] Each joy made me desire
another. I went from festivity to festivity. On occasion I danced for nights on end, ever madder
about people and life. At times, late on those nights when the dancing, the slight intoxication, my
wild enthusiasm, everyone’s violent unrestraint would fill me with a tired and overwhelmed rapture,
it would seem to me—at the breaking point of fatigue and for a second’s flash—that at last I
understood the secret of creatures and of the world. But my fatigue would disappear the next day,
and with it the secret; I would rush forth anew. I ran on like that, always heaped with favors, never
satiated, without knowing where to stop, until the day—until the evening rather when the music
stopped and the lights went out. The gay party at which I had been so happy ... But allow me to call
on our friend the primate. Nod your head to thank him and, above all, drink up with me, I need
your understanding.
I see that that declaration amazes you. Have you never suddenly needed understanding, help,
friendship? Yes, of course. I have learned to be satisfied with understanding. It is found more readily
and, besides, it’s not binding. “I beg you to believe [31] in my sympathetic understanding” in the
inner discourse always precedes immediately “and now, let’s turn to other matters.” It’s a board
chairman’s emotion; it comes cheap, after catastrophes. Friendship is less simple. It is long and hard
to obtain, but when one has it there’s no getting rid of it; one simply has to cope with it. Don’t think
for a minute that your friends will telephone you every evening, as they ought to, in order to find out
if this doesn’t happen to be the evening when you are deciding to commit suicide, or simply whether
you don’t need company, whether you are not in a mood to go out. No, don’t worry, they’ll ring up
the evening you are not alone, when life is beautiful. As for suicide, they would be more likely to
push you to it, by virtue of what you owe to yourself, according to them. May heaven protect us, cher
monsieur, from being set on a pedestal by our friends! Those whose duty is to love us—I mean
relatives and connections (what an expression!)—are another matter. They find the right word, all
right, and it hits the bull’s-eye; they telephone as if shooting a rifle. And they know how to aim. Oh,
the Bazaines!
[32] What? What evening? I’ll get to it, be patient with me. In a certain way I am sticking to my
subject with all that about friends and connections. You see, I’ve heard of a man whose friend had
been imprisoned and who slept on the floor of his room every night in order not to enjoy a comfort
of which his friend had been deprived. Who, cher monsieur, will sleep on the floor for us? Whether I am capable of it myself? Look, I’d like to be and I shall be. Yes, we shall all be capable of it one day,
and that will be salvation. But it’s not easy, for friendship is absent-minded or at least unavailing. It
is incapable of achieving what it wants. Maybe, after all, it doesn’t want it enough? Maybe we don’t
love life enough? Have you noticed that death alone awakens our feelings? How we love the friends
who have just left us? How we admire those of our teachers who have ceased to speak, their mouths
filled with earth! Then the expression of admiration springs forth naturally, that admiration they
were perhaps expecting from us all their lives. But do you know why we are always more just and
more generous toward the dead? The reason is simple. With them there is no obligation. [33] They
leave us free and we can take our time, fit the testimonial in between a cocktail party and a nice little
mistress, in our spare time, in short. If they forced us to anything, it would be to remembering, and
we have a short memory. No, it is the recently dead we love among our friends, the painful dead,
our emotion, ourselves after all!
For instance, I had a friend I generally avoided. He rather bored me, and, besides, he was
something of a moralist. But when he was on his death bed, I was there—don’t worry. I never
missed a day. He died satisfied with me, holding both my hands. A woman who used to chase after
me, and in vain, had the good sense to die young. What room in my heart at once! And when, in
addition, it’s a suicide! Lord, what a delightful commotion! One’s telephone rings, one’s heart
overflows, and the intentionally short sentences yet heavy with implications, one’s restrained
suffering and even, yes, a bit of self-accusation!
That’s the way man is, cher monsieur. He has two faces: he can’t love without self-love. Notice your
neighbors if perchance a death takes place in the building. They were asleep in their little [34] routine
and suddenly, for example, the concierge dies. At once they awake, bestir themselves, get the details,
commiserate. A newly dead man and the show begins at last. They need tragedy, don’t you know; it’s
their little transcendence, their apéritif. Moreover, is it mere chance that I should speak of a
concierge? I had one, really ill favored, malice incarnate, a monster of insignificance and rancor, who
would have discouraged a Franciscan. I had even given up speaking to him, but by his mere
existence he compromised my customary contentedness. He died and I went to his funeral. Can you
tell me why?
Anyway, the two days preceding the ceremony were full of interest. The concierge’s wife was ill,
lying in the single room, and near her the coffin had been set on sawhorses. Everyone had to get his
mail himself. You opened the door, said “Bonjour, madame,” listened to her praise of the dear
departed as she pointed to him, and took your mail. Nothing very amusing about that. And yet the
whole building passed through her room, which stank of carbolic acid. And the tenants didn’t send
their servants either; they came themselves to take [35] advantage of the unexpected attraction. The
servants did too, of course, but on the sly. The day of the funeral, the coffin was too big for the
door. “Oh my dearie,” the wife said from her bed with a surprise at once delighted and grieved,
“how big he was!” “Don’t worry, madame,” replied the funeral director, “we’ll get him through
edgewise, and upright.” He was got through upright and then laid down again, and I was the only
one (with a former cabaret doorman who, I gathered, used to drink his Pernod every evening with
the doparted) to go as far as the cemetery and strew flowers on a coffin of astounding luxury. Then I
paid a visit to the concierge’s wife to receive her thanks expressed as by a great tragedienne. Tell me,
what was the reason for all that? None, except the apértif.
I likewise buried an old fellow member of the Lawyers’ Guild. A clerk to whom no one paid
attention, but I always shook his hand. Where I worked I used to shake everyone’s hand, moreover,
being doubly sure to miss no one. Without much effort, such cordial simplicity won me the
popularity so necessary to my contentment. For the [36] funeral of our clerk the President of the
Guild had not gone out of his way. But I did, and on the eve of a trip, as was amply pointed out. It so happened that I knew my presence would be noticed and favorably commented on. Hence, you
see, not even the snow that was falling that day made me withdraw.
What? I’m getting to it, never fear; besides, I have never left it. But let me first point out that my
concierge’s wife, who had gone to such an out lay for the crucifix, heavy oak, and silver handles in
order to get the most out of her emotion, had shacked up a month later with an overdressed yokel
proud of his singing voice. He used to beat her; frightful screams could be heard and immediately
afterward he would open the window and give forth with his favorite song: “Women, how pretty
you are!” “All the same!” the neighbors would say. All the same what? I ask you. All right,
appearances were against the baritone, and against the concierge’s wife, too. But nothing proves that
they were not in love. And nothing proves either that she did not love her husband. Moreover, when
the yokel took flight, his voice and arm exhausted, she [37]—that faithful wife—resumed her praises
of the departed. After all, I know of others who have appearances on their side and are no more
faithful or sincere. I knew a man who gave twenty years of his life to a scatterbrained woman,
sacrificing everything to her, his friendships, his work, the very respectability of his life, and who one
evening recognized that he had never loved her. He had been bored, that’s all, bored like most
people. Hence he had made himself out of whole cloth a life full of complications and drama.
Something must happen—and that explains most human commitments. Something must happen,
even loveless slavery, even war or death. Hurray then for funerals!
But I at least didn’t have that excuse. I was not bored because I was riding on the crest of the
wave. On the evening I am speaking about I can say that I was even less bored than ever. And yet ...
You see, cher monsieur, it was a fine autumn evening, still warm in town and already damp over the
Seine. Night was falling; the sky, still bright in the west, was darkening; the street lamps were
glowing dimly. I was walking up the quays of the Left Bank toward the Pont des Arts. The river was
gleaming [38] between the stalls of the secondhand booksellers. There were but few people on the
quays; Paris was already at dinner. I was treading on the dusty yellow leaves that still recalled
summer. Gradually the sky was filling with stars that could be seen for a moment after leaving one
street lamp and heading toward another. I enjoyed the return of silence, the evening’s mildness, the
emptiness of Paris. I was happy. The day had been good: a blind man, the reduced sentence I had
hoped for, a cordial handclasp from my client, a few liberalities, and in the afternoon, a brilliant
improvisation in the company of several friends on the hardheartedness of our governing class and
the hypocrisy of our leaders.
I had gone up on the Pont des Arts, deserted at that hour, to look at the river that could hardly
be made out now night had come. Facing the statue of the Vert-Galant, I dominated the island. I felt
rising within me a vast feeling of power and—I don’t know how to express it—of completion,
which cheered my heart. I straightened up and was about to light a cigarette, the cigarette of
satisfaction, when, at that very moment, a laugh burst out [39] behind me. Taken by surprise, I
suddenly wheeled around; there was no one there. I stepped to the railing; no barge or boat. I turned
back toward the island and, again, heard the laughter behind me, a little farther off as if it were going
downstream. I stood there motionless. The sound of the laughter was decreasing, but I could still
hear it distinctly behind me, come from nowhere unless from the water. At the same time I was
aware of the rapid beating of my heart. Please don’t misunderstand me; there was nothing
mysterious about that laugh; it was a good, hearty, almost friendly laugh, which re-established the
proper proportions. Soon I heard nothing more, anyway. I returned to the quays, went up the rue
Dauphine, bought some cigarettes I didn’t need at all. I was dazed and had trouble breathing. That
evening I rang up a friend, who wasn’t at home. I was hesitating about going out when, suddenly, I
heard laughter under my windows. I opened them. On the sidewalk, in fact, some youths were
loudly saying good night. I shrugged my shoulders as I closed the windows; after all, I had a brief to study. I went into the bathroom to drink a glass of water. My reflection was smiling in the
mirror, but it seemed to me that my smile was double ...
What? Forgive me, I was thinking of something else. I’ll see you again tomorrow, probably.
Tomorrow, yes, that’s right. No, no, I can’t stay. Besides, I am called in consultation by that brown
bear of a man you see over there. A decent fellow, for sure, whom the police are meanly persecuting
out of sheer perversity. You think he looks like a killer? Rest assured that his actions conform to his
looks. He burgles likewise, and you will be surprised to learn that that cave man is specialized in the
art trade. In Holland everyone is a specialist in paintings and in tulips. This one, with his modest
mien, is the author of the most famous theft of a painting. Which one? I may tell you. Don’t be
surprised at my knowledge. Although I am a judge-penitent, I have my side line here: I am the legal
counselor of these good people. I studied the laws of the country and built up a clientele in this
quarter where diplomas are not required. It wasn’t easy, but I inspire confidence, don’t I? I have a
good, hearty laugh and an energetic handshake, and those are trump cards. Besides, I settled a
few difficult cases, out of self-interest to begin with and later out of conviction. If pimps and thieves
were invariably sentenced, all decent people would get to thinking they themselves were constantly
innocent, cher monsieur. And in my opinion—all right, all right, I’m coming!—that’s what must be
avoided above all. Otherwise, everything would be just a joke.",Albert Camus,1997,"[70, 72, 64, 58, 52, 36, 38, 28, 23, 22, 20, 14, 16, 9]",14
335,We Danced Anyway,"[Verse 1]
The summer air was heavy and sweet
You and I on a crowded street
There was music everywhere

Far, far away

Well they say you can't go back
But baby I don't believe that
Come along with me
Come on and dance with me

We'll come back around

Feels like I'm standing in a timeless dream
Of light mists with pale amber rose
Feels like I'm lost in a deep cloud of heavenly scent
Touching, discovering you

Miles of windless summer night air (summer night air)

337,Where Do You Go,"[Verse 1]
Where did you go today?
Must have been lost, the wayfarer strays, I
I don't know the words to say
So, ""Nothing,"" I say, it's better that way, but

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby please, I know, I know
So take me please, I'll go, I'll go

You got me here, but you can't stay
There's nothing missing but you when you run away again
And I'm asking but you just can't say
I thought that you had my back

[Verse 2]
You have been everywhere
Chasing away the day
Facing away, you made it okay to please go and never stay
But where did you go today?
Could've been anywhere
But I believe there's something here that you should take in

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby please, I know, I know
So take me please, I'll go, I'll go

You brought me here, but you can't stay
There's nothing missing but you when you run away, girl

Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead

Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun

You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place, and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how 'bout yours?
That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored

How do we keep all our passions alive

Found Geronimo's rifle, Marilyn's shampoo
And Benny Goodman's corset and pen

You get down, real low down
You listen to Coltrane, derail your own train
Well who hasn't been there before?
I come round, around the hard way
Bring you comics in bed, scrape the mold off the bread
And serve you french toast again

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, okay, I still get stoned
I'm not the kind of girl you'd take home

If it makes you happy

And they brought me to my knees

Bend, corners like I was a curve, I struck a nerve
And now you 'bout to see this Southern playa serve
I heard it's not where you're from but where you pay rent
Then I heard it's not what you make but how much you spent
You got me bent like elbows, amongst other things, but I'm not worried
Cause when we step up in the party; like a mouse, you scurry
So go get your fucking shine box and your sack of nickels
It tickles to see you try to be like Mr. Pickles

And I try, to warn you not to test but you don't listen

Or will it know to beat the odds regardless of the skin tone?
Or will it feel that if we tune it, it just might get picked on?
Or will it give a fuck about what others say and get gone?

Life's a '45 when you can't buy it

Without love

Life is like my mother on a diet!

[ALL]
Like a week that's only Mondays
Only ice cream, never sundaes
Like a circle with no center
Like a door marked ""do not enter!""

Darlin' I'll be yours forever
'Cause I never wanna be
Without love

Yes, now you've captured me

Between you and me
We've only had a couple drinks
But I'm starting to think
I can close this tab
Oh, between you and me
I just wanna get out of here
And we could up and disappear
Into the back of a cab

Now, we ain't got to tell nobody
Between you and me
Is a black dress, T-shirt, and a pair of jeans
Couple steps, front door, baby, turn the key
And 'cause right now the only thing, only thing
Oh, between you and me

Hit the lights
Pull the blinds
Rip off the sheets

354,Knocks Me Off My Feet,"[Verse 1]
I see us in the park
Strolling the summer days of imaginings in my head
And words from my heart told only to the wind
Felt even without being said

[Chorus]
I don't wanna bore you with my troubles, yeah
But there's something about your love
That makes me weak and knocks me off my feet
There's something about your love
That makes me weak and knocks me off my feet
Knocks me off my feet
And I don't wanna bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't wanna bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you, more and more

We lay beneath the stars under a lover's tree
That seems through the eyes of my mind
I reach out for the part of me that lives in you
That only our two hearts can find

Never leave me alone, never leave me alone
Leave me alone never leave me alone
Never leave me alone
Never leave me alone, leave me alone
Never leave me alone, never leave me alone

[Verse 1: Nate Dogg]
They tell me that temptation
Ooh, is very hard to resist
You tell me that you want me
I tried to hide my feelings, D-O-G's ain't supposed to feel like this
You can call it what you want to
But I don't even know what it is
You've got me singin' in the morning
You bring me breakfast in my bed and when it hurts you rub my head
I'll ask you one time only, baby
Won't you be there when it's hectic, when I don't have a hit record

Never leave me alone, never leave me alone
Leave me alone never leave me alone
Never leave me alone
Never leave me alone, leave me alone
Never leave me alone, never leave me alone

[Verse 2: Nate Dogg]
I've traveled so many places, I've seen so many faces
And there were times I didn't think I'd make it through alone
I went through so many phases, that got me so many cases
Three strikes you're gone, then what you gonna do
I guess I'll call my lady, and tell her to kiss my baby
They tell me that crime is all I know how to do
Never leave me alone
Tell him his daddy's sorry, alone
Let him know all about me
There's one more thing I'd really like you to do

Never leave me alone, never leave me alone
Leave me alone never leave me alone
Never leave me alone
Never leave me alone, leave me alone
Never leave me alone, never leave me alone

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Man, somebody was naughty when they snitched on me
And the judge just sentenced me to do about a century
I'm mobbin' through the county mainline
Back in 9500 just tryin' to handle mine
Spittin' game at the homies about the good ol' days
As we try to pass time waiting for the chain to Chino
I see no reason to cry but I miss my baby boo
And my nigga Spanky too
It's true that the dirt I did from an O.G. to a snotty nose kid
Got me caught up in the rapture like maze, days gone by
And real G's gon' cry
But I try to walk the yard with my head to the sky
And hope my baby boo ain't fuckin' niggas on the outside
But what's the chance that it ain't crackin'
If I was out and she was in I'd probably be mackin'
I can't lie so I say I would, now my girl in a world of playa hood
A playa should show a nigga love and look out
But the niggas I know would probably turn your ass out
So keep away, better yet stay away
And hope I get out one day, okay
But if I don't, I guess this is home
My girl is trippin' she got a block on her phone

[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Val Young]
Never leave me alone
Will I be left alone, all alone, on my own
Leave me alone, never leave me alone
Will I be left alone, all alone, on my own
Leave me alone, never leave me alone

[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Val Young
Will I be left alone, all alone, on my own
Never leave me alone, never leave me alone
Will I be left alone, all alone, on my own
Never leave me alone, never leave me alone

[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Val Young]
Will I be left alone, all alone, on my own
Never leave me alone, leave me alone
Never leave me alone, never leave me alone
Will I be left alone, all alone, on my own
Never leave me alone, leave me alone
Never leave me alone, never leave me alone
Will I be left alone, all alone, on my own
Never leave me alone, Leave me alone
Never leave me alone, never leave me alone
Will I be left alone, all alone, on my own
Never leave me alone, leave me alone
Never leave me alone, never leave me alone
Will I be left alone, all alone, on my own
Never leave me alone, leave me alone
Never leave me alone, never leave me alone
Will I be left alone, all alone, on my own

Love ain't no fairytale, love is a buried nail
Inside of this heart of stone, so you wanna get married? Well

Juliet's at the nudie bar, doin' God only knows
Neither one of 'em came to see the dog and the pony show
But a bitch is a bitch, and a horse is a horse, ain't it?
Sorry, I can't afford to get your daddy's old Porsche painted
Sorry, Juliet that you embedded the sayin'
If a dollar makes you holler, well then I'm gettin' the short change of it
Uh, feel like I've been asleep and alone
And lovin' this angel, entangled between a dream and a coma
Walkin' the edge of this cliff, like a sheep to it's owner
Then woke up to this fuckin' bitch with an evil persona
Now if you say that you hate somebody and you livin' with them
Then they pack up and leave then you bitch about how you miss 'em
You gotta see the pattern of the blood all over the steerin' wheel
Love is a cannibal ridin' a carnival carousel
'Round and 'round we roll
Where it stops, baby nobody knows
Some people go crazy and they lose control
Some people jump off, some people won't let go
Some people say love, some people say why

358,It's All Coming Back To Me Now,"[Verse 1]
There were nights when the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed
If I just listened to it
Right outside the window
There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were
Drying up forever
I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made

[Chorus]
But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me
When I touch you like this
And I hold you like that
It's so hard to believe but
It's all coming back to me
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)

There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things I'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than any laws allow
Baby, baby

[Chorus]
If I kiss you like this
And if you whisper like that
It was lost long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you want me like this
And if you need me like that
It was dead long ago
But it's all coming back to me
It's so hard to resist
And it's all coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now
But it's all coming back

[Verse 3]
There were those empty threats and hollow lies
And whenever you tried to hurt me
I just hurt you even worse
And so much deeper
There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
That were lost to us forever
But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then

[Chorus]
But if I touch you like this
And if you kiss me like that
It was so long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you touch me like this
And if I kiss you like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)

There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things we'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than all your laws allow
Baby, baby, baby

[Chorus]
When you touch me like this
And when you hold me like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
Then we see what we want to see
All coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now

If you forgive me all this
If I forgive you all that
We forgive and forget
And it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
We see just what we want to see
All coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall, but it's all coming back to me now

359,"Last Night (From ""The Nutty Professor"")","[VERSE 1: MASTAMIND]
What the heck
Give me a mic check so I can wreck shit
Here I go again
So hit the deck quick
I like to kick shit that makes you wonder how
A devilish child
With the devil's style and profile
Something you never saw is now seen
With my X-ray vision I can see everything
It's like life on the big screen I'm viewing
Looking in from the outside is what I'm doing
Coming to you like a poetic Socrates
With the scientific method I'm dropping my hypotheses
I predict and pick the roads I walk on
Select and wreck every rhythm I talk on
So here's the flow that I dreamed last night
I was rapping to The Sandman
Cause even in my sleep I write
Nightmarish poetry
I'll say Mastamind's in the house
So you know it's me
I want to hit your mental telepathy with this rhyme
So I kick it one time for your mind

[VERSE 2: MASTAMIND]
This is definitely one to grow on
Your mind, body and soul grows as I flow on
Only if Einstein would have wrote rhymes
His name would have been The Unbeatable Mastamind
I ain't no hologram of your imagination
What would life be without a Reel Life creation?
Come and take a dose of this poisonous medicine
And once it sets in your fucking head spins
Ain't nothing wrong with addiction
As long as you're addicted to my words as I kick shit
I'm in the mood to raise and build
If the place ain't filled
It's cause all my people are getting killed
I think about life
I think about death
My mind flips and plays tricks on me as time ticks
I keep my eyes on the prize
And watch the clock steadily
And Rock It Deadly
One time for your mind

[VERSE 3: MASTAMIND]
Yours for you to enjoy and envy
The Devil is in me so I'm living in sin, see
Many many suckers burn for this
It's one time for your mind
So maybe you'll learn from this
You be the fool and I'll be the one to school
Haven't you heard
That street knowledge rules
I got a duty to build and bless you
When the lesson is done
Let The Nutty Professor test you
Get it in your head
Sing along to what I said
I gotta let cool wisdom be heard until I'm dead
Who knows where the bad guy goes
When he dies
I guess he's sent to Hell where he fries
Too bad I can't be headed for the skies
Time is up
It's too late
I already know my fate
I can't wait
'Til Judgment Day comes
When I can rock it in Hell over some Wicket bass drums
You learn about life and death for yourself
Fuck a role model
I'll preach it to you like a ghetto style Aristotle
You want to know like I know
Then wish upon a cross
But don't get lost, lost in the sauce
NATAS can be your saviors
How does the bloody flavor taste that I gave ya
Like a 3, 2, 1
The lesson is done

362,Hero Of The Day,"Now I'm on my way, I walk through the rain
Prevent every downfall on this world because you made
Me the hero of the day

Good morning, how's it going pretty little world
I am here just today, for everyone you hurt
Don't get me wrong, oh you are such an awesome place to live
But it is man and it is the way he thinks
It is his attitude and faith in nothing
Everyone believes that only miracles can change everything

And so they all need a wakeup call just to crash the walls
Which still surround their faith in nothing
So they all need a wakeup call just to crash the walls
Which still surround their faith in nothing

For them it seems impossible to make their dreams come true
They always need some evidence, a hero like me and you

What do you see when you look into my eyes
What do you feel when your mind connects with mine
I really hope you believe in me, you made me the hero of the day
Where will I be when darkness kills the light
Who will be there to save one thousand lives
Tomorrow we all will be, together the heroes of the day

There is not much inside us that has to be changed
But even a different way of thinking can change everything
If others do the same, you won't believe what we could achieve
We could create a new community with no heroes
Cause we're the heroes of the day

And so they all need a wakeup call just to crash the walls
Which still surround their faith in nothing
So they all need a wakeup call just to crash the walls
Which still surround their faith in nothing

For them it seems impossible to make their dreams come true
They always need some evidence, a hero like me and you

And he walked with a purpose in his sneakers down the street
He had many questions like children often do

[Chorus]
He said, tell me all your thoughts on God
Tell me am I very far?

[Verse 2]
Must have been late afternoon
On our way the sun broke free of the clouds
We count only blue cars, skip the cracks in the street
And ask many questions like children often do

[Chorus]
We said, tell me all your thoughts on God
Cause I would really like to meet her
And ask her why we're who we are
Tell me all your thoughts on God
Cause I am on my way to see her
So tell me am I very far, am I very far now?

[Verse 3]
It's getting cold picked up the pace
How our shoes make hard noises in this place
Our clothes are stained
We pass many cross-eyed people
And ask many questions like children often do

Tell me all your thoughts on God
Cause I would really like to meet her
And ask her why we're who we are
Tell me all your thoughts on God
Cause I am on my way to see her

Am I very far now, am I very far now, am I very far now?

When I walk out
You can slam the door
I’ll be the S.O.B
If that’s what you need from me
So you don’t have to love me anymore

I’ll let it all slide
Get ‘em all on your side
So you don’t have to love me anymore

I will keep
All those memories, of the good times
Yeah, there were some good times
So when you think
Of you and me
They won’t even cross your mind

Leads you to thinking
That you want what we had before
Girl you can call me
I’ll let it ring and ring

All those memories, of the good times

366,Street Dreams,"[Produced by Tracksmasters]

[Chorus]
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

[Verse 1]
My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square
Headed for Delaware with one change of gear
Nothing on my mind but the dime sack we blazed
With the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave
Dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print
Though I'm innocent 'til proven guilty
I'ma try to get filthy, purchase a club and start up a realty
For real G, I'ma fulfill my dream
If I conceal my scheme then precisely I'll build my cream
The first trip without the clique
Sent the bitch with the quarter brick, this is it
Fresh face, NY plates got a crooked eye for the Jakes
I want it all, ArmorAll Benz and endless papes
God sake, what a nigga got to do to make a half a million
Without the FBI catching feelings

[Chorus]
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

[Verse 2]
From Fat Cat to Pappy, niggas see the cat
Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back
Holding gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back
Living with Moms, getting it on, flushing crack down the toilet
Two sips from being alcoholic
Nine hundred ninety nine thou from being rich
But now I'm all for it
My man saw it like Dionne Warwick
A wiser team, for a wiser dream we could all score with
The cartel Argentina coke with the nina
Up in the hotel, smoking on Sessamina
Trina got the fishscale between her
The way the bitch shook her ass yo the dogs never seen her
She got me back living sweeter, fresh Caesar
Guess, David Robinson's, Wally moccasins
Bitches blow me while hopping in the drop-top BM
Word is bond son, I had that bitch down on my shit like this

[Chorus]
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

[Verse 3]
Growing up project-struck, looking for luck, dreaming
Scoping the large niggas beaming, check what I'm seeing
Cars, ghetto stars pushing ill Europeans
G'n, heard about them old timers OD'n
Young early 80's, throwing rocks at the crazy lady
Worshipping every word them rope-rocking niggas gave me
The street raised me up giving a fuck
I thought Jordans and a gold chain was living it up
I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts, everybody
Cut out of class, just to smoke blunts and drink noddy
Ain't that funny, getting put on to crack money
With all the gunplay, painting the kettle black hungry
A case of beers in the staircase I wasted years
Some niggas went for theirs, flipping coke as they career
But I'm a rebel stressing, to pull out of the heat no doubt
With Jeeps tinted out, spending never holding out

[Chorus]
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these

Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's

Can ya, Kenyatta, make sure they know before what is really in store
See I adore the ones that call me Torhi, true story
I created 'hood rats so these new mice bore me
See I normally settle for sevens, but eights I can't wait
Nines be wantin' time and dimes be wantin' dates
So know I got elevens and twelves
With at least thirteen or fourteen reasons why they fine as hell
I hit 'em up like Blu Cantrell

What's the point of havin' a girl that's drop dead
That you know don't like you?
She'll run over your head with a motorcycle
I mean the way you look is nice, but there's more to life boo
Cuz I could go to videos and get fo' just like you
I talked to your ex-boyfriend and took a census
But you don't read the cookbook, you just look at the pictures
Matter of fact, when's the last time you looked at the kitchen?
This is gettin' ridiculous, how you gettin' defensive?

I know you fuckin' around, my sixth sense told me

Too busy showing love
Why you steady take
Show you what's up in my heart
Let me meditate
But actions all I demonstrate
See that's ya problem I guess you'd just rather seal ya fate
New beginnings I stay winning from start
Women grinning I may start sinning look at the God
Not flashy
Still not one can pass me
Empty compliments but my drive is all that could gas me
Treasure to most, but some calling me trashy
I'm just to complex they ask me
How could you come from this class see
Well, I was student
Just watching em flashing
She said you think you just fancy
I told her woman don't sass me
Well, my resilience it mimics my brilliance
While I'm up in my feelings, I'm merely filling my millions
I mean up to the ceilings
Hey mama look at her chillins
When I'm finished I want em all to still give her this feeling
Oldest, but though I'm willing to shift all my focus to the youth it just seem like they hopeless
Through my music yes I'm talking to you
Yes I'm talking to the youth
Though I'm solo in this booth
Youngins still brush it off like they holding on to a tooth
Love em all hope my energy will transcend
And follow my words til this land end
I sat and visualized about all of this shit out on my landing
While I sip my coffee with butter and oh it's blended (Bulletproof)
My life is so splendid
Wronging my rights so it's rightful just how I spend it
Taught the rifle my best friend
Broken hearts never mended
Stay dolo in this world when you solo I recommend it
No loyalty fakes'll fold on you
Stay focused handle ya business
These haters come outta nowhere so fuck all that
Best friend shit
We either brothers or don't know each other
This world is crazy so let's grow together
I told her baby oh I'm feeling us
She said the distance really killing us
How could you say these things
Guess I'm riding this shit alone

I'm young, wild, and strapped like Chi-Ali
BLAOW, we ain't got nothing to worry about
Whoop ass, let security carry them out
Watch out for the medallion, my diamonds are reckless
It feels like a midget is hanging from my necklace
I pulled up with a million trucks
Looking, smelling, feeling like a million bucks, ahh
Pass the bottles, the heat is on
We in the huddle all smoking that Cheech & Chong
What's wrong? The club and the moon is full
And I'm looking for a thick, young lady to pull
One sure shot way to get them out of them pants
Take note to the brand new dance

Tell your little friend he can quit mean mugging
I'm lit and I don't care what no one thinks
But where the fuck is the waitress at with my drinks?
My people outside and they can't get in
We gon' rush the back door & break them in
The owner already pissed cause we sort of late
But our time and our clothes, got to coordinate
Most girls looking right, some looking a mess
That's why they spilling drinks all over your dress
But Louis Vuitton bras all over your breasts
Got me wanting to put hickeys all over your chest
Ahh, come on we gon' party tonight
Y'all use mouth to mouth bring the party to life
Don't be scared, show another part of your life
The more drinks in your system, the harder the fight

Get us out, so someone can gun us down

Do it now cause tomorrow ain't promised today
Work with me, let's become one with the beat

I said I take care of my kids but I'm flexin' on my baby mama
I'm like, ""Damn, I shoulda wore a condom!""
Boom, boom, boom

[Verse 1]
My shoes sold out in one day
Pull out the blueprint, bumpin' dat Gunplay
In a Maybach, pockets stay fat
So fly, I could parallel park on a fucking runway
Going down a one way the wrong way, shoot barrel long range
Swag like pro ball, gave her a ring, phone call
Money talk, pole vault, walked in, drove off
So comfortable at the dealership, I don't take my robe off
I wake up and I get to it, breakfast time I might sea food it
Lunch time I might lamb chop it
And you do is talk shit like you was eatin' booty
Southside in my bloodstream, smokin' on that propane
I could tell ya ass one thing, I like gettin' head wearing both chains
All white with no stains, I been trappin' fore the Grammy nods
I been countin' money so long I'mma need a damn hand massage
So many cars, I can barely park
So many cars, I need another damn garage
I'm famous with my fam around, damn I wish I had my dad around
Gave a nigga a Lamborghini, so that's a motherfuckin' lamb-me-down

[Chorus]
Watch how I'mma kill em for the summer
(Watch how I kill 'em)
Watch how I'mma kill em for the summer
(Watch how I kill 'em)

[Verse 2]
Aye, European style my dresscode, gunshots in the club echo
Walk around with a .36 with six shots in my .38 Special
Black car, black Timbs, Bank of America back then
She tryna tell me her life story and all I want is a lap dance
Good times, smokin' J's, rockin' J's, I'm the rap Ernie Barnes
If I paint a canvas it'd be melee, firearms
Viacom, maricón, if she bad I invite her home
Buying chains like I'm buyin' homes
Rims taller than Kevin Hart, Ride Along
Them rhinestones, you ain't shinin', nigga
I ain't hidin' so you ain't gotta find me, nigga
All my clothes are designer, nigga
And my back seat recliner nigga
Came in rockin' all gold and I'm fuckin' all yall hoes
Smokin' on that Lee Haney, sippin' on that hard-boiled
This that get back - click clack, get back
Smokin' on Raw paper, this ain't zig zags
Snakeskin wallpaper, rose gold chandelier
I'm lookin' for a baby eater, can I get a volunteer?

Watch how I'mma kill em for the summer

376,You Learn/You Oughta Know,"[Intro]
If ignorance is bliss then I'm fucking suffering
Bring on the heat bitch I love the game
This plane is plain wrong hold on to the string
No need to preach I've reached the pinnacle
Ok cool come follow me
Leave your suitcase it'll just get in the way
Everything's the way that it oughta be, we'll that's the theory
A little vex, with mix of cynical

[Verse 1]
Bass booming ruin the mood of neighbors a lot
Knocking on my door but I ignore 'em enormous amounts
Of that loud, quiet down we ain't running out
No time soon, consume the fumes of the fowl
Fool, the young mind is so malleable
Moldable, roll it into a blunt to be blunt with you
Priorities, to tease the youth and keep the truth
Pry open the bag, I finna bag me a beauty
The tree to free me from anxiety
Inside of me, a meet and greet with Mr. king of misery
Unleash the apathy I'm actually, done with the wrong and the rules
Kon is commutable
We're sharing the same particle

Strings longer than dreads on a rasta
You need to be higher to grasp the
Significance of the cancer
Causing you to close your third eye

[Bridge]
The two that you're using to rely, lies
Enlightenment the founder of truth, youth
Eternal learn you oughta be wise, I
Supersymmetry of the two, who
Owns the guitar tuning the tune, who's
Plucking each note toting the loom, who
Arranged the composition of you, who's
Smoking the potent herb in the room

""You know you fucked up right?
Look
You can't shoulder the whole world's sins
Listen""

[Verse 2]
I used to be the musician wearing the suit (Show)
I went to war, I was unstoppable (War)
Did some things, but I paid my dues (Karma)
Even the devil couldn't collect my soul (Grim)
Had to fight my way out of limbo (Limbo)
But ended up in a place quite remote (Judgment)
I must say these confines I'm not fond of
I really hope that Kon finds a place to go
A place to roam a place to stroll
I'm looking straight into the face of holy
Judge and jury face the fury
When the gavel hits the block I'm doomed
Well damn, it was fun while it lasted man
My story shall remain history in the museum
Stupid string theories and abstract thoughts
The fuck was I thinking it would be enough
Just hurry up and send me away
I was getting tired anyway...",Kon Kyoshi,1997,"[41, 36, 36, 31, 31, 40, 40]",7
377,What Kind Of Man Would I Be,"[Intro]
You know
We can't do this
We just can't
Listen

[Verse 1]
You say you feel disenchanted
Cause lately he takes you for granted
Still faithful and true you remained and
To hurt so have I
You pour out your heart and I listen
And we catch a vibe reminiscing
Temptations so strong not to mention
The yearning inside

[Hook]
But what kind of man would I be
If I lived unfaithfully
And what kind of girl would you be
If you did the same
Cause I don't wanna see her cry
And you don't need a reason to lie
Cause if we laid down tonight
It won't justify throwing love aside

[Verse 2]
This feeling is strong and we know it
But we gotta see past the moment
There's too much to lose if we blow it
This is no lie
Still, here we are both together
With promises made that we never
Yet feeling it now more than ever
I can't deny

[Hook]
But what kind of man would I be
If I lived unfaithfully
And what kind of girl would you be
If you did the same
Cause I don't wanna see her cry
And you don't need a reason to lie
Cause if we laid down tonight
It won't justify throwing love aside

[Bridge]
Here we are all alone
But somehow we've got to stay strong

[Hook]
But what kind of man would I be
If I lived unfaithfully
And what kind of girl would you be
If you did the same
Cause I don't wanna see her cry
And you don't need a reason to lie
Cause if we laid down tonight
It won't justify throwing love aside

I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'

You said you care, and you missed me too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you
And the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause I know we've ran out of things we can say

What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'

And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again

What am I now? What am I now?
What if you're someone I just want around?

In the end, it's stronger
Than I know how to be
And I can't just spend
My whole lifetime wondering
I fell in love with the sound
Of my heels on the wooden floor
I don't want our footsteps
To be silent anymore

Want them to be in the moment

381,Nowhere To Go,"[Intro: Sample]
Are you alone?
No one's out here
Are you alone?
No one's out here

[Verse 1]
Same day, started as the last one
Nothin' changed, kind of hoping it's a fast one
Now my mates man, I hardly ever see 'em
I know they feel I changed but I'm feelin' like I'm dreamin'
Now when we drink up, we reminisce and laugh
I'm feelin' bad, I'm out it but they still stuck in the raw
Weighin' drugs on a scale just to pay bills
Plus the boys doing time, how do they feel
No matter what, I am stuck in the gutter
Money can't change shit, it's my brain motherfucker
If I had enough bills, I'd get all the crew fed
But I gotta feed the fam and remember you said
You had my back, well I'm needing the support
Try and move but I crash, plus I'm fiendin' just to talk
Nobody want to listen so I'm walking these dead streets
Feeling like the only thing that knows is a Nebs beat
What the fuck you thinking, 'cause I got fans now
That I don't need your help? Fuck, I'm putting the pen down
Wait I can't do that, 'cause that's the shit right
This the medicine that's going to save a kid's life
But I talk about drugs, so now I'm no good
Show your parents what the fuck around your own hood
Then maybe just maybe you'll fucking understand why
And hate me but rate me and the exact same time, 'cause I

[Hook]
Feel alone like there's nowhere to go
I try to find a home but I'm back on the road
Another mate rang but I missed the call
So you can use your fuckin' brain but you ain't thinkin' at all
And yeah, I feel alone like there's nowhere to go
I try to find a home but I'm back on the road
Another mate rang but I missed the call
So you can use your fuckin' brain but you ain't thinkin' at all

[Verse 2]
I could be drug fucked, that would make sense
You try to hold the weight I'm holding, it would break legs
Cones that I've packed, every tab that I've popped
On the phone to my dad, but he don't know that I'm lost
'Cause I play it all good, no one needs to know shit
Don't know if I should, don't know why I wrote this
Feeling so confused, why the fans showin' love?
Why I'm writing shit like this, does it mean I'm growing up?
If that's the fucking case, I'd rather feelin' like a kid again
When we was running mucks I probably had them people listenin'
Nowadays, it's not the same, or tell me is this what the fame
Is doing to my brain? I've gone insane, I need a doctor mate
I got a lot at stake, I gotta stop it ayy
They tell me drop the pills, I end up fuckin' popping eight
I got my girl and thank fuck for that
I love her, need her 'cause I'm losin' all my trust in rap
Plus she found my fucking stash and she flushed it down the toilet
Next day, I went and scored, don't talk about it, I avoid it
Where to go? What to do? 'Cause I'm lost, what?
Now these haters gonna use it as a soft spot
But what's not to say that you is not the same
Somehow I'm in my right mind but I lost my brain
That's my heart, sittin' served up on the paper
I fucked up and saved nothin' for later

[Hook]
Feel alone like there's nowhere to go
I try to find a home but I'm back on the road
Another mate rang but I missed the call
So you can use your fuckin' brain but you ain't thinkin' at all

I can feel the time closing in
I can feel the years crawling through my skin
And if I doubt myself I can count on the rain
To cover the tears of this aging game
But I can count on you to play your part
I don't miss a beat of your animal heart
And when you push from behind I know I can
Cover a mountain with the palm of my hand

[Chorus]
And oh babe, you can make history young again
You could rewrite, you could decide
The things that should or shouldn't have been
You could look at me in the scheme of things
Oh oh babe, you could make history young again

[Verse 2]
I can watch the weeks sweeping by
I can recollect the hearts hanging out to dry
When the world shuts down I can touch my fears
I can hear lost youth ringing in my ears
But I lost nothing when I gained you
You just blew me away with yesterdays news
When you run your fingers down my spine
It's like throwing a switch on the hands of time

Got a way of coming around

I found a guy, told me I was a star
He held the door, held my hand in the dark
And he's perfect on paper, but he's lying to my face
Does he think that I'm the kinda girl who needs to be saved?

[Verse 2]
And there's one more boy, he's from my past
We fell in love, but it didn't last
'Cause the second I figure it out, he pushes me away
And I won't fight for love if you won't meet me halfway
And I say that I'm through, but this song's still for you

[Chorus]
All I want is love that lasts
Is all I want too much to ask?
Is it something wrong with me?
All I want is a good guy
Are my expectations far too high?
Try my best, but what can I say?
All I have is myself at the end of the day
But shouldn't that be enough for me?

[Bridge]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
And I miss the days when I was young and naive
I thought the perfect guy would come and find me
Now happy ever after, it don't come so easily

All I want is love that lasts
Is all I want too much to ask?
Is it something wrong with me? Oh, ooh

389,Birmingham,"My Dear Fellow Clergymen:

While confined here in the Birmingham city jail, I came across your recent statement calling my present activities ""unwise and untimely."" Seldom do I pause to answer criticism of my work and ideas. If I sought to answer all the criticisms that cross my desk, my secretaries would have little time for anything other than such correspondence in the course of the day, and I would have no time for constructive work. But since I feel that you are men of genuine good will and that your criticisms are sincerely set forth, I want to try to answer your statements in what I hope will be patient and reasonable terms.

I think I should indicate why I am here in Birmingham, since you have been influenced by the view which argues against ""outsiders coming in."" I have the honor of serving as president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, an organization operating in every southern state, with headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. We have some eighty-five affiliated organizations across the South, and one of them is the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights. Frequently we share staff, educational and financial resources with our affiliates. Several months ago the affiliate here in Birmingham asked us to be on call to engage in a nonviolent direct-action program if such were deemed necessary. We readily consented, and when the hour came we lived up to our promise. So I, along with several members of my staff, am here because I was invited here I am here because I have organizational ties here.

But more basically, I am in Birmingham because injustice is here. Just as the prophets of the eighth century B.C. left their villages and carried their ""thus saith the Lord"" far beyond the boundaries of their home towns, and just as the Apostle Paul left his village of Tarsus and carried the gospel of Jesus Christ to the far corners of the Greco-Roman world, so am I compelled to carry the gospel of freedom beyond my own home town. Like Paul, I must constantly respond to the Macedonian call for aid.

Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial ""outside agitator"" idea. Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere within its bounds.

You deplore the demonstrations taking place in Birmingham. But your statement, I am sorry to say, fails to express a similar concern for the conditions that brought about the demonstrations. I am sure that none of you would want to rest content with the superficial kind of social analysis that deals merely with effects and does not grapple with underlying causes. It is unfortunate that demonstrations are taking place in Birmingham, but it is even more unfortunate that the city's white power structure left the Negro community with no alternative.

In any nonviolent campaign there are four basic steps: collection of the facts to determine whether injustices exist; negotiation; self-purification; and direct action. We have gone through all these steps in Birmingham. There can be no gainsaying the fact that racial injustice engulfs this community. Birmingham is probably the most thoroughly segregated city in the United States. Its ugly record of brutality is widely known. Negroes have experienced grossly unjust treatment in the courts. There have been more unsolved bombings of Negro homes and churches in Birmingham than in any other city in the nation. These are the hard, brutal facts of the case. On the basis of these conditions, Negro leaders sought to negotiate with the city fathers. But the latter consistently refused to engage in good-faith negotiation.

Then, last September, came the opportunity to talk with leaders of Birmingham's economic community. In the course of the negotiations, certain promises were made by the merchants--for example, to remove the stores' humiliating racial signs. On the basis of these promises, the Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth and the leaders of the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights agreed to a moratorium on all demonstrations. As the weeks and months went by, we realized that we were the victims of a broken promise. A few signs, briefly removed, returned; the others remained.

As in so many past experiences, our hopes had been blasted, and the shadow of deep disappointment settled upon us. We had no alternative except to prepare for direct action, whereby we would present our very bodies as a means of laying our case before the conscience of the local and the national community. Mindful of the difficulties involved, we decided to undertake a process of self-purification. We began a series of workshops on nonviolence, and we repeatedly asked ourselves: ""Are you able to accept blows without retaliating?"" ""Are you able to endure the ordeal of jail?"" We decided to schedule our direct-action program for the Easter season, realizing that except for Christmas, this is the main shopping period of the year. Knowing that a strong economic withdrawal program would be the by-product of direct action, we felt that this would be the best time to bring pressure to bear on the merchants for the needed change.

Then it occurred to us that Birmingham's mayoralty election was coming up in March, and we speedily decided to postpone action until after election day. When we discovered that the Commissioner of Public Safety, Eugene ""Bull"" Connor, had piled up enough votes to be in the run-off, we decided again to postpone action until the day after the run-off so that the demonstrations could not be used to cloud the issues. Like many others, we waited to see Mr. Connor defeated, and to this end we endured postponement after postponement. Having aided in this community need, we felt that our direct-action program could be delayed no longer.

You may well ask: ""Why direct action? Why sit-ins, marches and so forth? Isn't negotiation a better path?"" You are quite right in calling for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word ""tension."" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, so must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.

The purpose of our direct-action program is to create a situation so crisis-packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation. I therefore concur with you in your call for negotiation. Too long has our beloved Southland been bogged down in a tragic effort to live in monologue rather than dialogue.

One of the basic points in your statement is that the action that I and my associates have taken in Birmingham is untimely. Some have asked: ""Why didn't you give the new city administration time to act?"" The only answer that I can give to this query is that the new Birmingham administration must be prodded about as much as the outgoing one, before it will act. We are sadly mistaken if we feel that the election of Albert Boutwell as mayor will bring the millennium to Birmingham. While Mr. Boutwell is a much more gentle person than Mr. Connor, they are both segregationists, dedicated to maintenance of the status quo. I have hope that Mr. Boutwell will be reasonable enough to see the futility of massive resistance to desegregation. But he will not see this without pressure from devotees of civil rights. My friends, I must say to you that we have not made a single gain in civil rights without determined legal and nonviolent pressure. Lamentably, it is an historical fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily. Individuals may see the moral light and voluntarily give up their unjust posture; but, as Reinhold Niebuhr has reminded us, groups tend to be more immoral than individuals.

We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed. Frankly, I have yet to engage in a direct-action campaign that was ""well timed"" in the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation. For years now I have heard the word ""Wait!"" It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This ""Wait"" has almost always meant ""Never."" We must come to see, with one of our distinguished jurists, that ""justice too long delayed is justice denied.""

We have waited for more than 340 years for our constitutional and God-given rights. The nations of Asia and Africa are moving with jetlike speed toward gaining political independence, but we still creep at horse-and-buggy pace toward gaining a cup of coffee at a lunch counter. Perhaps it is easy for those who have never felt the stinging darts of segregation to say, ""Wait."" But when you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate-filled policemen curse, kick and even kill your black brothers and sisters; when you see the vast majority of your twenty million Negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society; when you suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your six-year-old daughter why she can't go to the public amusement park that has just been advertised on television, and see tears welling up in her eyes when she is told that Funtown is closed to colored children, and see ominous clouds of inferiority beginning to form in her little mental sky, and see her beginning to distort her personality by developing an unconscious bitterness toward white people; when you have to concoct an answer for a five-year-old son who is asking: ""Daddy, why do white people treat colored people so mean?""; when you take a cross-county drive and find it necessary to sleep night after night in the uncomfortable corners of your automobile because no motel will accept you; when you are humiliated day in and day out by nagging signs reading ""white"" and ""colored""; when your first name becomes ""nigger,"" your middle name becomes ""boy"" (however old you are) and your last name becomes ""John,"" and your wife and mother are never given the respected title ""Mrs.""; when you are harried by day and haunted by night by the fact that you are a Negro, living constantly at tiptoe stance, never quite knowing what to expect next, and are plagued with inner fears and outer resentments; when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense of ""nobodiness""--then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait. There comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over, and men are no longer willing to be plunged into the abyss of despair. I hope, sirs, you can understand our legitimate and unavoidable impatience.

You express a great deal of anxiety over our willingness to break laws. This is certainly a legitimate concern. Since we so diligently urge people to obey the Supreme Court's decision of 1954 outlawing segregation in the public schools, at first glance it may seem rather paradoxical for us consciously to break laws. One may well ask: ""How can you advocate breaking some laws and obeying others?"" The answer lies in the fact that there are two types of laws: just and unjust. I would be the first to advocate obeying just laws. One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws. I would agree with St. Augustine that ""an unjust law is no law at all.""

Now, what is the difference between the two? How does one determine whether a law is just or unjust? A just law is a man-made code that squares with the moral law or the law of God. An unjust law is a code that is out of harmony with the moral law. To put it in the terms of St. Thomas Aquinas: An unjust law is a human law that is not rooted in eternal law and natural law. Any law that uplifts human personality is just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust. All segregation statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality. It gives the segregator a false sense of superiority and the segregated a false sense of inferiority. Segregation, to use the terminology of the Jewish philosopher Martin Buber, substitutes an ""I-it"" relationship for an ""I-thou"" relationship and ends up relegating persons to the status of things. Hence segregation is not only politically, economically and sociologically unsound, it is morally wrong and sinful. Paul Tillich has said that sin is separation. Is not segregation an existential expression of man's tragic separation, his awful estrangement, his terrible sinfulness? Thus it is that I can urge men to obey the 1954 decision of the Supreme Court, for it is morally right; and I can urge them to disobey segregation ordinances, for they are morally wrong.

Let us consider a more concrete example of just and unjust laws. An unjust law is a code that a numerical or power majority group compels a minority group to obey but does not make binding on itself. This is difference made legal. By the same token, a just law is a code that a majority compels a minority to follow and that it is willing to follow itself. This is sameness made legal.

Let me give another explanation. A law is unjust if it is inflicted on a minority that, as a result of being denied the right to vote, had no part in enacting or devising the law. Who can say that the legislature of Alabama which set up that state's segregation laws was democratically elected?

Throughout Alabama all sorts of devious methods are used to prevent Negroes from becoming registered voters, and there are some counties in which, even though Negroes constitute a majority of the population, not a single Negro is registered. Can any law enacted under such circumstances be considered democratically structured?

Sometimes a law is just on its face and unjust in its application. For instance, I have been arrested on a charge of parading without a permit. Now, there is nothing wrong in having an ordinance which requires a permit for a parade. But such an ordinance becomes unjust when it is used to maintain segregation and to deny citizens the First-Amendment privilege of peaceful assembly and protest.

I hope you are able to see the distinction I am trying to point out. In no sense do I advocate evading or defying the law, as would the rabid segregationist. That would lead to anarchy. One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the penalty. I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law.

Of course, there is nothing new about this kind of civil disobedience. It was evidenced sublimely in the refusal of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego to obey the laws of Nebuchadnezzar, on the ground that a higher moral law was at stake. It was practiced superbly by the early Christians, who were willing to face hungry lions and the excruciating pain of chopping blocks rather than submit to certain unjust laws of the Roman Empire. To a degree, academic freedom is a reality today because Socrates practiced civil disobedience. In our own nation, the Boston Tea Party represented a massive act of civil disobedience.

We should never forget that everything Adolf Hitler did in Germany was ""legal"" and everything the Hungarian freedom fighters did in Hungary was ""illegal."" It was ""illegal"" to aid and comfort a Jew in Hitler's Germany. Even so, I am sure that, had I lived in Germany at the time, I would have aided and comforted my Jewish brothers. If today I lived in a Communist country where certain principles dear to the Christian faith are suppressed, I would openly advocate disobeying that country's antireligious laws.

I must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action""; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a ""more convenient season."" Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.

I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress. I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative peace, in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight, to a substantive and positive peace, in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human personality. Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with. Like a boil that can never be cured so long as it is covered up but must be opened with all its ugliness to the natural medicines of air and light, injustice must be exposed, with all the tension its exposure creates, to the light of human conscience and the air of national opinion before it can be cured.

In your statement you assert that our actions, even though peaceful, must be condemned because they precipitate violence. But is this a logical assertion? Isn't this like condemning a robbed man because his possession of money precipitated the evil act of robbery? Isn't this like condemning Socrates because his unswerving commitment to truth and his philosophical inquiries precipitated the act by the misguided populace in which they made him drink hemlock? Isn't this like condemning Jesus because his unique God-consciousness and never-ceasing devotion to God's will precipitated the evil act of crucifixion? We must come to see that, as the federal courts have consistently affirmed, it is wrong to urge an individual to cease his efforts to gain his basic constitutional rights because the quest may precipitate violence. Society must protect the robbed and punish the robber.

I had also hoped that the white moderate would reject the myth concerning time in relation to the struggle for freedom. I have just received a letter from a white brother in Texas. He writes: ""All Christians know that the colored people will receive equal rights eventually, but it is possible that you are in too great a religious hurry. It has taken Christianity almost two thousand years to accomplish what it has. The teachings of Christ take time to come to earth."" Such an attitude stems from a tragic misconception of time, from the strangely irrational notion that there is something in the very flow of time that will inevitably cure all ills. Actually, time itself is neutral; it can be used either destructively or constructively. More and more I feel that the people of ill will have used time much more effectively than have the people of good will. We will have to repent in this generation not merely for the hateful words and actions of the bad people but for the appalling silence of the good people. Human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to be co-workers with God, and without this hard work, time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social stagnation. We must use time creatively, in the knowledge that the time is always ripe to do right. Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy and transform our pending national elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood. Now is the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity.

You speak of our activity in Birmingham as extreme. At first I was rather disappointed that fellow clergymen would see my nonviolent efforts as those of an extremist. I began thinking about the fact that I stand in the middle of two opposing forces in the Negro community. One is a force of complacency, made up in part of Negroes who, as a result of long years of oppression, are so drained of self-respect and a sense of ""somebodiness"" that they have adjusted to segregation; and in part of a few middle-class Negroes who, because of a degree of academic and economic security

And because in some ways they profit by segregation, have become insensitive to the problems of the masses. The other force is one of bitterness and hatred, and it comes perilously close to advocating violence. It is expressed in the various black nationalist groups that are springing up across the nation, the largest and best-known being Elijah Muhammad's Muslim movement. Nourished by the Negro's frustration over the continued existence of racial discrimination, this movement is made up of people who have lost faith in America, who have absolutely repudiated Christianity, and who have concluded that the white man is an incorrigible ""devil.""

I have tried to stand between these two forces, saying that we need emulate neither the ""do-nothingism"" of the complacent nor the hatred and despair of the black nationalist. For there is the more excellent way of love and nonviolent protest. I am grateful to God that, through the influence of the Negro church, the way of nonviolence became an integral part of our struggle.

If this philosophy had not emerged, by now many streets of the South would, I am convinced, be flowing with blood. And I am further convinced that if our white brothers dismiss as ""rabble-rousers"" and ""outside agitators"" those of us who employ nonviolent direct action, and if they refuse to support our nonviolent efforts, millions of Negroes will, out of frustration and despair, seek solace and security in black-nationalist ideologies--a development that would inevitably lead to a frightening racial nightmare.

Oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever. The yearning for freedom eventually manifests itself, and that is what has happened to the American Negro. Something within has reminded him of his birthright of freedom, and something without has reminded him that it can be gained. Consciously or unconsciously, he has been caught up by the Zeitgeist, and with his black brothers of Africa and his brown and yellow brothers of Asia, South America and the Caribbean, the United States Negro is moving with a sense of great urgency toward the promised land of racial justice. If one recognizes this vital urge that has engulfed the Negro community, one should readily understand why public demonstrations are taking place. The Negro has many pent-up resentments and latent frustrations, and he must release them. So let him march; let him make prayer pilgrimages to the city hall; let him go on freedom rides--and try to understand why he must do so. If his repressed emotions are not released in nonviolent ways, they will seek expression through violence; this is not a threat but a fact of history. So I have not said to my people: ""Get rid of your discontent."" Rather, I have tried to say that this normal and healthy discontent can be channeled into the creative outlet of nonviolent direct action. And now this approach is being termed extremist.

But though I was initially disappointed at being categorized as an extremist, as I continued to think about the matter I gradually gained a measure of satisfaction from the label. Was not Jesus an extremist for love: ""Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you."" Was not Amos an extremist for justice: ""Let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream."" Was not Paul an extremist for the Christian gospel: ""I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus."" Was not Martin Luther an extremist: ""Here I stand; I cannot do otherwise, so help me God."" And John Bunyan: ""I will stay in jail to the end of my days before I make a butchery of my conscience."" And Abraham Lincoln: ""This nation cannot survive half slave and half free."" And Thomas Jefferson: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal . . ."" So the question is not whether we will be extremists, but what kind of extremists we will be. Will we be extremists for hate or for love? Will we be extremist for the preservation of injustice or for the extension of justice?

In that dramatic scene on Calvary's hill three men were crucified. We must never forget that all three were crucified for the same crime--the crime of extremism. Two were extremists for immorality, and thus fell below their environment. The other, Jesus Christ, was an extremist for love, truth and goodness, and thereby rose above his environment. Perhaps the South, the nation and the world are in dire need of creative extremists.

I had hoped that the white moderate would see this need. Perhaps I was too optimistic; perhaps I expected too much. I suppose I should have realized that few members of the oppressor race can understand the deep groans and passionate yearnings of the oppressed race, and still fewer have the vision to see that injustice must be rooted out by strong, persistent and determined action. I am thankful, however, that some of our white brothers in the South have grasped the meaning of this social revolution and committed themselves to it. They are still too few in quantity, but they are big in quality. Some--such as Ralph McGill, Lillian Smith, Harry Golden, James McBride Dabbs, Ann Braden and Sarah Patton Boyle--have written about our struggle in eloquent and prophetic terms. Others have marched with us down nameless streets of the South. They have languished in filthy, roach-infested jails, suffering the abuse and brutality of policemen who view them as ""dirty nigger-lovers."" Unlike so many of their moderate brothers and sisters, they have recognized the urgency of the moment and sensed the need for powerful ""action"" antidotes to combat the disease of segregation.

Let me take note of my other major disappointment. I have been so greatly disappointed with the white church and its leadership. Of course, there are some notable exceptions. I am not unmindful of the fact that each of you has taken some significant stands on this issue. I commend you, Reverend Stallings, for your Christian stand on this past Sunday, in welcoming Negroes to your worship service on a nonsegregated basis. I commend the Catholic leaders of this state for integrating Spring Hill College several years ago.

But despite these notable exceptions, I must honestly reiterate that I have been disappointed with the church. I do not say this as one of those negative critics who can always find something wrong with the church. I say this as a minister of the gospel, who loves the church; who was nurtured in its bosom; who has been sustained by its spiritual blessings and who will remain true to it as long as the cord of life shall lengthen.

When I was suddenly catapulted into the leadership of the bus protest in Montgomery, Alabama, a few years ago, I felt we would be supported by the white church. I felt that the white ministers, priests and rabbis of the South would be among our strongest allies. Instead, some have been outright opponents, refusing to understand the freedom movement and misrepresenting its leaders; all too many others have been more cautious than courageous and have remained silent behind the anesthetizing security of stained-glass windows.

In spite of my shattered dreams, I came to Birmingham with the hope that the white religious leadership of this community would see the justice of our cause and, with deep moral concern, would serve as the channel through which our just grievances could reach the power structure. I had hoped that each of you would understand. But again I have been disappointed.

I have heard numerous southern religious leaders admonish their worshipers to comply with a desegregation decision because it is the law, but I have longed to hear white ministers declare: ""Follow this decree because integration is morally right and because the Negro is your brother."" In

The midst of blatant injustices inflicted upon the Negro, I have watched white churchmen stand on the sideline and mouth pious irrelevancies and sanctimonious trivialities. In the midst of a mighty struggle to rid our nation of racial and economic injustice, I have heard many ministers say: ""Those are social issues, with which the gospel has no real concern."" And I have watched many churches commit themselves to a completely other-worldly religion which makes a strange, un-Biblical distinction between body and soul, between the sacred and the secular.

I have traveled the length and breadth of Alabama, Mississippi and all the other southern states. On sweltering summer days and crisp autumn mornings I have looked at the South's beautiful churches with their lofty spires pointing heavenward. I have beheld the impressive outlines of her massive religious-education buildings. Over and over I have found myself asking: ""What kind of people worship here? Who is their God? Where were their voices when the lips of Governor Barnett dripped with words of interposition and nullification? Where were they when Governor Wallace gave a clarion call for defiance and hatred? Where were their voices of support when bruised and weary Negro men and women decided to rise from the dark dungeons of complacency to the bright hills of creative protest?""

Yes, these questions are still in my mind. In deep disappointment I have wept over the laxity of the church. But be assured that my tears have been tears of love. There can be no deep disappointment where there is not deep love. Yes, I love the church. How could I do otherwise? I am in the rather unique position of being the son, the grandson and the great-grandson of preachers. Yes, I see the church as the body of Christ. But, oh! How we have blemished and scarred that body through social neglect and through fear of being nonconformists.

There was a time when the church was very powerful--in the time when the early Christians rejoiced at being deemed worthy to suffer for what they believed. In those days the church was not merely a thermometer that recorded the ideas and principles of popular opinion; it was a thermostat that transformed the mores of society. Whenever the early Christians entered a town, the people in power became disturbed and immediately sought to convict the Christians for being ""disturbers of the peace"" and ""outside agitators""' But the Christians pressed on, in the conviction that they were ""a colony of heaven,"" called to obey God rather than man. Small in number, they were big in commitment. They were too God-intoxicated to be ""astronomically intimidated."" By their effort and example they brought an end to such ancient evils as infanticide and gladiatorial contests.

Things are different now. So often the contemporary church is a weak, ineffectual voice with an uncertain sound. So often it is an archdefender of the status quo. Far from being disturbed by the presence of the church, the power structure of the average community is consoled by the church's silent--and often even vocal--sanction of things as they are.

But the judgment of God is upon the church as never before. If today's church does not recapture the sacrificial spirit of the early church, it will lose its authenticity, forfeit the loyalty of millions, and be dismissed as an irrelevant social club with no meaning for the twentieth century. Every day I meet young people whose disappointment with the church has turned into outright disgust.

Perhaps I have once again been too optimistic. Is organized religion too inextricably bound to the status quo to save our nation and the world? Perhaps I must turn my faith to the inner spiritual church, the church within the church, as the true ekklesia and the hope of the world. But again I am thankful to God that some noble souls from the ranks of organized religion have broken loose from

The paralyzing chains of conformity and joined us as active partners in the struggle for freedom. They have left their secure congregations and walked the streets of Albany, Georgia, with us. They have gone down the highways of the South on tortuous rides for freedom. Yes, they have gone to jail with us. Some have been dismissed from their churches, have lost the support of their bishops and fellow ministers. But they have acted in the faith that right defeated is stronger than evil triumphant. Their witness has been the spiritual salt that has preserved the true meaning of the gospel in these troubled times. They have carved a tunnel of hope through the dark mountain of disappointment.

I hope the church as a whole will meet the challenge of this decisive hour. But even if the church does not come to the aid of justice, I have no despair about the future. I have no fear about the outcome of our struggle in Birmingham, even if our motives are at present misunderstood. We will reach the goal of freedom in Birmingham and all over the nation, because the goal of America is freedom. Abused and scorned though we may be, our destiny is tied up with America's destiny. Before the pilgrims landed at Plymouth, we were here. Before the pen of Jefferson etched the majestic words of the Declaration of Independence across the pages of history, we were here. For more than two centuries our forebears labored in this country without wages; they made cotton king; they built the homes of their masters while suffering gross injustice and shameful humiliation--and yet out of a bottomless vitality they continued to thrive and develop. If the inexpressible cruelties of slavery could not stop us, the opposition we now face will surely fail. We will win our freedom because the sacred heritage of our nation and the eternal will of God are embodied in our echoing demands*.*

Before closing I feel impelled to mention one other point in your statement that has troubled me profoundly. You warmly commended the Birmingham police force for keeping ""order"" and ""preventing violence."" I doubt that you would have so warmly commended the police force if you had seen its dogs sinking their teeth into unarmed, nonviolent Negroes. I doubt that you would so quickly commend the policemen if you were to observe their ugly and inhumane treatment of Negroes here in the city jail; if you were to watch them push and curse old Negro women and young Negro girls; if you were to see them slap and kick old Negro men and young boys; if you were to observe them, as they did on two occasions, refuse to give us food because we wanted to sing our grace together. I cannot join you in your praise of the Birmingham police department.

It is true that the police have exercised a degree of discipline in handling the demonstrators. In this sense they have conducted themselves rather ""nonviolently"" in public. But for what purpose? To preserve the evil system of segregation. Over the past few years I have consistently preached that nonviolence demands that the means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek. I have tried to make clear that it is wrong to use immoral means to attain moral ends. But now I must affirm that it is just as wrong, or perhaps even more so, to use moral means to preserve immoral ends. Perhaps Mr. Connor and his policemen have been rather nonviolent in public, as was Chief Pritchett in Albany, Georgia, but they have used the moral means of nonviolence to maintain the immoral end of racial injustice. As T. S. Eliot has said: ""The last temptation is the greatest treason: To do the right deed for the wrong reason.""

I wish you had commended the Negro sit-inners and demonstrators of Birmingham for their sublime courage, their willingness to suffer and their amazing discipline in the midst of great provocation. One day the South will recognize its real heroes. They will be the James Merediths, with the noble sense of purpose that enables them to face jeering, and hostile mobs, and with the agonizing loneliness that characterizes the life of the pioneer. They will be old, oppressed, battered Negro women, symbolized in a seventy-two-year-old woman in Montgomery, Alabama, who rose up with a sense of dignity and with her people decided not to ride segregated buses, and who responded with ungrammatical profundity to one who inquired about her weariness: ""My feets is tired, but my soul is at rest."" They will be the young high school and college students, the young ministers of the gospel and a host of their elders, courageously and nonviolently sitting in at lunch counters and willingly going to jail for conscience' sake. One day the South will know that when these disinherited children of God sat down at lunch counters, they were in reality standing up for what is best in the American dream and for the most sacred values in our Judaeo-Christian heritage, thereby bringing our nation back to those great wells of democracy which were dug deep by the founding fathers in their formulation of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.

Never before have I written so long a letter. I'm afraid it is much too long to take your precious time. I can assure you that it would have been much shorter if I had been writing from a comfortable desk, but what else can one do when he is alone in a narrow jail cell, other than write long letters, think long thoughts and pray long prayers?

If I have said anything in this letter that overstates the truth and indicates an unreasonable impatience, I beg you to forgive me. If I have said anything that understates the truth and indicates my having a patience that allows me to settle for anything less than brotherhood, I beg God to forgive me.

I hope this letter finds you strong in the faith. I also hope that circumstances will soon make it possible for me to meet each of you, not as an integrationist or a civil rights leader but as a fellow clergyman and a Christian brother. Let us all hope that the dark clouds of racial prejudice will soon pass away and the deep fog of misunderstanding will be lifted from our fear-drenched communities, and in some not too distant tomorrow the radiant stars of love and brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their scintillating beauty.

390,At Night I Pray,"So alone
And this room feels so cold
No one to care and no one to hold
Yeah, the Lord knows

Can you see the passion burning in my eyes?
Do you sense the rush you give my heart
And if you knew the secret way I feel for you
Would you come running to me or would you turn away?

At night I pray

As I lay me down to sleep
I pray together we will be
And there will come a time

You'll be mine
All mine
And I'll be yours always
But until that day comes
At night I pray

Should I feel these emotions inside me
Should I reveal what's locked up in my soul
I'm so afraid
But it's something that you've got to know

How I want to touch you every time you're near
I long to feel your body next to mine
And if you knew the secret love I have for you
Would you come running to me or would you turn away?

At night I pray
With hope and faith
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray together we will be
And there will come a time

You'll be mine

If all my prayers were answered
Our hearts would be enraptured
We would find our heaven inside each other's arms
This lonely room would finally see the sun shine through

But until that day
Every night I'll pray
I'll get down on my knees
I'll get down on my knees and pray...

At night I pray
With hope and faith
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray together we will be
And there will come a time

393,"Tell Me (From ""Eddie"")","[Verse One]
In the December of '81, way before rhyme was relevant
A child was born during a winter storm to Evelyn
My pops was Eddie, I don't really think he was ready
The nigga left me damn near as I came out the belly
From what they tell me from day one, I have always been heavy
Now weight wise, they say I have been here already
I'm starting to believe 'em
Sparking my weed and I'm coughing and wheezing
I talk with demons
Ghost and gremlins, swear to God I see 'em
In the back of my mind, I travel back and through time
When I was nine and I would practice this rhyme
But my step pops said ""Stop, or get your head popped.""
If I did not I swear ock, he put me in headlocks
My feet dangling, just kicking his thighs
He's 6'2"", I'm 3'5, eye to eye we knee high
See I, got pain bottled up so deep
And so much stress it's like my first CD on repeat
Number nine when I rhyme and these herbs see me
Up on stage with all this rage, they like, ""Hey look at Reef.""
Then I'm okay but when I lay at the end of the day
I'm dealing with grown man issues and I'm still underage
Under paid and overworked, I feel like I'm worthless
I kept these facts under wraps and now I pull back the curtains
To my situation, reverses these verses shall serve the purpose
Of cleansing my soul until it's dirtless!
Yo

[Hook]
You don't know what it's like to be me
This is my life
And y'all swear I got it so easy
This is my life
But you don't know the half believe me
The pain in my heart exceeds me, ask my nigga Sleep E
This is my life
So much stress, ain't nothing changed dawg
This is my life
So I get high until my brain's gone
This is my life
Until the pains gone, the same song then plays on in my head
Making my days long
This is my life

[Verse Two]
I stare at these questions
My rhymes are my homework
Comparing these lessons
Preparing for my weekly therapy sessions
Aggression and anger
Combined with a weak mind, that's danger
The eyes of a painter trying to paint the eyes of a stranger
That's why it's hard for me to open my heart
When those that I let in just stepped in and broke in my heart
Not just women but those that claim to be my niggas
Pseudo fake father figure dudes, I figured you
Would try to reach me
Eventually you'll try and leave me
But why did you leave me?
The only question to you I pose
I'm okay but I'm still alive, trying to survive
In this holocaust maze, spend my days in a daze
Wanting to fly away
It's hard to stay focused
When these jokers in your face just to get paid
But yet my pockets is still flat
My knowledge is still intact but as years go by dawg I feel that
I'll never make it
Record exec's like ""You're not good enough kid, face it.""
The next stop, hip hop sanctum
My mother's basement
Remembering the good ole' days, I can't take it
The possibility I never sign a deal
It didn't matter now that I'm getting older
It's getting colder I need a shield
A career, year two
I have to be known as the greatest rapper
Since the other two or massacred
At least they were famous
I'm popular to you but everywhere else I'm nameless
I guess that's how the game is
The older I get, the younger I wish I still was
No longer deal drugs
But still get high to feel love
I'm real buzzed for a minute then it
Begins to escape me
These demons I push behind are forcing themselves to face me
Maybe I'm crazy
No I think I'm too sane for my own good
I know I zone hoods to find what makes me
Spit like this
And tick like that
And I flip like that
And if I fall I get right back
On the right track until I'm dead gone
But the only tracks are follow are the ones in my headphones
Yo

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
This 9 to 5 grind got my mind losing it's juices
Come inside and you'll find
That even though I'm popular and I know how to rhyme
Everything ain't what it seems, I just know how to lie
To my peers for years but I can no longer hide
To that man in the mirror and when I look in his eyes
I see a child who has no idea of what he's doing
Sometimes I wonder if this music will only lead to my ruin
What I'm pursing is to get rich
Doing rap songs
Old heads saying, ""You ain't that strong
You need something to fall back on.""
Here's the dilemma
Losing life or become a winner
End up a working class stiff or flip back to sinner
Either way I feel the saga will never conclude
You need to know my views before you step in my shoes
My life's become a full scale trauma of mass confusion
I have yet to scratch the surface, already I'm disillusioned
So either you part of the problem or offer a solution
Cause I people I used to love are now considered nuisances
It's been proven
You dudes got no love for me
You place me on a pedestal and pull the rug from under me
It's kind of sick these cowards will build my confidence
Only to hide their dominant prescience of their incompetence
It's not that I'm being selfish, I'm not trying to share the wealth
But please don't act like you ain't in my life for yourself
I'm a rhyme stand out
Niggas hands out
They wanna kick it
Ride my back like [?] Amtrak and I'm they ticket
Check your bags at the door along with your ego
Cause it wasn't till The High Life that I talk to you people
Now I walk with you people
All of a sudden niggas acting like cousins and brothers
Motherfucker you play a part of nothing
Waiting for the moment for my career to start jumping
So you can be right there when the cheese begins to cutting
Here's a percentage
Get the fuck away from me I'm finished
The jig is up
Give it up, just stop pretending

396,Bittersweet Me,"[Verse 1]
I move across, innocence lost
All flashing pulsar
I move across the earth in my new pattern shirt
I pass satellites
""You're so bitter,"" your complaint
I can't give you anything
I don't know who you're living for
I don't who you are anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd sooner chew my leg off
Than be trapped in this
How easy you think of all of this as bittersweet me

[Chorus]
I couldn't taste it
I'm tired and naked
I don't know what I'm hungry for
I don't know what I want anymore

[Verse 2]
I move across, candy floss
I move like a tank
I move across the room with a heart full of gloom
I'm stronger than you think
Oh, my peer, your veneer
Is wearing thin and cracking
The surface informs the underneath
The underneath is lacking

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd sooner chew my leg off
Than be trapped in this
How easy you think of all of this as bittersweet me

[Chorus]
I couldn't taste it
I'm tired and naked
I don't know what I'm hungry for
I don't know what I want anymore

[Verse 3]
You move across, innocence lost
All static and desire
You're blue in the face from navel gaze
You set yourself on fire
You strip down and lay yourself out
I know you can't fake it
But are you tired and naked?
Oh, are you tired and naked?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd sooner chew my leg off
Than be trapped in this
How easy you think of all of this as bittersweet me

[Chorus]
I couldn't taste it
I'm tired and naked
I don't know what I'm hungry for
I don't know what I want anymore
I couldn't taste it
I'm tired and naked
I don't know what I'm hungry for
I don't know what I want anymore
I couldn't taste it

There's so many angels surrounding me

To my own heartbeat

My mouth can't hide what's deep down inside my soul
And I gotta say it again, and again, and again, and again

401,Leavin',"[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah (I knew this day was coming)
Sometimes, you gotta come back down (It's all going to hell now, man)
Stoop to someone's level (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Five dozen flies buzzin' over your head
Call me the Grim Reaper, sleep is my cousin
You're dead to me now and I'ma be the last face you see
'Fore you die cussin' (Yep)
My eye a tiger's and I'm a survivor so I will rise up and (What?)
Be triumphant 'cause when I'm looking at my legacy (Leg, I see)
Bunch of dogs tryna dry hump it
Like Triumph The Puppet, so I'm like, ""Fuck it""
Pile the carnage up 'til it's so high, it's touching the sky
Let 'em all line up and attack
Single filing up in the stack
Call 'em toy soldiers (Yeah)
'Cause they just wind up on their backs
Now the sky's nothing but black
But I am not coming back, I done told ya
I told the woke me to go to sleep
But still, they keep on provoking me
They're hoping to see me completely broken emotionally
But how in the fuck am I not supposed to be woke
When these fuckers just keep poking me? Now

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm leaving Heaven
I'm leaving Heaven
Angels won't find me
Where I am going

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I've been down, kicked
Like around six thousand times since I was a kid
As a child, picked on, clowned, been
Countless times I've been outed
Gotta remind myself of it every now and then (Yeah)
So the route I went's self-empowerment
In a hole, taught myself how to get out of it
And balance it with talents, wit
'Cause life is like a penny (Life is like a penny)
'Cause it's only one percent
Who overcome the shit they've underwent
I went AWOL like what my back was up against
Don't tell me 'bout struggle, bitch, I lived it
I was five or six the first time I got my hind end kicked
Malcolm, Isaac, and Boogie jumped me and took my tricycle
And I don't know if I would call that white privilege, yeah
But I get it, how it feels to be judged by pigment
Besides getting it from both sides of the tracks
But I swore I'd get them back
Even if it meant selling my soul to get my revenge and (What?)
Thought of a scheme and it got me to thinking
If I can believe in myself, I could prolly achieve it
That’s part of the reason I do all my talking with ink
And as long as I'm breathing, I vow to smother and beat them
My god, what a heart of a demon, go at 'em and I'ma get even
Like I'm in the Garden of Eden, I'm 'bout to go off of the deep end
This evil is calling, I'm already seething and

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm leaving Heaven
I'm leaving Heaven
Angels won't find me
Where I am going

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Okay, so while Macklemore was keeping his room nice and neat (Yeah)
I was getting my ass beat twice a week (What?)
Looking for a place for the night where I could sleep (Yeah)
Flippin' sofa cushions over just tryin' to see
If I could find some change and scrape up for a bite to eat
If Denaun and me find a couple dimes a piece
Twenty five cents each'd get us a bag of chips
We'd be glad to get that even we if we had to split
We'd do backward flips, looking back at it
I think that would fit with the definition of not having shit
Couple that with the fact my mother was batshit
Pop was a sack of shit, yeah, he died, but I gave half a shit
Yeah, which brings me back to the dear 'ol dad that I zero had
Since a year-old, forty-seven year-old scab
Just to hear them words, ear piercing
Like my earlobe stabbed with a needle for an earring
Should I feel upset? You were dead to me 'fore you died
Me? Tear no shed
Should I have made a mural at your funeral?
Had your coffin draped with a hero's flag?
Where the fuck you were at
When De'Angelo done hurt me real bad at the Rio Grande?
Never met your grandkids, fucking coward
Only guts you had was from your stomach fat
I couldn't see your ass goin' to Heaven
So I'm asking for a pass to go to Hell
So I can whip your fucking ass
I hate that I'll never get to say ""I hate you"" to your face
No coming back from where I'm going
Sky is dark, my soul is black, hand on the shovel
Dig with the blade of it then I step on the metal
Vendetta to settle, tell the Devil

[Chorus: Skylar Grey & Eminem]
I'm leaving Heaven (Yeah)
I'm leaving Heaven (You know, I should dig your motherfucking ass up)
Angels won't find me (Just to spit in your fucking face)
Where I am going (Holding my baby pictures up like you're proud of me)
I'm leaving heaven (Fuck you, bitch)
I'm leaving heaven (You know what? Maybe if I had had you)
Angels won't find me (I wouldn't have went through half the shit I went through, so I blame you)
Where I am going (Or maybe I should say, ""Thank you"")
('Cause I wouldn't have been me, haha)

[Outro: Skylar Grey & Eminem]
So you better, you better run (Yeah)
You better, you better run (So I'ma let it go now, rest in peace)
You better, you better run (Cocksucker, haha)
You better, you better run (See you in Hell)",Eminem,1997,"[98, 94, 88, 88]",4

404,Tonight Is The Night,"First of all I'd like to say good evening
And we're so pleased that
So many of you could come out and share
In all the love and all the happiness we have in store for you
We want you to have a real good time
'Cause that's just what we have in mind
Is that alright with you
Now, this is a tune that I composed
And it's called
Tonight is the night
That you make me a woman
Now I never intended recording this song
It was a personal poem
This is until the day that my producer
Happened to thumb through the pages of my notebook
He came across the words and he said
'We got to somethin' with these words
It's happening every day
And people wanna hear about it, Betty'
You see, it's the story of a young girl
Making love for the very first time
Now when I finally got a melody
I took it home and I-I played it for my mother
Now I got to tell you a little bit about my mother
You see I come from one of those pretty large families
And I'm the baby of the family
And you know you never grow up to your mother
I'll never forget the way she looked at me when I played it for her
She said, 'Uh, I like the music
You know, baby, the melody it's really nice
But I know you're not gonna sing that song'
But we eased it right on by, yes, we did
And it became one of my biggest records too
So I want you to do this for me if you will
Everybody think back to your very first time
Now I'll give you a little while longer
'Cause I know some of you
Have to think back a little further than others
Come on now, I want you to play catch-up
'Cause I don't want you waitin' till I get to the end of my song
Sayin', 'Oh, yeah, now I remember'
Now whether it was good
Or you just smilin' it was good
Or on the other hand if it was not so good
Here's my story

Hmm...hmm...mmm...mmm...

Tonight is the night
That you make me a woman, mmm...
You said you'll be gentle with me
And I-I hope you will, mmm...mmm...

I'm nervous and I'm tremblin'
Waitin' for you to walk in
I'm tryin' hard to relax
But I just can't keep still, no

I can hear your car door slammin'
I wanna play big girl and put on a sexy smile
But I know so little about what love is
I just can't help actin' like a child

You're knockin' on my door and you're ringin' my bell
Hope you're not impatient after waiting so very long
A whole year I put you off with my silly hang-ups
And we're both old enough to know right from wrong

Tonight is the night
That you make me a woman, mmm...
You said you'll be gentle with me
And I-I hope you will, hmm...mmm...
I'm nervous and I'm tremblin'
Waitin' for you to walk in
Tryin' hard to relax
But I just can't keep still

Mmm...hey, baby
Ho, ho, baby
Ho...yeah...yeah...

Oh, but what if my mama should come home early
And catch us doin' what we're doin'
Not only will I never live it down
But my whole family relationship it'll all be ruined
But we've gone a little bit too far now
Oh, to turn around
So let's just pray
That true love is what we've found

Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight

Ho, I'll never forget tonight
No, no, I'll never forget tonight
That's when you make me feel real, mmm...hmm...
You make me feel real, real good
Oh...oh...whoa...oh...oh...whoa...whoa...
Yeah, and I wanna thank your love
Said I've got to thank your love
'Cause you make me feel good
And I love you, baby
I love you and I know it
And I ain't too proud to show it
'Cause I love you, baby
And I need you, baby
I want you, my love, my love
My, my, my baby
I'll never forget tonight
No, I'll never forget tonight
'Cause you make me feel good
And I love you, baby
You make me feel real good
And I love you, baby
'Cause you gave me
Uh, uh, pure love, yeah
Uh, uh, uh, pure love
Said I like that, baby
Uh, uh, pure love
Said I need that, sugar

There's nothin' phony about it

The front walk looks like runway lights
It's kind of like noon in the dead of night
Every light in the house is on
Just in case you ever do get tired of bein' gone
Every light in the house is on

[Verse 2]
If I should ever start forgettin'
I'll turn the lights off one by one
So you can see that I agree, it's over
But until then I want you to know
If you look south you'll see a glow
That's me waitin' at home each night to hold ya

[Chorus]
Every light in the house is on
The backyard's bright as the crack of dawn
The front walk looks like runway lights
It's kind of like noon in the dead of night
Every light in the house is on
Just in case you ever do get tired of bein' gone

[Chorus]
Oh, every light in the house is on
The backyard's bright as the crack of dawn
The front walk looks like runway lights
It's kind of like noon in the dead of night
Every light in the house is on
Just in case you ever do get tired of bein' gone
Every light in the house is on",Trace Adkins,1997,"[98, 92, 78]",3

Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm fallin'
In all the good times
I find myself longing for change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

410,Let's Get The Mood Right,"You look sweet as ever
Just how I picture you
Swear that you're looking better
And thats so hard to do
Girl I hope you don't mind
If I remininsce all the time
When I was your guy and you were my girl
There was nobody else in my world

Let's get the mood right
Turn on your heart light
Put on that old red dress
Baby let's cruise
Baby it's your night
Blow out the candlelight
We're going out tonight
Just me and you

Guess there ain't no denying
You just get better with time
You don't think I'm sincere
Let me make it perfectly clear
You still make me rise
With those sweet bedroom eyes
And how could I forget
How much I love the sex
And you're still the love of my life

When I think of our moments together
It just touches my heart
Don't you know it makes me wonder
How we could have fallen apart
Baby I swear from this moment on
I will be there
Keeping it going on
For the rest of my life
I'll be singing
My my my my my my

If your girl only knew
That you was trying to get with me (what would she do)
If your girl only knew
That you was dissin' her to talk to me

[Chorus]
She would probably leave you alone
She would probably curse you out and unplug her phone
I bet she'd be glad that you was gone

414,"Missing You (From ""Set It Off"")","[Verse 1: Slang Immaculate]
They all got stars in their eyes
Bars isn't tight
And their heart ain't never as hard as the hype
I'm what you like so
S-M [B] Smoke My Beef!
Dirty, let's get some pussy
I know you stash mad gash
Why don't you introduce me to three?
Nah fuck a groupie, it's time
London switched rap for dance music and grime
And they told me Brighton was hot
Brum and Bristol all up in the scene
No disrespect there's only Cambridge now see
Middle-East of the country, baby, hardest to please
Apart from Dike and Big Slang
They only really feeling Baxter and Key
And Mancunian
Don't feel no way nobody hating
Just what the fuck you're doing isn't entertaining
(Uh-huh. uh-huh)
Yeah swaggerdaddy can't jack it
Cause soon as you lean it forwards
I'ma lean it backwards on the track shit
Body motherfuckers, standard
A man ain't from where you from
You don't be rapping in my accent

[Verse 2: Stig of The Dump]
Guess who just got back from the boozer
Drinking himself into a stupor - loser!
Living pissed up without a view for the future
But still stay a step ahead just like my huge gut
You wanna know the truth bruv?
Pussy, weed and alcohol's the only things I do love
Plus I couldn't give two fucks!
Like having brewer's droop
While tryna twos up a crew slut!
It's rap's Larry David
The hatred made me take it back to the basics
My tongue twists like them K-Swiss Trainers
While these young pricks tongue-kiss their mate's anus
I ain't tryna make it famous
I do it to escape
Not for my name in the papers
Fuck the love of it
That ain't paying my wages
So if you don't know me
Don't ask me for favours
Laters!

[Verse 3: Jam Baxter]
Fuck the clichés, meet Jake the new baron
Spit a two-bar that renames your crew Sharon
You rappers move
I don't want your tunes, you have 'em
Loose cannon clashing like my garms
Rocking crew patterns
But I don't do fashion, I do talent
Do passion, do tracks
Do yats 'til their backs do spasms
Neck a few gallons of booze and lose balance
Hoof that and straight take off like your tune hasn't
There's a huge pack of crews rapping average
Who couldn't get their shit out with a huge pack of laxatives!
So you stand and grapple with your bodily deposits
My crew's back banging like the brothel in my closet
So please keep your mouth in the bottom of your pockets
When the CP's about, never bother with the gossip much
Hockin' up phlegm, set it off with the Dr. Skuff
Dike, Beats, Slang and Mr Constant, Drop it bruv!

[Verse 4: Skuff]
You are now in tune to Dikestar Delegates
And Contact Play while Mr. Constant selects the breaks
Rowdy like a mental case
On a lack of medication
That's except I don't fit like the threads I take
Anyway Contact Play spitting with delegates
Kick like that Ong-Bak brey
Missing his elephant
No one's a bad influence
I'm Mr. Mellowness
No girls that won't speak to me
Cause I'm a friend of his
We're just your everyday, common or garden hedonist
Some settled with kids, others are sexual terrorists
Or friends with benefits, depends on your opinion
If rap is your religion, I'm that heretic to wreck your kingdom
What d'you expect from this and that producer
I can tell it from the credits
I better ready the heavy future
You're now in tune to the old next level shit
Spit more, better and with much less respect, bitch!

[Verse 5: Dirty Dike]
My name's me and I'm the geezer from the ground floor
Sorta sound down, snort I'm not about war
I'm not allowed poor my dick takes the fucking piss
But I'd cut my wrists before I'd give up and love a bitch
I got drugs to sniff, big stuff to bloody shift
Big dubs to paint with my shitcunts and fucking pricks
Spliff bunnin in my room, trapped in
Planning tunes like I'm listening to New Jack Swing
I've heard the truth that's grim
It's dim lit and dark avenues
A shitstack of patterns with a binbag of have-to-dos
Think that I'm acting loose
It's pissflap the quackpig
I've been sick since Pissman the Captain
And still average wanking
I live by the slog
I'm a find a fuck pig
And have her dick behind the trunk[?]
""Agh Mr Dike's a cunt""
Stand up if you didn't like his stuff
Mouth shut and pull your fingers out your cunt

[Verse 6: Edward Scissortongue]
Call me the comatose cosmonaut
Cop a part cosmic
Break codes with a single thought
The Ice Age Ironman slowly thaws
With his ogre jaws standing so deep on the ocean floor
Rate my face twitch and the way my brain ticks
Limp-legged hunchback, billin fifty-eight spliffs
Until my face splits I spit bars that mean business
Like the shades of an agent in the matrix
May stick the same disc on every playlist
Where you play shit cause every track's amazing
And when someone's like (""Who the fuck is this?"")
It's a guaranteed fact that Mr. Scissortongue is playing
I'm moonwalking down your pavements
Rockin Hammer's crime fighting shoes
And looking like a vagrant!
Dancing with cavemen
Still seem to rinse some proper soulful rhythm and blues
Like the California Raisins

[Verse 7: Fliptrix]
It's the herb-thirsty writer
Cursing on Dirty's side and
Puffing on some durban that's certain to murkalise ya
Immersed in the earth slurp turf throwin fireballs
The way we're living is like we're not even hire-able
So being criminal is certainly more desirable
You want clean cut
Then a set of surgical knives will do
I'm getting higher than burglars
On the pergola
Getting into your world
And then sitting there disturbing you
Until you start to switch
Cause you thinking of turning murderous
It's too late for you
Some vultures done circled you
I still fly, chilling with that turbulence
I live life, a million and one purposes
The main two I service
A verballist-stroke-herballist
I kill you inadvertently
Triggering some emergency
They always think a pattern
I'm not a Doctor, why nurse that shit

[Verse 8: Leaf Dog]
With no ability they tried to see me
Blindfolded, walking the plank that leads to the sea
When I need herbs, like the third world needs rice
You need words, like a mask in a bank heist
Fuck a mic!
You can barely hold a conversation!
My rhymes have got the power to move you like immigration
Never mistaken, I was born in the wastebin
Mesmerised by the fucking snare that I'm chasing
Just waiting
For my album to be released
And my dick's up in your mouth
Like a swab from the police
[?] is a beast
He'll degrade you like a strip search
On some next shit like when you found out that your dick works
Your chance to spit first
My stance is stood perched
You're brain-dead like your real name was lurch
You switch up, used to love boom-bap
But like a junkie hit dick cause you scared of the old track

[Verse 9: BVA]
I've got thoughts running round my head like they're speeding
Fuck herbs, things could be much worse seeming
I'll never stop dreaming, time to stay believing
And naturally turn shit dark like an evening
I levitate, close my eyes like I meditate
Generate a heavy stone
Roam hitting better tapes
Here to take the something with real hip hop
To let everyone know it's time
Like really big clocks
Tick but don't tock
Lose the plot like a needle
The one's that you see looking fucked up
They're my people!
And keep what I speak true
Because the deep will
Make you want to get up
Go out and seek sequels
If I said I was a rapper
Would you preconceive
But I'd bet you'd get it totally different to what is me
If you want name dropping
I'm BVA MC
Blow chunks of wisdom when I talk sickly",Dirty Dike,1997,[50],1
415,Jellyhead,"So what if your jeans are torn
They've been torn since Bros were cool
I wanted you for a little while
You got it wrong by a million miles
Big deal, what a thrill, what a let down
Kissing in your car
When I should have been out
I want the Prodigy really loud
I want it all right now

(Chorus:)
Over and over I feel it
Boyfriend you're alone
You must be out of your mind
Jellyhead, you've really blown it
Over and over I feel it
Boyfriend you're alone
You must be out of your mind
Jellyhead, you've really blown it

In the slow lane
Never change the way that I feel
Go home, never know, never be real
'Cause not one thing you said was true
I'm gonna find somebody new
Make up, break up, always the same
Get out, what about you and me say
I've been hanging around you too long
When summer comes I'm gone

I wanna be flying in the clear sky
I wanna be diving in the blue
I gotta be out in the evening

Without you

It's beginning to look a lot like, what?
Follow my every step
Take notes on how I crept
I's bout to go in depth
This is the way I creep my season, here's my ghetto rep
I kept, to say the least no, no it can't cease
So I begin to piece my two and two together
Gots no snowy weather, have to find something to do better, bet
I said subtract, so shut up that, nonsense about some silent night
I gots it crunk, if it ain't real, ain't right
I'm like no matter what the season
Forever chill with Smith
I sip my fifth, I chill with Wesson, got my reasons
So tell me what did you expect
You thought I'd break my neck, to help y'all deck the halls
Oh naw, I got other means of celebrating
I'm getting blizzard at HoJo, I got that hoochie waiting
I made it through another year can't ask for nothing much more
It's OutKast for the books I thought you knew so now you know, let's go

Halle-lu-jah, halle-lu-jah
Y'know I do some things more different than I used to
'Cause I'm a player, doing what the players do
The package store was closed, okay my day is ruined
This is ridiculous, I'm getting serious, I'm getting curious
'Cause the house is smelling stank, the chitlins old as bitches
I made no wishes cause I'm mobbing folk niggas in the back
Getting tipsy off the nog and high as hell off the contact smoke
They having a smoke out in my back seat
They passing herb rewinding verses 'cause it's in the air
I hit the parks, I hit the cuts, I'm hitting switches
'Cause I'm switching from side to side looking for hoes and snitches
I'm wide open on the freeway, my pager broke my vibe
'Cause a junkie is a junkie three-sixty-five
It's just another day of work to me the spirit just ain't in me
Grab my pistol and my ounce see what them junkies gotta give me

Ain't no chimneys in the ghetto so I won't be hanging my socks on no chimney
I'm fit as a tick, fix me a plate, I got the remedy
Some greens and that ham, not
Don't need no ham hocks, don't play me like I'm smoking rocks
I got the munchies, we got the Mary Jane in the Dungeon

So ho ho hoes, check my king-ass 'fro
The gin and juice has got me tipsy so, um

It goes, give me ten, and I'll serve you then, now we bend
The corner in my Cadillac
My heart does not go pitty-pat for no rat

Coke, rum and indo fills my body, where's the party?
