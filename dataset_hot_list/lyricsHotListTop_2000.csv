Lucy Liu
With my girl, Drew
Cameron D. and Destiny
Charlie's Angels, come on
Uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1]
Question, tell me what you think about me
I buy my own diamonds and I buy my own rings
Only ring your celly when I'm feelin lonely
When it's all over, please get up and leave
Question, tell me how you feel about this
Try to control me, boy, you get dismissed
Pay my own fun, oh, and I pay my own bills
Always 50-50 in relationships

[Pre-Chorus: Kelly and Farrah]
The shoes on my feet, I bought it
The clothes I'm wearing, I bought it
The rock I'm rocking, I bought it
'Cause I depend on me if I want it
The watch I'm wearing, I bought it
The house I live in, I bought it
The car I'm driving, I've bought it
I depend on me (I depend on me)

[Chorus]
All the women, who are independent
Throw your hands up at me
All the honeys, who making money
Throw your hands up at me
All the mommas, who profit dollars
Throw your hands up at me
All the ladies, who truly feel me
Throw your hands up at me

[Bridge]
Girl I didn't know you could get down like that
Charlie, how your Angels get down like that
Girl I didn't know you could get down like that
Charlie, how your Angels get down like that

[Verse 2]
Tell me how you feel about this
Do what I want, live how I wanna live
I worked hard and sacrificed to get what I get
Ladies, it ain't easy being independent
Question, how'd you like this knowledge that I brought?
Bragging on that cash that he gave you is to front
If you're gonna brag, make sure it's your money you flaunt
Depend on no one else to give you what you want

[Pre-Chorus: Kelly and Farrah]
The shoes on my feet, I bought it
The clothes I'm wearing, I bought it
The rock I'm rocking, I bought it

Destiny's Child, wassup?
You in the house? Sure 'nuff
We'll break these people off, Angel style
Child of Destiny, independent beauty
No one else can scare me
Charlie's Angels, woah

[Chorus]
All the women, who are independent
Throw your hands up at me
All the honeys, who making money
Throw your hands up at me
All the mommas, who profit dollars
Throw your hands up at me
All the ladies, who truly feel me
Throw your hands up at me

2,It Wasn't Me,"[Intro (spoken): Rikrok & Shaggy]
Yo, man
Yo
Open up, man
Yeah, what do you want, man?
My girl just caught me
You let her catch you?
I don't know how all of this happened
With who?
The girl next door, ya know?
Man, I don't know what to do
Say it wasn't you
Alright...

[Chorus: Rikrok]
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me

[Verse 1: Shaggy]
How ya fi give ya woman access to your villa?
Trespass and a witness all the hackling on the pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killer
Best review the situation that you caught up inna
To be a true player you've to know how to play
If she say, “a night”, convince her, say, “a day”
Never admit to a word what she say
And if she claim a yuh, tell her, “Baby, no way!”

[Pre-Chorus: Rikrok & (Shaggy)]
But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (Wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (Wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder (Wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (Wasn’t me)
Heard the screams getting louder (Wasn’t me)
She stayed until it was over

[Chorus: Rikrok]
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
I had tried to keep her from what
She was about to see
Why should she believe me
When I told her it wasn't me?

[Verse 2: Shaggy]
Makes you know say that she really no right for vex
A never you she see yah make the gigolo flex
A smaddy else a favor you inna di complex
Seein' is believin', so you better change your specs
You know she a go bring a whole heap a things up from the past
All the little evident, you betta know fe mask
Quick 'pon yuh hansa, know how fe talk
But if she pack a gun, you know, you betta run fast

[Pre-Chorus: Rikrok & (Shaggy)]
But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)
Saw me banging on the sofa (Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (Wasn't me)

How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me

[Bridge: Rikrok]
Wanna tell her that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
I've been listenin' to your reason
It makes no sense at all
People tell her that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
You may think that you're a player
But you're completely lost
That's why I sing

[Chorus: Rikrok]
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
My baby's drama mama don't like me
She be doin' things like havin' them boys
Come from her neighborhood to the studio, tryna fight me
She needs to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills—I pay that
I love your mom and everything
But see, I ain't the only one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war
My lawyers stay down
She never got a chance to hear my side of the story
We was divided
She had fish fries, cookouts for my child's birthday, I ain't invited Despite it I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

Ms. Jackson

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin', find
The quickest muzzle, throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing
Together dream 'bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever ever? Forever, ever??
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me had
I pray so much about it, need some knee pads
It happened for a reason, one can't be mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes I will be present on the first day of school and graduation

I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real

Done got your ass sent up the creek, G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle and ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl ain't speakin' no more
‘Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talkin' about?
Jealousy, infidelity, envy, cheating, beating
In the year 2G, they be the same thing
So who you placin' the blame on?
You keep on singin' the same song; let bygones be bygones
And you can go on and get the hell on, you and your mama

[Intro: Joe Budden]
Turn me up in the headphone something
(New Joe Budden)
Look

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
First off let me shout out the fam, y'all so gracious
Been chilling in the room for growth, it's so spacious
Getting to the money, counting these old faces
Like I found the smoking gun in cold cases (nah)
Them dark thoughts never got to 'em still
I'm like the legendary Robin Will
Even though I understand
I never dealt with the pain like that
A knot from that same rope
But I don't hang like that
We had a couple break-ups
Gotta respect Cuzz and I'll hit the reset button
You try to reset Budden, it's real
My accomplishments
Already show 'em how I deal with the consequence
And you can ask Consequence
She reached out via text like ""What up with the guy?""
Which is weird, it's been a year
Since we fraternized
Still I made my way back in her life
Only to prove to myself I wouldn't fuck up twice
We reminiscing, thinking hella back
You had to watch me with her but to hell with that
Cause I think that me carrying that thought
Kind of washed me with her
And even that's cool cause me and you is not me and her
I took a little hiatus, hope you could see the change
I was too high to say this, how could I explain?
Though my mouth was quiet
My mind was like a Ferguson riot
Why it only get worse when I'm in private
Were we victims to the game
Trying to do it over
Here's the gift for an exchange
It's timeout for the public
These niggas won't know a thing
So we keep each other blocked on Twitter
It's not a game
Like a picture in a frame for now
Drunk models, couple Swishers and a stack here

[Hook: Felicia Temple]
Everytime I walk away, you need me
But your words don't mean a thing when you're not here
Tell me is this the way
The way that you love me
Tell me is this the way
The way that you care

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
She said she wanna set boundaries
Can't continue to have you surrounding me
Cause that'll lead to you on this couch pounding me
That'll bring them feelings back
That's just out of bounds to me
It's been years, last bitch ain't come around to me
Send my tone of voice down
Like you speaking down to me
Said I said some things to begrudge you
But I can't ask to not be judged then judge you
She said; all this time I've been screaming ""Fuck You""
When she implies I can't move on I'm stuck too
Blood flowing, there's an adrenaline rush too
Every time I'm tryna leave
It's when you're in a rush too
She said; looking back I can see how you was gaming me
Which is fine, I can see how you could feel there
Which means I just gotta ask you one question though
If it was game tell me why them feelings still there?
I know the answer to that: you still fallin'
You ain't never felt so strong, it feels foreign
Probably got me saved in her phone as Phil Collins
Hear it in the air of the night it's still callin'
Every time you see me a couple of bills on him
Got rich then did it again we still ballin'
You ain't gotta respond to that
If you did it would look like it's a con to that
I'm so far beyond of that
Chillin' with a couple of hoes that like hoes
That like niggas that don't act like hoes
I don't say that cause I'm vain
Or some strangers can know I'm the man
We not fucking
Sometimes it's better knowing you can't
She come running back
Every time she throw in the can
Just to holla when she feel like not a soul understand
Baby, I already proved that I ride out
You can't bear to be hurt again so you hide out
You ain't gotta say that, I know you inside out
We communicate so well when all the pride's out
You gotta give it one more go, we ain't tried out
Nah that love wouldn't a been real if it died out

You think I'm weak, I think you're wrong

I think you're already leavin'
Feels like your hand is on the door
I thought this place was an empire
Now I'm relaxed, I can't be sure

[Pre-Chorus]
And I think you're so mean, I think we should try
I think I could need, this in my life and
I think I'm scared, I think too much
I know it's wrong, it's a problem I'm dealin'

If you're gone
Maybe it's time to come home
There's an awful lot of breathing room
But I can hardly move
If you're gone
Baby you need to come home (Oh, come home)
There's a little bit of something me
In everything in you

I bet you're hard to get over
I bet the room just won't shine
I bet my hands I can stay here
And I bet you need more than you mind

[Pre-Chorus]
And I think you're so mean, I think we should try
I think I could need, this in my life
I think I'm just scared, that I know too much
I know it's wrong, it's a problem I'm dealin'

[Chorus]
If you're gone
Maybe it's time to come home
There's an awful lot of breathing room
But I can hardly move
If you're gone
Baby, you need to come home (Aw, come home)
There's a little bit of something me
In everything in you

[Pre-Chorus]
I think you're so mean, I think we should try
I think I could need this in my life and
I think I'm scared, do I talk too much?
I know it's wrong, it's a problem I'm dealin'

[Chorus]
If you're gone
Then maybe it's time to come home
Well, there's an awful lot of breathing room
But I can hardly move
Yeah, well if you're gone

Well, I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind
I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time
But I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
I feel there's nothing I can do, yeah

I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
After all I knew, it had to be something to do with you
I really don't mind what happens now and then
As long as you'll be my friend at the end

If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there and holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might

You called me strong, you called me weak
But still your secrets, I will keep

I tell you exactly what you need if you just listen
I'm just rollin' up, I split the weed just like division
I don't really know this bitch I met her through my mentions
Heard I fucked her cousin good and paid her no attention
Not to mention I'm on Insta, diamonds trippin' I'm just chillin'

Hey, this is radio station WSKEE
We're taking calls on the wish line
Making your wacky wishes come true
Hello?

[Hook]
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala

[Verse 1]
I wish I was like six-foot-nine so I can get with Leoshi
'Cause she don't know me but, yo, she's really fine
You know I see her all the time, everywhere I go
And even in my dreams, I can scheme of ways to make her mine
'Cause I know she's livin' phat
Her boyfriend's tall and he plays ball, so how am I gonna compete with that?
'Cause when it comes to playing basketball
I'm always last to be picked and in some cases never picked at all
So I just lean up on the wall
Or sit up in the bleachers with the rest of the girls who came to watch their man ball
Dag y'all! I never understood, black
Why the jocks get the fly girls, and me, I get the hood rats
I tell 'em, ""Scat, skittle, scabobble""
Got hit with a bottle and put in a hospital for talkin' that mess
I confess, it's a shame
When you livin' in a city that's the size of a box and nobody knows yo' name
Glad I came, to my senses
Like quick-quick, got sick-sick to my stomach, overcometh by thoughts
Of me and her together, right?
So when I asked her out, she said I wasn't her type

I wish I had a brand new car so far, I got this hatchback
And everywhere I go, yo, I gets laughed at
And when I'm in my car I'm laid back
I got an 8-track, and a spare tire in the backseat, but that's flat
And do you really wanna know what's really wack?
See, I can't even get a date, so what do you think of that?
I heard that prom night is a bomb night
With a hood rat t'you can hold tight
But really though, I'm Figaro
When in my car, I can't even get a hello
Well, so many people wanna cruise Crenshaw on Sunday
One day I'mma have to get in my car and go
You know I take the 110 until the 105
Get off at Crenshaw, tell my homies, ""Look alive""
'Cause it's hard to survive
When you're living in a concrete jungle and these girls keep passing me by
She looks fly, she looks fly
Make me say, ""my, my, my""

Hey, I wish I had my way
'Cause every day would be a Friday, and you could even speed on the highway
I would play ghetto games
Name my kids ghetto names: Little Mookie, Big Al, Lorraine
Yo, you know that's on the real
So if you're down on your luck then you should know just how I feel
'Cause if you don't want me around
See, I go simple, I go easy, I go Greyhound

Everybody look what's going down
Ah, yes, ain't that fresh?
Everybody wants to get down like that

18,Shape Of My Heart,"[Verse 1]
He deals the cards as a meditation
And those he plays never suspect
He doesn't play for the money he wins
He doesn't play for respect
He deals the cards to find the answer
The sacred geometry of chance
The hidden law of a probable outcome
The numbers lead a dance

[Chorus]
I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs are weapons of war
I know that diamonds mean money for this art
But that's not the shape of my heart

[Verse 2]
He may play the jack of diamonds
He may lay the queen of spades
He may conceal a king in his hand
While a memory of it fades

[Chorus]
I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs are weapons of war
I know that diamonds mean money for this art
But that's not the shape of my heart

[Bridge]
That's not the shape, the shape of my heart

[​​Harmonica Solo]​​

[Verse 3]
And if I told you that I loved you
You'd maybe think there's something wrong
I'm not a man of too many faces
The mask I wear is one
But those who speak know nothing
And find out to their cost
Like those who curse their luck in too many places
And those who fear are lost

[Chorus]
I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs are weapons of war
I know that diamonds mean money for this art
But that's not the shape of my heart

Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't

My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

[Verse 1]
When you rolled up in the Escalade
Saw that truck you gave to the valet
Knew that it was game when you looked at me
Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Rollie bling

Raising up a toast, so I would notice you
But your heart's a mess, think you oughta know
Doesn't matter if you're balling out of control

That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy, yeah

Love don't cost a thing, a thing, a thing
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You think the money that you make (That you make)
Can substitute the time you take (The time you take)
Take the keys here to my heart
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart (Don't cost a thing)
I think you need to take some time
To show me that your love is true (Ooh)
There's more than dollar signs in you
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart

[Chorus]
Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't

21,Pinch Me,"[Verse 1]
It's the perfect time of year
Somewhere far away from here
I feel fine enough, I guess
Considering everything's a mess
There's a restaurant down the street
Where hungry people like to eat
I could walk, but I'll just drive
It's colder than it looks outside

[Chorus]
It's like a dream you try to remember but it's gone when ya
Try to scream but it only comes out as a yawn when ya
Try to see the world beyond your front door
Take your time because the way I rhyme's gonna make you smile when ya
Realize that with a guy my size it might take a while just to
Try to figure out what all this is for

[Verse 2]
It's the perfect time of day
To throw all your cares away
Put the sprinkler on the lawn
And run through with my gym shorts on
Take a drink right from the hose
And change into some drier clothes
Climb the stairs up to my room
Sleep away the afternoon

[Chorus]
It's like a dream you try to remember but it's gone when ya
Try to scream but it only comes out as a yawn when ya
Try to see the world beyond your front door

Realize that with a guy my size it might take a while just to
Try to figure out what all this is for

Tell me
That I'm still asleep

On an evening such as this
It's hard to tell if I exist
If I packed a car and leave this town
Who'll notice that I'm not around?
I could hide out under there
I just made you say 'underwear'
I could leave but I'll just stay
All my stuff's here anyway

I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, ""Ahh ahh,"" you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?

I wanna get you in the Georgia Dome on the 50-yard line
While the Dirty Birds kick for t'ree
And if you like in the club, we can do it
In the DJ booth or in the back of the V.I.P
Whipped cream with cherries and strawberries on top, lick it don't stop
Keep the door locked, don't knock while the boat rock
We go-bots and robots, so they got to wait til the show stop
Or how about on the beach with black sand?
Lick up your thigh then call me the Pac Man
Table top or just give me a lap dance
The Rock to the Park to the Point to the Flatlands
That man Ludacris (woo!) in the public bathroom
Or in back of the classroom
How ever you want it, lover-lover gonna tap that ass soon
See I cast 'em and I passed 'em
Get a tight grip and I grasp 'em
I flash 'em and outlast 'em
And if ain't good then I trash 'em
While you stash 'em, I'll let 'em free
And they tell me what they fantasy
Like up on the roof, roof
Tell your boyfriend not to be mad at me!

I wanna get you in the bath tub
With the candles lit; you give it up 'til they go out
Or we can do it on stage at the Ludacris concert
'Cause you know it got sold out!
A red carpet dick it just roll out
Go ahead and scream, you can't hold out
We can do it in the pouring rain
Running the train, when it's hot or when it's cold out
How about in the library on top of books?
But you can't be too loud!
You wanna make a brother beg for it
Give me TLC 'cause you know I be too proud
We can do it in the White House
Try to make them turn the lights out
Champagne with my campaign
Let me do the damn thing
What's my name, what's my name, what's my name?
A sauna, jacuzzi, in the back row at the movie
You can scratch my back and rule me
You can push me and just pull me
On hay in middle of the barn
Rose petals on the silk sheets
Eating fresh fruits, sweep your woman right off her feet

I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
I wanna get you in the back seat, windows up
That's the way you like to fuck
Clogged up, fog alert
Rip the pants and rip the shirt
Rough sex: make it hurt
In the garden all in the dirt
Roll around Georgia Brown: that's the way I like it, twerk
Legs jerk, overworked
Underpaid, but don't be afraid
In the sun or up in the shade
On the top of my Escalade
Maybe your girl and my friend can trade
Tag team, off the ropes!
On the ocean or in the boat!
Factories or one hundred spokes!
What about up in the candy store?
That chocolate, chocolate make it melt
Whips and chains, handcuffs
Smack a little booty up with my belt
Scream ""help!"" Play my game!
Dracula, man, I'll get my fangs
Horseback and I'll get my reins
School teacher, let me get my brains

The heart is a bloom, shoots up through the stoney ground
There's no room, no space to rent in this town
You're out of luck, and the reason that you had to care
The traffic is stuck, and you're not moving anywhere
You thought you'd found a friend to take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand in return for grace

It's a beautiful day
Sky falls, you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

You're on the road, but you've got no destination
You're in the mud, in the maze of her imagination
You love this town even if that doesn't ring true

Don't let it get away

See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light
And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colours came out

[Intro: Jimmy Smith]
Good God Almighty—like back in the old days...
You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it. We had the champagne in the studio, of course—compliments of the company—and we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball. Only real music is gonna last—all the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow...

[Chorus: Timbaland]

Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents
But thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn

Look at my neck, I got a karat cake, uh
Now here's the icin' on the cake
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, uhh

I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions, Biggs made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans'a tell you if he wasn't in his feelings
Uh, I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's tryna chase this cash
Gucci airbag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil, Jesus grab the wheel

[Verse 4: Drake]
Yeah, uh
Look, fuck all that ""Happy to be here"" shit that y'all want me on
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil bro me, dog
Like I should fall in line, like I should alert niggas
When I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy
And not say I'm the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here
So I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts
That I would share with myself
But I thought ""Fuck it"", it's worth it to share 'em
With someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think she's straight
'Cause she supported since Hot Beats
Right before Wayne came and got me
Out of the back room where I was rapping with Jas
Over beats that I shouldn't have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me always
Couldn't believe when he called me
You never know, it could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit 'cause it's somethin' to do
Yeah, I guess that's just who I became, dawg

27,My Next Thirty Years,"[Verse 1]
I think I’ll take a moment, celebrate my age
The ending of an era and the turning of a page
Now it’s time to focus in on where I go from here
Lord have mercy on my next thirty years

[Verse 2]
Hey my next thirty years I’m going to have some fun
Try to forget about all the crazy things I’ve done
Maybe now I’ve conquered all my adolescent fears
And I’ll do it better in my next thirty years

[Verse 3]
My next thirty years I’m going to settle all the scores
Cry a little less, laugh a little more
Find a world of happiness without the hate and fear
Figure out just what I’m doing here
In my next thirty years

[Verse 4]
Oh my next thirty years, I’m going to watch my weight
Eat a few more salads and not stay up so late
Drink a little lemonade and not so many beers
Maybe I’ll remember my next thirty years

[Verse 5]
My next thirty years will be the best years of my life
Raise a little family and hang out with my wife
Spend precious moments with the ones that I hold dear
Make up for lost time here, in my next thirty years

[Verse 1]
I know your tears more than you cause I see them so much
That's what happens when you're here with no trust
Okay, I lied, cheated, you cried
You done worse shit and I'm still here right
And motherfuck your friends, all them hoes hating
If you're not down then what's your location
I called and checked in every night and that was not probation
They gave they two cents and we ain't ask for no donation
Man you on some other other shit
Just found out about my other other bitch
Went from I love you to you don't know who you fucking with
Fresh off a vaca' and already need another trip
She said I had enough tries
Oh, and I'm the reason that she doesn't trust guys
What's the perfect girl if it's not the perfect time
If you wanna leave fine

[Hook]
Just don't tell me you love me
You're gonna make it too hard for me
I wish you were ugly
It wouldn't be so hard to leave
Cause baby I hate to love you
I can't make up my mind
Cause right when I tell you it's over
By the end of the night I be right back in bed with you
I be right back in bed with you
So don't tell me you love me

[Verse 2]
Wishing I would've tried more, she wanted the truth
Truthfully I wish I lied more cause when I was true
All I heard was ""bye"" more, ""fuck you""
""Who is that"" and ""I don't know why"" more (Shut da fuck up)
We were picture perfect and I tore it all apart
But if I pick up all the pieces we could still be a collage
Feeling like we ended too soon
Used to stay home and do it in all the rooms
Back shots, I know what you like
Had you hitting high notes and you ain't even need no autotune
Nights I was Patron'd up
Girls dressed alike looking like they cloned up
Same nights I wouldn't pick my phone up
And you was thinking damn boy grow up
And I could still hear her leaving
Crazy when a heart breaks it never breaks even
I even found another girl that's perfect
And I'm the only reason we're not working
Cause what's the perfect girl if it's not the perfect time
And if you wanna stay fine

[Hook]
Just don't tell me you love me
You're gonna make it too hard for me
I wish you were ugly
It wouldn't be so hard to leave
Cause baby I hate to love you
I can't make up my mind
Cause right when I tell you it's over
By the end of the night I be right back in bed with you
I be right back in bed with you
So don't tell me you love me

Cause the way you walked away, I thought I wasn't gon see you no more
Since you didn't wanna give me your math
I thought that you were iggin' me, and wasn't diggin' me
But anyway, what you doing tonight?

I remember when
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions had an echo, in so much space
And when you're out there without care
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much

[Chorus 1]
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly

[Verse 2]
And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice, that's my only advice
Come on now, who do you
Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?
Ha, ha, ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control?

[Chorus 2]
Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me

[Verse 3]
My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on the limb
And all I remember is thinkin' I wanna be like them
Ever since I was little
Ever since I was little, it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done

Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy

41,We Danced,"[Verse 1]
The bar was empty
I was sweeping up the floor
That's when she walked in
I said, ""I'm sorry but we're closed""
And she said ""I know
But I'm afraid I left my purse""
I said, ""I put one back behind the bar
I bet it's probably yours""
And the next thing that I knew
There we were, lost in conversation
And before I handed her her purse
I said, ""You'll only get this back on one condition""

[Chorus]
And we danced
Out there on that empty hardwood floor
The chairs up and the lights turned way down low
The music played, we held each other close
And we danced

[Verse 2]
And from that moment
There was never any doubt
I had found the one
That I had always dreamed about
And then one evening
When she stopped by after work
I pulled a diamond ring out of the pocket of my shirt
And as her eyes filled up with tears
She said, ""This is the last thing I expected""
And then she took me by the hand
And said, ""I'll only marry you on one condition""

[Chorus]

Like no one else had ever danced before
I can't explain what happened on that floor

Pain is just a consequence of love
I'm saying sorry for the sake of us

He wasn't my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say

You are my everything
You are, you are
You are my everything

I know you're not far, but I still can't handle all the distance
You're travelling with my heart
I hope this is a temporary feeling
'Cause it's too much to bear without you
And I know ""sorry"" ain't the cure
If I cross your mind, just know I'm yours
'Cause what we got is worth fighting for
'Cause you are

I shoulda seen it comin boy I wish I would-a
But you fucked up when you left your phone unlocked
Cause I had to see whats up
When that number called in blocked

Cause you didn't tell me you had a girlfriend
Where was she when you were lyin in my bed?
How could I be so dumb, thinkin I'm the only one
Next time I'll make sure not to be foolish

So make sure you tell her all about me
Tell her how you said that you loved me
Tell her all you told to me, how this is where you wanna be
And you can't see yourself living without me
Tell her how you said you was on my team and how you said
I was the one that you need
You'll never find another me, Now what we have is memories
I hope that you remember when you tell her about me

(Tell her about me)

I gave you everything you wanted and you loved it
But when it came down to loving me
You saw something in me worth taking but nothing worth keeping
Ohhhh oh
I shoulda saw the signs but I chose not to
I chose to see everything good about you
But you been actin distant lately
You been actin different baby
Won't pick up the phone when I'm around you

So make sure you tell her all about me
Tell her how you said that you loved me
Tell her all you told to me, how this is where you wanna be
And you can't see yourself living without me
Tell her how you said you was on my team and how you said
I was the one that you need
You'll never find another me, Now what we have is memories
I hope that you remember when you tell her about me

(Tell her about me)

I was never worth it to you
I thought I was perfect for you

So make sure you tell her all about me
Tell her how you said that you loved me
Tell her all you told to me, how this is where you wanna be
And you can't see yourself living without me
Tell her how you said you was on my team and how you said

50,Just Another Day In Paradise,"The big cold city was such a lonely place to be
Hustle all day and dream of the islands and sea
Millions of girls but none of them seemed right for me
'Till you came along and you touched me and set me free

So we slipped away last night eased on down to the Keys
Flying so high we hitched a ride on a Gulf Stream breeze
Living on love and the fruits from tropical trees
With a song in our hearts and our eyes on the West Indies

It's just another day in paradise
Loving the night away till the sunrise
Seeing that ""I love you"" look in your eyes
It's just another day in paradise

A bottle rum listen to the steel drum band
Laughing in the moonlight along the beach we ran
Splashing naked in the sea making love upon the sand
Falling fast asleep like children hand in hand

It's just another day in paradise
Loving the night away till the sunrise
Seeing that ""I love you"" look in your eyes
It's just another day in paradise

I woke up this morning with the sunlight in my eyes
Guess it was only a dream I hear the city outside
But I look at you sleeping and honey now I realize
That anywhere with you is paradise

'Cause I might change my mind

Would never ever get too close
Didn't ever wanna lose control

I knew that I would have to chase it

You made me believe that love was forever
And love could sustain us through every fight
I let go of all of the other pretenders
They were wasting my time

I never thought that I would say this
But I can see us having babies
I could see it from the start
That I might give you my heart
From the moment that I met you
Knew that I would never let you
Slip away, it's okay
You can make me

The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all

Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan

[Verse 2: Eminem (as Stan)]
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blisterin' cold
For you, for four hours, and you just said no
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver?
You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
‘Cause I don't really got shit else
So that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you ‘cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose

This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months, and still no word—I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' 90 on the freeway
Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin'
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now—I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together—think about it!
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim—shut up, bitch! I'm tryin' to talk
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up—See? I ain't like you
‘Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh, shit, I forgot—how am I supposed to send this shit out?!

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph
For your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
To help your ass from bouncin'
Off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand
That I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk
And she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to

“Be careful with that one, love

You and your words flooded my senses
Your sentences left me defenseless

You built cathedrals

I’m searching and scanning for answers
In every line
For some kind of sign

When she read what you’d done?
She said
“You have married an Icarus
He has flown too close to the sun.”

You and your words, obsessed with your legacy...
Your sentences border on senseless
And you are paranoid in every paragraph
How they perceive you

61,The Little Girl,"[Verse 1: John Michael Montgomery]
Her parents never took the young girl to church
Never spoke of His Name, never read her His Word
Two non-believers walkin' lost in this world
Took their baby with them, what a sad little girl

[Verse 2: John Michael Montgomery]
Her Daddy drank all day and Mommy did drugs
Never wanted to play, or give kisses and hugs
She'd watch the TV, and sit there on the couch
While her Mom fell asleep, and her Daddy went out

[Chorus 1: John Michael Montgomery, Alison Krauss & Dan Tyminski]
And the drinking and the fighting just got worse every night
Behind their couch she'd be hiding, oh what a sad little life

[Verse 3: John Michael Montgomery]
And like it always does, the bad just got worse
With every slap and every curse
Until her Daddy, in a drunk rage one night
Used a gun on her Mom, and then took his life

[Chorus 2: John Michael Montgomery, Alison Krauss & Dan Tyminski]
And some people from the city took the girl far away
To a new Mom and a new Dad, kisses and hugs everyday

[Verse 4: John Michael Montgomery]
Her first day of Sunday school, the teacher walked in
And a small little girl stared at a picture of Him
She said, I know that man up there on that cross
I don't know His name, but I know He got off

Them heartless hours, my apartment is lost in a coffin

Then I fall when summer is ending
I mean, there's no pretending
I'm stuck in my ways and you're offended, that's life
That's you, this me, that vice
You're wrong, I'm right, that's right
I belong somewhere on ice
I'm cold, and my new blood type?
Even colder, cold shoulder

I have nothing to lose

A Gemini gon' show them faces
And this here just one of my moods, Babylon

67,The Christmas Shoes,"[Verse 1]
It was almost Christmas time
And there I stood in another line
Trying to buy that last gift or two
Not really in the Christmas mood
Standing right in front of me
Was a little boy waiting anxiously
Pacing 'round like little boys do
And in his hands he held a pair of shoes
And his clothes were worn and old
He was dirty from head to toe
And when it came his time to pay
I couldn't believe what I heard him say

[Chorus]
Sir, I want to buy these shoes for my Mama, please
It's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size
Could you hurry, sir, Daddy says there's not much time
You see, she's been sick for quite awhile
And I know these shoes would make her smile
And I want her to look beautiful if Mama meets Jesus tonight

[Verse 2]
He counted pennies for what seemed like years
Then the Cashier said, ""Son, there's not enough here""
He searched his pockets frantically
Then he turned and he looked at me
He said, ""Mama made Christmas good at our house
Though most years she just did without""
""Tell me, sir, what am I going to do
Somehow I've got to buy her these Christmas shoes""
So I laid the money down, I just had to help him out
And I'll never forget the look on his face when he said
""Mama's gonna look so great""

[Chorus]
Sir, I want to buy these shoes for my Mama, please
It's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size
Could you hurry, sir, Daddy says there's not much time
You see, she's been sick for quite awhile
And I know these shoes would make her smile
And I want her to look beautiful if Mama meets Jesus tonight

I knew I'd caught a glimpse of Heaven's love
As he thanked me and ran out
I knew that God had sent that little boy
To remind me, what Christmas is all about

Sir, I want to buy these shoes for my Mama, please
It's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size
Could you hurry, sir, Daddy says there's not much time

You found a place where you belong
New friends that can do no wrong
That's what you believe
But who is going to be there when you fall
To build up when you're feeling small

Who will, I will

But when you are looking for the things you can't find

Jigga man
Missy, Twista sho' nuff
Yeah, yo

Don't get mad at me
I don't love 'em I fuck 'em
I don't chase 'em I duck 'em
I replace 'em with another one
You had to see she keep calling me BIG
(And another one!)
And my name is Jay-Z
She was all on my dick
Gradually I'm taking over your bitch
Coming over your shit
Got my feet up on you sofas, man
I mean a hostess for my open hand
You coming home to dishes and empty soda cans
I got your bitch up in my Rover man
I never kiss her, I never hold her hand
In fact I diss her I'm a bolder man
I'mma pimp her, it's over man
When I twist her in the Gold sedan
Like I'm Goldie man, you're bitch chose man
Jigga man, iceberg with the frozen hands
Wedding bands don't make it rosy man

[Missy]
Oh is that your chick
Why she all in his six?
With her hand on his dick
Keep licking her lips
Is that your chick?
Why she all in his ride?
With her hand on his thigh
Keep looking in his eyes
Oh is that your chick?
You better tell her chill
While you all in his grill
Don't you know that man kill?
Is that your chick?
Why she beeping him?
Keep praising him?
Cause that's Bleek and them, trick

[Memphis Bleek]
Yo check it now, yo, yo
Your hoe chose I
I ain't gonna lie
What I look like turnin' down chocha
Drove by, smokin' lye
Recognize a pimp, open your eyes
Hop in the passenger side of the ride
Damn Bleek, can't speak
Uh-huh, okay, what's up, SHUT UP
And close the door
Act like you been in the drop top
On the open road before
Fix your weave, then fix me
Ever gave head doing 160?
Ever seen a pair of kicks this crispy
How you love how the white wife beater fit me
M-dot, him hot, them not
(That's gangsta)

[Missy]
Oh is that your chick

[Twista]
Tha Jigga and Twista got 'em screaming
Like a demon fiending for the semen
Chrome gleaming like the dome off Keenan
Gone while I'm leanin' smoking
I'm whip it in the stomach
Your bitch on the passenger side of me flashing your money
Why you acting so funny?
You know she been flirting while your working
Behind the curtain knuckles jerking for certain
Poppin' that pussy
Sweatin' till no fluid is left
When I come in the party with J we gonna do it to death
You gon' ruin your rep
Trippin' while we pimpin' these hefers
Playa lectures got me shining like a new Gator stepper
Must have been mad
When your ho put my stuff in the dash
Bust in her ass
To climax I come up with a nab
The game don't stop
Legit ballers bending up the block
Niggas rushing, coming at us cause of status and props
Sucking and fucking, loving it when I put tha dick up inside her
Can't help it if she yellin' with a ridah

[Missy]
Oh is that your chick

Why you home alone, why she out with me?
Room 112, hotel balcony
How she say Jay you can call the house for me?
There's no respect at all
You betta check her dawg
She keep beggin' me to hit it raw
So she can have my kids and say it was yours
How foul is she? And you wifed her
Shit, I put the rubber on tighter
Sent her home, when she entered home
You hugged her up
What the fuck is up?
She got you whipped, got your kids
Got your home, but that's not your bitch
You share that girl, don't let 'em hear daddy Earl
It'll make 'em sick that his favorite chick
Ain't saving it, unfaithful bitch

Yo how dumb the pimp?

Bought a new five, maybe a six
Copped that for his new down bitch
And I was digging that down since '96 shit
Memph man I'll take your bitch
Let her do her thing, give brain in the whip
And you know how it go when it come to the hoes
She can do the same thing to the clique you know
Your hoe chose, don't get mad at me
Got your wife callin' me daddy
Put her out on the street let her get that cheese
My bad is that your freak
But you know how a thug do

[Jay-Z]
Cool out homie
You betta keep her away from my balling clique
Keep her out of nightclubs all in the mix
From hanging out with chicks who be swallowing dicks
From catz who order Cris play the floor with the Knicks
That can only lead to something unfortunate
Hot boy like Jigga man scorch your bitch
Play the floor dot Jigga man go first
Then we all rock cause we all hot
You know the boys from the Roc got them whores on lock
Got them bitches in the smash
Making yours drive fast
Cause we get more cash than the average nigga
All dem hoes like damn I gotta have this nigga
Cause I'mma hot black, how in the hell can you stop that
You would fuck mine
How the hell can you knock that?
I'm just playing the cards choosenly

71,But For The Grace Of God,"Carlos and Carmen Vidal just had a child
A lovely girl with a crooked smile
Now they gotta split 'cause the Bronx ain't fit
For a kid to grow up in
Let's find a place they say, somewhere far away
With no blacks, no Jews and no gays

There but for the grace of God go I

Papi and the family left the dirty streets
To find a quiet place overseas
And year after year the kid has to hear
The do's, the don'ts and the dears
And when she's ten years old she digs that Rock 'n' Roll
But Papi bans it from home

There but for the grace of God go I

Baby, she turns out to be a natural freak
Gaining weight and losing sleep
And when she's sweet sixteen, she packs her things and leaves
With a man she met on the street
Carmen starts to bawl, bangs her head to the wall
Too much love is worse than none at all

There but for the grace of God go I",The Machine,2000,"[72, 81]",2

73,You Should've Told Me,"[Verse 1]
I wouldn't call in the midnight hour
I wouldn't tuck you in and turn the nightlight out
You would walk through the door and I wouldn't say hi
I would walk out the door and wouldn't say bye-bye
It's funny that I never thought about it that way
I never knew the things that I did not say
But you were lonely and you were hungry
And I was living in my own world
Thinking I'm a perfect lady

[Chorus]
You should've told me
I wasn't small enough
You should've told me
I didn't call enough
But you led me on
And kept me going
And we never should've wasted this time
You should've told me
I wasn't wild enough
You should've told me
I didn't smile enough
What you had in my mind
Made me lose my mind
And we never should've wasted this time

[Verse 2]
I wasn't there to help you take your clothes off
When it was time for work didn't see you off
When your tense didn't give a massage
I never told you I think you're hot
It's funny I never thought about it that way
Never knew the things I did not say
But you were lonely and you were hungry
And I was living in my own world
Thinking I'm a perfect lady

[Chorus]
You should've told me
I wasn't small enough
You should've told me
I didn't call enough
But you led me on
And kept me going
And we never should've wasted this time
You should've told me
I wasn't wild enough
You should've told me
I didn't smile enough
What you had in my mind
Made me lose my mind
And we never should've wasted this time

[Bridge]
When you thought you had to lie
Why didn't you come and tell me why?
Didn't you see those tears I cried?
Oh why?

[Outro]
You should've told me
I wasn't small enough
You should've told me
I didn't call enough
But you led me on
And kept me going
And we never should've wasted this time
You should've told me
I wasn't wild enough
You should've told me
I didn't smile enough
What you had in my mind
Made me lose my mind
And we never should've wasted this time

75,This Everyday Love,"[Intro]
Can't get enough of this everyday love
Can't get enough of this everyday love

[Verse 1]
Each morning the sun shines through my window
Lands on the face of a dream come true
I shuffle to the kitchen for my coffee
And catch up on the front page morning news
Then she walks up behind me
And throws her arms around my neck
Just another normal thing
I've come to expect

[Chorus]
It's ordinary, plain and simple
Typical, this everyday love
Same ol', same ol', keepin' it new (Same ol')
Everyday love
Emotional, so familiar
Nothing about it too peculiar
Oh, but I can't get enough
Of this everyday love, yeah

[Verse 2]
Every afternoon I make a phone call
Listen to the voice that warms my heart
I drag myself through a few more hours
Then head on home to try and beat the dark
Her smile will be right there
When I step through that door
And it will be that way tomorrow
Just like every day before

[Chorus]
It's ordinary, plain and simple
Typical, this everyday love
Same ol', same ol', keepin' it new (Same ol')
Everyday love
Emotional, so familiar
Nothing about it too peculiar
Oh, but I can't get enough
Of this everyday love

[Bridge]
Wouldn't change one single thing about it, no
It's run-of-the-mill
Still, I can't live without it

It's ordinary, plain and simple
Typical, this everyday love

76,You Shouldn't Kiss Me Like This,"[Verse 1]
I got a funny feelin'
The moment that your lips touched mine
Somethin' shot right through me
My heart skipped a beat in time
There's a different feel about you tonight
It's got me thinkin' lots of crazy things
I even think I saw a flash of light
It felt like electricity

[Chorus]
You shouldn't kiss me like this, unless you mean it like that
'Cause I'll just close my eyes and I won't know where I'm at
We'll get lost on this dance floor, spinnin' around
And around and around and around
They're all watchin' us now, they think we're fallin' in love
They'd never believe we're just friends
When you kiss me like this, I think you mean it like that
If you do baby kiss me again

[Bridge]
Everybody swears we make the perfect pair
But dancin' is as far as it goes
Girl you've never moved me quite
Quite the way you moved me tonight
I just wanted you to know
I just wanted you to know

You shouldn't kiss me like this, unless you mean it like that
'Cause I'll just close my eyes and I won't know where I'm at
And we'll get lost on this dance floor, spinnin' around

81,Meanwhile Back At The Ranch,"So, meanwhile back at the ranch
My boy, you grovel for an olive branch
Your arms outstretched, fabrication spoken
You severed all ties and the bond was broken

And it makes me sick
You are the gaffer's best boy

From all that you know
You know everything from Wikipedia and it shows

Because he's full of shit and so are you
You're a weasel and I've had a bird's eye view

You are the gaffer's best boy

It makes me sick

So everyone is at your place
Cameras out for Facebook
Shoe in the face, not one is a friend
There is a reason for this
The pragmatics of which you've seem to have missed

87,A Little Gasoline,"Throwing pictures out the window
Scattered by the way the wind blows
Bye-bye, baby, that's the last I'll see of you
Shoebox full of old love letters
I'll tear each one till I feel better
And I won't look back 'cause I don't like the view

What my heart needs now is rest
So I'm packing up and I'm headed west
My mind's made up, I'll put it to the test
Pushing myself and this old machine
Burning fumes and what's left of my dreams
Let 'em go 'cause I don't need no strings
Just give me a road and a little gasoline

We talked in circles till the words ran out
And it all came down to an angry shout
Before I knew it, I was in third gear and gone
Well, this had been coming for a long, long time
If I said, ""I'm sorry,"" well, I'd be lying
If you think I'll never make it, well, you'd be wrong

What my heart needs now is rest
So I'm packing up and I'm headed west
My mind's made up, I'll put it to the test
Pushing myself and this old machine
Burning fumes and what's left of my dreams
Let 'em go 'cause I don't need no strings
Just give me a road and a little gasoline

What my heart needs now is rest

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
I been a lot of places, seen a lot of faces
Ah hell, I even fucked with different races
A white dude, his name was John
He had a Queen Bee Rules tattoo on his arm
He asked me if I'd be his date for the prom
And he'd buy me a horse, a Porsche and a farm
Dan, my nigga from down south
Used to like me to spank him and cum in his mouth
And Tony, he was Italian
He didn't give a fuck that's what I liked about him
He ate my pussy from dark till the mornin'
Called his girl up and told her we was bonin'
Puerto Rican papi used to be a Deacon
But now he be suckin' me off on the weekend
And this black dude I called King Kong
He had a big ass dick and a hurricane tongue

Roll some weed with some tissue and close your eyes
Then imagine your tongue in between my thighs
Baby, oh, yes oh!
Jailer, open up cell, block eight
Alright nigga, that's enough
Stop, look and listen, get back to your position
Kim got your dick hard, startin' fights in the yard

Up North in the hole, they all wanna know

If you drivin' in the street hold on to your seat
Niggas, grab your meat while I ride the beat
And if you see a shiny black Lamborghini fly by ya
(Shoom!) That's me the Knight Rider
Dressed in all black with the gat in the lap
Lunatics in the street, gotta keep the heat
Sixty on the bezel, a hunnid on the rings
Sittin' pretty baby with a Cash Money bling
12 a.m., I'm on the way to the club
After three bottles I'll be ready to fuck
Some niggas even put me on their grocery list
Right next to the whip cream and box of chocolate
Designer pussy, my shit come in flavors
High-class taste, niggas got to spend paper
Lick it right the first time or you gotta do it over
Like it's rehearsal for a Tootsie commercial

My love goes on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on and on

[Verse 1]
There's only so many stars in the night
That can make up a milky way
And there ain't more
Than twenty-four long hours in a day
But they say everything has a limit
That ain't exactly true
'Cause there ain't a limit to the love in my heart
Or the way that I feel about you

[Chorus]
Hell, even when the pyramids are gone
Yeah, my love goes on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on and on

[Verse 2]
Well, I got two hundred thousand miles
On a rusty old beat up truck
And I hate to say but there's gonna come a day
When I'm gonna have to give her up
But darlin' since I met you
Well, here is how it is
I could live with losing everything
But I would die without your kiss

[Chorus]
So if you think this fire we lit inside
Will burn out, you're wrong
My love goes on and on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on

[Bridge]
Yeah, I know that we can't spend
Every waking hour together
But I can hold you for tonight
And I can love you forever

[Verse 3]
Every time I think of what we've got
All I do is smile
'Cause the beginning to the end of time
Compared to this is a little while
I've heard raindrops'll turn into oceans
And oceans'll turn to dust
But there ain't a single force in the world
That'll have an effect on us

[Chorus]
But that may be that the rocky
Rocky mountains don't last long
But my love goes on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on and on",Chris Cagle,2000,"[91, 83, 79, 76, 76, 83, 84, 87, 94, 94, 99]",11

92,My Baby You,"[Verse 1]
As I look into your eyes
I see all the reasons why
My life's worth a thousand skies
You're the simplest love I've known
And the purest one I'll own
Now you'll never be alone

[Chorus]
My baby you
Are the reason I could fly
And cause of you
I don't have to wonder why
Baby you

[Verse 2]
There's no more just getting by
You're the reason I feel so alive
Though these words I say are true
They still fail to capture you
As mere words can only do
How do I explain that smile
And how it turns my world around
Keeping my feet on the ground

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I will soothe you if you fall
I'll be right there if you call
You're my greatest love of all

You keep telling me you want me
Hold me close all through the night
And I know, that deep inside, you need me
No one else can make it right
Don't you try to hide your secrets
I can see it in your eyes
You said the words without speaking
Now I'm gonna make you mine

[Chorus]
Give me just one night, una noche
A moment to be by your side
Give me just one night, una noche
I'll give you the time of your life
(The time of your life, ooh)
(I'll give you the time of your life)

94,Go On,"[Verse 1]
Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in-vent
I put the heat in vents, man, I've been competing since
I look beyond what people saying, and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there'll never be a sequel
And I'm good with that as long as I'm peaceful
As long as seven years from now I'm taking my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days, man, do they go quick
Just yesterday, I swear it was 'o-six
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed
I looked down, ""Yes, I suppose""

[Chorus]
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel one minute, yeah, we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'ma ride out with you, still the night is young
And we keep going, we go
(We go, we go) We wake back up and do it all again
(We know, we know) Say fuck the world, we riding 'til the end
When all is said and done, look what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it for you

[Verse 2]
I lost my little cousin, to a senseless act of violence
His sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?
Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same
Even though they know that I love 'em
Family ties, broken before me
Niggas trying to kill him, he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me, yes, I get it, I get it was all me
I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes
The last day he saw me

[Chorus]
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel one minute, yeah, we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'ma ride out with you, still the night is young
And we keep going, we go
(We go, we go) We wake back up and do it all again
(We know, we know) Say fuck the world, we riding 'til the end
When all is said and done, look what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it for you

[Verse 3]
Let me make this clear, I'm not difficult, I'm just 'bout my business
I'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel, not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
I love my mother more than life itself and that's a fact
I'd give it all if somehow I could just rekindle that
She never understands why I'm so overprotective
The more I work, the more I feel like somehow they're neglected
I want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say ""We did it!""
My child with Aaron, would've been sixteen any minute
So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah is the both of them
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him
And I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him
And I'm just his little sister, not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him
Gee, we did it, let's leave this imprint
Just finished writing, this is The Pinkprint

I know you've been goin' through some things, uh-huh
I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?
I know you've been runnin' on empty, runnin' on empty
The way you move it's like you could use a vacation
Drink in your hand and the harder you dance
I swear right now it look like you on a vacation
Gotta get away, make it happen
Whatever happened just had to happen
On vacation, yeah
I know you've been, I know you've been

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Dancin', dancin', dancin' like you fucking got a reason
Dancing like it's something to believe in
Dancing like it's fuckin' dancing season
Blame it on the alcohol or blame it on sativa
The harder your heart keep beating
Only feel bad while you're thinkin'
Pop, pop, pop like Pepsi Co. the best we smoke
Plus the tan look like you flew in from Mexico
Go go, let me see how wild it get, bust it wide as it get
You need to be taken care of and pampered
But just like a pamper, he on that childish shit
Yeah, I know you've been silencing your phone
(Silencing your phone, ignoring calls from home)
Uh-huh, I know you've been tryna get along
What's up, it's on, no games, we grown
I know you feel like sometimes
That y'all don't speak the same language
Uh-huh, I know that you just wanna let it go
With all the bitches that you came with

[Verse 2: Jhene Aiko]
I know you've been going through some thangs
Wanna get away, baby, let me be your vacation
That other trick you've been fuckin' with is a trip
You know she be playin', baby I am just saying
I know you know I am down for whatever, yeah
You know I'm just here to make you feel better, yeah
Take a load off on my private island
Come inside and go into hiding
I know that you've been sacrificing your time
And need time to unwind and let go
So let go and let's go and let's roll and we roll

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Excited, activated get ignited
So many charges on my card, oh God I think it got indicted
Get a, get a night, get a day, get a room, get a place
Get a drink, pop a bottle, maybe we can get away
You a star, you need space, we can shoot up by the town
Have you ever been to Texas? South By Southwest
Where we can smoke a zip like we can't get arrested
Where they might know us off any intersection
I mean baby I know you've been, wanna be that baddest
Wanna be with somebody who ain't never had it
No status, just all cinematics, you just got casted

I know you've been crying and poutin'
Know you're tired of arguing but no screaming and shouting
And you know we on a roll like we did good in college

Why? Cause I know you've been going through some things
I know you've been going through some things you can't explain
With your main thing that shit insane
I know you just tryna maintain, that shit is lame, you can't complain
I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?
Don't love the same, I know you've been diving through pain
I know you goin' so crazy, I know you runnin' on empty
That shit can fuck with your mente

You got me tossing and turning

Hey, baby, you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray-tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-Man
She remember my Sprinter, said ""I was in the grape van""
Uhm—well, cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come, Erykah Badu-me—well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said baby, ""Spin that 'round and say the alphabet backwards""
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just 'cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good, though; the head still good, though
Make me say ""Nam Myoho Renge Kyo""
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual, make me believe in miracles
Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kickin' in gratuity
And yeah, G, I was all for it
She said, ""K-Lamar, you kinda dumb to be a poet""
I'ma put you on game for the lames that don't know they a rookie

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Friday night, tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat—somethin' pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second-class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury tastebuds
And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A-list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only got hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preaching to the choir
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky'd and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowin' the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em, really
I remember Amber told my boy
No matter what happens, she ain't goin' back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive need to put up some goddamn barricades
I be paranoid every time, the pressure
The problem ain't I be drivin', the problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby 'Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans, I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over; emcees, cancel your plans
A 38-year-old 8-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took six months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
Goddamn! Got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressin' like Cam
Thank God for me! (Los Angeles)
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neckful
Bitches say he fun-ny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop, like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money (Money, money, money)!
Big, big money (Money, money, money!)
And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker!

[Chorus]
Shake ya ass, but watch yourself
Shake ya ass, show me what you working with

[Verse 1]
I came here with my dick in my hand
Don't make me leave here with my foot in yo' ass; be cool
And don't worry bout how I'm ripping this shit
When I'm flipping what I'm kicking nigga, that's just what I do
I'm effervescent and I'm off that crescent
Nastier than a full grown German Shepherd; motherfucker keep stepping
They don't fuck with me and they don't
Y'all bitches can't catch me and you won't
Pay ya fare, fix your hair, throw that pussy
Got a Prada for bonapalies, and Donna for my babooski
You think I'm tricking? Bitch, I ain't trippin
I'm buyin if you got nice curves for your iceberg
Drinkin Henn and acting like it do something to me
Hope this indecent proposal make you do somethin with me
Fuck a dollar girl, pick up fifty
And fuck that coward, girl, you need a real nigga
Off top knick-a-boxers hurting shit
Bend over ho; show me what you workin with!

[Chorus]
Shake ya ass, but watch yourself
Shake ya ass, show me what you working with

Shake ya ass, but watch yourself
Shake ya ass, show me what you working with

Go head do your job, pop the lock, let the cock out
For girl don't lie you know you wanna go back to my house
""The Man Right Chea"" wanna get under that dress right there
You spicy cajun we gon' a good time over there
You better suck the head on them there crawfish
And you gotta bend all the way over to dance off this
Handle yo' business but I know you do it way better, you dead wrong
So if you talking bout how niggas make noise when you pass by
Get yo' fine ass on the floor girl this yo' fuckin song!
Do yo' thang dont be scared, cause you gon' get served

And I've been beatin that pussy up not smooth fucking
You can betcha bottom dollar; if that pussy fire
You gon' holla Michael Tyler!
So don't act like you don't be backin that stuff up
Girl in the club, cause that's what you got ass for
Wobble wobble I'm infatuated
Bitch ride a dick like she making a baby
And I see that we gon' have to go to a quiet corner for just us two an'
Don't worry about who looking, just keep on doing what you doing
Cause a nigga like me gon' get to work before I know the girl
Bitch what's happening, let 'em see, show the world!

Around here we pop them collars

Every girl I see that look right
A nigga like me just gotta holla

And I saw what you do
And y'all playas really don't want none
From the day to the night, I ROCK
Say what you like, NEVER NOT
Stayin' alive, living the life
Gots to keep it hot
Shotgun in the drop, riding good
Twenties, TVs, leather and wood
Poppin', watching Big Momma
Holdin' it down like a playa should

The tight little guy you ain't seen in a while
Ignore the hype, just right for you size

Braided up, made the bucks
And I'm still a kid
Imagine what life like when I get big
I'mma be rich surrounded by chicks
Couple of cars, couple of cribs
Gettin' a couple of mills
Shining every time I feel
You see how So So get ill
You don't want no stuff up in here
Bow to the wow get it in your ear now
I get down cause I'm hit bound
And I rock an iced out Mickey Mouse around my neck
And I hang on niggas like Vince Carter
With his arm in the net
And I outta snatch up your daughters
But I was brought up with respect
When I turn 16 I'mma call her though
And show her how to ride with a baller yo
Let her know why it wouldn't hurt her
To fall in love with a {nigga} like me a long time ago
Sing-a-long now!

They got money that they jumpin' on the pole to make
Did the motto, took a flight to the golden state
I'm the general, just makin' sure my soldiers straight
Had to leave my nigga, homie got an open case
But I'm big on the west like I'm big in the south
So we gon' pay some people off, we gon' figure it out
And my name too big, and my gang too big

I would pinky swear but my pinky ring too big

I'm letting go, a deeper dive

113,Pop Ya Collar,"[Intro]
Hello everybody
Welcome, today, to the wonderful world of you
Now, check it, you have two options:
You can eat it
Or throw it away

[Verse 1]
See, it's a shame that when you're working hard and doing well People hate you
Buying nothing else but the best for yourself
They really hate you
You gotta live for you and no one else
Don't let them make you feel
Like you're not being real
Just live how you wanna live
You gotta do for you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
(Dig that)
If you work hard, play hard (dig that)
And do what you wanna do (dig that)
Just pop your collar, don't let what people say bother you (dig that)
You perpetrators, I got something to say (dig that)
You can eat it or throw it away (picture that)
You're just mad 'cause you're following in my trap
But can you dig that?

[Chorus]
Hey, ladies (yeah)
Hey, fellas (yeah)
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous
They only hate you cause you're a go-getter
Pop your collar, don't let them sweat you
Hey, ladies (yeah)
Hey, fellas (yeah)
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous
They only hate you cause you're a go-getter
Pop your collar, don't let them sweat you

[Verse 2]
You can see me every week
Hanging out with a different girl sitting next to me
'Cause I'm not about to settle down right now
I gotta be free
Some of y'all fellas might be jealous
But y'all know that don't phase me
I just pop my collar, tip my hat
And turn my back on the ones that hated me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
(Dig that)
Never going home alone (dig that)
If she follows, then you know it's on (dig that)
She use the pager, not the cellular phone (dig that)
I let her know I won't be around for long (dig that)
To all you haters, I got something to say (what's that?)
You can eat it or throw it away (picture that)
Stop hating, wishing, waiting
Anticipating for my heat to fade

[Chorus]
Hey, ladies (yeah)
Hey, fellas (yeah)
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous
They only hate you cause you're a go-getter
Pop your collar, don't let them sweat you
Hey, ladies (yeah)
Hey, fellas (yeah)
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous
They only hate you cause you're a go-getter
Pop your collar, don't let them sweat you

[Bridge]
I break my neck for the things I get
So much sweat, just so I can get that check
And I'm not gonna let nobody bring me down
Nobody's gonna steal the crown
Because I eat good, I live good
I rock good, my life good
If you got a lot and you're working for it
Pop your collar, don't be afraid to show it

[Chorus]
Hey, ladies (yeah)
Hey, fellas (yeah)
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous
They only hate you cause you're a go-getter
Pop your collar, don't let them sweat you
Hey, ladies (yeah)
Hey, fellas (yeah)
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous
They only hate you cause you're a go-getter
Pop your collar, don't let them sweat you
Hey, ladies (yeah)
Hey, fellas (yeah)
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous
They only hate you cause you're a go-getter
Pop your collar, don't let them sweat you
Hey, ladies (yeah)
Hey, fellas (yeah)
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous
They only hate you cause you're a go-getter
Pop your collar, don't let them sweat you
Hey, ladies (yeah)
Hey, fellas (yeah)
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous
They only hate you cause you're a go-getter
Pop your collar, don't let them sweat you
Hey, ladies (yeah)

Back to the day when the innocence died
But you won't be lonely now

115,Spanish Guitar,"[Verse 1:]
A smoky room
A small café
They come to hear you play
And drink and dance the night away
I sit out in the crowd
And close my eyes
Dream you're mine
But you don't know
You don't even know that I am there

[Chorus:]
I wish that I was in your arms
Like that Spanish guitar
And you would play me
Through the night 'til the dawn
I wish you'd hold me in your arms
Like that Spanish guitar
All night long
All night long
I'd be your song
I'd be your song

[Verse 2:]
Steal my heart
With every note you play
I pray you'll look my way
And hold me to your heart someday
I long to be the one
That you caress with tenderness
And you don't know
You don't even know that I exist

[Chorus:]
I wish that I was in your arms
Like that Spanish guitar
And you would play me
Through the night 'til the dawn
I wish you'd hold me in your arms
Like that Spanish guitar
All night long
All night long
I'd be your song
I'd be your song

Te sientas entre la gente
Cierras tu ojos
Y sueñas que soy tuyo
Pero yo no sé ni siquiera que estas ahí
Me gustaría tenerte entre mis brazos amor

A black teller when my father bust and unloaded me
Think he just finished sniffin a ki, and dippin the D's
Don't hate me, hate Nicky Barnes for hittin my moms
Letting the condom pop, nigga I was born in the drop
Coke boil in the pot, shake the Feds
And bust shots at them street cops
Fuck yo' point is? My point is double fours at your fuckin jaws
Pointed, hollow point shit
Four-point-six, need I say more?
Or do you get the point bitch? C'mon

Wipe the tears from my eyes; no love?
Fuck y'all niggas! I hope you die a slow death

Can't fuck with you weak rap niggas, witcha gay raps
Runnin 'round talkin this and talkin that
See me in the streets, tried to give me dap
Andrew Cunanan ass niggas
My two cannons blast niggas, ask niggas
Got me fucked up in the game, get your shirt stained
Keep your five mics nigga, give me the 'caine
Do the shit to clean my money dummies, gleamed the wrist out

Bling bling, it's a Bad Boy thing
Bullets heat-seekin, streep sweepin, with an evil grin
Watch you die, one love, one life, one Shyne
Y'all niggas ain't sayin nothin, like a mime
Every line, I live it, I write it with a pencil so niggas die
Of lead poison if they bite it, hate it but recite it
It's a G thang, me and Puff in St. Bart's set it off
Bitches walkin topless with G-strings, menage'
Bust shots at your crew, another charge
As the gulf stream fly through the fog
Make ya popular
Pockets filled with more high notes than the opera
Franklins on top of the - Jacksons
My nigga Ty leave you tired
Bad Boy, repsect it or die, coward

Suffocation, no breathing

Cut my life into pieces
I've reached my last resort – suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck, if I cut my arms bleeding
Do you even care, if I die bleeding?
Would it be wrong, would it be right
If I took my life tonight? Chances are that I might
Mutilation out of sight
And I'm contemplatin' suicide

'Cause I'm losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine

[Verse 2]
I never realized I was spread too thin
Till it was too late and I was empty within
Hungry, feeding on chaos and livin' in sin
Downward spiral, where do I begin?
It all started when I lost my mother
No love for myself and no love for another
Searchin' to find a love upon a higher level
Findin' nothin' but questions and devils

Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losin' my sight, losin' my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine

Cut my life into pieces
This is my last resort
Suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding
Would it be wrong, would it be right
If I took my life tonight? Chances are that I might
Mutilation out of sight
And I'm contemplating suicide

I mean I just got a lot of things on my mind
I gotta think about, you know
Just umm, I'll be over Brian's house
You know, just for the night
I mean, I know things are different, but you know
It's not you, it's me, you know, it's really me, you know
And basically, I just think I'ma need some space

Why you calling me on the phone?
Why you not at home on time?
You say you're staying over your friends
Cause you've got a lot on your mind
Now you're swearing up and down that it ain't me
So you say that things have changed
So tell me what exactly does it mean
When you say you need your space?
Just don't make no excuses, no no

Why you gotta lie to me?

Baby, you don't gotta lie to me, no

I mean, you gotta understand I love you
You know what I'm saying
And I love you enough to say that I think
I think you deserve somebody better than me, you know
And right now, I can't give you what you need, you know
I mean, I wanna love you and I'm gonna love you
One day but you know...
I mean, you just gotta understand where I'm coming from

[Verse 2: Toni Braxton]
You say right now that you're not what I'm looking for
And what you really need is time to grow
You're promising that one day you may come around
And I'm supposed to let that go
But where the hell do you get off?
Telling me your mama said I'm not what you need
Tell you what, since she knows it all
Then that's where you need to be
Just don't make no excuses, no no

Can you tell me how
You can say you're in love
And then treat me so bad?

The way you handled things
You want to lie

119,That Other Woman,"[Intro]
I can't be that other woman
I can't be that other woman

[Verso 1]
You only see me every Friday night at nine
Can't imagine what you told her this time
You never take me to a public place
Worried that somebody might notice your face
Rush to the liquor store and then a motel
Call up your friends just to cover you're trail
Not a word until the week goes by
You call me when you want some pie

[Pre-Chorus]
Why am I crying every night over you
You're never gonna leave her
Finally I woke up and smell the coffee
I understand
Why two women can't share one man

[Chorus]
I can't be that other woman
I can't love you down
Can't keep creepin' around
Can't be that other woman
Yes I want you bad
But she needs you much more
I can't be that other woman
I can't love you down
Can't keep creepin' around
Can't be that other woman
Yes I want you bad
But she needs you much more

[Verse 2]
You never see me on the holidays
You disappear and won't return my page
You take my body in the middle of night
I ain't gon lie cause boy you do it so right
And then you melt with them same three words
Sweetest seduction that I've ever heard
And in the morning with the sun rise
You run to her I realize

[Pre-Chorus]
Why am I crying every night over you
You're never gonna leave her
Finally I woke up and smell the coffee
I understand
Why two women can't share one man

[Chorus]
I can't be that other woman
I can't love you down
Can't keep creepin' around
Can't be that other woman
Yes I want you bad
But she needs you much more
I can't be that other woman (See)
I can't love you down (What goes around comes around)
Can't keep creepin' around
Can't be that other woman
Yes I want you bad (I want you oh so bad)
But she needs you much more (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
Can I get a witness
(Yes you can)
Can I get a witness
(oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can I get a witness
(You know you can)
Have you ever been in love with another girl's man
Can I get a witness
(Yes you can)
Can I get a witness
(oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You said you're leaving a thousand times
But I won't believe til the papers are signed

[Chorus]
Can't be that other woman
I won't believe it no
I gotta be the only one
Yes I want you bad
But she needs you much more
I can't be that other woman
I can't love you down
Can't keep creepin' around (No more late night booty calls)
Can't be that other woman
Yes I want you bad
But she needs you much more

[Intro]
Yeah, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-d-doo, diggy-doo, yo

[Hook]
There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me

[Verse 1]
I never knew a luh, luh-luh, a love like this
Gotta be somethin' for me to write this
Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter, and finally decide to send it
Signed, sealed, delivered, for us to grow together
Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I ain't gon' assault them, ‘cause I probably did it too
Because of you, feelings I handle with care
Some niggas recognize the light
But they can't handle the glare
You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin' shirts
If relationship is effort I will match your work
I want to be the one to make you happiest
And hurt you the most
They say the end is near, it's important that we close
To the most high
Regardless of what happen, on Him let's rely

[Hook]
There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me

[Verse 2]
It's important we communicate
And tune the fate of this union to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch or even my boo
There's so much in a name and so much more in you
Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But that's fly by night, for you in the sky I write
For in these cold Chi night's moon, you my light
If Heaven had a height, you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all
Let's stick to understandin' and we won't fall
For better or worse times, I hope to me you call
So I pray every day more than anything
Friends we'll stay as we begin to lay
This foundation for a family, love ain't simple
Why can't it be anything worth havin' you work at annually?
Granted we known each other for some time
It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine

[Hook]
There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me

[Verse 3]
It's kind of fresh you listen to more than hip-hop
And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you shit pop when it's time to
Thinkin' you fresh, suggestin' beats I should rhyme to
At times when I'm lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when it's time to
My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness
Truthfully it's hard tryin' to practice abstinence
The time we committed love, it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex ain't gon' keep you
But as my equal, it's how I must treat you
As my reflection in light I'ma lead you
And whatever's right I'ma feed you
Digga-da, digga-da, digga-da, digga-digga-da-da
Yo, I tell you the rest when I see you; peace!

There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side

121,Where I Wanna Be,"[Verse 1]
I just left my baby girl a message
Sayin' I won't be coming home
I'd rather be alone
She doesn't fully understand me
Cause I'd rather leave than to cheat
If she gives me some time
I can be the man she needs
But there's a lot of lust inside of me
And we've been together since our teenage years
I really don't mean to hurt her, but I need some time
To be alone

[Hook 1]
But when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
Oh, how I feel so sad
Now that I wanna leave
She's crying her heart to me
How could you let this be?
I just need time to see
Where I wanna be
Where I wanna be...

Sweet little dee-do-dee-dee...
I don't mean to hurt you, baby, oh, no, no...

[Verse 2]
Never did I imagine
That you would play a major part
In a decision that's so hard
Do I leave, do I stay, do I go?
Or think about my life and what matters to me the most
Girl, the love that we share is real
But in time your heart will heal
I'm not saying I'm gone, but I
Have to find what life is like
Without you

[Hook 1]
But when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
Oh, how I feel so sad
Now that I wanna leave
She's crying her heart to me
How could you let this be?
I just need time to see
Where I wanna be
Where I wanna be...

Sweet little dee-do-dee-dee...
I don't mean to hurt you, baby

[Hook 2]
See when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
Oh, how I feel so sad
Now that I wanna leave
She's crying her heart to me
How could you let this be?
And I just need time to see
Where I wanna be

[Hook 2]
See when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
Oh, how I feel so sad
Now that I wanna leave
She's crying her heart to me
How could you let this be?
And I just need time to see

[Hook 2]
See when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
Oh, how I feel so sad

The popular one with the rising stock
So that's when I had this bright idea
(Throw the party of the month)
No, the party of the year
All the fine girls couldn't turn it down
Now all I gotta do is get my parents out
Should I send them to a movie
(No, send them to a show)
Let me think, hmmm
It's gotta be long though

It's a Friday night, have you seen Aunt Joan
And don't worry about stayin' out too long
Don't fuss over me, I'll be fine alone
Have a good time...

On my Mom's new cushion
I turned around and

I don't even wanna start thinkin' about dad

When I'm the one who said I didn't want it to work
Don't you forget I had him first

Didn't he tell you the truth?

And why we couldn't work it out

You got to treat her like a lady and she'll give in to you

But most of all you got to please her (please her)
You got to hold her (hold her) and want her (want her)
And make her feel you'll always need her (need her)
You know a woman (woman) is sentimental (woman)
And so easy (woman) to upset (woman)
So make her feel (feel) that she's for real, yeah (real)

And they go deep inside of you

And I'd say that I'm sorry to you

But then I want to call you 'cause I don't want to crush you
But I feel like crushing you
And it's true I took for granted you were with me

And we were broke and didn't know

Something's gone, you withdraw and I'm not strong like before I was

We can go bowling, it ain't like before
Can't y'all see that I'm growing? I was so immature
I was young and having money
Having honeys come to the crib
Dig in their shit
And they couldn't get cab money from me
Some bad chicks didn't get past the bridge
I went to 1 Trump Plaza on their asses
No room service, just snacks and shit
Work with those Lil Debbies
And when you're done, get ready
The chicks I was fiending to smash
Let 'em lean on the cash
Will take 'em on long trips
Break 'em with long dick
There was no such thing as strong relationships
But I'm off that player shit
I need a chick that practice Tai Chi
That still can buy weed
And can give me some good head
And I'll make her a mami

Love the way I push my slang
Calling my jack soon as they hop in my V
They catching contact, weed smoke all up in the weave

[Krazy]
Fresh out the courthouse, fuck the world, I'm finally free
Ask them bitch niggas who snitch, is they ready for me
My proverbs to the tank, believe I love it
Since that ""Bout' It Bout' It"" album, I was dreamin' of it
Ride wit' me, through the south, as I cruise through Texas
A young soldier, wit' about a hundred grand in my Lexus
On my way from Houston, after I scored the coke
I rather, step to jail than my family be broke
But I owe five hours, I can barely breathe
Please lord forgive me for my sins, I got kids to feed
Ain't no nigga in the Iberville givin' me shit
They went from trick to a bitch and buy that ho a fit
But my souljas, before it's over off top
Before I'm sayin' to my dogs everytime the dope is chopped
Feel that, my niggas will ride wit' me
Snoop and Master P said that they'll die for me

Well the weatherman said it might storm today
I got to hit the field
Got to bail some hay
And I can't let it rain on my daddy's farm
'Til I get it all stacked up high in the barn
And I'm going to call my baby

She lives down town on Sycamore Street
And the wheels on the black top
A starting to whine
As I pass that Oklahoma City limit sign

I'm a hayseed
And a plow boy
I'm a farm kid
And a cowboy
I'm a roughneck
My daddy was a roughneck too

You better be ready when the sun goes down
That's when country comes to town

[Verse 2]
Well her Daddy said child you better let him be
Well I don't like him and he sire don't like me
Momma just says ya'll have a little fun
Ain't doing nothing me and papa ain't done
Open up the door to my pick-up truck
And my baby jumps in and she fires it up
And she gives me a kiss
As I crawl in
We've been waiting all week for a weekend

I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in vain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand

I dream of fire
Those dreams are tied to a horse that will never tire
And in the flames
Her shadows play in the shape of a man's desire

This desert rose
Each of her veils, a secret promise
This desert flower
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this

And as she turns
This way she moves in the logic of all my dreams
This fire burns
I realize that nothing's as it seems

I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in vain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand

I dream of rain
I lift my gaze to empty skies above
I close my eyes
This rare perfume is the sweet intoxication of her love

152,Everything You Want,"[Verse 1]
Somewhere there's speaking
It's already coming in
Oh and it's rising at the back of your mind
You never could get it
Unless you were fed it
Now you're here and you don't know why
But under skinned knees and the skid marks
Past the places where you used to learn
You howl and listen
Listen and wait for the
Echoes of angels who won't return

[Chorus]
He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why

[Verse 2]
You're waiting for someone
To put you together
You're waiting for someone to push you away
There's always another wound to discover
There's always something more you wish he'd say

[Chorus]
He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why

[Bridge]
But you'll just sit tight
And watch it unwind
It's only what you're asking for
And you'll be just fine
With all of your time
It's only what you're waiting for

[Verse 3]
Out of the island
Into the highway
Past the places where you might have turned
You never did notice
But you still hide away
The anger of angels who won't return

[Chorus]
He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why

[Chorus 2]
I am everything you want
I am everything you need
I am everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
I say all the right things
At exactly the right time
But I mean nothing to you and I don't know why

...Man, whatever

[Intro]
Dre, just let it run
Ayo, turn the beat up a little bit
Ayo
This song is for anyone...
Fuck it, just shut up and listen
Ayo

[Verse 1]
I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zag's and this bag
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this... on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension, dispensin' these sentences
Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off
Of this chest and I rest again peacefully (Peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
To not come and speak to me (Speak to me), I don't know you
And no, I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me, my tank is on empty (Is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you ten feet (Liftin' you ten feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you (Of all you), I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be, it's just me

[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content
The song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses.""
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (Finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn (On Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at!
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city
Havin' this happenin' (This happenin') then attack
Eminem 'cause I rap this way (Rap this way) but I'm glad
'Cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire to burn
And it's burnin', and I have returned

[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 3]
I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top a ""My Name Is""
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (Got the patience)
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
Who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause I talk
With an accent and grab on my balls so they always
Keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (Fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (Drivin' me crazy), I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without
Someone standin' by it! (Standin' by it) No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

[Chorus]
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Woodie]
I live a lifestyle, covered up by dark clouds
Dealin' with these suckas, but they only seem to bark loud
Still I keep a strap for when I come across a killa
I dreamt the day I'll have to fight that killa in the mirror
I wake up every mornin', hit my fifth and hope I live
Just another day to see what tomorrow's got to give
I'm addicted to the liquor
And at days I peel the sticker off another 40 ounce
And wonder, ""How did my life get here?""
My ole goes in stayin' drunk and eliminatin' funk
Fuckin' hoes or rollin' triple golds always up in the trunk
My mother asks me everyday, ""Are you still bangin?""
I lie and tell her, ""No"", but her heart knows I ain't changed none
I hate to see her cry, wipe the tears from her eyes
And try to tell her everything is gonna be alright
I hug her tightly, as I leave it bothers me
But for now I gotta go, cuz these streets are callin' me

[Hook: repeat 2X]
My mother prays that I quit the life I lead
Damn I try to change my ways, but these streets are callin' me
And I love her to death, but at the same time I'm a souljah
I gotta put in work, let rivals know they can't get over

[Woodie]
I'm a yoc influenced souljah taking chances
I'm levelin' with all my homeboys up in drug induced trances
Evil dances through our thoughts as we plot different strategies
To kill our enemies and not get caught
My homie got shot in the spine, he's been paralyzed
I see nothin' but deep despair when I stare into his eyes
I feel my anger rise as I think about his character
He never hurt nobody, just a homeboy that was there for ya
These streets are really fair, and that's a hard lesson learned
But you realize quick enough after up three time getting burned
The streets are cold, bits of love but mostly greed is all they hold
You in my way, I'll burn a load and make yo head explode, [Now what]
That's my moto
Livin' in the bottle, hit the throttle
Let this shit start to get you thick, break out the fully-auto [scrap killa]

[Hook] - 2X

[Woodie]
Just got done
Creasin' up my khakis, put my NIKES on
I hear my homeboys outside honkin' the horn
I guess tonight's on
Grabbed the tray snubby
Give my moms a kiss goodbye
As I hop into the ride
She prays that I come home alive
I can't justify my life because I know I'm livin' wrong
What the fuck do you expect me to do when the funk is on
Tryin' to get along, with my rivals
Foo, you must be jokin'
What you smokin?
Hollow tips and pistols clips is what I got for fools approachin'
I'm tryin' to get ahead
Spitin' high-lead at these rivals ramped up
In this life of vega got me homicidal
Better check my vital signs
Since I'm livin half dead by the thoughts
Got my brain washed, fuckin' with my head
Break a sweat up in my bed
Dude, the nightmares got my body tense
But still I'm prepared to die for this so called nonsense
Cuz everything is fucked up
The whole world is corrupt
I'll never switch up on my homies
So consider me stuck, fucked
I ain't trippin' though
Yeah my money's sittin' low
But still I got enough to get a four-0 at the liquor store
And clothes on my back, plus a gat for these rivals
All my only necessities for survival

Woah, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy, but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (Yah I said it)
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food
Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you
Fuck you too, woo!

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'
You mighta went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time
I ain't no gangster but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of nines
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My 12 days of Christmas was nothin' but lies (I)
Run at you hard like a sumo (Sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (Chulo)
I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno (Woo)
Bitch I'm a dog, call me Cujo (Rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw 4 like a Uno (Bup)
Cállate boca mejor, maricón, little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)
They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now
Shit get relevant 'til 'nother beef die down
In truth, a nigga just really want me tied down
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope (Yeah)
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
Nigga, wrong way, wrong road (Woo, woo)
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (Vroom!)

[Pre-Verse: Eminem]
I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em
Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference?
I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man, I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I've been eatin' long enough, man, my stomach should be full
I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me
Fuck you think? (Woo!)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I got a couple of mansions
Still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghost writers
But to these kids it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop?""
I said, ""I don't have any answers.""
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, ""What a wonderful feeling!""
""We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!""
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap
Let's recap, way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They know what button to press or what lever to pull
To get me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya digs in the fuckin' back, ho (Get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least 70 or 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I wrote 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain to pour
In that drought, y'all been prayin' for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboy

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas & Eminem]
So y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice",Eminem,2000,"[100, 86, 66, 40, 30, 29, 23, 26, 28, 41, 61]",11

You should return all your beats to who made 'em
Because that was not what they made for
I take my words and I wage war, I'm the best out I can assure
I can guarantee it, I just let it be it
I just say less while they say more
I stand my ground like on a fort, winning because I am a sore-

Lowlife, yo' life, boy, we livin' it up
Takin' chances while we dancin' in the party for sure
Slipped my ho a forty-fo' when she got in the back do'
Bitches lookin' at me strange, but you know I don't care
Step up in this motherfucker just a-swangin' my hair
Bitch, quit talkin', Crip walk if you down with the set
Take a bullet with some dick and take this dope on this jet
Out of town, put it down for the Father of Rap
And if yo' ass get cracked, bitch, shut yo' trap
Come back, get back, that's the part of success

171,Whatever,"[Intro]
Das war mit Abstand die schlimmste Woche
Die ich in meinem Leben je hatte
Ich weiß nicht, ob ich aufstehen soll
Und ich hab kein'n Plan, was ich mache
Denn irgendwie ist alles scheiße
Ich war noch nie so weit am Boden
Denn ich weiß, mein ganzes Geld ist weg
Und meine Frau hat mich betrogen
Uah, whatever!

[Hook]
Bye bye, ich fühl' mich so frei, frei
Ich will nicht mehr heim
Denn mir ist scheißegal, was morgen kommt
Ich heb' mein Glas und schrei':
Bye bye, ich fühl' mich so frei, frei
Ich will nicht mehr heim
Denn mir ist scheißegal, was morgen kommt
Ich heb' mein Glas und schrei' …

[Part 1]
In den Spiegel, Mann, ich brauche nichts außer dich
Wir beide packen das, ich hab' dich, du hast mich
Und hat irgendjemand von uns beiden sich mal verpisst
War das sicher wegen Geld oder irgendeiner Chick
Jetzt bin ich frei, frei, und steh' wieder auf
Ich bin allein und schrei', „Es geht wieder raus.“
Spring' in die Nikes, fly, und geh' wie der Baus
In Zeitlupe in den Club, es hat ewig gebraucht
Doch es ist Samstagnacht, ich werd' langsam wach
Und bezahl die erste Runde mit 'nem Handschlag – passt!
Was geht ab? Cro, guck mal, das ist meine Welt
Meine Hobbys sind, äh, schubsen oder Beine stellen
Oder hin und wieder bisschen faul auf 'ner Couch
Manchmal allein und manchmal mit Frauen
Doch heut bin ich im Club, nein, ich komme nicht heim
Denn wir feiern durch die Nacht, bis die Sonne wieder scheint, yeah!

[Hook]
Bye bye, ich fühl' mich so frei, frei
Ich will nicht mehr heim
Denn mir ist scheißegal, was morgen kommt
Ich heb' mein Glas und schrei':
Bye bye, ich fühl' mich so frei, frei
Ich will nicht mehr heim
Denn mir ist scheißegal, was morgen kommt
Ich heb' mein Glas und schrei' …

[Part 2]
Ich wache auf, schaue raus, kein'n Plan wo ich bin
Das ganze Haus voller Frauen, ey, die schlafen bestimmt
Meine Hose ist zerrissen und der Wagen ist hin
Geh' in die Küche, mach' mir erst einmal 'nen Kaffee mit Jim
Setz' mich hin, WhatsApp, was geht, bin hier
Und leb', doch geh' demnächst zu dir
Okay, und falls irgendjemand schon weiß
Was heute Abend geht, dann bitte, bitte gebt mir Bescheid
Denn ich bin irgendwie im Modus, deshalb will ich nicht heim
Probleme lös' ich locker mit 'nem billigen Wein
Gib mir noch 'n Schluck, noch 'n Schluck, noch 'n Schluck, noch 'n Schluck
Noch 'n Schluck – jap, ich bin dabadabadai!
Also gib, gib, gib, gib, gib mir 'n Becks!
Und ich kipp', kipp', kipp', kipp', kipp' es auf Ex!

Hab'n den Whiskey gegrabbt und verpissen sich jetzt

I wanna be where the commas will be
But I need a hood nigga with the llama degree
Get the limited edition, Audemars, it could be
In a pivotal position, gotta pardon the fee
Cause he bought a couple bags and he sent a couple whips
And he took a couple trips, then its dinner and a Myx
And he's never with no other chick, fronting like he's slick
Cause it's levels to this shit, and she could never be Nic
Niggas be fallin' in love with this pussy
Mean stew chicken, and bake him a couple of cookies
Dick on veteran, ain't fucking with rookies
Saw the High School video now he wanna play hookie
Baddest bitch, I'm the catalyst
Ain't never been done, bitch I added this
Nah, I ain't gotta shoot, I got mad assists

Voom, voom, oh yeah, big bank, I'm too real
My money right in them boys you with be dead broke, two years

And so I surrendered, just to hear your voice

And maybe someone else is standing there beside you
But there's something, baby that you need to know

That deep inside me, I feel like I'm dying
I have to see you, it's all that I'm asking
Baby, give me back my fantasy
The courage that I need to live
The air that I breathe
Living without you, my world's become so empty
The days are so cold and lonely
And each night I taste the purest of pain

Que no me ha afectado lo de tu partida

I hope you never lose your sense of wonder
You get your fill to eat
But always keep that hunger
May you never take one single breath for granted
God forbid love ever leave you empty handed

Whenever one door closes
I hope one more opens

And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
Never settle for the path of least resistance
Living might mean taking chances
But they're worth taking
Loving might be a mistake
But it's worth making

Don't let some Hell-bent heart leave you bitter
When you come close to selling out
Reconsider
Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

[Chorus:]
I hope you dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance

Always rolling us along
Tell me who wants to look back on their years
And wonder where those years have gone)

I always was the one with all the love
You came along, I'm hunting you down

Like a sick domestic abuser looking for a fight
And all I wanted was the simple things
A simple kind of life

If we met tomorrow for the very first time
Would it start all over again?
Would I try to make you mine?

I always thought I'd be a mom
Sometimes I wish for a mistake
The longer that I wait the more selfish that I get
You seem like you'd be a good dad

Now all those simple things
Are simply too complicated for my life
How'd I get so faithful to my freedom?
A selfish kind of life
When all I ever wanted was the simple things
A simple kind of life",No Doubt,2000,"[98, 100, 88, 85, 80, 55, 52, 48, 38, 38, 39, 40, 50]",13

W powietrzu czuć już damski zapach perfum
Ktoś urwał film i chyba będzie miał ktoś nowych teściów
Kino akcji, Wściekłe psy, nie saga Zmierzchu
Robię flipa jakąś deską, bliską memu sercu
Patrz Pasza, ta noc to jakiś Rajd Dakar
Każda dupa ma na ścianie tutaj nasz plakat
O i czeka nas apokalipsa

183,I'll Be,"[Album Intro: Puff Daddy]
Every day I wake up, I hope I'm dreamin'
I can't believe this shit
Can't believe you ain't here
Sometimes it's just hard for a nigga to wake up
It's just hard to just keep goin'
It's like I feel empty inside without you bein' here
I would do anything man, to bring you back
I'd give all this shit, shit don't mean nothing
I saw your son today, he look just like you
You was the greatest, you'll always be the greatest
I miss you B.I.G
Can't wait 'til that day, when I see your face again
I can't wait 'til that day, when I see your face again

Goes out to everyone that has lost someone
That they truly loved (C'mon, check it out)

[Verse 1: Puff Daddy]
Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin' on the block for dough
Notorious, they got to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone, we still a team
Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream (That's right)
In the future, can't wait to see
If you open up the gates for me
Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real, feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anythin' to hear half your breath (Half your breath)
I know you still livin' your life after death

[Refrain: Faith Evans & Puff Daddy]
Every step I take, every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missin' you
Thinkin' of the day when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missin' you
(I miss you B.I.G.)

[Verse 2: Puff Daddy]
It's kinda hard with you not around
Know you in heaven, smilin' down
Watchin' us while we pray for you
Every day we pray for you
'Til the day we meet again
In my heart is where I'll keep you, friend
Memories give me the strength I need to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts Big I just can't define (Can't define)
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me takin' flicks
Makin' hits, stages they receive you on
Still can't believe you're gone (Can't believe you're gone)
Give anything to hear half your breath (Half your breath)
I know you still livin' your life after death

[Refrain: Faith Evans]
Every step I take, every move I make (I miss you)

Somebody tell me why
One glad morning
When this life is over
I know I'll see your face

Before you came around I asked myself
What is this thing called love
There were clouds, the rain kept pouring down
Then you brought the sun, yes you did
Showed me all the differences
Between a woman and a girl
Right then I knew I could be a good man
With you inside my world, my world, my world

I don't need to take a toke
Cuz I'm on a natural high
Everybody's blowing smoke

Friends say that we in a pinch
They're just hating their lies
I know they want what I got
It comes once in a lifetime, yeah

Like rainbows and shining stars

Like diamond rings and fancy cars
Baby you are

I was a bad seed
And you nourished me, encouraged me
'Till I grew tall as a tree, as a tree
You had patience to search
Find and bring out all the best in me, yes you did
You see things I couldn't see
My mental potential
Girl you showed me, yeah
Now it's a reality
And I promise for you I'm gonna be all that I can be

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need to take a toke
Cuz I'm on a natural high

We're gonna have a problem here...

[Verse 1]
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, suin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the ""Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said… nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who,"" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though.""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes—

[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 2]
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee.""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 3]
I'm like a head trip to listen to, ‘cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than 90% of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can
Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, ‘cause at the rate, I'm going, when I'm 30
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Man, it's a hot one
Like seven inches from the midday sun
I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone
But you stay so cool
My muñequita, my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason, the step in my groove

[Chorus]
And if you say this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth
And it's just like the ocean under the moon
It's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth
Gimme your heart, make it real, or else forget about it

[Verse 2]
I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it would be a crying shame
In every breath and every word
I hear your name calling me out
Out from the barrio, you hear my rhythm from your radio
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow
Turning you round and round

I could change my life to better suit your mood

‘Cause I don't fuckin' need 'em
Take 'em out the hood, keep 'em lookin' good
But I don't fuckin' feed 'em
First time they fuss I'm breezin'
Talkin' about, ""What's the reasons?""
I'm a pimp in every sense of the word
Bitch, better trust and believe 'em
In the cut where I keep 'em
'Til I need a nut, 'til I need to beat the guts
Then it's ""beep beep"" and I'm pickin' them up
Let 'em play with the dick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga's fists in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good head
I'ma break bread, so you can be livin' it up?
Shit, I part with nothin', y'all be frontin'
Me give my heart to a woman?
Not for nothin', never happen; I'll be forever mackin'
Heart cold as assassins, I got no passion
I got no patience and I hate waitin'
Ho, get your ass in and let's ride!

Hoes start pointin', they say: ""There he go!""
Now these motherfuckers know we carry mo'
Heat than a little bit
We don't pull it out over little shit
And if you catch a lick when I spit
Then it won't be a little hit
Go read a book, you illiterate son of a bitch!
And step up your vocab!
Don't be surprised if your ho stab out with me
And you see us comin' down on yo' SLAB
Livin' ghetto-fabulous, so mad, you just can't take it
But nigga if you hatin' I
Then you wait while I get your bitch butt-naked
Just break it; you gotta pay like you weigh
Wet with two pairs of clothes on
Now get yo' ass to the back as I'm flyin' to the track
Timbaland, let me spit my prose on
Pump it up in the pro-zone
That's the track that we breakin' these hoes on
Ain't the track that we flows on
But when shit get hot then the Glock start poppin' like ozone
We keep hoes crunk like Trigger-man
For real, it don't get no bigger, man
Don't trip, let's flip, gettin' throwed on the flip
Gettin' blowed with the motherfuckin' Jigga Man, fool!

Smokin' out, pourin' up
Keepin' lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood
In my hood we call it ""buck""
Everybody wanna ball
Holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall
Nigga, I can't fuck with y'all
If I wasn't rappin', baby
I would still be ridin' Mercedes
Comin' down and sippin' daily
No record 'til whitey pay me
Uhh, now what y'all know about them Texas boys?
Comin' down in candied toys
Smokin' weed and talkin' noise

Made my money quick, then back to the streets
But still sittin' on blades, sippin' that Ray
Standin' on the corner of my block, hustlin'
Still gettin' that 'caine
Half what I paid slippin' right through customs
It'll sell by night, its egg shell white
I got so many grams, if the man find out
It will land me in jail for life

The ten-dollar Founding Father without a father
Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
By being a lot smarter
By being a self-starter
By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a trading charter

[THOMAS JEFFERSON]
And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted
Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter

Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain

[BURR]
Well, the word got around, they said, “This kid is insane, man”
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland

We must go our separate ways

201,The Chain Of Love,"He was driving home one evening
In his beat up Pontiac
When an old lady flagged him down;
Her Mercedes had a flat
He could see that she was frightened
Standing out there in the snow
'Till he said ""I'm here to help you ma'am
By the way, my name's Joe.""

She said, ""I'm from St. Louis""
And I'm only passing through
I must've seen a hundred cars go by
This is awful nice of you.""

When he changed the tire, and closed her trunk
And was about to drive away
She said, ""How much do I owe you?""

Here's what he had to say:

You don't owe me a thing
I've been there too
And someone once helped me out
Just the way I'm helping you
If you really wanna pay me back
Here's what you do:
Don't let the chain of love end with you

Well a few miles down the road
The lady saw a small cafe
She went in to grab a bite to eat
And then be on her way
But she couldn't help but notice
How the waitress smiled so sweet
And how she must've been eight months along
And dead on her feet

No, she didn't know her story
And she probably never will
When the waitress went to get her change
From a hundred dollar bill
The lady slipped right out the door
And on a napkin left a note
There were tears in the waitress's eyes
When she read what she wrote:

You don't owe me a thing
I've been there too
And someone once helped me out
Just the way I'm helping you
If you really wanna pay me back
Here's what you do:
Don't let the chain of love end with you

That night when she got home from work
The waitress climbed into bed
She was thinking 'bout the money
And what the lady's note had said
As her husband lay there sleeping
She whispered soft and low:
""Everything's gonna be alright; I love you, Joe.""",Clay Walker,2000,"[95, 94, 94, 90, 81, 71, 68, 57, 53, 44, 45, 40, 43, 44, 48, 51, 57, 57, 65, 73]",20
202,West Side Story,"[Verse 1]
Tried to get the audience out from inside my head
And the things you say are beautiful, but they don’t make very much sense
From the day that I was born, they took me for all that I had
And I let them
‘Cause they let me in
I'm so weak, I can barely hold this instrument

[Chorus]
I wanna do whatever you wanna do
I wanna make fun of cops with you

[Verse 2]
You went on tour and I went on medication
I’ve been stuck in this waiting room and they’re telling me to stay patient
So, I’ll close my eyes and I’ll sing this song for you
Celebrate with a joint or two
And a new backyard tattoo
And think of the time that we spent watching X-Files in your living room

[Chorus]
I wanna do whatever you wanna do
I wanna find every truth with you

[Verse 3]
And it all comes down to the knowledge that we’re gonna die
Find comfort in that or be scared for the rest of your life
So, I sing and I scream and I strum and I try to help out
’Til I can build a little house
That the government doesn’t know about
But I’d rather be right here than anywhere else, right now

[Chorus]
I wanna do whatever you wanna do
I wanna watch the empire fall with you

[Bridge]
And it’s fucking with me that you didn’t see
That it wasn’t them and it was always me who knew too much
And I’m no storyteller the way you are
I’m just an angry kid who got given a guitar
But how dare you say that I’m too young
To know that the ticket prices are going up
And the trains still aren’t on time
And the thugs that patrol the lines are the reason I’ll never pay my fines
And prescription prices are going up
And we’re not making any more money
Tony’s wallet’s getting heavy
Gina, your stomach is far from empty
And it’s too many in my mind
And now I’m living on the west side
You say
“Breathe it in, breathe it out”
You don’t know what you’re talking about
And it’s eating away at my insides
And now I’m living on the west side
And my mother says I’ve gotten thin

And she held it down, so she got a Mercedes

They ran me ten thousand, I threw it like Brady
The foreign is yellow like Tracee and K.D
I trusted my niggas, they never betrayed me
Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me

213,Some Things Never Change,"[ANNA]
Yes, the wind blows a little bit colder
And we're all getting older
And the clouds are moving on with every autumn breeze
Peter Pumpkin just became fertilizer

[OLAF]
And my leaf’s a little sadder and wiser

[ANNA]
That's why I rely on certain certainties
Yes, some things never change
Like the feel of your hand in mine
Some things stay the same

[ANNA & OLAF]
Like how we get along just fine

[ANNA]
Like an old stone wall that'll never fall
Some things are always true
Some things never change
Like how I’m holding on tight to you

[KRISTOFF]
The leaves are already falling
Sven, it feels like the future is calling

(as Sven)
Are you telling me tonight you're gonna get down on one knee?

(as himself)
Yeah, but I'm really bad at planning these things out
Like candlelight and pulling of rings out

(as Sven)
Maybe you should leave all the romantic stuff to me

(as himself)
Yeah, some things never change
Like the love that I feel for her
Some things stay the same
Like how reindeers are easier
But if I commit and I go for it
I'll know what to say and do
Right?

(as Sven)
Some things never change

(as himself)
Sven, the pressure is all on you

[ELSA]
The winds are restless
Could that be why I'm hearing this call?
Is something coming?
I'm not sure I want things to change at all
These days are precious
Can't let them slip away
I can't freeze this moment
But I can still go out and seize this day

[CHOIR]
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
The wind blows a little bit colder

[OLAF]
And you all look a little bit older

[ANNA]
It’s time to count our blessings

[ANNA & KRISTOFF]
Beneath an autumn sky

[CHOIR]
We’re always living in kingdom aplenty
That stands for the good and the many

[ELSA]
And I promise you the flag of Arendelle will always fly

[ANNA]
Our flag will always fly

[CHOIR]
Our flag will always fly (Our flag will always fly)

[ALL]
Some things never change
Turn around and the time has flown
Some things stay the same
Though the future remains unknown
May our good luck last
May our past be past
Time's moving fast, it’s true
Some things never change

And I'm holding on tight to you

Yeah, we put corn in clips
How many times did we take them trips? (How many?)
I was walking around with the .38 spin
How many times did I take that risk?
How many times did they shoot and miss?
How many times did they touch civilians?
Then try rap and claim that shit (Packs)
How many lives have been taken? Shit (Shit den)
How many times have we taped off strips? (Bare times)
How many bells did I have in the chamber
And that pussyhole still got hit? (One)
How many mashes done got gripped?
How many times did we lurk with things?
How many times did I beg my friend again and again
To drop me that stick?
I got it and he saw what I did
Since then it's never left my hip
I put rambo blades in chests
I put flick knives straight in necks
With a wap, I'll aim for your head
If you see me then you're looking at death
Got 'em all scared, they're looking at their mates

And it's real talk, I don't need to pretend

Man can't talk about gang
Cah we've been around there bares
And I ain't gotta talk, we banged
These niggas, they're making me sick
How are they still posting vids they ain't on shit?
I remember it was Me, M and Shortz in the ride, two loaded sticks
Lucky that the ting there jammed (Fuck sake)
Same way it jammed on Prez
Shit den I blame that skeng cah that would've been two dead
Way before I hit mans head
They talk bout 7, it's 7 or nuthin
I ain't got love for the 6
They sneak diss, talking 'bout bitches

Where they play the right music, getting in the swing

Without you by my side
Or make it through one night
Alone, I lied
I said a lot of things
I didn't really mean
How can I make you see
What matters most to me?
Girl I should have known it
I couldn't last a moment without you

You've got every right
To turn and walk away
I can't make you stay

231,She's More,"I like blue eyes, hers are green
Not like the woman of my dreams
And her hair's not quite as long as I had planned
Five foot three isn't tall
She's not the girl I'd pictured at all
In those paint by number
Fantasies I've had

So it took me by complete suprise
When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes
She's not at all what I was lookin for, she's more

No, it wasn't at first sight
But the moment I looked twice
I saw the women I was born to love
Her laughter filled my soul
When I hold her I don't wanna let go
When it comes to her, I can't get enough

So it took me by complete suprise
When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes
She's not at all what I was lookin for, she's more!

More than I dreamed of
More than any man deserves...and I couldn't
Ask for a more than a love like hers

If he could only read her mind, she'd say

[Chorus]
Buy me a rose, call me from work
Open a door for me, what would it hurt
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things I need the most in my life

Now the days have grown to years of feeling all alone
And she can't help but wonder what she's doing wrong
Cause lately she'd try anything to turn his head
Would it make a difference if she said:

[Chorus]

And the more that he lives the less that he tries
To show her the love that he holds inside
And the more that she gives the more that he sees
This is a story of you and me

So I bought you a rose on the way home from work
To open the door to a heart that I hurt
And I hope you notice this look in my eyes
Cause I'm gonna make things right
For the rest of your life
I'm gonna hold you tonight
Do all those little things
For the rest of your life",Kenny Rogers,2000,"[91, 88, 84, 86, 82, 73, 66, 58, 54, 46, 40, 40, 43, 46, 46, 54, 65, 65, 72, 79]",20
233,What I Need To Do,"[Verse 1]
I keep telling myself this is the right thing to do
I was wasting her time, waiting on dreams that just weren't coming true
And this old highway seems to understand
Leading me on to somewhere that no one knows my name
I got the window rolled down, I got the radio up
I'm doing all that I can to get my mind off us

[Chorus]
What I need to do is turn this car around
Drive as fast as I can 'til I see the lights of our hometown
And run to her, take her in my arms
Make her see how sorry I am, well that shouldn't be so hard
But I drive on, and on, and on

[Verse 2]
Eighty-seven more miles gets me into Baton Rogue
There's a buddy of mine who says he might find some work that I can do
Or maybe head up north to Knoxville, Tennessee
I know my baby sister, has got a couch where I can sleep
Now the sun's going down on my broken heart
Lord, I got to get back before I get too far

[Chorus]
What I need to do is turn this car around
Drive as fast as I can 'til I see the lights of our hometown
And run to her, take her in my arms
Make her see how sorry I am, well that shouldn't be so hard
But I drive on
Yes I drive on, and on, and on

Since I stepped foot on my old stomping ground
I ended up by the old school yard
When this red head pulled up in a blue sports car
She said, ""I bet you don't remember, I guess it's been forever.""
It took a second to put it all together and I said

Ooh la la la la la
Looking good Carlene
Woh my my my my my

She said hop in let's go for a spin

Finally got a couple out on country radio
She said, ""What a switch, ain't life funny, I've got a PHD
Now I'm modeling for money.""

""Chad Butler, known as Pimp C, died in a Los Angeles hotel room...""
""The L.A. County Coroner’s office ruled the rapper's death accidental...""
""And attributed it to a combination of...""
""Apnea?""
""Yes.""
""...and syrup, and we know that syrup on the streets usually has codeine?""
""Absolutely, we have a problem now with the cough syrup epidemic...""

[Verse 1]
He rolled up, asked him what he was sipping on
He said lean, you want to hit it, dawg?
That's the same stuff Weezy's sipping huh
And tons of other rappers that be spitting hard
Yup, he had five up on
When he passed him that Styrofoam
The Easter pink, heard it in a rhyme before
Finally got to see what all the hype was on
And then he took a sip, sitting in the Lincoln
Thinking he was pimping as he listened to the system
Little did he know that it was just as addictive as base
Not the kind of hit from the kick drum
Hot box, let the bass bump
Take it to the face, gulp
Months later the use went up
Every blunt was accompanied by the pink stuff
But goddam, he loved that feeling
Purple rain coated in the throat, just so healing
Medicine alleviate the sickness
Liquid affix and it comes with a cost
Wake up, cold sweat, scratching, itching
Trying to escape the skin that barely fit him
Gone, get another bottle just to get a couple swallows
Headed towards the bottom couldn't get off it
Didn't even think he had a problem
Though he couldn't sleep without getting nauseous
Room spinning
Thinking he might of sipped just a little bit too much of that cough syrup
His eyelids closed shut
Sat back in the chair clutching that cup
Girlfriend came and a couple hours later
Said his name, shook him but he never got up

He never got up, he never got up
We live on the cusp of death thinking that it won't be us
It won't be us, it won't be us, it won't be us
Nah, it won't be us

[Verse 2]
Now he just wanted to act like them
He just wanted to rap like him
Us as rappers underestimate the power and the effects that we have on these kids
Blunt passed, ash in a tin
Pack being pushed, harassed by the Feds
The fact of it is most people that rap like this
Talking about some shit they haven't lived
Surprise, you know the drill
Trapped in a box, declining record sales
Follow the formula: violence, drugs, and sex sells
So we try to sound like someone else
This is not Californication
There's no way to glorify this pavement
Syrup, Percocet, and an eighth a day
Will leave you broke, depressed, and emotionally vacant
Despite how Lil Wayne lives
It's not conducive to being creative
And I know cause he's my favorite
And I know cause I was off that same mix
Rationalize the shit that I'd try after I listen to Dedication
But he's an alien
I'd sip that shit
Pass out or play PlayStation
Months later I'm in the same place
No music made, feeling like a failure
And trust me it's not dope to be twenty-five
And move back to your parent's basement
I've seen my people's dreams die
I've seen what they can be denied
And ""Weed's not a drug,"" that's denial
Groundhog Day, life repeat each time
I've seen Oxycontin take three lives
I grew up with them
We used to chief dimes
I've seen cocaine bring out the demons inside
Cheating and lying
Friendship cease, no peace in the mind
Stealing and taking anything to fix the pieces inside
Broken, hopeless, headed nowhere
Only motivation for what the dealer's supplying
That rush, that drug, that dope
Those pills, that crumb, that roach
Thinking I would never do that, not that drug
And growing up nobody ever does
Until you're stuck
Looking in the mirror like I can't believe what I've become
Swore I was going to be someone
And growing up everyone always does
We sell our dreams and our potential
To escape through that buzz
Just keep me up, keep me up
Hollywood, here we come

You can tend to, um, go a little too far with some of these things , they have very strong addictive qualities, pills and syrups and whatnot, so um…

Uhm—well, cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come, Erykah Badu-me—well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean

Make me say ""Nam Myoho Renge Kyo""
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual, make me believe in miracles
Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kickin' in gratuity

Friday night, tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat—somethin' pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second-class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury tastebuds
And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A-list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only got hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preaching to the choir
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky'd and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowin' the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em, really
I remember Amber told my boy
No matter what happens, she ain't goin' back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive need to put up some goddamn barricades
I be paranoid every time, the pressure
The problem ain't I be drivin', the problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby 'Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans, I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over; emcees, cancel your plans
A 38-year-old 8-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took six months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
Goddamn! Got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressin' like Cam
Thank God for me! (Los Angeles)
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neckful
Bitches say he fun-ny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop, like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money (Money, money, money)!
Big, big money (Money, money, money!)
And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em

I don't really say this that often
But there's somethin' that the papers forgot
Every time I read them, I know I feed them
But I know, they're painting, but they can't leave a mark
'Cause my friends don't read the papers
And they don't really care if we're awesome or not
So every time I read them, I know I feed them
But I know, they wanna see me hang on the wall

If you're lonely, don't you think you're on your own?
When it gets dark inside your head
Check my pulse, and if I'm there, you owe me

Say it to my face if you mean it
Say it to my face, but you won't
I know I'm not losin', but I'm losin' my mind

The life I lead
The average nigga would have broke down a long time ago
Try to bang in a show and get slumped like The Crow
Anyday now, we gonna run at my nigga them killas is Nathal
We see it all like night owls and we stay on the prowl
They don't wanna see me shine again
They fuckin' with my mind again
But as soon as I finish this Heineken
I gotta go get my nine again
(It got a body on it from a party don't it?)
Yeah I been tryin' to slang it, but don't nobody want it
They can't help you with band-aids, we comin' with grenades
You ain't seen this many niggas in your life with diamonds and braids
I'm from the home where they get sprayed and gang related raids
Fuck y'all, that start bangin' after ""Colors"" was made
Let's C-walk to that, and never give me no hassle
Cause I come from one of the worst cottage in Paso

It ain't no mystery you dissin' me you dissin' my clique
And ain't no question we come steppin' straight to get in your shit
So why you actin' like a bitch? Puttin' your business on wax
When we could scrap or slap a clip, if you wanted to crack
See in the pen we got a name for niggas runnin' they yap
Sale soldiers, roll 'em up with somethin' up in they back
Handles ours, battle scars, Shackles, guards and all
And we the last niggas standin' once they start to fall
Make the call, or fuck it, just kick off the brawl
Cuz I'm ridin' with my doggs, win, lose, or draw
Dogg pound: insane, neighborhood, twenty gangin' it
And every gangsta that I hang with down to bang
Full time pull mines and I gots to bust
Fuck a pass, when I mash, anybody get touched
So make my name taste just like a dick in your mouth
And watch the way you on my nuts when you spittin' it out

There was a man back in '95
Whose heart ran out of summers
But before he died, I asked him
Wait, what's the sense in life
Come over me, Come over me

Catch a Dylan song or some eclipse of the moon
Let an angel swing and make you swoon

Reason for the world...
Who am I?

There are secrets that we still have left to find
There have been mysteries from the beginning of time
There are answers we're not wise enough to see
He said you looking for a clue I love you free

The batter swings and the summer flies
As I look into my angel's eyes
A song plays on while the moon is high over me
Something comes over me

And that's what takes me high

I've been sitting here trying to find myself
I get behind myself I need to rewind myself
Looking for the payback listen for the playback
They say that every man bleeds just like me
And I feel like number one yet I'm last in line
I watch my youngest son and it helps to pass the time
I take too many pills that helps to ease the pain
I made a couple dollar bills still I feel the same
Everybody knows my name they say it way out loud
A lot of folks fuck with me it's hard to hang out in crowds
I guess that's the price you pay to be some big shot like I am
Outstretched hands and one night stands
Still I can't find love

[Chorus]
And when your walls come tumbling down
I will always be around
And when your walls come tumbling down
I will always be around

[Verse 2]
People don't know about the things I say and do
They don't understand about the shit I've been through
Its been so long since I've been home
I've been gone, I've been gone way too long
Maybe I've forgotten all the things I miss
Oh, somehow I know there's more to life than this
I've said it too many times and I still stand firm
You get what you put in and people get what they deserve
Still I ain't seen mine, no I ain't seen mine
I've been givin', just ain't been gettin'
I've been walkin' that there line
So I think I'll keep walking with my head held high
I keep moving on and only God knows why

And so we talked all night about the rest of our lives
Where we're gonna be when we turn 25
Keep thinking times will never change
Keep on thinking things will always be the same (Be the same)
But when we leave this year we won't be coming back
No more hanging out cause we're on a different track
And if you got something that you need to say
You better say it right now cause you don't have another day (Another day)
'Cause we're moving on and we can't slow down
These memories are playing like a film without sound
And I keep thinking of that night in June
I didn't know much of love, but it came too soon (Came too soon)
And there was me and you, and then we got real blue
Stay at home talking on the telephone with me
We'd get so excited, we'd get so scared
Laughing at ourselves thinking life's not fair
And this is how it feels

As we go on
We remember
All the times we
Had together
And as our lives change
Come whatever
We will still be

[Verse 2]
So if we get the big jobs, and we make the big money
When we look back now, will our jokes still be funny?
Will we still remember everything we learned in school?
Still be trying to break every single rule (Every rule)
Will little brainy Bobby be the stockbroker man?
Can Heather find a job that won't interfere with a tan?
I keep, I keep thinking that it's not goodbye (Goodbye)
Keep on thinking it's a time to fly

Had together

[Verse 3]
Will we think about tomorrow like we think about now?
Can we survive it out there?
Can we make it somehow? (Somehow)
I guess I thought that this would never end
And suddenly, it's like we're women and men
Will the past be a shadow that will follow us 'round?
Will these memories fade when I leave this town?
I keep, I keep thinking that it's not goodbye (It's not goodbye)
Keep on thinking it's a time to fly

Spraying then hide away in the shade of his maimed innocence
Suitcase scented with haze and filetted sentences
Advanced apathy, smashing the man cameras up

Rapping hot as fucking cattle brands wearing flannel thongs
Grab a bong, mama and some food, beer, tag along

Or a swift fist off your chin from his wrist-launcher

Stormed off and came straight back like pigs' posture
Pen? Naw, probably written with some used syringes
From out the rubbish bin at your local loony clinic
Watching movies in a room full of goons he rented
On the hunt for clues, more food, and some floozy women
Bruising gimmicks with the broom he usually use for Quidditch
Gooey writtens, scoot 'em to a ditch, chewed and booty-scented
Too pretentious, do pretend like he could lose with spitting
Steaming tubes of poop and twisted doobies full of euphemisms
Stupid, thought it up, jot it quick 
Thaw it out, toss it right back like a vodka fifth
Spot him on a rocket swapping dollars in for pocket lint
Then lob a wad of chicken at a copper on some Flocka shit

249,Goodbye Earl,"[Verse 1]
Mary Anne and Wanda were the best of friends
All through their high school days
Both members of the 4H Club
Both active in the FFA
After graduation Mary Anne went out
Lookin' for a bright new world
Wanda looked all around this town
And all she found was Earl

[Verse 2]
Well it wasn't two weeks after she got married
That Wanda started gettin' abused
She put on dark glasses and long sleeved blouses
And makeup to cover a bruise
Well she finally got the nerve to file for divorce
She let the law take it from there
But Earl walked right through that restraining order
And put her in intensive care

[Pre-Chorus]
Right away, Mary Anne flew in from Atlanta
On a red-eye midnight flight
She held Wanda's hand and they worked out a plan
And it didn't take 'em long to decide

[Chorus]
That Earl had to die
Goodbye, Earl
Those black-eyed peas
They tasted all right to me, Earl
You're feeling weak
Why don't you lay down and sleep, Earl?
Ain't it dark
Wrapped up in that tarp, Earl?

[Verse 3]
The cops came by to bring Earl in
They searched the house high and low
Then they tipped their hats
And said ""Thank You ladies, if you hear from him let us know""

[Verse 4]
Well the weeks went by and
Spring turned to summer
And summer faded into fall
And it turns out he was a missing person
Who nobody missed at all

[Pre-Chorus]
So the girls bought some land at a roadside stand
Out on Highway 109
They sell Tennessee ham
And strawberry jam
And they don't lose any sleep at night, 'cause...

[Chorus]
Earl had to die
Goodbye Earl
We need a break
Let's go out to the lake, Earl
We'll pack a lunch
And stuff you in the trunk, Earl

When this woman came through with about 25 things
And I said don't you know that more is less
She said this world is moving so fast
I just get more behind with every day
And every morning when I make my coffee
I can't believe my life's turned out this way
All I could say was

Love's the only house
Big enough for all the pain in the world
Love's the only house
Big enough for all the pain

He was walking by the other day and I said
Hey baby, how you've been
Yeah I got me a little girl now and she's 4 years old
And she's got her daddy's little grin
And you only wanted what you can't have
And baby you can't have me now
I gave my heart to another
Yeah I'm a mother and he's a father and we're a family and we got each other
And I found out the hard way that

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You drive three miles from all this prosperity
Down across the river and you see a ghetto there
And we got children walking around with guns
And they got knives and drugs and pain to spare
And here I am in my clean white shirt
With a little money in my pocket and a nice warm home
And we got teenagers walking around in a culture of darkness
Living together alone, all I can say is

And I can't explain it and I can't understand
But I'll come down and get my hands dirty
And together we'll make a stand

City streets are going burn if we don't do something soon
And señorita can't quit crying
Baby's due now any day

No one there to show him the way
She came down to the grocery store
And she said I want to buy a little carton of milk
But I don't have any money

Yeah the pain's got to go someplace

Anything of his own

Who's kidding?

A one way ticket headstone
Occupations overthrown
Whisper through a megaphone

It's nothing as it seems
The little that he needs
It's home
The little that he sees
Is nothing he concedes
It's home

Dances on your perfect skin

So she don't know if she comin' or goin'
'Cause mami, after I'm cummin', I'm goin'
Back to the show, just frontin' and flowin'
Jewelry stuntin' and glowin', this life is somethin', I know it
And I been known to have a ho or two
'Cause my diamonds yellow like a smoker tooth
I tell 'em step into the vocal booth
Roll a joint, smoke a few, after that I'm pokin' you
After that, it's over, boo, baby, grab your coat and voom

[Chorus]
I need to know, you down to do whatever?
Down to get it poppin'? Down to get topless? Ohh
I need to know if you about cuttin'
Or you about frontin', baby, I need to know

[Verse 3]
Now there's three different levels to relationships
Pollyin' at the club with 'em, talkin', gettin' affectionate
Leavin' and havin' sex with 'em, kickin' 'em out
Trickin' on models, dimes and rats
Now I don't get into that, I kick that habit
I just keep 'em impressed, let 'em seat in the Lex
Never eat 'em unless that fuckin' cat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket, I'm lyin'
I got a nine in my pants and baby, I'm just dyin' for a chance
Who ready to fuck? You ready to fuck off the sizzurp?
Says she ready to cut, then she grabs my scissors
She probably look good, but what's scary to me
Henny make hoes look like Halle Berry to me

[Chorus]
I need to know, you down to do whatever?
Down to get it poppin'? Down to get topless? Ohh

261,How Do You Like Me Now?!,"[Verse 1]
I was always the crazy one
I broke into the stadium
And I wrote your number on the 50 yard line
You were always the perfect one
And the valedictorian so
Under your number I wrote ""Call for a good time""
I only wanted to catch your attention
But you overlooked me somehow
Besides you had too many boyfriends to mention
And I played my guitar too loud

[Chorus]
How do you like me now?
How do you like me now
Now that I'm on my way?
Do you still think I'm crazy
Standing here today?
I couldn’t make you love me
But I always dreamed about living in your radio
How do you like me now?

[Verse 2]
When I took off to Tennessee
I heard that you made fun of me
Never imagined I'd make it this far
Then you married into money girl
Ain't it a cruel and funny world?
He took your dreams and tore them apart
He never comes home
And you’re always alone
And your kids hear you crying down the hall
Alarm clock starts ringing
Who could that be singing
Its me baby, with your wakeup call!

[Chorus]
How do you like me now?
How do you like me now
Now that I'm on my way?
Do you still think I'm crazy
Standing here today?
I couldn’t make you love me
But I always dreamed about living in your radio
How do you like me now?

262,The Best Day,"[Verse 1]
I had a rough day, but that's life, it happens
Woke up on a dark side of my mattress
I guess I forgot to set my clock
Overslept, almost lost the job
Then to top it off, I'm kinda hungry
But can't eat till I find my money
It's in my wallet but my wallet ain't in my pocket
Can't remember the last time I saw it
And they don't want me in a bad mood
Afraid that it'll spread and everyone will catch an attitude
They got 'em all singing the same tune
Thinking I should go and start a fire in the break room
Co-workers make me sick
And the manager really ain't shit
But I can't quit, so I'm hiding in the basement
Holding onto to my face like fuck this place

[Hook]
Every day can't be the best day
Do what you can right now, don't hesitate
That's why we try to make love and get paid
Take the bad with the good, now let's play
Every day can't be the best day
Do what you can right now, don't hesitate
That's why we try to make love and get paid
Take the bad with the good, now let's play

[Verse 2]
Hell naw, I ain't going to school
The teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
And all the kids mess with each other always all day
Class warfare up and down the hallways
And if you ain't popular
Nobody talks to ya, unless they mocking ya
Not even bus driver or the hall monitor
I might as well climb inside my locker huh
It's a bad day, bad week and a bad month
Don't nobody want to trade with my bag lunch
Someday I'mma be so cool
But for now I got cheap shoes, so I keep losing
Girls give no love to a poor man
It's a prison, the clock is warden
Man it won't get no better when I get home
So I listen to the voice in my headphones

[Hook]
Every day can't be the best day
Do what you can right now, don't hesitate
That's why we try to make love and get paid

Do what you can right now, don't hesitate
That's why we try to make love and get paid
Take the bad with the good, now let's play

[Verse 3]
Can't dance with an upset stomach
The overdraft notices just kept coming
Somebody broke into the porch and stole a chair
Top of your head stopped growing hair
Broken glass, computer crashed
The car won't start and the tires went flat
Dog got loose, brought back a dead cat
Daughter found it and had a panic attack
Plus you ain't had sex in how long?
Afraid to admit that the fire's all gone
The better half is talking about separate
You wish you could take it back to yesterday
You not alone, it's hard as hell
But don't waste no time feeling sorry for self
We'll be right here with you through your war
Cause you're the one that we make this music for
Now turn it up

Every day can't be the best day
Do what you can right now, don't hesitate

Don't be that way
Fall apart twice a day

Show, never tell
But I know you too well
Got a mood that you wish you could sell

I don't wanna be you...

""Never look back,"" we said
How was I to know I'd miss you so?
Loneliness up ahead, emptiness behind
Where do I go?
And you didn't hear
All my joy through my tears
All my hopes through my fears
Did you know still I miss you somehow?

[Chorus]
From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love, you were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love
I never knew love 'til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart

[Verse 2]
""Baby,"" I said, ""Please stay
Give our love a chance for one more day""
We could've worked things out
Taking time is what love's all about
But you put a dart
Through my dreams, through my heart
And I'm back where I started again
Never thought it would end

From the bottom of my broken heart (My broken heart)
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know

You promised yourself
But to somebody else
And you made it so perfectly clear
Still I wish you were here

With no cheese, no deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys
No boats, no snowmobiles and no skis
Mad at me ‘cause I can finally afford
To provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio
And it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze?
Ho, please!
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?
Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C.'s
The Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said, ""Motherfuck the police!""
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales weren't doin' too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop
Or The Firm flopped
Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin' no sleep
So fuck y'all, all of y'all!
If y'all don't like me, blow me!
Y'all are gon' keep fuckin' around with me
And turn me back to the old me

So what do you say to somebody you hate (What?)
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way? (Yup)
Just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walkin' by
With a Walkman on, when I caught a guy
Gave me an awkward eye ('Chu lookin' at?)
And strangled him up in the parking lot with his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hoppin' out with two broken legs
Tryna walk it off
Fuck you too, bitch! Call the cops!
I'ma kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt-down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out (Right here!)
So from here on out, it's the Chronic II
Startin' today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough
To choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
Chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady
Hotter than a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid-80s
Callin' men ladies

But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me
Like it was some disease, but you won't get a crumb from me
‘Cause I'm from the streets of C-Compton! (Compton!)
I told 'em all
All 'em little gangstas, who you think helped mold 'em all?
Now you wanna run around talkin' 'bout guns like I ain't got none
What, you think I sold 'em all
‘Cause I stay well off?
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off
What, ‘cause I been in the lab
With a pen and a pad tryin' to get this damn label off?
I ain't havin' that
This is the millennium of Aftermath
It ain't gon' be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque
And fuck rap, you can have it back

While you were cuddlin' a Cabbage Patch

Do you believe in love at first sight

Believe me
That's a big relief
Well, this place is awful crowded
And this music is so loud
Would you like to go and grab a bite to eat

It's nice to finally meet a girl who doesn't move too fast
I was only checking, that's the reason that I asked
Relationships need time to grow
You and I should take this slow

271,This Time Around,"[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
This time around I never get bit
Though you really want to fix me
This time around you're making me sick
Though you really want to get me
Somebody's out, somebody's out to get me
You really want to fix me, hit me
But this time around I'm taking no shit
Though you really want to get me, you really want to get me

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
This time around I'm not going to get bit
Though you really want to get me
But this time around I'm taking no shit
Though you really want to fix me
Somebody's out, somebody's out to use me
You really want to use me and falsely accuse me
This time around don't treat me like spit
Though you really can't control me

[Chorus]
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me

He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Listen, I got problems of my own
Flashing cameras, taps on my phone
Even in my home, I ain’t safe as I should be
Things always missing, maybe it could be
My friends, but they ain’t friends if they robbing me
Stopping me, from making a profit, see
Apology shallow like the ocean
I guess I'll resort to gun-totin'
If I was dead broke and smoking
I'd probably be by my lonesome
I'ma kill a nigga, I ain’t joking
Indo smoke got me choking, I'm hoping
A fool come slipping, so I can blow him open
This time around I changed up my flow
Got rid of the Rotts, got Pits by the door
A real set of peoples to watch my back
Stay away from strangers so I won't slack
And I know my nigga Mike like that
Baby

[Chorus]
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me

272,The Bad Touch,"[Intro]
Ha-Ha! Well now, we call this the act of mating
But there are several other very important differences
Between human beings and animals that you should know about

(I'd appreciate your input)

[Verse 1]
Sweat baby, sweat baby, sex is a Texas drought
Me and you do the kind of stuff that only Prince would sing about
So put your hands down my pants and I'll bet you'll feel nuts
Yes, I'm Siskel, yes, I'm Ebert and you're getting two thumbs up
You've had enough of two-hand touch, you want it rough, you're out of bounds
I want you smothered, want you covered, like my Waffle House hash browns
Come quicker than FedEx, never reach an apex, just like Coca-Cola stock, you are inclined
To make me rise an hour early, just like Daylight Savings Time

[Chorus]
Do it now
You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals
So, let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
Do it again now
You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals
So, let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
Getting horny now

[Verse 2]
Love, the kind you clean up with a mop and bucket
Like the lost catacombs of Egypt, only God knows where we stuck it
Hieroglyphics, let me be Pacific: I wanna be down in your South Seas
But I got this notion that the motion of your ocean means ""Small Craft Advisory""
So, if I capsize on your thighs high tide, B-5, you sunk my battleship
Please turn me on, I'm Mister Coffee with an automatic drip
So show me yours, I'll show you mine, ""Tool Time,"" you'll Lovett just like Lyle
And then we'll do it doggy style so we can both watch ""X-Files""

[Chorus]
Do it now
You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals

Do it again now

Looking as fine as can be
In your fancy car
I can see you looking at me
What you wanna do?
Are you just gonna sit there and stare?
Baby, talk to me
Tell me what's on your mind
Baby, oh

Oh, baby
Bring it all to me (Bring it all)

[Verse 2: J.C. Chasez]
Baby, what's the deal?
Would I be too forward if
I told you how I feel
That's just the way I do my thing
I'm so for real
Are you feeling my Timb's, my baggy jeans?
My thug appeal?
Do you like it when a man can keep it real?
Oh

Oh, baby
Bring it all to me (bring it all, bring it all)

Oh, I'll put my pride to the side
Just to tell you how good
You make me feel inside

That we can't make this right

What a girl wants, what a girl needs

But you had faith strong enough
To move over and give me space

If it comes back, it's yours and that's how you know
It's for keeps, yeah, it's for sure

286,Real Live Woman,"I don't buy the lines in magazines
That tell me what I've gotta be
I don't base my life on a movie screen
I don't fit the mold society has planned
I don't need to be 19 years old
Or starve myself for some weight I'm told
Or turn men's heads down that road
And I thank God I finally know just who I am

I ain't a movie star
May never see the view from where they are
And this old town may be as far as I'm goin'
And what he'll hold tonight in his hands
He swears there's so much better than
Anything that this old world can show him

I'm a real live woman
In love with this man I see lyin' here next to me
Lost in the way that he's holdin'
This real live woman
In the arms of a man where I'll fall asleep
Knowin' there's nothin' on earth he loves more than
This real live woman

I work 9-5 and I can't relate
To millionaires who somehow fate
Has smiled upon and fortune made their
Common lives a better place to be
And I no longer justify
Reasons for the way that I behave
I offer no apologies
For the things that I believe and say
And I like it that way

'Cause I'm a real live woman
In love with this man I see lyin' here next to me
Lost in the way that he's holdin'

The undertow and the waves
The water is mischievous, ha!
I like how it misbehaves
The village may think I'm crazy
Or say that I drift too far
But once you know what you like
Well there you are

You are your father's daughter

Mind what he says but remember
You may hear a voice inside
And if the voice starts to whisper
To follow the farthest star
Moana, that voice inside
Is who you are

Future together

Cause every path
Leads you back to

You can find happiness right

Love gets tainted and all seems the same
I guess it's unbelievable
Someone could love you like this
Well time ain't no object and money ain't a thing

Be your stars and your moon
I wanna be your sunny day
Can I be your favorite tune?
I wanna be your breakfast in bed

Yes sir, hmm
You've been hurt so many times
You don't know when love's for real
So you don't open up

I take it easy
Girl I'm gonna wait
Cause lovin' just ain't right
Without you by my side
Baby you're my soul mate
Baby I'll open doors
Be there for you any time
Cause that's what your man's supposed to do
Baby I wanna cook for you
I will spoil you
Girl my whole objective is to please you
I'll run your bubble bath
Make you laugh
Girl through thick and thin Ive got your back

[Intro]
Break 'em
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Uh

[Verse 1]
Just wakin' up in the morning, gotta thank God
I don't know, but today seems kinda odd
No barking from the dog, no smog
And Momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the door
Thinkin', ""Will I live another twenty-four?""
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop-top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Lookin' in my mirror and not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all
""Which park are y'all playin' basketball?""
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week, fucked around and got a triple double
Freakin' niggas every way, like MJ
I can't believe today was a good day

[Verse 2]
Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
'Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of niggas
And watch me break 'em with the 7, 7-11, 7-11
7, even back door Little Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin': ""Domino!""
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central LA
Today was a good day

[Verse 3]
Left my nigga's house paid
Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
And my dick runs deep, so deep
So deep put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'
Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams
No helicopter lookin' for a murder
Two in the morning, got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read ""Ice Cube's a Pimp"" (Yeah)
Drunk as hell, but no throwin' up
Halfway home and my pager still blowin' up
Today I didn't even have to use my AK
I gotta say, it was a good day

Tell me why you don’t love me
Why you always misjudge me?
Why you always put so many things above me?
Why you lead me to believe that I’m ugly?
Why you never trust me?
Why you treat me like I don’t matter?
Why you always kicking my ladder?
Why you never hearing my side to the story?
Never look me in my eyes, say sorry?

Why you can't recognize my stride?
Always gotta minimize my pride
Always gon' criticize my moods
I can't make one mistake, it's no room
Feelin' like I gotta leave real soon
I'ma say, ""Namaste,"" and just bloom
But for now, let you run away from the truths
Since you can do anything you want to, anyway, uh
Know some things I ain't supposed to know
It's way deeper than just bein' emotional
Some things you just couldn't keep on the low
Now I'm free, by the truth, I can't be controlled, no more
Nothin' like I used to be back before
Know it must hurt for you to see me evolve
Why you gotta kick me down on all fours?
Why you can't stand to see me stand tall?
Tell me why we got a war?
Why we gotta fight? Why we always gotta spar for?
Why the cops always gotta get called?
Why you always tryna see me in trouble with the law?
I guess some things will never change
Locked in the cycle, tryna break the chains
Handcuffs so tight, nearly slit my veins
This what tough love feels like, feel my pain, uh

[Chorus]
Tell me why you don’t love me
Why you always misjudge me?
Why you always put so many things above me?
Why you lead me to believe that I’m ugly?
Why you never trust me?
Why you treat me like I don’t matter?
Why you always kicking my ladder?
Why you never hearing my side to the story?
Never look me in my eyes, say sorry?

I would really take you back
Let you back in my heart one more time

That there'd be more feeling there
Did you think you could walk back in my life
So you found you miss the love you threw away
Baby but you found it out too late. Too Late

I remember cold nights
Tears I thought would never dry
How you shattered my world
With your goodbye.Your goodbye baby
Would've sold my soul then
Just to have you back again
Now you're the last thing on my mind
Now you say you're sorry and
You've changed your ways
Sorry but you changed your ways too late

Drinkin' Ace of Spades like it's codeine now

Push through the pain so we can see new life
So all the ladies havin' babies, see ya sacrifice
Mama had four kids, but she's a lesbian
Had to pretend so long that she's a thespian
Had to hide in the closet, so she medicate
Society shame and the pain was too much to take
Cried tears of joy when you fell in love
Don't matter to me if it's a him or her
I just wanna see you smile through all the hate
Marie Antoinette, baby, let 'em eat cake

Now the whole projects on my jet
Now you see the real in the front row

How niggas can't relate?
Fuck a slice of the apple pie, want my own cake
In charge of my own fate, respect Jimmy Iovine
But he gotta respect the Elohim as a whole new regime
And niggas playin' for power, huh
So our music is ours, niggas own their own houses
Ours was, ""Fuck you, pay me""
Now it's, ""Fuck payin' me, I pay you
Put the rest away for Blue""
That blood money I giggle at it
Can't even support my miss' habit
Jewelry shoppin' in Pa- all ya jewelers should be embarrassed
Huh, blood diamonds drippin' with guilt, I still ain't trippin'
That's life, winners and losers
Drug dealers and abusers, America likes me ruthless
My therapist said I relapsed
I said, ""Pre-haps I Freudian slipped in European whips""
God sent me to break the chain, I'm the true and livin'
God in the flesh, the rest of these niggas is vain
A stain on the white suit, inferior IQ
Niggas'll rip your shit off TIDAL just to spite you
Ahhhh, what did I do? 'Cept try to free you
Niggas'll love you but hate you 'cause they can't be you
Dump 'em all in the bayou, uh
Everybody wave bye to the guy you thought you could lie to
This was meant to be a haiku, huh
But my story's too wide to fit inside the line or two
Oh, these that drugs, heron flow, I spaz on the stove
This is Hov, no flex zone, nigga, who lied to you?
Look, you a pedestrian, don't ever question the security I provided you
Oh y'all thought I was washed? I'm at the cleaners
Launderin' dirty money like the Teamsters, huh
Shout out to Hoffa back home, he in the church
When I heard you got booked, that shit hurt
Feel for you bro, we know the system don't work
Take a young nigga freedom over some dirt
Yet it's legal in Colorado, yet, we deny
Black entrepreneurs, free enterprise
That's why it's a black market, that's why it's called the trap
That's why it's called the projects 'cause it's exactly that
All these people was gon' kill me, heh
'Cause the more I reveal me, the more they 'fraid of the real me
Welcome back Carter, smile

[Outro: Gloria Carter]
Living in the shadow
Can you imagine what kind of life it is to live?
In the shadows people see you as happy and free
Because that's what you want them to see
Living two lives, happy, but not free
You live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or the person you love
The world is changing and they say it's time to be free
But you live with the fear of just being me
Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be
No harm for them, no harm for me
But life is short, and it's time to be free
Love who you love, because life isn't guaranteed

294,If You Don't Wanna Love Me,"[Verse 1]
Stopped by to see you
Just the other day
And I wanna say
That I finally realized
The words ""I love you"" don't mean a thing
It's so hard for me to see
That you meant everything to me
But I guess I gotta move on
Even though it hurts I gotta be strong

[Chorus]
If you don't wanna love me, don't love me
Don't wanna touch me, don't touch me
'Cause I don't want you to do anything
That you don't wanna do
If you don't wanna miss me, don't miss me
Don't wanna kiss me, don't kiss me
'Cause I don't want you to do anything
That you don't wanna do, no

[Verse 2]
Who would have known
All the nights that you were hanging late
All alone I'd lay awake in my bed
While someone else was putting food on your plate
I refuse to believe
That you never ever loved me
I've gotta move on, our love is gone
And this house is not a home, no

[Chorus]
If you don't wanna love me, don't love me
Don't wanna touch me, don't touch me
'Cause I don't want you to do anything
That you don't wanna do
If you don't wanna miss me, don't miss me
Don't wanna kiss me, don't kiss me
'Cause I don't want you to do anything
That you don't wanna do, no

[Bridge]
You can be lonely
I don't even care
But you didn't have to make me think that
You'll always be there
You said you'd be right there
So if you don't...

[Chorus]
If you don't wanna love me, don't love me
Don't wanna touch me, don't touch me
'Cause I don't want you to do anything
That you don't wanna do
If you don't wanna miss me, don't miss me
Don't wanna kiss me, don't kiss me
'Cause I don't want you to do anything
That you don't wanna do, no

If you don't wanna love me, don't love me
Don't wanna touch me, don't touch me

When you didn't have to
For that I love you

I'm bout to string a bitch out like a ukulele
I'm puffin purp with vitamins and enzymes
So how I drift in the breeze like some wind chimes
Cruise with the kid where the climate is tropical
To the pad, we gotta go, on the coast of Galapagos

Backseat position, just ya friends and me
I will keep the confidentiality
Because I like your body, voice, and personality
You got style, you got grace
You got a size 5 size 6 waist
You gotta go hard, and not against
You make something get hard in my pants
Are you my love, are you my lust
Or are you just a quick nut to bust
Could you be my nina, my girl, my buttercup?
Are you gon' mess with me when the sun come up?

Until you saved my life

See all I know is that my girlfriend used to date you
How would you feel if she held you down and raped you?
Tried and tried, but she never could escape you
She was in love and I'd ask her how, I mean why?
What kind of love from a nigga would black your eye?
What kind of love from a nigga every night make you cry?
What kind of love from a nigga make you wish he would die?
I mean, shit, he bought you things and gave you diamond rings
But them things wasn't worth none of the pain that he brings
And you stayed, what made you fall for him?
That nigga had the power to make you crawl for him
I thought you was a doctor, be on call for him
Smacked you down 'cause he said you was too tall for him, huh
That wasn't love, baby girl, you was dreamin'
I could have killed you when you said your seed was growin' from his semen

Love is blind, and it will take over your mind

You need to elevate and find
Love is blind, and it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find

[Verse 2]
I don't even know you and I'd kill you myself
You played with her like a doll and put her back on the shelf
Wouldn't let her go to school and better herself
She had a baby by your ass and you ain't giving no help
Uh-huh, big time hustler, snake motherfucker
One's born every day and every day she was your sucker
How could you beat the mother of your kids?
How could you tell her that you love her, but don't give a fuck if she lives?
She told me she would leave you, I admit it she did
But came back, made up a lie about you missing your kids
Sweet kisses, baby ain't even know she was your mistress
Had to deal with fist fights and phone calls from your bitches
Floss like you possessed her, tellin' me to mind my business
Said that it was her life and stay the fuck out of it
I tried and said just for him I'll keep a ready clip

[Chorus]
Love is blind, and it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find
Love is blind, and it will take over your mind
What you think is love, is truly not
You need to elevate and find

[Verse 3]
I don't even know you and I want you dead
Don't know the facts but I saw the blood pour from her head
See I laid down beside her in the hospital bed
And about two hours later, doctors said she was dead
Had the nerve to show up at her mother's house the next day
To come and pay your respects and help the family pray
Even knelt down on one knee and let a tear drop
And before you had a chance to get up, you heard my gun cock
Prayin' to me now, I ain't God but I'll pretend
I ain't start your life but nigga, I'ma bring it to an end
And I did, clear shots and no regrets, never
Cops comin' lock me under the jail
Nigga, whatever my bitch, fuck it, my sister
You could never figure out even if I let you live
What our love was all about
I considered her my blood and it don't come no thicker

Yuh, yo
I'm on that homicide, suicide, drama like Islamabad
Under God, goin' overboard like the Amistad
Ringin' bells, it was 2012 back in ‘95
I made it out alive, now, finally, I've arrived
But still threw back to all my other blue black
People that's stickin' to it like mice to a glue trap
My work speak for itself, so I don't interrupt
I am an expert, this is no beginner's luck
If you denyin' the truth, then I don't give a fuck
Otherwise, get your hands and your antennas up
As we go into our initial decent, I'm alive, but only fifty percent
I’m prayin' God give me the strength

[Chorus: Main Event West]
It’s like somebody turned on the light (Turned on the light)
It’s like somebody started a fire and I feel so alive

I know that you've changed my whole life
And if I know there’s one thing that’s the truth
I know I’d be lost if I lost you

They say tomorrow’s not promised today
But today I promise if we don’t make our own way, somebody’ll take it from us
Snatch it like rats to cheese
So, Lord, help me please 'cause I rather die on my feet than to live on my knees
Living like I’m bulletproof
Cockin' the Glock and aim and shoot
My future’s ever clear, a 180 proof
So I open the bottle then swallow my pride and drink the pain away
I take shots and just lay up then fade away
Dreamin' of better days, dreamin' of better pay
But we got our work cut out for us, so we better pray
Pray to uphold the weak, not for eternal sleep
But if I die, I pray the Lord my soul to keep

[Chorus: Main Event West]
It’s like somebody turned on the light (Turned on the light)
It’s like somebody started a fire and I feel so alive
Finally, I’ve realized that I don't have to tell myself twice
I know that you've changed my whole life
And if I know there’s one thing that’s the truth
I know I’d be lost if I lost you

304,American Pie,"[Verse 1]
A long, long time ago...
I can still remember
How that music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And, maybe, they’d be happy for a while
But February made me shiver
With every paper I’d deliver
Bad news on the doorstep;
I couldn’t take one more step
I can’t remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died

[Chorus]
So bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
Singing, ""This’ll be the day that I die
""This’ll be the day that I die.""

[Verse 2]
Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock ’n' roll
Can music save your mortal soul
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?
Well, I know that you’re in love with him
`Cause I saw you dancin’ in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues
I was a lonely teenage broncin’ buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singing

[Chorus]
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
Singing, ""This’ll be the day that I die
""This’ll be the day that I die.""

[Verse 3]
Now for ten years we’ve been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rollin’ stone
But that’s not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me
Oh, and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned;
No verdict was returned
And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singing

[Chorus]
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
Singing, ""This’ll be the day that I die
""This’ll be the day that I die.""

[Verse 4]
Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast
It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast
Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While the sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance!
`Cause the players tried to take the field;
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singing

[Chorus]
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
Singing, ""This’ll be the day that I die
""This’ll be the day that I die.""

[Verse 5]
Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So come on: Jack be nimble, Jack be quick!
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil’s only friend
Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in hell
Could break that Satan’s spell
And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
We were singing

[Chorus]
Bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
Singing, ""This’ll be the day that I die
""This’ll be the day that I die.""

[Verse 6]
I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store
Where I’d heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn’t play
And in the streets: the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken;
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire most:
The father, son, and the holy ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

[Deleted Verse]
And there I stood alone and afraid
I dropped to my knees and there I prayed
And I promised him everything I could give
If only he would make the music live
And he promised it would live once more
But this time one would equal four
And in five years four had come to mourn
And the music was reborn

[Chorus]
Bye-bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye
Singing, ""This’ll be the day that I die
""This’ll be the day that I die.""
They were singing
Bye-bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry

I need to talk to you for a minute
I can't keep playin' myself like this
There's only one thing I wanna know
Should I stay, or should I go?

It's not my fault that you made yourself a regretful past
But all I know is it makes me look bad
When I'm holding your hand and you see old friends you knew
And they walk away laughing calling me a fool

Now baby I can't change the things you did before we met
Even though I didn't know you
But it's hard for me to trust you even though girl I love you

But you gave your attention to someone across the room

But I couldn't see it 'cause love had me so blind

And I can't take no more from you, yeah

314,Private Emotion,"[Verse 1]
Every endless night has a dawning day
Every darkest sky has a shining ray
And it shines on you baby can't you see
You're the only one who can shine for me

[Chorus]
It's a private emotion that fills you tonight
And a silence falls between us
As the shadows steal the light
And wherever you may find it
Wherever it may lead
Let's your private emotion come to me
Come to me come to me
Come to me

[Verse 2]
When your soul is tired and your heart is weak
Do you think of love as one way street
Well it runs both ways, open up your eyes
Can't you see me here, how can you deny ooh

[Chorus]
It's a private emotion that fills you tonight
And a silence falls between us
As the shadows steal the light
And wherever you may find it
Wherever it may lead
Lets your private emotion come to me
Come to me come to me

[Verse 3]
Every endless night has a dawning day
Every darkest sky has a shining ray
It takes a lot to laugh as your tears go by
But you can find me here till your tears run dry

[Chorus]
It's a private emotion that fills you tonight
And a silence falls between us
As the shadows steal the light
And wherever you may find it
Wherever it may lead
Lets your private emotion come to me
Lets your private emotion come to me
Lets your private emotion come to me
Come to me come to me",Ricky Martin,2000,"[89, 78, 71, 67, 76]",5

Ah, yeah...
Uh huh...

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Ain't it amazing how crazy the hood done made me
Feels like my emotions are froze
(I stay G'd up)
It's the things I done seen and the shit I been through
That make my heart turn cold
(I stay G'd up)
I'm a gangsta you find out for sure if you ever step on my toes
(I stay G'd up)
When I'm hanging out that window with that AK filling your punk ass with holes
(I stay G'd up)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Cocaine, heroin, ecstasy, marijuana
I'm mule on that Greyhound from NY to the Carolina
Paper chase, different name, same face, don't catch a case
My road dog's on parole, his baby girl's four years old
We play the block, pistol cocked, you could shoot or get shot
Kill you for your crack spot take everything your ass got
Semi-automatic spray, bust back or run away
Niggas talkin in the hood we'll handle this another day
In November you make my shitlist you did you can cancel Christmas
I'll send you a gift, niggas'll come and leave your ass twisted
Them hollow tip shells burn baby burn
See a nigga get merked, a baby's born, man the world turns
I seen it all crystal clear so I keep my pistol near
Heart's never full of fear, homie I stay well aware
Of what's going on around me, motherfuckers want me dead
I go with a smile on my face when it's my time kid

[Chorus: 50 Cent]

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Lil niggas I done paved the way, y'all should thank him
But if you think otherwise
Bring your boy over here so I can spank him
I'll put an end to your career, BITCH
Before you speak on 50; buy a .40 and a spare clip
These niggas gassed up, gettin to used to rap
Like I won't give 'em more bloodclots than Supercat
Niggas'll SNATCH YA, I'm like a back catcher
I'll give a sign, and then throw something at cha
Round here niggas die off hydro
And even when it ain't 4th of July it sound like pyro
You smart enough to creep and lay your dumb brains down
The pound'll spin you around like the young James Brown
I know I'm hot but hey, I'm icy too
Rocks'll hit you from a block away like a beat from Dr. Dre
We're taking over this year, K's and the soldiers is here
Everyone knows it's a scare, YEAH

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Ain't it amazing how crazy the hood done made me

[Verse 3: Young Buck]
My papa never bothered to show me what it was to be a man
He'd just pop another bottle and smoke up a half a gram
I would hop in my Impala and ride all through the night
They gave my homeboy life so when you do it, do it right
My fingernails still filled with cocaine residue
I still got the heart to go and bust me a head or two
No other solution you think we hollering and hooting
Until you wake up and then you got to hear 'bout these shootings
I take a pull from a loosey and put the clip in my pocket
Before I take another bullet I'm gon' pull it and pop it
And if it's beef my nigga, then let your guns do your talking
The graveyard has got plenty room for a coffin
They say that we responsible for boosting the crime rate
They say that we the reason that these young niggas buying weight
But I'm gonna keep this Glock on my waist 'til my dying day
It's Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang, G-Unit and Dr. Dre

[Chorus: 50 Cent]

316,Daddy Won't Sell The Farm,"His cows get loose and run right through the fast food parking lots
And Daddy gets calls from the mini-malls
When they're downwind from his hogs
When his tractor backs up traffic, the reception ain't too warm
The city's growing around him, but Daddy won't sell the farm
You can't roll a rock, up a hill that steep
You can't pull roots when they run that deep
He's gonna live and die, in the eye of an urban storm
Daddy won't sell the farm

He worked and slaved in '68, he bought these fields and trees
He raised his corn and a big red barn and a healthy family
He learned to love the woodlands, he can't stand to do them harm. There's concrete all
Around him, but Daddy won't sell the farm

You can't roll a rock, up a hill that steep
You can't pull roots when they run that deep
He's gonna live and die, in the eye of an urban storm
Daddy won't sell the farm

One day he's gonna leave it all to me and I'll start my own branch of the family tree
They'll get the message written on the roof of the barn, Daddy won't sell the farm

You can't roll a rock, up a hill that steep
You can't pull roots when they run that deep
He's gonna live and die, in the eye of an urban storm

I feel you (uhh), baby don't
But you can't, you can't give up
(H.E.A.T., 2Pac with, Outlawz!)

[Hook: 2Pac & H.E.A.T.]
Baby don't cry! I hope you got your head up (Outlawz)
Even when the road is hard, never give up!
Baby don't cry! I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up! (Keep ya head up)

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now here's a story 'bout a woman with dreams
So picture perfect at 13, an ebony queen
Beneath the surface it was more than just a crooked smile
Nobody knew about her secret so it took a while
I could see a tear fall slow down her black cheek
Sheddin' quiet tears in the back seat; so when she asked me
""What would you do if it was you?""
Couldn't answer such a horrible pain to live through
I tried to trade places in the tragedy
I couldn't picture three crazed niggas grabbin' me
For just a moment I was trapped in the pain
Lord, come and take me
Four niggas violated, they chased and they raped me
Even though it wasn't me, I could feel the grief
Thinkin' with your brains blown that would make the pain go
No! You got to find a way to survive
‘Cause they win when your soul dies

[Hook: 2Pac & H.E.A.T.]
Baby please don't cry!, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up!
Baby don't cry!, you got to keep your head up

Baby don't cry…

[Verse 2: Edi Amin]
Forget him, girl, he ain't gon' never change
I ain't no hater but that nigga lost in the game
After the bright lights and big thangs
He probably could love you, but he in love with the struggle
Everyday, his mind on gettin' mo'
And never your feelings, he's chasin' millions for sho'
Uh oh, now you 'bout to have his baby?
Another wild-ass nigga that's gon' drive you crazy
You got too much mo' livin' to do – I'm spittin' this to you
‘Cause you deserve more than what he givin' to you
Beautiful, black, precious, and complicated
A new millennium dime piece, so fine she
Got 'em all stuck standin' still when she come through
Baby, take a little mo' time, love'll find you
And sho' as the sky's blue somebody other than me
Gon' give you everythin' you need, feel me? (Don't cry-ahh…)

[Verse 3: Young Noble]
I'm tryin' to do all that I can
From jump, now you losin', you was choosin' the wrong man
Dealt the wrong hand, you was young and beautiful
Lost and turned out, what you let that nigga do to you?
I knew her since elementary, she blew a kiss to me
Wrote me a note in crayon, wantin' to get with me
We was kids, now she got three kids
They see their father e'ryday, and they don't know who he is
Seen him last night, homie roll a E-class
Mad cheese in the stash, still a deadbeat dad
I bring her Pampers and food, just to stop through
But those ain't my seeds, nothin' really I could do
I feel pity for you, you ain't even his wife
Seventeen with three kids, locked down for life
Should've chose me, she 'bout to OD from the pressure
Hell nah, I won't let her (BABY..)

It seems that you're not satisfied, there's too much on your mind

If I had balls
I'd tell you ""get away from me""
Guess I'm not smart
I let you unnerve me
I let you control me
Afraid that the truth would hurt me
When it's you that hurts me more

[Chorus]
Get outta my mouth
Get outta my hair
Get outta my mind
Stop puttin' words in my head
Get outta my mouth
You're nothing but trouble
Get outta my life
Get out of me

Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie

Dear lie, you're dumb
You think you've got the best of me
You think you've won
Misread my vulnerability
I've got, your balls (I've got, your balls)
Now get the hell away from me
I've learned ,your heart (I've learned, your heart)
Won't let you unnerve me
Won't let you control me
The truth will only free me
And your lies won't hurt no, no more

325,Angels,"[Intro: Chance The Rapper]
Angels, na, na, na, na, ah

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
I got my city doing front flips
When every father, mayor, rapper jump ship
I guess that's why they call it where I stay
Clean up the streets, so my daughter can have somewhere to play
I'm the blueprint to a real man
Some of these niggas toss they tassel for a deal man
I ain't goin' to hell or to Hillman
Igh, Igh, Igh, Igh, for my real fans
I got caught up with a little Xan
Can't stop me but it slow me though
Yeah a nigga famous, you don't know me though
But every DJ still play me though
Damn man, I don't even need a radio
And my new shit sound like a rodeo
Got the old folks dancing the Do-si-do
'Til they fuck around and sign me to OVO
Oooh, I just might share my next one with Keef
Got the industry in disbelief, they be asking for beef
This what it sound like when God split an atom with me
I even had Steve giving out apples for free

[Chorus: Saba]
They was talking ""woo this woo wap da bam""
City so damn great, I feel like Alexand'
Wear your halo like a hat, that's like the latest fashion
I got angels all around me they keep me surrounded

Who is you, and who the fuck is you, and who is him?
All of a sudden, woo wap da bam
You can't touch me
Na, na, na, na, I got angels
I got angels

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
I ain't change my number since the seventh grade
This for my day one, ten years, seven days
A week, niggas never tired on they Kevin Gates
And if they rest in peace they bunny hopping heaven's gates
It's too many young angels on the southside
Got us scared to let our grandmommas outside
You gon' make me take the campers way downtown
You gon' make me turn my BM to my housewife
I just had a growth spurt
It done took so long, my tippy toes hurt
You can keep the nose ring, I don't have to soul search
I'm still at my old church, only ever sold merch
Grandma say I'm Kosher, momma say I'm culture
GCI, 1-0-7-5, angel goin' live
Power 92, angel, juke, angel gon' juke
GCI, 1-0-7-5, goin' live
Power 92, angel gon' juke, juke, juke, juke

Says, ""Where have you been?""
I've been waiting for you

And I got nothing to do

I been bumming around this old town so long
I been hangin' around this town on the corner
I been bumming around this old town for way too long

We spend all day getting sober
Hiding from daylight
Watching TV
We just look a lot better in the blue light
Well, you know I gotta get out
But I'm stuck so tight
Weighed by the chains that keep me...

Hangin' around this town on the corner
I been bumming around this old town too long
I been hangin' around this town on the corner
I been bumming around this old town for way too long

And this girl listens to the band play
She says, ""Where have you been?""
I've been lying right here on the floor
Well, I got all this time
To be waiting for what is mine
To be hating what I am
After the light has faded

Hangin' around this town on the corner
I been bumming around this old town so long
I been hangin' around this town on the corner
I been bumming around this old town for way, way

I been hangin' around this town on the corner

Game don't wait (heavy. wait.)
Eyes heavy but it's time to grind motherfucker
Can't be late (hold up. wait.)
Fuck a nine-to-five, push work state-to-state (shit)
No work, no food, still eatin' off paper plates
Banana clip is a paperweight, paper mate
Tell 'em how you're married to the game
She fuckin' everybody but you still put a ring on it, on it
Keep it one hunnit, homies, home is where the homies
Home is where the homies got your back
Get your backpack get
Back to the block, bring it back to the block, shit

But the Glock cocked back, lay another body flat

Here when they turn on the street lights
Hustle 'til they cut 'em off, that's the street life
Got the chrome on my hip and a bird for sale
That's how I get mine, that's how I get it

[Verse 2: Daveed Diggs]
Hustlin' is a habit, so they say
This is for the G's who wasn't trippin' and never knew any other way
Other ways of gettin' money, not many do not require
A degree of separation from the streets you gettin' paid in
In which the degree of difficulty is extraordinarily high
And she high while doin' it so see why
Somebody who isn't from it might not understand
How you body a body in other words (how I could just kill a man)
And still a gram is a gram and nobody is Instagramin'
They killin' on Cypress Hill and they still is squeezin' the hammers
Police is beyond the scanners, these some obsequious bandits
And brandishin' flags of function
You fuck a figure, it's fashion then flash on a motherfucker
You fuckin' seeing the passion, forgetting the hunger
This the jungle, time to get active and crack it
So acrobatic, it'll flip in a sec, but set's up and no second guessing
Here in the street, people sweating for the money

[Hook: Mariel Jacoda]
Here when they turn on the street lights
Hustle 'til they cut 'em off, that's the street life
Got the chrome on my hip and a bird for sale
That's how I get mine, that's how I get it

[Verse 3: Daveed Diggs]
No time for wifey's babies or other collateral damage
Checking for snitches, they be the ones order tacos in Spanish
Always thinking that they blendin' in, but then sending them telegrams
To the rollers, they bitches, not meaning feminine
Meaning, fuck it, ain't no explaining, get the fuck up and push cocaine
All these fuckers gon' sleep all day
But if you suck up when one of you step up to these bucks
Knock if you lacing up them chucks, no Taylor Gangin'
This shit is grimy and dirty, clothes stankin' while you slangin'
Get up out to the blacktop, backpack for the crack rock
Take shot at the cops at a spot where they knock a neighborhood watch
Watch him, learn the code if them eyes are closed
That means he sleeping on his feet and been out in the cold
And if he flashin' the gold
He either new or want action and got back up on the toes
Study all of your fractions, get up on the honor roll
Roll the marijuana then flip the hoodie up and get ghost

[Hook: Mariel Jacoda]
Here when they turn on the street lights
Hustle 'til they cut 'em off, that's the street life
Got the chrome on my hip and a bird for sale, ayy
And if you trying to take this spot, better think twice
This ain't play time, you're fucking with my life

334,Still In My Heart,"I live inside a fleeting dream
Chasing every vestige I can see
Avoid the cruel reality

The day you left you left me blind
But I could see the tears you tried to hide
Now the time is crawling by

I been runnin' 'round inside a trance
I could never feel the same
Maybe I will never get the chance
Just to hold you in my arms again

Livin' in a world with you
It's tearing me apart
Carrying this sorrow through
You're still in my heart

I'll be everywhere I'm high and low
In whatever form you know
This love will never fade away
Or go astray

You said to me these last few words
'No matter what I'll find you I am sure'

But that ain't gonna happen any more
Believe me it's true, and all that I ask of you

Put your hand in mine to make this real love
Put your hand in mine to make this beautiful

So you say that she will only break your heart
Don't you think it's time you made a brand new start?
Believe me it's true, and all that I ask of you

If tomorrow is judgement day (sing mommy)
And I'm standin' on the front line
And the Lord ask me what I did with my life
I will say I spent it with you

If I wake up in WW 3
I see destruction and poverty
And I feel like I want to go home
It's okay if your commin' with me

Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of this world couldn't hold us

If I lose my fame and fortune
And I'm homeless on the street
And I'm sleepin' in Grand Central Station
It's okay if you're sleepin' with me

As the years they pass us by
We stay young through each other's eyes
And no matter how old we get
It's okay as long as I got you babe

If I should die this very day
Don't cry, cause on earth we wasn't meant to stay
And no matter what people say
I'll be waiting for you after judgement day

Dirt nasty need some drugs like
My baby dick needs a tug like right now
So hop that ass in the bath tub
What do I do when im too fucked up
Can't keep it up cause her boob job sucks
And what does she do when I whip it out
Close her eyes and open her mouth
I think I need a intervention
C-c-c-coke ,dope ,weed ,and then perscription
So listen up little children
Dirt diggler you be illin'
Im feelin kinda drowsy
Dont do drugs without me

What do you say when your too fucked up
Whatcha girlfriend say when I smack that butt

Whatcha gonna do when you get too faded
And the date you with wanna get X rated
Andre legacy I stay sedated
Put me in the wheel chair and get me on the plane bitch
F-f-f-famous for bein opiated
Up in this club I fell asleep on the table
Tip the waitress pinch the ass
I gave her my number
The kid's got panache, lick on my stash
It ain't that easy livin this fast

Forget to pass corn beef and hash
Horny little bitches like to call me their dad
It ain't that bad put my dick in they mouth
And my nose in they coke bag

Whatcha girlfriend say when I smack that butt
What do you say when you run outta drugs

And that bitch that I like to fuck with won't come
I could try my luck with a penis pump
Go get me some intravenous love
Birds and bees and worms and slugs
Turn to me or turn to drugs
Word on the street is I stink like a bum
But its hard to take a shower when ya can't wake up
What do I do when there ain't none left
Make a call to the pony express
Garuntee 40 minutes or less
Costs a bit more but only bring the best
Ever seen a bitch in the brand new dress
With a fat old man tryin to look all fresh
Well i've been with the worst and the best
And I could n't even tell the difference

What do you say when your too fucked up
Whatcha girlfriend say when I smack that butt
What do you say when you run outta drugs
And baby whatcha say when ya bust a nut

Ona wybacza moje wady, wybacza błędy
Rozumie moje dziaby i złote zęby
Odbijam zwykłych typów w nich, gdy chcę polatać z nią
Z moją malutką candy, mam od niej plakat z Blow
Bo tylko ona zna mój ulubiony film
I kuma dobrze mój popierdolony styl
Jestem wolny tylko z nią, wolny tylko z nią
Jestem wolny tylko z nią, wolny tylko z nią
Skarbie jesteś mi potrzebna, gdy nie mam się do kogo odezwać
Gdy cały ten fejm mnie przerasta
I było nie raz tak, już chciałem się chlastać
A wtedy Ty wybaczasz moje wady, wybaczasz błędy
Rozumiesz moje dziaby i złote zęby
Odbijam ten zepsuty świat, gdy idę tędy z Tobą
Z moją malutką candy, którą mam zawsze obok
Bo tylko ona wie w którą stronę chcę iść
I tylko ona zna mój ulubiony hit
Jestem wolny tylko z nią, wolny tylko z nią
Jestem wolny tylko z nią, wolny tylko z nią

Wonderin' where you are, I wish

Wish for you on a falling star, wondering where you are
Do I ever cross your mind in the warm sunshine?
She's from the City of Angels like Betty Davis, James Dean, and Gable
Never know what she means to me, I fell for the girl that's on TV

Met her at a counter affair
She wore a green dress and everybody was there
Felt out of place
Till she looked into my eyes

Shook your hand around 9 p.m
And I'm never gonna be the same again
Never had to be on a movie screen
To be the leading lady in all my dreams

Shooby-doo-wop and Scooby Snacks, met a fly girl and I can't relax
The only problem is she's a movie star, oh
My friends, they won't believe me if they could only see me
At the risk of soundin' cheesy, I think I fell for the girl on TV

Wish for you on a falling star, wondering where you are
Do I ever cross your mind in the warm sunshine?
She's from the City of Angels like Betty Davis, James Dean, and Gable
Never know what she means to me, I fell for the girl that's on TV

Everybody knows her name
They wanna take a picture and they're glad she came
But I just wanna be there when she's down, down
(Be there when she's down)

I don't want her autograph
I just wanna call her up and make her laugh
Never had to be on a movie screen
To be the leading lady in all my dreams

The only problem is she's a movie star, oh
My friends, they won't believe me if they could only see me

I'm wishing on a star and I'm wonderin' where you are
(Wondering where you are)
Do I cross your mind in the warm sunshine?

Yeah, so I wish for you on a bright shining star
Every where I look, there you are, there you are
It's the girl in the green dress, she took my breath away
And now I look to the sky for a better day

To the beach shore and Scooby Snacks
I met a fly girl and I can't relax
Never had to be on a movie screen
Cause she's the leading lady in all my dreams, come on

Roc-A-Fella.. y'all know what this is
We givin' y'all five seconds to put your drink down
And report to the dance floor immediately
All the busters we givin' y'all five seconds to get close to a exit
It's about to get real ugly in here
Five seconds is up - let's go!
(Throw the hands up) uh, uh, uh

You know how Mack come through on the club tip
E'rybody real deep on that thug shit
Cop Cris' spray the club on that thug shit
Cop frisks suits snub in the club quick
Told y'all real high, when I come you can try
If you want, you can die, if you want to
We hittin' whores on the floor, whole crew be wild
Bitch back that ass up like Juvenile (huh)
When my peeps come to spend, a dime apiece
You know Mack come through with a line of freaks
Every bitch on the hip be a 9 at least
We gettin' head on the floor, while you grindin' freaks
Whole squad get it down like this
Whole squad buyin' rounds of Cris'
Whole squad got they crowns on wrist
Whole squad got a pound to twist
Whole squad got a pound to spit, in case a clown wanna flip
Mac never slip in the club
Told y'all niggas four-fifth in the club
If a nigga wanna draw then the blood it can drip in the club
You know how niggas get in the club
Shit you know how I be, all high in V.I.P
Rollin' up to B.I.G. (baby-baby)
Niggas be all liquored up, talkin' shit

By the way, yo..
How the fuck you gon' talk about MC's on our heel?
When we just cop them things homie, the chromey wheels
Both arms are chunky, the sleeves on chill
Any given times a hundred G's in your grill
Don't talk to me 'bout MC's got skills
""He's alright, but he's not real""
Jay-Z's that deal, with Sigs in the field
Love affair for war, hug, squeeze that steel
Fuck, you got a flow, that's cool with me
You got a little dough, that's cool with me
You got a little cars, little jewelries
But none of y'all muh'fuckers could fool with me
You know the wrist frostbit minus two degrees
'Bout as blue as the sea, the way I maneuver the V
Hat cocked can't see his eyes, who could it be?
With that new blue Yankee on, who but me?
Niggas shipped two million, then I blew to three
Then I skated to four, 'fore I went on tour
I came back and it's plain, y'all niggas ain't rappin' the same
Fuck the flow, y'all jackin' our slang
I seen the same shit happen to Kane
Three cuts in your eyebrows tryin' to wild out
The game is ours, we'll never foul out
Y'all just better hope we gracefully bow out
Throw yo' hands up - niggas, bitches, busters
Hustlers, fuck that! (Throw the hands up), c'mon

Transmission, third World War, third round
A decade of the weapon of sound above ground
No shelter if you're looking for shade
I lick shots at the brutal charade
As the polls close like a casket, on truth devoured
A silent play on the shadow of power
A spectacle monopolized
The camera's eyes on choice disguised
Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil?
Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?
Yes, a spectacle monopolized
They hold the reins, stole your eyes
All the Fistagons, the bullets, and bombs
Who stuff the banks, who staff the party ranks
More for Gore, or the son of a drug lord
None of the above, fuck it, cut the cord!

An army of pigs try to silence my style

Pop a top, again
I just got time for one more round
Set em' up my friend
Then I'll be gone;
And you can let some other fool sit down

[Verse 1]
I'd like for you to listen to a joke I heard today
From a woman who said she was through and calmly walked away
I tried to smile, and did a while; but it felt so outta place
Did you ever hear of a clown with tear drops streaming down his face?

[Chorus]
Pop a top, again
I think I'll have another round
Set em' up my friend
Then I'll be gone and you can let some other fool sit down

[Verse 2]
Home for me, is misery, and here I'm wasting time
Cause a row of fools on a row of stools is not what's on my mind
But then you see her leaving me. It's not what I perfer

[Verse 1: Donell Jones]
Me and my niggas be rollin'
Scheming on you and your homies
The very first day of summer
All chromed out in a Hummer babe
Hit the park and parlay
Hope that you walk this way
Do you and your girls wanna ride
Play all day, puff on the la

[Bridge: Donell Jones]
Ooh say what, say what, say what
(You know that I like it baby)
Ooh girl you know what's up

Peep her thighs and I'm zoning
Right around two in the morning

Uh, say what? say what? say what?
So baby tell me what's up
Can we ascend to higher heights
And when the path gets rough
We can give into brighter nights breathe with peace
Expound by leaps, and soul to reap, our souls to keep
The passion's deep, and filled with heat
Living this life on the hustle, I barely get enough time
You know me from the platinum, how I stack them and shine
You see a lot of contenders, they try to end up in my world
A reputation known as the untouchable girl
I'm moving on now, trying to make a change in my ways
Be the best that I can be to last me all of my days
Now we can blaze pathways or just take our time
Better holla if ya hear me cause Left Eye gon' shine
My eyes don't lie, see how they glisten when you pass me by
You and I don't need permission to be unified
Surely I done seen and heard of many places
Then I travelled around the world, seen many faces
Don't let another one get near me if you wanna be true
And show me that nobody else can do it better than you
So if you're serious, I'm curious to see what you got
But love is furious cause I believe in blowing up spots

[Hook: Donell Jones]
I'm digging you and I'm feeling you
And you know what's up
Said I'm diggin' you and I'm wanting you

346,Learn To Fly,"[Produced by The Awesome Sound]

[Hook: Betty Trouble]
I learn to fly, so you
You run to find the gun
To shoot me down
Before I get too high
I learn to fly, so you
You run to find a gun
To shoot me down
Before I get too high

[Verse 1: XV]
See, I grew up on that Northside
Where the ballers don't play courtside
They wear colors
And ride for they brothers
Throw up they C's up and B's up and courts high
And I touched my first 45
When Jordan was wearing that 45
And I couldn't ball, I was like 4'5""
So I stayed inside writing up more rhymes
Well of course I
Had problems with thugs
Who told me that I couldn't get any love
In the city I'm from
Don't know why
I stay here, never said bye
Dad said no, Mom said try
Shorty said who? Now says hi
Teacher sighs
Said what you gonna do
When you leave school
And I said I...

[Hook]

[Verse 2: XV]
More fire, more fire
As I get higher and higher
My bars get tighter than Rikers
When I get behind mics like I'm Myers
And they on my bandwagon, call it Radio Flyer
But if you rolling
Come on then
I hope you saving your tires
Don't buy my CD
Just to see me
Before the day I expire
I am here Permanente
I swear my name could be Kaiser
No fat lady's gonna sing
Skinny chicks in my choir
And life's a bitch
But I swear that bitch couldn't be finer
I asked my momma, where we go from here?
No clue till we die
So living like this our last is the move for the night
Called me a nerd in high school, now my school is so high
I'm flying first class, like my homeroom's in the sky
And I...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Knew that I could, when they told me I can't
Said I was good, I told them I'm great
Funny my hood, they told me I changed
And I said yea, only the game
Now I am here
Throwing up squares
Ls and 7s all up in the air
They asking me, Vizzy you really prepared?
I say hell yea, where's my chair?
Keep your throne, leave my wings
I am grown, off something
That got me flyer and feeling super, I am Mario 3
This is when no one knew who I would be
Back then, when no one would ever believe
Now they see, cause now I'm fly
With my dreams, in front of they eyes

348,He Didn't Have To Be,"[Verse 1]
When a single mom goes out on a date with somebody new
It always winds up feelin' more like a job interview
My momma used to wonder if she'd ever meet someone
Who wouldn't find out about me and then turn around and run

[Verse 2]
I met the man I call my dad when I was five years old
He took my mom out to a movie and for once I got to go
A few months later I remember lyin' there in bed
I overheard him pop the question and prayed that she'd say yes

[Chorus]
And then all of a sudden, oh, it seemed so strange to me
How we went from somethin's missin' to a family
Lookin' back all I can say about all the things he did for me
Is I hope I'm at least half the dad that he didn't have to be

[Verse 3]
I met the girl that's now my wife about three years ago
We had the perfect marriage but we wanted somethin' more
Now here I stand surrounded by our family and friends
Crowded 'round the nursery window as they bring the baby in

[Chorus]
And now all of a sudden, oh, it seems so strange to me
How we've gone from somethin's missin' to a family
Lookin' through the glass I think about the man that's standin' next to me
And I hope I'm at least half the dad that he didn't have to be

[Bridge]
And lookin' back all I can say about all the things he did for me
Is I hope I'm at least half the dad that he didn't have to be

The way it is, is the way that it was

When I said I do, I meant that I will
Til' the end of all time
Be faithful and true, devoted to you

And the world stays the same
For all who came before
And it goes hand in hand

Only you and I can undo
All that we became
That makes us so much more (so much more)
Than a woman and a man

After everything
That comes and goes around
Has only passed us by
Here alone in our dreams

I know there's a lonely heart
In every lost and found
But forever you and I will be the ones
Who found out what forever means

How you gonna see her now?
So far from sincere
Fabrications in my ear
Drive me so far up the wall, I come slidin' down

What is this I see (I don't believe this)
You don't come home to me

How I dress is a reflection of me

360,Smoke Rings In The Dark,"[Verse 1]
Well I won't make you tell me
What I've come to understand
You're a certain kind of woman and
I'm a different kind of man
I've tried to make you love me
You've tried to find a spark of the flame that burned and
Somehow turned to smoke ring in the dark
The loneliness within me
Takes a heavy toll
Because it burns as slow as whiskey
Through an empty aching soul and
The night is like a dagger
Long and cold and sharp
As I sit here on the front steps
Blowing smoke rings in the dark

[Chorus]
I- I- I know I must be going
Because loves already gone and
All I'm taking with me are the pieces of my heart and
All I'll leave are smoke rings in the dark

[Verse 2]
The rain falls where it wants to
Wind blows where it will
Everything on earth goes somewhere
But I swear we're standin' still
So I'm not going to wake you
I'll go easy on your heart
I'll just touch your face and drift away
Like smoke rings in the dark

[Chorus]
I- I- I know I must be going
Because loves already gone and
All I'm taking with me are the pieces of my heart and
All I'll leave are smoke rings in the dark",Gary Allan,2000,"[92, 77, 76, 78, 80]",5

Blinded by all these street lights, up late, can't sleep nights

Masked up, this ain't trick or treat, one wrong move they finna squeeze
We ain't come for peace, you can bend your knees and pray all day
They waiting on me to give an a-okay, then the K gon' spray
But today's your day, I'mma let you live, I'mma let you pay
Back everything you ever said to me so start with the thing that you said to me
I was worthless, I'd never make it, go ahead! Spill that hatred
You are now face to face with a thorough pharaoh who be down on Death Row
You says to me but I'll let you, now let go
Chevy filled up on Petrol, times like this I just roll

I'm after you bringing traffic through

I make 'em sweat from beginners to the vets, I'm a threat
Some niggas double up on they fifty bets
I gotta be nice to the dice, so I'm talkin' to 'em
I step back, gave a tap on the sidewalk and threw 'em
Nigga went and put his foot in the way, see
And tried to ace me
Now I got niggas rollin' to that bitch Tracy
Yeah, but Tracy ain't too gentle
Niggas thought she was simple
And loses with two deuces and a fuckin' pimple (""A loser!"")
I crack another brew, sit back and watch what niggas do
Who threw that two? You? I'm rollin' the whole fuckin' crew
One by one niggas come payin', that fell to the trey and
Furlough inside the bait, that's what a nigga sayin'
Your luck is tough, I'm makin' enough to buy a kilo
Uh-oh, look out below, I think I rolled another cee-lo
Pick up my crap, niggas don't get back a dime of that
And keep my hand right by my waist where my nine is at
One more chance and niggas quit, that's on zero
Broke, cryin' broke, I'm doin' backstrokes in cee-notes
Crazy pockets are empty, what a god damn shame

[Verse 1: Fred Durst & Method Man]
Who could be the boss? Look up to the cross
Stranded in the land of the lost
Standin' up, I'm sideways
I'm blazin' up the path, runnin' on the highways of rap
Choked up by the smoke and the charcoal
A lotta stamps and brands, we like a bar code
I'm bashin' all the media strikes to keep the media dykes
As reinforcement for the fight
And that alone'll keep John Gotti on the phone
I'm tangled in the zone, I got the bees on the track
Where the fuck you at? (Tical!)
Let me hear you pigeons run ya mouth now (Shut the fuck up!)
I'm pluggin' in them social skills that keep my total bills
Over a million the last time I checked it
Thank God, I'm blessed with a mind that'll wreck it
Wait until the second round and knock 'em out

[Verse 2: Method Man]
They call me Big John Studd, my middle name Mud
Dirty water flow, too much for you thug
They can't stand the flood – what up, doc?
Hold big gun like Elmer Fudd,  the sureshot
Mr. Meth I'm unplugged (learn!)
Temperatures too hot for sunblock (burn!)
Playin' wit' minds that get you state time
Locked behind 12 bars from a great mind
Killa bees in the club wit' this ladybug
Brought a sword to the dance floor to cut a rug
Love is love all day, til' they throw slugs
And take another life in cold blood, can't feel me 'til its your blood
Murder rates tremendous, crime is endless
Same shit different day, Father forgive us
They know not what they do, all praise is due
I'm big like E-Z and Big Bambu

Headstrong, dead calm, Dead by Dawn
Dead weight, they dead wrong, let's get it on
Twelve rounds of throw down – who hold crown?
Protect land wit' four pound, Limp Bizkit
Get around like merry-go, bust a scenario
Comin' through your stereo, why risk it?
Lifestyles of the prolific and gifted
Eight essential vitamins and minerals, delicious
Word on the street is, they bit my thesis
Knocked out they front teefes, tryin' to taste mine
Actin' like they heard it through the grapevine
Dope fiendin' for the bassline, to provide rhyme
Pharmaceuticals, hard as nails to the cuticles
Where'd you find that monster? She beautiful
Wu-Tang and Limp Bizkit, roll on the set
Kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, and then jet

[Verse 4: Fred Durst & Method Man]
Mic check, so what's it all about? And where we gonna run?
Maybe we can meet up on the sun
Discretion is advised for the blood of virgin eyes
We limpin' on the track with the Method
So get the sunblock, you gettin' one-shot
Until you dissolve, I revolve around everything you got
From outta nowhere, prepare, you be blinded by the glare
I told you not to stare, now you're turned into stone
Without a microphone, but don't you forget you're in a zone
So shut the fuck up, and take that shit back
'Cause all your shit's wack (Doo doo is doo doo)
When its weighed out like that
Burnin' up your brain like a piston
So all those that didn't listen
Now they even knew what they were missin'
And never even knew that the sky was fallin' down
Wu-Tang-Clan for the crown

Yo, alot of people be steppin to us like
Y'all from San Francisco right?
Nah G we show alot of love
For the state of California from Humboldt to Oceanside ya dig
But L.A. is where it all happens for the Dub and Thes One
All you MC's say L.A. when you on stage
And when you do spit that hot verse
We gonna make it happen man

[Verse One: Double K]
Who wanna test?
We lickin' off shots in the west
We make believers out the best
Lay the weak to rest
In southern Californ' now ain't no place like this
Half the stuff y'all doin' we created this shit
So don't be saggin young buck in the presence of this
Don't even come from the city and you runnin your lip
I'm 'bout to make a call get the news van out
Explain to Tritia Toyota on how your crew ran out
We comin live from the trey two three area code
Mad clouds of smoke and ain't no room for snow
Ah, sucka niggas with sucka beats
Stay in the back seat and buckle up for the ride
I'm chillin with bad guys
And got time on my side
Cause this is my city this is where I live
And if ya bring bad vibes I got something to give
Hangin out under the sun is an everyday thang
And gettin crazy in the labs the only way I bang
Don't step to me with that mean face
Buddy I'm all smiles and I'm countin the miles
Down Crescent Heights boulevard
Home of the stars
Get ya pulled out ya car for frontin' too hard
Just listen, you ain't down with the streets my brotha?
I can forsee in your future there's some runnin for cover
Alot of y'all talk a good game
But ain't playin
I learned about the hood and now a field is where your stayin
Fools be givin you the mad dog after the show
Cause we ain't feelin them flows
Or your designer clothes
There's phony people in L.A. I counted its alot
And if they ain't a snitch or a bullin', they're claimin your block
Just get it right its Crescent Heights, all day, all night
The community where I was raised
Livin my days
Wishin I could be the mayor i'd deport you fools
And send you back to squareland cause over here we rule?
Authentic people in the town
Throw up your dub take a drag
It's Double K signin off from the home of the bodybags

[Verse Two: Thes One]
Now about five years after they kill Creeper
The hot Wrestling move was the sleeper
Drug dealers rock beepers
T tops, jerry curls, jelly flip flops for girls
C.B.'s on the strip and a commercial for World on Wheels I whistle to my crew up on the block
The COLORS soundtrack rocked the Fatburger jukebox
My L.A. U.S.C. memories are emery sticks who filed down clowns
Claimin the same tricks on this turf
My roots go deep like turbo Nerf
And the cops still sweat us
I roll on all blocks like I'm sellin paletas
And rock the bells
Home of the drive-by where they pop the shells
I eat at Chano's and La Barca, not Taco Bell
And if you're not from the city then you should probably bail
Cause alot of cats are implants
Claimin L.A with something to say and something to prove in
At the shows with the flows and they think the crowd's groovin
Its like the 405 at 5:30 nobodys movin
I'm tired of non-recognition losin the mission to proven to cats
That my soundtracks and L.A. hat
When newjacks jock New York rap on a block
With a palm tree it makes me sick
All you underground producers get off Premier's dick and just (chill)
I'm headed back to Pedro to sit up on the hill
Next to the Korean bell eatin Busy Bee
Watchin waves swell high visibility Catalina and sail boats
Hollywood hip hop soaps and sit-com dreams
I make morphine for beat fiends
Support L.A. teens stay trippin with Cal Green
O.G. Jerry Duffey when I'm on your screen
I'm friends with neighborhood crack heads
And I know (?Ben?)
L.A. is the place where I solve my problems
In it i'll never fear
I'll always stay here
Cause when I'm in L.A. my family's there

Love rules the world, you feel me

[R. Kelly-Hook]
He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

[Verse 1]
When it hurt I ease the pain girl, caress your frame
Get them worries off your brain girl, I'm in your corner
Do what you want, it's your thing girl, I persist and try but
We one in the same girl, it ain't a game
So I can't play with you, I wanna lay with you
Stay with you, pray with you, grow old and gray with you
In good and bad times, we'll always make it through
Cause what we got is true, no matter what they say to you
I could straight lace you, not just appearance
Stimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits
Be that voice of reason when you ain't tryna hear it
You want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it
Sit her on the sofa, get a little closer
Touch you right, do it like a man's suppose to
Knew you was the one, that's why I chose you
Cause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Your soul ain't a toy, you ain't dealin' with a boy
Feel emptiness inside? I can fill that void
When you spend time with your woman and listen
It shines more than any baguette diamond can glisten
I can't impress you with the cars and the wealth
Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself
I'd rather show you it's heartfelt, make your heart melt
And prove to you you're more important than anything else
Worthwhile, special like my first child
When I see your face it's always like the first time
Our eyes met, I knew we'd be together in a tri-jet
I wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet
Hold you, mold you, don't know, let me show you
Ain't no tellin' what we could grow to
Let it be known, I told you
And I'mma be there for whatever you go through, my love's true

Don't let him sing you a sad song (No baby)

I do, satisfy you
(You don't have to wait on him)

[Verse 3]
I'm the light when you can't see
I'm that air when you can't breathe
I'm that feeling when you can't leave
Some doubt, some believe, some lie, cheat, and deceive
So it's only you and me
When you weak, I'll make you strong, here's where you belong
I ain't perfect, but I promise I won't do you wrong
Keep you away from harm, my love is protected
I'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected
I'll just make you aware of what we have is rare
In the moment of despair, I'm the courage when you're scared
Loyal, down for you, soon as I saw you
Wanted to be there cause I could hold it down for you
Be around for you, plant seeds in the soil
Make love all night, bending bed coils
You're a queen, therefore I treat you royal
This is all for you, cause I simply adore you

Paint a symphony of supporters

377,Still D.R.E.,"[Produced by Dr. Dre, Scott Storch and Mel-Man]

[Intro: Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre]
Yeah, nigga, we're still fuckin' with you
Still waters run deep
Still Snoop Dogg and D.R.E.
'99, nigga,  guess who's back
Still, still doin' that shit Andre?
Oh for sho'
Yeah
Check me out

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg]
It's still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
‘Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How? Nigga, my last album was The Chronic
They wanna know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they wanna know how I feel about it
(If you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still puffin' my leaves, still fuck with the beats
Still not lovin' police (Uh-uh)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (For sho')
Still got love for the streets, reppin' 213 (For life)
Still the beats bang, still doin' my thang
Since I left ain't too much changed, still

[Hook: Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre]
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them lo-los, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dippin' again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doin' 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali weed: I smoke 'til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire 'til you're soakin' in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since ""Turn Off the Lights"" from the World Class Wreckin Cru
I'm still at it, after mathematics
In the home of drive-bys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through, then I get skin, D.R.E.

[Hook: Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre]
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg]
It ain't nothin' but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether you're coolin' on the corner with your fly bitch
Laid back in the shack, play this track
I'm representin' for the gangstas all across the world
Still (Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king, but the ace is back
(So if you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre be the name, still runnin' the game
Still got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't trippin', love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more livin' hard
Barbeques every day, drivin' fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless (Still)

[Hook: Snoop Dogg (& Dr. Dre)]
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world

Right back up in your mothafuckin' ass
9-5 plus four pennies! Add that shit up
D.R.E. right back up on top of thangs
Smoke some with your Dogg
No stress, no seeds, no stems, no sticks!
Some of that real sticky icky icky
Ooh wee! Put it in the air!

378,She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy,"[Verse 1]
Plowing these fields in the hot summer sun
Over by the gate lordy here she comes
With a basket full of chicken and a big cold jug of sweet tea
I make a little room and she climbs on up
Open up a throttle and stir a little dust
Just look at her face she ain’t a fooling me

[Chorus]
She thinks my tractor's sexy
It really turns her on
She's always staring at me
While I'm chugging along
She likes the way it's pulling while we're tilling up the land
She's even kind of crazy 'bout my farmer's tan
She's the only one who really understands what gets me
She thinks my tractor's sexy

[Verse 2]
We ride back and forth 'til we run out of light
Take it to the barn put it up for the night
Climb up in the loft sit and talk with the radio on
She said she's got a dream and I asked what it is
She wants a little farm and a yard full of kids
One more teeny weenie ride before take her home

[Chorus]
She thinks my tractor's sexy
It really turns her on
She's always staring at me
While I'm chugging along
She likes the way it's pulling while we're tilling up the land

Well, she isn’t into cars or pickup trucks
But if it runs like a Deere, man, her eyes light up

She thinks my tractor's

It really turns her on
She's always staring at me
While I'm chugging along
She likes the way it's pulling while we're tilling up the land

Look into the mirror, who's inside there
The one with the long hair
Same old me again today, yeah

Be in the position that make me feel
So damn unpretty

But i’m known to rock the microphone
Bet you no trick puts it down like me
An insane chica throwing up S.D
LPG, 1, 2, 3
That’s how many jinas that I brought with me
Together we're four when we step out the door
Everybody lookin' with their mouths to the floor
We hit the dance floor movin' so exotic
You gave me your number but I think I forgot it
I’m so wild and I’m so crazy
A sexy ruca that can work it baby
We can do it nasty and gangsta
Put it on me loco 'cause I know you ain’t a wanksta…

But get more cash takin' it from you tricks…

Gangsta’s boogie

I like my toys
I play with boys
I’m a freak behind doors
Make a lot of noise
Give it to me fast and give it to me slow
Picture this hump up and down your pole
Probably spot me cruising on the par
Five hot latinas don’t you wanna ride
I’m a thugged out mami in a sexy skirt
I love tequila and I like to flirt
Move your body to the beat
When you hear this in the club get out your seat
Nice tight body, call me Sancha

381,Steal My Sunshine,"[Intro: Tim & Matt]
Hey, Matt
Yeah, Tim?
Hey, you talked to Marc lately?
Uh, haven't really talked to him but he looks pretty, uh, down
""He looks pretty, uh, down?""
Yeah, well, maybe we should cheer him up then
What do you, uh, suppose we should do?
Well, does he like butter tarts?

[Verse 1: Marc]
I was lying on the grass of Sunday morning of last week
Indulging in my self-defeat
My mind was thugged, all laced and bugged, all twisted, wrong and beat
A comfortable three feet deep
Now the fuzzy stare from not being there on a confusing morning week
Impaired my tribal lunar speak
And of course you can't become if you only say what you would have done
So I missed a million miles of fun

[Chorus: Marc & (Sharon)]
I know it's up for me
(If you steal my sunshine)
Making sure I'm not in too deep
(If you steal my sunshine)
Keeping versed and on my feet
(If you steal my sunshine)

[Spoken: Tim & Chad]
Chad, come here, come here, come here
Wow, look at her
I know
Man, I've never seen Sharon look so bad before
I did once before, but this is pretty bad
Yeah, what do you think she got up to last night?
Well, I... Sharon, I love you!

[Verse 2: Sharon]
I was frying on the bench slide in the park across the street
L-A-T-E-R that week
My sticky paws were into making straws out of big fat slurpy treats
An incredible eight-foot heap
Now the funny glare to pay a gleaming tare in a staring under heat
Involved an under usual feat
And I'm not only among but I invite who I want to come
So I missed a million miles of fun

[Chorus: Marc & (Sharon)]
I know it's up for me
(If you steal my sunshine)
Making sure I'm not in too deep
(If you steal my sunshine)
Keeping versed and on my feet
(If you steal my sunshine)

[Chorus 2: Marc & (Sharon)]
I know it's done for me
(If you steal my sunshine)
Not some and hard to see
(If you steal my sunshine)
Keeping dumb and built to beat
(If you steal my sunshine)

[Outro: Marc & Sharon]
My sunshine, if you steal my sunshine
My sunshine, if you steal my sunshine
My sunshine, if you steal my sunshine
My sunshine, if you steal my sunshine

Medallion iced up, Rolex bezelled up
And my pinky ring is platinum plus
Earrings be trillion cut and my grill be slugged up
My heart filled with anger cause nigga I don't give a fuck
Stack my cheese up, cause one day I'ma give this street life up
Beef I don't discuss, a nigga outta line gon' get his motherfuckin' head bust

Bling bling, every time I buy a new ride
Bling bling, Lorinsers on Yokahama tires
Bling bling

[Verse 3: Mannie Fresh]
It's the nigga with the Lex bubble
Candy-coated helicopter with the leather cover
If ya suckin' not fuckin' take off the rubber
Then toss that bitch nigga cause I don't love her
Balla, Manny bought a private plane
Then turned around and sold that bitch to Juve and Wayne
They put thirty-inch Lorinsers on that thing man
I know you niggas out there just don't understand

[Verse 4: Juvenile]
I'm a 1999 driver, I'm a uptown Third Ward, Magnolia T.C. rider
Ol' ignorant ass always stuntin'

Niggas at the second line be sayin, I'll be damned
Up in they best fits sayin', Juve got me again

If it cost less than twenty it don't look right on me
I stay flossed out all through the week
My money long if you don't know I'm the B.G
I be fuckin niggas bitches all in they home
Niggas be like, ""Look at that Benz on all that chrome""
Diamonds worn by everybody thats in my click
Man I got the price of a mansion 'round my neck and wrist
My nigga Baby gettin' a special built machine
A Mercedes Benz Wagon 700 V14
I know you niggas can't believe that
I can't wait to see ya haters face when ya see that
Man look at that
Niggas wear shades just to stand on side of me
Hoes say take that chain off boy ya blindin' me
All day my phone ringin' bling bling bling
Can see my earring from a mile bling bling

[Chorus: Lil' Wayne]
Bling bling, every time I come around your city

388,Notorious B.I.G.,"[Intro: The Notorious B.I.G.]
(""Fuck all you hoes!"" Get a grip, motherfucker!)
Yeah, this album is dedicated
To all the teachers that told me I'd never amount to nothin'
To all the people that lived above the buildings that I was hustlin' in front of
Called the police on me when I was just tryin' to make some money to feed my daughter (it's all good)
And all the niggas in the struggle
You know what I'm sayin'? It's all good, baby baby

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed in Bambú, sippin' on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number, same hood, it's all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

[Chorus: Total & Puff Daddy]
You know very well (Yeah)
Who you are (Money, hoes and clothes)
Don't let 'em hold you down (Bankrolls, yeah, haha)
Reach for the stars (It's all good)
You had a goal (C'mon)
But not that many (It's all good)
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty (Check it)

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach
And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
The Moët and Alizé keep me pissy, girls used to diss me
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rapping stuff
I was too used to packing gats and stuff
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the East Coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Living life without fear
Puttin' five karats in my baby girl ear
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

[Chorus: Total & Puff Daddy]
You know very well (C'mon)
Who you are (Bankrolls)
Don't let 'em hold you down (Clothes)
Reach for the stars (Mansions)
You had a goal
But not that many (It's all good)
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty ('94)

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
When I was dead broke, man, I couldn't picture this
50-inch screen, money-green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is loungin'
Celebrating every day, no more public housin'
Thinkin' back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps an Ac' with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip Champagne when we thirsty
Uh, damn right I like the life I live
'Cause I went from negative to positive and it's all (It's all good, nigga)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

[Chorus: Total, The Notorious B.I.G. & Puff Daddy]
You know very well (Money)
Who you are (Hoes and clothes)
Don't let 'em hold you down (Bankrolls)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
Reach for the stars (That's right)
You had a goal (It's all good)
But not that many (All good)
'Cause you're the only one (East coast, represent)
I'll give you good and plenty (C'mon)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

Representin' B-Town in the house (Biggie Smalls)

This is the start of a mess, oh
I don't think we should pretend
That this is anything less than over

We can't be friends
We can't be friends

And I said what I said
I already told you
I don't wanna know you anymore
So get it through your head

Stop trying so hard
We're so much better apart
You can't just rip out my heart
And then just keep going on

And I said what I said

Said I'd never had an enemy
Swear I'll find a way to move along
You may as well erase my number

Found another you while you were gone

We can't be friends

And I said what I said
I already told you
I don't wanna know you anymore
So get it through your head

Midnight coming full thrust, and

The second hand rolling around (Na, na, na, na)
Hundred thousands deep, world wide press
Hate to be the man that gotta clean this mess
Same resolution, get the money
Ain't where we've been, it's where we gonna be
Get ready to hum Auld Lang Syne

Ringing it in, waiting for the ball to drop

May the future hold more joy then pain

To get away, get gone?

And you got away with a lot

So put away that meat you're selling

And I've done what I could for you
But you're not benefiting
And yet I'm sitting

If he won't get with this?
Am I gonna heal from this?
He won't admit to it

I gotta get him out

That he don't give a shit about me

Cause I do know what's good for me
And I've done what I could for you

Am I gonna heal from this?

That he don't give a shit about me

[Verse 2]
How many times can it escalate
Till it elevates to a place I can't breathe?
And I must decide, if you must deride
That I'm much obliged to up and go
I'll idealize, then realize
That it's no sacrifice because the price is paid
And there's nothing left to grieve
Fuckin' go

Cause I've done what I've could for you
And I do know what's good for me
And I'm not benefiting
Instead I'm sitting

How can I deal with this
If he won't get with this?
Am I gonna heal from this?

That he don't give a shit about me

So what I'm really tryna say is
And what I hope you understand
Is despite of all the imperfections of who I am
I still wanna be your man
I know it hasn't been easy for us to talk
With everyone being around but
It's just personal, this just, for me and you
And I want you to know that I still love you
And though the seasons may change
Sometimes love goes from sunshine to rain
I'm under this umbrella and I'm calling your name

And you know I don't wanna lose that, cause I still believe

[Verse 3]
I still believe in love, I still believe in us
I hope you believe in us, the way I believe in us, you don't see
Cause what you don't see is when we don't speak I really don't sleep, I wanna talk to you
And if I'd have the world in my hands I'd give it all to ya
I wanna know if you feeling, the way that I'm feeling
I wanna know if you feeling, the way that I'm, the way that I'm

You taught me to be careful with your heart, your heart, with your heart",Justin Bieber,2000,"[61, 66, 60]",3

Shouldn't worry if I'm there
Everybody at the party
Shouldn't worry what I wear
'Cause today they'll talk about us
And tomorrow they won't care

This whole life, is it a dream? I can't tell
I got up, then I waved, then I fell
I recall, you were all there with me
Overjoyed and at peace

And you don't give up
And you...

You'll be no harbor to the sorrow
Just let it go

Don't hang your head in sorrow
Don't give up just before you win
Don't wait around for tomorrow
Open up your arms and let it in

This gift will last forever
This gift will never let you down
Some things are made from better stuff
This gift is ready to be found
Just you believe it now

This gift will last forever
This gift will never let you down
Some things are made from better stuff
This gift is ready to be found
Your heart's in wide receiving
Been too long buried in the sand
Some things require believing
These things just fall right in your hand
Just try to understand

If you long enough
And you don't give up
If you're strong enough
And you don't give up [x2]",Glen Hansard,2000,"[79, 49, 53]",3
398,A Country Boy Can Survive (Y2K Version),"Computer man says it's the end of time
December 31st nineteen ninety-nine
People buyin' up Army surplus things
Afraid of what the New Year will bring

I live back in the woods you see
Y2K don't mean a thing to me
I've got a shotgun, a rifle
And a four wheel drive
A country boy can survive
Country folks can survive

I can plow a field all day long
I can catch catfish from dusk 'till dawn
Make our own whiskey
And our own smoke too
Ain't too many things these ol' boys can't do
[including Bocephus]

We grow good ol' tomatoes
And homemade wine
A country boy can survive
Country folks can survive

'Cause you can't starve us out
And you can't make us run
We'll survive in the millenium
We say grace
And we say ma'am
If you ain't into that we don't give a damn

We came from the West Virginia coal mines
And the rocky mountains and the western skies
If the bank machines crash
We'll be just fine
'Cause a country boy can survive

Country folks can survive

I had a good friend in New York City
He never called me Bocephus
Called me hillbilly
[really]

But he was killed by a man with a switchblade knife
For forty-three dollars my friend lost his life
Now this dude's gonna get out in a year or two
'Cause the system don't work for me and you
But a country boy can survive
Country folks can survive

'Cause you can't starve us out
And you can't make us run
We'll survive in the millenium

We say grace
And we say ma'am
If you ain't into that we don't give a damn

We're from North California
And south Alabam'
And little towns all around this land
If the bank machine's crash
We'll be just fine
And a country boy can survive

Country folks can survive
Country boy can survive
Country folks can survive

The greatest romance that's ever been sold

[Verse 1]
So what do to know, you and me
Finally face to face

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose

Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly-y

To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said, many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

Doc walk like Caine from Kung Fu 'round the globe
Throw obstacles I'll hurdle them
Herb and whack MC's
Drum racks to the rims, to the caps
Yo Methical, and D, I'm ASAP
I'm crack of dawn chicken hunting at KFC
In '83 I was that scrub TLC talked about
Now I rock the house, chalk 'em out

Yeah, no doubt
Who got the biggest ass in the house?
Young miss, fillet-of-fish, salt water trout
Pretty young thing, got a tongue ring and dirty mouth
And she whispering them sweet nothings, I air it out

Until she got high and went and fucked Potsie
Lady Godiva, from day one a dick rider
Liar, liar, set your pussy on fire

I see you dancing right now
I don't need to tell you that you know how

I won't steer you wrong

Feel the tender touch of your caress

This nigga lookin' like love
No doubt sophisticated thug keep me guessin'
Said it would be a blessin' just to watch you undressin'
Callin' you daddy, late nights I'm layin' on your chest and
Stay reminiscin' 'bout the rest and, and how they less than
Tryna come between what we share, can't compare (Never)
Could have been left, but when it's mine, I never share
Fight to the death if need be to prove that
Wounds from your wars, other bitches couldn't soothe that
Broke from a bad back, I'm holdin' you down
Doin' dirt with other bitches but them other fishes drown
Locked in, for however long, I'm playin' it smart
Court dates in other cities, there, I'm playin' my part
Wifey, in ya life see forever be us
Passenger side of a Bentley or the number 2 bus
Tell the whole world, papi, Eve don't want nobody else
With other niggas pick and choose, but you, I'm keepin' for myself

[Chorus]
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)

No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him

[Verse 2]
All my peoples thinkin' I'm delirious, but the love I feel is serious
Couples of the world, no comparing us
Been through fist fights with niggas when I see it escalate
I'm the getaway driver, so my nigga can escape
Pull my ice for the bail, spending nights in jail
Drawing hearts on the wall with our names around the cell
It may be a little craziness, maybe I'm blind
But for me to leave now, lookin' for love would take a lifetime
So I'm keepin' mine, fuckin' keep me blind
Feels like heaven when we makin' love, controllin' my spine
Wine and dine, I don't need that as long as long as you with me
And you bitches thinkin' that you competition, come and get me
My position is held, some try and all fail
Pussy piece a mothafucka, uh-huh, good enough to sell
Never leave his baby girl, mad 'cause he claim me
Only thug in the hood that was wild enough to tame me (C'mon)

[Chorus]
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him (Yeah)
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him (Yeah)

[Verse 3]
I'm the bitch he'll never leave, helped him build his luxuries
Carry stories that can hurt him, still he only trustin' me
Secrets never leave my mouth, even if they torture me
Always taught to hold the ground, that's why I'll always be his queen
Did some dumb shit, see him in the party, start to flip
Curse him out on the regular just to make him sick
Disappear for a day or two to test his loyal ground
Keep my dogs on a short leash, controllin' the growl
Open wide, I don't give a fuck, I'm swallowin' my pride
And he fast to blast a cat that he think be on the prowl
But I'll never let him go, temper flare, let it go
Always be his extra back bone, quick to let a nigga know
Always by his side, Eve the apple in his eye
Us together ain't no stopping snatchin' pieces of the pie
Us together in our own world, what's his becomes mine
Exceed eternity with him we'll stand the test of time (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever

Got babies by hustlers and niggas in jail
Slinging for chips and fiends with burnt finger tips
Base heads, killed cab drivers just for a hit
A week later, sporting Gators, getting thrills
Our honies wearing Gucci high heels
She come to scoop me, I chill
Leave the streets alone for a sec
Hit the sky bar on sunset, then the sex is so high-tech
Uh

[Chorus]
Nasty, Nas to Esco to Escobar
Now he is Nastradamus
Nasty, Nas to Esco to Escobar
Now he is Nastradamus
Nasty, Nas to Esco to Escobar
Now he is Nastradamus
Nasty, Nas to Esco to Escobar
Now he is Nastradamus

[Verse 3]
Now, lounge homeboy, you in the Godly zone
Rest in peace, Ill Will, now your name's on the throne
And we gon' rep it the best that we can
Physically, you was killed by the weapons of man
But where you at now, you lamp, laid and max now
Where Bravehearts put they rap down in honor of your name, you a legend
And they don't understand how you CEO from heaven
But that's another level, brethren
Two G's, we got the type fam with MAC-11's
We do squeeze, thought it's not right
But that's the zone that we left in
Bentleys, Porches, Piaget watches
Sick with the bread, Lamborghini trucks topless
Laptops with 100 gigabytes, ninja bikes
And we all roll dice, for each other's ice
And how does one guy multiply to more than five wise guys?
But only one man, only the mind's eye can understand that I'm...

[Chorus]
Nasty, Nas to Esco to Escobar
Now he is Nastradamus
Nasty, Nas to Esco to Escobar
Now he is Nastradamus
Nasty, Nas to Esco to Escobar
Now he is Nastradamus
Nasty, Nas to Esco to Escobar
Now he is Nastradamus
