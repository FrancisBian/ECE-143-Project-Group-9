Say you, say me
Say it for always, that's the way it should be
Say you, say me
Say it together, naturally

[Verse 1]
I had a dream, I had an awesome dream
People in the park playing games in the dark
And what they played was a masquerade
And from behind of walls of doubt a voice was crying out

[Chorus]
Say you, say me
Say it for always, that's the way it should be
Say you, say me
Say it together, naturally

[Verse 2]
As we go down life's lonesome highway
Seems the hardest thing to do is to find a friend or two
A helping hand - someone who understands
That when you feel you've lost your way
You've got someone there to say
I'll show you

[Chorus]
Say you, say me
Say it for always, that's the way it should be
Say you, say me
Say it together, naturally

[Bridge]
So you think you know the answers - oh no
Because the whole world has got you dancing, that's right
I'm telling you
It's time to start believing - oh yes
Believing who you are - you are a shining star

Say you, say me
Say it for always, that's the way it should be

2,Alive & Kicking,"[Verse One]
I was having a nice time out the night-time
You were digging a vice mine out of light lime
As if you had all the rights to make a sight
Locked in a gilded birdcage with a blurred name

[Chorus]
I could make my own wine
But I don't have time
Gentlemen are staring
I'm alive & kicking
Who knows what'll happen

[Verse Two]
Man & a woman in one & the auntie gone
I'm remarkable in long but I haven't shone
I see you have all the wrongs to sing this song
You're wanting me to chirrup with a big bong

I could make my own wine
But I don't have time
Gentlemen are staring
I'm alive & kicking
Who knows what'll happen

[Post-Chorus]
Insanity, you can't sell humanity
This is madness, getting me filled with sadness
Anti-social, not particularly vocal
This is stupid, say, who wanted to do this?

And I never thought I'd feel this way
And as far as I'm concerned

4,I Miss You,"[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you, I miss you

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Hello there
The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
Where are you?
And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on so haunting every time
And as I stare I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge and Mark Hoppus]
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge and Mark Hoppus]
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already

5,Small Town,"[Intro]
She in the city, but she from a small town
High heels, tall shots make her fall down
Up late, now she running with the fast crowd
But she calls me every night before she pass out

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna waste my time with girls who rolling they eyelids
Girls who lookin' for a place to stay
Because they came away from Long Island
I don't wanna make your mind up
I'm just tryna make you mine quick
But ever since I put you in my line-up
All I do is choke: Heimlich
Good girl in a bad dress
But ain't nothing really changed but your address
You in the Upper West Side
You were thinking other people
Would've never accepted all your assets?
But I'm Cashis and you cash poor
I'mma give you anything that you ask for
You a small town girl but you living in the city
So you always keep your heart near your passport

[Hook]
She in the city, but she from a small town
High heels, tall shots make her fall down
Up late, now she running with the fast crowd
But she calls me every night before she pass out
You ain't foolin' us
You from a small town
You ain't foolin' us
You from a small town

[Verse 2]
I don't know what's next for us
But every time I talk it's like I messed it up
People wanna tell me that I'm too honest
Walking on eggshells, two omelettes
And I know it's hard cause you left your town
Dad don't call like he let you down
You don't wanna talk when the sun is out
But if we get a little drunk, then it's all allowed
And the truth comes down, it's pouring, pouring
'Bout to drop bombs like Warren, Moon
Color of your skin be orange, orange
Aren't you the girl that I met last June?
Who was so damn fun man, where did she go?
On vacation, Puerto Rico
Grand Theft Auto in your heart like Niko
Trying to meet your mother like I'm Jason Segel

[Hook]
She in the city, but she from a small town
High heels, tall shots make her fall down
Up late, now she running with the fast crowd
But she calls me every night before she pass out
You ain't foolin' us
You from a small town
You ain't foolin' us
You from a small town

[Bridge]
I can take you anywhere on a map
I can make it all good
You can make me come back
You keep movin', I can find you on the map
I can take you back home
You can make me unpack
You in Atlanta, but you from a small town
You in Chicago, but you from a small town
You move to LA, but you from a small town
You live in Brooklyn but I know you from a small town

[Hook]
She in the city, but she from a small town
High heels, tall shots make her fall down
Up late, now she running with the fast crowd
But she calls me every night before she pass out
You ain't foolin' us
You from a small town
You ain't foolin' us
You from a small town

Yeah, all across the globe
In every town you know
Yeah, you ain't foolin' us",Hoodie Allen,1985,"[6, 9, 12, 14, 21, 25, 36, 42, 51]",9
6,Broken Wings,"[Hook]
I got broken wings
I keep dyin', keep tryin'
No, I won't give up
Oh I'm flyin', I'm flyin'
I got broken wings
I keep dyin', keep tryin'
No, I won't give up
Oh I'm flyin', I'm flyin'

[Verse 1]
I got broken wings, but I'm still flyin'
With a loss of faith, and I'm still tryin'
Got stereotype, radios turn me down
Cause I won't turn up on the mic
I'd rather rap about my life
And give advice to someone
Who's about to give up on life
That's real, and fuck how you feel
Independent, cause I don't need a deal
Picked up the mic and I put down the pills
Picked up the vibes
They don't care how you feel
Remember my Grandpa passed away
And it killed, my Dad
I saw life isn't promised, so i made a promise
That I'll pursuit my dreams
No matter how they feel
They said that I can't
Took out the T into a T
I killed it
Made sacrifices, always workin' O.T
When they call in, I will fill in
All eyes on me when
I decide to step in the buildin'
Fuck that radio music you listen to
I spit that real shit
In high school I was unpopular
Never fit in with the cool kids
They were busy partyin'
And makin' a bunch of excuses
I sat home, buildin' my craft
I had a dream, I'm pursuin'
It's hard to have these hopes and dreams
Especially when I got

[Hook]
I got broken wings
I keep dyin', keep tryin'
No, I won't give up
Oh I'm flyin', I'm flyin'

[Verse 2]
You don't have to relate to me
You don't have to have hate for me
You don't have words to say to me
You don't even have to pray for me
Do you
Cause I'll do me
Until the day that I'm through
'Remember back then
Back-stabbin' friends told me to not to
'Remember they said that if you need me then I got you
When I needed you most, you were a ghost
And you left me feelin' empty
And then I lost hope
You want me to fight, how can I cope
Slowly realizing my friends come and go
Findin' myself at the end of the road
I'm dyin' inside but live like I won't
The time is getting closer
And those beneath me are getting farther
Everyday I'm growin' older
I see that I'm not a part of society
They're eyeing me
Dyin' for me to fall apart
Cause I have a chance and they missed theirs
Cause I'm workin' harder
I was apart of the kids at school
Askin' why don't they like us
It's like we don't exist
We're there, but they do not mind us
I'm a little mental
It's okay to dream while you are mind fucked
Spreadin' both of my wings
I wanna fly but

[Hook]
I got broken wings
I keep dyin', keep tryin'
No, I won't give up
Oh I'm flyin', I'm flyin'
I got broken wings
I keep dyin', keep tryin'
No, I won't give up
Oh I'm flyin', I'm flyin'
I got broken wings
I keep dyin', keep tryin'
No, I won't give up
Oh I'm flyin', I'm flyin'
I got broken wings
I keep dyin', keep tryin'
No, I won't give up
Oh I'm flyin', I'm flyin'
I got broken wings
I keep dyin', keep tryin'
No, I won't give up

Sand in the hourglass
Never aligned

13,Perfect Way,"I took a backseat, a backhander, I took her back to her room
I better get back to the basics for you, oh yeah
You gotta conscience, compassion, you got a way with the word
You gotta heart full of complacency too

I don't have a purpose or mission, I'm empty by definition
I got a lack girl that you'd love to be
You wanna diva a deduction, you wanna do what they do
Wanna do damage that you can undo

Apart from everyone away from your love
A part of me belongs apart from all the hurt above

I got a perfect way to make a new proposition
I got a perfect way to make a justification
I got a perfect way to make a certain a maybe
I got a perfect way to make the girls go crazy

I took a day job amendment, I took a liking to you
I took a page out of my rulebook for you
You wanna message a confession, you wanna martyr me too
You wanna margin of error for two

Maybe tomorrow the next letter or when the weather gets better
I've got to wait here for your moon to turn blue
I made an offer, an exception, I made a sense out of you
You took a good look at your book but I knew

In times of tenderness in terms baby so true
Until such time as I can understand all the things you do

I got a perfect way to make a new proposition
I got a perfect way to make a justification
I got a perfect way to make a certain a maybe
I got a perfect way to make the girls go crazy

Want to forgive you for all the things that you do
Wanna forget how to remember with you
Maybe tomorrow the next letter or when the weather gets better
I've got to wait here for your moon to turn blue

Apart from everyone away from your love
A part of me belongs apart from all the hurt above

I got a perfect way to make a new proposition
I got a perfect way to make a justification

Is this a perfect way to make the girls go crazy

14,Burning Heart,"[Verse 1]
Two worlds collide, rival nations
It's a primitive clash venting years of frustrations
Bravely we hope against all hope
There is so much at stake
Seems our freedom's up against the ropes
Does the crowd understand?
Is it East versus West or man against man?
Can any nation stand alone?

[Chorus]
In the burning Heart just about to burst
There's a quest for answers an unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night rising like a spire
In the burning heart the unmistakable fire

[Verse 2]
In the warriors code there's no surrender
Though his body says stop his spirit cries - never!
Deep in our soul a quiet ember knows it's you against you
It's the paradox that drives us on
It's a battle of wills
In the heat of attack it's the passion that kills
The victory is yours alone

[Chorus] (x3)
In the burning Heart just about to burst
There's a quest for answers an unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night rising like a spire
In the burning heart the unmistakable fire

15,My Hometown,"I was eight years old and running with a dime in my hand
Into the bus stop to pick up a paper for my old man
I'd sit on his lap in that big old Buick
And steer as we drove through town
He'd tousle my hair and say ""Son, take a good look around
This is your hometown.""

This is your hometown
This is your hometown
This is your hometown

In '65 tension was running high at my high school
There was a lot of fights 'tween the black and white
There was nothing you could do
Two cars at a light on a Saturday night
In the back seat there was a gun
Words were passed, then a shotgun blast
Troubled times had come to my hometown

To my hometown
To my hometown
To my hometown

Now Main Street's whitewashed windows and vacant stores
Seems like there ain't nobody wants to come down here no more
They're closing down the textile mill across the railroad tracks
Foreman says ""These jobs are going, boys
And they ain't coming back
To your hometown.""

To your hometown
To your hometown
To your hometown

Last night me and Kate, we laid in bed
Talking about getting out
Packing up our bags maybe heading south
I'm thirty-five, we got a boy of our own now
Last night I sat him up behind the wheel, and said
""Son take a good look around
This is your hometown.""

16,Love Is The Seventh Wave,"(The Arch of Abundant Love)
In the empire of the senses
You're the queen of all you survey
All the cities all the nations
Everything that falls your way
There is a deeper wave than this
That you don't understand
There is a deeper wave than this
Tugging at your hand
Every ripple on the ocean
Every leaf on every tree
Every sand dune in the desert
Every power we never see
There is a deeper wave than this
Swelling in the world
There is a deeper wave than this
Listen to me girl
Feel it rising in the cities
Feel it sweeping over land
Over borders, over frontiers
Nothing will its power withstand
There is no deeper wave than this
Rising in the world
There is no deeper wave than this
Listen to me girl
All the bloodshed, all the anger
All the weapons, all the greed
All the armies, all the missiles
All the symbols of our fear
At the still point of destruction
At the centre of the fury
All the angels, all the devils
All around us, can't you see
There is a deeper wave than this
Rising in the land
There is a deeper wave than this
Nothing will withstand
(4x)
I say love is the seventh wave
I say love.....

17,Emergency,"[Verse 1]
How do you love someone, that's hurt so bad?
Even 911, ain't got a thing, to help them
How do you mend a wound that cuts straight through their heart?
And you can see everything that's left, just ain't enough

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we did some damage (I know)
Nobody else understands it (No, no)
Well baby, here's my shoulder you can lean on

In case of emergency
Emergency, emergency
In case of emergency

[Verse 2]
How do you love someone who sees the past?
But can't seem to change or keep repeating mistakes from wayback
How do you love someone, who sees the bad in everything?
Drinking from a half-empty glass, thinking suicidal
Only ones we hurt are ourselves and I don't know why

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we did some damage (I know)
Nobody else understands it (No, no)
Well baby, here's my shoulder you can lean on

Emergency, emergency
I'll be right there, in case of emergency

Butterflies
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you?

It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you

Is it right that you and I should fight
Every night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright
Very bright

If you want a boxer
I will step into the ring for you
And if you want a doctor
I'll examine every inch of you
If you want a driver
Climb inside
Or if you want to take me for a ride
You know you can
I'm your man

[Verse 3]
Ah, the moon's too bright
The chain's too tight
The beast won't go to sleep
I've been running through these promises to you
That I made and I could not keep
Ah but a man never got a woman back
Not by begging on his knees
Or I'd crawl to you baby
And I'd fall at your feet
And I'd howl at your beauty
Like a dog in heat
And I'd claw at your heart
And I'd tear at your sheet
I'd say please (Please)
I'm your man

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
And if you've got to sleep
A moment on the road
I will steer for you
And if you want to work the street alone
I'll disappear for you
If you want a father for your child
Or only want to walk with me a while
Across the sand
I'm your man

If you want a lover

21,Go Home,"I went walking again, I'll go out
And forget to tell any of my friends where I'm going
I'm just drunk on the side of the road in a ditch
When you find me – I wanna go home, but I'm sick
There's more whiskey than blood in my veins
More tar than air in my lungs; the strung out call I make
Burned down on the edge of the highway
""I'm sorry for asking, but please, come take me home""

I quit talking again but I know you're still listening
To see if I sleep or I pierce my skin
Needles to the worn-out rags
The folds in my arms, the sickening black
And I haven't been taking my meds
Lock all the cabinets and send me to bed
'Cause I know you're still worried I'm gonna get scared
'Cause I'm alone again and I don't like the things I see

And I haven't been taking my meds
So lock all the cabinets, and send me to bed
'Cause I know you're still worried I'm gonna get scared again
And make my insides clean with your kitchen bleach
But I've kissed enough bathroom sinks
To make up for the lovers that never loved me
And I know my body is just dirty clothes
I'm tired of washing my hands
God, I wanna go home",Julien Baker,1985,"[22, 26, 32, 44, 52, 67]",6

And your goats while you getting dogged

'Cause you never really got it
So when she threw it, yeah, you caught it
And I knew it but I bought it and Paul's just your puppy
Better keep him on your leash

Should've listened to Bugus, man, why did I not?
Because I, I really loved you
Oh, I, I really loved you
But you're a money hungry ho

There's only two things that you can't hide from
That's you and the ground you're walking on

Little white lies make the sidewalk cry
And you can betray with the things you say
Words won't last when you say 'em too fast
And you've been misled by the things you've said

You better watch what you do, what you do
'Cause the sidewalk talk can get carried away

Make your heart into a home

You can do it, uh huh

After every word there's a place that heard
Every time your shoe hits the avenue
And when you've gone they'll sing a song
Of the stories you told when you felt so bold
You better think twice when you cross the ice
Everything you do comes back to you
When you're shedding a tear, sidewalks will hear
When your laughter's true they'll run with you

Watch where you walk, 'cause the sidewalks talk

But power is a fickle mistress
The nature of power is that it belongs to no one
Until it is taken, seized, seized through sex, violence, gold

Uh, they say sex is a weapon, so when I shoot, meet your death in less than uh
Sex is a weapon, so when I shoot, meet your death in less than a second
Sex is a weapon, so when I shoot
I’m a sex shooter, I take aim and let it go
A dictator, the best ruler you’ ever know
So dominant that I promise to shake your confidence
I’ll sponsor you with scholarships, school you or got a doctorate
Assimilation, a necessity is the mother of invention
But lust is the father of innovation
Uh, they got together and raised a nation
Birth of civilization, first it hurt, then it was amazing

[Res - Hook]
Packing heat and taking aim
Ain’t no need, you know you gon’ get your way
Popping shit and spitting game
But there’s no need, you know you gon’ get your way

[Talib Kweli]
Submission is the mission when building and destroying
My methods they quite suggest that when I’m employing the quotas and joy
You can’t avoid this joyous, I’m such a …
The moisture that you deploying is taking us on voyage
I’m trying to find the spot, but you’re wetter than a tsunami
Shaping her like she paper, twistin’ like origami
Organically grown, never give orgasms to organisms with X chromosomes
Taking her home, good thing about her
She don’t know her power to eat a clam like it’s chowder
I’m bombing her lotus flower
She can’t fake it cause I know the face
She on top, because she know her place
See, your place ain’t the same as your position
Why you racing? It ain’t a competition
‘Cause you already been declared the winner
Now get up and prepare my dinner!

[Res]
Why you playing me like I'm a toy, oh daddy
You’ twistin’ my mind
But I’m a woman, and if there’s anything I know
I know sex is a weaṗon
And it can hurt you to the strongest degree
Deep down, you never forget her
You can have anything you want
Ain’t gotta get all like that boy
You can have it if you want it

Can you see - can you see - can you see
There's a woman right next to you

Sisters are doing it for themselves
Standing on their own two feet
And ringing on their own bells
Sisters are doing it for themselves

Now we ain't making stories
And we ain't laying plans
Cause a man still loves a woman
And a woman still loves a man
(Just the same though)

Sisters are doing it for themselves
Standing on their own two feet
And ringing on their own bells
Sisters are doing it for themselves

Thank you, I'll get it myself",Eurythmics,1985,"[42, 37, 24, 18, 24, 26, 31, 37, 39, 45, 62]",11
42,The Sun Always Shines on T.V.,"[Chorus]
Touch me, how can it be?
Believe me the sun always shines on TV
Hold me close to your heart
Touch me and give all your love to me, to me

[Verse 1]
I reached inside myself and found
Nothing there to ease the pressure of my ever worrying mind
All my powers waste away
I fear the crazed and lonely looks the mirror's sending me these days

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Please don't ask me to defend
The shameful lowlands of the way I'm drifting gloomily through time
I reached inside myself today
Thinking there's got to be some way to keep my troubles distant

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Hold me close to your heart
Touch me and give all your love to me
Your love to me",​a-ha,1985,"[43, 50, 55, 68, 79]",5
43,Living In America,"Verse 1:  Fresh Kid Ice

There's 8 million stories in every city
And Americans love to watch it on TV
There's gays, lesbians, stripper nymphos
Teenage prostitutes, husbands gone psycho
The haters hate it 'cause it's too hot for TV
But America rules, nasty as we wanna be
Always #1 across the land
So don't hate Jerry 'cause he's the man!
With more fight time than HBO
And even Don King should promote talk shows
It't the best thing in years to hit the TV
'Cause America's rowdy-rowdy like Master P
Players everywhere love a good talk show
'Cause the hoochies get naked like a 2 Live show
So always represent the American way:
Freedom of speech and always gettin' paid!

Chorus:
[Living in America!]
[Living in America!]  (All the time, station to station)
[Living in America!]  (Here to here, across the nation)
[Living in America!]  (Got to have a celebration)

Verse 2:  Brother Marquis

The ghetto got me caught up in some talk show shhhhh
Now I'm on TV to find that my girl was a trick
She did my main man, plus my own band
I had to take a stand and beat the trick bad
Two sisters, that were doin' the two brothers
Now they fight 'cause they was doin' each other
The girl posin' nude used to be a dude
Outcasted from the family, now they startin' a feud
The man cheatin' on his wife got caught last night
'Cause the girl he was kissin' was a transvestite
Got caught on TV where it's too late to fight
Now the whole world knows about his secret life
50-year-old mom, dressed him like a hoochie
The hoodrat pulls a gat on the groupie
Too hot for TV, too much for the movies
Some lady smacked Jerry, say what? Sue me!

Chorus

Bridge:

(Miami!  Atlanta G.A.!  Chicago!  And L.A.!
Houston!  And New York City!  And don't forget - Cincinnatti!)
[I live in America!]
[I live in America!]

Verse 3
[Kid Ice] No matter how you feel, the stories are real
Showin' the world how Americans feel
With home-grown topics and a final thought
They even got hoochies without their bras
Of all the talk shows he's the best by far ...
{Instrumental where there should be a verse}
So set your VCR's if you got to go
'Cause you're living in America with the Springer show!
[Marquis] At the sound of the bell that goes Aw Hell!
Another knock down, another video sale
All problems solved, all matters scarred
A girl got knocked out her chair upside the wall
More hair-pullin', nail-bitin' and people fightin'
I love this show because it's so excitin'
The people believe what they really see
On tabloid TV, even me!

Chorus

{JER-RY!! JER-RY!! JER-RY!! JER-RY!! JER-RY!! JER-RY!!

45,Life In A Northern Town,"A Salvation Army band played and the children drank lemonade
And the morning lasted all day, all day
And through an open window came like Sinatra in a younger day
Pushing the town away, away

Hey, ah, ma, ma, ma, into the night
Hey, ah, ma, ma, ma, hey, ah
Life in a northern town
Hey, ma, ma, ma, ma

They sat on the stony ground and he took a cigarette out
And everyone else came down to listen
It was the winter 1963, it felt like the world would freeze
With John F. Kennedy and the Beatles, yeah, yeah, yeah

Hey, ah, ma, ma, ma, into the night
Hey, ah, ma, ma, ma, hey, ah
Life in a northern town
Hey, ma, ma, ma, ma

Hey, ah, ma, ma, ma, into the night
Hey, ah, ma, ma, ma, hey, ah
They shut the factory down
Hey, ma, ma, ma, ma

The evening had turned to rain, watched the water roll down the drain
As they followed him down to the station
And he would never wave goodbye, you could see it written in his eyes
As the train pulled out of sight, bye, bye

Hey, ah, ma, ma, ma, into the night
Hey, ah, ma, ma, ma, hey, ah
Life in a northern town
Hey, ma ma ma, take it easy on yourself

46,You Belong To The City,"[Verse 1]
The sun goes down
The night rolls in
You can feel it
Starting all over again
The moon comes up
And the music calls
You're getting tired of
Staring at the same four walls
You're out of your room
And down on the street
Moving through the crowd
In the midnight heat
The traffic roars
The sirens scream
You look at the faces
It's just like a dream
Nobody knows where you're going
Nobody cares where you've been

[Chorus]
Cause you belong to the city
You belong to the night
Living in a river of darkness
Beneath the neon light
You were born in the city
Concrete under your feet
It's in your moves
It's in your blood
You're a man of the street

[Verse 2]
When you said goodbye
You were on the run
Trying to get away
From the things you've done
Now you're back again
And you're feeling strange
So much has happened
But nothing has changed
You still don't know
Where you're going
You're still just a face in the crowd

[Chorus]
Cause you belong to the city
You belong to the night
Living in a river of darkness
Beneath the neon light
You were born in the city
Concrete under your feet
It's in your moves
It's in your blood
You're a man of the street

[Bridge:]
You can feel it
You can taste it
You can see it
You can face it
You can hear it
You're getting near it
You wanna make it
Cause you can take it

(Alternate Chorus)
You belong to the city
You belong to the night
You belong to the city
You belong to the night
You belong

47,The Big Money,"[Verse 1]
Big money goes around the world
Big money underground
Big money got a mighty voice
Big money make no sound
Big money pull a million strings
Big money hold the prize
Big money weave a mighty web
Big money draw the flies

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Sometimes pushing people around
Sometimes pulling out the rug
Sometimes pushing all the buttons
Sometimes pulling out the plug

[Chorus]
It's the power and the glory
It's a war in paradise
It's a Cinderella story
On a tumble of the dice

[Verse 2]
Big money goes around the world
Big money take a cruise
Big money leave a mighty wake
Big money leave a bruise
Big money make a million dreams
Big money spin big deals
Big money make a mighty head
Big money spin big wheels

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Sometimes building ivory towers
Sometimes knocking castles down
Sometimes building you a stairway
Lock you underground
It's that old time religion
It's the kingdom they would rule
It's the fool on television
Getting paid to play the fool

[Chorus]
It's the power and the glory
It's a war in paradise
It's a Cinderella story
On a tumble of the dice

[Verse 3]
Big money goes around the world
Big money give and take
Big money done a power of good
Big money make mistakes
Big money got a heavy hand
Big money take control
Big money got a mean streak
Big money got no soul",Rush,1985,"[48, 51, 54, 61, 70, 73, 75, 93]",8
48,Do It For Love,"[Intro: Sara Bareilles]
There'll be girls across the nation that'll eat this up
Babe, I know that it's your soul, but could you bottle it up?
Get down to the heart of it, know it's my heart
You're shit out of your luck, don't make me tell you again, again, again

[Chorus: P-Holla & Sara Bareilles]
Woo!
L-l-l-love, l-l-l-love
Ayy, ayy, I do it for love
Uh-huh, yeah
What'cha do it for? What'cha do it for?
What'cha, what'cha do it for?

[Verse 1: P-Holla]
I do it for the love, yes I do
So you don't care about the money? Well, yes, it's true
And I'm so blessed to be fulfilling my destiny
All material things could mean less to me
Only thing I ever could need is a Sara B sample with a dope ass beat
And get the mic check (Check) are the levels right?
And if it's good then I'll be here for several nights
'Cause the only thing I need is a strong supporting team
The most important thing that helps supporting my dream
And I can't forget my family, helpin' keep my sanity
No matter what I do I know they'll always stand for me

Chorus: P-Holla & Sara Bareilles
L-l-l-love, l-l-l-love
I do it for love, I do it for love
No matter what I do, I know I'll always do it for love
I'll do it for love, I'll do it for love
What'cha do it for? What'cha do it for?
I'll do it for love

[Verse 2: P-Holla]
'Cause I can only do me that's all I know
Dodge the difficulties and take life slow
And if I ever slow up you know I'll always show up
It's still the same old me even-even if I blow up
Love is what I do it for, love is why I'm rapping
Love is the main reason for how all of this happened
Love for all my fans love for all the shows
Got love for all my memories no matter where I go
Even if I 'mount to nothin', I know there's always something
It's not a fitness test but it'll always keep me running
One good thing 'bout music: when it hits you feel no pain
So I keep it close to me make sure it never goes away
Uh, from the start I knew it in my heart
If I made one person happy then I know I did my part
Now if I stay into it and people dig the music
I put on for my cities and know I'll always do it for love

[Chorus: P-Holla & Sara Bareilles]
L-l-l-love, l-l-l-love
I do it for love, I do it for love
Yeah, put on for my cities, I know I'll always do it for love
I'll do it for love, I'll do it for love
What'cha do it for? (Uh-huh) What'cha do it for?
I'll do it for love

[Bridge: Sara Bareilles & P-Holla]
There'll be girls across the nation that'll eat this up
There'll be girls across the nation that'll eat this up
There'll be girls across the nation that'll eat this up
Babe, I know that it's your soul, but could you bottle it up?
I do it for love, no flashin', love is a game, no flashin'
Get down to the heart of it, know it's my heart
You're shit out of your luck, don't make me tell you again, love
I do it for love, no flashin', love is a game, no flashin'
Get down to the heart of it, know it's my heart
You're shit out of your luck, don't make me tell you again, love

I do it for love, I do it for love
Love is a game, no flashin', one in the same
I'll do it for love, I'll do it for love
Love is a game, no flashin', one in the same
I'll do it for love, I'll do it for love
I'd do it for love, love, love, love
I'd do it for love, love, love, love (Yeah)

50,To Live And Die In L.A.,"[Intro]
“Street Science, you’re on the air. What do you feel when you hear a record like 2Pac’s new one?”
“I love 2Pac’s new record.”
“Right, but don’t you feel like that creates tension between East and West? I mean, he’s talking about killing people, ‘I had sex with your wife’ — and not in those words. But he’s talking about, ‘I wanna see you deceased’…""

[Intro: 2Pac]
No Doubt
To live and die in L.A., California
What you say about Los Angeles?
Still the only place for me
It never rains in Southern California

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
To live and die in L.A
Where everyday we try to fatten our pockets
Us niggas hustle for the cash, so it's hard to knock it
Everybody got they own thing, currency chasin'
Worldwide through the hard times, worrying faces
Shed tears as we bury niggas close to heart
Who was a friend, now a ghost in the dark
Cold-hearted 'bout it, nigga got smoked by a fiend
Tryin' to floss on him, blind to a broken man's dream
A hard lesson, court cases keep me guessin'
Plea bargain ain't an option now, so I'm stressin'
Cost me more to be free than a life in the pen
Makin' money off of cuss words, writin' again
Learn how to think ahead, so I fight with my pen
Late night down sunset, likin' the scene
What's the worst they can do to a nigga?
Got me lost in Hell, to live and die in L.A. on bail

[Chorus: Val Young & 2Pac]
My angel sing
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
And the angels go
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
To live and die in L.A
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
It's the city of angels and constant danger
South Central L.A. can't get no stranger
Full of drama like a soap opera, on the curb
Watchin' the ghetto bird helicopters, I observe
So many niggas gettin' three strikes, tossed in jail
I swear, the pen right across from hell
I can't cry, ‘cause it's on now
I'm just a nigga on his own now
Livin' life thug style, so I can't smile
Writing to my peoples when they ask for pictures
Thinkin' Cali just fun and bitches
Better learn about the dress code, B's and C's
All them other niggas copycats, these is G's
I love Cali like I love women
‘Cause every nigga in L.A. got a little bit of thug in him
We might fight amongst each other
But I promise you this: we'll burn this bitch down
Get us pissed, to live and die in L.A

[Chorus: Val Young & 2Pac]
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
Let my angels sing
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
And my angels go
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
To live and die in L.A
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
It wouldn't be L.A. without Mexicans
Black love, brown pride, and the sets again
Pete Wilson tryin' to see us all broke
I'm on some bullshit out for everything they owe
Remember KDAY? Weekends, Crenshaw, MLK?
Automatics rang free, niggas lost they way
Gang signs being shown, nigga, love your hood
But recognize and it's all good
Where the weed at? Niggas gettin' shermed out
Snoop Dogg in this mothafucka burned out
M.O.B., Big Suge in the Lo-Lo, bounce and turn
Dogg Pound in the Lex with a ounce to burn
Got them Watts niggas with me, O.F.T.B
They got some hash, took the stash, left the rest for me
Neckbone, Tray, Heron, Buntry too
Big Rock got knocked, but this one's for you
I hit the studio and drop a jewel, hopin' it pay
Gettin' high, watchin' time fly; to live and die in L.A

[Chorus: Val Young & 2Pac]
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
Let my angel sing
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
And my angels go
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
To live and die in L.A
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
Let my angel sing

[Outro: 2Pac]
This go out for 92.3 and 106
All the radio stations that be bumpin' my shit
Makin' my shit sells quatruple quitraple platinum

All the real motherfuckers

51,Silent Running (On Dangerous Ground),"[Verse 1]
Take the children and yourself
And hide out in the cellar
By now the fighting will be close at hand
Don't believe the church and state
And everything they tell you
Believe in me, I'm with the high command

[Chorus]
Can you hear me, can you hear me running?
Can you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?
Can you hear me, can you hear me running?
Can you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?

[Verse 2]
There's a gun and ammunition
Just inside the doorway
Use it only in emergency
Better you should pray to God
The Father and the Spirit
Will guide you and protect from up here

[Chorus]
Can you hear me, can you hear me running?
Can you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?
Can you hear me, can you hear me running?
Can you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?

[Bridge]
Swear allegiance to the flag
Whatever flag they offer
Never hint at what you really feel
Teach the children quietly
For some day sons and daughters
Will rise up and fight while we stood still

[Chorus]
Can you hear me, can you hear me running?
Can you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?
Can you hear me, can you hear me running?
Can you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?

Can you hear me running (can you hear me calling you?)
(Can you hear me) hear me calling you?
(Can you hear me running) hear me running babe?

""Just a feeling I've got. Like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. 
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; 
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances.""
""You are just what the doc ordered.""

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot

[Verse 1]
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody wants the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got

[Verse 2]
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!""—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard

[Verse 3]
So you'll be Thor, I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?!
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?",Eminem,1985,"[53, 63, 71, 86]",4

Ooh... Ooh... Ooh...

Are you ready for the time of your life
It's time to stand up and fight
(It's alright) it's alright (It's alright, it's alright)
Hand in hand we'll take a caravan
To the motherland

One by one we're gonna stand with the pride
One that can't be denied
(Stand up, stand up, stand up)
From the highest mountain, and valley low
Well join together with hearts of gold

Now the children of the world can see
There's a better way for us to be
The place where mankind is born is so neglected and torn...
Torn apart

Join the caravan of love

Everybody take a stand
Join the caravan of love

I'm your brother
I'm your brother, don't you know
I'm your brother
I'm your brother, don't you know

We'll be living in a world of peace
In a day when everyone is free
We'll bring the young and the old
Won't you let your love flow from your heart

Every woman, every man

67,Head Over Heels,"[Verse 1]
I've been around for 20 some odd years
I learned a thing or two about love
Relationship after relationship
Both sides givin' up
I'm not a man that's gonna settle for less
And I don't wanna be divorced
I want a love different than all the rest
I want a girl worth fightin' for
But I guess one day we'll see

[Chorus]
But if it ain't that head over heels got my nose wide open
Kiss me through the phone babe, high school jokin'
You hang up, no you hang up, all I know is
If it ain't that kind of love then I don't want it
Head over heels got my nose wide open
Kiss me through the phone babe, high school jokin'
You hang up, no you hang up, all I know is
If it ain't that kind of love then I don't want it
Yeah, I don't want it, if it ain't that kind of love

[Verse 2]
Longin' on are my young buck days
Some childish things, I'm puttin' those away
I've seen a love in my mind that I'm tryin' to find
So I'm not wasting time on
Anything less than a love that's real

And I don't care how long it takes

Every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes, I am
So every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I should take it slow
Here I go, here I go, here I go

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Off again, there he go, to another dimension, my mind
Body, soul imprisoned, my eye probably goin' ballistic, but, listen
I'm missin' a couple of screws, they ain't never do drillin' true
You been sippin' away at the truth, a double shot of wisdom'll do
Do, do, rollin' through, hittin' switches
Rolling ditches, blowin' kisses, to the bitches, holdin' biscuits
What's the business? Beat the system
Co-defendants, blow the sentence, go to prison
Go to church and pray the father, Lord forgive us (Amen)
And only God can judge me (Yeah)
And he don't like no ugly
I look so fuckin' good, most dykes'll fuck me, buddy
Yeah, I'm a piece of shit, I know I plead the fifth
I tell her, ""Holler if ya need some dick""
The devotion is gettin' hopeless, but, hold it, I'm gettin' close
As my soul is, I'm seein' ghosts, a solo is now a poet
Hypnosis overdose on potions, adjustin' to the motions
And gettin' out all my emotions

Every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes, I am

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, this type of shit
Make a nigga wanna flip September through August
This type of shit got 'em bustin' out the clip
In the middle of the office
And a message to the bosses
The Misfits' new outfit is on the bloglist
Gorgeous hoes keep on the sayin' that they 'caused it
'Cause the Porsches get 'em nauseous
Plus I ain't even mad yet, niggas caught me in a good mood
Paparazzi wanna nag a nigga chillin' at the bag check
Hope they show me in my good shoes
When papa got the brand new bag
Flacko got the brand new Raf, that's good news
""Hood dudes usually don't look like you""
How it feel to get a deal and come back
And the whole hood look like you?
Screamin', ""Pimp Squad, hold it down!""
Can't drive, bitch, I'm legally blind, bitch
If I live or die, it's up to me to decide
Shit, niggas coppin' guns like they legal to buy
The only key to survive and get a piece of the pie
Is to agree with a lot or just believe a façade, bitch
And I'll be fine just-a drinkin' my wine, bitch

[Bridge: Miguel]
I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more
I'll be fine, sippin' wine

I'll be fine, sippin' wine

So every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes, I am

When I wanna lay here with her
And love her before I leave
And listen to the rain fall up on the roof
And the thunder sounds like horses hooves

And it makes me wanna wake her up
And tell her that I'm on fire

It looks like I'm gonna be late again
And I need to get up and get movin'
And I'm tryin'

The more I think about callin' in and lying here

When I wanna stay here with her
And watch her while she sleeps
And listen to the rain fall up on the roof
And the thunder sounds like horses hooves

[Chorus]
Oh I listen to her breathe
And it makes me wanna wake her up
And tell her that I'm on fire

And in the burning heat
Hanging on the edge of destruction

You can't stop the pain of your children crying out in your head
They always said that the living would envy the dead
So now you're gonna shoot
Shoot bullets of fire
Don't wanna fight
But sometimes you've got to
You're some soul survivor
And there's just one thing you've got to know:
You've got ten more thousand miles to go because you're
One of the living - and if you can't stick together
Well
You're one of the living - who's gonna make it tonight ?
Walk tall
Cool
Collected
But savage
Walk tall
Bruised
Sensual
Ravaged
It's ev'ry man for himself
Ev'ry woman
Ev'ry child
A new breed
Ferocious and wild
And all they wanna do is shoot bullets of fire
They wanna fight
But sometimes you've got to
You're some soul survivor
And there's just one thing you've got to know:
You've got ten more thousand miles to go because you're

Just fake it through the day and the night is your god
See you in battle, your boat is my paddle
Your life is my business, your plaque on my wall

Let your hair down, have one more round, drink 'til you believe it
Sloppy kisses, dirty wishes, baby, this is living
Roller coaster, up and down in random motion
Oh, come in closer, ditch your problems, better days are coming

Get up off the wall, come on, get down, get down
Give into the moment and live now, live now
Get up off the wall, come on, get down, get down
Give into the moment, feel it now

I have the heart of a coward
Here in my arms is exactly where I want you

Like you do, you do

All my dreams came true last night
All my hopes and fears
All my dreams came true once more
In tears, in tears

Be near me, be near
Be near me, be near
Be near

Never had that feeling
Until I first met you
Never felt like kneeling
Now I do, yes I do
Yes, I do, ooh

All my dreams came true last night
All my hopes and fears
All my dreams came true once more
In tears, in tears

Be near me, be near
Be near me, be near
Oh, be near me, be near
Be near, be near

The message is perfectly simple
The meaning is clear
Don't ever stray too far
And don't disappear
No, don't disappear

Be near me, be near
Be near me, be near
Be near me, be near

Be near me, be near

78,Secret Lovers,"[Verse 1: Mica Paris]
Here we are, the two of us together
Taking this crazy chance to be all alone
We both know that we should not be together
'Cause if they found out, it could mess up
Both our happy homes

[Verse 1: Alexander O'Neal]
I hate to think about us all meeting up together
'Cause soon as I looked at you, it would show on my face, yeah
Then they'll know that we've been loving each other
We can never no, no, no, no, we can't leave a trace

[Chorus:]
Secret lovers, yeah that's what we are
Trying so hard to hide the way we feel
'Cause we both belong to someone else
But we can't let it go 'cause we love each other so

[Verse 2: Mica Paris]
Sittin' at home I do nothing all day
But think about you and hope that you're okay
Hoping you'll call before anyone gets home
I'll wait anxiously alone by the phone

[Verse 2: Alexander O'Neal]
How could something so wrong be so right?
I wish we didn't have to keep our love out of sight, yeah
Living two lives, just ain't easy at all
But we gotta hang on and after fall

[Chorus:]
Secret lovers, yeah that's what we are
Trying so hard to hide the way we feel
'Cause we both belong to someone else
But we can't let it go 'cause what we feel is real
So real, so real, so real, oh so real

We gotta keep this on the down low
We don't want nobody to know
You know what I'm sayin'?
I know that's right!",Alexander O’Neal,1985,[80],1
79,I Knew The Bride (When She Use To Rock And Roll),"I want a hero: an uncommon want,
When every year and month sends forth a new one,
Till, after cloying the gazettes with cant,
The age discovers he is not the true one;
Of such as these I should not care to vaunt,
I'll therefore take our ancient friend Don Juan—
We all have seen him, in the pantomime,
Sent to the devil somewhat ere his time.

Vernon, the butcher Cumberland, Wolfe, Hawke,
Prince Ferdinand, Granby, Burgoyne, Keppel, Howe,
Evil and good, have had their tithe of talk,
And fill'd their sign posts then, like Wellesley now;
Each in their turn like Banquo's monarchs stalk,
Followers of fame, 'nine farrow' of that sow :
France, too, had Buonaparte and Dumourier
Recorded in the Moniteur and Courier.

Barnave, Brissot, Condorcet, Mirabeau,
Petion, Clootz, Danton, Marat, La Fayette,
Were French, and famous people, as we know:
And there were others, scarce forgotten yet,
Joubert, Hoche, Marceau, Lannes, Desaix, Moreau,
With many of the military set,
Exceedingly remarkable at times,
But not at all adapted to my rhymes.

Nelson was once Britannia's god of war,
And still should be so, but the tide is turn'd;
There 's no more to be said of Trafalgar,
'T is with our hero quietly inurn'd;
Because the army 's grown more popular,
At which the naval people are concern'd;
Besides, the prince is all for the land-service,
Forgetting Duncan, Nelson, Howe, and Jervis.

Brave men were living before Agamemnon
And since, exceeding valorous and sage,
A good deal like him too, though quite the same none;
But then they shone not on the poet's page,
And so have been forgotten:—I condemn none,
But can't find any in the present age
Fit for my poem (that is, for my new one);
So, as I said, I 'll take my friend Don Juan.

Most epic poets plunge 'in medias res'
(Horace makes this the heroic turnpike road),
And then your hero tells, whene'er you please,
What went before—by way of episode,
While seated after dinner at his ease,
Beside his mistress in some soft abode,
Palace, or garden, paradise, or cavern,
Which serves the happy couple for a tavern.

That is the usual method, but not mine—
My way is to begin with the beginning;
The regularity of my design
Forbids all wandering as the worst of sinning,
And therefore I shall open with a line
(Although it cost me half an hour in spinning)
Narrating somewhat of Don Juan's father,
And also of his mother, if you 'd rather.

In Seville was he born, a pleasant city,
Famous for oranges and women—he
Who has not seen it will be much to pity,
So says the proverb—and I quite agree;
Of all the Spanish towns is none more pretty,
Cadiz perhaps—but that you soon may see;
Don Juan's parents lived beside the river,
A noble stream, and call'd the Guadalquivir.

His father's name was Jose—Don, of course,—
A true Hidalgo, free from every stain
Of Moor or Hebrew blood, he traced his source
Through the most Gothic gentlemen of Spain;
A better cavalier ne'er mounted horse,
Or, being mounted, e'er got down again,
Than Jose, who begot our hero, who
Begot—but that 's to come—Well, to renew:

His mother was a learned lady, famed
For every branch of every science known
In every Christian language ever named,
With virtues equall'd by her wit alone,
She made the cleverest people quite ashamed,
And even the good with inward envy groan,
Finding themselves so very much exceeded
In their own way by all the things that she did.

Her memory was a mine: she knew by heart
All Calderon and greater part of Lope,
So that if any actor miss'd his part
She could have served him for the prompter's copy;
For her Feinagle's were an useless art,
And he himself obliged to shut up shop—he
Could never make a memory so fine as
That which adorn'd the brain of Donna Inez.

Her favourite science was the mathematical,
Her noblest virtue was her magnanimity,
Her wit (she sometimes tried at wit) was Attic all,
Her serious sayings darken'd to sublimity;
In short, in all things she was fairly what I call
A prodigy—her morning dress was dimity,
Her evening silk, or, in the summer, muslin,
And other stuffs, with which I won't stay puzzling.

She knew the Latin—that is, 'the Lord's prayer,'
And Greek—the alphabet—I 'm nearly sure;
She read some French romances here and there,
Although her mode of speaking was not pure;
For native Spanish she had no great care,
At least her conversation was obscure;
Her thoughts were theorems, her words a problem,
As if she deem'd that mystery would ennoble 'em.

She liked the English and the Hebrew tongue,
And said there was analogy between 'em;
She proved it somehow out of sacred song,
But I must leave the proofs to those who 've seen 'em;
But this I heard her say, and can't be wrong
And all may think which way their judgments lean 'em,
''T is strange—the Hebrew noun which means ""I am,""
The English always use to govern d--n.'

Some women use their tongues—she look'd a lecture,
Each eye a sermon, and her brow a homily,
An all-in-all sufficient self-director,
Like the lamented late Sir Samuel Romilly,
The Law's expounder, and the State's corrector,
Whose suicide was almost an anomaly—
One sad example more, that 'All is vanity'
(The jury brought their verdict in 'Insanity').

In short, she was a walking calculation,
Miss Edgeworth's novels stepping from their covers,
Or Mrs. Trimmer's books on education,
Or 'Coelebs' Wife' set out in quest of lovers,
Morality's prim personification,
In which not Envy's self a flaw discovers;
To others' share let 'female errors fall,'
For she had not even one—the worst of all.

O! she was perfect past all parallel—
Of any modern female saint's comparison;
So far above the cunning powers of hell,
Her guardian angel had given up his garrison;
Even her minutest motions went as well
As those of the best time-piece made by Harrison:
In virtues nothing earthly could surpass her,
Save thine 'incomparable oil,' Macassar!

Perfect she was, but as perfection is
Insipid in this naughty world of ours,
Where our first parents never learn'd to kiss
Till they were exiled from their earlier bowers,
Where all was peace, and innocence, and bliss
(I wonder how they got through the twelve hours),
Don Jose, like a lineal son of Eve,
Went plucking various fruit without her leave.

He was a mortal of the careless kind,
With no great love for learning, or the learn'd,
Who chose to go where'er he had a mind,
And never dream'd his lady was concern'd;
The world, as usual, wickedly inclined
To see a kingdom or a house o'erturn'd,
Whisper'd he had a mistress, some said two—
But for domestic quarrels one will do.

Now Donna Inez had, with all her merit,
A great opinion of her own good qualities;
Neglect, indeed, requires a saint to bear it,
And such, indeed, she was in her moralities;
But then she had a devil of a spirit,
And sometimes mix'd up fancies with realities,
And let few opportunities escape
Of getting her liege lord into a scrape.

This was an easy matter with a man
Oft in the wrong, and never on his guard;
And even the wisest, do the best they can,
Have moments, hours, and days, so unprepared,
That you might 'brain them with their lady's fan;'
And sometimes ladies hit exceeding hard,
And fans turn into falchions in fair hands,
And why and wherefore no one understands.

'T is pity learned virgins ever wed
With persons of no sort of education,
Or gentlemen, who, though well born and bred,
Grow tired of scientific conversation:
I don't choose to say much upon this head,
I'm a plain man, and in a single station,
But—Oh! ye lords of ladies intellectual,
Inform us truly, have they not hen-peck'd you all?

Don Jose and his lady quarrell'd—why,
Not any of the many could divine,
Though several thousand people chose to try,
'T was surely no concern of theirs nor mine;
I loathe that low vice—curiosity;
But if there 's anything in which I shine,
'T is in arranging all my friends' affairs,
Not having of my own domestic cares.

And so I interfered, and with the best
Intentions, but their treatment was not kind;
I think the foolish people were possess'd,
For neither of them could I ever find,
Although their porter afterwards confess'd—
But that 's no matter, and the worst 's behind,
For little Juan o'er me threw, down stairs,
A pail of housemaid's water unawares.

A little curly-headed, good-for-nothing,
And mischief-making monkey from his birth;
His parents ne'er agreed except in doting
Upon the most unquiet imp on earth;
Instead of quarrelling, had they been but both in
Their senses, they 'd have sent young master forth
To school, or had him soundly whipp'd at home,
To teach him manners for the time to come.

Don Jose and the Donna Inez led
For some time an unhappy sort of life,
Wishing each other, not divorced, but dead;
They lived respectably as man and wife,
Their conduct was exceedingly well-bred,
And gave no outward signs of inward strife,
Until at length the smother'd fire broke out,
And put the business past all kind of doubt.

For Inez call'd some druggists and physicians,
And tried to prove her loving lord was mad;
But as he had some lucid intermissions,
She next decided he was only bad;
Yet when they ask'd her for her depositions,
No sort of explanation could be had,
Save that her duty both to man and God
Required this conduct—which seem'd very odd.

She kept a journal, where his faults were noted,
And open'd certain trunks of books and letters,
All which might, if occasion served, be quoted;
And then she had all Seville for abettors,
Besides her good old grandmother (who doted);
The hearers of her case became repeaters,
Then advocates, inquisitors, and judges,
Some for amusement, others for old grudges.

And then this best and weakest woman bore
With such serenity her husband's woes,
Just as the Spartan ladies did of yore,
Who saw their spouses kill'd, and nobly chose
Never to say a word about them more—
Calmly she heard each calumny that rose,
And saw his agonies with such sublimity,
That all the world exclaim'd, 'What magnanimity!'

No doubt this patience, when the world is damning us,
Is philosophic in our former friends;
'T is also pleasant to be deem'd magnanimous,
The more so in obtaining our own ends;
And what the lawyers call a 'malus animus'
Conduct like this by no means comprehends;
Revenge in person 's certainly no virtue,
But then 't is not my fault, if others hurt you.

And if your quarrels should rip up old stories,
And help them with a lie or two additional,
I 'm not to blame, as you well know—no more is
Any one else—they were become traditional;
Besides, their resurrection aids our glories
By contrast, which is what we just were wishing all:
And science profits by this resurrection—
Dead scandals form good subjects for dissection.

Their friends had tried at reconciliation,
Then their relations, who made matters worse.
('T were hard to tell upon a like occasion
To whom it may be best to have recourse—
I can't say much for friend or yet relation):
The lawyers did their utmost for divorce,
But scarce a fee was paid on either side
Before, unluckily, Don Jose died.

He died: and most unluckily, because,
According to all hints I could collect
From counsel learned in those kinds of laws
(Although their talk 's obscure and circumspect),
His death contrived to spoil a charming cause;
A thousand pities also with respect
To public feeling, which on this occasion
Was manifested in a great sensation.

But, ah! he died; and buried with him lay
The public feeling and the lawyers' fees:
His house was sold, his servants sent away,
A Jew took one of his two mistresses,
A priest the other—at least so they say:
I ask'd the doctors after his disease—
He died of the slow fever call'd the tertian,
And left his widow to her own aversion.

Yet Jose was an honourable man,
That I must say who knew him very well;
Therefore his frailties I 'll no further scan
Indeed there were not many more to tell;
And if his passions now and then outran
Discretion, and were not so peaceable
As Numa's (who was also named Pompilius),
He had been ill brought up, and was born bilious.

Whate'er might be his worthlessness or worth,
Poor fellow! he had many things to wound him.
Let 's own—since it can do no good on earth—
It was a trying moment that which found him
Standing alone beside his desolate hearth,
Where all his household gods lay shiver'd round him:
No choice was left his feelings or his pride,
Save death or Doctors' Commons—so he died.

Dying intestate, Juan was sole heir
To a chancery suit, and messuages, and lands,
Which, with a long minority and care,
Promised to turn out well in proper hands:
Inez became sole guardian, which was fair,
And answer'd but to nature's just demands;
An only son left with an only mother
Is brought up much more wisely than another.

Sagest of women, even of widows, she
Resolved that Juan should be quite a paragon,
And worthy of the noblest pedigree
(His sire was of Castile, his dam from Aragon):
Then for accomplishments of chivalry,
In case our lord the king should go to war again,
He learn'd the arts of riding, fencing, gunnery,
And how to scale a fortress—or a nunnery.

But that which Donna Inez most desired,
And saw into herself each day before all
The learned tutors whom for him she hired,
Was, that his breeding should be strictly moral;
Much into all his studies she inquired,
And so they were submitted first to her, all,
Arts, sciences, no branch was made a mystery
To Juan's eyes, excepting natural history.

The languages, especially the dead,
The sciences, and most of all the abstruse,
The arts, at least all such as could be said
To be the most remote from common use,
In all these he was much and deeply read;
But not a page of any thing that 's loose,
Or hints continuation of the species,
Was ever suffer'd, lest he should grow vicious.

His classic studies made a little puzzle,
Because of filthy loves of gods and goddesses,
Who in the earlier ages raised a bustle,
But never put on pantaloons or bodices;
His reverend tutors had at times a tussle,
And for their Aeneids, Iliads, and Odysseys,
Were forced to make an odd sort of apology,
For Donna Inez dreaded the Mythology.

Ovid 's a rake, as half his verses show him,
Anacreon's morals are a still worse sample,
Catullus scarcely has a decent poem,
I don't think Sappho's Ode a good example,
Although Longinus tells us there is no hymn
Where the sublime soars forth on wings more ample:
But Virgil's songs are pure, except that horrid one
Beginning with 'Formosum Pastor Corydon.'

Lucretius' irreligion is too strong,
For early stomachs, to prove wholesome food;
I can't help thinking Juvenal was wrong,
Although no doubt his real intent was good,
For speaking out so plainly in his song,
So much indeed as to be downright rude;
And then what proper person can be partial
To all those nauseous epigrams of Martial?

Juan was taught from out the best edition,
Expurgated by learned men, who place
Judiciously, from out the schoolboy's vision,
The grosser parts; but, fearful to deface
Too much their modest bard by this omission,
And pitying sore his mutilated case,
They only add them all in an appendix,
Which saves, in fact, the trouble of an index;

For there we have them all 'at one fell swoop,'
Instead of being scatter'd through the Pages;
They stand forth marshall'd in a handsome troop,
To meet the ingenuous youth of future ages,
Till some less rigid editor shall stoop
To call them back into their separate cages,
Instead of standing staring all together,
Like garden gods—and not so decent either.

The Missal too (it was the family Missal)
Was ornamented in a sort of way
Which ancient mass-books often are, and this all
Kinds of grotesques illumined; and how they,
Who saw those figures on the margin kiss all,
Could turn their optics to the text and pray,
Is more than I know—But Don Juan's mother
Kept this herself, and gave her son another.

Sermons he read, and lectures he endured,
And homilies, and lives of all the saints;
To Jerome and to Chrysostom inured,
He did not take such studies for restraints;
But how faith is acquired, and then ensured,
So well not one of the aforesaid paints
As Saint Augustine in his fine Confessions,
Which make the reader envy his transgressions.

This, too, was a seal'd book to little Juan—
I can't but say that his mamma was right,
If such an education was the true one.
She scarcely trusted him from out her sight;
Her maids were old, and if she took a new one,
You might be sure she was a perfect fright;
She did this during even her husband's life—
I recommend as much to every wife.

Young Juan wax'd in goodliness and grace;
At six a charming child, and at eleven
With all the promise of as fine a face
As e'er to man's maturer growth was given:
He studied steadily, and grew apace,
And seem'd, at least, in the right road to heaven,
For half his days were pass'd at church, the other
Between his tutors, confessor, and mother.

At six, I said, he was a charming child,
At twelve he was a fine, but quiet boy;
Although in infancy a little wild,
They tamed him down amongst them: to destroy
His natural spirit not in vain they toil'd,
At least it seem'd so; and his mother's joy
Was to declare how sage, and still, and steady,
Her young philosopher was grown already.

I had my doubts, perhaps I have them still,
But what I say is neither here nor there:
I knew his father well, and have some skill
In character—but it would not be fair
From sire to son to augur good or ill:
He and his wife were an ill-sorted pair—
But scandal 's my aversion—I protest
Against all evil speaking, even in jest.

For my part I say nothing—nothing—but
This I will say—my reasons are my own—
That if I had an only son to put
To school (as God be praised that I have none),
'T is not with Donna Inez I would shut
Him up to learn his catechism alone,
No—no—I 'd send him out betimes to college,
For there it was I pick'd up my own knowledge.

For there one learns—'t is not for me to boast,
Though I acquired—but I pass over that,
As well as all the Greek I since have lost:
I say that there 's the place—but 'Verbum sat.'
I think I pick'd up too, as well as most,
Knowledge of matters—but no matter what—
I never married—but, I think, I know
That sons should not be educated so.

Young Juan now was sixteen years of age,
Tall, handsome, slender, but well knit: he seem'd
Active, though not so sprightly, as a page;
And everybody but his mother deem'd
Him almost man; but she flew in a rage
And bit her lips (for else she might have scream'd)
If any said so, for to be precocious
Was in her eyes a thing the most atrocious.

Amongst her numerous acquaintance, all
Selected for discretion and devotion,
There was the Donna Julia, whom to call
Pretty were but to give a feeble notion
Of many charms in her as natural
As sweetness to the flower, or salt to ocean,
Her zone to Venus, or his bow to Cupid
(But this last simile is trite and stupid).

The darkness of her Oriental eye
Accorded with her Moorish origin
(Her blood was not all Spanish, by the by;
In Spain, you know, this is a sort of sin);
When proud Granada fell, and, forced to fly,
Boabdil wept, of Donna Julia's kin
Some went to Africa, some stay'd in Spain,
Her great-great-grandmamma chose to remain.

She married (I forget the pedigree)
With an Hidalgo, who transmitted down
His blood less noble than such blood should be;
At such alliances his sires would frown,
In that point so precise in each degree
That they bred in and in, as might be shown,
Marrying their cousins—nay, their aunts, and nieces,
Which always spoils the breed, if it increases.

This heathenish cross restored the breed again,
Ruin'd its blood, but much improved its flesh;
For from a root the ugliest in Old Spain
Sprung up a branch as beautiful as fresh;
The sons no more were short, the daughters plain:
But there 's a rumour which I fain would hush,
'T is said that Donna Julia's grandmamma
Produced her Don more heirs at love than law.

However this might be, the race went on
Improving still through every generation,
Until it centred in an only son,
Who left an only daughter; my narration
May have suggested that this single one
Could be but Julia (whom on this occasion
I shall have much to speak about), and she
Was married, charming, chaste, and twenty-three.

Her eye (I 'm very fond of handsome eyes)
Was large and dark, suppressing half its fire
Until she spoke, then through its soft disguise
Flash'd an expression more of pride than ire,
And love than either; and there would arise
A something in them which was not desire,
But would have been, perhaps, but for the soul
Which struggled through and chasten'd down the whole.

Her glossy hair was cluster'd o'er a brow
Bright with intelligence, and fair, and smooth;
Her eyebrow's shape was like th' aerial bow,
Her cheek all purple with the beam of youth,
Mounting at times to a transparent glow,
As if her veins ran lightning; she, in sooth,
Possess'd an air and grace by no means common:
Her stature tall—I hate a dumpy woman.

Wedded she was some years, and to a man
Of fifty, and such husbands are in plenty;
And yet, I think, instead of such a ONE
'T were better to have TWO of five-and-twenty,
Especially in countries near the sun:
And now I think on 't, 'mi vien in mente,'
Ladies even of the most uneasy virtue
Prefer a spouse whose age is short of thirty.

'T is a sad thing, I cannot choose but say,
And all the fault of that indecent sun,
Who cannot leave alone our helpless clay,
But will keep baking, broiling, burning on,
That howsoever people fast and pray,
The flesh is frail, and so the soul undone:
What men call gallantry, and gods adultery,
Is much more common where the climate 's sultry.

Happy the nations of the moral North!
Where all is virtue, and the winter season
Sends sin, without a rag on, shivering forth
('T was snow that brought St. Anthony to reason);
Where juries cast up what a wife is worth,
By laying whate'er sum in mulct they please on
The lover, who must pay a handsome price,
Because it is a marketable vice.

Alfonso was the name of Julia's lord,
A man well looking for his years, and who
Was neither much beloved nor yet abhorr'd:
They lived together, as most people do,
Suffering each other's foibles by accord,
And not exactly either one or two;
Yet he was jealous, though he did not show it,
For jealousy dislikes the world to know it.

Julia was—yet I never could see why—
With Donna Inez quite a favourite friend;
Between their tastes there was small sympathy,
For not a line had Julia ever penn'd:
Some people whisper but no doubt they lie,
For malice still imputes some private end,
That Inez had, ere Don Alfonso's marriage,
Forgot with him her very prudent carriage;

And that still keeping up the old connection,
Which time had lately render'd much more chaste,
She took his lady also in affection,
And certainly this course was much the best:
She flatter'd Julia with her sage protection,
And complimented Don Alfonso's taste;
And if she could not (who can?) silence scandal,
At least she left it a more slender handle.

I can't tell whether Julia saw the affair
With other people's eyes, or if her own
Discoveries made, but none could be aware
Of this, at least no symptom e'er was shown;
Perhaps she did not know, or did not care,
Indifferent from the first or callous grown:
I 'm really puzzled what to think or say,
She kept her counsel in so close a way.

Juan she saw, and, as a pretty child,
Caress'd him often—such a thing might be
Quite innocently done, and harmless styled,
When she had twenty years, and thirteen he;
But I am not so sure I should have smiled
When he was sixteen, Julia twenty-three;
These few short years make wondrous alterations,
Particularly amongst sun-burnt nations.

Whate'er the cause might be, they had become
Changed; for the dame grew distant, the youth shy,
Their looks cast down, their greetings almost dumb,
And much embarrassment in either eye;
There surely will be little doubt with some
That Donna Julia knew the reason why,
But as for Juan, he had no more notion
Than he who never saw the sea of ocean.

Yet Julia's very coldness still was kind,
And tremulously gentle her small hand
Withdrew itself from his, but left behind
A little pressure, thrilling, and so bland
And slight, so very slight, that to the mind
'T was but a doubt; but ne'er magician's wand
Wrought change with all Armida's fairy art
Like what this light touch left on Juan's heart.

And if she met him, though she smiled no more,
She look'd a sadness sweeter than her smile,
As if her heart had deeper thoughts in store
She must not own, but cherish'd more the while
For that compression in its burning core;
Even innocence itself has many a wile,
And will not dare to trust itself with truth,
And love is taught hypocrisy from youth.

But passion most dissembles, yet betrays
Even by its darkness; as the blackest sky
Foretells the heaviest tempest, it displays
Its workings through the vainly guarded eye,
And in whatever aspect it arrays
Itself, 't is still the same hypocrisy;
Coldness or anger, even disdain or hate,
Are masks it often wears, and still too late.

Then there were sighs, the deeper for suppression,
And stolen glances, sweeter for the theft,
And burning blushes, though for no transgression,
Tremblings when met, and restlessness when left;
All these are little preludes to possession,
Of which young passion cannot be bereft,
And merely tend to show how greatly love is
Embarrass'd at first starting with a novice.

Poor Julia's heart was in an awkward state;
She felt it going, and resolved to make
The noblest efforts for herself and mate,
For honour's, pride's, religion's, virtue's sake;
Her resolutions were most truly great,
And almost might have made a Tarquin quake:
She pray'd the Virgin Mary for her grace,
As being the best judge of a lady's case.

She vow'd she never would see Juan more,
And next day paid a visit to his mother,
And look'd extremely at the opening door,
Which, by the Virgin's grace, let in another;
Grateful she was, and yet a little sore—
Again it opens, it can be no other,
'T is surely Juan now—No! I 'm afraid
That night the Virgin was no further pray'd.

She now determined that a virtuous woman
Should rather face and overcome temptation,
That flight was base and dastardly, and no man
Should ever give her heart the least sensation;
That is to say, a thought beyond the common
Preference, that we must feel upon occasion
For people who are pleasanter than others,
But then they only seem so many brothers.

And even if by chance—and who can tell?
The devil 's so very sly—she should discover
That all within was not so very well,
And, if still free, that such or such a lover
Might please perhaps, a virtuous wife can quell
Such thoughts, and be the better when they 're over;
And if the man should ask, 't is but denial:
I recommend young ladies to make trial.

And then there are such things as love divine,
Bright and immaculate, unmix'd and pure,
Such as the angels think so very fine,
And matrons who would be no less secure,
Platonic, perfect, 'just such love as mine;'
Thus Julia said—and thought so, to be sure;
And so I 'd have her think, were I the man
On whom her reveries celestial ran.

Such love is innocent, and may exist
Between young persons without any danger.
A hand may first, and then a lip be kist;
For my part, to such doings I 'm a stranger,
But hear these freedoms form the utmost list
Of all o'er which such love may be a ranger:
If people go beyond, 't is quite a crime,
But not my fault—I tell them all in time.

Love, then, but love within its proper limits,
Was Julia's innocent determination
In young Don Juan's favour, and to him its
Exertion might be useful on occasion;
And, lighted at too pure a shrine to dim its
Ethereal lustre, with what sweet persuasion
He might be taught, by love and her together—
I really don't know what, nor Julia either.

Fraught with this fine intention, and well fenced
In mail of proof—her purity of soul—
She, for the future of her strength convinced.
And that her honour was a rock, or mole,
Exceeding sagely from that hour dispensed
With any kind of troublesome control;
But whether Julia to the task was equal
Is that which must be mention'd in the sequel.

Her plan she deem'd both innocent and feasible,
And, surely, with a stripling of sixteen
Not scandal's fangs could fix on much that 's seizable,
Or if they did so, satisfied to mean
Nothing but what was good, her breast was peaceable—
A quiet conscience makes one so serene!
Christians have burnt each other, quite persuaded
That all the Apostles would have done as they did.

And if in the mean time her husband died,
But Heaven forbid that such a thought should cross
Her brain, though in a dream! (and then she sigh'd)
Never could she survive that common loss;
But just suppose that moment should betide,
I only say suppose it—inter nos.
(This should be entre nous, for Julia thought
In French, but then the rhyme would go for naught.)

I only say suppose this supposition:
Juan being then grown up to man's estate
Would fully suit a widow of condition,
Even seven years hence it would not be too late;
And in the interim (to pursue this vision)
The mischief, after all, could not be great,
For he would learn the rudiments of love,
I mean the seraph way of those above.

So much for Julia. Now we 'll turn to Juan.
Poor little fellow! he had no idea
Of his own case, and never hit the true one;
In feelings quick as Ovid's Miss Medea,
He puzzled over what he found a new one,
But not as yet imagined it could be
Thing quite in course, and not at all alarming,
Which, with a little patience, might grow charming.

Silent and pensive, idle, restless, slow,
His home deserted for the lonely wood,
Tormented with a wound he could not know,
His, like all deep grief, plunged in solitude:
I 'm fond myself of solitude or so,
But then, I beg it may be understood,
By solitude I mean a sultan's, not
A hermit's, with a haram for a grot.

'Oh Love! in such a wilderness as this,
Where transport and security entwine,
Here is the empire of thy perfect bliss,
And here thou art a god indeed divine.'
The bard I quote from does not sing amiss,
With the exception of the second line,
For that same twining 'transport and security'
Are twisted to a phrase of some obscurity.

The poet meant, no doubt, and thus appeals
To the good sense and senses of mankind,
The very thing which every body feels,
As all have found on trial, or may find,
That no one likes to be disturb'd at meals
Or love.—I won't say more about 'entwined'
Or 'transport,' as we knew all that before,
But beg 'Security' will bolt the door.

Young Juan wander'd by the glassy brooks,
Thinking unutterable things; he threw
Himself at length within the leafy nooks
Where the wild branch of the cork forest grew;
There poets find materials for their books,
And every now and then we read them through,
So that their plan and prosody are eligible,
Unless, like Wordsworth, they prove unintelligible.

He, Juan (and not Wordsworth), so pursued
His self-communion with his own high soul,
Until his mighty heart, in its great mood,
Had mitigated part, though not the whole
Of its disease; he did the best he could
With things not very subject to control,
And turn'd, without perceiving his condition,
Like Coleridge, into a metaphysician.

He thought about himself, and the whole earth
Of man the wonderful, and of the stars,
And how the deuce they ever could have birth;
And then he thought of earthquakes, and of wars,
How many miles the moon might have in girth,
Of air-balloons, and of the many bars
To perfect knowledge of the boundless skies;—
And then he thought of Donna Julia's eyes.

In thoughts like these true wisdom may discern
Longings sublime, and aspirations high,
Which some are born with, but the most part learn
To plague themselves withal, they know not why:
'T was strange that one so young should thus concern
His brain about the action of the sky;
If you think 't was philosophy that this did,
I can't help thinking puberty assisted.

He pored upon the leaves, and on the flowers,
And heard a voice in all the winds; and then
He thought of wood-nymphs and immortal bowers,
And how the goddesses came down to men:
He miss'd the pathway, he forgot the hours,
And when he look'd upon his watch again,
He found how much old Time had been a winner—
He also found that he had lost his dinner.

Sometimes he turn'd to gaze upon his book,
Boscan, or Garcilasso;—by the wind
Even as the page is rustled while we look,
So by the poesy of his own mind
Over the mystic leaf his soul was shook,
As if 't were one whereon magicians bind
Their spells, and give them to the passing gale,
According to some good old woman's tale.

Thus would he while his lonely hours away
Dissatisfied, nor knowing what he wanted;
Nor glowing reverie, nor poet's lay,
Could yield his spirit that for which it panted,
A bosom whereon he his head might lay,
And hear the heart beat with the love it granted,
With—several other things, which I forget,
Or which, at least, I need not mention yet.

Those lonely walks, and lengthening reveries,
Could not escape the gentle Julia's eyes;
She saw that Juan was not at his ease;
But that which chiefly may, and must surprise,
Is, that the Donna Inez did not tease
Her only son with question or surmise:
Whether it was she did not see, or would not,
Or, like all very clever people, could not.

This may seem strange, but yet 't is very common;
For instance—gentlemen, whose ladies take
Leave to o'erstep the written rights of woman,
And break the—Which commandment is 't they break?
(I have forgot the number, and think no man
Should rashly quote, for fear of a mistake.)
I say, when these same gentlemen are jealous,
They make some blunder, which their ladies tell us.

A real husband always is suspicious,
But still no less suspects in the wrong place,
Jealous of some one who had no such wishes,
Or pandering blindly to his own disgrace,
By harbouring some dear friend extremely vicious;
The last indeed 's infallibly the case:
And when the spouse and friend are gone off wholly,
He wonders at their vice, and not his folly.

Thus parents also are at times short-sighted;
Though watchful as the lynx, they ne'er discover,
The while the wicked world beholds delighted,
Young Hopeful's mistress, or Miss Fanny's lover,
Till some confounded escapade has blighted
The plan of twenty years, and all is over;
And then the mother cries, the father swears,
And wonders why the devil he got heirs.

But Inez was so anxious, and so clear
Of sight, that I must think, on this occasion,
She had some other motive much more near
For leaving Juan to this new temptation;
But what that motive was, I sha'n't say here;
Perhaps to finish Juan's education,
Perhaps to open Don Alfonso's eyes,
In case he thought his wife too great a prize.

It was upon a day, a summer's day.—
Summer's indeed a very dangerous season,
And so is spring about the end of May;
The sun, no doubt, is the prevailing reason;
But whatsoe'er the cause is, one may say,
And stand convicted of more truth than treason,
That there are months which nature grows more merry in,—
March has its hares, and May must have its heroine.

'T was on a summer's day—the sixth of June:—
I like to be particular in dates,
Not only of the age, and year, but moon;
They are a sort of post-house, where the Fates
Change horses, making history change its tune,
Then spur away o'er empires and o'er states,
Leaving at last not much besides chronology,
Excepting the post-obits of theology.

'T was on the sixth of June, about the hour
Of half-past six—perhaps still nearer seven—
When Julia sate within as pretty a bower
As e'er held houri in that heathenish heaven
Described by Mahomet, and Anacreon Moore,
To whom the lyre and laurels have been given,
With all the trophies of triumphant song—
He won them well, and may he wear them long!

She sate, but not alone; I know not well
How this same interview had taken place,
And even if I knew, I should not tell—
People should hold their tongues in any case;
No matter how or why the thing befell,
But there were she and Juan, face to face—
When two such faces are so, 't would be wise,
But very difficult, to shut their eyes.

How beautiful she look'd! her conscious heart
Glow'd in her cheek, and yet she felt no wrong.
O Love! how perfect is thy mystic art,
Strengthening the weak, and trampling on the strong,
How self-deceitful is the sagest part
Of mortals whom thy lure hath led along—
The precipice she stood on was immense,
So was her creed in her own innocence.

She thought of her own strength, and Juan's youth,
And of the folly of all prudish fears,
Victorious virtue, and domestic truth,
And then of Don Alfonso's fifty years:
I wish these last had not occurr'd, in sooth,
Because that number rarely much endears,
And through all climes, the snowy and the sunny,
Sounds ill in love, whate'er it may in money.

When people say, 'I've told you fifty times,'
They mean to scold, and very often do;
When poets say, 'I've written fifty rhymes,'
They make you dread that they 'll recite them too;
In gangs of fifty, thieves commit their crimes;
At fifty love for love is rare, 't is true,
But then, no doubt, it equally as true is,
A good deal may be bought for fifty Louis.

Julia had honour, virtue, truth, and love,
For Don Alfonso; and she inly swore,
By all the vows below to powers above,
She never would disgrace the ring she wore,
Nor leave a wish which wisdom might reprove;
And while she ponder'd this, besides much more,
One hand on Juan's carelessly was thrown,
Quite by mistake—she thought it was her own;

Unconsciously she lean'd upon the other,
Which play'd within the tangles of her hair:
And to contend with thoughts she could not smother
She seem'd by the distraction of her air.
'T was surely very wrong in Juan's mother
To leave together this imprudent pair,
She who for many years had watch'd her son so—
I 'm very certain mine would not have done so.

The hand which still held Juan's, by degrees
Gently, but palpably confirm'd its grasp,
As if it said, 'Detain me, if you please;'
Yet there 's no doubt she only meant to clasp
His fingers with a pure Platonic squeeze:
She would have shrunk as from a toad, or asp,
Had she imagined such a thing could rouse
A feeling dangerous to a prudent spouse.

I cannot know what Juan thought of this,
But what he did, is much what you would do;
His young lip thank'd it with a grateful kiss,
And then, abash'd at its own joy, withdrew
In deep despair, lest he had done amiss,—
Love is so very timid when 't is new:
She blush'd, and frown'd not, but she strove to speak,
And held her tongue, her voice was grown so weak.

The sun set, and up rose the yellow moon:
The devil 's in the moon for mischief; they
Who call'd her CHASTE, methinks, began too soon
Their nomenclature; there is not a day,
The longest, not the twenty-first of June,
Sees half the business in a wicked way
On which three single hours of moonshine smile—
And then she looks so modest all the while.

There is a dangerous silence in that hour,
A stillness, which leaves room for the full soul
To open all itself, without the power
Of calling wholly back its self-control;
The silver light which, hallowing tree and tower,
Sheds beauty and deep softness o'er the whole,
Breathes also to the heart, and o'er it throws
A loving languor, which is not repose.

And Julia sate with Juan, half embraced
And half retiring from the glowing arm,
Which trembled like the bosom where 't was placed;
Yet still she must have thought there was no harm,
Or else 't were easy to withdraw her waist;
But then the situation had its charm,
And then—God knows what next—I can't go on;
I 'm almost sorry that I e'er begun.

O Plato! Plato! you have paved the way,
With your confounded fantasies, to more
Immoral conduct by the fancied sway
Your system feigns o'er the controulless core
Of human hearts, than all the long array
Of poets and romancers:—You 're a bore,
A charlatan, a coxcomb—and have been,
At best, no better than a go-between.

And Julia's voice was lost, except in sighs,
Until too late for useful conversation;
The tears were gushing from her gentle eyes,
I wish indeed they had not had occasion,
But who, alas! can love, and then be wise?
Not that remorse did not oppose temptation;
A little still she strove, and much repented
And whispering 'I will ne'er consent'—consented.

'T is said that Xerxes offer'd a reward
To those who could invent him a new pleasure:
Methinks the requisition 's rather hard,
And must have cost his majesty a treasure:
For my part, I 'm a moderate-minded bard,
Fond of a little love (which I call leisure);
I care not for new pleasures, as the old
Are quite enough for me, so they but hold.

O Pleasure! you are indeed a pleasant thing,
Although one must be damn'd for you, no doubt:
I make a resolution every spring
Of reformation, ere the year run out,
But somehow, this my vestal vow takes wing,
Yet still, I trust it may be kept throughout:
I 'm very sorry, very much ashamed,
And mean, next winter, to be quite reclaim'd.

Here my chaste Muse a liberty must take—
Start not! still chaster reader—she 'll be nice hence—
Forward, and there is no great cause to quake;
This liberty is a poetic licence,
Which some irregularity may make
In the design, and as I have a high sense
Of Aristotle and the Rules, 't is fit
To beg his pardon when I err a bit.

This licence is to hope the reader will
Suppose from June the sixth (the fatal day,
Without whose epoch my poetic skill
For want of facts would all be thrown away),
But keeping Julia and Don Juan still
In sight, that several months have pass'd; we 'll say
'T was in November, but I 'm not so sure
About the day—the era 's more obscure.

We 'll talk of that anon.—'T is sweet to hear
At midnight on the blue and moonlit deep
The song and oar of Adria's gondolier,
By distance mellow'd, o'er the waters sweep;
'T is sweet to see the evening star appear;
'T is sweet to listen as the night-winds creep
From leaf to leaf; 't is sweet to view on high
The rainbow, based on ocean, span the sky.

'T is sweet to hear the watch-dog's honest bark
Bay deep-mouth'd welcome as we draw near home;
'T is sweet to know there is an eye will mark
Our coming, and look brighter when we come;
'T is sweet to be awaken'd by the lark,
Or lull'd by falling waters; sweet the hum
Of bees, the voice of girls, the song of birds,
The lisp of children, and their earliest words.

Sweet is the vintage, when the showering grapes
In Bacchanal profusion reel to earth,
Purple and gushing: sweet are our escapes
From civic revelry to rural mirth;
Sweet to the miser are his glittering heaps,
Sweet to the father is his first-born's birth,
Sweet is revenge—especially to women,
Pillage to soldiers, prize-money to seamen.

Sweet is a legacy, and passing sweet
The unexpected death of some old lady
Or gentleman of seventy years complete,
Who 've made 'us youth' wait too—too long already
For an estate, or cash, or country seat,
Still breaking, but with stamina so steady
That all the Israelites are fit to mob its
Next owner for their double-damn'd post-obits.

'T is sweet to win, no matter how, one's laurels,
By blood or ink; 't is sweet to put an end
To strife; 't is sometimes sweet to have our quarrels,
Particularly with a tiresome friend:
Sweet is old wine in bottles, ale in barrels;
Dear is the helpless creature we defend
Against the world; and dear the schoolboy spot
We ne'er forget, though there we are forgot.

But sweeter still than this, than these, than all,
Is first and passionate love—it stands alone,
Like Adam's recollection of his fall;
The tree of knowledge has been pluck'd—all 's known—
And life yields nothing further to recall
Worthy of this ambrosial sin, so shown,
No doubt in fable, as the unforgiven
Fire which Prometheus filch'd for us from heaven.

Man 's a strange animal, and makes strange use
Of his own nature, and the various arts,
And likes particularly to produce
Some new experiment to show his parts;
This is the age of oddities let loose,
Where different talents find their different marts;
You 'd best begin with truth, and when you 've lost your
Labour, there 's a sure market for imposture.

What opposite discoveries we have seen!
(Signs of true genius, and of empty pockets.)
One makes new noses, one a guillotine,
One breaks your bones, one sets them in their sockets;
But vaccination certainly has been
A kind antithesis to Congreve's rockets,
With which the Doctor paid off an old pox,
By borrowing a new one from an ox.

Bread has been made (indifferent) from potatoes;
And galvanism has set some corpses grinning,
But has not answer'd like the apparatus
Of the Humane Society's beginning
By which men are unsuffocated gratis:
What wondrous new machines have late been spinning!
I said the small-pox has gone out of late;
Perhaps it may be follow'd by the great.

'T is said the great came from America;
Perhaps it may set out on its return,—
The population there so spreads, they say
'T is grown high time to thin it in its turn,
With war, or plague, or famine, any way,
So that civilisation they may learn;
And which in ravage the more loathsome evil is—
Their real lues, or our pseudo-syphilis?

This is the patent-age of new inventions
For killing bodies, and for saving souls,
All propagated with the best intentions;
Sir Humphry Davy's lantern, by which coals
Are safely mined for in the mode he mentions,
Tombuctoo travels, voyages to the Poles,
Are ways to benefit mankind, as true,
Perhaps, as shooting them at Waterloo.

Man 's a phenomenon, one knows not what,
And wonderful beyond all wondrous measure;
'T is pity though, in this sublime world, that
Pleasure 's a sin, and sometimes sin 's a pleasure;
Few mortals know what end they would be at,
But whether glory, power, or love, or treasure,
The path is through perplexing ways, and when
The goal is gain'd, we die, you know—and then—

What then?—I do not know, no more do you—
And so good night.—Return we to our story:
'T was in November, when fine days are few,
And the far mountains wax a little hoary,
And clap a white cape on their mantles blue;
And the sea dashes round the promontory,
And the loud breaker boils against the rock,
And sober suns must set at five o'clock.

'T was, as the watchmen say, a cloudy night;
No moon, no stars, the wind was low or loud
By gusts, and many a sparkling hearth was bright
With the piled wood, round which the family crowd;
There 's something cheerful in that sort of light,
Even as a summer sky 's without a cloud:
I 'm fond of fire, and crickets, and all that,
A lobster salad, and champagne, and chat.

'T was midnight—Donna Julia was in bed,
Sleeping, most probably,—when at her door
Arose a clatter might awake the dead,
If they had never been awoke before,
And that they have been so we all have read,
And are to be so, at the least, once more.--
The door was fasten'd, but with voice and fist
First knocks were heard, then 'Madam—Madam—hist!

'For God's sake, Madam—Madam—here 's my master,
With more than half the city at his back—
Was ever heard of such a curst disaster!
'T is not my fault—I kept good watch—Alack!
Do pray undo the bolt a little faster—
They 're on the stair just now, and in a crack
Will all be here; perhaps he yet may fly—
Surely the window 's not so very high!'

By this time Don Alfonso was arrived,
With torches, friends, and servants in great number;
The major part of them had long been wived,
And therefore paused not to disturb the slumber
Of any wicked woman, who contrived
By stealth her husband's temples to encumber:
Examples of this kind are so contagious,
Were one not punish'd, all would be outrageous.

I can't tell how, or why, or what suspicion
Could enter into Don Alfonso's head;
But for a cavalier of his condition
It surely was exceedingly ill-bred,
Without a word of previous admonition,
To hold a levee round his lady's bed,
And summon lackeys, arm'd with fire and sword,
To prove himself the thing he most abhorr'd.

Poor Donna Julia, starting as from sleep
(Mind—that I do not say—she had not slept),
Began at once to scream, and yawn, and weep;
Her maid Antonia, who was an adept,
Contrived to fling the bed-clothes in a heap,
As if she had just now from out them crept:
I can't tell why she should take all this trouble
To prove her mistress had been sleeping double.

But Julia mistress, and Antonia maid,
Appear'd like two poor harmless women, who
Of goblins, but still more of men afraid,
Had thought one man might be deterr'd by two,
And therefore side by side were gently laid,
Until the hours of absence should run through,
And truant husband should return, and say,
'My dear, I was the first who came away.'

Now Julia found at length a voice, and cried,
'In heaven's name, Don Alfonso, what d' ye mean?
Has madness seized you? would that I had died
Ere such a monster's victim I had been!
What may this midnight violence betide,
A sudden fit of drunkenness or spleen?
Dare you suspect me, whom the thought would kill?
Search, then, the room!'—Alfonso said, 'I will.'

He search'd, they search'd, and rummaged everywhere,
Closet and clothes' press, chest and window-seat,
And found much linen, lace, and several pair
Of stockings, slippers, brushes, combs, complete,
With other articles of ladies fair,
To keep them beautiful, or leave them neat:
Arras they prick'd and curtains with their swords,
And wounded several shutters, and some boards.

Under the bed they search'd, and there they found—
No matter what—it was not that they sought;
They open'd windows, gazing if the ground
Had signs or footmarks, but the earth said nought;
And then they stared each other's faces round:
'T is odd, not one of all these seekers thought,
And seems to me almost a sort of blunder,
Of looking in the bed as well as under.

During this inquisition, Julia's tongue
Was not asleep—'Yes, search and search,' she cried,
'Insult on insult heap, and wrong on wrong!
It was for this that I became a bride!
For this in silence I have suffer'd long
A husband like Alfonso at my side;
But now I 'll bear no more, nor here remain,
If there be law or lawyers in all Spain.

'Yes, Don Alfonso! husband now no more,
If ever you indeed deserved the name,
Is 't worthy of your years?—you have threescore—
Fifty, or sixty, it is all the same—
Is 't wise or fitting, causeless to explore
For facts against a virtuous woman's fame?
Ungrateful, perjured, barbarous Don Alfonso,
How dare you think your lady would go on so?

'Is it for this I have disdain'd to hold
The common privileges of my sex?
That I have chosen a confessor so old
And deaf, that any other it would vex,
And never once he has had cause to scold,
But found my very innocence perplex
So much, he always doubted I was married—
How sorry you will be when I 've miscarried!

'Was it for this that no Cortejo e'er
I yet have chosen from out the youth of Seville?
Is it for this I scarce went anywhere,
Except to bull-fights, mass, play, rout, and revel?
Is it for this, whate'er my suitors were,
I favor'd none—nay, was almost uncivil?
Is it for this that General Count O'Reilly,
Who took Algiers, declares I used him vilely?

'Did not the Italian Musico Cazzani
Sing at my heart six months at least in vain?
Did not his countryman, Count Corniani,
Call me the only virtuous wife in Spain?
Were there not also Russians, English, many?
The Count Strongstroganoff I put in pain,
And Lord Mount Coffeehouse, the Irish peer,
Who kill'd himself for love (with wine) last year.

'Have I not had two bishops at my feet,
The Duke of Ichar, and Don Fernan Nunez?
And is it thus a faithful wife you treat?
I wonder in what quarter now the moon is:
I praise your vast forbearance not to beat
Me also, since the time so opportune is—
O, valiant man! with sword drawn and cock'd trigger,
Now, tell me, don't you cut a pretty figure?

'Was it for this you took your sudden journey.
Under pretence of business indispensable
With that sublime of rascals your attorney,
Whom I see standing there, and looking sensible
Of having play'd the fool? though both I spurn, he
Deserves the worst, his conduct 's less defensible,
Because, no doubt, 't was for his dirty fee,
And not from any love to you nor me.

'If he comes here to take a deposition,
By all means let the gentleman proceed;
You 've made the apartment in a fit condition:
There 's pen and ink for you, sir, when you need—
Let every thing be noted with precision,
I would not you for nothing should be fee'd—
But, as my maid 's undrest, pray turn your spies out.'
'Oh!' sobb'd Antonia, 'I could tear their eyes out.'

'There is the closet, there the toilet, there
The antechamber—search them under, over;
There is the sofa, there the great arm-chair,
The chimney—which would really hold a lover.
I wish to sleep, and beg you will take care
And make no further noise, till you discover
The secret cavern of this lurking treasure—
And when 't is found, let me, too, have that pleasure.

'And now, Hidalgo! now that you have thrown
Doubt upon me, confusion over all,
Pray have the courtesy to make it known
Who is the man you search for? how d' ye cal
Him? what 's his lineage? let him but be shown—
I hope he 's young and handsome—is he tall?
Tell me—and be assured, that since you stain
My honour thus, it shall not be in vain.

'At least, perhaps, he has not sixty years,
At that age he would be too old for slaughter,
Or for so young a husband's jealous fears
(Antonia! let me have a glass of water).
I am ashamed of having shed these tears,
They are unworthy of my father's daughter;
My mother dream'd not in my natal hour
That I should fall into a monster's power.

'Perhaps 't is of Antonia you are jealous,
You saw that she was sleeping by my side
When you broke in upon us with your fellows:
Look where you please—we 've nothing, sir, to hide;
Only another time, I trust, you 'll tell us,
Or for the sake of decency abide
A moment at the door, that we may be
Drest to receive so much good company.

'And now, sir, I have done, and say no more;
The little I have said may serve to show
The guileless heart in silence may grieve o'er
The wrongs to whose exposure it is slow:
I leave you to your conscience as before,
'T will one day ask you why you used me so?
God grant you feel not then the bitterest grief!-
Antonia! where 's my pocket-handkerchief?'

She ceased, and turn'd upon her pillow; pale
She lay, her dark eyes flashing through their tears,
Like skies that rain and lighten; as a veil,
Waved and o'ershading her wan cheek, appears
Her streaming hair; the black curls strive, but fail,
To hide the glossy shoulder, which uprears
Its snow through all;—her soft lips lie apart,
And louder than her breathing beats her heart.

The Senhor Don Alfonso stood confused;
Antonia bustled round the ransack'd room,
And, turning up her nose, with looks abused
Her master and his myrmidons, of whom
Not one, except the attorney, was amused;
He, like Achates, faithful to the tomb,
So there were quarrels, cared not for the cause,
Knowing they must be settled by the laws.

With prying snub-nose, and small eyes, he stood,
Following Antonia's motions here and there,
With much suspicion in his attitude;
For reputations he had little care;
So that a suit or action were made good,
Small pity had he for the young and fair,
And ne'er believed in negatives, till these
Were proved by competent false witnesses.

But Don Alfonso stood with downcast looks,
And, truth to say, he made a foolish figure;
When, after searching in five hundred nooks,
And treating a young wife with so much rigour,
He gain'd no point, except some self-rebukes,
Added to those his lady with such vigour
Had pour'd upon him for the last half-hour,
Quick, thick, and heavy—as a thunder-shower.

At first he tried to hammer an excuse,
To which the sole reply was tears and sobs,
And indications of hysterics, whose
Prologue is always certain throes, and throbs,
Gasps, and whatever else the owners choose:
Alfonso saw his wife, and thought of Job's;
He saw too, in perspective, her relations,
And then he tried to muster all his patience.

He stood in act to speak, or rather stammer,
But sage Antonia cut him short before
The anvil of his speech received the hammer,
With 'Pray, sir, leave the room, and say no more,
Or madam dies.'—Alfonso mutter'd, 'D—n her,'
But nothing else, the time of words was o'er;
He cast a rueful look or two, and did,
He knew not wherefore, that which he was bid.

With him retired his 'posse comitatus,'
The attorney last, who linger'd near the door
Reluctantly, still tarrying there as late as
Antonia let him—not a little sore
At this most strange and unexplain'd 'hiatus'
In Don Alfonso's facts, which just now wore
An awkward look; as he revolved the case,
The door was fasten'd in his legal face.

No sooner was it bolted, than—Oh shame!
O sin! Oh sorrow! and oh womankind!
How can you do such things and keep your fame,
Unless this world, and t' other too, be blind?
Nothing so dear as an unfilch'd good name!
But to proceed—for there is more behind:
With much heartfelt reluctance be it said,
Young Juan slipp'd half-smother'd, from the bed.

He had been hid—I don't pretend to say
How, nor can I indeed describe the where—
Young, slender, and pack'd easily, he lay,
No doubt, in little compass, round or square;
But pity him I neither must nor may
His suffocation by that pretty pair;
'T were better, sure, to die so, than be shut
With maudlin Clarence in his Malmsey butt.

And, secondly, I pity not, because
He had no business to commit a sin,
Forbid by heavenly, fined by human laws,
At least 't was rather early to begin;
But at sixteen the conscience rarely gnaws
So much as when we call our old debts in
At sixty years, and draw the accompts of evil,
And find a deuced balance with the devil.

Of his position I can give no notion:
'T is written in the Hebrew Chronicle,
How the physicians, leaving pill and potion,
Prescribed, by way of blister, a young belle,
When old King David's blood grew dull in motion,
And that the medicine answer'd very well;
Perhaps 't was in a different way applied,
For David lived, but Juan nearly died.

What 's to be done? Alfonso will be back
The moment he has sent his fools away.
Antonia's skill was put upon the rack,
But no device could be brought into play—
And how to parry the renew'd attack?
Besides, it wanted but few hours of day:
Antonia puzzled; Julia did not speak,
But press'd her bloodless lip to Juan's cheek.

He turn'd his lip to hers, and with his hand
Call'd back the tangles of her wandering hair;
Even then their love they could not all command,
And half forgot their danger and despair:
Antonia's patience now was at a stand—
'Come, come, 't is no time now for fooling there,'
She whisper'd, in great wrath—'I must deposit
This pretty gentleman within the closet:

'Pray, keep your nonsense for some luckier night—
Who can have put my master in this mood?
What will become on 't—I 'm in such a fright,
The devil 's in the urchin, and no good—
Is this a time for giggling? this a plight?
Why, don't you know that it may end in blood?
You 'll lose your life, and I shall lose my place,
My mistress all, for that half-girlish face.

'Had it but been for a stout cavalier
Of twenty-five or thirty (come, make haste)—
But for a child, what piece of work is here!
I really, madam, wonder at your taste
(Come, sir, get in)—my master must be near:
There, for the present, at the least, he's fast,
And if we can but till the morning keep
Our counsel—(Juan, mind, you must not sleep).'

Now, Don Alfonso entering, but alone,
Closed the oration of the trusty maid:
She loiter'd, and he told her to be gone,
An order somewhat sullenly obey'd;
However, present remedy was none,
And no great good seem'd answer'd if she stay'd:
Regarding both with slow and sidelong view,
She snuff'd the candle, curtsied, and withdrew.

Alfonso paused a minute—then begun
Some strange excuses for his late proceeding;
He would not justify what he had done,
To say the best, it was extreme ill-breeding;
But there were ample reasons for it, none
Of which he specified in this his pleading:
His speech was a fine sample, on the whole,
Of rhetoric, which the learn'd call 'rigmarole.'

Julia said nought; though all the while there rose
A ready answer, which at once enables
A matron, who her husband's foible knows,
By a few timely words to turn the tables,
Which, if it does not silence, still must pose,—
Even if it should comprise a pack of fables;
'T is to retort with firmness, and when he
Suspects with one, do you reproach with three.

Julia, in fact, had tolerable grounds,—
Alfonso's loves with Inez were well known,
But whether 't was that one's own guilt confounds—
But that can't be, as has been often shown,
A lady with apologies abounds;—
It might be that her silence sprang alone
From delicacy to Don Juan's ear,
To whom she knew his mother's fame was dear.

There might be one more motive, which makes two;
Alfonso ne'er to Juan had alluded,—
Mention'd his jealousy but never who
Had been the happy lover, he concluded,
Conceal'd amongst his premises; 't is true,
His mind the more o'er this its mystery brooded;
To speak of Inez now were, one may say,
Like throwing Juan in Alfonso's way.

A hint, in tender cases, is enough;
Silence is best, besides there is a tact
(That modern phrase appears to me sad stuff,
But it will serve to keep my verse compact)—
Which keeps, when push'd by questions rather rough,
A lady always distant from the fact:
The charming creatures lie with such a grace,
There 's nothing so becoming to the face.

They blush, and we believe them; at least I
Have always done so; 't is of no great use,
In any case, attempting a reply,
For then their eloquence grows quite profuse;
And when at length they 're out of breath, they sigh,
And cast their languid eyes down, and let loose
A tear or two, and then we make it up;
And then—and then—and then—sit down and sup.

Alfonso closed his speech, and begg'd her pardon,
Which Julia half withheld, and then half granted,
And laid conditions he thought very hard on,
Denying several little things he wanted:
He stood like Adam lingering near his garden,
With useless penitence perplex'd and haunted,
Beseeching she no further would refuse,
When, lo! he stumbled o'er a pair of shoes.

A pair of shoes!—what then? not much, if they
Are such as fit with ladies' feet, but these
(No one can tell how much I grieve to say)
Were masculine; to see them, and to seize,
Was but a moment's act.—Ah! well-a-day!
My teeth begin to chatter, my veins freeze—
Alfonso first examined well their fashion,
And then flew out into another passion.

He left the room for his relinquish'd sword,
And Julia instant to the closet flew.
'Fly, Juan, fly! for heaven's sake—not a word—
The door is open—you may yet slip through
The passage you so often have explored—
Here is the garden-key—Fly—fly—Adieu!
Haste—haste! I hear Alfonso's hurrying feet—
Day has not broke—there 's no one in the street:

None can say that this was not good advice,
The only mischief was, it came too late;
Of all experience 't is the usual price,
A sort of income-tax laid on by fate:
Juan had reach'd the room-door in a. trice,
And might have done so by the garden-gate,
But met Alfonso in his dressing-gown,
Who threaten'd death—so Juan knock'd him down.

Dire was the scuffle, and out went the light;
Antonia cried out 'Rape!' and Julia 'Fire!'
But not a servant stirr'd to aid the fight.
Alfonso, pommell'd to his heart's desire,
Swore lustily he'd be revenged this night;
And Juan, too, blasphemed an octave higher;
His blood was up: though young, he was a Tartar,
And not at all disposed to prove a martyr.

Alfonso's sword had dropp'd ere he could draw it,
And they continued battling hand to hand,
For Juan very luckily ne'er saw it;
His temper not being under great command,
If at that moment he had chanced to claw it,
Alfonso's days had not been in the land
Much longer.—Think of husbands', lovers' lives!
And how ye may be doubly widows—wives!

Alfonso grappled to detain the foe,
And Juan throttled him to get away,
And blood ('t was from the nose) began to flow;
At last, as they more faintly wrestling lay,
Juan contrived to give an awkward blow,
And then his only garment quite gave way;
He fled, like Joseph, leaving it; but there,
I doubt, all likeness ends between the pair.

Lights came at length, and men, and maids, who found
An awkward spectacle their eyes before;
Antonia in hysterics, Julia swoon'd,
Alfonso leaning, breathless, by the door;
Some half-torn drapery scatter'd on the ground,
Some blood, and several footsteps, but no more:
Juan the gate gain'd, turn'd the key about,
And liking not the inside, lock'd the out.

Here ends this canto.—Need I sing, or say,
How Juan naked, favour'd by the night,
Who favours what she should not, found his way,
And reach'd his home in an unseemly plight?
The pleasant scandal which arose next day,
The nine days' wonder which was brought to light,
And how Alfonso sued for a divorce,
Were in the English newspapers, of course.

If you would like to see the whole proceedings,
The depositions, and the cause at full,
The names of all the witnesses, the pleadings
Of counsel to nonsuit, or to annul,
There 's more than one edition, and the readings
Are various, but they none of them are dull;
The best is that in short-hand ta'en by Gurney,
Who to Madrid on purpose made a journey.

But Donna Inez, to divert the train
Of one of the most circulating scandals
That had for centuries been known in Spain,
At least since the retirement of the Vandals,
First vow'd (and never had she vow'd in vain)
To Virgin Mary several pounds of candles;
And then, by the advice of some old ladies,
She sent her son to be shipp'd off from Cadiz.

She had resolved that he should travel through
All European climes, by land or sea,
To mend his former morals, and get new,
Especially in France and Italy
(At least this is the thing most people do).
Julia was sent into a convent: she
Grieved, but, perhaps, her feelings may be better
Shown in the following copy of her Letter:—

'They tell me 't is decided; you depart:
'T is wise—'t is well, but not the less a pain;
I have no further claim on your young heart,
Mine is the victim, and would be again;
To love too much has been the only art
I used;—I write in haste, and if a stain
Be on this sheet, 't is not what it appears;
My eyeballs burn and throb, but have no tears.

'I loved, I love you, for this love have lost
State, station, heaven, mankind's, my own esteem,
And yet can not regret what it hath cost,
So dear is still the memory of that dream;
Yet, if I name my guilt, 't is not to boast,
None can deem harshlier of me than I deem:
I trace this scrawl because I cannot rest—
I 've nothing to reproach, or to request.

'Man's love is of man's life a thing apart,
'T is woman's whole existence; man may range
The court, camp, church, the vessel, and the mart;
Sword, gown, gain, glory, offer in exchange
Pride, fame, ambition, to fill up his heart,
And few there are whom these cannot estrange;
Men have all these resources, we but one,
To love again, and be again undone.

'You will proceed in pleasure, and in pride,
Beloved and loving many; all is o'er
For me on earth, except some years to hide
My shame and sorrow deep in my heart's core;
These I could bear, but cannot cast aside
The passion which still rages as before—
And so farewell—forgive me, love me—No,
That word is idle now—but let it go.

'My breast has been all weakness, is so yet;
But still I think I can collect my mind;
My blood still rushes where my spirit 's set,
As roll the waves before the settled wind;
My heart is feminine, nor can forget—
To all, except one image, madly blind;
So shakes the needle, and so stands the pole,
As vibrates my fond heart to my fix'd soul.

'I have no more to say, but linger still,
And dare not set my seal upon this sheet,
And yet I may as well the task fulfil,
My misery can scarce be more complete:
I had not lived till now, could sorrow kill;
Death shuns the wretch who fain the blow would meet,
And I must even survive this last adieu,
And bear with life, to love and pray for you!'

This note was written upon gilt-edged paper
With a neat little crow-quill, slight and new:
Her small white hand could hardly reach the taper,
It trembled as magnetic needles do,
And yet she did not let one tear escape her;
The seal a sun-flower; 'Elle vous suit partout,'
The motto cut upon a white cornelian;
The wax was superfine, its hue vermilion.

This was Don Juan's earliest scrape; but whether
I shall proceed with his adventures is
Dependent on the public altogether;
We 'll see, however, what they say to this:
Their favour in an author's cap 's a feather,
And no great mischief 's done by their caprice;
And if their approbation we experience,
Perhaps they 'll have some more about a year hence.

My poem 's epic, and is meant to be
Divided in twelve books; each book containing,
With love, and war, a heavy gale at sea,
A list of ships, and captains, and kings reigning,
New characters; the episodes are three:
A panoramic view of hell 's in training,
After the style of Virgil and of Homer,
So that my name of Epic 's no misnomer.

All these things will be specified in time,
With strict regard to Aristotle's rules,
The Vade Mecum of the true sublime,
Which makes so many poets, and some fools:
Prose poets like blank-verse, I 'm fond of rhyme,
Good workmen never quarrel with their tools;
I 've got new mythological machinery,
And very handsome supernatural scenery.

There 's only one slight difference between
Me and my epic brethren gone before,
And here the advantage is my own, I ween
(Not that I have not several merits more,
But this will more peculiarly be seen);
They so embellish, that 't is quite a bore
Their labyrinth of fables to thread through,
Whereas this story 's actually true.

If any person doubt it, I appeal
To history, tradition, and to facts,
To newspapers, whose truth all know and feel,
To plays in five, and operas in three acts;
All these confirm my statement a good deal,
But that which more completely faith exacts
Is that myself, and several now in Seville,
Saw Juan's last elopement with the devil.

If ever I should condescend to prose,
I 'll write poetical commandments, which
Shall supersede beyond all doubt all those
That went before; in these I shall enrich
My text with many things that no one knows,
And carry precept to the highest pitch:
I 'll call the work 'Longinus o'er a Bottle,
Or, Every Poet his own Aristotle.'

Thou shalt believe in Milton, Dryden, Pope;
Thou shalt not set up Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey;
Because the first is crazed beyond all hope,
The second drunk, the third so quaint and mouthy:
With Crabbe it may be difficult to cope,
And Campbell's Hippocrene is somewhat drouthy:
Thou shalt not steal from Samuel Rogers, nor
Commit—flirtation with the muse of Moore.

Thou shalt not covet Mr. Sotheby's Muse,
His Pegasus, nor anything that 's his;
Thou shalt not bear false witness like 'the Blues'
(There 's one, at least, is very fond of this);
Thou shalt not write, in short, but what I choose:
This is true criticism, and you may kiss—
Exactly as you please, or not,—the rod;

If any person should presume to assert
This story is not moral, first, I pray,
That they will not cry out before they 're hurt,
Then that they 'll read it o'er again, and say
(But, doubtless, nobody will be so pert)
That this is not a moral tale, though gay;
Besides, in Canto Twelfth, I mean to show
The very place where wicked people go.

If, after all, there should be some so blind
To their own good this warning to despise,
Led by some tortuosity of mind,
Not to believe my verse and their own eyes,
And cry that they 'the moral cannot find,'
I tell him, if a clergyman, he lies;
Should captains the remark, or critics, make,
They also lie too—under a mistake.

The public approbation I expect,
And beg they 'll take my word about the moral,
Which I with their amusement will connect
(So children cutting teeth receive a coral);
Meantime, they 'll doubtless please to recollect
My epical pretensions to the laurel:
For fear some prudish readers should grow skittish,
I 've bribed my grandmother's review—the British.

I sent it in a letter to the Editor,
Who thank'd me duly by return of post—
I 'm for a handsome article his creditor;
Yet, if my gentle Muse he please to roast,
And break a promise after having made it her,
Denying the receipt of what it cost,
And smear his page with gall instead of honey,
All I can say is—that he had the money.

I think that with this holy new alliance
I may ensure the public, and defy
All other magazines of art or science,
Daily, or monthly, or three monthly; I
Have not essay'd to multiply their clients,
Because they tell me 't were in vain to try,
And that the Edinburgh Review and Quarterly
Treat a dissenting author very martyrly.

'Non ego hoc ferrem calida juventa
Consule Planco,' Horace said, and so
Say I; by which quotation there is meant a
Hint that some six or seven good years ago
(Long ere I dreamt of dating from the Brenta)
I was most ready to return a blow,
And would not brook at all this sort of thing
In my hot youth—when George the Third was King.

But now at thirty years my hair is grey
(I wonder what it will be like at forty?
I thought of a peruke the other day)—
My heart is not much greener; and, in short, I
Have squander'd my whole summer while 't was May,
And feel no more the spirit to retort; I
Have spent my life, both interest and principal,
And deem not, what I deem'd, my soul invincible.

No more—no more—Oh! never more on me
The freshness of the heart can fall like dew,
Which out of all the lovely things we see
Extracts emotions beautiful and new,
Hived in our bosoms like the bag o' the bee:
Think'st thou the honey with those objects grew?
Alas! 't was not in them, but in thy power
To double even the sweetness of a flower.

No more—no more—Oh! never more, my heart,
Canst thou be my sole world, my universe!
Once all in all, but now a thing apart,
Thou canst not be my blessing or my curse:
The illusion 's gone for ever, and thou art
Insensible, I trust, but none the worse,
And in thy stead I 've got a deal of judgment,
Though heaven knows how it ever found a lodgment.

My days of love are over; me no more
The charms of maid, wife, and still less of widow,
Can make the fool of which they made before,—
In short, I must not lead the life I did do;
The credulous hope of mutual minds is o'er,
The copious use of claret is forbid too,
So for a good old-gentlemanly vice,
I think I must take up with avarice.

Ambition was my idol, which was broken
Before the shrines of Sorrow, and of Pleasure;
And the two last have left me many a token
O'er which reflection may be made at leisure:
Now, like Friar Bacon's brazen head, I 've spoken,
'Time is, Time was, Time 's past:'—a chymic treasure
Is glittering youth, which I have spent betimes—
My heart in passion, and my head on rhymes.

What is the end of Fame? 't is but to fill
A certain portion of uncertain paper:
Some liken it to climbing up a hill,
Whose summit, like all hills, is lost in vapour;
For this men write, speak, preach, and heroes kill,
And bards burn what they call their 'midnight taper,'
To have, when the original is dust,
A name, a wretched picture, and worse bust.

What are the hopes of man? Old Egypt's King
Cheops erected the first pyramid
And largest, thinking it was just the thing
To keep his memory whole, and mummy hid;
But somebody or other rummaging,
Burglariously broke his coffin's lid:
Let not a monument give you or me hopes,
Since not a pinch of dust remains of Cheops.

But I being fond of true philosophy,
Say very often to myself, 'Alas!
All things that have been born were born to die,
And flesh (which Death mows down to hay) is grass;
You 've pass'd your youth not so unpleasantly,
And if you had it o'er again—'t would pass—
So thank your stars that matters are no worse,
And read your Bible, sir, and mind your purse.'

But for the present, gentle reader! and
Still gentler purchaser! the bard—that 's I—
Must, with permission, shake you by the hand,
And so 'Your humble servant, and good-b'ye!'
We meet again, if we should understand
Each other; and if not, I shall not try
Your patience further than by this short sample—
'T were well if others follow'd my example.

'Go, little book, from this my solitude!
I cast thee on the waters—go thy ways!
And if, as I believe, thy vein be good,
The world will find thee after many days.'
When Southey's read, and Wordsworth understood,
I can't help putting in my claim to praise—
The four first rhymes are Southey's every line:
For God's sake, reader! take them not for mine.",Lord Byron,1985,"[81, 83, 87, 90, 96]",5

96,Fortress Around Your Heart,"[Verse 1]
Under the ruins of a walled city
Crumbling towers and beams of yellow light
No flags of truce, no cries of pity
The siege guns had been pounding all through the night
It took a day to build the city
We walked through its streets in the afternoon
As I returned across the fields I'd known
I recognized the walls where I'd once laid
I had to stop in my tracks for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid

[Chorus]
And if I built this fortress around your heart
Encircled you in trenches and barbed wire
Then let me build a bridge
For I cannot fill the chasm
And let me set the battlements on fire

[Verse 2]
Then I went off to fight some battle
That I'd invented inside my head
Away so long for years and years
You probably thought or even wished that I was dead
While the armies are all sleeping
Beneath the tattered flag we'd made
I had to stop in my track for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
This prison has now become your home
A sentence you seem prepared to pay
It took a day to build the city
We walked through its streets in the afternoon

I recognized the fields where I'd once played
I had to stop in my tracks for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid

Keeps my body right on the verge
We touch and then
I wanna do it all over again

And it hurts to be in love
When you only want me half as much
I tell you it hurts to be in love

I'm always worried you think i'm pushing too hard
Oh baby it hurts me when you tell me i'm going to far

If you want him, then have him, there's no other way, yeah
I tear your letters up, and flush away the pieces
How does that saying go, you'd love me till hell freezes
You're lyin', I'm dyin' a little each day, girl you know it hurts me so
Stop duckin' and diving, come right out and say

'Cause I can't take no more of this
Love grammar, takin' me and breakin' me up, love grammar, the grammar of love
I before he except after she - knows I'll always be there
Ready or not, she took what I got - to give and she don't care - I before he
Don't wanna lose control, and maybe rock proceedings
Don't fear a new attack, the fact is I'm conceding
If you want him, then take him, don't treat me this way
Cause I just feel like letting go
You want him, you got him, I'm leavin' today

Love grammar, takin' me and breakin' me up, love grammar, the grammar of love
Love grammar, takin' me and breakin' me up, love grammar, the grammar of love

Do you remember dawn escapes from moon washed college halls?
Do you remember the cherry blossom in the market square?
Do you remember I thought it was confetti in our hair?

By the way, didn't I break your heart?
Please excuse me I never meant to break your heart
So sorry, I never meant to break your heart
But you broke mine

Kayleigh, is it too late to say I'm sorry?
And, Kayleigh, could we get it together again
I just can't go on pretending that it came to a natural end
Kayleigh, oh I never thought I'd miss you
And, Kayleigh, I thought that we'd always be friends
We said our love would last forever
So how did it come to this bitter end?

Do you remember barefoot on the lawn with shooting stars?
Do you remember the loving on the floor in Belsize Park?
Do you remember dancing in stilettos in the snow?
Do you remember you never understood I had to go?

By the way, didn't I break your heart?
Please excuse me, I never meant to break your heart
So sorry, I never meant to break your heart
But you broke mine

Kayleigh, I just want to say I'm sorry
But, Kayleigh, I'm too scared to pick up the phone
To hear you've found another lover to patch up our broken home
Kayleigh, I'm still trying to write that love song

If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me

Yawk! Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!

Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window – check yourself!
Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, ""Ayy, y'all—duck!""
That's what Momma said when we was eatin' that free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce!
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
Make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
M.A.A.d. city

Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?

Sleepin' in the living room of my momma's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired, 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons but still will never know my life

I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah that's cool
Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules
But yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately, shit
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip, yeah
Trip, we in the hood still
So, loc, grab a strap 'cause yeah, it's so real, yeah
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Perceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
Probably go to the projects, I

Whoa no, whoa yeah (Woo, oh)
Whoa no, whoa no, yeah yeah, yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
There's a gentle autumn breeze that blows
Whenever we be lyin', lyin' in my bed
The moon appears and disappears, you look at me
My clothes I quickly, I quickly shed
The curtains dance a minuet, autumn plays the music, baby
Come on, hold my hand
Leaves are fallin' velvet splash
Only you and I can under-- only you can understand

[Verse 2]
The sunlight draws a picture through the silky lace
That hangs above your, hangs above your door
A picture that is waving, that it seems to be with every thrust you
Make me beg for more
Oh, a robin sings a masterpiece
That lives and dies unheard
For screams of passion
A sound produced by two in love
Curtains dance and autumn plays on
(Oh, two in love, on and on)
The screams of passion

[Verse 3]
All I hear in my head echoing like a volcano, baby
The screams of passion

149,The Power Of Love,"[Verse 1]
The power of love is a curious thing
Make a one man weep, make another man sing
Change a hawk to a little white dove
More than a feeling that's the power of love
Tougher than diamonds, rich like cream
Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream
Make a bad one good make a wrong one right
Power of love that keeps you home at night

[Chorus]
You don't need money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life
That's the power of love
That's the power of love

[Verse 2]
First time you feel it, it might make you sad
Next time you feel it, it might make you mad
But you'll be glad baby when you've found
That's the power makes the world go'round

[Chorus 2]
And it don't take money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden it can be cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life

[Bridge]
They say that all in love is fair
Yeah, but you don't care
But you know what to do
When it gets hold of you
And with a little help from above
You feel the power of love
You feel the power of love
Can you feel it?
Hmmm

[Outro]
It don't take money and it don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
Tougher than diamonds and stronger than steel

Worm eaten corpses rising in the night
They're seeking human flesh, they live for nothing else
Once they come to you - You can't defend yourself

Out of the grave - Death is stalking you
You can't escape - You're eaten alive

They bite into your flesh

Your bones are stripped of flesh

They're such hard times for lovers

I want to climb on your roof
Beat on your door, act like a fool
Then I'll say it once more
These are hard times
Really hard times for lovers

It isn't easy, no, I try to please you so
It isn't easy, you can take it from me
But maybe easy ain't the way
It's supposed to be
Hard times for lovers

I'm gonna climb on your roof
Beat on your door, act like a fool

155,Every Step Of The Way,"Climbing that mountain day by day
Meeting the world along the way
The sun was on my back
And hopes were high
To reach beyond my dreams
Then there were times when all was lost
Back over bridges that I’d crossed
Many were the days I was alone
I’d want to give it up
And go home
And then I heard your voice calling to me
And then I’d feel your arms so tenderly
I thought I was alone in the wind and the rain
But you were there every step of the way
Music has moved me through the years
Brought me the laughter and the tears
But more than anything I treasure friends
I’ve met along the way
Then there were times that I was sure
Nobody heard me at the door
The more that I would push, the less I’d gain
And I’d be on my knees
Once again
And then I heard your voice calling to me
And then I’d feel your arms so lovingly
I thought I was alone in the wind and the rain
But you were there every step of the way
We were together
In the wind and the rain
And you were there every step of the way
Yes, you were there every step of the way",Chris De Burgh,1985,"[94, 67, 47, 25, 25, 26, 29, 30, 37, 44, 52, 62]",12

Than anything that you could ever learn at school

Though you feel your heart break
You're only human, you're gonna have to deal with heartache

Just like a boxer in a title fight
You got to walk in that ring all alone
You're not the only one who's made mistakes
But they're the only thing that you can truly call your own

Don't forget your second wind
Wait in that corner until that breeze blows in

You've been keeping to yourself these days
Cause you're thinking everything's gone wrong
Sometimes you just want to lay down and die
That emotion can be so strong
But hold on
'Til that old second wind comes along

You probably don't want to hear advice from someone else
But I wouldn't be telling you if I hadn't been there myself
It's alright, it's alright
Sometimes that's all it takes

('Cause you're there for me too)

[Bridge]
No one could ever know me
No one could ever see me
Seems you're the only one who knows
What it's like to be me
Someone to face the day with
Make it through all the rest with
Someone I'll always laugh with
Even at my worst, I'm best with you, yeah

[Middle 8]
It's like you're always stuck in second gear
When it hasn't been your day, your week
Your month, or even your year

I'll be there for you

I'll be there for you
(Like I've been there before)
I'll be there for you

163,You're In Love,"[Verse 1]
You know it's the place I need
But you got me walking circles like a dog on a lead
And the doctors say I'm crazy, that I'm eight miles thick
I'm like the taste of macaroni on a seafood stick
And you got me switched on, baby, like electric eel
And I'm tight with Axel Foley, that's just how I feel
Like a grapefruit and a magic trick, the prodigal son
I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking, I walk so quick

[Pre-Chorus]
And it just don't mean a thing
We've been waiting far too long
We'll play it out again
This is just my serenade

[Chorus 1]
You're in love with a psycho
You're in love with a psycho
And there's nothing you can do about it
I got you running all around it
You're in love with a psycho
You're in love with a psycho
And there's nothing you can do about it
You never gonna be without it

[Verse 2]
Jibber jabber at the bargain booze
And reciting Charles Bukowski, I got nothing to lose
And I wait for you to follow me to share my chips
But you're walking, you're walking, you walk, you walk so quick

[Bridge]
Nobody's gonna take you there
I stick around for the thousand yard stare
I go to sleep in a duffle bag
I'm never up, never down, down, down, down

[Chorus 1]
Hey, you're in love with a psycho
You're in love with a psycho
And there's nothing you can do about it
I got you running all around it
You're in love with a psycho
You're in love with a psycho
And there's nothing you can do about it
You're never gonna be with--

[Break]
Maybe this way we'll find a solution
Maybe this way we'll find a solution
But we're far too lost to find it

[Chorus 2]
You're in love with a psycho
You're in love with a psycho
And there's nothing you can do about it
I got you running all around it
You're in love with a psycho
Tu amor es muy loco
And there's nothing you can do about it
You never gonna be without it",Kasabian,1985,"[93, 89]",2
164,Smokin' In The Boys Room,"[Verse 1]
Sitting in the classroom thinking it's a drag
Listening to the teacher rap, just isn't my bag
When two bells ring you know it's my cue
Going to meet the boys on floor number 2

[Chorus]
Smoking in the boys room
Smoking in the boys room
Teacher don't you fill me up with your rules
Everybody knows that smoking isn't allowed in school

[Verse 2]
Checking out the halls making sure the coast is clear
Looking in the stalls, nah, there isn't nobody here
My buddies Sixx, Mick & Tom
To get caught would surely be the death of us all

[Chorus]
Smoking in the boys room
Smoking in the boys room
Teacher don't you fill me up with your rules
Everybody knows that smoking isn't allowed in school

[Verse 3]
Put me to work in the school book store
Check-out counter and I got bored
Teacher was looking for me all around
Two hours later, you know where I was found

[Chorus]
Smoking in the boys room
Smoking in the boys room
Teacher don't you fill me up with your rules
Everybody knows that smoking isn't allowed in school
Smoking in the boys room
Smoking in the boys room
Teacher don't you fill me up with your rules

165,Never Surrender,"[Intro: DJ Khaled & Anthony Hamilton]
Keep your circle tight
Trust no one, nobody (nobody, nobody, no no no)
DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Scarface]
Gotta be careful who you trusting
Be aware of your surroundings when you hustling
Them niggas smiling at you ain't your friends, dawg
All the real ones are dead or in the pen y'all
You fuck with dude, he your day one
Almost had it all then the day comes
When they walking through your house with the strap out
Pointing at your head, got the bread then you black out (yeah)
Bright lights down the hallways
Left his best friend for dead for the small wage (ay)
They say that every dog's got a day coming
It's like he seen a ghost but he ain't say nothing
Eyes wide shut like you looking at me
Window pane to the soul say they niggas happy
But the pictures say them words we ain't trying to stomach
The homie didn't keep it one hundred
The cops doing roundups, say they got a suspect
Finally got a name now, I'm stunned thinkin fuck that (fuck, that)
For the money, niggas murder what they close to (get this nigga)
Entire families, these motherfuckers ghost you
Smoke you, was it worth what the life was?
Just prepare for the payback cause it strikes cuz
Was it worth what that life was?
Prepare for the payback when it strikes cuz

[Bridge: John Legend]
Cause when you need it the most
Ain't no one ever around
Cold world, cold world

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yo, the pain's unbearable, remains unawareable
He fuck around, jump off a building if you dare him to
The greats they done already killed him, who you compare him to
To really figure out what he said will take a year or two
Family over everything, skills over politics
He don't need the accolades as long as you acknowledge it
Just playing the hand you was dealt, no aces
Betrayal is worse than death in most cases
The world is filled with hypocrites, that's so racist
Multiple shots to the face, no chasers
Mad cause you blew up quick and you excited
Your man that you grew up with get you indicted
This was your nigga, yo, for him you let the trigger go
Found out at the trial they got audio and video
Shit don't always happen how you plan it
Get jammed up and really find out who your fam is
You could feel the picture, you don't need to see the canvas
That nigga Jay'll Hawk you, he don't even play for Kansas
You know when it's someone you love the hurt's pure
You front tryna hold it in, it hurts more
He was right there back-to-back with me, my first war
Even had a crack spot together, the first floor
Used to buzz em in then meet him right by the first door
That was 'prolly a year before I went on my first tour
Friendship was worth more than a couple of ounces
You was 'sposed to be with me arguing with the bouncers
Instead you ended up somewhere far in the mountains
Talking 'about what we was doing, what we was counting
Nothing but old pictures of old sixes
Old BM's with the kits, old Schnitzer's
Two sides, both wishes
Karma is the sister of life, they both bitches

[Bridge: Anthony Hamilton]
See there's a story in my life
There's a story in my pain
There's a story in my tears, oh-oh ohh
There's a story in me

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Yeah, for life
Lord forgive me for my sins, I was chasin' ends
And I'm into makin' money, I ain't into making friends
Cause these niggas rattin', I ain't finna take a chance
Homie said he 'bout that action, they grab him, he take the stand
Damn, say loyalty make a man
Got a homie and he told, I don't even shake his hand
I don't even crack a smile, knew him since a child
Man this game so foul but niggas made vows
To a code I never break, ridin' in the heavyweight
Thirty-six O's in a bird, call it featherweight
Never on time, when I show up I be ready late
Niggas got fat while we starved, they already ate
And I'm trying to get full, masks on, clip full
If he got the money, we attack him like a pit bull
We sellin' soft, we sellin' hard like it's a brick store
On my dick, nigga, thought that's what your bitch for
Hah!

[Bridge: Akon]
My pain ain't never been told (ain't never been told)
All the success that I'm suffering from
Came from this knowledge I sold (this knowledge I know)
My family fucks with me
And fought the enemy that stood in my way (my way)
That's why I don't trust nobody
And I doubt you'll ever see that day

[Chorus: Akon]
'Fore I surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you (surrender to you, which I will never do)

[Bridge: John Legend & Anthony Hamilton]
Cause when you need it the most
Ain't no one ever around (nobody's around)
Cold world (cold world) cold world (mmm, yes it is, yeah)
And the ones that you keep close
Are the ones that'll take you down (always take you down)
Cold world (cooooold) a cold cold world

[Chorus: Akon]
'Fore I surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you (surrender to you)
Fore I surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you (surrender to you, which I will never do)

[Breakdown: Akon & Anthony Hamilton]
Ohh-ohhh ohhh-whooooa
Ohh-ohhhh (ohh-ohhhh) ohh-ohhhhh

[Outro: Anthony Hamilton, Akon & John Legend]
See there's a story in my life (hey) (surrender)
There's a story in my pain (hey) (surrender)

166,What About Love?,"I've been lonely
I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending and that's all I can do
The love I'm sending
Ain't making it through to your heart
You've been hiding, never letting it show
Always trying to keep it under control
You got it down and you're well
On the way to the top
But there's something that you forgot

What about love
Don't you want someone to care about you
What about love
Don't let it slip away
What about love
I only want to share it with you
You might need it someday

I can't tell you what you're feeling inside
I can't sell you what you don't want to buy
Something's missing and you got to
Look back on your life
You know something here just ain't right

What about love
Don't you want someone to care about you
What about love
Don't let it slip away

In violent times, you shouldn't have to sell your soul

Said don't always take life so seriously
Play the flute
And dance and sing your song

Try and enjoy the here and now
The future will take care of itself somehow
The grass is never greener over there
Time will wear away the stone
Gets the hereditary bone

Chorus
Don't try to live your life in one day
Don't go speed your time away
Don't try to live your life in one day
Don't go speed your time away

The old man said to me
Said you can't change the world single-handedly
Raise a glass enjoy the scenery
Pretend the water is champagne
And fill my glass again and again
While the wolves are gathering round your door
Time will wear away the stone
Gets the hereditary bone

The old man said to me
Said don't always take life so seriously
Play the flute
And dance and sing your song

Try and enjoy the here and now
The future will take care of itself somehow
The grass is never greener over there
Time will wear away the stone
Gets the hereditary bone

I tried to live my life in one day
Don't go speed your time away

I bit off more than I can chew
Only so much you can do

Wolves are gathering round my door
Ask them in and invite some more

It may not mean nothin' to y'all

So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 1: Drake]
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches

It may not mean nothin' to y'all

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, ""What?"" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out and goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh

It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all

I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 4: Eminem]
There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow, fuck no
Go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake

It may not mean nothin' to y'all

It's an orchestra of angels
And they're playing with my heart

There must be an angel
Playing with my heart

And when I think that I'm alone
It seems there's more of us at home
It's a multitude of angels
And they're playing with my heart

Watching angels celebrating
Could this be reactivating

The bartender looks as though he knows
You sure you want to do this shit tonight
Because it might hurt baby, you know what I'm sayin'?
Everybody’s, everybody’s been at home
Might hurt you when I
Get up in the morning and leave, you know what I mean?
Here we sit
Take that walk, you know what I mean? Yeah, uhh

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Slammin', when I hit you up, I'm talkin 'bout bangin' something
Chill off in your crib and have a thing, probably make it stank or somethin'
Girl you like my bottom bitch, post my bail, pay for my lawyer
Play your position when them other hoes get out of order
When you wanna give me that pussy? You purchase a plane ticket
Run around town when I bust her down, they want shit like them lames did it
Got her dick whipped, my dick smeared with lipstick
Basically if this bitch lay with me, she payin' me, I'm on some pimp shit
For real, it's 2 A.M., club was 'bout to close up
Thumbing through my contacts bout' to call one of my hoes up
Then I met you, kicked game and followed you to the breakfast spot
Fucked you like I married you that night up in the Marriot
Screaming like you got your cherry popped
Fucking, switching up positions
Thought this shit would never stop, motherfuck an intermission
Damn! (Here we are again)
Here we go again, baby, gotta take that walk now

It ain't gotta be the walk of shame, baby
But that's only if you know the game, baby
Later I can't be the one to blame, baby
But for now take the walk of shame, baby
It ain't gotta be the walk of shame, baby
But that's only if you know the game, baby
Later I can't be the one to blame, baby
But for now take the walk of shame, baby

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Straight slammin', sleepin' with pistols under my pillow
We wake and bake, she up naked, twistin' up cigarillos
I beat that Thursday night and Friday morning, off to work she go
Time to take that walk, just take this dick, don't take it personal
Your friends probably gonna call you a ho, what you trippin' on?
Them bitches want a grip from the same dick you be sitting on
And your girl Monique, she be hitting me when her nigga gone
Trying to buy some weed, she proceed with nothing but Vicky's on
Nothing but ass and titties, but I let that ass convince me
Took it in that, hit that, wish I could say it was accidentally
Like I stepped on a banana peel and fell in that pussy
Y'all niggas be spending all kind of scrill to get in that pussy
And she cop a seven every Friday
Chuck the deuces at her baby daddy as I pulled up out the drive-way
For real (Here we are again)
Here we go again, back in yo' pussy, nigga, you know what I'm saying?

Hey there Mystery Lady love is but a kiss away
And you can bet your bottom dollar

Why hesitate oh I can't wait
There is something that you're missing
The fire in your eyes - you can't disguise
Darling when the nights are cold and lonely - I will keep you warm

You need to be loved by me - Mystery Lady
You need to be loved by me - Mystery Lady

174,You Look Marvelous,"Saludos, my darlings
And you know who you are
Come on, let's mingle
So nice to see you

Throw your hips into the air
Like Cyd Charisse and Fred Astaire
Let's crazy go nuts

Just looking into your eyes, darling
I can tell that you have
The legs of a dancer

So bring those legs and the
Rest of your body over here
And be 'Nando's private prancer

Darling, I got to tell you something
And I don't say this to everybody
You look marvelous
Absolutely marvelous

You know, my dear
My father used to say to me
'Nando, don't be a schnook
It's not how you feel
It's how you look

He was marvelous but you, darling
You look marvelous
Absolutely marvelous

And this is from my heart
Which is deep inside my body
It's better to look good
Than to feel good

Get down (Let's rap!)

(Fernando?) darlings?
(Who's marvelous?) try me

(Cyndi Lauper?) marvelous
(Tina Turner?) still marvelous
(Jayne Meadows?) she's marvelous
(Grace Jones?) humongous

(Cher?) marvelous
(Chaka Khan?) marvelous
(Vanity?) marvelous
(Apollonia?) ditto
(Madonna?) her belly button is absolutely marvelous

I'm about to lose control
And I think I like it

Oh, look, there's Sting
Looking for his last name in the dip

I am what love is all about
I've got American teeth and a Spanish mouth
Please, hold me while I tango

So, my dear, it's been a blast
You were not my first, you won't be my last
Ciao, I've got to mambo

Nothing lasts forever, darling
But it's not the end of the world
When I was fired by Paramount
They were still MGM

I love you young people today
With your rock and roll
Like that Eddie Van Heflin
(Van Halen) whatever

When I look into your eyes, darling
I see the reflection of me
Look at me dancing around in there

I look marvelous
Absolutely marvelous

You know, darling, I love dancing
Dancing to me is like standing still, only faster
Do you know what I'm saying to you

My dear, do you understand the term full grown midget?
Must be me

There are eight million stories in the naked city, darling
Let's be two of them
I'm kidding you, I'm a kidder

Let's you and I go back
To my private hideaway
You put on some soft music
I'll put on my Spiderman pajamas
And we'll do things I'm going to
Tell my friends we did anyway

Darling, I'm worried about
The Cabbage Patch Kids
I mean, when they grow up
Will they be confused that these
People are not their real parents?

You know, I went to a Madonna concert
And the people come dressed like her
With the navel showing and the brassiere
And the ties with the pantyhose, and the beauty mark
And these were some of the guys
I tell you, this rock and roll is really nuts

At eleven A.M. in the morning

175,No Lookin' Back,"I'm fading out of sight
My wheels are the only sound
Runnin' at the speed of light
I can't slow down now

Out on an open road
Racin' to beat the night
No matter where I'm goin'
I guess I'll get all right

So why don't I understand
What's trippin' me up?
It oughta be a simple thing

I can't hold on
And I can't return
It's time to let go
Start to live and learn

I took a one-way flight
Too high to see the ground
Now I know how long it takes
A heart to come down

Alone on the highway now
I'm takin' it mile by mile
I'd rather be a lonely man
Than an imprisoned child

So why do I feel the strain
That keeps trippin' me up
Will it ever be a simple thing

I can't hold on
And I can't return
Rivers will run
And bridges will burn
I can't say just how
But there's no lookin' back now

When everything fades away
And there's nothing left
Then you got to keep rememberin'

I can't slow down
And I can't return
It's time to let go
Start to live and learn

So why don't I understand
What's trippin' me up?
Well, it oughta be a simple thing

I can't hold on
And I can't return
Rivers will run
And bridges will burn
I can't say just how
But there's no lookin' back now

I won't slow down
And I can't return

Come on

[Chorus: Janet Jackson]
You’re missing me, I’m missing you
Whenever we meet, we ain’t gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
It’s fait accompli, we ain’t gonna get no sleep

[Verse 1: Janet Jackson]
A vision rolling round in my head, but I don’t really talk about it
I’m loving what you’re doing to me
And I don’t wanna do without it
Day and night, I dream of us doing whatever
But I guess I’ll have to wait until that day comes

[Chorus: Janet Jackson]
You’re missing me, I’m missing you
Whenever we meet, we ain’t gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
It’s fait accompli, we ain’t gonna get no sleep

[Verse 2: Janet Jackson]
48 hours of love, It's gonna be a weekend marathon
So you better get ready, my king
Cause I'ma be the queen of insomnia
Stay wide awake for every moment we spend together
Cause every second you’re away feels like forever

[Chorus: Janet Jackson]
You’re missing me, I’m missing you
Whenever we meet, we ain’t gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
It’s fait accompli, we ain’t gonna get no sleep

[Bridge: Janet Jackson]
Don’t have time to sleep, but we can dream
So think outside the box, my baby
Show me how much you were missing me
I’ll read between the lines and I sure hope it rains

[Interlude: Janet Jackson (J. Cole)]
Cole world (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah (turn the overall volume up a lil bit, up a lil bit)
How's that? (yeah that’s nice)
We ain’t gonna get no sleep (need time, just a lil more, just a lil more, now, just a lil more now)
We ain’t gonna get no sleep (need time, just a lil more, just a lil more, now, just a lil more now)
We ain’t gonna get no sleep

[Verse 3: J. Cole (Janet Jackson)]
I go my way, you go yours
You taste real life, I taste tours (alright)
Sweet at first, but after a while
Too much sugar, they say, is bad for your smile
And I wear a frown now, 'cause I miss real
I miss a warm house, and home cooked meals
And you miss junk food, that’s why we work
You bring cooked food and I bring dessert
Uh, and meet up at the place that we always do
The one swimming through my mind, that was always you
Our time together has inspired a song or two
Or three, or four, or more, mi amor
I’m sure, either you’re the one or I’m caught in the matrix
Staying up for hours while we talk and get wasted
Not from weed smoke, or this cheap wine
Drunk off love we both feel deep down
But too scared to say cause we know how this ends
Thinking, maybe we’d be better off friends with benefits
For the moment this adrenaline, got me feeling like a kid again
Butterflies like MJ, had to fit it in
My schedule, check the bezel, gotta escape by six
Damn, how’d it get so late so quick?
The sun rising (already?) until the next time
I love diving in your mind and coming out with every diamond I can find (We ain't gonna get no sleep)
No sleep, no sleep

[Chorus: Janet Jackson (J. Cole) Simultaneous]
Can't stop, yeah  (we not, just a lil more, just a lil more, now, just a lil more now)
Can't stop (just a lil more, now, just a lil more now) we ain’t gonna get no sleep (no sleep)

I never told you how I feel inside
I never had the nerve
But now it's gotten much too hard to hide
I'll try to find the words

You make me happy
You give me pleasure
When I'm with you we're on cloud nine
Not just the one night
With you I'm special all the time

You're a little bit a heaven
And I feel like an angel
I like the message that you're sending
Cause with you love isn't painful
You're a little bit a heaven

No more pretending that there's nothin' here
We wasted too much time
You show me signs that make it really clear
Your motives are just fine

You made me happy
You gave me pleasure
When I'm with you we're on cloud nine
Not just the one night
With you I'm special all the time

You're a little bit a heaven
And I feel like an angel
I like the message that you're sending
Cause with you love isn't painful
You're a little bit a heaven

Yeah, throw it away baby

Now that I told you what's been on my mind
I know just what to do
I'll take you home tonight and hold you close
I wanna be with you

Cause you make me happy

Not just the one night
With you forever all the time

Cause with you love isn't painful

You're a little bit a heaven

180,Test Of Time,"[Verse 1]
The flower falls from an elegant tree
And scattering nature's seed
And as the leaves fall after the rain
The soil will always fade
And as the water drips down from the top
From the veil oh I can't be touched
The message reads like a marrying rhyme
As we stand through the test of time

[Pre-Chorus]
Standing the test of time, wondering why
Standing the test of time, gathering why

[Chorus]
Into the night, we are high; never mind
And through the clouds, we arrive, like the stars in sky
And as we dance on the stones, glass beneath our feet
Back from the clouds, be alive, nature speak

[Verse 2]
The hour ends in a soggy sound
As the trees full of fall falls down
And then the leaves drip golden sand
The lettering breaks again
And the river brings up from the top
From the heaven that life forgot
A message reads like a marrying end
As we stand through the test of time

[Pre-Chorus]
Standing the test of time, wondering why
Standing the test of time, gathering why
Standing the test of time, wondering why
Standing the test of time, gathering why

[Chorus]
Into the night, we are high; never mind
And through the clouds, we arrive, like the stars in sky
And as we dance on the stones, glass beneath our feet
Back from the clouds, be alive, nature speak

Standing the test of time, wondering why
Standing the test of time, gathering why
Standing the test of time, wondering why
Standing the test of time, gathering why

181,Down On Love,"[Bridge]
We want two different things at two different times
You know how the story goes; easy come, easy go
If I could change everything overnight, I just might try
But then again

[Verse 1]
You know how it goes
Make up just to break up
Fighting in the evening
Regret it when we wake up
True colors get shown
Feelings change like the seasons
I had to leave you alone
You gave me too many reasons

[Chorus]
Tried your love at five in the morning
I never thought that you would hurt me
Yeah baby, you sure did
I put up with your shit
Call and I ignore it
Why you actin' like it ain’t five in the morning?
When you know you ain't worthy
See, I just need someone to come and pick me up
'Cause I've been down on love
Lately, lately I've been down on love
I've been down on love
Lately, lately I've been down on love

[Verse 2]
You know what they say
You win some, you lose some
Forgot about that old love
Looking for a new one
But you know what they say
Don't be looking for love, looking for love
'Cause when I needed you around, you just let me down

[Chorus]
Tried your love at five in the morning
I never thought that you would hurt me
Yeah baby, you sure did
I put up with your shit
Call and I ignore it
Why you actin' like it ain’t five in the morning?
When you know you ain't worthy
See, I just need someone to come and pick me up
'Cause I've been down on love
Lately, lately I've been down on love
I've been down on love
Lately, lately I've been down on love

[Bridge]
We want two different things at two different times
You know how the story goes; easy come, easy go
If I could change everything overnight, I just might try
But then again
Would you do the same? Would you give it all up?
Would I be the only one? Callin' out your name
'Cause you return the favors, would you do the same?
Could I be the only one callin out your name?

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been down on love
Lately, lately I've been down on love
I've been down on love
Lately, lately I've been down on love
'Cause I've been down on love

The night Spanish Eddie

It was famine or drought

And we was mixin'
Vicks with lemon gin

Like Eddie used to say
""We'll do when we die""

Guess I needed some time to get away
I needed some peace of mind, some peace of mind that'll stay
So I thumbed it down to 6th in L.A
Maybe a Greyhound could be my way

Police and niggers, that's right, get out of my way
Don't need to buy none of your gold chains today
Now, don't need no bracelets clamped in front of my back
Just need my ticket, 'til then, won't you cut me some slack

You're one in a million, yeah, that's what you are
You're one in a million, babe, you're a shooting star
Maybe someday we'll see you before you make us cry
You know we tried to reach you but you were much too high
Much too high, much too high, much too high

Immigrants and faggots, they make no sense to me
They come to our country and think they'll do as they please
Like start some mini Iran or spread some fucking disease
They talk so many God damn ways, it's all Greek to me
Well, some say I'm lazy and others say that's just me
Some say I'm crazy, I guess I'll always be
But it's been such a long time since I knew right from wrong
It's all the means to and end, I, I keep it moving along

187,Love And Pride,"The life I've got this time is mine
No claws or feathers on my wings
I've changed my skin one last time
Love and pride were the springs

Walking in the shadows
I can feel the night
It's got no more dangers for me
'Cause the danger was me

This flesh has started burdening me
A body to carry my spirit around
My spirit does no longer sing
'Cause the song used to be me

Will you let me, won't you let me
Be the voice that speaks in you
Put a drop of black, add a hint of white
The picture's now complete
Will you let me, won't you let me
Be the voice that whispers in you
Paint your heart black, stain your soul white

I look in the mirror, what I see is myself
An ark of flesh to acknowledge my name
Nevermore torn between above and below
After a fight between love and pride

All the time my spirit is singing
While I whisper in the darkness
Light as air, eternal delight
All is finally in me as one

I'll face the challenge to live every day
I will dream of myself everyday
So that all of my dreams
Can be made of flesh and blood

Will you let me, won't you let me
Be the voice that speaks in you
Put a drop of black, add a hint of white
The picture's now complete
Will you let me, won't you let me
Be the voice that whispers in you
Paint your heart black, stain your soul white

I look in the mirror, what I see is myself
An ark of flesh to acknowledge my name
Nevermore torn between above and below
After a fight between love and pride

The sun is my father
The moon is my mother
I will get inside their brown of darkness
And find out the secret rhythm
Crying like an animal
Dancing 'till dawn
And forgetting my mortal name
The sun is my father
The moon is my mother
When I am their son again
I will did you all farewell",Desdemona,1985,"[93, 78, 63, 55, 57, 57, 59, 66, 71, 81, 87]",11

Down...again

You have given me that
Still I look forward to the day you let me in

Sometimes on a Friday I'll stop by

I guess it's two years gone by now
We just sit around talking about the old times

Take me to your heart - rock me tonite

Another sick rock 'n' roller acting like a dick
Needing cash
Burning through the trash
That piles up in this place
And fills up behind my empty face
Full of things that I'm not to do

You come over with all of your friends
And all their opinions I don't want to know
And I'm looking over my shoulder
Booking away with nowhere to go

I run down to the corner lot
It's forty-five past two
I almost forgot to show
Got a date to make with Mr. So-and-So
After which
I won't care when you all start to bitch and moan
About being alone

You come over with all of your friends
And all their opinions I don't want to know
And I'm looking over my shoulder
Booking away with nowhere to go

Well, can't you just leave me alone?
You've already thrown all the sticks and stones
You had to send my way
Well, can't you just leave it at that?
And spare us both the bother
Because I just bounce back anyway
I got nothing that I want to do more
Than make another sonic ""fuck you"" to play
Whenever you make my life cliche
So to fit in some little box with the all the labeled shit
You would say to keep confusion away

You come over with all of your friends
And all their opinions I don't want to know
And I'm looking over my shoulder
Booking away with nowhere to go

You come over with all of your friends
And all their opinions I don't want to know

Niggas call me Hi-C because I'm high as you can see
Niggas say they paid they dues, well I'm checkin' your receipt
Might as well go stupid since this is a stupid beat
Grab the owl out the tree, and ask that bitch, who but me?
Got ya bitch bent over nigga, hands to her feet
Tell that pig and that cow I'll go ham if it's beef
Cause all my niggas well rounded
Don't fuck with none of these square niggas
Mask on, Ghostface Killah, draw down and erase niggas

They don't know the damage
They can do, and it makes me so sad
How we knock each other down

I was either standing in your shadow
Or blocking your light

There's not enough love in the world

Oh darling this is still a shady little town
And sometimes it's so hard to smile
For the world, for the camera
And still you have something left
You don't have to prove nothing to nobody
Just take good care of yourself

I'm not easy to live with
I know that it's true
You're no picnic either, baby
And that's one of the things
I loved about you
But a time will come around
When we need to settle down

Who am I to blame you for doubting what you feel
I was always reachin', you were just a girl I knew
I took for granted the friend I have in you

I was living for a dream, loving for a moment
Taking on the world, that was just my style
Now I look into your eyes, I can see forever
The search is over, you were with me all the while

Can we last forever, do we fall apart
At times it's so confusing, the questions of the heart
You followed me through changes and patiently you'd wait
Till I came to my senses through some miracle of fate

I was living for a dream, loving for a moment
Taking on the world, that was just my style
Now I look into your eyes, I can see forever
The search is over, you were with me all the while

Now the miles stretch out behind me
Loves that I have lost
Broken hearts lie victims of the game
Then good luck it finally struck
Like lightnin' from the blue
Every highway is leadin' me back to you

Now at last I hold you, now all is said and done
The search has come full circle, our destinies are one
So if you ever loved me, show me that you give a damn
You'll know for certain, the man I really am

You're like god damn dynamite
Lit up in a perfect way
You're the match that made me strike
Crazy little renegade

[Pre-Chorus]
So many nights to find the one
I had 'em on repeat
Right when I thought my days were done
You showed the sun to me

[Chorus]
If it wasn't for you
I'd always be in and out of love
Lying in the wrong rooms
And knowing it wasn't quite enough
I'm trying hard to say
That even if I'd never seen your face
I'd be waiting for you
And always be in and out and in and out of love
(In and out of love)

[Verse 2]
You're my secret appetite
Served upon a golden plate
You're the taste to satisfy
Every look that's on my face

So many nights to find the one
I had 'em on repeat
Right when I thought my days were done
You showed the sun to me

[Verse 1]
I was working part time in a five-and-dime
My boss was Mr. McGee
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind
'Cause I was a bit too leisurely
Seems that I was busy doing something close to nothing
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her
She walked in through the out door, out door
She wore a...

[Chorus]
Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

[Verse 2]
Built like she was
She had the nerve to ask me
If I planned to do her any harm
So, look here
I put her on the back of my bike
And-a we went riding
Down by old man Johnson's farm
I said now, overcast days never turned me on
But something about the clouds and her mixed
She wasn't too bright
But I could tell when she kissed me
She knew how to get her kicks
She wore a...

[Chorus]
Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

[Verse 3]
The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
And the horses wonder who you are
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
You feel like a movie star
Listen, they say the first time ain't the greatest
But I tell you, if I had the chance to do it all again
I wouldn't change a stroke
'Cause baby I'm the most
With a girl as fine as she was then

Face to face in secret places, feel the chill
Night fall covers me, but you know the plans I'm making
Still oversea, could it be the whole world opening wide
A sacred why? A mystery gaping inside
The weekends why?
Until we dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
To fatal sounds of broken dreams
Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire.....
Choice for you, is the view to a kill
Between the shades, assignation standing still
The first crystal tears, fall as snowflakes on your body
First time in years, to drench you skin with lovers rosy stain
A chance to find the phoenix for the flame
A chance to die..
But can we dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
To fatal sounds of broken dreams
Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need

See the moon's where it's sunny at
And I move where the realest be
And the quickest, see baby, you gettin' lapped

Why does he say-a-ay

Hush hush, keep it down now, voices carry
Hush hush, keep it down now, voices carry

I try so hard not to get upset
Because I know all the trouble I'll get
Oh, he tells me tears are something to hide
And something to fear-eh-eh
And I try so hard to keep it inside
So no one can hear

Hush hush, keep it down now, voices carry

33 years, damn, I'm grateful I survived
We wasn't s'posed to get past 25
Joke's on you motherfucker, we alive
All these niggas popping now is young
Everybody say the music that they make is dumb
I remember I was 18
Money, pussy, parties, I was on the same thing
You gotta give a boy a chance to grow some
Everybody talkin' like they know somethin' these days
Niggas actin' woke, but they broke, umm
I respect the struggle but you all frontin' these days
Man, they barely old enough to drive
To tell them what they should do, who the fuck am I?
I heard one of 'em diss me, I'm surprised
I ain't trippin', listen good to my reply
Come here lil' man, let me talk with ya
See if I can paint for you the large picture
Congrats 'cause you made it out your mama's house
I hope you make enough to buy your mom a house
I see your watch icy and your whip foreign
I got some good advice, never quit tourin'
'Cause that's the way we eat here in this rap game
I'm fuckin' with your funky lil' rap name
I hear your music and I know that rap's changed
A bunch of folks would say that that's a bad thing
'Cause everything's commercial and it's pop now
Trap drums is the shit that's hot now
See, I've been on a quest for the next wave
But never mind, that was just a segue
I must say, by your songs I'm unimpressed, hey
But I love to see a Black man get paid
And plus, you havin' fun and I respect that
But have you ever thought about your impact?
These white kids love that you don't give a fuck
'Cause that's exactly what's expected when your skin black
They wanna see you dab, they wanna see you pop a pill
They wanna see you tatted from your face to your heels
And somewhere deep down, fuck it, I gotta keep it real
They wanna be black and think your song is how it feels
So when you turn up, you see them turnin' up too
You hit the next city, collect your money when it's due
You gettin' that paper, swimmin' in bitches, I don't blame you
You ain't thinkin' 'bout the people that's lookin' like me and you
True, you got better shit to do
You coulda bought a crib with all that bread that you done blew
I know you think this type of revenue is never endin'
But I wanna take a minute just to tell you that ain't true
One day, them kids that's listening gon' grow up
And get too old for that shit that made you blow up
Now your show's lookin' light cause they don't show up
Which unfortunately means the money slow up
Now you scramblin' and hopin' to get hot again
But you forgot you only popped 'cause you was ridin' trends
Now you old news and you goin' through regrets
'Cause you never bought that house, but you got a Benz
And a bunch of jewels and a bunch of shoes
And a bunch of fake friends, I ain't judgin' you
I'm just tellin' you what's probably gon' happen when you rappin'
'Bout the type of shit you rappin' 'bout
It's a faster route to the bottom
I wish you good luck
I'm hoping for your sake that you ain't dumb as you look
But if it's really true what people sayin'
And you call yourself playin' with my name
Then I really know you fucked, trust

I need your secrets from your past
It's like your stitches are pulled apart
Your information is high demand
And all that content is like grains of sand
As it diffuses through those cracks
It's in the air now, there's no turning back
And those little victims that no one sees
Need information that your body bleeds

[Chorus]
I need to know you're thinking of me
I need to know you're there
I need the information now
I got to know you care
Give me something that I can work with
Deliver me from the dark
Give me something that I can count on
Right now it seems so far

[Verse 2]
You're complicated and hard to read
Your information is all i need
But when those stitches are pulled apart
All that content, it gets so dark
It becomes toxic and hard to breath
You can't escape it, and it gets extreme

[Chorus]
I need to know you're thinking of me
I need to know you're there
I need the information now
I got to know you care
Give me something that I can work with
Deliver me from the dark
Give me someone that I can count on

They tell me, ""Don't forget where you came from""
I regret what I came from
In my old hood moving like I got a vest on me
I'ma keep on winning, you should place your bets on me
I could open up a bakery, baguettes on me
Walking through the mall, I got a check on me
Designer look the best on me
I got lots of pressure, lotsa stress on me
Independent, I got people that depend on me
Knew you was a fake, you can't pretend on me
What I used to spend on you, I spend on me
Somehow all these problems keep on landing on me

All this money turned me to a savage
My life was better when I didn't have shit

Bought myself a house, still feel like I ain't home

Used to pray feds don't kick down the door, yah
Running back the sack the trap feel like a sport, yah
Yeah I'm famous but I miss my life before, yah
Finally got some money, can't go to the store
I lose every girl I love when I'm on tour
My mama calling me and I ignore
Running from my problems 'til my feet get sore

Arm, leg, leg, arm, head – this is God body
Knowledge, wisdom, freedom, understanding, we just want our equality
Food, clothing, shelter, help a nigga find some peace
Happiness for a gangsta, ain't no love in these streets

They can't believe this much skill is in the human body
He's 6'2"", how the fuck he fit in a new Bugatti?
Aw, fuck it, you got me
Question religion, question it all
Question existence until them questions are solved
Meanwhile this heretic, I be out in Marrakesh
Morocco smoking hashish with my fellowship
Y'all dwell on devil shit, I'm in a Diablo
Yellow shit, color of Jell-O shit
Hello bitch, it's me again
Fresh in my Easter clothes feeling like Jesus and

Getting ghost in the Ghost, can you see me? Can you see me?
Have mercy on a Judas, angel wings on a 'ghini
I'm secular, tell the hecklers seckle down
Y'all religion creates division like my Maybach partition
And God is my chauffeur, boy they love Hova
From the south side of Chi to Brooklyn where I growed up
I confess, God in the flesh
Live among the serpents, turn arenas into churches
I'm like Michael, recycle, these are not 16's
These are verses from the Bible
Tell that preacher he's a preacher, I'm a motherfuckin' prophet
Smoke a tree of knowledge, drink from a gold chalice
You gotta love it, I arrive at the pearly gates
I had luggage, meaning I had baggage
Niggas asking me questions, I don't answer to these busters
Only God could judge us, motherfuckers, uh

Have you ever been to heaven?
Have you ever seen the gates?
Have you bowed unto your highness?

Some kind of magic
Some of the time
Between the laughter and the tears
A place to draw the line

When they say that you can't
Say that you won't
So don't even give it a try

I know, hard as it seems
To take all your dreams
And give 'em just one more time

Abadabadango, can you hear
It's the rhythm of the heart
That beats for a million years

Abadabadango
Getting loud and clear
If you listen close to the voice inside
That you wait to hear

It's the time we spend awake at night
A dream that you've had before
Visions pounding in your head
That you just can't ignore

And are we sometimes blinded by
Stars get in our eyes
Break someone's heart, falling apart
Then start again one more time

Abadabadango, can you hear
It's the rhythm of the heart
That beats for a million years

Getting loud and clear
If you listen close to the voice inside
That you wait to hear

239,Possession Obsession,"You know there's something you need
Right here and now
To fill the space inside of yourself
Oh, with money, love or power

When you want to have
The number one, first-run anyone
You're crazy 'til you own them

Better than that, girl
The more that you buy
The less you get back

Possession obsession
Just a taste of
Possession obsession
Brings of a case of possession
I hear you say gimme gimme
Now gimme gimme gimme
Gimme gimme gimme gimme

The compulsion to count
The percentage of time
Spent between two lovers
Can turn an hour into a crime
Oh, all the good times suffer

Though you know it's only jealousy
But you can't help but be
Haunted by your passion

Now, don't you know
It's a matter of fact
The more that you take
The less you give back

I can say
It's a case of
Possession obsession
Just a taste of
Possession obsession
Brings of a case of possession
I hear you say gimme gimme
Now gimme gimme gimme

241,Tough All Over,"[Verse 1]
Some days I can take it all in stride
Some days I just run and hide
And I know I’m not the only one
Who has to struggle through this life

[Chorus]
Things are tough all over
And Lord I see no end in sight
Things are tough all over
It’s a tender world and you are lost tonight
It’s a tender world and you are lost tonight

[Verse 2]
It almost makes me feel ashamed
That I found reasons to complain
'Cause any hard times that I've ever had
Your sweet love just melts them away

[Chorus]
Things are tough all over
And Lord I see no end in sight
Things are tough all over
It’s a tender world and you are lost tonight
It’s a tender world and you are lost tonight

[Verse 3]
So leave the paper on the doorstep
I don’t wanna read the evening news
If this world hasn’t figured it out yet
Then love is the best thing we can do

242,Suddenly,"[Verse 1]
I swear this famous shit just happened overnight
For sure these hoes was so uptight, but now they so polite
All I see is fake love, smiles, and overbites
But I'm pimping, nigga: Dolemite
I remember when, I was like ten, maybe nine
Ricky had a deuce-deuce, two shotty pumps with a baby nine
Busta had the rhymes, Puffy had the Shyne
Bone Thugs had Mo Thugs but that was the shit, that made me rhyme
What's up, what's on your mind? Hold up, I'm feeling fine
Locs got me blind, thugging like I'm Eazy-E up in his prime
Another young nigga with a attitude
I guess that's why the crackers kept me after school
Roaches on the wall, roaches on the dresser
Everybody had roaches but our roaches ain't respect us
On the park bench playing checkers, sipping nectar
Girbaud jeans with hologram straps and reflectors
We had cookouts and dirt bikes and dice games and fistfights
And fish fries and shootouts like one Sig with two rounds
And one click left two down, that's four kids but one lived
Left three dead, but one split, that one miss, that one snitched
That's everyday shit, shit we used to that
Add it up, do the math with your stupid ass
Don't view me as no conscious cat, this ain't no conscious rap
Fuck the conscious crap, my mac'll push your conscience back
I do this for my culture, penny, nickels in the sofa
Mommy watching Oprah, Daddy in the kitchen whipping soda
Cook-connect named Sosa, Spanish chick Viola hit it in the chocha
With the Testarossa, hit Daytona, fuck the law, we soldiers
I'm 'bout it 'bout it, nigga ain't shit sweet about me
The baddest bitches on the block be even speaking 'bout me
I'm so thuggish ruggish bringing ruckus, knucking if you bucking
Young and thugging, bugging showing out in public, but you love it

[Bridge]
I only got one vision, that's for kids in every color, religion
That listen, we gotta beat the system, stay the fuck out the prisons
They try to blind our vision, but we all God children, we siblings
You my brother, you my kin, fuck the color of your skin

[Verse 2]
Back once again
Chilling in the back of the 'Lac with a pass or the gin
Finna ask can I pass to her friend
Then a nigga smash, I'll be damned if I ask her again
Gold slabs on the 'Lac when I spin
Then it's back to the back of the Benz
Lean back in the back with the Henn and a crap
When I tap that that, then attack, never tax, never that that
Max on the ends, spend ends, I remember way back when
A mothafucka used to have to borrow cash from my friends
Friends, just to put a snack up in the fridge
When I'm on, I swear to God to pay you back
Now the kids all look up to me
Them bitches wanna fuck with me
My idols say what's up to me
From ugly to comfortably, suddenly

[Outro]
It all changed man, it was just like yesterday
Times was so ugly and now I'm comfortable
I just only can thank God, suddenly
Everything changed before my eyes by my surprise

Under the cover of night
She crawls into sight
Her skin is cold, china white
She's a dark angel wearing dark glasses
Dark shadows under long false lashes
Hey!

The light exposes the cracks
She wears her makeup like wax
Ooo, to hide every scratch
'Cause she a dark angel riding dark horses
Sitting pretty in her dim lit corners ...

I say
Black cars look better in the shade
Black cars

She smears her lipstick on right before she sleeps
For all those phantom lovers in her dreams

She smokes them French cigarettes
In cocktail gloves and a strapless dress
She cuts a perfect silhouette

But she's a dark angel wearing dark glasses
A fading beauty as the night time passes

I say
Black cars look better in the shade

What switch can I pull to illuminate the way

We all need a love resurrection

What seed must I sow to replenish this barren land
Teach me to harvest, I want you to grow in my hand
Let's be optimistic, let's say that we won't toil in vain
If we pull together we'll never fall apart again

I don’t know what was wrong
But I wasn’t as strong
I’ve seen daisies hold cannonballs above them
But if this was a dream
I still know that I’ve seen
Fields of daisies hold cannonballs above them

[Poetry Section]
I’m so far from perfect
You still loved me when I so far from deserved it
If I’m so brave why does looking you in the eye take every ounce of my courage?
I hang my face to the linoleum and count the freckles on the floor
All of us, all of us are a galaxy of tiny little storms
The good and evil in me wage a bloody civil war
The missiles whistle through me then the rebel pistols roar
I shiver and the final slivers of my chivalry retreat my shriveled core
I can’t imagine that I’ll ever be happy like before
Before, before
We’re sitting in a field in Golden Gate Park off Fulton and 4th
And I’ve never felt less alone
Just a block from the home I’ve outgrown
Five feet and forty years to the right from where dad proposed
An inch above this casserole of stones, grass and mud, rusty needles, lost guitar picks, Indian tombs, and dinosaur bones
Everything happened all at once
And the world is spinning like a hubcap, and not just because of the drugs
We hugged and laid there in each others’ arms all night
Even when the sprinklers cried on us we didn’t mind
We had the rest of our lives to be dry
So we stayed until the edges of the sky turned light
I would have stayed until our hair turned white
The mosquitoes arrived to feast on time
Got drunk at our expense, we didn’t mind
We let them bite, we kept on kissing and obliged
Say “bottoms up, you’ve only got til Tuesday so enjoy the ride!”
And I couldn’t imagine that I would ever be unhappy again
And I whispered in your ear that this moment is already a poem
That I just figured out my first tattoo was going to be of bug bites
Decided I’d commemorate their bloody drink by printing three circles on my ankle, perfect and pink in permanent ink
The beautiful wounds that will keep me, you and this moment forever linked
To remind me when I fail myself, when I fail everyone around me
When I misfire and come tearing through your walls
When the cocktail of humiliation and pain poisons my veins
And this carnival of carnage, this mansion of garbage, this parking lot of carcasses, this heartbreak party drains the spirit that remains
That I have been a part of something worthwhile
To remind me of the pleasure of your pulse
The measure of your breath
The rise and fall of our fortunes and our chests
These spectacular triumphs and flops
That even if that moment meant nothing to the universe, it’s the closest thing to God I’ve got
I’m so far from perfect
So far it’s been worth it

[Bridge]
But if this was a dream
I still know that I've seen
Fields of daisies hold cannonballs above them

[Chorus]
I don’t know what was wrong
But I wasn’t as strong
I’ve seen daisies hold cannonballs above them

I can feel it in my bones
I had a premonition that
He should not go alone

I knew the gun was loaded
But I didn't think he'd kill
Everything exploded
And the blood began to spill

So, baby
Here's your ticket
Put the suitcase in your hand
Here's a little money now

Do it just the way we planned
You be cool for twenty hours
And I'll pay you twenty grand

I'm sorry it went down like this
Someone had to lose
It's the nature of the business
It's the smuggler's blues
Smuggler's blues

The sailors and the pilots
The soldiers and the law
The payoffs and the ripoffs
And the things nobody saw

No matter if it's heroin
Cocaine or hash
You've got to carry weapons
Cause you always carry cash

There's lots of shady characters
Lots of dirty deals
Every name's an alias
In case somebody squeals

It's the lure of easy money
It's gotta very strong appeal
Perhaps you'd understand it better
Standing in my shoes

It's the ultimate enticement
It's the smuggler's blues
Smuggler's blues

See it in the headlines
You hear it every day
They say they're gonna stop it
But it doesn't go away

They move it through Miami
Sell it in L.A
They hide it up in Telluride
I mean it's here to stay

It's propping up the governments
Of Columbia and Peru
You ask any DEA man
He'll say there's nothing we can do

From the office of the President
Right down
To me and you
Me and you

It's a losing proposition
But one you can't refuse

Do you hear what I am saying or not?

[SONYA]
Natasha’s whole body shook
With noiseless, convulsive sobs
Marya touched her hand to her face

[NATASHA]
Don’t touch me!
Let me be! What is it to me? I shall die!

[MARYA D.]
What are we to tell your father? Eh?
In my house!
In my house!
What are we to tell Prince Andrey? Eh?
Oh what do we tell your betrothed?

[NATASHA]
I have no betrothed, I have refused him!

[SONYA]
Natasha, come here, kiss me
Press your wet face to mine

[NATASHA]
Don’t touch me!

[MARYA D.]
Why didn’t he come to the house?
Why didn’t he openly ask for your hand?
You were not kept under lock and key!
Carrying you off like some Gypsy girl!
And if he had carried you off, don’t you think your father would have found him?
Your father, I know him
He will challenge him to a duel and what then?
Will that be all right? Eh?
He’s a scoundrel, he’s a wretch! That’s a fact!

[NATASHA]
He is better than any of you I say
He is better than any of you I say
Why did you interfere! Oh God, what is it all?!
What is it?!
Who are you to tell me anything?!
Sonya, why?!
Go away!
Everyone, go away!

Marya Dmitryevna tried to speak again but Natasha cried out
Go away! Go away! You all hate and despise me!
And she threw herself down on the sofa

[MARYA D.]
Natasha!
Natalya...

I put a pillow under her head
Covered her with two quilts
Brought her a glass of lime-flower water
But Natasha did not respond
Well, let her sleep
Let her sleep

But Natasha was not asleep
Her face was pale
Her eyes wide open

255,Everything She Wants,"[Intro]
Uh huh huh
Ohhh yeah
Work, work

[Verse 1]
Somebody told me
""Boy, everything she wants, is everything she sees""
I guess I must have loved you
Because I said you were the perfect girl for me, maybe
But now we're six months older
And everything you want, and everything you see
Is out of reach, not good enough
I don't know what the hell you want from me, oh

[Chorus]
Somebody tell me, Oh
(Won't you tell me)
Why I work so hard for you?
(To give you money, all to give you money)

[Verse 2]
Some people work for a living
Some people work for fun
Girl, I just work for you
They told me marriage was a give, and take
Well you've shown me you can take, you've got some giving to do
And now you tell me that you're having my baby
I'll tell you that I'm happy if you want me to
But one step further, and my back will break
If my best isn't good enough
Than how can it be good enough for two?
I can't work any harder than I do

[Chorus]
Oh, why do I do the things I do?
I'd tell you if I knew
My God, I don't even think that I love you

[Bridge]
Won't you tell me
Give you money, all to give you money

Oh ohh, Oh Yea
Tell me, tell me

[Verse 3]
How could you settle for a boy like me
When all I could see was the end of the week
All the things we sign
And the things we buy
Ain't gonna keep us together
It's just a matter of time


My situation, never changes
Walking in , and out of that door
Like a stranger, but the wages
I give you all, you say you want more

And all I can see was the end of the week
All the things we sign
And the things we buy
Ain't gonna keep us together
Girl, it's just a matter of time

Just a matter of...

What I just said
But my god woke up on the wrong side of his bed
And it just don't matter now

The wheels of your life have slowly fallen off
Little by little
You have to give it all in all your life

True perfection has to be imperfect
I know that that sounds foolish but it's true

261,Tired Of Being Blonde,"(L. Raspberry)

She left the credit cards under her goodbye note
'All of these are yours, goodbye' and that was all she wrote
Keys to the Porsche she dropped on the floor in the den
Left in the '70 Dodge that he drove her in
She wasn't angry, she wasn't sad
She was just leaving a life that a lot of women wish they had

Tired of being blonde
Tired of running around with the usual guys and gals
Tired of being blonde
Tired of living up to all he expected
Tired of being blonde
Tired of living a life that had only been planned by one
Tired of being blonde
Tired of letting her dreams go neglected

She used to love to know she rounded out his world
She used to love to be all he ever loved in a girl
He liked to buy her clothes that made her sexy and cute
Guess she decided she'd been too long away from her roots
She wasn't crazy, she wasn't mad
She just knew in her heart they had drained her of all that she had

Tired of being blonde
Tired of all the platinum frustration
Tired of being blonde
Tired of looking like a cutie on the cover of a magazine
Tired of being blonde
Tired of chasing all the latest sensations

She wasn't angry, no, no, she wasn't sad
She was just leaving a life that a lot of women wish they had

She was tired of being blonde
Tired of living a life that had only been planned by one
Tired of being blonde
Tired of coping with the desperation
Tired of being blonde
Tired of fighting back the feeling inside that told her to run
Tired of being blonde
Tired of hiding her own inclinations",Carly Simon,1985,"[87, 70, 72, 74, 84]",5

It’s like a burning flame
When my heart fell deeper
Oh, it’s like a burning flame
Yeah
It’s like a burning flame
When my heart fell deeper
Oh, it's like a burning flame
Yeah

[Verse 1]
You can't find where the body goes
It’s just like searching for the concept
That takes you down an old forgotten road
Like it's been told
As it leads you there hopeless
To show you how the water flows
To feel the empty hand of doubt
Is something like a stepping stone

[Chorus]
When my heart fell deeper
I felt troubled
When I felt fever
Like a burning flame when the bright light flickers inside

It's like a burning flame
When my heart fell deeper
When I felt troubled
When I felt fever
Like a burning flame when the bright light flickers inside

[Verse 2]
You’ve been a charmer
A thief with a heart of gold
But you'd be the witness
With your eyes
Who would tell me how to believe when you’ve been fooled
And I see them there
Passengers in a body, hope they feel it too
And the wheels that turn over
And keep burning like an old steam train

[Chorus]
When my heart fell deeper
I felt troubled
When I felt fever
Like a burning flame when my heart felt heavy
I felt troubled and I felt deeper than burning flame

264,Fresh,"[Verse 1]
Now this is a story all about how
My life got flipped turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air

[Verse 2]
In West Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground is where I spent most of my days
Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool
And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
And said ""You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air""

[Verse 3]
I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
I put my Walkman on and said ""I might as well kick it""
First class, yo, this is bad
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
Hmm, this might be all right
But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, and all that
Is this the type of place that they should send this cool cat?
I don't think so, I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the Prince of Bel-Air

[Verse 4]
Well, uh, the plane landed and when I came out
There was a dude, looked like a cop, standing there with my name out
I ain't trying to get arrested yet, I just got here
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared
I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said 'Fresh' and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought ""Nah, forget it, yo, Holmes, to Bel-Air!""
I pulled up to a house about seven or eight
And I yelled to the cabbie ""Yo', Holmes, smell ya later""
Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air",DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince,1985,"[96, 72, 66, 43, 25, 18, 15, 9, 10, 11, 17, 18, 25, 27, 34, 41, 55, 61, 73]",19

You know you stand out in a crowd
But the way that you play
With any man's affections
Should never be allowed
See I consider myself
The one who will show you
I'd go as far as to say
Girl, I ain't leaving here without you
But you better understand
There's only one rule in this game we're going to play

No doubt!
Yo, yo, y'know how we did on The Infamous album, right?
Aight, we gonna do it again son

[Verse 1: Havoc]
Yo, laid up in the cut, watch these rap niggas fuck you up
Dig in shorty guts, get the bitch to set you up
It's the most trifle, 41st Side disciples
Take kindness for a weakness so I won't be so kind to
Niggas comin' through, I gave you birth kid, I'm sonnin' you
The Infamous got PC for days
We runnin' thru townships, fuckin' shit
Kid, we down shit
Hustle mad bricks, Queensbridge no doubt, rep the clique
9-6 droppin' wild on some Benz's
Some next shit, crash bar, ask the God
I remember when loadin' up the gats, beef settlin'
Ghetto peddling the Sonder, shorty dead again
Songs about 'We all around the NC'
Cop the E series, jealous ones envy
Hate to see me but got the nerve to wanna be me
I bleach blind em, you can't see like Ste-vie
I'm on TV, Vidbox and all that
Still in the Bridge, now what's fuckin' with that?

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
To all my Mobb crimey, money-hungry and grimy
Mobb sheisty, Godfather III and Gotti
Rapper Noyd, Ty Maxx and Ty Nitty
Scarface and Gambino, New York City
It's P live and direct, stab ya neck
Ice-pick bloodied up ya whole entire shit
Live shit 1-9-9-6, ask your bitch
My crew run wild, snatch chains and bracelets
Your time's wasted for figuring P
There's two sides of me
Snake niggas obviously, you get lumped somethin' horribly and then we calmly guzzle Spumantely and Dom Pérignonly
Move the crowds over, cruise the fuck out
After GOD drinks had to shoot our fuckin way out
Spark flyin' niggas dyin', bitches cryin' and shout
Mobb niggas to the exit, we out

[Verse 3: Ty Nitty & (Gambino)]
(Ty) 9-6 load up the clips, the Infamous apocalypse
QBC on the L-I-E an sippin' Hennessey
And Remy, V-S-O-P, Ty Nitty jiggy
Eyes forever chinky, up in the Mariott
Tonnes o' hydro, black tuxedo, lay low
The 5-0-migos, the gigolo, what nigga?

[Verse 4: Twin Gambino]
My technique, official white meat
Internal bleeding he felt, heat then cold feet
QBC committee, Ty Nitty hit the safe
The Phillipino's have mad ice and gold plates
We escape, ain't no turnin' back to Stat
Pushin back-to-back acs, gettin' cheddar
Drug smugglin' tri-state, catchin' faith
We don't hesitate, we regulate and evaluate, cut the cake!

Well, I'm back, but this time I'm with my man
And these women are putting their hands
All over his Yamamoto Kanzai sweater that I bought

275,We Are The World,"[Verse 1]
There is a time when we should hear the certain calls
'Cause the world it seems it's right in this line
'Cause there's a chance for taking in needing our own lives
It seems we need nothing at all
I used to feel I should give away my heart
And it shows that fear of needing them
Then I read the headlines and it said they're dying there
And it shows that we must heed instead

[Chorus]
We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me

[Verse 2]
Give in your heart and you will see that someone cares
'Cause you know that they can feed them all
Then I read the paper and it said that you've been denied
And it shows the second we will call

[Chorus]
We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me

[Verse 3]
Now there's a time when we must love them all
And it seems that life, it don't make love at all
But if you'd been there, and I'll love you more and more
It seems in life, i didn't do that

We are the world, the world
We are the children, are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving, let's start giving
There's a chance we're taking

It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me
We are the world, are the world
We are the children, are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving, let's start giving
But there's a chance we're taking, taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day

We are the world, shalom
We are the children, shalingin
We are the ones who make a brighter day, shalom

Help
I have done it again
I have been here many times before
Hurt myself again today
And the worst part is there's no one else to blame
Be my friend
Hold me
Wrap me up
Unfold me
I am small and needy
Warm me up and breathe me

[Verse 1]

I start to feel bad about it
At the same time I can't live my life without it
You say you love me but I doubt it
Just go home ma this room is gettin' crowded
I'm in love I can't help it
You could cut me slack
Every time she leaves she always leave the door cracked
But I can't sleep I wait for her to come back
On that lean, on that morphine got me laxed
How the hell am I supposed to tell her that I love her
When I know that she'll leave me here for another rock n roll mother fucker
I'm real sad but I'm happy when I got her in my covers
Six months ago I got popped by some undercovers and I
Couldn't tell them that my heart is broken from my
Lover
That's why I had the drugs in the car Sir
Don't know how the fuck I'm gon' depart her
It broke my pride but it really broke my heart first
How the hell I'm supposed to live like Arthur
Now I'm drowning and my head is under water
I hope she learns from the lessons that I taught her
I couldn't get her what them other dudes bought her
It didn't matter cause I had a better offer
What do I do now cause I lost her
Said what the fuck do I do cause I lost her

[Hook]

Alone again
I'm alone again
I don't think shes comin' back tomorrow

[Verse 2]

Heavy eyelids steady closing shut
If I never get her here then I'll never have enough
And if you say that you sorry then I call you bluff
And I don't live for tomorrow cause life is tough
But it's blood, love is love
What the fuck am I to do when push comes to shove
Nothing
I'm feigning like a fiend and I'm leaning with my lean
From methazine and morphine
I'm already fucked up and if she try to call me back
Then I guess I lucked up
What the fuck, where am I, I don't know cause I'm
Losing
All I know is this car keeps moving
I-95 and I'm barely alive
If I die tell her that I tried
Already burnt but I'm trying to get more high
Listen to my elders cause they probably more wise

I got a fever
An inclination
That's what I got
You turn the heat on me
Some like it hot
Look what we started
A revolution
Take another shot
We like the way it burns
Some like it hot

[Chorus: Neon Hitch]
I'm from that old school
I play it real cool
Cooler than the ice on my Jameson
Still cold
But I like it hot
But I like it hot
But I like it hot
But I like it hot

[Rap Interlude: Kinetics]
Yeah, Kinetics
She carries a lie
She carefully cries
Happy in photos but nobody notices
Someone who's lonely and barely alive
When Marilyn died, the entire cemetery was live
She was still naked inside of a casket
And sipping a flask when carried inside

[Verse 2: Neon Hitch]
Call out the engine
Ring up the station
A gypsy on the block
Love burns us up the most
Like it or not
I'm on the 301
The train to paradise
That's where it stops
Red lights make us sweat
Some like it hot

285,One Night In Bangkok,"[Verse 1]
Bangkok - Oriental setting
And the city don't know
What the city is getting
The creme de la creme of
The chess world in a show
With everything
But Yul Brynner
Times flies -
Doesn't seem a minute
Since the Tirolean Spa
Had the chess boys in it
All change - don't you know that when you play at this level
There's no ordinary venue
It's Iceland or the Philippines or Hastings or...
Or this place!

[Hook]
One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
And if you're lucky then the God's a she
I can feel an angel sliding up to me

[Verse 2]
One town's very like another
When your head's down over your pieces, brother
It's a drag, it's a bore
It's really such a pity
To be looking at the board not looking at the city
Whaddya mean?
You've seen one crowded, polluted, stinking town
Tea girls
Warm and sweet (warm, sweet)
Some are set up in the Somerset Maugham suite
Get Thai'd! You're talking to a tourist
Whose every moves's among the purest
I get my kicks above the waistline, sunshine

[Hook]
One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walkin' next to me

[Verse 3]
Siam's gonna be the witness
To the ultimate test of cerebral fitness
This grips me more than would a muddy old river
Or reclining Buddah
And thank God I'm only watching the game
Controlling it
I don't see you guys rating the kind of mate
I'm contemplating
I'd let you watch I would invite you
But the queens we use would not excite you
So you'd better go back to your bars
Your temples, your massage parlors

[Hook]
One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a God in every golden cloister
A little flesh, a little history
I can feel an angel sliding up to me
One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walkin' next to me",Murray Head,1985,"[87, 79, 58, 36, 23, 15, 7, 3, 5, 5, 6, 9, 12, 19, 27, 35, 48, 84, 57, 77, 70, 80, 81]",23

When your world, it starts to fall apart
Look deep within, within your lonely heart

When you tell your story
Make sure your story is right
Every little single word is true
See what love can do

The world would be so happy, if we would all just get along
I want to see it, a smile on every face

Lyrics by: Paolo Onesa

On the day that you were born, stars lit up the sky
You could see forever on the comet flashing by
Sometimes there is no reason why something just don't happen twice
Why we're here tonight, Oooh...

People will talk because they love you
They wish they had you, the way I do
I've been lucky in love, Oh I've been so lucky with you...
They know it's true

People will say the things they want to
But they don't know you the way I do
I've been lucky it's true...
Oh I've been so lucky with you

Everyone has a reason to pray
Our religion to make it through the day
And may be controversial, life's not a rehearsal
We are here so let's take it away

I'm lucky in love the day you kissed me
The way you touch me and said you miss me
I've been lucky inlove
Oh I've been so lucky with you...

Everyone has a reason to pray
Our religion to make it through the day
And may be controversial, life's not a rehearsal
Now we are here so let's take it away

Now people can say all they want to
Let's keep'em talking but who I belong to
I've been lucky in love, oh yes I've been so lucky
It's true, yeah, lucky in love with you...",Paolo Onesa,1985,"[99, 86, 76, 52, 38, 38, 40, 42, 47, 54, 65]",11

295,Freak-A-Ristic,"She's hot, she's freak-a-ristic

Last night when I walked into the joint
Everyone felt the sweat, oh, so wet
Walked into the crowd, lunged in with the freaks
Everyone doing the dance, I even saw the freak of the week

She was wearing those red shoes, everybody replied, ""She's hot""
And as she riddled to the rhythm of a beat, everybody fell apart, woah
All of a sudden, she turned her head, eyes full of flame
I was hypnotized, mesmerized, I didn't even know my name

Well, well, well, and she was the finest thing I had ever seen
Fresh as she could be
Freaky lovely thing, turned on me
She's freak-a-ristic, she's freak-a-ristic, hot

She took me by the hand, led me to the back
Almost had a heart attack
She took me to a dark space in her place
We kinda made it our own space

Then she grabbed me around my neck and pulled my head to hers
That's when I felt my blood pressure surges and blown
Take this fancy home where we'll never be all alone
And turn it out 'cause you're freak-a-ristic

She was the finest thing I had ever seen
Fresh as she could be, freaky lovely thing, turned on me
She's freak-a-ristic, she's a freak, brilliant thing
She's freak-a-ristic, she's a freak-a-ristic thing

She's freak-a-ristic
Hypnotized me, mesmerized me
She's freak-a-ristic
Love the way she moves

She's just the finest thing
I had ever seen, fresh as she could be
Freaky lovely thing, turned on me

She's freak-a-ristic
Ooh, she's fresh, she's fine
She's freak-a-ristic
Cannot get her off my mind

She's freak-a-ristic
Sweet tender thing, tender thing

She's hot, yeah, she's a freak

Yeah, she's freak-a-ristic

If I could change anything, I wouldn't erase it (I wouldn't erase it)
Came back on a private plane and upgraded (I made it)
It had to be destiny, it had to be the recipe
Had to be the formula, I'm not normal, I told you (I told you)

You would've ran off with it and tried to convince me it was karma

Watching for the coins to fall

From the Ching

By the stream
Stretching in the rocks
Tiger on the mountaintop

Walking on the Chinese Wall
Watching for the coins to fall

Now the sun is rising in the east
Looking for my golden fleece
Ivory skin, scarlet color deep
Lips that burn but do not speak

Three misty nights
Waiting by the shore
May be that my lover
Comes no more

Red chamber dream
From the sky above
Ancient tales of hidden
Chinese love

On the Chinese Wall
Watching for the coins to fall

Blue red silk burning on my chest
Go to sleep but not to rest
Stepping stones on the yellow sea
Dreaming she'll be there for me

Come down the clouds
To the sea of flames
From the mountain
Hear the cry of pain

Red chamber dream
From the sky above
Ancient tales of hidden
Chinese love

Love could hurt like this
I picture her there in your arms
Loving every kiss

You said there was someone else

Yeah, I'm the brown hottie with the body looking like Rum Spice
So nice they don't want it twice, niggas try to wife it
I love my life too much
Never caught up with possessiveness, stresses and such and such

[Verse 1]
Relax, as the aura ease you
In the flesh, let the physical please you
I'm a genie in a bottle of Malibu
Grant you one wish, if you cute you can have two
It's feasible if you pay your fee for me
If you gon' feast your eyes on the prize to be with me
Manifesting your fantasies and requesting colours of panties
Damn, niggas is lusty, baby moms can't stand me
Chill ma' - He ain't come with me to Miami
He gave a trip as a gift while you clocking me on the Grammy's
His bitches be tryna see if they somewhere their man could be
If they not then they plan to be, you think he is gon' marry me
High price bitch wanting high price things
Yelling bling bling, bitch please, fuck a wedding ring
What you know about that?
Not the bitch you wanna go and run your mouth at
Run up on me in the street, yo I doubt that
You don't really want beef, where the cows at? (Heffer!)

Everywhere I go is a show the way I glow
My goddess spirit, you can feel it amongst the hoes
As they stare at me slowly, head to French-tipped toes
Bitches seem to think they wavey but I'm rocking the boat
Started with slow strokes, ended in low blows
Knock the shit out them boots, left a tree limp on your timbo
Stink faced bimbos always drinking soda
I'm on a fruit diet so the pussy got no odour
Signal incense in the crib make sexy niggas come over
Young Calypso with weave, got tricks up my sleeve
Put a spell up on Hakeem, you could ask Rasheed
I had him topless feeding me grapes without the seeds
(I'm ruthless) But never been no easy B
Supreme bitch, got these niggas lining up like fiends
Five star, ain't gotta yelp me for the guarantee
I'm mighty healthy, pretty toned - rip up the warranty!

That shit cray, that shit dead, that shit fake, plastic head
Cassius Clay at his head, atta boy, atta kid
I'ma need a napkin, cook 'em up
And he gon' need an Aspirin, hook him up
Niggas was busy scrappin', put 'em up
I was too busy rapping, good as fuck
Niggas don't act like grown ups
When niggas don't get to grow up
Niggas don't wanna throw hands
That's what made me wanna throw up
But these young gunners ain't nothin' but young stunners
And niggas see you as come ups so niggas just wanna run up
Niggas asking, ""What up?"" I said on my soul, I'm a hundred
My niggas stay in the low end, the others stay in the hundreds
My daddy throw me the hands and my momma told me to love 'em
My neighbors told me they hunting, I hope I make it through summer
They stole one of my niggas, I should have seen that one coming
My priest told me it's angels, my niggas told me its nothing
I'm thinking about my nigga he thinking before he die
I'm going to war with fate and I'm going to war with God
I'm burning up all the papers 'cause all the reporters lied
I called up my lil' homie, bought him a .45
Brown boys are dying and none of 'em were for business
And all of em' love they momma and all of they mommas miss 'em
And this shit is just stupid, this shit is fucking senseless
The news shouldn't support it, this shit is getting expensive

And having a good time
Who am I to cast a shadow?
Who am I?

I looked Death in the face last night
I saw him in a mirror

He told me not to worry
He told me just to take my time

We close our eyes
And the world has turned around again
We close our eyes and dream
And another year has come and gone
We close our eyes
And the world has turned around again
We close our eyes and dream

And if you come to me
And if you touch my hand
I might just slip away
I might just disappear—who am I

And if you think I'm worth it
And if you think it's not too late
We might start falling
If we don't try too hard
We might start falling in love

We close our eyes
And the world has turned around again
We close our eyes and dream
And another year has come and gone
We close our eyes
And the world has turned around again
We close our eyes and dream

We're on a healing path
We're on a rollercoaster ride
That can never turn back
And if you love me
And if you really try
To make the seconds count
And we can close our eyes

We close our eyes

And he, he had tremolo deep
In the back of his black eye sockets

Into the pitch black pool?""
And I said, ""I don't know, I don't know, I don't know""

And they were unpredictable

Sometimes they'd only last five minutes and sometimes weeks

Because I had nowhere to go one long weekend

You're not giving me a chance
To ever really be your man

You say you're fine, you're moving on

329,Days Are Numbers (The Traveller),"The traveller is always leaving town
He never has the time to turn around
And if the road he's taken isn't leading anywhere
He seems to be completely unaware

The traveller is always leaving home
The only kind of life he's ever known
When every moment seems to be
A race against the time
There's always one more mountain left to climb

Days are numbers
Watch the stars
We can only see so far
Someday, you'll know where you are
Remember
Days are numbers
Count the stars
We can only go so far
One day, you'll know where you are

The traveller awaits the morning tide
He doesn't know what's on the other side
But something deep inside of him
Keeps telling him to go
He hasn't found a reason to say no

The traveller is only passing through
He cannot understand your point of view
Abandoning reality, unsure of what he'll find
The traveller in me is close behind

Days are numbers
Watch the stars
We can only see so far
Someday, you'll know where you are
Remember
Days are numbers
Count the stars
We can only go so far
One day, you'll know where you are",The Alan Parsons Project,1985,"[99, 71, 72, 78, 90]",5

Bucka-bucka-bucka-bucka-bucka-bucka, haha!
You know the deal; it's just me, yo
Beats by Su-Primo for all of my people, Negroes and Latinos
And even the gringos

[Verse 1]
Yo, check it
1 for Charlie Hustle, 2 for Steady Rock
3 for the forth-coming live future shock
It's 5 dimensions, 6 senses
7 firmaments of heaven and hell
8 million stories to tell
9 planets faithfully keepin' orbit, with the probable 10th
The universe expands length
The body of my text possess extra strength
Power-lift the powerless up out of this towering inferno
My ink so hot it burn through the journal
I'm blacker than midnight on Broadway and Myrtle
Hip-Hop passed all your tall social hurdles
Like the nationwide projects-prison-industry complex
Working-class poor, better keep your alarm set
Streets too loud to ever hear freedom ring
Say evacuate your sleep, it's dangerous to dream
For ch-ching, cats get the ""cha-pow!"" You dead now
Killing fields need blood to graze the cash cow
It's a numbers game, but shit don't add up somehow
Like I got 16 to 32 bars to rock it
But only 15% of profits ever see my pockets
Like 69 billion in the last 20 years
Spent on national defense, but folks still live in fear
Like nearly half of America's largest cities is one-quarter black
That's why they gave Ricky Ross all the crack
16 ounces to a pound, 20 more to a ki
A 5 minute sentence hearing and you're no longer free
40% of Americans own a cell phone
So they can hear everything that you say when you ain't home
I guess Michael Jackson was right, you are not alone
Rock your hardhat, black, 'cause you in the Terrordome
Full of hard niggas, large niggas, dice-tumblers
Young teens and prison greens facing life numbers
Crack mothers, crack babies, and AIDS patients
Young bloods can't spell but they could rock you in PlayStation
This New Math is whipping motherfuckers' ass
You want to know how to rhyme, you better learn how to add
It's mathematics

Yo, it's 1 universal law, but 2 sides to every story
3 strikes and you biddin' for life, mandatory
4 MCs murdered in the last 4 years

Yo it's 6 million ways to die, from the 7 deadly thrills
8-year-olds getting found with 9mils
It's 10 PM, where your seeds at? What's the deal?
He on the hill pumping krills to keep they bellies filled
Light in the ass with heavy steel, sights on the pretty shit in life
Young soldiers trying to earn their next stripe
When the average minimum wage is $5.15
You best believe you've got to find a new grind to get cream
The white unemployment rate is nearly more than triple for black
Some front-liners got their gun in your back
Bubbling crack, jewel theft and robbery to combat poverty
And end up in the global jail economy
Stiffer stipulations attached to each sentence
Budget cutbacks but increased police presence
And even if you get out of prison still livin'
Join the other 5 million under state supervision
This is business; no faces, just lines and statistics
From your phone, your Zip Code, to SSI digits
The system break man, child, and women into figures
2 columns for ""Who is"" and ""Who ain't niggas""
Numbers is hard and real and they never have feelings
But you push too hard, even numbers got limits
Why did one straw break the camel's back?
Here's the secret
The million other straws underneath it
It's all mathematics

Oh, I can't fight this feeling any longer
And yet, I'm still afraid to let it flow
What started out as friendship, has grown stronger
I only wish I had the strength to let it show
I tell myself that I can't hold out forever
I said there is no reason for my fear
'Cause I feel so secure when we're together
You give my life direction
You make everything so clear

I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars, forever
Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashing through your door
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore

My life has been such a whirlwind since I saw you
I've been running round in circles in my mind
And it always seems that I'm following you, girl

(Now rapping basketball -- Number 1, Kurtis Blow)
Basketball is my favorite sport
I like the way they dribble up and down the court
Just like I'm the king on the microphone
So is Dr. J and Moses Malone
I like slam dunks, take me to the hoop
My favorite play is the alley-oop
I like the pick-and-roll, I like the give-and-go
'Cause it's basketball, uh, Mister Kurtis Blow

They're playing basketball
We love that basketball
They're playing basketball

[Verse 2]
I used to go to dinner, then take the girl
To see Tiny play against Earl The Pearl
And Wilt, Big O, and Jerry West
Play basketball at it's very best
Basketball has always been my thing
I like Magic, Bird, and Bernard King
And number 33, my man Kareem
Is the center on my starting team

(To the hoop, y'all, watch out, watch out
In yo' face, now here comes the rest)

[Verse 3]
Clyde, Rick Barry, and Pistol Pete
Now these players could never be beat
Isiah, and Iceman too
Just give 'em the ball, and then you chalk up two
Dantley and Wilkins are on the scene
And Ralph Sampson is really mean
Bill Russell didn't take no junk
And Darryl Dawkins got a monster dunk

[Verse 4]
Tell me, were you in the joint
The night Wilt scored 100 points?
Or when Celtics won titles back-to-back
And didn't give nobody no kind of slack?
Or when Dr. J shook the whole damn team
With moves that came right out of a dream?
Or when Willis Reed stood so tall
Playing D with desire? It's basketball!

[Chorus]
They're playing basketball
We love that basketball
They're playing basketball
We love that basketball

[Verse 5]
I get the ball and then I go and play
Like a superstar in the NBA
The forwards, the centers, and all the guards
The ones you see on the bubblegum cards

351,Lonely In Love,"Some say that love is its own
Love is its own reward
But I can't help but believe
There's got to be more

A man needs a woman
To have and to hold
To love him in body
As well as in soul
I need your desire
Where did the fire go

I keep trying to sleep
But sleep won't be mine tonight
There's so much sorrow inside
And, baby, I don't know why

I give you your freedom
I give you my love
I give all I have
Every time that we touch
I don't know, baby
Maybe I give too much

Now I'm lonely in love
Why must I be lonely in love
I'm so lonely in love
Baby why must I be lonely
Why must I be lonely in love

I know that love carries no
She carries no guarantees
But still I can't seem to find
A reason that I can believe in

You said to be patient
And give you some room
You said you had changes
You need to work through
But the longer I wait
The farther I feel from you

Now I'm lonely in love
Why must I be lonely in love
I'm so lonely in love
Baby, why must I be lonely
Why must I be lonely in love

I'm so lonely in love
Why must I be lonely in love

353,I'm Through With Love,"I put away your photograph
And turn out all the lights
But I can't seem to make myself forget
'Cause every time I close my eyes
And see your face again
I realize that's all that I have left

I'm through with love
I'm through with pain
Don't wanna feel that way again
'Cause if you're gone for good
I'll never be the same

I thought that what we had was real
But maybe I'm a fool
Who only sees the things he wants to see
'Cause it seems that when I need you most
I find myself alone
And I know that's not the way love's supposed to be

I'm through with love
And sad goodbyes
Can't take the lows
Don't want those highs
This heart needs time to mend
I'm through with love, my friend

Well, maybe someday if the feeling comes again
I won't remember how it hurt but until then

I'm through with love
I'm through with pain
Don't wanna feel that way again
'Cause if you're gone for good
I'll never be the same

I'm through with love
And sad goodbyes
Can't take the lows
Don't want those highs

Till I can feel again

And I'll miss the laughs we shared
I'll miss staying up 'till midnight
And the times when everything felt right

When the blood drips I feel nothing
I can't discuss it I need something to numb it

I'm sorry baby find me where the pain be
In the dark creating I see the light and its fading

Woah, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy, but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (Yah I said it)
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food
Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you
Fuck you too, woo!

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'
You mighta went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time
I ain't no gangster but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of nines
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My 12 days of Christmas was nothin' but lies (I)
Run at you hard like a sumo (Sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (Chulo)
I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno (Woo)
Bitch I'm a dog, call me Cujo (Rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw 4 like a Uno (Bup)
Cállate boca mejor, maricón, little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)
They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now
Shit get relevant 'til 'nother beef die down
In truth, a nigga just really want me tied down
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope (Yeah)
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
Nigga, wrong way, wrong road (Woo, woo)
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (Vroom!)

[Pre-Verse: Eminem]
I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em
Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference?
I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man, I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I've been eatin' long enough, man, my stomach should be full
I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me
Fuck you think? (Woo!)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I got a couple of mansions
Still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghost writers
But to these kids it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop?""
I said, ""I don't have any answers.""
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, ""What a wonderful feeling!""
""We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!""
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap
Let's recap, way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They know what button to press or what lever to pull
To get me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya digs in the fuckin' back, ho (Get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least 70 or 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I wrote 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain to pour
In that drought, y'all been prayin' for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboy

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas & Eminem]
So y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice",Eminem,1985,"[94, 76, 61, 33, 30, 34, 38, 42, 45, 53, 61, 72]",12

You saw me standing by the old
Corner of main street
And the lights are flashing on your window sill
All alone ain't much fun
So you're looking for the thrill
And you know just what it takes and where to go

[Chorus: Jesse Hughes]
Don't say a prayer for me now
Save it 'til the morning after
No, don't say a prayer for me now
Save it 'til the morning after

[Verse 2: Jesse Hughes]
Feel the breeze deep on the inside
Look you down into your well
If you can, you'll see the world in all his fire
Take a chance
Like all dreamers can't find another way
You don't have to dream at all, just live a day

[Chorus: Jesse Hughes]
Don't say a prayer for me now
Save it 'til the morning after
No, don't say a prayer for me now
Save it 'til the morning after
Save it 'til the morning after
Save it 'til the morning after

Pretty looking road
I try to hold the rising floods that fill my skin
Don't ask me why I'll keep my promise
Melt the ice
And you wanted to dance so I asked you to dance
But fear is in your soul
Some people call it a one night stand
But we can call it paradise

Don't say a prayer for me now
Save it 'til the morning after
No, don't say a prayer for me now
Save it 'til the morning after

358,Change,"[Intro: J. Cole]
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days, yeah
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I like this tone

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, my intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I sit in silence and find whenever I meditate
My fears alleviate, my tears evaporate
My faith don't deviate, ideas don't have a date
But see I'm growing and getting stronger with every breath
Bringing me closer to Heaven's doors with every step
As we speak I'm at peace, no longer scared to die
Most niggas don't believe in God and so they terrified
It's either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell
Asking the Father for forgiveness, got 'em overwhelmed (Please, God, I want to go to Heaven)
As if He's spiteful like them white folks that control the jail
See I believe if God is real, He'd never judge a man
Because He knows us all and therefore He would understand
The ignorance that make a nigga take his brother life
The bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife

[Chorus: J. Cole]
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Yeah, my chosen religion
Jesus piece frozen from sinnin'
Doin' dirt, hoping to God, He know my intentions
To see a million 'fore I see a casket
I got a baby on the way, know he gon' be a bastard
I'm living fast like I'm in a drag race, how that cash taste
When I was a senior, I was ballin' on my classmates
Niggas put three bullets in my car, one hit the gas tank
Know I got a angel cause I'm supposed to have a halo
Right now, my lifestyle destined for a federal facility
For my ability to make them birds fly
Fiends wanna get higher than a bird's eye view
And who am I to tell a nigga what to do?
I just supply, it's economics
My business ain't got the suit and tie
Keep a pistol at all times, niggas want what's mine
I can't oblige, dog, I work too hard
So reach for it, get referred to God, I'm going hard, nigga

[Chorus: J. Cole]
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from—

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Yeah, prodigal son, got a new gun
This one don't run out of ammo
Lately been working on my handles
Can I ball, become a star and remain my self?
If I fall, dust it off and regain my self
Fuck 'em all, they don't know all the pain I felt
I'm in awe, after all the fame I felt, I evolved
I no longer bury demons, I be a vessel for the truth until I'm barely breathing, I'm singing

[Bridge: Ari Lennox & J. Cole]
Life is all about the evolution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
You can dream but don't neglect the execution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Time is short that's what somebody told me
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Too short to keep following your homies
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more

[Bridge: J. Cole]
I reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands
All of a sudden niggas pop a trunk and then we scram
Finger on trigger make a little nigga understand
What it's like to finally be the motherfuckin' man
Eyes wide that's from the power that the coward feels
Niggas die over bitches, disrespect, and dollar bills
Bloodshed that turned the city to a battlefield
I call it poison, you call it real (pop, pop, pop, pop)
That's how you feel?

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
Pistols be poppin' and niggas drop in a heartbeat
Scattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete
A body laid on the concrete
Look, somebody laid on the concrete
No time for that, ain't no lookin' back, cause I'm running too
I made it home, I woke up and turned on the morning news
Overcame with a feeling I can't explain
Cause that was my nigga James that was slain, he was 22
(Last night at around...) He was 22
(22 year old black male, suspect, reporting live...)

[Outro: J. Cole]
(I swear to God, bruh)
We're gathered here today...
(I swear to God)
To mourn the life of James McMillan Jr
(I swear to God—nigga, I'ma kill them niggas, man)
A tragedy, another tragedy in the black community
(I promise you, bro...)
We got to do better, people
22 years old, this boy was too young
(I promise you, bro, I'ma kill them niggas, yo...)
Our condolences go to his family, our prayers
(I'ma kill them niggas myself...)
We know he's in a better place
We know he's in a better place
But this has got to end, ladies and gentleman
We've got to come together, this is—this is beyond words

364,High School Nights,"You wake up in the morning and another night's gone
You tumble out of bed and turn the radio on
But you just can't think about the day to come
Cause you're thinking about them high school nights

Making all the moves, gotta do it in style
It merely makes the high school day worthwhile
When the work piles high
And the day drags by
And you never see the end in sight

I remember those, high school nights
We had it made them, high school nights
Those were the days them, high school nights
You will remember all your life

The day moves ahead about a light-year long
You hurry through the halls singing your school song
But you just can't follow what the hell's going on
Cause you're thinking 'bout them high school nights

Staring out the window in a daydream world
Looking at the parking lot, checking out the girls
There's a lesson going on, but it ain't getting heard
Cause you're wondering what'll happen tonight

I remember those, high school nights
I'm gonna miss those, high school nights
They were the best those, high school nights
You will remember all your life

High school nights, we had it made
Them high school nights, those were the days
Them high school nights, could be the best days of your life

That's how it used to be, pity it couldn't last
Better days have stopped the flow of parties and livin' fast

The dean's in his office and the writing's on the wall
Some of us will make it and someone's gonna fall
But it really don't matter cause we're gonna have a ball
When we hit another high school night

I still remember those high school nights
We had it made them, high school nights
Those were the days them, high school nights
You will remember all your life

High school nights. I'm gonna miss those high school nights
They were the best, those high school nights
Could be the best days of your life

Those were the days, them high school nights

We can hide in the dark

There's a beast that lives inside you
And it's screaming to get out
Like the beat of a heart
Like the beat of a heart

Don't look behind
Cause a tear that never dries can only make you blind
You've got to try
Cause the future's never, never going to die

There's a beast that lives inside you
And it's screaming to get out
It's a storm that's never ending
It's a truth without a doubt

Tonight we run
We can hide in the dark
Till the moon steals the light from the sun

There's a beast that lives inside you
And it's screaming, let me out
It's a storm that's never ending
It's a truth without a doubt

But pain will always shout to you

With a family to provide for
But one thing he must keep alive

[Chorus:]
Will the wolf survive?[x2]

[Verse 2:]
Drifting by the roadside
Climbs a strong and aging face
Wants to make some honest pay
Losing to the rainstorm
He's got two strong legs to guide him
Two strong arms keep him alive
Will the wolf survive?
Standing in the pouring rain
All alone in a world that's changed
Running scared now forced to hide
In a land where he once stood with pride
But he'll find his way by the morning light
Sounds across the nation
Coming from your hearts and minds
Battered drums and old guitar
Singing songs of passion
It's the truth that they all look for
Something they must keep alive

[Chorus:]
Will the wolf survive?[x3]",Waylon Jennings,1985,"[94, 87, 78, 79, 84]",5

[Couplet 1]
J'ai fumé des kilos d'herbe, crachés tant d'CO2
Traîne des problèmes d'puis l'CE2
Les vrais, les demi-vrais j'peux pas plaire aux deux
Une vie dans la gloire en vaut deux
Bitch une bonne parole en vaut deux
J'sens l'fric son odeur, le vice son horreur, vu d'ici tu parais douteux
Mets l'Ruinart dans la coupe, j'ai mon Beretta semi-auto
PD j'viens du hood, trois sur l'carrelage, deux sur la moto
J'suis sur la photo, aussi vrai qu'mes potos
On attend rien du Loto, entravés dans des roseaux
Ma crédulité bute ma raison, y'a trois kil' à oim au réseau
J'vrille j'mets l'douze dans l'étau
J'le découpe à 1,20
Demain on va s'lever tôt, s'entasser dans le Vito
Dérober les métaux, bitchiz ferme tes rideaux
Et puis j'ai pas l'temps d'puis p'tit j'ai les dents
Ouais d'puis p'tit j'ai les dents
J'aurais jamais dû leur accorder d'temps, mais il y a des gens qu'j'aimais d'trop

[Pré-refrain]
J'fais des va-et-vient, j'tourne en rond
Remercie ma putain d'étoile si j'm'en tire avant

Oui c'est la vie si j'me fais shooter embrasse les homies

Rentre et ressort, on libère des potos dans des écrans de fumées

Rentre dans ta maison quand t'es couché, puto on va pas voler les fauchés

Mr. Texas Tea
People call me rich cause I got mo' money
I got more cheddar then some super sized nachos
Got cash flow like Robert has De Niros
I use more greens than Vincent van Gogh
I make the baker bake my bread out of dough
No no don't eat it though it'll make you ill
There ain't no flour in a hundred dollar bill

[Hook]
He's Tex Richman
Everybody listen
Just how great it is to be him
He's the greatest
You're the lamest
Muppets are a waste of time, oh can't you see

Yeah its funny in a rich man's world
When I use a piece of string
I use a string of pearls
If something's for sale consider it sold
I got so much gold I gold plate my gold
I even got a guy to gold plate my cat
I don't regret much but I do regret that
If I could start over I'd do it all the same
But I wouldn't gold plate little Twinkles again

[Hook]

I recall a heart breaking story
About my own 10th birthday party
Should've been glorious day for me
I'd have been happy as can be
But the Muppets were there to put on a show
They started to dance they were telling their jokes
I didn't laugh I didn't know how
Then my friends they all turned around
And they laughed at me
They laughed at me
And I hate you Muppets so

The old man is down the road

He got the voices speak in riddles
He got the eye as black as coal
He got a suitcase covered with rattlesnake hide
And he stands right in the road

You got to hidey-hide
You got to jump up, run away
You got to hidey-hidey-hide
The old man is down the road

He make the river call your lover
He make the barking of the hound
Put a shadow 'cross the window

378,Method Of Modern Love,"No rules for foolish hearts?

It only takes a moment to rewrite
Every single page, you never know
When you feel your eyes lock and engage
Changing time forever

There?s no sense of reason why we?re shot
With a bolt of blue
And there?s no par for the heart to follow
No-one?s side that you have to choose

No rules for foolish hearts
Never looking too hard
That?s the method of modern love
One touch is not enough
When you start, you can?t stop
That?s the method of modern love

You know there?s more, there?s more to modern love
There?s more, there?s more to modern love
You know there?s more, there?s more, there?s more to love
There?s more, there?s more, there?s more, there?s more

This primitive connection that we have
No resistance to it?s a design
And it?s our protection, leads to me
And it leads to you

Captured in an instant, saw the sparks
Multiple and fall
As we align for the next sensation

Coming close, what you waiting for?

No rules for foolish hearts
Never looking too hard
That?s the method of modern love
One touch is not enough
When you start, you can?t stop
That?s the method of modern love

You know there?s more, there?s more to modern love
There?s more, there?s more to modern love
You know there?s more, there?s more, there?s more to love
There?s more, there?s more, there?s more, there?s more

We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man

Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?

Forever (ya know what I mean?)

So we living life like a video (video)
Where the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold and the music is always good
And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
And they hop they pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today, 'cause there's no tomorrow
Just a picture perfect day that last a whole lifetime
And it never ends cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So let's just stay in the moment, smoke some weed, drink some wine
Reminisce, talk some shit, forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark they can't erase, neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut, I'll be fine
I'm forever young

Fear not when, fear not why, fear not much while we're alive
Life is for living, not living uptight, 'till you're somewhere up in the sky
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye's
Are not for legends, I'm forever young, my name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves, over Pyrex pots
My name shall be passed down to generations
While debating up in barbershops
Young slung, hung here, showed that a nigga from here
With a little ambition, just what we can become here (yeah)

Don't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby

Smiling at everyone

Out on the road today
I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac

Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go but...

Yeah, what's up man?
There goes that girl they call Roxanne, she's all stuck up
Why do you say that?
'Cause she wouldn't give a guy like me no rap

[Verse 1: Kangol Kid]
Man, she was walking down the street so I said ""Hello
I'm Kangol from UTFO."" And she said ""So?""
And I said ""So!? Baby don't you know?
I can sing, rap, and dance in just one show
'Cause I'm Kangol, Mr. Sophisticata
As far as I know ain't nobody greater
From beginning to end and to beginning
I never lose because I'm all about winning
But if I was to lose I wouldn't be upset
'Cause I'm not a gambler, I don't bet
I don't be in no casino, and baby while you knizzow
The izzi is the grizzeat Kizzangizzo.""
I thought she'd be impressed and give me devious rap
I thought I had her caught inside my sinister trap
I thought it'd be a piece of cake but it was nothing like that
I guess that's what I get for thinking, ain't that right, black?
Then crizzi to gizzone and seen number izzone
Crizzin ricking tizza of mizzac mic dizza
With the bang bang, brother I feel bad
But I ain't committing suicide for no crab
Calling her a crab is just a figure of speech
'Cause she's an apple, a pear, a plum, and a peach
I thought I had it in the palm of my hand
But man, oh man, if I was grand I'd bang Roxanne

[Hook]
Roxanne, Roxanne, can't you understand?
Roxanne, Roxanne, I wanna be your man

[Verse 2: EMD]
Yo Kangol, I don't think that you're dense
But you went about the matter with no experience
You should know, she doesn't need a guy like you
She needs a guy like me with a high IQ
And she'll take to my rap, 'cause my rap's the best
The educated rapper MD will never fess
So when I met her, I wasted no time
But stuck up Roxanne paid me no mind
She thought my name was Barry, I told her it was Gary
She said she didn't like it so she chose to call me Barry
She said she'd love to marry, my baby she would carry
And if she had a baby, she'd name the baby Harry
Her mother's name is Mary, which is really quite contrary
Her face is really hairy, and you can say it's scary
She lives in Mt. Airy, her father's a fairy
His wife's a secretary, his son's in military
They forced him to enlist, I guess it wasn't voluntary
His daughter's name is Sherry, his sons are Tom and Jerry
Jerry had the flu but it was only temporary
Back in January or was it February?
But every time I say this rhyme it makes me kinda weary
It's only customary to give this commentary
Some say it's bad, some say it's legendary
You search it all you want, try your local library
You'll never find a rhyme like this in any dictionary
But do you know, after all that
All I received was a pat on my back
That's what you get, it happened to me
Ain't that right Mixmaster I-C-E

[Hook]
Roxanne, Roxanne
Roxanne, Roxanne

[Verse 3: Doctor Ice]
You thought you had her roped, you thought you was Cupid
But EMD, your rap was plain stupid
I know you're educated, but when will you learn?
Not all girls want to be involved with bookworms
You gotta be strong in a way she can't resist
So educated rapper, huh, bust this

Since she's a new girl around the block
I had to let her know I was the debonair Doc
I said ""I'd like to speak with you if I can
And if I'm correct then your name is Roxanne.""
She said ""How'd you know my name?"" I said ""It's getting around
Right now baby you're the talk of the town
Please let me walk you to the corner, my rap will be brief.""
She said ""I've seen you before, you look like a thief.""
I said ""Me? The Doc? A hood, a rock?
Running 'round the street robbing people on the block?
Nah, that's not my style, to crime I'm not related
As far as I'm concerned I'm too sophisticated.""
Then it seemed I got through 'cause she cracked a smile
That let me know my rap was worth her while
She said ""You call yourself a doctor?"" I said ""This is true.""
She said ""Explain to me really what doctors must do.""
I said ""This is very rare 'cause I don't say this every day
There's a million medical skills a doctor displays
Dermatology is treatment of the skin
Infected and you'll see me and you'll know you're again
There's enthesiology, ophthalmology
Internal medicine and plastic surgery
Orthopedic surgery and pathology
A disease involves a change of your body.""
She said ""Ooooh, that's very unique.""
Gave me her number and kissed me on the cheek
She said she had to go but she'd be back by 8
Told me call her at 9 to arrange a date

[EMD]
Did you take her to the beach?

[Doctor Ice]
That's what we planned
But she stood me up, Roxanne, Roxanne

[Hook]
Roxanne, Roxanne, I wanna be your man
Roxanne, Roxanne, and here's our gameplan

[UTFO]
The beat is here, so we will reveal it
And if you think it's soft, then Roxanne feel it!

Did you ever come up lame
When you played the game of love
My baby she likes to hurt me

It's worse than broken bones
Worse than open wounds
My baby she likes playing dirty

She kicked me when I was down
Now I can't get up
Looks like I'm gonna need a stretcher again boys

Cause she broke my heart
She bust my soul
I've been injured in the game of love
But I like girls and rock n' roll
I've been injured in the game of love

I know you put your guard down
Before the gun sounds
C'mon babe I wanna score tonight
Because the game was fun
Now it's 4th and 1
C'mon baby don't say no tonight
Cause when the night is through
I am still be wanting you
And I gotta walk all the way home tonight

Cause she broke my heart

You say ""Oh, it's nothing at all.""
Heart's racing outta control
And you knew that I couldn't let it go
You used to be this boy I loved
And I used to be this girl of your dreams
Who knew the course of this one drive injured us fatally?
You took the best years of my life
I took the best years of your life
Felt like love struck me in the night
I prayed that love don't strike twice

[Refrain]
Red lipstick, rose petals, heartbreak
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes, tuxedo, fast cars
A James Dean on the low

[Chorus]
What's love without tragedy?
What's love without tragedy?
(Marilyn Monroe)
What's love without tragedy?
What's love without tragedy?

You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh

[Verse 1: Drake]
Don't link me
Don't hit me when you hear this and tell me your favorite song
Don't tell me how you knew it would be like this all along
I know the truth is you won't love me until I'm gone
And even then the thing that comes after is movin' on
I can't even capture the feeling I had at first
Meetin' all my heroes like seein' how magic works
The people I look up to are goin' from bad to worse
Their actions out of character even when they rehearse
Workin' in the land of the free, the home of the brave
I gotta bring my brothers or else I feel out of place
Breakin' speed records on roads that these niggas paved
And they don't like that, it's written all on they face
I don't know how I'ma make it out of here clean
Can't even keep track of who plays for the other team
Iconic duos rip and split at the seams
Good-hearted people are takin' it to extremes
Leavin' me in limbo to question what I believe
Leavin' me to ask what's their motive in makin' peace
Leavin' me to not trust anybody I meet
Leavin' me to ask, is there anybody like me?

You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh, ayy

[Verse 2: Drake]
Missin' out on my years
There's times when I wish I was where I was
Back when I used to wish I was here
Missin' out on my days
Scrollin' through life and fishin' for praise
Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways
I try and see who's there on the other end of the shade
Most times it's just somebody that's underaged
That's probably just alone and afraid
And lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain
I always hear people complain about the place that they live
That all the people here are fake and they got nothin' to give
'Cause they been starin' at somebody else's version of shit
That makes another city seem more excitin' than it is
I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome
Then she finally got to Rome
And all she did was post pictures for people at home
'Cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known
I know another girl that's cryin' out for help
But her latest caption is ""Leave me alone""
I know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone
I know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown
To post later and make it look like she still on the go
Look at the way we live
I wasn't hidin' my kid from the world
I was hidin' the world from my kid
From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate
Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate
Breakin' news in my life, I don't run to the blogs
The only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call
They always ask, ""Why let the story run if it's false?""
You know a wise man once said nothin' at all
I'm exhausted and drained, I can't even pretend
All these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch
All these followers but who gon' follow me to the end?
I guess I'll make it to the end and I'ma find out then

405,Tenderness,"[Verse 1]
We’ve come to replace your clock’s old stubborn hands
We are the answer to why they never had a chance
It was not so long ago that the world was mostly slow
The age of iron, steam and speed
Turned a stroll to a stampede

[Pre-Chorus]
But we’ve come to increase time in between ticks
And there is romance in the slow dances
'Cause they’re fertile in hush, futile in haste
These are your nerves, this is how they taste

[Chorus]
Well I can’t count how many times I’ve been outdone by nihilism
Joined the march that splits an open heart into a schism
I cower at the thought of other people’s expectations
And yet still hand over mine to them

[Verse 2]
Travel where you are, tourism is sin
These are the ruins we left behind, you can’t take pictures of them
If what they say is true, then you become what you chew
If it decays spit it out, affectation is a drought

[Pre-Chorus]
That you wait through when you hate everything that you do
You wanna live outside the groove, then fine
But it’s there like a flower blooming in your ears
Open up your mouth, pollinate your peers

[Chorus]
Nothing reminds the mind of power like the cheap odor of plastic Leaking fumes we crave, consume, the rush it feels fantastic
But like power turns to mold, like a junkie going cold

Walking towards the airport, leaving us all in your past

Begged you to want me, but you didn’t want to

[Chorus]
But piece by piece, he collected me
Up off the ground, where you abandoned things, yeah
Piece by piece, he filled the holes that you burned in me
At six years old
And you know, he never walks away
He never asks for money
He takes care of me, he loves me
Piece by piece, he restored my faith
That a man can be kind and a father could stay

[Verse 2]
And all of your words fall flat
I made something of myself and now you wanna come back
But your love, it isn’t free, it has to be earned
Back then I didn’t have anything you needed, so I was worthless

But piece by piece, he collected me
Up off the ground, where you abandoned things, yeah
Piece by piece, he filled the holes that you burned in me
At six years old
And you know, he never walks away
He never asks for money
He takes care of me, 'cause he loves me

Piece by piece, I fell far from the tree
I will never leave her like you left me
And she will never have to wonder her worth
Because unlike you, I’m gonna put her first
And you know...
He’ll never walk away
He’ll never break her heart
He’ll take care of things, he’ll love her
Piece by piece, he restored my faith
That a man can be kind and a father should be great

408,Follow Your Heart,"[BOBBY, spoken]
Did you mean what you said? About everyone having a heart?

[HOPE, spoken]
Well, sure I did. Do you think you'd be feeling as bad as you do if you didn't have a heart?

[BOBBY, spoken]
I don't know. I suppose not. 

[HOPE, spoken]
Of course you wouldn't. Because then you'd be dead. 
(sung)
When darkness surrounds you and you lose your way
You have your own compass that turns night to day
And it's even with you before you depart
Be still, hear it beating
It's leading you
Follow your heart

[BOBBY, spoken]
Follow my heart. But to where?

[HOPE, spoken]
To wherever your heart tells you to go. 

[BOBBY, spoken]
Even there?

[HOPE, spoken]
Even to the clouds, if that's what your heart commands. What's it saying now?

[BOBBY, spoken]
I don't know. I don't know how to listen to my heart. 

[HOPE, spoken]
You have to listen carefully. Here, let me try. 

[BOBBY, spoken]
Do you -

[HOPE, spoken]
Shh! Ah, there it is. It's saying:
(sung)
We all want a world filled with peace and with joy
With plenty of water for each girl and boy
That bright, shining world is just waiting to start
No meanness or sorrow, just cleanness tomorrow
If only you follow your heart
(spoken)
You see there, Bobby? Even your heart knows you should follow your heart. 

[BOBBY, spoken]
Peace and joy? Plenty of water? I guess I do want those things. 

[HOPE, spoken]
There's something else your heart was saying. Maybe something I shouldn't have heard. 

[BOBBY, spoken]
There was?

[HOPE, spoken]
I think so. It was barely audible but I definitely heard something. 

[BOBBY, spoken]
Well? What was it?

[HOPE, spoken]
Let me try again, maybe I can make it out this time. There it is. So faint. It's saying:
(sung)
Follow, into the open air
Far from squalor and noise
Follow, someone is waiting there
Someone who shares all your hopes and your joys
(spoken)
Someone is waiting there? Why, my heart was saying those exact words just the other day. 

[BOBBY, spoken]
It-it was?

[HOPE, spoken]
Sure it was. Squalor and noise, hopes and joys. It was telling me about all those things. 

[BOBBY, spoken]
I didn't know two hearts could speak as one. 

[HOPE, spoken]
I didn't either, until now. Here, listen. 

[BOBBY]
Someday I'll meet someone whose heart joins with mine
Aortas and arteries all intertwined
They'll beat so much stronger than they could apart
Eight chambers of muscle to hustle the love in our heart

[BOBBY & HOPE]
Love is kind and considerate
Love is peaceful and fair
Love can creep up so suddenly
When you least think of it, your love is there

We all want a world filled with peace and with joy
With plenty of justice for each girl and boy
That bright shining world is just waiting to start
No anger or badness, just laughter and gladness
If only I follow your heart",Mark Hollmann,1985,"[88, 89]",2

It seems we lose the fight again
But there's just no stoppin' it
It's like a bad dream that never ends
It puts up walls between us

And harder and harder to remove
But we let it continue, like people in love always do
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Let's not pretend that we're unique
'Cause everybody's tasted loves illusion
We try to hide the fact that we
Got lost between the chaos and confusion
And the love we feel
Is gettin' deeper and deeper and deeper
And deeper, and deeper by the minute

But we let it slip away

I just knew too much

Only been at this for two years, thank God this shit happened so quick
Fashion me the latest, money comin' in but so do hatred
Shit ain't how I pictured, but I faced it

Should've peeped that fu' shit from the basis
This when the mistakes hit, tired of gettin' caught up in this fake shit
I just can't sit comfy with no snake shit

Everybody get it, if it's static, we don't spare shit
Really on my bully, 2020, we ain't playin'

Mama, she was prayin', I was on that block late
Really put in twenty years of work, but then I got weight
Sunday I ain't never go to church because that block pay
Big .40 cal' in my shirt, no karate
Fuck what the opps say, fuck what the cops say

I can never be a goofy nigga if they paid me
Songs too heat now, everything is wavy
Lot of niggas think it's competition, they amaze me
I was goin' downhill, jail kinda saved me
Gotta keep the hard work, ain't no gettin' lazy
Smokin' opposition kinda sorta got me dazy
Think you'd last a day up in my shoes, then nigga, trade me
Bitch, I need a billion in blues like I'm JAY-Z
Huh, R.I.P. to Mavy
Bitch, I'm cookin' now, got the sauce like it's gravy

Do's what you do, I do what I do

[Verse 1]
Getting down tonight if they say you cuttin'
A lot of dudes in my city, they ain't saying nothin'
A lot of records from here, they get no play
And these labels don't give advances so you get no pay
Them little rims on the ride, Imma let those stay
So these nosy niggas don't know that I get checks all day
'Whats he worth?' Fans keep trying to guess it
My record ain't even finish, they keep trying to press it
Boi-1da and Drake if it's beef I address it
And the black Phantom is here soon as Visalia exit
Both of the deals, nothin' under a mill
We know you got it to give and we trying to collect it
Long as I got me some heat through the winter
Drake known as a pro, I'ma teach you beginners
'Bout to ink with a major like sheets through a printer
For features, y'all better get me while it's cheaper than dinner
'Cause me and 1da trying to get at your girl
If you see her tell this nigga got some beats Imma send her

Check, the verses I'm writin', you might wanna learn it
You hatin' my song but your wife wanna burn it
So now you at the store for some blank CDs
You can't see me, for your sake, might wanna return it
'Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl
She'll forget you and I'll be the only one she concerned with
To the people that ignored me before this
This one is for you as a song re-recorded
Funny thing is, you just notice me now
But I was here along, your vision's just been distorted
I'm so throwed, wilin' in this, you ask me what the business is
And I'll write a sixteen and record it
The waiting is over I think music needed
Drake cuttin' his records without gettin' weeded
People in the South want it chopped and screwed
I got this dude they expectations I'ma exceed it
Like a single with only backgrounds
Y'all record and when it's done, ya lyrics tend to mislead shit
Finally here I'ma star with the timin'
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclinin'
This for anybody that's searchin' for cash
And purchasin' fast, you only get the dough when you grindin'
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne
My pain, you can experience through the rhymin', boy

Do's what you do, I do what I do

[Bridge]
Two years ago, a friend of mine
Asked me to kick some new school lines
And so I sent him a rhyme, it was fresh to death
Now not signing me is somethin' that the rest regret
Then I, hopped inside the Cadillac
The chauffeur drove off and we never came back

When I don't know what to say

Without knowing that life brings a change
And they've been checking all the signs
My friends say I'm love sick 'cause I
All I keep thinking about is her in my arms
(Got to see what love is all about)
And I won't be the same until she is mine
And my friends keep telling me to

[Hook]
Cool it now
You got to cool it now
Ooooooh watch out
You're gonna lose control
Cool it now
You got to slow it down
Slow it down
You're gonna fall in love

[Verse 2]
Every day I walk her home from school
And she tells me, how she really feels
And there's no doubt in my mind
That this girl is one of a kind
'Cause all I keep thinking about is her in my arms
(Understand you're one of a kind)
And I won't feel the same until she is mine
And my friends keep telling me to

And my friends keep telling me

[Rap: Michael Bivins & Ronnie DeVoe]
When you got a girl who takes her time
You must slow the pace, you can't mess with her mind
If she feels the same, she'll let ya know
Just prepare yourself or be ready to go
And I hope this message stays in your mind
'Cause you almost lost a girl who is right on time
There's one more thing that you got to know
Just cool it down and stay in control!

[Rap: Ralph]
Why you all coming down on me?
Trying to tell me how my life is supposed to be
I know you're only trying to help me out
Trying to show me what life is really about
But this time I'm gonna make it on my own
So why don't you fellas just leave me alone
Ronnie, Bobby, Ricky, and Mike
If I love the girl who cares who you like

427,Born In The USA,"[Verse 1]

Born in the U.S.A
I was born in the U.S.A

So they put a rifle in my hand
Sent me off to a foreign land
To go and kill the yellow man

Hiring man says, ""Son if it was up to me""
Went down to see my V.A. man
He said, ""Son, don't you understand""

[Verse 4]
I had a brother at Khe Sanh
Fighting off the Viet Cong
They're still there, he's all gone
He had a woman he loved in Saigon
I got a picture of him in her arms now

[Verse 5]
Down in the shadow of the penitentiary
Out by the gas fires of the refinery
I'm ten years burning down the road
Nowhere to run ain't got nowhere to go

[Chorus]
Born in the U.S.A
I was born in the U.S.A. now
Born in the U.S.A
I'm a long gone Daddy in the U.S.A. now

Wild boys, wild boys, wild boys
Wild boys
Wild! Boys!

[Verse 1]
The wild boys are calling
On their way back from the fire
In august moon's surrender to
A dust cloud on the rise
Wild boys fallen far from glory
Reckless and so hungered
On the razors edge you trail
Because there's murder by the roadside
In a sore afraid new world

[Pre-Chorus]
They tried to break us
Looks like they'll try again

[Chorus]
Wild boys never lose it
Wild boys never chose this way
Wild boys never close your eyes
Wild boys always shine

[Verse 2]
You got sirens for a welcome
There's bloodstain for your pain
And your telephone been ringing while
You're dancing in the rain
Wild boys wonder where is glory
Where is all you angels
Now the figureheads have fell
And lovers war with arrows over
Secrets they could tell

Pre-Chorus
They tried to tame you
Looks like they'll try again

[Chorus]
Wild boys never lose it
Wild boys never chose this way
Wild boys never close your eyes
Wild boys always shine

Wild boys, wild boys, wild boys
Wild boys, wild boys, wild boys

Wild boys never chose this way
Wild boys never close your eyes

Go for it, go for it
Tell her somethin' good
That ho, she go for it
Go for it, go for it
See me in the club
Shorty go for it
Go for it, go for it
Got waves in my fade
Need a surfboard
Go for it, go for it
Take fifty to the mall
Let you go for it

[Verse 1]
Swag jumped overboard
Call the coast guard
Yellow, black Ferrari
Pull up in my Landshark
Yeah, my homies got more tools than a BrandsMart
Have 'em knockin' on your door like your landlord
Question of the day: What car are you gonna drive today?
Money's not a problem, I'm booked up 'till the month of May
Million dollar man, call me Gucci Dibiase
Every week, come to the mall, rein'-up Versace
So if you hatin' on Gucci Mane, gon' and get in line
No matter what you drivin', don't park your car next to mine
And if you can't see all these diamonds, then you colorblind
Looked at my watch to check the time, it told me ""time to shine""

[Chorus]
Go for it, go for it
Tell her somethin' good
That ho, she go for it
Go for it, go for it
See me in the club

Go for it, go for it
Take fifty to the mall

[Verse 2]
I tell her somethin' slick, hope that she go for it
She wanna get with Gucci, and we both know it
Smoke so much kush that I need a 'dro card
Sell so much coke that I got a snow award
Hit the car lot like ""Fuck that shit, give me two of these""
Then, dropped the top late night to feel the summer breeze
I got her sellin' blow for me, no time
It's like I stuck my dick in a gold mine
Red bottom shoes, and they match the red Chevy
I'm the quarterback, I might just throw a Hail Mary
Gucci Mane, you know I pull a flea flicker
You industry, nigga
I'm in the streets, nigga

Go for it, go for it
Tell her somethin' good

My money startin' to stand like an ant pile
I'm all about my grands like a grandchild
Show my ass like I got my pants down
All my fans say that I'm the man, hands down
Diamonds dancin' on my hand, do the James Brown
Smokin' kush straight out the pound, I need to change towns
'Rari crawlin' down the street like a centipede
Ballin' like I'm in the league, but I'm not in the league
Got Jamaicans, and they cut that weed down by the tree
Fuck who it profit if that shit don't profit me

Everybody scatters and hopes it goes away
How many kids they've murdered only God can say, hey
If I had a rocket launcher, if I had a rocket launcher
If I had a rocket launcher, I'd make somebody pay

I don't believe in guarded borders and I don't believe in hate
I don't believe in generals or their stinking torture states
And when I talk with the survivors of things too sickening to relate
If I had a rocket launcher, if I had a rocket launcher
If I had a rocket launcher, I would retaliate

On the Rio Lacantun, one hundred thousand wait
To fall down from starvation, or some less humane fate
Cry for Guatemala, with a corpse in every gate
If I had a rocket launcher, if I had a rocket launcher
If I had a rocket launcher, I would not hesitate

I want to raise every voice, at least I've got to try
Every time I think about it water rises to my eyes
Situation desperate, echoes of the victims cry
If I had a rocket launcher, if I had a rocket launcher
If I had a rocket launcher, some son of a bitch would die",Bruce Cockburn,1985,"[98, 88, 89]",3

439,Valotte,"[Verse 1]
Sitting on the doorstep of the house I can't afford
I can feel you there
Thinking of a reason, well, it's really not very hard
To love you even though you nearly lost my heart
How can I explain the meaning of our love
It fits so tight, closer than a glove
Sitting on a pebble by the river playing guitar
Wond'ring if we're really ever gonna get that far
Do you know there's something wrong
'Cause I've felt it all along

[Verse 2]
I can see your face in the mirrors of my mind
Will you still be there?
We're really not so clever as we seem to think we are
We've always got our troubles so we solve them in the bar
As the days go by, we seem to drift apart
If I could only find a way to keep hold of your heart

[Chorus]
Sitting on a pebble by the river playing guitar
Wond'ring if we're really ever gonna get that far
Do you know there's something wrong
'Cause I've felt it all along

[Verse 3]
Sitting in the valley as I watch the sun go down
I can see you there
Thinking of a reason, well, it's really not very hard
To love you even though you nearly lost my heart
When will we know when the change is gonna come
I've got a good feeling and it's coming from the sun

[Chorus]
Sitting on a pebble by the river playing guitar
Wond'ring if we're really ever gonna get that far

440,Do They Know It's Christmas?,"[Paul Young]
It's Christmas time
There's no need to be afraid
At Christmas time
We let in light and we banish shade

And in our world of plenty
We can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world
At Christmas time

[George Michael]
But say a prayer
Pray for the other ones
At Christmas time it's hard

[Simon LeBon (Duran Duran)]
But when you're having fun
There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear

[Sting]
Where the only water flowing
Is the bitter sting of tears

[Bono & Sting]
And the Christmas bells that ring there
Are the clanging chimes of doom

[Bono]
Well tonight thank God it's them
Instead of you

[Boy George & Others]
And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life(Oooh)
Where nothing ever grows
No rain or rivers flow
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

Here's to you

Raise a glass for everyone

Here's to them

444,Knocking At Your Back Door,"Sweet Lucy was a dancer
But none of us would chance her
Because she was a Samurai
She made electric shadows
Beyond our fingertips
And none of us could reach that high
She came on like a teaser
I had to touch and please her
Enjoy a little paradise
The log was in my pocket
When Lucy met the Rockett
And she never knew the reason why

I can't deny it
With that smile on her face
It's not the kill
It's the thrill of the chase

Feel it coming
It's knocking at the door
You know it's no good running
It's not against the law
The point of no return
And now you know the score
And now you're learning
What's knockin' at your back door

Sweet Nancy was so fancy
To get into her pantry
Had to be the aristocracy
The members that she toyed with
At her city club
Were something in diplomacy
So we put her on the hit list
Of a common cunning linguist
A master of many tongues
And now she eases gently
From her Austin to her Bentley
Suddenly she feels so young

I can't deny it
With that smile on her face
It's not the kill
It's the thrill of the chase

Feel it coming
It's knocking at the door
You know it's no good running
No it's not against the law
The point of no return
And now you know the score
And now you're learning
What's knockin' at your back door

Sweet Lucy was a dancer
But none of us would chance her
Because she was a Samurai
She made electric shadows
Beyond our fingertips
And none of us could reach that high-high-high

I can't deny it
With that smile on her face
Oooo It's not the kill
It's the thrill of the chase

Feel it coming
It's knocking at your door
You know it's no good running
No it's knockin' at your door

446,I Can't Hold Back,"I don't know the time of the day
Lately, it all starts to look the same
Took a good look at myself
There was no one else to blame
Love is confusing, I hate the thought that I'm losing

And I can't hold back, 'cause you mean so much to me
I can't hold back, 'cause you give me what I need
I can't hold back, but I don't know where to start
I can't hold back, 'cause I feel it in my heart
I can't hold back, oh, no, no, I said I can't hold back, no no

Somewhere I've lost all my pride
Somewhere it's locked up inside
Everything went to my head
What's been done has been done
What's been said has been said
My heart is showing, yeah, now
Don't know if I'm comin' or goin'

And I can't hold back, 'cause you mean so much to me
I can't hold back, 'cause you give me what I need
I can't hold back, but I don't know where to start
I can't hold back now, 'cause I feel it in my heart
I can't hold back, no

Throw me a line, girl, pull me ashore
'Cause I'm sinkin' deeper everyday
We've got a love, girl, worth fightin' for
Don't let the past get in the way, yeah, yeah
And I can't hold back

Ooh, oh no

In your eyes there's a lovelight

Will that love light grow dim?

Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot

[Verse 1]
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as

'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God

Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody wants the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got

[Verse 2]
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!""—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy

I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!

Kneel before General Zod

So you'll be Thor, I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?!
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?",Eminem,1985,"[93, 74, 62, 31, 27, 29]",6
449,Lonely School,"I drove past where we used to live
You might have caught a glimpse of me
As I passed by

But at the time it seemed so clear to me
I thought I had it all worded out
I packed all that was dear to me
And I left without a doubt that I'd

Given it all I had to give
Still nothing moved nothing changed
Nothing lived
I did everything that I could do

But now I've had time to sort it out
To graduate from lonely school
And now I've got to let you know
It's me who was the fool

It was me baby I was wrong
But how can I say it
You must have known it all along
It was you who was always strong
And I've got to tell you now
I've got to show you how I've

Changed so many of my ways
I left the band, steadied my hand and learned a trade
And I'm coming back this time to stay

And you won't recognize the boy
Who graduated lonely school
'Cause I've become quite wise about
Who was or not the fool

And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends, there is no end

[Verse 2]
All through the night
Stray cat is crying so stray cat sings back
All through the night
They have forgotten what by day they lack
Oh under those white street lamps
There is a little chance they may see

[Chorus]
We have no past, we won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends, there is no end

[Bridge]
Oh the sleep in your eyes is enough
Let me be there let me stay there awhile

[Chorus]
We have no past, we won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends, there is no end
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends, there is no end",Cyndi Lauper,1985,"[96, 88, 78, 64, 33, 21]",6
451,No More Lonely Nights,"[Verse 1]
I can wait another day until I call you
Mm-hm
You've only got my heart on a string
And everything aflutter (na na na na)
But another lonely night might take forever (na na na na)

It's all the same to me love

What I feel

No more lonely nights
You're my guiding light
Day or night I'm always there

May I never miss the thrill
(Na-na-na na)
Of being near you

And if it takes a couple of years
To turn your tears to laughter

I will do
What I feel
To be right

[Chorus 2]
No more lonely nights, never be another
No more lonely nights

Mm mm mm
Doo doo doo da da da dum dum beh
Oh, eh, oh
Lost all of our woe
We lost all of our whoa-oh, sad love songs
Hey centipede, centipede, centipede, centipede, centipede...

[Chorus]
Oh, eh, oh
Lost all of our woe
We lost all of our whoa-oh, sad love songs
Hey centipede, centipede, centipede...

[Verse 1]
'Bino, will you be my baby daddy, yup
I'm too fresh, man, the world ain't never had me, yup
I'm too fresh, man, y'all ain't never gave me that
Stone Mountain, ain't no doubting, and these niggas won't hold me back
They wasn't hating him anyway
My roommate exercise, man, he moving that heavyweight
My girl ain't down to ride, couldn't deal with my day to day
I'm at my Grandma's house, man, like I don't know what to say
Maybe ""I'm sorry"" but sorry don't pay the rent
I promise to pay you back and I don't know where he at
But tell him he missing out, his grandson is cool as fuck
And tell me who be standing when them other ones giving up?
Let's keep it spontaneous, I don't need that rehearsal
More flow, man, than Progressive commercials
Get with the program, 'cause the plus loan ain't putting us on
I got month-long before I take the bus home

[Chorus]
Oh, eh, oh
Lost all of our woe
We lost all of our whoa-oh, sad love songs
Hey centipede, centipede, centipede...

[Verse 2]
I know this music shit ain't shit
And all these random niggas in my house make you anxious
And I ain't never told you that our love would be painless
But I was so in love with you I thought we could make it
Damn, I wasn't in it, damn, we wasn't finished
Damn, I got us tickets, damn, we went to Venice
Prioritize on our lives and made you into a business
That's why you wasn't surprised when I had made my decision
Gotta make it, 'cause if not I'm a failure, my wallet Azalea
And my brother still moving, ain't no shit I can tell him
Trying keep him out of trouble, but the cops is wilding
And it's nice to have a felon when the boys get violent
The Mexicans tried to jump me at the club
Funny thing was I thought they were stepping to show me love
Grandma's couch, my biggest fear, and fantasy
When I ain't in her arms all I'm making is enemies
Here I'm screaming obscenities at a nigga
Wanted to live bigger
Them Edenwald projects was eatin' our concept
Of anyone walking out, what is you talking about?
Gun Hill Road made them summers feel cold
On the same train that my parents met on
Twenty years later and my thoughts still ghetto
High off of pressure, man, that's a stiletto
Got your own couch now but you don't feel better

[Chorus]
Oh, eh, oh
Lost all of our woe
We lost all of our whoa-oh, sad love songs
Hey centipede, centipede, centipede...

453,I Just Called To Say I Love You,"[Verse 1]
No New Year's Day to celebrate
No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of Spring, no song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day
No April rain, no flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday, within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

[Chorus]
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

[Verse 2]
No summer's high
No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
No Libra sun
No Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

[Chorus]
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you

455,The Belle Of St. Mark,"The belle of St. Mark was a frail but a passionate creature
Ebony hair and eyes a deep blue-green
The belle of St. Mark wore clothes that belonged to his father
Even though he was only seventeen

I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love with the belle of St. Mark
It tears me apart whenever I hear him cry

I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love with the belle of St. Mark
And if he doesn't love me
I think I'll probably die

You can tell from expressions that he makes public
That he suffers from a badly broken heart
He smiles as he feeds the afternoon pigeons
But he cries as he walks the night streets of St. Mark

I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love with the belle of St. Mark
It tears me apart whenever I hear him cry

I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love with the belle of St. Mark
And if he doesn't love me
I think I'll probably die

The belle of St. Mark
He don't talk to strangers
He's so mysterious
His erotic persuasion provokes me like no other man
The fire I have for him is undoubtedly serious

I need to make him see that he needs love to forget
And if anyone can help him
I can
I can help
I can help you

His Paris hair
It blows in the warm Parisian air
That blows whenever his Paris hair is there
The woman that hurt him surely must have trouble sleeping
Cause the belle of St. Mark is a beauty extraordinaire

Oh, I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love with the belle of St. Mark
It tears me apart whenever I hear him cry

I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love with the belle of St. Mark
And if he doesn't love me
I think I'll probably die

Ooh, I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love with the belle of St. Mark
It tears me apart whenever I hear him cry

Ooh, I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love with the belle of St. Mark

And if he doesn't love me
I think I'll probably die
And if he doesn't love me

456,Hello Again,"Fast car and slicked back hair
Hundred miles going anywhere
I know I'm different that's what they say
I'd give it all just to feel the same

I was running now I'm drowning
What's my fuckin' name?
I've been dancing with the devil
As the music's played
But I can't hear the music till I see her face
Till I see her face

Hello again my dear
It's only been a year
And I wish you were here
Wish you were here

I know this can't be right
Running toward the dead of night
In my shoes I know what you'd say
Turn around and face the light of day

I was hiding from myself
What a fucking shame
And the devil left me stranded
When I called his name
Nothing hit me harder till I saw her face
Till I saw her face

Hello again my dear
It's only been a year
And I wish you were here
Wish you were here

Windows down now I can breathe
And make sense of everything
I can see the moment it went wrong
I'll rewind, replay and pause
I'll keep you there
Inside my arms

Hello again my dear
It's only been a year
And I wish you were here
Wish you were here

When I'm all alone it's you that I miss

That I could need someone, like I need you

Oh, what more can I do

Now there's one more thing I'd like to say
Don't you ever take your sweet love away
Girl I'll do anything, just please stay

[Bridge]
I don't understand it, oh what's come over me
But I'm not going to worry, no not anymore
Cause when a man's in love, he's only got one story
That's why my love is somewhere lost in your kiss
When I'm lost and alone it's you that I miss
With a love like yours, it's hard to resist

[Chorus]
Penny lover, don't you walk on by (don't you walk on by)
Penny lover, don't you make me cry (don't you make me cry baby)
Penny lover, don't you walk on by (don't you walk on by)
Penny lover, don't you make me cry (don't you make me cry baby)
Penny lover, don't you walk on by (don't you walk on by)

I remember the first time I saw you baby
Penny lover, don't you make me cry
You had the look in your eye, you had the look in your eye, yeah, yeah
Ooh pretty baby

I just want to reach out and hold you, I want to reach out and say ooh, ooh

I think it's all so right
That we don't need to fight
We stand face to face

Yes, I know you keep telling me that you love me
And I really do want to believe
But did you think I'd just accept you in blind faith?
Oh, sure, babe, anything to please you!

Woke up in a pool of sweat
Thought I heard a scream
Ran over to the window sill
Stuck my head out for a peek
Dressed in black was a man I didn't recognize
Running down my back street
My heart skipped a beat

[Chorus]
You better watch out
There's a stranger in town
You better watch out
There's a stranger in town
You better watch out
When he comes around
Don't make a sound

[Verse 2]
Got the morning paper and the headlines read:
Danger to the queen
Buckingham Palace better tighten things up
The son of a bitch is mean
Vendors on the corner just doin' their job
Acting like nothing's new
Scotland Yard's still looking for him
But he doesn't leave a single clue
What can they do?

[Chorus]
You better watch out
There's a stranger in town
You better watch out
There's a stranger in town
You better watch out
When he comes around
Don't make a sound

[Verse 3]
Who's this man who fell out of the sky?
What's he done and where's he live?
How can a man who's a criminal
Be a hero to the kids?
The old couple swear that the Ripper's back
They say it's him all right
The young girl says it's Jesus
And he won't be back again tonight
I wonder who's right

[Chorus]
You better watch out
There's a stranger in town
You better watch out
There's a stranger in town
You better watch out
When he comes around
You better watch out
There's a stranger in town
You better watch out
There's a stranger in town
You better watch out
When he comes around
Don't make a sound",Toto,1985,"[98, 94, 73, 58, 51]",5

I need a little loving company

Come on, baby, let's do it right

Give a little loving ecstasy
Come on now it's time to go

464,Big In Japan,"Last night, I partied a bit too hard
It's not quite coming back to me so far
I might not have slept, but I woke up a superstar
On another side of the world

And I don't mind

I'm out with my ladies, I see you eyeing me
You look fine as hell. Come over, and say hi to me
Oh, you got your boys with you? How about you bring them over?
Just be cool as shit whenever you are sober

Yeah, I'm out with my ladies. We are--having a ball
Oh, you want my phone number? Ok, give me a call
New dude, fitted cap, lets’ see what we can get into
Just walk it like you talk it. Yeah, I got my eye on you

Verse 1:
(Casey)

Whatcha’ staring at me like that for?
I just walked in. Your eyes are glued to the door
You like what you see, come over, and whisper it in my ear
I like confidence--bounce back with that fear
Now I'm shakin’ and grindin’ out on the dance floor
I can tell you want it, you starin’ at me some more
I can see over there, you are undressing me with your eyes
Boy, you better get it, ain't no time to be shy
Now, down that shot. Turn, wink at me
Now, get over here, and come grind with me
We’re getting it now, you got some dance move up your sleeve
You make me wanna stay forever, I don't wanna leave

Verse 2:
(Casey)

You slip me your number before you dip out that night
Said I’d hit you up, and see what kind of stuff you like
Don’t-get too excited, I’m just usually nice and friendly
I meet all kinds of people. Friends I have are plenty
But, if you talk it how I like it, then we can kick it
You are going to have to be patient. Give me a minute
I asked you if you smoked. You said, “Come by whenever.”
I was expecting yes or no, but your answer was way better
I pull a fast one, you smoke me out after the club
I chunked up my deuces, and stepped out like it was dub
We got out minds right. Our vibe was tight
But I blocked your hand whenever you went in for that dynamite!

Chorus:

I'm out with my ladies, I see you eyeing me
You look fine as hell. Come over, and say hi to me
Oh, you got your boys with you? How about you bring them over?

Verse 3:
(Casey)

All you gotta do is answer me the right way
You may be spitting game, but I will show you how it’s played
Don't be a lame, and make me have to bench ya
Keep it trill, know the deal, then maybe I might miss you
And if that happens, then I will holla at you to chill
You just gotta come with it. Take me out for a meal
Then call me randomly at 2:30 in the morning
If it is a good night for me, then it will definitely be on--And
Keep it full one-hundred. Make me feign for presence
Be a good boy. I will let you open up my presents
Don't even sweat it. I'll come through when I am ready
I don't like a rocky boat, I like my shit steady",Casey,1985,"[95, 74, 71, 75]",4
466,Walking On A Thin Line,"Sometimes in my bed at night
I curse the dark and I pray for light
And sometimes, the light's no consolation

Blinded by a memory
Afraid of what it might do to me
And the tears and the sweat
Only mock my desperation

Don't you know me
I'm the boy next door
The one you find so easy to ignore
Is that what I was fighting for?

Walking on a thin line
Straight off the front line
Labeled as freaks
Loose on the streets of the city

Walking on a thin line
Angry all the time
Take a look at my face
See what it's doing to me

Taught me how to shoot to kill
A specialist with a deadly skill
A skill I needed to have to be a survivor

It's over now or so they say
Well, sometimes, it don't work out that way
'Cause you're never the same
When you've been under fire, no

Don't you know me
I'm the boy next door
The one you find so easy to ignore
Is that what I was fighting for?

Walking on a thin line
Straight off the front line
Labeled as freaks
Loose on the streets of the city

Walking on a thin line
Angry all the time
Take a look at my face
See what it's done to me

Don't you know me
I'm the boy next door
The one you find so easy to ignore
Is that what I was fighting for, no

Walking on a thin line
Straight off the front line
Labeled as freaks
Loose on the streets of the city

Walking on a thin line
Angry all the time
Take a look at my face
See what it's doing to me

470,Ti Amo,"[Strofa 1]
Cerca di capire il mio stato mentale
Mi hanno tradito ogni volta che ero stato leale
Per me la donna cerca solo di fare un affare
Dice di amarti per chi sei ma ti vuole cambiare
E io non mi sono mai sentito abbastanza
So che loro vogliono certezze, in cerca uomini sicuri
Ero solo un ragazzino con una bocca scostumata
E una testa pieni di dubbi nascosta in occhiali scuri
E poi arrivi tu mentre combatto con la depressione
Dissi: ""Non so amare"", dissi: ""Fai attenzione""
Tu urlavi per nascondere il tuo bisogno d'amore
Capii che ti volevo perché sai cos'è il dolore
Iniziare come amici fino a sentirsi così sicuri
Dell'altro da sentirci liberi, ma liberi da che?
Siamo travolti dall'entusiasmo
Urliamo mentre scopiamo e moriamo in un orgasmo
Vorrei che fosse tutto come allora
Con tua mamma che diceva:""Sai, Luca ti adora""
Prima che controllassi i messaggi sopra i miei social
Prima che criticassi che faccio ogni mezz'ora
Ti presi e chiesi: ""Credi ancora alla magia?""
Allora perché fai del male a chi dici di amare?
Perché colpisci nell'orgoglio per farmi affondare?
E io confuso
Mi stavo dimenticando che ti stavi innamorando
E poi se i soldi non sono un problema
Allora perché essere contenti ci costa così tanto?
Mi regalasti un libro, nella dedica il nostro futuro
Ti chiesi: ""A cosa pensi?"" e tu: ""Al nostro matrimonio""
Tutti in bianco sulla spiaggia e dire ""Sì"" al tramonto
Eppure scrissi a quella troia e non mi resi conto
Ti lasciai fuori casa evitando un confronto
Se ti fosse successo qualcosa, adesso sarei morto

[Ritornello]
Ti è capitato mai di riuscire a dire di no
Io faccio solo guai e non sono lucido da un po'
E lo so, ma se sono qui è perché ti amo
Ti è capitato mai di riuscire a dire di no
Io faccio solo guai e non sono lucido da un po'
E lo so, ma se sono qui è perché ti amo

[Strofa 2]
Dimostrami quello che provi
Continua a cercare quello che non trovi
Ch'io ho paura che ti ho perso e voglio che riprovi
A rivivere i ricordi prima che li rimuovi
Tu non sai che più aggressiva sei e più mi spingi via
Provo a essere dolce ma che vuoi che sia
Il tuo viso impresso come una fotografia
Lo porterò sul palco come una scenografia
E vado via per settimane perché vivo nel mio mondo
Con tutte le cose inutili che ancora ti nascondo
Tu sola in casa mentre io in giro da vagabondo
A spendere quello che ho guadagnato in un secondo
La vita da single mi ha fottuto
Mi giravo quando mi parlavi di futuro
Mi stringevi forte quando abbandonavo tutto
Vederti sanguinare quella notte mi ha distrutto
E se solo fossimo andati a vivere insieme
Svegliarsi la notte per darti da bere se hai sete
Non mi sentivo pronto a fare tabula rasa
Due caratteri di fuoco incendierebbero la casa
Ma c'è un motivo per cui amo e non si spiega
Lo si legge nelle urla
Lo si legge nei miei pianti, nei rimpianti
Quando manchi, quando mi soffermo sui dettagli
Vorrei che tu davvero veda al di là dei miei sbagli
E quando distrussi casa volevo dire ""Credimi""
Quando sparii per giorni volevo dire ""Cercami""
Mi consumi come una candela
Ma sei la fiamma che mi rende vivo a malapena
E siamo stanchi di essere svegli di notte
Vorremmo iniziare da capo
Senza un passato che ci ha segnato
E ti scagli contro me senza mai un perché
Io non riconosco più chi sei e tu non riconosci me

[Ritornello]
Ti è capitato mai di riuscire a dire di no
Io faccio solo guai e non sono lucido da un po'

473,Friends/Five Minutes Of Funk,"Whodini, launchin' rockets in the 90s!

Now I remember in the days of way back
With just a 4-track
With no SP-12 to make tracks
Wearing leather suits and boots was the gear
Of fly bands and hip hop stars of the year
""Hey-ho"" when rockin' on the street was the show
When the people clapped but they went home with no dough
Sportin' All Star walking to the beat of the Funky Four + 1
And the awesome Treacherous Three
Bump it in your Walkman, the music was explodin'
But these are The Breaks from the king Kurtis Blow
And giving us The Message is Grandmaster Flash, The Fearless Four
But still they said that rap won't last
Radio was playin' it, street kids were sayin' it
Soulsonic Force had the funk and they were bringing it
Then we threw the Whodini sound in the crew
With Magic Wand, had it going on (Old school)
Bringing the freaks out at night, Rapper's Delight
Fly girls were giving hip hop a new light
Pioneers who've given rap its life and itself
All praise due and remember that time repeats itself

Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
(You know we got a...) reputation
Let's do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
(You know we got a...) reputation
Now check it out

I remember in the days when we wore gold chains
And leisure suits, Adidas and Pumas with no strings
And boppin' to The Rap Attack
Run-DMC was hittin' everywhere with Rock Box
The inner-city was complimentin' Big Mouth
One Love, and Friends
The Five Minutes of Funk, those days will never end
The Dynamix would break and all over town
All over the world, hip hop came and made its rounds
Taking up the fresh cuts, 1, 2, and 3
That was Whodini and Run-DMC
Lookin' at the kids with boomboxes on their shoulders
Sheepskins, Gazelles, leather bombers lookin' bolder
Then LL and Rakim came to life
One for makin' us dance, the other insight
The fans was getting bigger, look what we delivered
You still think that rap is gonna die, how do you figure?
Every time you say it's gonna pass
Hip-hop comes out with another style of rap and slaps your ass
Boogie Down Production, Biz and Public Enemy
DJs The Red Alert and Magic gave us energy
Tour and tour and show after show
And everybody freaked when Marley Marl had control
And pioneers who've given rap its life and itself
All praise due, remember that time repeats itself

Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
(You know we got a...) reputation
Let's do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
(You know we got a...) reputation

Do it, do it, do it

Do it, do it, do it

I'm thinkin' of today's sound and how it all changed
To hear it on the radio, no longer in the game
Videos just get me depressed
Well I guess a 9 to 5 isn't a way to end my quest
I see mad MCs with fat raps and [?]
Thinkin' if Whodini could ever compete with that
Little kids rockin' on the mic [?]
Whatever happened to the nameplates of funky fresh era?
Then I see Run-DMC comin' back
Old school MCs become the new school styles of rap
Like Naughty by Nature, Leaders of the New
A Tribe Called Quest, Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy too
Red Alert keepin' it street for the core
Of hard rocks, respect to you Red and many more
Awesome Two paved the way thru and thru
Thanks to all the DJs keeping it real and true
We used to be on the outside lookin' in
Now Whodini is comin' back to do it all again
Pioneers who've given rap its life and itself
All praise due and notice that time repeated itself!

474,Hard Habit To Break,"I guess I thought you'd be here forever
Another illusion I chose to create
You don't know what you got until it's gone
And I found out a little too late
I was acting as if you were lucky to have me
Doin' you a favor, I hardly knew you were there
But then you were gone, and it all was wrong
Had no idea how much I cared

Now being without you takes a lot of getting used to
Should learn to live with it but I don't want to
Being without you is all a big mistake
Instead of getting easier, it's the hardest thing to take
I'm addicted to you babe, you're a hard habit to break

You found someone else you had every reason
You know I can't blame you for runnin' to him
Two people together but livin' alone
I was spreading my love too thin
After all of these years I'm still tryin' to shake it
Doin' much better, they say that it just takes time
But deep in the night, it's an endless fight
I can't get you out of my mind

Now being without you takes a lot of getting used to
Should learn to live with it but I don't want to
Being without you is all a big mistake
Instead of getting easier, it's the hardest thing to take
I'm addicted to you babe, you're a hard habit to break

Can't go on, just can't go on, on, can't go on
Just can't go on, on
Now being without you takes a lot of getting used to
Should learn to live with it but I don't want to
Being without you is all a big mistake
Instead of getting easier, it's the hardest thing to take
I'm addicted to you babe, you're a hard habit to break

Such a hard habit to break I'm addicted to you

475,Had A Dream (Sleeping With The Enemy),"[Verse 1]
Had a dream, I was born to be naked in the eye of the storm
And now it's standing right in front of me
What's it going to do to me, who knows
Had a dream, it was time to be taken to the front of the line
Well that is not a place you wanna be
Sleeping with the enemy, you know

[Chorus]
I don't care what the future brings, give a damn about anything
I'd be fine if they'd only leave me alone
But it's time, gotta take a stance 'cause I won't get a second chance
And I know now I have to make it alone

[Verse 2]
Had a dream it was war, and they couldn't tell me what it was for
But it was something they could lie about, something we could die about, you know
Anytime, anyplace when you look that man in the face
Well it is not a face you wanna see
Sleeping with the enemy, you know

[Bridge]
Mary, can you hear me, can you tell me what it's all supposed to mean
Holding out a photograph of all that I have seen
I wish I could hold you, I wish I could hold you

[Verse 3]
Had a dream, it was time to be a witness at the scene of the crime
Well that is something you can analyze, something you can criticize, who knows
So we wait, hesitate and we're making such a mistake
Oh whatever can the matter be, sleeping with the enemy you know

[Chorus]
I don't care what the future brings, give a damn about anything
I'd be fine if they'd only leave me alone
But it's time, gotta take a stance 'cause I won't get a second chance
And I know now I have to make it alone",Roger Hodgson,1985,"[95, 86, 84]",3

Livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere

A singer in a smoky room
The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile, they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waitin'
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night
Streetlight people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice just one more time
Some will win, some will lose
Some are born to sing the blues

Beware the danger it lurks for those who get swept away
The dreamers get punished most by the truth they say
It's all in the little ways one reveals their
Love's gone away, love's gone away

[Verse 2]
When my hand was in you hand, my heart was pure
And now I see a different man, rewriting memories
The dogs run down the beach and all I'm left with is
Sand in my shoes, sand in my shoes

Cause fools like me
Oh, we love blindly
And the cracks don't count
It's gotta break in front of me

Now I recall that time at the cafe
The thunderstorm outside, words you could never say
They hold the loudest tones, you say you'll write
But it's ink on a page, just ink on a page

With fools like me
Oh, we love blindly
And the cracks don't count
It's gotta break in front of me

I always knew the truth

I think that we're making a big mistake

Are we just together for convenience sake, baby

It's just a stage we're going through (they say clean cuts)
I think you're just restless for something new (heal much faster)

Baby, feeling like we pay our dime
And all we get in return
Is a piece of each other's time

Are we just Taxi Dancing
Lost somewhere in a slow dance for two
And the band that was playing
Has finally stopped playing our favorite song

Are we just Taxi Dancing
You're paying for me and I'm paying for you
And are we holding on to a feeling with desperation

Don't know if you're right
Don't know if you're wrong
Seems to me we haven't danced for long

Don't make it hard (I won't)
Don't make it easy (hold you)
We'll just walk away (if you)
At the end of the song (must go)

Baby, put one last nickel in the jukebox
Give that love we once felt
Just one final spin around

'Cause we're just Taxi Dancing
Lost somewhere in a slow dance for two

Has finally stopped playing our favorite song

I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted
And even though your friends tell me you're doing fine
Are you somewhere feeling lonely even though he’s right beside you?
When he says those words that hurt you
Do you read the ones I wrote you?

[Pre-Chorus: Calum]
Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all

[Chorus: All & Luke]
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all

[Verse 2: Calum]
The pictures that you sent me, they're still living in my phone
I admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone
And all my friends keep asking why I'm not around
It hurts to know you’re happy and it hurts that you moved on
It’s hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long

[Pre-Chorus: Calum]
It’s like we never happened, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?

And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

[Bridge: Luke]
If today I woke up with you right beside me
Like all of this was just some twisted dream
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
And you'd never slip away
And you'd never hear me say

I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them

You're so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer

You fit me better than my favorite sweater
And I know that love is mean (Oh-oh) and love hurts (Oh-oh)
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh baby

I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years

Love you more than those bitches before

Big dreams, gangsta
Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like, ""No, please, stay here
We don't need no money, we could make it all work""
But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday
I stayed up waiting, anticipating and pacing
But he was chasing (Oh-oh) paper (Oh-oh)
Caught up in the game, that was the last I heard

You went out every night, and baby, that's alright
I told you that no matter what you did, I'd be by your side
'Cause I'ma ride or die, whether you fail or fly
Well, shit, at least you tried
But when you walked out that door, a piece of me died
Told you I wanted more; that's not what I had in mind
I just want it like before, we were dancing all night
Then they took you away, stole you out of my life
You just need to remember

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim & Trife]
Uh! Do you know who I be?
Lil' Kim the Lieutenant (that's right)
Here to put it on you fools tryin' to run up in it
(What's the matter Big Momma, don't you like what you see?)
Like my girl Mary B. you just ain't runnin' up in me, uh
You got to give me what I need baby..
That's a drop top Z baby
Martini & Rossi, Asti Spumante
Dom Perignon so we can get it on
Movado watch, Tennis for the wrists
Nigga; you ain't ever seen no ice like this
So now you know what you workin' with, handle your business
And keep coming with that stuff that I like (like..)
Light a candle, I'm too hot to handle
I see yo' eyes sizin' up my hips and my thighs
Man I'll do things to you (uh-huh)..
Vanessa del Rio be 'shamed to do

[Chorus: Aaliyah]
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love baby?
Because I need you tonight
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love baby?
Because I need you tonight

[Verse 3: Kleptomaniac]
Mack ass nigga, smooth like Tom Cat in the zoot-suit
Game's fullproof leavin' parties with bitches in NSX Coupes
Spittin' game, with or without the eye contact
With or without contracts, layin' my game down flat
Kleptomaniac, rides any rhythm that you give him, I'm livin' right
Semi-precious stones, exotic bitches in skin-tights
Hands-free mobile phone, showin' women how to live life
If that's your girl, she wasn't last night
Made her life worthwhile, Benjamins by the piles
Turn her frowns to smiles, livin' Goodfellas lifestyles
Nails done and hair, livin' rooms with chandeliers
Sex in a strech Lex, no cares for who wanna stare
Yeah, now that's a real women for ya
High execs and lawyers, pearls gems and Tag Heuers
Bachelor degrees, bringin' home bacon and cheese
Freaky Saundra ain't afraid to get some dirt up on her knees

[Chorus: Aaliyah]
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love baby?
Because I need you tonight
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love baby?
Because I need you tonight
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love baby?
Because I need you tonight
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love baby?
Because I need you tonight
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love baby?
Because I need you tonight
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love baby?
Because I need you tonight",Junior M.A.F.I.A.,1985,[100],1
