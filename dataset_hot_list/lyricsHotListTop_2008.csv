[Intro]
All the single ladies (All the single ladies)
All the single ladies (All the single ladies)
All the single ladies (All the single ladies)
All the single ladies
Now put your hands up

[Verse 1]
Up in the club (club), just broke up (up)
I’m doing my own little thing
Decided to dip (dip), but now you wanna trip (trip)
'Cause another brother noticed me
I’m up on him (him), he up on me (me)
Don’t pay him any attention
Cried my tears (tears), for three good years (years)
You can’t be mad at me

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don’t be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don’t be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it

[Verse 2]
I got gloss on my lips (lips), a man on my hips (hips)
Hold me tighter than my Deréon jeans
Acting up (up), drink in my cup (cup)
I can't care less what you think
I need no permission, did I mention?
Don’t pay him any attention
'Cause you had your turn (turn)
But now you gon' learn
What it really feels like to miss me

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don’t be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don’t be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
Don't treat me to the things of the world
I’m not that kind of girl
Your love is what I prefer, what I deserve
Here’s a man that makes me, then takes me
And delivers me to a destiny, to infinity and beyond
Pull me into your arms
Say I’m the one you want
If you don’t, you’ll be alone
And like a ghost, I’ll be gone

[Bridge]
All the single ladies (All the single ladies)
All the single ladies (All the single ladies)
All the single ladies (All the single ladies)

Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don’t be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
'Cause if you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don’t be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it

[Intro: T.I.]
Ay... this a special what's happenin' to all my
All my soldiers over there in Iraq
E'rybody right here
What you need to do is be thankful for the life you got, y'knowmsayin?
Stop lookin' at what you ain't got
Start bein' thankful for what you do got
Let's give it to 'em baby girl, hey

[Chorus: Rihanna]
You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
So live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
You steady chasin' that paper

My life (AYY) my life (OHH) just livin' my life

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Hey, never mind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin' days away now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege, homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious, they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still, I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay' you know they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray, now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away

[Chorus: Rihanna]
You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy car-ars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
So live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
[You steady chasin' that paper]
Just live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
No tellin' where it'll take ya
Just live your life (OHH! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
Cause I'm a paper chaser
Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH)
Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH) just livin' my life

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
Articulate, but still I'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin' problems with their record sales just holler Tip
If that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow Tip
I got love for the game, but ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame, and rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

[Chorus: Rihanna]
You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
So live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
No tellin' where it'll take ya
Just live your life (OHH! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
Cause I'm a paper chaser
Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH)
Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH) just livin' my life

[Bridge: Rihanna]
Got everybody watchin' what I do, come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money
And I'm not goin' awayyyyyyy
So keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
Look in the mirror, and keep on shinin' (shinin')
Until the game ends, 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot
Livin' the life, the life
In the Windmill City got my whole team with me
The life, my life
I do it how I wanna do
I'm livin' my life, my life
I will never lose
I'm livin' my life, my life
And I'll never stop it

I try to always do right
I thought I lost you this time

I don't do well when alone (Oh yeah)
You hear it clear in my tone

'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless

8,If I Were A Boy,"[Verse 1]
If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

[Chorus 1]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

[Verse 2]
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I'd know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home

[Chorus 1]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (Wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (Granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

[Bridge]
It's a little too late for you to come back
Say, it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

[Chorus 2]
But you're just a boy
You don't understand
(Yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday, you'll wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed

9,Love Lockdown,"[Produced by Kanye West & Jeff Bhasker]

[Verse 1]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So you never know, never never know
Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, system overload
Screaming, ""No, no, no, n-nooo!""
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

[Chorus]
So keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—you lose

[Verse 2]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you 'fore it finally got through?
You lose, you lose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life
We're just racing time, where's the finish line?

[Chorus]
So keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—you lose

[Verse 3]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I bet no one knew, I got no one new
Know I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it going, keep the loving going
Keep it on the roll, only God knows
If I be with you, baby I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
Where I wanna go, I don't need you
I've been down this road, too many times before
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to

[Chorus]
So keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—you lose

10,Love Story,"[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""hello""
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus 1]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go and I said

[Chorus 2]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said

Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring

[Chorus 3]
And said: ""Marry me Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby just say 'yes'""

11,I'm Yours,"[Verse 1]
Well, you done done me, and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
And now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn
To win some or learn some

[Chorus]
But I won't hesitate no more
No more it cannot wait, I'm yours
Hmm (Hey, hey)

[Verse 2]
Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free
And look into your heart, and you'll find love, love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, love, love, love, loved

[Chorus]
So I won't hesitate no more
No more it cannot wait, I'm sure

[Post-Chorus]
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours
A-do you, do, do, do you, but do you, do you, do, do, but do you want to come on?
Scooch on over closer, dear
And I will nibble your ear
A-soo da ba ba ba ba bum
Whoa, oh oh oh
Whoa, oh oh oh oh whoa whoa whoa
Uh-huh, hmm

[Verse 3]
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I've been saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

[Chorus]
But I won't hesitate no more
No more it cannot wait, I'm yours

[Verse 4]
Well, open up your mind and see like me (I won't hesitate)
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free (No more, no more)
And look into your heart, and you'll find that (It cannot wait)
The sky is yours (I'm sure there's no)
So please don't, please don't, please don't (No need, oh, now now)
There's no need to complicate (For the reggae, our time)
'Cause our time is short (Is short, this)
This oh, this oh, this is our fate (Is our fate)
I'm yours, ha!

12,Let It Rock,"[Verse 1: Kevin Rudolf]
I see your dirty face, hide behind your collar
What is done in vain, truth is hard to swallow
So you pray to God to justify the way
You live a lie, live a lie, live a lie
And you take your time
And you do your crime
Well, you made your bed
I made mine

Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What this is, forgot, I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

[Verse 2: Kevin Rudolf]
Now the son's disgraced, he who knew his father
When he cursed his name, turned and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart, so he stuck his middle finger
To the world, to the world, to the world
And you take your time
And you stand in line
Well, you'll get what's yours
I got mine

Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What this is, forgot, I must now remind you

And Tamara, ménage à moi
I'm in here like, ""Bitch, what's up?""
Mechanic, me, I can fix you up
I can dick you up, I can dick you down
Shorty, we can go wherever, just pick a town
And my jewelry is louder than an engine sound
Big-ass rocks like on the ground
Dirty like socks that's on the ground
Weezy

Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What this is, forgot, I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Because when I arrive, I, I'll bring the fire

To find the one in this life

The moment when we're meeting
Will play out like a scene
Straight off the silver screen
So I'll be holding my breath
Right up 'til the end

I find the one that I'll spend forever with

There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere (The same somewhere)
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

19,Chicken Fried,"[Intro]
You know I like my chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

[Verse 1]
Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia Pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea, pecan pie, and homemade wine where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground

[Chorus]
And a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

[Verse 2]
It's funny how it's the little things in life that mean the most
Not where you live, what you drive, or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a piece of mind
This I've come to know
So if you agree, have a drink with me
Raise your glasses for a toast

[Chorus]
To a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
I thank God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly, let it ring
Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives so we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love

[Chorus]
Like our chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

Get your little chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've done seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love",Zac Brown Band,2008,"[20, 22, 23, 20, 22, 23, 28, 31, 36, 47, 52, 52, 60]",13

Hiking up your skirts, climbing up your shirts
It's Mr. Late Night Luda, and I like to flirt
So guess what, baby girl!

Yeah, yeah
If I take one more drink (Drink)

27,Better In Time,"[Intro] I don't know why I be fucking witchu

[Verse One: 2Pac]
Was it the liquor, that makes me act blind, times that I'm with her
Anonymous pictures of other niggas tryin to kiss her
Will I love her or shall I diss her?
I'm sick of this scandalous shit I deal wit
Tryin to paint a perfect picture
My memories of jealousy no longer carefree
Cause so much bullshit your girlfriends keep tellin me
I'm on tour, but now my bedroom's an open door
So it got me thinkin, what am I tryin for?
When I was young I was so very dumb, eager to please
A lil', trick on a mission tryin to get in my P's
Me and my niggas is thug niggas, former known drug dealers
We don't love bitches and believe, they don't love niggas
I gotta blame my attraction
But you became a distraction, a threat to my paper stackin
I thought you changed but now I know
Can't turn a ho into a housewife, baby, and there you go

[Hook: Jazze Pha]
Baby there you go, actin like a ho
There you there you go, actin like a ho
Baby there you go, actin like a ho
Actin like a ho, actin like a ho
HOE! See the word on the streets you're a
HOE! Just a groupie on a world tour
HOE! Now I found out for myself you're a
HOE! Girl you need to check yourself

[Verse Two: Kastro]
These silly bitches got this game twisted
So I don't claim 'em, just bang 'em
Papa raised a player, so player, I play 'em
I got hoes that got more, hoes than me
So how I look, gettin hooked, like I ain't got G?
Truly cutie booty big, but that ain't enough
And the head make me beg, still that just ain't enough
When I don't trust her, the bitch be lyin too much
When she be dyin to fuck me you be buyin her stuff, ho

[Verse Three: Kadafi]
See girlfriend I know, your whole M.O.'s preoccupied with mostly
Gettin clown after clown, town coast to coast - see
I been tryin to stay away from sluts like you
Got me turned off completely by that sheisty shit that you do
Knew from jump yo' aim, straight through them spandex, don't front
Just name, spots on yo' body for me to touch while you clutch this game
I keep flowin like H20 it ain't nuthin for me to say
Why you keep actin like a ho? But there you go

28,Beautiful,"[Intro]
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
Then I'm reaching out for you

[Verse 1]
I'm just so fuckin' depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need somethin' to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when
I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent
But I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
I need a new outlet
And I know some shit's so hard to swallow
But I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact:
I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles—

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Verse 2]
I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything's so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature
Of the room, just as soon as
I walk in, it's like all eyes on me
So I try to avoid any eye contact
‘Cause if I do that, then it opens a door
For conversation like I want that
I'm not lookin' for extra attention
I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant
Tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny, like, ""Ha!
Marshall, you're so funny, man
You should be a comedian, goddamn!""
Unfortunately I am
I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down?
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles—

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Verse 3]
Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now, I could've either just sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid
Aunt Edna always told me:
""Keep making that face, it'll get stuck like that.""
Meanwhile, I'm just standin' there
Holdin' my tongue, tryin' to talk like this
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then
‘Cause I wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no mo'
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
‘Cause where you see it from where you're sittin'
It's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each other's shoes at least
What size you wear? I wear 10's
Let's see if you can fit your feet—

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Bridge]
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
Then I'm reaching out for you

[Outro]
Yeah, to my babies: stay strong
Daddy'll be home soon
And to the rest of the world: God gave you them shoes to fit you
So put 'em on and wear 'em, be yourself, man
Be proud of who you are, even if it sounds corny
Never let no one tell you you ain't beautiful",Eminem,2008,"[29, 19]",2
29,You Found Me,"[Verse 1]
I found God on the corner of First and Amistad
Where the west was all but won
All alone smoking his last cigarette
I said, ""Where you been?"" He said, ""Ask anything""

[Verse 2]
Where were you when everything was falling apart?
All my days were spent by a telephone
That never rang and all I needed was a call
That never came to the corner of First and Amistad

[Chorus]
Lost and insecure, you found me, you found me
Lying on the floor, surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?, Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

[Verse 3]
In the end, everyone ends up alone
Losing her, the only one who's ever known
Who I am, who I'm not, and who I wanna be
No way to know how long she will be next to me

[Chorus]
Lost and insecure, you found me, you found me
Lying on the floor, surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?, Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

[Bridge]
Early morning the city breaks and I've been calling for years and years and years and years
And you never left me no messages, you never send me no letters
You got some kind of nerve taking all I want

[Pre-Chorus]
Lost and insecure, you found me, you found me
Lying on the floor, where were you, where were you?

[Chorus]
Lost and insecure, you found me, you found me

Doing 90 in a 65

Hey-ey-ey... I'm so paid
Number one hustla get money
Why you wanna count a nigga money?
I'm a hustla and I don't need them!
One of them ya'll see! I'm so paid

[Verse 1: Akon]
I see police on the crooked I
Doing a 100 on the Interstate 95
My shawty leanin', blasting that Do or Die
Wishing that motherfuckin' would, ‘cause we're certified
Got a system that'll beat and knock your wall off
Got a pump under my seat, the sawed-off
Got a bunch of goons, hoping they never call off
And them snipers sitting on the roof already saw y'all
It ain't too much to put a strain on me
That's the reason why I had to put the blame on me
I rather have them dollar bills rain on me
Than let them haters come and make the name off me
That's why

[Verse 2: Young Jezzy]
She said, ""Young, why your voice so hoarse?""
I just sound like money, baby, I should've been a Porsche (vroom)
Paint look like a sugar free Red Bull
I'm so paid, you know I keep a pocket full
And that's before the taxes
Took my own gross net and hid it under my mattress
Used to get bored and count 20's for practice
Paper therapy we let money relax us
Gold chains around my neck just like Michael Phelps
I made a killing in the water, kill them in the water
Against all odds and I will not stop
They try and keep me on bottom, but I prefer the top
And my project chick, I moved her next to Joc
She said the house too small, I moved an extra block
So, baby, get your ass up, I need an extra block
I told her do the speed limit and no extra stops; and that's why

[Chorus: Akon]
I get it in 'til sunrise

I am the boss it only takes one call
For a driver to hit you up and drop you off, that's all
Guess what? I won't be taking that fall
Homie, I got cake, that's what I'm paying them for
Ha ha, ain't that funny?
‘Cause niggas want war but ain't got money
‘Cause I've seen them all talking 'til they start gunning
Quicker than Usain Bolt, the fastest thing running
Yeah! Akon! Weezy!
Black Royals holdin' down Jersey
Devine making sure we getting it up front
My little brother Bu got that vision, baby

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Ahem, Big Money Weezy
White wife beater with the Sig underneath it
How do I feel? Bitch, I feel undefeated
Snap my fingers, disappear from the precinct
Yeah, I'm ballin', we ball out
Ball 'til we fall until the ball bounce
I send some niggas with guns at y'all house
Only to find out you live in a doll house
Damn, but I thought you was tough, though
We carry choppers on our necks; call it cut throat
We bury cowards on the set that they come from
We know magic, turn weed smoke to gun smoke
We bomb first when we ride
You in a hearse when you ride
I put my shoe down, baby
And I'm holding down Young Moolah, baby! That's why

31,Viva La Vida,"[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old King is dead, long live the King
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield

Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

Look at me now
Tears of sorrow
This love remains the same
As a mirror without image

Catch my own breath
Don't wanna be a man who cries
Stop now!
Memories, suffering, look at me now
Is this the man you knew?
Certainties break down

This love remains the same

These words it cannot change
As a mirror without a name... Break!

Somebody wants to be a fighter
Somebody can cry
I just wanna find myself

This love remains the same
As a mirror without image
These words it cannot change

Your love can leave me blind, it's so sweet
When it takes me high but I feel guilty now... yeah

I bust the windows out your car
And, no, it didn't mend my broken heart
I'll probably always have these ugly scars
But right now, I don't care about that part
I bust the windows out your car
After I saw you laying next to her
I didn't wanna, but I took my turn
I'm glad I did it cause you had to learn

[Chorus]
I must admit it helped a little bit
To think of how you'd feel when you saw it
I didn't know that I had that much strength
But I'm glad you see what happens when
You see you can't just play with people's feelings
Tell them you love them and don't mean it
You'll probably say that it was juvenile
But I think that I deserve to smile

[Verse 2]
I bust the windows out your car
You know I did it cause I left my mark
Wrote my initials with a crowbar
And then I drove off into the dark
I bust the windows out your car
You should feel lucky that was all I did
After 5 whole years of this bullshit
Gave you all of me and you played with it

[Chorus]
I must admit it helped a little bit
To think of how you'd feel when you saw it
I didn't know that I had that much strength

You see you can't just play with people's feelings
Tell them you love them and don't mean it
You probably say that it was juvenile
But I think that I deserve to smile

I bust the windows out your car
But it don't compare to my broken heart
You could never feel how I felt that day
Until it happens, baby, you don't know pain
Oh, yeah, I did it. You should know it
I ain't sorry. You deserved it
After what you did to me
You deserved it. I ain't sorry no, no
You broke my heart, so I broke your car
You caused me pain, so I did the same
Even though what you did to me was much worse
I had to do something to make you hurt

Why am I the one who's still crying?

Uh, I'd take a shot for you and everything we did
And everything we once was in our relationship
Everything was straight when we first started dating
Thought I'd never see the day when it's both our hearts breaking
So I'm drinking every weekend, speaking sober thoughts
Staring at my phone, wondering if I should call
Tell you how I feel, cause the pain still hasn't healed
Everything feels out of place, I think a part of me was killed
When I let you go, thinking we could take it slow
But one weeks past, already found another man to hold
I should have known, I mean you're in college right
You probably met someone at some fucking party right
I seen it coming, but chose to ignore it
In hopes that we could find each others love and then restore it
But you went out exploring, scoring like it’s a game
And I'm just sitting back like why the fuck do things change
Cause things change and there ain't shit that you can do about it
But take blame for all the bullshit that you provided
I can't deny it, I've made my mistakes
But I was trying to fix em' and now it's too late

[Verse 2: Jaytekz]
Uh, so I guess this is it, my final words
I really do wish the best for you, even if it hurts
I hope you find yourself a better dude, one that you deserve
I hope he does what I could never do and show you what it's worth When it works, imagine love without a struggle
Just happiness and peace where the couple never crumbles
A stumble here and there, but the sound is so subtle
Cause love remains humble when the world seems to rumble
And I promise you, you won't dare forget my name
When you needed help, I'm the one who always fucking came
I'm the one who picked you up when you slipped up in the rain
I'm the one who took you back when you left me in such pain
You remember that, all that bullshit you said

[Intro]
I guess right now you've got the last laugh

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin', or, I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering
I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

[Verse 2]
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people
We can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners
I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?

[Chorus]

Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known

[Chorus]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

[Verse 2]
Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know

[Chorus]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

And there you are on your knees
Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
Just like I always wanted
But I'm so sorry

'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday
Who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now

Swagger on a hundred thousand trillion

I'm Christopher Columbus, y'all just the Pilgrims
Thanksgiving, do we even got a question?
Hermès, Pastelle, I pass the dressin'
My attitude is tattooed, that mean it's permanent
So I guess we should address it, huh?
My swagger is Mick Jagger
Every time I breathe on a track, I asthma attack it
""Why you so mad for? Why you gotta have it?""

How it feel to wake up and be the shit and the urine

(No one on the corner…) Got a bop like this
Can't wear skinny jeans, ‘cause my knots don't fit
No one on the corner got a pocket like this
So I rock Roc jeans, ‘cause my knots so thick
You can learn how to dress just by checkin' my fresh
Checkin' checkin' my fresh, checkin' checkin' my fresh
Follow my steps is the road to success
Where the niggas know you're thorough when the girls say yes
(Yes…) But I can't teach you my swag
You can pay for school, but you can't buy class
School of hard knocks, I'm a grad
And that all-blue Yankee is my graduation cap
It's Hooooovaaaa

No one on the corner has swagger like moi
Chuch, but I'm too clean for the choir
I require what I desire, I got stripes: Adidas
Mamis scream ""¡Papi, no más!""
Run up in your shit, just me, no más
Runnin' this shit like I got four thighs
No one has swagger like these four guys
Now when it comes to styles, I got several
Sharper than the swag or dagger all metal
And my jewels blue and yellow
The type of shit that make 'em call you Carmelo
Rules as follows: stay true to the ghetto
Write your name on the bullet, make you feel special
Ha! What the fuck you boys talkin' 'bout?
I know it's us, ‘cause we the only thing to talk about

You can go see Weezy for the wordplay, Jeezy for the bird play
Kanyeezy for diversity, and me for controversy
All my verses picture perfect, only spit to serve a purpose
You ain't livin' what you kickin', then you worthless
Lookin' from the surface
It may seem like I got reason to be nervous
Then observe my work to see that my adversity was worth it
Verses autobiographical, absolutely classical
Last thing I'm worried about is what another rapper do
Ain't nobody hot as me
Even if they rap they ass off, blast off and have outstandin' quality
Sell a lot of records, I'll respect it and salute that
But spittin' real life on hot beats I'm the truth at
You kick it like me, no exaggeration necessary
Livin' revolutionary, nothin' less than legendary
Gangsta shit, hereditary, got it from my dad
Flow colder than February with extraordinary swag

56,Country Boy,"[Verse 1: Aaron Lewis]
Now I grew up down an old dirt road, in a town you wouldn't know
My pops picked the place up for fifteen hundred bucks, back in nineteen sixty-four
My grandfather was a drinker, back in the day he'd put 'em down
But a war is known to change a man, and the whiskey's known to change a man

[Chorus: Aaron Lewis]
But, that's not me
I rarely drink from the bottle, but I'll smoke a little weed
I still live in the sticks where you wouldn't go, in a town of twelve hundred off an old dirt road
And a country boy, is all I'll ever be

[Verse 2: Aaron Lewis & George Jones]
Now it's been twelve years since I sold my soul, to the devil in L.A
He said sign your name here on the dotted line, and your songs they all will play
He set up shop on Sunset, he put me up at the Marquee
He said, ""You wanna sell a million records, boy? You better listen to me""

[Bridge: Aaron Lewis & George Jones]
He said, ""Change your style, whiten your smile
You could lose a couple pounds
If you want to live this life, you'd better lose that wife
Do you need your friends around?""

[Chorus: Aaron Lewis]
I said, ""no that's not me""
'Cause the biggest things in life are your friends and family
And I like my jeans and my old t-shirts, and a couple extra pounds never really hurt
'Cause a country boy, is all I'll ever be

[Verse 2: Aaron Lewis]
'Cause Hank taught me just how to stay alive
You'll never catch me out the house without my nine or fourty-five
I've got a big orange tractor and a diesel truck, and my idea of heaven's chasin' white tail bucks
And as a country boy, I know I can survive

[Verse 3: Aaron Lewis]
Now two flags fly above my land, and really sum up how I feel
One is the colors that fly high and proud, the red, the white, the blue
The other one's got a rattlesnake, with a simple statement made
""Don't tread on me"" is what it says, and I'll take that to my grave

[Chorus: Aaron Lewis]
Because, this is me
I'm proud to be American and strong in my beliefs
And I've said it before, but I'll say it again, 'cause I've never needed government to hold my hand
And I've said it before, but I'll say it again, 'cause my family's always fought and died to save this land
And a country boy, is all I'll ever be

[Outro: Charlie Daniels]
I love my country, I love my guns, I love my family, I love the way it is now
And anybody that tries to change it, has to come through me

We're driving slow through the snow on Fifth Avenue
And right now radio's all that we can hear
Now we ain't talked since we left, it's so overdue
It's cold outside, but between us, it's worse in here

[Pre-Chorus]
The world slows down
But my heart beats fast right now
I know this is the part
Where the end starts

[Chorus]
I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through our fingers
I don't wanna try now
All that's left's good-bye
To find a way that I can tell you

[Post-Chorus]
I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here
I just can't take your tears
I hate this part right here

[Verse 2]
Everyday, seven takes of the same old scene
Seems we're bound by the laws of the same routine
Gotta talk to you now before we go to sleep
But will we sleep once I tell you what's hurting me?

[Pre-Chorus]
The world slows down
But my heart beats fast right now
I know this is the part
Where the end starts

[Chorus]
I can't take it any longer
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through our fingers
I don't wanna try now
All that's left's good-bye
To find a way that I can tell you

[Post-Chorus]
I hate this part right here
I hate this part right here
I just can't take your tears
I hate this part right here

[Bridge 1]
I know you'll ask me to hold on
And carry on like nothing's wrong
But there is no more time for lies
'Cause I see sunset in your eyes

[Chorus]
I can't take it any longer (can't take this)
Thought that we were stronger
All we do is linger
Slipping through our fingers (it's slipping through our fingers)
I don't wanna try now
All that's left's good-bye (goodbye now)
To find a way that I can tell you

[Bridge 2]
That I gotta do it
I gotta do it
I gotta do it
I hate this part
I gotta do it
I gotta do it
I gotta do it

Step back!
Gonna come at you fast
I'm drivin' outta control and gettin' ready to crash
Won't stop, shakin' up what I can

So suck it down like a man

Kiss kiss, gonna tell you right now
I'll make it sweet on the lips
I'll simply knock you out
Shut up! I don't care what you say

You're gonna like it my way
Yeah, baby, there's a villain in me
So sexy, sour and sweet
And you'll be lovin' it, ah

Hold on - it keeps gettin' better
Hold on - it keeps gettin' better

[Bridge]
In the blink of an eye
In the speed of the light
I hold the universe up
While making planets collide
When I strap on my boots
And I slip on my suit
You see, the vixen in me
Becomes an angel for you

[Chorus]
Some days I'm a super bitch (super bitch)
Up to my old tricks
But it won't last forever (it won't last forever, no)
Next day, I'm your super girl (super girl)
Out to save the world
And it keeps gettin' better

59,Cowgirls Don't Cry,"[Verse 1]
Her Daddy gave her, her first pony
Then taught her to ride
She climbed high in that saddle
Fell I don't know how many times
He taught her a lesson that she learned
Maybe a little too well

[Chorus]
Cowgirls don't cry
Ride, baby, ride
Lessons in life are going to show you in time
Soon enough your going to know why
It's going to hurt every now and then
If you fall get back on again
Cowgirls don't cry

[Verse 2]
She grew up
She got married
Never was quite right
She wanted a house, a home and babies
He started coming home late at night
She didn't let him see it break her heart
She didn't let him see her fall apart

[Chorus]
Cowgirls don't cry
Ride, baby, ride
Lessons in life are going to show you in time
Soon enough your going to know why
It's going to hurt every now and then
If you fall get back on again
Cowgirls don't cry

[Verse 3]
Phone rang early one morning
Her momma's voice, she'd been crying
Said it's your daddy, you need to come home
This is it, I think he's dying
She laid the phone down by his head
The last words that he said

[Chorus-Reba McEntire]
Cowgirls don't cry
Ride, baby, ride
Lessons in life show us all in time
Too soon God will let you know why
If you fall get right back on
The good Lord calls everybody home

And I just hope she know that she the only one I yearn - for
My woman, oh I miss her, when will I learn?
Didn't give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback
Now I'm in the club thinking all about my baby
Hey, she was so easy to love
But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough
I'm going through it every time that I'm alone
And now I'm missing, wishing she pick up the phone
But she made a decision that she wanted to move on
'Cause I was wrong

[Chorus]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

[Verse 1]
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin' with you?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge

[Refrain]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this

[Chorus]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

[Verse 2]
I'm tryin' to keep it alive
And not compromise the feeling we love
You're tryin' to keep it deprived
And only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror
I know what you scared of
The feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name
I'll let the people know this is somethin' you can blame
On yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I'ma break out and then hide every lock

[Refrain]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'

[Outro]
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
You ain't heard the coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings
Now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music
I say bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

Nowhere to run and hide

Yeah, '03, I went from quite filthy to filthy rich
Man, their emotions change, so I can never trust a bitch
I tried to help niggas get on, they turned around and spit
Right in my face, so Game and Buck both can suck a dick
Now when you hear 'em it may sound like it's some other shit
‘Cause I'm not writin' anymore, they not makin' hits
I'm far from perfect, there's so many lessons I done learned
If money's evil, look at all the evil I done earned
I'm doin' what I'm supposed to, I'm a writer, I'm a fighter
Entrepreneur, fresh out the sewer, watch me maneuver
What's it to ya? The track I lace it, it's better than basic
This is my recovery, my comeback, kid

While you were sippin' your own Kool-Aid gettin' your buzz heavy
I was in the fuckin' shed, sharpenin' my machete
Sippin' on some of that revenge juice, gettin' my taste buds ready
To wolf down this spaghetti or should I say this spa-get-even?
I think you fuckin' meatballs keep on just forgettin'
Thought he was finished, motherfucker, it's only the beginnin'
He's buggin' again, he's straight thuggin', fuck who he's offendin'! (Yeah!)
He'll rip your vocal chords out and have them bitches plugged in the
Motherfuckin' wall with 3000 volts of electricity
Now take the other end of 'em, then plug them motherfuckers-in-each
One of your eye sockets 'cause I thought you might finally fuckin' see
That'll teach you to go voicin' your cocksuckin' opinion to me
I done put my blood, my sweat and my tears in this shit, fuck lettin' up!
You’re gonna end up regrettin' you ever betted against me
Feels like I'ma snap any minute, yeah, it's happenin' again
And I'm thinkin' about just sayin', ""Motherfuck everybody that's up in this bitch but 50!""
‘Cause this is all I know, this is why so hard I go
I swear to God I put my heart and soul in this more than anybody knows
I'm trapped, so all I do is rap, but every time I rap I'm more trapped
And I rap myself right to this bubble, oh I guess it's bubble wrap (Haha)
It's like a vicious cycle, my life's in a crisis
Christ, how was I supposed to know shit would turn up like it did?
Feels like I'm goin' psycho again (Ch, ch, ch, ch) and I might just blow my lid
Shit, I almost wish that I would have never made Recovery, kid
‘Cause I'm runnin' in circles with—

I haven't been this fuckin' confused since I was a kid
Sold like 40 million records, people forgot what I did
Maybe this is for me, maybe, maybe I'm supposed to go crazy
Maybe I'll do it 3 a.m. in the morning like Shady
Psycho killer, Michael Myers, I'm on fire like a lighter
Try to say this ain't classic, get yo' ass kicked mad quick
Wrap your head up in plastic, pussy, now pick the casket
Dirt nap with the maggots, it's tragic, it's sad
It's never gonna end, now we number one again
With that frown on your face and your heart full of hate
Accept it, respect it, this a gift God-given

Washed in the blood
And raised on the banks
Of the Mississippi mud

About falling in love with a bad boy

Yeah, they could see it all coming
But her daddy never dreamed
She'd grow up that fast
You know what I mean
The way a girl gets
When she turns 17
Kind of crazy

And a preacher's daughter

She kissed her mama goodbye
Said I'll be sure 'n phone you
She called from a truck stop

With amazing grace
We made California line
And then my gypsy life
Started taking its toll
And the fast lane got empty
And out of control
And just like an angel
She saved my soul from the devil

Wassup, boo? Yeah
Hahahaha, yeah

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Another shady mission
Tricks, like watching pictures in hazy vision
Tonight is love making, take you any place you wish
Today we're satisfied, yesterday we've stolen kisses
Blind insanity, perfect pictures of me and my family
Not understanding the destiny, had they planned for me?
If I have kids, will I live to see them grow?
Though I don't know
I live the life of a thug nigga until the day I go
No broken promises, a sacred bond broken
I know I die alone, but yet and still I'm hopin'
Visions of prisons, maybe I'll be forgiven
I know it's better in Heaven, ‘cause being here ain't livin'
Close my eyes and see nothing but pain, the world is crazy
Still, looking for a queen to plant seeds and have babies
Maybe I'll be the one or just maybe I'm lost
You'll never know being cautious, if you play your cards right

I wanna be the one who
Who you can depend on who

And we will be forever more

No one else can do what you do for me
Take me away from the pain I feel inside

Take your time, man (Take your time)
Don't be in such a rush (In a rush)

You got to be patient, man, be patient
It ain't going nowhere one, haha (Nowhere)
Get some champagne (Haha, be forever more)
Bring some roses or somethin', you know
Play some soft shit, light a fire (Luther Vandross)
You got to be cool with it (Teddy, Teddy)
You got to be slow with it (Ooooh, be so)

67,Let It Go,"[Verse 1]
From walking home and talking loads
To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch and getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now we're sleeping near the edge
Holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees

[Chorus]
So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

[Verse 2]
From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away

[Chorus]
So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

[Bridge]
Tryna fit your hand inside of mine
When we know it just don't belong
'Cause no force on earth could make it feel right, no, no
Tryna push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
I think now's the time to let it slide

[Breakdown]
So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Let the ashes fall, forget about me

68,Swing,"[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
When we were kids, we handpainted strawberries on a swing
Every moment was so precious, then
I'm still kicking, I'm daydreaming on a strawberry swing
The entire Earth is fighting, all the world is at its end
Just in case an atom bomb comes falling on my lawn
I should say and you should hear, I've loved
I've loved the good times here, I've loved our good times here

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Say hello, then say farewell to the places you know
We are all mortals, aren't we? Any moment this could go
Cry, cry, cry, ohh, even though that won't change a thing
But you should know, you should hear, that I have loved
I have loved the good times here, and I will miss our good times here

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
Spaceships are lifting off of a dying world
And millions are left behind while the sky burns
There wasn't room for you and I, only you, goodbye, goodbye

Put in a long hard week doing this nine to five
And you're just the girl to get that off my mind
You shouldn't have worn that dress

I miss the sound of your voice
And I miss the rush of your skin
And I miss the still of the silence
As you breathe out and I breathe in

[Pre-Chorus]
If I could walk on water
If I could tell you what's next
I'd make you believe
I'd make you forget

[Chorus]
So come on, get higher, loosen my lips
Faith and desire and the swing of your hips
Just pull me down hard
And drown me in love
So come on, get higher, loosen my lips
Faith and desire and the swing of your hips
Just pull me down hard
And drown me in love

[Verse 2]
I miss the sound of your voice
The loudest thing in my head
And I ache to remember
All the violent, sweet
Perfect words that you said

If I could walk on water
If I could tell you what's next
I'd make you believe
I'd make you forget

[Chorus]
So come on, get higher, loosen my lips

And this is wrong, but who am I to judge?

82,Krazy,"[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Tell me something I don't know
I'm flexing on 'em like torsos
These niggas slipping like bar soap
These niggas listening, use Morse code
Boy, nigga sipping like parched throat
Ahe-he-hem, excuse me?
These niggas talking that beef shit
We'll check into it like the room's cheap
And all we sell is the greatest feeling on Earth
They paint me as a villain, I just autograph the artwork
Ain't got nothing left to prove, unless I got to prove it in court
Live fast, die young, and leave a beautiful corpse, yes, Lord
My nigga order like twenty bricks
I sent five bricks with four chicks
Riding with these guns, that's carpooling
Bought extra clips when I dove in
Miss Snow White, we snowed in
Nigga, miss me with that ho shit
Kill all rats, I toast to that
And watch everybody I toast wit
Kill everybody you close with
Just don’t stick your nose in my bullshit
Cause I close it like a clothespin
The people that I rolls with
Will leave holes in what you drove in
If anyone in that car live
You tell that nigga I owe him, yeah
I got my mind right, my money right
My head on my shoulder
And my eyesight a little blurry, but
It's staying on my quota
And we find out Mom's address
And your head get mailed over
Nigga, you make that bed, you lay in that bed
Or get that bitch made over

[Verse 2]
Tell me something I don’t know
I’ll tell you something I do know
Like money, drugs, bitches, guns
Niggas call me ""Mucho""
Got witches all in my broom closet
Got little killers in JuCo
We’ll find out your business hours
And pop up like new toast
Like, danger taste like glucose
My shadow don’t get too close
To that new nigga with my old hoes: kudos
For my niggas on Rikers Island back there playing Uno
Getting swole like Popeye for niggas walking around like Bruno
I’m in the bed with a duo, laid up like two points
AK to your face; knock half off, like coupons
Too cool for school, but I sold cool points to schoolboys
Tell the cops, We don’t name drop, that's like droppin newborns
Nigga you crazy

[Interlude]
You so crazy, Tunechi
These hoes made me

[Verse 3]
Nigga tell me somethin I don't know
Like where the fuck did my heart go?
And show me somethin I haven’t seen
And give me what helped Martin sleep
On the same night he had a dream
And take me to where I’ve never been
But not to where I never be in
I ain’t never scared, but I’m scared of me
Me vs. Me, I need a referee
Need weaponry, especially if the treasury in jeopardy
Fuck deputy, big letter B
Need equity, need credit cleaned
To trafficking from peddling like everything
From amphetamines to medicine
These niggas sweeter than nectarine and Grenadine, ha!

[Hook]
You so crazy
Tunechi - you so crazy. Bitch
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
They say Tunechi, Tunechi, Tunechi, Tunechi
You so cray, bitch

[Verse 4]
Tell me somethin I don’t know
Like what happened to hard coke?
You can call me Eddie cause I stay ready
My family call me Eduardo
I’m music to these bitches ears
I hit that ass like the wrong note
My bitch bad, with corn rows
With boots on in farm clothes
You can find me prancin in the finest mansion
With the finest dancer with a height advantage
She want cocaine, pills, and weed, liquor and dick
She gotta micro manage
I'm just eatin rappers
They go nice in salads
With some diced up carrots
I just like a challenge
Psychopathic, so psychopathic
Nigga give me credit, or my balance

83,What About Now,"[Verse 1]
Shadows fill an empty heart
As love is fading
From all the things that we are
Are not saying
Can we see beyond the scars
And make it to the dawn?

[Verse 2]
Change the colors of the sky
And open up to
The ways you made me feel alive
The ways I loved you
For all the things that never died
To make it through the night
Love will find you

[Chorus]
What about now?
What about today?
What if you're making me all that I was meant to be?
What if our love never went away?
What if it's lost behind words we could never find?
Baby, before it's too late
What about now?

[Verse 3]
The sun is breaking in your eyes
To start a new day
This broken heart can still survive
With a touch of your grace
As shadows fade into the light
I am by your side
Where love will find you

What about now?
What about today?
What if you're making me all that I was meant to be?
What if our love never went away?
What if it's lost behind words we could never find?

What about now?

Now that we're here
Now that we've come this far
Just hold on
There is nothing to fear
For I am right beside you
For all my life
I am yours

What about now?
What about today?
What if you're making me all that I was meant to be?
What if our love never went away?
What if it's lost behind words we could never find?

Now, there ain't no way that you could kill the beast dead
I got Middle East women and Middle East bread
I got oil well money in the desert playing golf
Dolce shorts, dashiki with a Louis Scarf

In Dubai, 20 million on the villa loft
And then I step up in the club and then these other niggas mad as shit
The way I make the people wanna sing the hook in Arabic!

Let's go rolling on the river of love

89,When It Hurts,"Even when it hurts (x4)
Would you still put me first, even when it hurts?

Damn, remember when it was jus an idea?
It's kinda crazy how we made it here
All the pain, hard work and blood, sweat and tears
All the Bros that we lost how we wish was here
I don't like suprises, well, I just hate the stares
I know these bitches ain't shit that's why I stay prepared
My ex tried to make me jealous thinking that I cared
Forgetting bout the last bitch that took what was here
Yea, hard for me to really hurt
I wish me & Brit could make it work
See in her mind think I'm puttin other bitches first
I just wonder who she'll fuck once I'm the dirt
See I watched Myiesha and know she really love my brother
He was dead for a year, she found abother lover, damn
You can't control nothin when you gon
And it's only so long now I'm on so enjoy the moment
Ain it crazy how the brain work
Success is nothin wit no pain first
A couple million right now is what my name worth
I love my nigga much it's like we got the same Earth
Watch niggas they in a disguise
Loyalty til the end who in for the ride?
Xanies and nem perks got a nigga fried
It's like Medusa if you ever lookin in my eyes
Closest I'll get to heaven is my kids
Cos I know I gotta answer fa the shit I did
My hands too dirty for Him to forgive
I mean, it is what it is
Don't understand how I'm still blessed
I'm just tryna stop my mother's stress
Take care of the kids and the ones that my brother left
So if you tryna stop that you betta come correct
She like Albee, why I ain meet ya mother yet?
Cos you'll neva last wit the onces my mother met
I used to sneak outside whIle my mother slept
Prolly made a hundred thousand on my mother's steps, yea
Truth be told, that's a truth be told (x2)
She said Albee don't you lie to me
I said I love you girl, honestly
This is how it gotta be
I know you gettin tired uh me
I be getting tired uh me
It hurt to see you cry ta me
How long would you ride for me?
And see me as your prodigy?
Yea I know you love me but love is like a lie to me
So many people lied to me
It took so much up outta me
I'm drained (x2)
And I don't mean ta put you in the same bucket
But how I protect myself and just saying fuck it?
Hypothetically your love is just ahead of me
And I'm just tryna be a better me, me
The same thing that make you laugh could make you cry
The same thing that make you quit could make you try
I see them tears in her eyes
And it hurt me cos I'm the reason why, I'm the reason why
Why I'm still like this
I know love ain 'posed ta feel like this, it make me feel like shit
Maybe it's best for us to separate
How much you really love me? She don't hesitate
Maybe it's best for the both of us
Why you speaking up for both of us?
Albee boy I know wassup
I don't know it all but I know enough
You acting like it ain't no hope for us
And I gave you all of me
You ignoring me like I ain't show enough
Boy you grown but you ain't growing up
I know (x4)
But, this love shit you gotta brace yourself
Cos if anot her person cross me ima hate myself
And you prolly don't wanna hear it
Cursing me out, thinking I'm careless
Thinkin I don't feel shit
But I would DIE FOR YOU THAT'S REAL SHIT
You know all the pain that I dealt with?
The pain I dealt with
All this pain that I dealt with (x2)
Would you still put me first? (x2)
Even when it seems it don't work?
Even when it seems like it won't work?
Would you still put me first?
Even when it hurts...",Albee Al,2008,[91],1
90,Anything Goes,"Times have changed
And we've often rewound the clock
Since the Puritans got a shock
When they landed on Plymouth Rock
If today
Any shock they should try to stem
'Stead of landing on Plymouth Rock
Plymouth Rock would land on them

In olden days, a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking
But now, God knows
Anything goes
Good authors, too, who once knew better words
Now only use four-letter words
Writing prose
Anything goes

If driving fast cars you like
If low bars you like
If old hymns you like
If bare limbs you like
If Mae West you like
Or me undressed you like
Why, nobody will oppose
When ev'ry night the set that's smart is
Intruding at nudist parties
In studios
Anything goes

When Missus Ned McLean (God bless her)
Can get Russian reds to ""yes"" her
Then I suppose
Anything goes
When Rockefeller still can hoard en-
-ough money to let Max Gordon
Produce his shows
Anything goes

The world has gone mad today
And good's bad today
And black's white today
And day's night today
And that gent today
You gave a cent today
Once had several chateaus
When folks who still can ride in jitneys
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitneys
Lack baby clothes
Anything goes

When Sam Goldwyn can with great conviction
Instruct Anna Sten in diction
Then 'Nana' shows
Anything goes
When you hear that Lady Mendl standing up
Now turns a handspring landing up-
On her toes
Anything goes

Just think of those shocks you've got
And those knocks you've got
And those blues you've got
From those news you've got
And those pains you've got
(If any brains you've got)
From those little radios
So Missus R., with all her trimmings
Can broadcast abed from Simmons
Cause Franklin knows

91,She Got Her Own,"[Intro: Ne-Yo]
A dedication to the independent woman
To the one working hard for hers
That is just my way to let you know

[Verse 1: Jamie Foxx]
I love her 'cause she got her own
She don't need mine, she said leave mine alone
There ain't nothin that's more sexy
Than a girl that want, but don't need me
Young independent, yes she work hard
But you can't tell from the way that she walk
She don't slow 'em down, 'cause she ain't got time
To be complainin, shorty gon' shine
She don't expect nothin from no guy
She plays aggressive but she's still shy
But you'll never know her softer side, by lookin' in her eyes
Knowin' she can do for herself
Makes me wanna give her my wealth
Only kinda girl I want
Independent queen workin for her throne

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]

Don't make me laugh boo, never did that bad to

When I do that math boo, you always try to add two
I need someone who ride for me (yes), not someone who ride for free (yes)
She said boy I don't just ride, she'll pull up beside of me
I had to ask her what she doin in that caddy
She said 'cause you my baby, I be stuntin like my daddy
And there's not many catch my eye
We both wearin Gucci, she match my fly
And that's why I supposed to keep her closer
Right by the side, toaster in the holster
And now she with 'loso (uh), 'case you didn't know so (uh)

92,Get Up,"[Verse 1: Daveed Diggs]
Game don't wait (heavy. wait.)
Eyes heavy but it's time to grind motherfucker
Can't be late (hold up. wait.)
Fuck a nine-to-five, push work state-to-state (shit)
No work, no food, still eatin' off paper plates
Banana clip is a paperweight, paper mate
Tell 'em how you're married to the game
She fuckin' everybody but you still put a ring on it, on it
Keep it one hunnit, homies, home is where the homies
Home is where the homies got your back
Get your backpack get
Back to the block, bring it back to the block, shit
Slangin' crack beats cracks into Sacroiliac
But the Glock cocked back, lay another body flat

[Hook: Mariel Jacoda]
Here when they turn on the street lights
Hustle 'til they cut 'em off, that's the street life
Got the chrome on my hip and a bird for sale
That's how I get mine, that's how I get it

[Verse 2: Daveed Diggs]
Hustlin' is a habit, so they say
This is for the G's who wasn't trippin' and never knew any other way
Other ways of gettin' money, not many do not require
A degree of separation from the streets you gettin' paid in
In which the degree of difficulty is extraordinarily high
And she high while doin' it so see why
Somebody who isn't from it might not understand
How you body a body in other words (how I could just kill a man)
And still a gram is a gram and nobody is Instagramin'
They killin' on Cypress Hill and they still is squeezin' the hammers
Police is beyond the scanners, these some obsequious bandits
And brandishin' flags of function
You fuck a figure, it's fashion then flash on a motherfucker
You fuckin' seeing the passion, forgetting the hunger
This the jungle, time to get active and crack it
So acrobatic, it'll flip in a sec, but set's up and no second guessing
Here in the street, people sweating for the money

[Hook: Mariel Jacoda]
Here when they turn on the street lights
Hustle 'til they cut 'em off, that's the street life
Got the chrome on my hip and a bird for sale
That's how I get mine, that's how I get it

[Verse 3: Daveed Diggs]
No time for wifey's babies or other collateral damage
Checking for snitches, they be the ones order tacos in Spanish
Always thinking that they blendin' in, but then sending them telegrams
To the rollers, they bitches, not meaning feminine
Meaning, fuck it, ain't no explaining, get the fuck up and push cocaine
All these fuckers gon' sleep all day
But if you suck up when one of you step up to these bucks
Knock if you lacing up them chucks, no Taylor Gangin'
This shit is grimy and dirty, clothes stankin' while you slangin'
Get up out to the blacktop, backpack for the crack rock
Take shot at the cops at a spot where they knock a neighborhood watch
Watch him, learn the code if them eyes are closed
That means he sleeping on his feet and been out in the cold
And if he flashin' the gold
He either new or want action and got back up on the toes
Study all of your fractions, get up on the honor roll
Roll the marijuana then flip the hoodie up and get ghost

[Hook: Mariel Jacoda]
Here when they turn on the street lights
Hustle 'til they cut 'em off, that's the street life
Got the chrome on my hip and a bird for sale, ayy
And if you trying to take this spot, better think twice
This ain't play time, you're fucking with my life
I'ma do what I gotta do to get my mil'
I gotta get mine, I gotta get it",​clipping.,2008,"[94, 84, 64, 58, 71, 68, 61, 62, 44]",9

I'm a bad girlfriend
I'm a bad girlfriend
(Huh)

[Verse 1]
You cancel plans for me, I cancel ours on you
Say I'd be back early, I don't get in 'til 2
You ask me where I've been, I tell you something vague
Think I messed up again, what can I say?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Your mum said that she hates me, thinks I'm fucking lazy
Your friends keep on telling you to leave me 'cause I'm crazy
I do some shit you can't forgive
But you better get used to it

You trust me with your keys and I fuck up your car
You're gonna stay with me, I break your heart

You tell me your birthday, I forgot again

You should be with someone who's
Always gonna wake up with you
Always gonna tell you the truth

94,Chasing Pavements,"[Verse 1]
I've made up my mind
Don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong, I am right
Don't need to look no further
This ain't lust, I know this is love, but
If I tell the world, I'll never say enough
'Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do if I end up with you

[Chorus]
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?

[Verse 2]
I build myself up and fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops
And my back begins to tingle
Finally, could this be it, or?

[Chorus]
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere? Yeah

[Breakdown]
Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up, or should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Oh, oh

Should I give up, or should I just keep chasing pavements

Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?

I got the right to put up a fight
But not quite cause you cut off my light
But my sight is better tonight
And i might see you in my nightmare
Ooh, how'd you'd get there
Cause we were once a fairy tale
But this is farewell

I got my life and it's my only one
I got the night i'm running from the sun
So good night i'm headed off the door..
After tonight there will be no return
After tonight, i'm taking off on the rock
I'm taking off on the road

97,Dead And Gone,"[Intro: T.I.]
Ayy, let me kick it to you right quick, man
Not on some gangsta shit, man, on some real shit
Anybody done been through the same thing
I'm sure you feel the same way
Big Phil, this for you, pimpin'

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & T.I.]
Ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
And ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ever had one of them days wish you woulda stayed home
Run into a group of niggas who gettin' they hate on?
You walk by, they get wrong
You reply, then shit get blown
Way outta proportion, way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one, then rush him
Figure you get jumped, hell, that's nothin'
They don't wanna stop there, now they bustin'
Now you gushin', ambulance rushin' you
To the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus you hit four times, plus it hit yo' spine
Paralyzed waist-down, now you're wheelchair-bound
Never mind that now, you lucky to be alive
Just think, it all started, you fussin' with three guys
Now your pride in the way, but your pride is the way
You could fuck around, get shot, die any day
Niggas die everyday, all over bullshit
Dope money, dice game, ordinary hood shit
Could this be ‘cause of hip hop music?
Or did the ones with the good sense not use it?
Usually niggas don't know what to do when
Their back against the wall, so they just start shootin'
For red or for blue or for blow, I guess
From Bankhead up to yo projects

[Pre-Chorus: T.I.]
No more stress, now I'm straight
Now I get it, now I take
Time to think before I make
Mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets, I'm blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & T.I.]
Ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
And ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I ain't never been scared, I lived through tragic situation
Coulda been dead lookin' back at it
Most of that shit didn't even have to happen
But you don't think about it when you out there trappin'
In apartments, hangin', smokin' and rappin'
Niggas start shit, next thing you know, we cappin'
Get locked up, then didn't even get mad
Now think about, damn, what a life I had!
Most of that shit, look back, just laugh
Some shit, still look back, get sad
Maybe my homeboy still be around
Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time
I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga walkin' out that door
Who'da thought I'd never see Philant no more?
Got enough dead homies, I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his jaw, cost me more
I'da took that ass-whoopin' now for sure
Now, think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripes
A nigga put his hands on me, alright
Otherwise, stand there, talk shit all night
‘Cause I hit you, you sue me
I shoot you, get locked up, who? Me?

[Pre-Chorus: T.I.]
No more stress, now I'm straight
Now I get it, now I take
Time to think before I make
Mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets, I'm blessed to say

I turn my head to the East
I don't see nobody by my side

98,No Me Doy Por Vencido,"Me quedo callado
Soy como un niño dormido
Que puede despertarse
Con apenas sólo un ruido
Cuando menos te lo esperas
Cuando menos lo imagino
Sé que un día no me aguanto y voy y te miro

Y te lo digo a los gritos
Y te ríes y me tomas por un loco atrevido
Pues no sabes cuanto tiempo en mis sueños has vivido
Ni sospechas cuando te nombré

Yo, yo no me doy por vencido
Yo quiero un mundo contigo
Juro que vale la pena esperar, y esperar y esperar un suspiro
Una señal del destino
No me canso, no me rindo, no me doy por vencido

Tengo una flor de bolsillo
Marchita de buscar a una mujer que me quiera
Y reciba su perfume hasta traer la primavera
Y me enseñe lo que no aprendí de la vida
Que brilla más cada día
Porque estoy tan sólo a un paso de ganarme la alegría
Porque el corazón levanta una tormenta enfurecida
Desde aquel momento en que te ví…

Yo, yo no me doy por vencido
Yo quiero un mundo contigo
Juro que vale la pena esperar, y esperar y esperar un suspiro
Una señal del destino
No me canso, no me rindo, no me doy por vencido

Este silencio esconde demasiadas palabras
No me detengo, pase lo que pase seguiré

Yo, yo no me doy por vencido
Yo quiero un mundo contigo
Juro que vale la pena esperar, y esperar y esperar un suspiro
Una señal del destino

So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 1: Drake]
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches

Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, ""What?"" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out and goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh

There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow, fuck no
Go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake

100,Shattered Glass,"Are you buried alive?

I know you’re rotting inside but no one knows you’re hurting
You’re searching for light, but all you know is burning
Can’t find the cure for something no one can see
Can’t find the answers when there’s no room left to breath

Trapped in. The darkness swallowing
Desperate to feel yourself again
Too late. I see no hope in your eyes
Are you buried alive?

I can’t stop, my path is set
All I know is violence

I know you’re rotting inside and no one knows you’re hurting
You’re searching for light, but all you know is burning
Can’t find the cure for something no one can see
Can’t find the answers when there’s no room left to breath

Trapped in. The darkness swallowing
Desperate to feel yourself again
Too late. I see no hope in your eyes
Are you buried alive?

I’m a liar, deceiver; it dwells inside
I’m a cynic, I’m desperate to find out why
All the whispers of every last demon inside; if I listen to them, they will take my life

Silence!

Can’t find the cure for something no one can see
It won’t stop",Fit for a King,2008,[70],1

102,That's Not My Name,"[Verse 1: Katie White]
Four letter word just to get me along
It's a difficulty and I'm biting on my tongue
And I, I keep stalling, not keeping me together
People around got to find something to say now
Holding back, every day the same
Don't want to be a loner, listen to me, oh no
I never say anything at all
So with nothing to consider, they forget my name

[Chorus 1]
They call me Hell
They call me Stacey
They call me her
They call me Jane
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
They call me 'quiet' girl
But I'm a riot
Mary-Jo-Lisa
Always the same
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name

[Verse 2: Katie]
I miss the catch if they throw me the ball
I'm the last drip standing up against the wall
Keep up, falling, these heels they keep me boring
Getting clamped up and sitting on the fence now
So alone all the time at night
Lock myself away, listen to me, I'm not
Though I'm dressed up out and all
With everything considered, they forget my name

[Chorus 1: Katie]

[Chorus 2: Jules]
This song was in my head
Now it's in my mind
Call it, reach it, get some words and get some timing
And though I realize
I cannot emphasize
I'll stick around but just don't promise, nothing binding
And baby, can't you see
That you're so desperately
A standing joker like a vocal one-liner
Instead of sing-a-long
This song is monotone
I've gotta get some soul, I gotta get some feeling

Is that the way you gonna be-hiz-ave?
I know you're feeling all hurt inside
But won't you talk to a player
Let me help out your pride?
I'm like a counselor, a pastor, a priest or a psychologist
A shrink or a freak
Peep (my) my technique
I wear minks, gator boots
And I'm the the one that gets the loot
And I ain't afraid to shoot
And I love to toot toot
Beep beep as I slide up the street
I'm from the LBC
And I don't know what y'all done heard about me
But I'm a C-R-I-P with some P-I-M-P too

Pockets pad up, they come from Brinks
So what the ladies wink
You the one in the Mercedes
Shotgun with the thing
Coat chillin', watching ""The Lion King""
Crying and thangs
Cause I'm with Snoop and Nate - singing, rhyming and things
I'm out late cause I'm grinding for change
I ain't with dime for dames
Cock back and I'm trying to aim
At everything, that be hating my fame
Since regulating, been lacing the game
Ain't no mistake in the game
Two-one mother f'in dwizzle sippin on the sizzle
And that's for shizzle
Four times for the riddles
You know these bars
Everywhere we go
You know who us are
You could tell by the car
Champagn, caviar
Bubble bath, I say I love you...
And I laugh

113,Leave Out All The Rest,"[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I dreamed I was missing, you were so scared
But no one would listen 'cause no one else cared
After my dreaming, I woke with this fear
What am I leaving when I'm done here?

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So, if you're asking me, I want you to know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
When my time comes, forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
And don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

Don't be afraid, I've taken my beating

114,I'd Come For You,"[Verse 1]
Just one more moment, that's all that's needed
Like wounded soldiers in need of healing
Time to be honest, this time I'm pleading
Please don't dwell on it, 'cause I didn't mean it
I can’t believe I said I'd lay our love on the ground
But it doesn't matter 'cause I've made it up, forgive me now
Every day I spend away, my soul's inside out
Gotta be some way that I can make it up to you now, somehow

[Chorus]
By now you'd know that I'd come for you
No one but you, yes, I'd come for you
But only if you told me to
And I'd fight for you
I'd lie, it's true
Give my life for you
You know I'd always come for you

[Verse 2]
I was blindfolded, but now I'm seeing
My mind was closing, now I'm believing
I finally know just what it means to let someone in
To see the side of me that no one does or ever will
So if you're ever lost and find yourself all alone
I'd search forever just to bring you home
Here and now, this I vow

[Chorus]
By now you'd know that I'd come for you
No one but you, yes, I'd come for you
But only if you told me to
And I'd fight for you
I'd lie, it's true
Give my life for you
You know I'd always come for you
You know I'd always come for you

No matter what, remember you know I'll always come for you

But only if you told me to
And I'd fight for you
I'd lie, it's true
Give my life for you
You know I'd always come for you

No matter what gets in my way
As long as there's still life in me

It was 1989, my thoughts were short my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen and she was far from in-between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah

[Verse 1]
Splashing through the sand bar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life, like when and where
We didn't have no internet
But man, I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"" all summer long

Catching wild life from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock and roll

Now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
Or how we thought those days would never end

And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride

[Chorus 1]
If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late

Against the grain should be a way of life

Don't let it slip away
Could be our only one, you know it's only just begun
Every single day
Maybe our only one, what if tomorrow never comes?
Tomorrow never comes

[Bridge]
Time is going by so much faster than I
And I'm starting to regret not telling all of this to you

[Chorus]
You're never gonna be alone
From this moment on
If you ever feel like letting go
I won't let you fall
When all hope is gone, I know that you can carry on
We’re gonna take the world on
I'll hold you 'til the hurt is gone

I'm gonna be there always
I won't be missing one more day
I'm gonna be there always

120,Waitin' On A Woman,"[Verse 1]
Sitting on a bench at West Town Mall
He sat down in his overalls and asked me
You Waiting on a woman
I nodded yeah and said how 'bout you
He said son since nineteen fifty-two I've been
Waiting on a woman

[Verse 2]
When I picked her up for our first date
I told her I'd be there at eight
And she came down the stairs at eight-thirty
She said I'm sorry that I took so long
Didn't like a thing that I tried on
But let me tell you son she sure looked pretty
Yeah she'll take her time but I don't mind
Waiting on a woman

[Verse 3]
He said the wedding took a year to plan
You talk about an anxious man, I was nervous
Waiting on a woman
And then he nudged my arm like old men do
And said, I'll say this about the honeymoon, it was worth it
Waiting on a woman

[Verse 4]
And I don't guess we've been anywhere
She hasn't made us late I swear
Sometimes she does it just cause she can do it
Boy it's just a fact of life
It'll be the same with your young wife
Might as well go on and get used to it
She'll take her time because you don't mind
Waiting on a woman

[Verse 5]
I've read somewhere statistics show
The man's always the first to go
And that makes sense cause I know she won't be ready
So when it finally comes my time
And I get to the other side
I'll find myself a bench, if they've got any
I hope she takes her time, cause I don't mind
Waiting on a woman

121,Another Way to Die,"[Verse 1: Jack White & Alicia Keys]
Another ringer with the slick trigger finger for Her Majesty
Another one with the golden tongue poisoning your fantasy
Another bill from a killer, turned a thriller to a tragedy

[Chorus: Jack White & Alicia Keys]
Yeah, a door left open, a woman walking by
A drop in the water, a look in your eye
A phone on the table, a man on your side
Or someone that you think that you can trust
It's just another way to die

[Verse 2: Jack White & Alicia Keys]
Another tricky little gun giving solace to the one
That'll never see the sun shine
Another inch of your life sacrificed for your brother, in the nick of time
Another dirty money, heaven sent honey, turning on a dime

[Chorus: Jack White & Alicia Keys]
Well, a door left open, a woman walking by
A drop in the water, a look in your eye
A phone on the table, a man on your side
Or someone that you think that you can trust
It's just another way to die

It's just another
Hey!
It's just another
You're nothing to me, die
It's just another
Shoot 'em, bang bang!

Another girl with her finger on the world
Singing to you what you wanna hear
Another gun thrown down in surrender took away your fear, hey
Another man there, he stands right behind you looking in the mirror

[Chorus: Jack White & Alicia Keys]
A door left open, a woman walking by
A drop in the water, a look in the eye
A phone on the table, a man on your side
Or someone that you think that you can trust

Seven Thirty-five
She's someone else’s wife
I can get on with my life
And that thrills me
She married him today
Her daddy gave the bride away
I heard a tear roll down her face
And that kills me

[Break]
'Cause now I
Can see why
She's finally crying

[Chorus]
How was I supposed to know?
She was slowly letting go?
If I was putting her through her hell
Hell I couldn't tell
She could've given me a sign
Could've opened up my eyes
How was I supposed to see?
She never cried in front of me

[Verse 2]
Yeah, maybe I might’ve changed
It's hard for me to say
But the story's still the same
It's a sad one
And I'll always believe
If she ever did cry for me
They were tears that you can't see
You know the bad ones

[Break]
And now I
Can see why
She's finally crying

How was I supposed to know?
She was slowly letting go?
If I was putting her through her hell

Could've opened up my eyes
How was I supposed to see?
She never cried in front of me

Without a doubt
I know now
How it outta be
Now she's gone
And it's wrong
And it bothers me
Tomorrow I'll still be
Asking myself

How was I supposed to know?
She was slowly letting go?
If I was putting her through her hell

When your eyes are still red I will stand with you

124,Ride,"[Verse 1]
I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
I know it's hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind
I know it's hard sometimes
Yeah, I think about the end just way too much
But it's fun to fantasize
On my enemies I wouldn't wish who I was
But it's fun to fantasize (Size, size)

Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride
Takin' my time on my ride

[Verse 2]
""I'd die for you,"" that's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them, a bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many bullets comin' through
See many bullets comin' through
Metaphorically, I'm the man
But literally, I don't know what I'd do
""I'd live for you,"" an' that's hard to do
Even harder to say when you know it's not true
Even harder to write when you know that tonight
There were people back home who tried talkin' to you
But then you ignore them still
All these questions they're for real
Like who would you live for? Who would you die for?
And would you ever kill?

[Chorus]
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride
Takin' my time on my ride

127,Forever & Always,"[Verse 1]
Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night, you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down
We almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect, now you're halfway out the door

[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

[Verse 2]
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so

Oh, back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?

It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said forever and always

128,The Way I Loved You,"[Verse 1]
He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine

[Chorus]
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

[Verse 2]
He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable

[Chorus]
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2am and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

[Bridge]
He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating
Intoxicating, complicated
Got away by some mistake and now

I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2am and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane

129,Fifteen,"[Verse 1]
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the morning of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""You know, I haven't seen you around before""

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen feeling like there's nothing to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen

[Verse 2]
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feeling like flying
And your momma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one
And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

[Bridge]
When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
Who changed his mind and we both cried

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen

Talkin', true blue, out in the woods, down home, country girl

She's a hot little number in her pickup truck
Daddy's sweet money done jacked it up
She's a party all nighter from South Carolina
A bad mamajama from down in Alabama
She's a ragin' cajun, a lunatic from Brunswick
Juicy Georgia peach with a thick southern drawl
Sexy swing and walk, brother, she's all

From the songs she plays to the prayers she prays
That's the way she was born and raised
She ain’t afraid to stay

A hell raisin' sugar when the sun goes down
Mama taught her how to rip up the town
Honey drippin' honey from the holler in Kentucky
Get you flippin', kinda trippy like a Mississippi hippie

Crazy mother trucker, undercover lover
Thick southern drawl, sexy swing and walk
Brother, she's all

But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked we were talking

Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone

Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

Hey Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same

They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine
Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you?

[Chorus]
I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself
If you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

133,Troublemaker,"[Intro: Flo Rida]
You're a troublemaker, you're a troublemaker
You ain't nothing but a troublemaker, girl

[Verse 1]
You had me hooked again from the minute you sat down
The way you bite your lip got my head spinnin' around
After a drink or two I was putty in your hands
I don't know if I have the strength to stand, oh oh oh...

[Pre-Chorus]
Trouble troublemaker, yeah, that's your middle name, oh oh oh...
I know you're no good but you're stuck in my brain
And I wanna know...

[Chorus]
Why does it feel so good but hurt so bad, oh oh oh?
My mind keeps saying
""Run as fast as you can""
I say, ""I'm done,"" but then you pull me back, oh oh oh...
I swear you're giving me a heart attack
Troublemaker!

[Verse 2]
It's like you're always there in the corners of my mind
I see a silhouette every time I close my eyes
There must be poison in those finger tips of yours
Cause I keep comin' back again for more, oh oh oh...

[Pre-Chorus]
Trouble troublemaker, yeah, that's your middle name, oh oh oh...
I know you're no good but you're stuck in my brain

[Verse 3: Flo Rida]
Maybe I'm insane
Cause I keep doing the same damn thing
Thinking one day we gon' change
But you know just how to work that back
And make me forget my name
What the hell you do, I won't remember
I'll be gone until November
And you'll show up again next summer, yeah!
Typical middle name is Prada
Fit you like a glove, girl
I'm sick of the drama
You're a troublemaker
But damn, girl, it's like I love the trouble
And I can't even explain why

134,You Belong With Me,"[Verse 1]
You're on the phone with your boyfriend, he's upset
He's going off about something that you said
Cause he doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of bands he doesn't like
And he'll never know your story like I do

[Pre-Chorus 1]
He wears jerseys, I wear t-shirts
He's team captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you can see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me
You belong with me!

[Verse 2]
Walking the streets with you in your worn out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
""Hey, isn't this easy?""
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since he brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doin' with a dick like that?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I wear Toms and he wears sneakers
He's banging your friend underneath the bleachers
I'm dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus 2]
If you can see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know, baby
You belong with me

[Bridge]
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
I think I know where you belong
I think I know it's with me

[Breakdown]
Why can't you just fucking see?
Why can't you just fucking see?
You belong to me
You belong to me
You belong to me

[Chorus 2]
If you can see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know, baby
You belong with me

135,You're Not Sorry,"[Verse 1]
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around

[Chorus]
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)

[Verse 2]
You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before

[Chorus]
But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)
You're not sorry (No no no no)

[Bridge]
You had me crawling for you, honey and it never would have gone away, no
You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade

[Chorus]
So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)
You're not sorry (No no no no)
(No, no, no...)",Taylor Swift,2008,"[35, 11]",2

137,Bleeding Love,"[Verse 1]
Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen
But something happened for the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground
Found something true
And everyone's looking round thinking I'm going crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

[Chorus]
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

[Verse 2]
Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from falling
But nothing's greater than the risk
That comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

[Chorus]
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

[Bridge]
And it's draining all of me
Though they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearing these scars for everyone to see

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love

Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll be my American boy

He said, ""Hey, sister, it's really, really nice to meet ya.""
I just met this 5-foot-7 guy who's just my type
Like the way he's speakin', his confidence is peakin'
Don't like his baggy jeans but I might like what's underneath them
And, no, I ain't been to MIA
I heard that Cali never rains and New York's wide awake
First let's see the West End, I'll show you to my bredrin

Holler at the next chick soon as you're blinking
What's your persona about this Americana rhymer?
Am I shallow ‘cause all my clothes designer?
Uh, dressed smart like a London bloke
Before he speak his suit bespoke
And you thought he was cute before
Look at this pea coat, tell me he's broke
And I know you ain't into all that
I heard your lyrics, I feel your spirit
But I still talk that ca-a-ash
'Cause a lot of wags want to hear it
And I'm feeling like Mike at his baddest
Like The Pips at their gladdest
And I know they love it

Next thing I knew, they ripped me from my bed
And then they took my blood type
It left a strange impression in my head
You know that I was hoping
That I could leave this star-crossed world behind
But when they cut me open
I guess that changed my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
And you know I might
Have just flown too far from the floor this time
'Cause they're calling me by my name
And they're zipping white light beams
Disregarding bombs and satellites

That was one lonely night

The dream maker's gonna make you mad

Well now I'm back at home, and
I'm looking forward to this life I live
You know it's gonna haunt me
So hesitation to this life I give
You think you might cross over
You're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
You'd better look it over
Before you make that leap

[Pre-Chorus]
And you know I’m fine
But I hear those voices at night sometimes
They justify my claim
And the public don’t dwell on
My transmission ‘cause it wasn’t televised
But it was the turning point

Broke my parole to have a good time
When I got home it was 6 AM
The door was locked so I kicked it in
She was trippin on the bills
I think she was high on some pills
She threw my things out into the yard
Then she called me a bum and slapped me real hard
And in my drunken stupor
I did what I should have never done
And now I'm sittin here, talking to you
Drunk and on the run

I'm sittin' at a bar on the inside
Waitin' for my ride on the outside
She stole my heart, in the trailer park
So I jacked the keys to her fathers car
Crashed that Chevrolet and then stepped away

You know moe I'll probably get ten years
So just give me beers till they get here
Yea I know the sun is comin up
And y'all are probably get ready for closin up
But I'm trying to drown my soul
I'm tired of this life on the dirt road
And everything that I love is gone
And I'm tired of hangin on

Shes got me
I'm sittin' at a bar on the inside
Waitin' for my ride on the outside
She stole my heart, in the trailer park
So I jacked the keys to her fathers car
And crashed that Chevrolet and then stepped away

Guess it was meant to be
Romance is misery
So much for memories
And now I am headed to the penitentiary
See me on TV
The next cop series
I am a danger
I guess I should've did something about my anger
But I never learn
Real things I don't concern
I pour kerosene on everything I love
And watch it burn
I know it's my fault
But I wasn't happy it was over
She threw a fit
So I crashed that piece of shit Nova

And now I am going back again
Back to the pen to see my friends
When we all pile off that county van
They'll ask me where I've been
I've been at a bar on the inside
Waitin' for my ride on the outside
She stole my heart, in the trailer park
So I jacked the keys to her fathers car
Then crashed that Chevrolet and then stepped away

143,My President,"[Intro: Young Jeezy]
Yeah, be the realest shit I never wrote
I ain't write this by the way, nigga
Some real shit right here, nigga
This'll be the realest shit you ever quote
Let's go!

[Hook: Young Jeezy]
My president is black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My mama ain't at home and Daddy's still in jail
Tryna make a plate, anybody seen the scale?
My president is black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My money's light green and my Jordans light grey
And they love to see white, now how much you tryna pay?
Let's go!

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
Today was a good day, hope I have me a great night
I don't know what you fishin' for, but catch you a great white
Me, I see great white, heavy as killer whales
I cannot believe this, who knew it came in bales?
Who knew what came with jail?
Who knew what came with prison?
Just 'cause you got opinions, does that make you a politician?
Bush robbed all of us, would that make him a criminal?
And then he cheated in Florida, would that make him a Seminole?
I say, and I quote, ""We need a miracle.""
And I say a miracle 'cause this shit is hysterical
By my nephews and nieces, I will email Jesus
Tell him forward to Moses and CC Allah
Mr. Soul Survivor, guess that make me a Konvict
Be all you can be, now don't that sound like some dumb shit
When you die over crude oil as black as my nigga Bu
It's really a Desert Storm, that's word to my nigga Clue
Catch me in Las Vegas, A.R., Arizona
Rep for them real niggas, I'm winnin' in California
Winnin' in Tennessee, hands down Atlanta
Landslide Alabama, on my way to Savannah

[Hook: Young Jeezy]

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
I said I woke up this mornin', headache this big
Pay all these damn bills, feed all these damn kids
Buy all these school shoes, buy all these school clothes
For some strange reason my son addicted to Polo's
Love me some spinach dip, I'm addicted to Houston's
And if the numbers is right I'll take a trip out to Houston
An earthquake out in China, a hurricane in New Orleans
Street Dreams Tour, I showed my ass in New Orleans
Did it for Soulja Slim, brought out B.G.
It's all love, Bun, I'm forgivin' you, Pimp C
You know how the Pimp be, that nigga gon' speak his mind
If he could speak down from Heaven he'd tell me stay on my grind
Tell him I'm doin' fine, Obama for mankind
We ready for damn change so y'all let the man shine
Stuntin' on Martin Luther, feelin' just like a king
Guess this is what he meant when he said that he had a dream

[Hook: Young Jeezy]

[Verse 3: Nas]
Yeah, our history, black history
No president ever did shit for me
Had to hit the streets, had to flip some keys
So a nigga won't go broke
Then they put us in jail, now a nigga can't go vote
So I spend dough on these hoes strippin'
She ain't a politician, honey's a pole-itician
My president is black, Rose golden charms
22-inch rims like Hulk Hogan's arms
When thousands of peoples is riled up to see you
That can arouse your ego
We've got mouths to feed so
Gotta stay true to who you are and where you came from
'Cause at the top will be the same place you hang from
No matter how big you can ever be
For whatever fee or publicity, never lose your integrity
For years there's been some prize horses in this stable
Just two albums in, I'm the realest nigga on this label
Mr. Black President, yo, Obama for real
They gotta put your face on the 5000 dollar bill

[Hook: Young Jeezy]
My president is black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too

I guess we’re doing, uh, too drunk to fuck right?

[Verse 1]
I hit the bottle in the morning in the summer time
I quit my job because it gets in the way
Find a party by the ocean, buy the cheapest wine
Called up my friends to come and waste the day
I got a dime bag, corduroys, coloured sleeves
And a bindle and some LSD
Now I'm just looking for a girl to meet
To help me forget my name

[Hook]
I could spend my lifetime getting high
Never wanna live in a suit and tie
Most of us are just living a lie
That’s why we get fucked up every night
I'm getting drunk all night
Oh I'm getting drunk all day
Oh I'm getting drunk all night
I'm sorry but I have to say, I'm too drunk to fuck (ya)
(I'm sorry but I have to say, I'm too drunk to fuck ya)

[Verse 2]
Now the party was jumping and the girls were flying
With the lipstick summer glaze
Got so many women coming after me
I put some pussy on lay away
I was smoked out, tore up, drunk as fuck
And I wouldn't wanna change a thing
Young and dumb and full of cum
With a sugar loaded candy cane

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I can’t eat, can’t sleep and I'm bored as fuck
And the girl I want just walked away
She just found out I'm too drunk to fuck
Looks like I'm not getting laid

And she loved you
And she's gone
It's over, isn't it?
Why can't I move on?

[Verse 2]
War and glory, reinvention
Fusion, freedom, her attention
Out in daylight, my potential
Bold, precise, experimental
Who am I now in this world without her?
Petty and dull, with the nerve to doubt her
What does it matter? It's already done
Now I've got to be there for her son

[Chorus]
It's over, isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it over?
It's over, isn't it?

And she loved you

151,Country Man,"[Verse 1]
You need hands, rough not soft
To come and warm you up, up in that cold hayloft
Let me hold you little darling in my big strong arms
Can't get these kind of muscles anywhere but a farm

Hey, I'm a country man
A city boy can't do the things I can
I can grow my own groceries and salt cure a ham
Hey baby, I'm a country man

That way nobody sees us parked back up in these trees
Your little iPod loaded down with Hoobastank

But girl, I'm here to tell you, don't believe the hype

152,The Day That Never Comes,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Born to push you 'round
Better just stay down
You pull away, he hits the flesh, you hit the ground
Mouth so full of lies
Tend to black your eyes
Just keep them closed, keep praying, just keep waiting

[Chorus]
Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the son shine never comes, no
No, the son shine never comes

[Verse 2]
Push you cross that line
Just stay down this time
Hide in yourself, crawl in yourself, you'll have your time
God, I'll make them pay
Take it back one day
I'll end this day, I'll splatter color on this gray

[Chorus]
Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the son shine never comes, no

[Bridge]
Love is a four letter word
And never spoken here
Love is a four letter word
Here in this prison
I suffer this no longer
I'll put an end to this, I swear
This, I swear, the son will shine
This, I swear! This, I swear!
This! I! Swear!

And she’s an actress (Actress), but she ain’t got no need
She’s got money from her parents in a trust fund back East
T—t—t—tongues always pressed to your cheeks
While my tongue is on the inside of some other girl’s teeth

That I’m a vegetarian and I ain’t fucking scared of him

Washed them in the bathroom to drink like the bands

All I ever wanted was to get my family out the hood
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to see you smile and know you're good
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to get my homies out the hood
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to see her smile and know she good

[Verse 1: Montana of 300]
All I ever wanted was to make a fucking difference
Knew a lot that never did it
Tryna be the one who did it
Grew up in the project building
Witnessed dealings and some killings
Devil grinning with how we living
Niggas sinning just to get it
Used to go to bed at night while watching roaches on the ceiling
Taking turns with plates and fork
Because there wasn't enough dishes
Taught to share with all my siblings, If I got it they can get it
I remember watching my OG get high up in the kitchen
I remember finding pipes she hid up in the oven mitten
How I used to throw them out
The ninth floor window like I'm pitching
Then act like I never did it
Thinking that would make her quit it
I still pray to God for healing
If you're real I know you hear me (Ahhhh)

All I ever wanted was to make it to the top
Used to look up to my Pops, and all he played was Big and Pac
I figured if I rapped like them well maybe i could get this guap
Put me on TV, I can't see me in no can or in no box
Never thought I had to hussle, never thought I'd tote these Glocks
Never thought I fight them cases, sleeping counties on a cot
Niggas think shit funny til this 40 gets to singing, Jamie Foxx
You beef with me then bodies drop
Boy you dont want to be my opps
And I dont leave no witnesses so can't nobody can tell the cops
Niggas snitching, choppers take them out the picture when I crop
Never planned on popping pussies or nobody getting shot
But I ain't never complain about mine, Nigga you know how I rock

All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to get my family out the hood

All I ever wanted was to see you smile and know you're good
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to get my homies out the hood
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to see her smile and know she good

[Bridge: Dallas Eli]
All I ever wanted, was to give my people hope
And get their backs up off the ropes
Make my people proud, keep your heads above the clouds
Bought my momma a big ol' house, I just wanna see you smile

[Verse 3: Montana of 300]
All I ever wanted was my OG off of drugs
Used to wash clothes in the tub, Never thought I'd be the plug
All I ever wanted was to make it with this rapping
First I'll trap and get to stacking and invest and make it happen
All I ever wanted to see my niggas shine
Never thought that you would be jealous
You was hating all the time
Had that fuck shit on your mind, don't know how you was designed
But the Lord didn't make me blind, I know how to read them signs

[Hook: Dallas Eli & Montana of 300]
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to get my family out the hood

She was heading to the microphone he was ready for the show
She was standing right next to him cheering everyone’s applause

Then she started singing with a voice, a lovely piece of jewel
He was rock n rolling his guitar – and the crowd went Oh so wild!

Bridge:
And when he started to sing along with her all their inner blues everybody felt the muse

Chorus:
And all the people used to sing - altogether with Johnny and June!
He used to look into her eyes while the music was getting high

Verse 2
He was loving her with all his soul she was afraid of his inner mood
He was walking over all the rules but he kept playing all the tunes!

Bridge:
He used to ask her for more, marry me! Oh baby please! Let’s together feel the muse

Chorus:

And everybody shouted loud – yeah come on Johnny & June!
Then he took her by surprise and he kissed her deep and wild!

166,Be OK,"[Produced by Remo]

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Even if I don't stay
Everything will be okay
Everything will be okay
Everything will be okay
(Okay, okay)

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Contemplatin' just who I coulda turned out to be
If I'da stayed and weren’t heard, what would amount to me?
If I had looked and ain’t found what I have found in me
I mean inside, would they love me? Never looked down on me?
They say, ""You know, if you loved her well then you would have stayed
You could have made a perfect pair that people wouldn't trade""
Trade for nothing, I did though, I had to chase it
Face it, I wasn’t born to live a life basic
They say, ""You turned your back on us just to go and be
An artist, what's a promise anyway when someone breaks it?
I bet he finally gets a shot and then he wastes it
I bet he don’t come back for us when he makes it
And if he do it'd be too late, you gotta face it
'Cause by then there's someone new you been replaced with
Old friends I grew up with, the girl I fell in love with
Love or hate me depending on how you judge it

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Even if I don't stay
(Even if I don't stay)
Everything will be okay
Everything will be okay
(I promise it'll be okay)
Everything will be okay
(Okay, okay)

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
I had to wander, I had to go tread my own path
If you don't step through no mud, well then it won't last
The years pass, it's crazy how they go fast
Ask myself questions you have, but that you won't ask
Like, ""You don’t even come home enough
Where were you when she was in the hospital, huh? It was only us""
And that’s deep and yeah, I know it cuts
But if that gets you, then you’re weak 'cause we were here and it ain’t broken us
Still as close and stayed by her side when no one was
Like when she lost her job and everything, how broke we was
When she was sick and she needed some taking care of
A fifteen year old shouldered the weight and what he was scared of
The worst, I know that you stayed strong
I don’t say this enough, but you made me just as proud as you made Mom
Yeah, you got some anger, but I don’t blame you at all
I know I don't call, but you're my brother
I love ya

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Even if I don't stay
(Even if I don't stay)
Everything will be okay
(It’ll be, it'll be okay)
Everything will be okay
(I promise it'll be okay)
Everything will be okay
(Okay, okay)

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Yeah, in that first grade class they came and got me
""Your mom's outside, say goodbye now to everybody""
U-Haul was waiting with all of her things, at least what she could pack
In the time my dad's at work and before he came back
Way too young to comprehend what was happenin'
""Are we going to grandma's? When are we coming back again?""
Little did I know that we were leaving him by himself
And ten years would pass before Mom sees anybody else
Just us, in middle school, I ain't understand
Who Melissa was and why she wasn't another man
Biased and confused, they try explain, but nobody can
Wanted what I thought was normal, she had another plan
Such is life, even if it took time for me to accept it
No longer Dad now, but a woman with whom she slept with
Over the years when a secret was how she kept it
I ain't get it, admittedly I was skeptic
I came around, happiness I see's what you may have found
And that's what's most important, I don’t wanna see you breaking down
I wanna see you smile, I don't wanna see you make a frown
If she loves you, then that's all anybody needs maybe now
By '05 things had gotten worse
Moved to the basement, deep depression's a rotten curse
Hidin' in a dark space, her mind and her body hurts
Becomin' more reclusive and the pills should have been alerts
So the worse it got, I became more and more afraid
Until one night, I went into that room, on the floor she laid
I shook her, she was blue, her skin was cold and she wasn't breathin'
Screamed, ""Melissa wake up,"" couldn't fathom that she was leavin'
Mom and Bro was runnin' down, I screamed ""Somebody help""
Try pumping her chest, CPR, but it didn’t help
Toughest pill to swallow, but we lost, that’s forced reflection
While in her life you made her happy, thank you for the blessin'

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Even if I don't stay
(Even if I don't stay)
Everything will be okay
(It’ll be, it'll be okay)
Everything will be okay
(I promise it'll be okay)
Everything will be okay
(Okay, okay)",G-Eazy,2008,[91],1

Te burlaste de mí y me humillaste
Lejo' de aquí te fuiste y ni explicaste
Viste mi película y viraste

Me siento cabrón porque no estás aquí
Así como viniste tú te puedes ir (Te puedes ir; ¡uh-yeh!)

No te voy a negar que te sufrí, la pasé mal

Y de mi vida te saqué, yo te saqué
Bebé, yo te boté

I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong It felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it, I liked it

No, I don't even know your name It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what Good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chap stick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong It felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it, I liked it

Us girls we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

I kissed a girl and I liked it

174,When I Grow Up,"[Verse 1]
Yeah, when I grow up, you know what I wanna be?
Take a seat, let me tell you my ridiculous dreams
I wanna rap, yeah, I know it's hard to believe
And I can tell you're already thinkin' I will never succeed
But I'm okay with it, I admit the lyrics are weak
I've been workin' on 'em, I'll be good eventually
I understand you gotta crawl before you get to your feet
But I been running for a while, they ain't ready for me, ahh
I know this prolly isn't really realistic
And honestly, I might not ever make a difference
But that don't make a difference, I'ma have to risk it
I've been crunchin' numbers, you ain't gotta be a mathematician
To see the odds ain't rootin' for me
I can't lie though, it's kinda how I like it to be
The underdog, yeah, you prolly think you know what I mean
But what I'm saying is they ever push me, I'm gonna swing, yeah
I could go to college, get in debt like everybody else
Graduate and prolly get a job that doesn't pay the bills
That don't make a lot of sense to me, forget the Happy Meals
I don't like the dollar menu, I would rather make a meal
Huh? Make a mil'? Nah, I said make a meal
Home-cookin', get the grill, how you want it? Pretty well?
Everything I see is overdone to me, I'm not Adele
But I'ma get a record deal and say hello to mass appeal

[Chorus]
When I grow up, I just want to pay my bills
Rappin' about the way I feel (Oh, yeah)
I just want to make a couple mil'
Leave it to the fam in the will (Oh, yeah)
I just want to sign a record deal
Maybe buy a house up in the hills (Oh, yeah)
Might not be the best in my field
But I guarantee that I'ma die real
When I grow up

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, ayy
When I grow up
Yeah, yeah, ayy

[Verse 2]
I'ma make 'em notice me, rhymin' like it's poetry
Everything I oversee, I just like to overthink
Mockin' me, you pay the fee, no return and no receipts
Those of you that don't believe, quiet, you don't know a thing
Quiet when I'm tryna sing, quiet when I'm making beats
Quiet when I'm tryna think, sorry, I don't mean to scream
I just feel like no one really gets me and it's sad to see
'Cause someday I'ma grow up and show all of you it's meant to be (Yeah)
Anybody wanna hear me rap? ""No""
Come on, let me play a couple tracks, ""No""
Come on, I can spit it really fast, ""No""
You think I should throw this in the trash? ""No""
Tricked ya; haters, go away before I hit ya
I am not a beggar or a kiss-up
You don't understand? Well, I forgive ya
I am not a quitter, you ain't really think that, did ya?
Maybe someday I could even be up on the radio
Have a tour bus and maybe even play a couple shows
Everybody in the crowd singing every word I wrote
Tellin' me that I am not the only one that feels alone
Huh? You feel alone? Yeah, I kinda feel alone
Wonder if that feelin' ever goes away when you get old
Will I ever make it as an artist? I don't really know
Might not make a lot of dough
I'ma have to try it, though

[Chorus]
When I grow up
I just wanna pay my bills
Rappin' about the way I feel (Oh, yeah)
I just wanna make a couple mil'
Leave it to the fam in the will (Oh, yeah)

I just wanna sign a record deal
Maybe buy a house up in the hills (Okay, oh, yeah)
Might not be the best in my field (Ayy, ayy, yeah)
But I guarantee that I'ma die real
When I grow up
I just wanna pay my bills (Woo)
Rappin' about the way I feel (Oh, yeah)
(Yeah, the way I feel)
Yeah, I just wanna make a couple mil' (Ayy, couple mil')
Leave it to the fam in the will (Oh, yeah, to the fam in the will)
I just wanna sign a record deal (Woo)

175,Headfirst Slide Into Cooperstown On A Bad Bet,"[Verse 1]
Mr. Sandman showing his beam
When he walks into the room the walls lean in to listen
Surfed out brain waves flick back and forth
Like old headlights sniffing model glue again
Head like a steel trap, wish I didn't, I didn't
I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I don't
Just want to be a footnote
In someone else's happiness

[Pre-Chorus]
Does your husband know the way
That the sunshine gleams from your wedding band?
Does he know the way, does he know the way
Of the crickets that would convince me to call it a night?

[Chorus]
But I will never end up like him
Behind my back, I already am
Keep a calendar, this way you will always know
The last time you came through
Oh darling, I know what you're going through
The last time you came through
Oh darling, oh darling, oh darling

[Verse 2]
Aw, tempest in a teacup, get unique
Peroxide princess, shine like shark teeth
It's a sign (it's a sign), it's a sign (it's a sign)
It's a sign, what if you peaked early?

[Pre-Chorus]
Does your husband know the way
That the sunshine gleams from your wedding band?
Does he know the way, does he know the way
Of the crickets that would convince me to call it a night?
Does he, does he know the way
I worship our love?
Does your husband know the way
That the sunshine gleams from your wedding band?

[Chorus]
But I will never end up like him
Behind my back, I already am
Keep a calendar, this way you will always know
The last time you came through
Oh darling, I know what you're going through
The last time you came through
Oh darling, oh darling, oh darling

Does your husband know? Does your husband know?
Does your husband know? Does he know?

I got my feet on the street but I can't stop flying
My head's in the clouds but at least I'm trying
I'm out of control but I'm tied up tight

There's a hole in the ground into which I'm falling
So godspeed to the sound of the pounding
I'm all into the blinding light
Come in, come out, come in, come out tonight

179,You Look Good In My Shirt,"[Verse 1]
When you walked up behind me and covered my eyes
And whispered in my ear, guess who
I rattled off names like I really didn't know
But all along I knew it was you

And, the longer we talked, the more we laughed
And wondered why we didn't last
It had been a long time, but later last night
Baby, we caught up real fast

[Chorus]
And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is going to work
All I know is you're sure looking
Good in my shirt
That's right
You look good in my shirt

Well now I'm not saying that we solved overnight
Every way that we went wrong
Oh, but what I'm seeing I'd sure love seeing
Every morning from now on

And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is going to work
All I know is you're sure looking
Good in my shirt

Eh, yeah

182,Leavin',"[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah (I knew this day was coming)
Sometimes, you gotta come back down (It's all going to hell now, man)
Stoop to someone's level (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Five dozen flies buzzin' over your head
Call me the Grim Reaper, sleep is my cousin
You're dead to me now and I'ma be the last face you see
'Fore you die cussin' (Yep)
My eye a tiger's and I'm a survivor so I will rise up and (What?)
Be triumphant 'cause when I'm looking at my legacy (Leg, I see)
Bunch of dogs tryna dry hump it
Like Triumph The Puppet, so I'm like, ""Fuck it""
Pile the carnage up 'til it's so high, it's touching the sky
Let 'em all line up and attack
Single filing up in the stack
Call 'em toy soldiers (Yeah)
'Cause they just wind up on their backs
Now the sky's nothing but black
But I am not coming back, I done told ya
I told the woke me to go to sleep
But still, they keep on provoking me
They're hoping to see me completely broken emotionally
But how in the fuck am I not supposed to be woke
When these fuckers just keep poking me? Now

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm leaving Heaven
I'm leaving Heaven
Angels won't find me
Where I am going

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I've been down, kicked
Like around six thousand times since I was a kid
As a child, picked on, clowned, been
Countless times I've been outed
Gotta remind myself of it every now and then (Yeah)
So the route I went's self-empowerment
In a hole, taught myself how to get out of it
And balance it with talents, wit
'Cause life is like a penny (Life is like a penny)
'Cause it's only one percent
Who overcome the shit they've underwent
I went AWOL like what my back was up against
Don't tell me 'bout struggle, bitch, I lived it
I was five or six the first time I got my hind end kicked
Malcolm, Isaac, and Boogie jumped me and took my tricycle
And I don't know if I would call that white privilege, yeah
But I get it, how it feels to be judged by pigment
Besides getting it from both sides of the tracks
But I swore I'd get them back
Even if it meant selling my soul to get my revenge and (What?)
Thought of a scheme and it got me to thinking
If I can believe in myself, I could prolly achieve it
That’s part of the reason I do all my talking with ink
And as long as I'm breathing, I vow to smother and beat them
My god, what a heart of a demon, go at 'em and I'ma get even
Like I'm in the Garden of Eden, I'm 'bout to go off of the deep end
This evil is calling, I'm already seething and

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm leaving Heaven
I'm leaving Heaven
Angels won't find me
Where I am going

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Okay, so while Macklemore was keeping his room nice and neat (Yeah)
I was getting my ass beat twice a week (What?)
Looking for a place for the night where I could sleep (Yeah)
Flippin' sofa cushions over just tryin' to see
If I could find some change and scrape up for a bite to eat
If Denaun and me find a couple dimes a piece
Twenty five cents each'd get us a bag of chips
We'd be glad to get that even we if we had to split
We'd do backward flips, looking back at it
I think that would fit with the definition of not having shit
Couple that with the fact my mother was batshit
Pop was a sack of shit, yeah, he died, but I gave half a shit
Yeah, which brings me back to the dear 'ol dad that I zero had
Since a year-old, forty-seven year-old scab
Just to hear them words, ear piercing
Like my earlobe stabbed with a needle for an earring
Should I feel upset? You were dead to me 'fore you died
Me? Tear no shed
Should I have made a mural at your funeral?
Had your coffin draped with a hero's flag?
Where the fuck you were at
When De'Angelo done hurt me real bad at the Rio Grande?
Never met your grandkids, fucking coward
Only guts you had was from your stomach fat
I couldn't see your ass goin' to Heaven
So I'm asking for a pass to go to Hell
So I can whip your fucking ass
I hate that I'll never get to say ""I hate you"" to your face
No coming back from where I'm going
Sky is dark, my soul is black, hand on the shovel
Dig with the blade of it then I step on the metal
Vendetta to settle, tell the Devil

[Chorus: Skylar Grey & Eminem]
I'm leaving Heaven (Yeah)
I'm leaving Heaven (You know, I should dig your motherfucking ass up)
Angels won't find me (Just to spit in your fucking face)
Where I am going (Holding my baby pictures up like you're proud of me)
I'm leaving heaven (Fuck you, bitch)
I'm leaving heaven (You know what? Maybe if I had had you)
Angels won't find me (I wouldn't have went through half the shit I went through, so I blame you)
Where I am going (Or maybe I should say, ""Thank you"")
('Cause I wouldn't have been me, haha)

[Outro: Skylar Grey & Eminem]

Cause I've had the time of my life
And I owe it all to you

[Verse 1:]
I've been waiting for so long
Now I've finally found someone to stand by me
We saw the writing on the wall
As we felt this magical fantasy

Now with passion in our eyes
There's no way we could disguise it secretly
So we take each other's hand
Cause we seem to understand the urgency

[Pre-Chorus:]
Just remember
You're the one thing
I can't get enough of
So I'll tell you something
This could be love
Because

Go girl, a go girl
A top notch thoroughbred, pro girl

An all night putting on a show girl
She go live, she go silly
If I tell her bring it back, she'll go-go get it

I got this girl that’s on so sadiddy
She call and say she miss me
I tell her I’ma visit next time I’m in her city
I turn your world to Gotti World, shorty bring your ticket
Jimmy Choo and Red Bottoms, shorty we can kick it
I take her on trips, her boyfriend be tripping
Text her phone a million times, but she ain’t trying to hear it
Tattoos and piercings, Gucci shoes for chirren
Kids just as fresh as she be, She serious
All I do is ball, and all she fuck is winners
Take her to the mall, she don’t want to go to dinner
She a go girl, and I’m trying to get with her
Have you looking right, I had to follow her on Twitter
She’s a go girl

[Hook]

[Verse Two – Wiz Khalifa]
Go, go, keep on going
I be somewhere throwing money, blowing on that potent
Money in my bank account, pockets hella swollen
And a model girlfriend, so for them cameras we be posing
We just go–go anywhere we wanna
Got a weed connect from Tennessee to California
Twenty grand in Pari, blowing on that Mary
Your bitch on my Johnson cause I’m balling like I’m Larry
And I play my part
I’m out here with them bosses, and she notice from the start
Get thirty K to show, so we both be going hard
Don’t smoke or roll the weed up
If she broke she get her cheese up
Ever slow, she’ll up the speed
Cause she a go girl

[Verse Three – Big Sean]
OK now whoa there, keep going, throwing
That big booty, dong in

I swear that pussy so good, I wish I could clone it
Go girl, go girl
My new bitch, your old girl
She bust it open for my like a showgirl
Call me king, then tell me that it’s your world
Body Jamaican, but the vagina is Asian
I swear that’s hourglass shape and
That reminds me time wasting
Fuck around, I might taste it
And if I throw it back at her, then she probably gonna chase it
Because she’s a go girl

Back in '84 I swore
To peel straight dimes, no more twos or fours
Not looking for ""My Cherie Amour""
I'm a mack, I pimp whores, got CD's in stores
I'm hardcore like the almighty Thor
Campaign with this game man, like Al Gore
Drink Mickey's not Coors, no sticky pot wars
Got wounds and sores, boy I been through wars
I want to party until I fall to the floor
Get drunk, pass out, then snore
Mrs. bartender come pour me some more
What no more? Fuck you, up yours!
I'm into whores that wear Christian Dior
No pimples or clogged up pores
I don't bark, I roar, catch me on tour
In a velour, ho's screaming for more
Fuck it, you want me to come with some more whores?
Or cutthroat up and take this shit outdoors?

Get with ya? I'd rather have fun

You should've know that word, 'bout what you did with her

I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?""
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

You can see that I've been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?

Was she worth this?

Just came back in the middle of the may
In the Maybach with this chick named May
Wanna know if she can do me, Shawty yes you may
See the whole rap game sounded like me
Put that on the drums but it sounded like P
Shawty say she horny, sound like me
Say she wanna bring her partner, okay that sound like 3
Fresh off the yacht, feet in the sand
Walk in the club, me in demand
Got a whip on the lot, 'bout 400 grand
Gold 'round my neck, pistol close at hand 'cause

And you know it don't stop
Grindin round that clock
Masterminding my second album
My first album just dropped
Scored a touchdown on my first down
Niggas thought I was gon' flop
See I hustle like my momma but I look just like my pops
And we still duckin cops
Ride around and take shots
Hennessy for my enemies
Niggas know I'm takin they spot
Cause that score up on the play clock
Show just how I came from way back
Just like T-I-P told you ASAP but you niggas rappin like Aesop, Aesop
Get a grip
Oh that's your dream car? Nigga that's my old whip
Oh that's your dream girl? Nigga that's my old bitch
Oh that's your new flow? Nigga that's my old shit!
This that new KRIT shit, that Cole shit, them country niggas

[Hook: Cole]
One for the money, two for the show
Three for them hoes saying anything goes
They say they ready for whatever!
They say they ready for whatever
I been around the world, twice to be exact
Six bad bitches and they lapped up in the back
They say they ready for whatever!
They say they ready for whatever!

[Verse 2: Jiaer Lavon]
1 for my mother
2 for my bros
The rest for Jiaer Lavon, Ain't gonna leave none of this ish for none of these hoes
One day I'll inherit the throne
Boy eff a shine, I'm gonna glow
I follow my dreams, you wanna hang with me but forget it cuz I ain't no rope
These niggas retired, they flow-less
I'm only inspired by dope shit
The rest of these niggas is clones
This shit is dire, require mitosis
I told my mom I was gon blow back in 06
But back in 04, told my momma we'll never be poor
That's when I picked my pride from  
The floor
Thats when I took my focus from these hoes, 
Back in 03, giving my dad my albums, making him pass out CDs
Master minding my scheme, Uhn
Living life off them streets, Uhn
But know what the crazy thing is? I was still pissing in my sheets, Uhn
Morning bacon & eggs, bitch
Was only in the 3rd grade, bitch
Putting my business out there now I'm 17 years old & never been laid, huh
Cuz I been focused on this music. 
Sit back & witness what I do with it
Now if that's yo new flow? It must be my old ISH
If that's ya new ho, it must be my old B**ch!

We killed the track &now we're touring ""Cross Country""...

One for the money, two for the show
Three for No Limit and the rest for Death Row
That means I been bout it bout it and this is the realist shit I ever wrote
And if anyone ever doubt it then they are the loudest of liars I know
I only desire to blow, she only desire to blow
And I hope that my dick is a whistlely flute, and that's not the instrumental
Now pick up my coat
You let that motherfucker drag like RuPaul, I'll drag your ass to the floor
Bitch, I can admit, I'm a recovered addict, paraphernalia that is
Telling the doctor I'm sick, head doctor I'm needing your lips, yea
Proper analogy for it, if I can afford it then I won't ignore it
Cop me a palace and Porsche and right when I floor it that's when I switch gears
Living my life on Uranus, uh, keeping one foot in your anus, uh
The other foot all on your neck, repeatedly stomp 'til I break it, uh
Bitch I'm demanding respect, these bitches is telling me take it

I'ma need a coupe, I won't need a roof
Flyer than Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice
I got the flow, I'm tryin' to see the roof
Didn't wear a bulletproof so I got shot and you can see the proof
Blind eyes could look at me and see the truth
Wonder if Stevie do?
But I'ma leave it to God, not Beaver, neither you
Cause I'ma murder Y, kill O, and even U
Man, I got Summer hatin' on me cause I'm hotter than the sun
Got Spring hatin' on me 'cause I ain't never sprung
Winter hatin' on me 'cause I'm colder than y'all

And when they snooze, we up!
Feet up, like a paraplegia
Or paraplegic? I parallel park
In that red-and-yellow thing; old school Atlanta Hawk
Like I'm from College Park, but I'm from Hollygrove
Now all my Bloods scream ""Soo-woo"" and ""Da-da-doe""

And I weigh it well, on my Libra scale

The Biggies and the Pacs and the Marleys and the Marcuses
Garvey; got me a molotov-cocktail flow
Even if you box well, can't stop the blows
Kaboom! The Roc Boy in the room
The dope boy I just came off the spoon
Also, I'm so fly I'm on auto-
Pilot, while guys just stare at my wardrobe
I see Euros, that's right: plural
I took so much change from this rap game, it's your go
(Hey Mr. Carter) Young!

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
It's my go, yeah… And I'ma go so opposite of soft
Off the richter, Hector, Camacho Man, Randy Savage
Far from average, above status–quo, flow so pro
I know, I ride slow, and when I pass
They say, ""What up, killa?"" Man, stop bringin' up my past
And next time you mention Pac, Biggie, or Jay-Z
Don't forget Weezy, Baby!

And I swear to everything, when I leave this Earth
It's gonna be on both feet, never knees in the dirt
And you can try me, fucker, but when I squeeze, it hurt

I write all my lyrics in your skin with a pocket knife
I'm not locked in fights but god, I might
Just rock your cypher, tear it to shreds
Like it's paper, even when I play fair, I'm the best
Of the next generation, just another humble kid
Who pulls fresh punchlines out of his arse; that's some funny shit
Straight from the rubbish tip, full of lip like herpes
I wanna rush my life so I'll skip my thirties
And win my earnings of no more than a couple hundred bucks
And go straight to retirement in a couple months
I'll sucker punch your crew like Andrew Gaff on Brayshaw
Ripping pub rock, make fans of mumble rappers hate more
'Specially when you find out this ain't my own shit, no way
I just took an old tape and re-released it on my own name

Holler back at the horrible, hellish horror point
Explosive [?] corrosive hardest rapper on the joint

Attack of the innermost enemy, it's an emergency [?] haven't you heard
Listen, I'm the voice in your mind that says I'm doin' fine
Thundercloud [?] but still I'm doin' fine
So when the bell toils, who you gonna call?
When the bell toils, who you gonna call?
Who you gonna call right before you fall? Writings on the wall, highly probable
Got you lose it all (Got you lose it all)
Take a look inside, measure your device
[?]
And when the storm rows in and the herd grows thin
Hear the sound of that thunder clap
It's a sign of the times, keep your eyes on the prize
Way up high in the sky and just holler back!

[Verse 3: DJ Spuddzz]
I had a clever stage name initially like Emkew
Seecie was the name, you know that shit don't need a test tube
I mix my green and red, blue, I think I need my head screwed
On properly, now I think I'm Cee Lo Green, forget you
I'm set to become the wackest rapper that you'll ever know
Never broke, make millions from rapping on a metronome
Have a sexy flow so I don't need good production
You just seem good, you're nothin', me, I'm heaps good like Muphin
You might have some balls and a dick but it still doesn't click
What you're fuckin' with isn't real, it's just a myth
I love the lip from the haters, bagging no name rappers out
Desperate for attention so they change their style from trap to house
And rap about whatever's trendy, me, I keep it real
Bring the future by spitting raps that heaps of people feel
I'll be going strong for years while there's heaps of beats to steal
Complain about it if you will, I'll make the weaker people kneel
Yes, I make my own beats, some are played in low key
Aging slowly but still forget to shave my goatee
I don't need to brag, I just know I'm better than you
I've come to tell you 'bout your future; Ebenezer Scrooge
I'm the only rap you need for the present and the future
Got an album in the making, later better than sooner
But if you need bars, who you gonna call?
Look in ten years, whose poster's on your wall?

198,Here I Am,"[Verse 1]
Why is it that you could only see the worst in me?
I swear sometimes it feel like it nurtures me
But to keep it all real, it's kinda hurtin' me
I could say I'm done with it, but it lurks in me
So I'mma just tell myself that it works for me
Take a real long drive in the Mercedes
And I might pop a couple of them Percocets
Yeah, that'll make me transform to Hercules

[Hook 1]
I am who I am, uh!
Here I am, here I am, so take me, as I am
Here I am, here I am, so take me, as I am
Here I am, here I am, so take me, as I am
I am who I am, uh!

[Verse 2]
I swear to God man, everything in life is old
And the only thing that changed is the price of gold
Even in the afterlife I'ma fight your soul
'Cause the second time around I'll be twice as bold
So do you take me to be who I am?
To have and to hold till death do us part?
'Cause if not, it's just best we both part
'Cause how am I supposed finish what you start?
You got me thinkin' twice to just breathe
Then you say I won't survive if I leave
But I got a couple of tricks up my sleeve
I no longer need your attention, at ease

[Hook 2]
It's a joke, it's a game, why am I still keeping score?
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed, I'm a woman, hear me roar

I can't decide
You have made it harder just to go on
And why? All the possibilities
Well, I was wrong

That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating
And that's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa

[Verse 2]
I wonder
How am I supposed to feel when you're not here?
Cause I burned every bridge I ever built when you were here
I still try holding onto silly things, I never learn
Oh, why?
All the possibilities
I'm sure you've heard

[Chorus 1]
That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating
And that's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa

Pain, make your way to me, to me
And I'll always be just so inviting
If I ever start to think straight
This heart will start a riot in me
Let's start, start, hey!

Oh, why do we like to hurt so much?

My name ring bells, bitch buzz me in (BZZZZ!)
And I only stop for pedestrians (Oh!)
Or a real, real bad lesbian
Hit 'em with the MAC, hit 'em with the TEC-nine
Hit 'em with the Ruger, by the intersect sign
Hit 'em with a Tommy, so my niggas call me Pammy
And I always keep the jammy
In the trunk or in the Lam-y (O-WAH!)
Put my whole borough on my back and I'm good-uh
I don't wanna hear what you would, what you could-uh
I represent all the girls that stood up (Unh!)
Used to drink water with a little bit of sugar (Oh)
Now I'm in the gym with my squats and my sit-ups (One, two!"")

And I'm telling President Carter, he picked a winner,bitches like Nelly and Kelly, got a dilemma
These birds all fly south, in the winter

209,If I Never See Your Face Again,"[Verse 1]
Now as the summer fades, I let you slip away
You say I'm not your type, but I can make you sway
It makes you burn to learn you're not the only one
I'd let you be if you put down your blazing gun

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you've gone somewhere else far away
I don't know if I will find you (Find you, find you)
But you feel my breath on your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you (Right behind you)

And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight

Sometimes you move so well, it's hard not to give in
I'm lost, I can't tell where you end and I begin
It makes me burn to learn you're with another man
I wonder if he's half the lover that I am

I don't know if I will find you (Find you, find you)
But you feel my breath on your neck

Yo. Lil girls in the city. Dress up pretty
Go out and get messed up and shitty

Girls in the hills, go day trippin. To get their nails done, and hair straighten
Lil girls in the 818. Get hot when I roll over laurel canyon

[Verse 1]
I probably shouldn't say this
But at times, I get so scared
When I think about the previous
Relationship we've shared
It was awesome, but we lost it
It's not possible for me not to care
And now we're standing in the rain
But nothing's ever gonna change until you hear, my dear

[Chorus]
The seven things I hate about you
The seven things I hate about you, oh, you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks
When you act like them, just know, it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

[Verse 2]
It's awkward and silent as I wait for you to say
But what I need to hear now, your sincere apology
When you mean it, I'll believe it
If you text it, I'll delete it
Let's be clear (Clear, clear)
Oh, I'm not coming back
You're taking seven steps here

The seven things I hate about you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure

I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

And compared to all the great things
That would take too long to write
I probably should mention the seven that I like

The seven things I like about you
Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's
When we kiss, I'm hypnotized
You make me laugh, you make me cry
But I guess that's both I'll have to buy
Your hand in mine
When we're intertwined, everything's alright
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I like the most that you do
You make me love you

I got depressed and I never got better
You ain't on my level
Don't be pushing me, pressing me
I got a Big Mac and it's next to me
And I got a fat bitch on the ecstasy
On top of the bread like a sesame
They want the recipe for success
And now they after me 'cause I got a masterpiece
Used to, used to laugh at me and now they gassin' me, dappin' me

I think I'm next up in the 27 Club
I've been too fucked up, serotonin 'bout done
Every night been ending with me biting on my gun
I know you say you love me but you make me wanna jump
Off of the ledge
I'm eleven stories up and thinking about how my mother would feel if I jumped
But now it's not enough for me to stop, how I feel about ending it all, I'ma jump (Jump)

Wish they could just wish me away that what they really want

""We'll do a song together maybe then we can beat him""
Somehow he must be stopped, something must be done
""If we can't knock him off, let's just try him when he get caught with guns""
""And if he really done, and we really won""
""Any more ideas, (I got some) suggestions anyone?""
""How 'bout we stay up all night, on the blog sites""
""Spread, vicious lies and nasty rumors we could all write""

Like the biggest Louis bags, the Bentley and newest Jags
And the huge pad and make you laugh when you be mad
Just invite your friends over for diner and you can brag
Chanel and Tiffany this, Versace and Gucci that
Lifestyle like that, if you leave you'll be back
Everywhere you could go, they either broke or pretty whack
Plus you ain't gotta ask where my heart really at
But you wanna waste time with one of them silly cats
Go and be my guest, though I don't suggest
It's just so hard to get love like this (oh oh)

225,Gunpowder And Lead,"[Verse 1]
County road two thirty-three under my feet
Nothin' on this white rock but little ol' me
I've got two miles till he makes bail
And if I'm right, we're headed straight for hell

[Chorus]
I'm goin' home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door, and light a cigarette
He wants a fight, well, now he's got one
He ain't seen me crazy yet
Slapped my face, and he shook me like a rag doll
Don't that sound like a real man?
I'm gonna show him what little girls are made of
Gunpowder and lead

[Verse 2]
Well, it's half past ten, another six-pack in
And I can feel the rumble like the cold black wind
He pulls in the drive, the gravel flies
But he don't know what's waiting here this time

[Chorus]
I'm goin' home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door, and light a cigarette
He wants a fight, well, now he's got one
He ain't seen me crazy yet
Slapped my face, and he shook me like a rag doll
Don't that sound like a real man?
I'm gonna show him what little girls are made of
Gunpowder and lead

His fist is big, but my gun's bigger
He'll find out when I pull the trigger

[Chorus]
I'm goin' home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door, and light a cigarette
He wants a fight, well, now he's got one
He ain't seen me crazy yet
Slapped my face, and he shook me like a rag doll
Don't that sound like a real man?
I'm gonna show him what little girls are made of

I'm goin' home, gonna load my shotgun

226,Believe,"[Verse 1]
And I started from the bottom
Like a snowman—ground-up
Like round chuck, and still put hands on you
Stayin' wound up is how I spend time (Get it?)
Sucker free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes
I just got that air about me like wind chimes (Yeah)
'Nother day in the life (Uh)
Used to have to scrape to get by (Yeah)
Now my community's gated and I
Made it and my neighbors say hi (Say hi)
I'm givin' 'em pounds, I'm upscale now
Guess it means I'm way in the sky (Way in the sky)
But I still remember the days of
Minimum wage for general labor
Welfare recipient since a minor
Look how government assistance has made ya!
Adversity, if at first you don't succeed
Put your temper to more use
'Cause bein' broke's a poor excuse
That should only give you more fuel
Show 'em why you're you
So close, God, it's like I almost got it
But close only counts in time bombs and horseshoes
So I Unabomb shit—tick, tick, tick—no remorse, pew!
Screw it, I'm lit, and that attitude I blew up on quick
That's why they call me firecracker
I grew up on WIC—wick, wick, wick—with a short fuse
I got some important news to report to
Anyone who thought I was done: nah bitch, not quite
Spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours?

[Chorus]
Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

[Verse 2]
Man, I know sometimes
These thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice
To me they're just ink blots
I just fling 'em like slingshots and so precise
So you might wanna think it over twice (Yeah)
Or you retards can roll the dice
But beef will at least cost you your career
'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced
But this middle finger's free as a bird
Nuke warhead at birth, hugest forehead on Earth
Too short for the verse, studied his formula, learned
How to incorporate a curse
Point it towards corporate America
Stick a fork in and turn
'Cause four-letter words are more better heard
The world force-fed a turd to me, you're getting yours
But sometimes I overdo it, but I just get so into it
I was there consolin' you when no one knew it
When your situation showed no improvement
I was that door, you walked over to it
I'm the light at the end of the tunnel
So people are always lookin' to me as they're goin' through it
When that tunnel vision is unclear
Shit becomes too much to bear
Since ""Cleanin' Out My Closet""
When I was havin' trouble with the snare
I'm that unrealistic prayer answered
And I'ma get you jacked up like you're tryna fix a flat, uh
When you struggle with despair
That double-fisted, bare-knuckles coupled with this pair
Of nuts I'm cuppin', I am your 'fuck it' switch, nothin' can compare

[Chorus]
Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

[Verse 3]
Started from the bottom like a snowman
Oh man, put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that
But my battery's low, I'ma need a boost to my pack
And I know that I always got Proof at my back
I called you ""Proof"" because I knew for a fact
My ace in the hole, homie, I'm callin' on you
'Cause I think I'm slowly startin' to lose faith in it, so
Give me that inkling and mo–
–tivation to go, Hussein with the flow
Fake fans that are two-faced didn't show
Let heartbeats loop, produce hate in my soul
Layin' vocals two days in a row
True statement, hate to go down this road
But there's only one route to cross this bridge
So I walk in this bitch with loose change
'Cause all my dues paid, but this booth's takin' its toll
But it's never too late to start a new beginnin'
That goes for you too, so what the fuck you gon' do?
Use the tools you're given!
Or you're gon' use the cards you're dealt
As an excuse for you to not do shit with 'em?
I used to play the loser/victim
'Til I saw the way Proof was driven
I found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet
And when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets
Fanny packs, hourglasses
If time was on my side, I'd still have none to waste
Man, in my younger days
That dream was so much fun to chase
It's like I'd run in place
While this shit dangled in front of my face
But how do you keep up the pace
And the hunger pangs once you've won the race?
When that dual exhaust is coolin' off
'Cause you don't got nothin' left to prove at all
'Cause you done already hit 'em with the coup de grâce
Still you feel the need to go full tilt
That Bruce Willis, that Blue Steel, that true skill
When that wheel's loose, I won't lose will

227,Change,"[Intro: J. Cole]
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days, yeah
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I like this tone

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, my intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I sit in silence and find whenever I meditate
My fears alleviate, my tears evaporate
My faith don't deviate, ideas don't have a date
But see I'm growing and getting stronger with every breath
Bringing me closer to Heaven's doors with every step
As we speak I'm at peace, no longer scared to die
Most niggas don't believe in God and so they terrified
It's either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell
Asking the Father for forgiveness, got 'em overwhelmed (Please, God, I want to go to Heaven)
As if He's spiteful like them white folks that control the jail
See I believe if God is real, He'd never judge a man
Because He knows us all and therefore He would understand
The ignorance that make a nigga take his brother life
The bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife

[Chorus: J. Cole]
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Yeah, my chosen religion
Jesus piece frozen from sinnin'
Doin' dirt, hoping to God, He know my intentions
To see a million 'fore I see a casket
I got a baby on the way, know he gon' be a bastard
I'm living fast like I'm in a drag race, how that cash taste
When I was a senior, I was ballin' on my classmates
Niggas put three bullets in my car, one hit the gas tank
Know I got a angel cause I'm supposed to have a halo
Right now, my lifestyle destined for a federal facility
For my ability to make them birds fly
Fiends wanna get higher than a bird's eye view
And who am I to tell a nigga what to do?
I just supply, it's economics
My business ain't got the suit and tie
Keep a pistol at all times, niggas want what's mine
I can't oblige, dog, I work too hard
So reach for it, get referred to God, I'm going hard, nigga

[Chorus: J. Cole]
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from—

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Yeah, prodigal son, got a new gun
This one don't run out of ammo
Lately been working on my handles
Can I ball, become a star and remain my self?
If I fall, dust it off and regain my self
Fuck 'em all, they don't know all the pain I felt
I'm in awe, after all the fame I felt, I evolved
I no longer bury demons, I be a vessel for the truth until I'm barely breathing, I'm singing

[Bridge: Ari Lennox & J. Cole]
Life is all about the evolution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
You can dream but don't neglect the execution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Time is short that's what somebody told me
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Too short to keep following your homies
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more

[Bridge: J. Cole]
I reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands
All of a sudden niggas pop a trunk and then we scram
Finger on trigger make a little nigga understand
What it's like to finally be the motherfuckin' man
Eyes wide that's from the power that the coward feels
Niggas die over bitches, disrespect, and dollar bills
Bloodshed that turned the city to a battlefield
I call it poison, you call it real (pop, pop, pop, pop)
That's how you feel?

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
Pistols be poppin' and niggas drop in a heartbeat
Scattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete
A body laid on the concrete
Look, somebody laid on the concrete
No time for that, ain't no lookin' back, cause I'm running too
I made it home, I woke up and turned on the morning news
Overcame with a feeling I can't explain
Cause that was my nigga James that was slain, he was 22
(Last night at around...) He was 22
(22 year old black male, suspect, reporting live...)

[Outro: J. Cole]
(I swear to God, bruh)
We're gathered here today...
(I swear to God)
To mourn the life of James McMillan Jr
(I swear to God—nigga, I'ma kill them niggas, man)
A tragedy, another tragedy in the black community
(I promise you, bro...)
We got to do better, people
22 years old, this boy was too young
(I promise you, bro, I'ma kill them niggas, yo...)
Our condolences go to his family, our prayers
(I'ma kill them niggas myself...)
We know he's in a better place
We know he's in a better place
But this has got to end, ladies and gentleman
We've got to come together, this is—this is beyond words
Now I'd like to open this ceremony with a verse from—",J. Cole,2008,"[100, 39, 10]",3

I can tell you about Leif Ericson
I know all the words to ""De Colores""
And I'm proud to be an American
Me and my friends saw a platypus
Me and my friend made a comic book
And guess how long it took?
I can do anything that I want 'cause look—

[Chorus 1]
I can keep rhythm with no metronome
No metronome, no metronome
And I can see your face on the telephone
On the telephone, on the telephone

[Verse 2]
Look at me, look at me
Just called to say that it's good to be
Alive, in such a small world
I'm all curled up with a book to read
I can make money, open up a thrift store
I can make a living off a magazine
I can design an engine sixty-four miles to a gallon of gasoline
I can make new antibiotics
I can make computers survive aquatic conditions
I know how to run a business
And I can make you wanna buy a product
Movers, shakers, and producers
Me and my friends understand the future
I see the strings that control the systems
I can do anything with no resistance 'cause—

[Chorus 2]
I can lead a nation with a microphone
With a microphone, with a microphone
And I can split the atom of a molecule
Of a molecule, of a molecule

[Trumpet Solo]​

[Verse 3]
Look at me, look at me, driving and I won't stop
And it feels so good to be alive and on top
My reach is global, my tower secure
My cause is noble, my power is pure
I can hand out a million vaccinations
Or let 'em all die in exasperation
Have 'em all healed from their lacerations
Or have 'em all killed by assassination
I can make anybody go to prison
Just because I don't like 'em
And I can do anything with no permission
I have it all under my command because—

[Chorus 3]
I can guide a missile by satellite
By satellite, by satellite
And I can hit a target through a telescope
Through a telescope, through a telescope
And I can end the planet in a holocaust (Ah!)
In a holocaust (Ah!)
In a holocaust (Ah!)
In a holocaust (Ah!)
In a holocaust (Ah!)
In a holocaust (Ah!)
(Ah!)

Hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie, even if they tell
Sweet lullabies that come with a smell
Of a dozen roses flipping down the green hill
You're living in a world that come with plan B
Cause plan A never relay a guarantee
And plan C never could say just what it was
And your plans only can pan around love
You love him, you love them, you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love red bottom and gold that say ""Queen""
You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean
You love French tip and trip that pay for
You love bank slip that tell you we paid more
You love a good hand whenever the card dealt
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, (cause before you know it, everything's gone)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie, even if they fell
Out the sky and your optics turn stale
Where they mold that's green, I can see you fit the bill
Of living in a world that come with plan B
Cause plan A only can make another mistake
And you can't see success coming from plan C
When it all breaks, you'll still say you're lovely
And love them and love when you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love fast cars and dead presidents old
You love fast women, you love keepin' control
Of everything that you love, you love beef
You love streets, you love running, ducking police
You love your hood, might even love it to death
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real (cause before you know it, everything's gone)

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
The reason why I know you very well
Cause we have the same eyes, can't you tell?
The days I tried to cover up and conceal
My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal
When living in a world that come with plan B
A scapegoat cause plan A don't come free
And plan C just an excuse like ""because""
Or the word ""but,"" but what if I got love?
I love them, I love when I love her
I love so much, I love when love hurts
I love first verse ’cause you're the girl I attract
I love second verse ’cause you're the homie that pack
Burner like a stove top, that love cooking from scratch
I love what the both of you have to offer
In fact, I love it so much, I don't love anything else
But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself
To the point I should hate everything I do love?
Should I hate living my life inside the club?
Should I hate her for watching me for that reason?
Should I hate him for telling me that I'm seizin'?
Should I hate them for telling me ""ball out""?
Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about
Hating all money, power, respect in my will
Or hating the fact none of that shit make me real?

But when you do make it, give back with your words of encouragement, and that's the best way to give back. To your city...

241,Warrior,"[Verse 1]
This is a story that I have never told
I gotta get this off my chest to let it go
I need to take back the light inside you stole
You're a criminal, and you steal like you're a pro

[Pre-Chorus 1]
All the pain and the truth
I wear like a battle wound
So ashamed, so confused
I was broken and bruised

[Chorus]
Now I'm a warrior, now I've got thicker skin
I'm a warrior, I'm stronger than I've ever been
And my armor is made of steel, you can't get in
I'm a warrior, and you can never hurt me again

[Verse 2]
Out of the ashes, I'm burning like a fire
You can save your apologies, you're nothing but a liar
I've got shame, I've got scars, that I will never show
I'm a survivor, in more ways than you know

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause all the pain and the truth
I wear like a battle wound
So ashamed, so confused
I'm not broken or bruised

'Cause now I'm a warrior, now I've got thicker skin

And my armor is made of steel, you can't get in
I'm a warrior, and you can never hurt me

[Bridge]
There's a part of me I can't get back
A little girl grew up too fast
All it took was once, I'll never be the same
Now I'm taking back my life today
Nothing left that you can say
'Cause you were never gonna take the blame anyway

[Chorus]
Now I'm a warrior, I've got thicker skin
I'm a warrior, I'm stronger than I've ever been
And my armor is made of steel, you can't get in
I'm a warrior, and you can never hurt me again

Now the hoes done shown up, the money done blown up
But every time you callin' a nigga, I pick the phone up
Don't care about my pockets being swole up
Long as I show love, show up, my top won't go up
Everyday's a new flight, at night's a new hotel
Fuck you on plane, it don't matter girl I won't tell
Both feet in the sand, you know I'm the man
We gone stick to the plan, watch 'em shit on demand
Early morning eatin' breakfast in the hot tub
Pedicure, Manny, full massage with the face scrub
Smokin' OG, fuck the police
Sun glowin' off your skin
Said she never been there before, she tryna do it again
I can't only fuck once, I'm tryna do it again

246,Damaged,"[Intro: Bmike]
I've been, I've been through a lot of crazy things in my life and somehow you're always there to, always there to pick up the pieces and accept me for who I am
So listen

[Verse 1: Bmike]
I never meant for you to deal with all this pressure
Or for you to deal with all this pain that don't belong to you
You carry all my burdens from my past on a stretcher
So the very least that I can do is write this song for you
Baby you don't have to choose to stay but yet you do it anyway
And for a moment I get glimpses of what's in the heavens gates
You show me beauty in the rain, even smiling when it's pouring
The creases on the corners of my lips still feel so foreign to my senses
I sense that you might leave me in an instant
You don't, it's just my insecurities are up to mischief
You reassure me, you show me love and then it cures me
Not with words because the actions of your promise does it for me
It's lovely, I'm used to feeling cold that's below zero sub ze-ro beneath my mind that if I wish I could not unsee
It's crazy, I know the baggage in my trunk is ugly but you still choose to love me

[Chorus: Bmike]
How can you love someone so damaged?
Feel it in my palms, feeling so beyond
You don't know how to respond
Everyday this thing gets harder to manage
Been there from the start
Even when you saw the black that's covering my heart
I showed you scars that are deeper than what you have known
And you tell me I've never looked more beautiful
So I'm sorry that I'm damaged
I'm sorry for the pain
I'm sorry that you probably have to deal with it again

[Verse 2: JayteKz]
I said I'm sorry for the pain but I can't help this shit, I wish you never felt this shit
Promise you're my angel but I'mma probably go to hell for this
Mentally I am sick and I don't choose to break your fucking heart
My life's a tragic flick and I ain't choose to play this part
I'll take apart my heart and let you find the missing pieces
It's lost inside the dark and being consumed by all my demons
I slowly weaken, my wounds and cuts they only deepen
And while you heal me you become a victim of mistreatment
I'm fucking sorry, the traces of my past just taunt me
The future's daunting when the present feels so damn disheartening
How could you want me?
You found me right when I had lost me
You hold me tight through all the fights although it's so exhausting
And it's so lovely, you never let the pressure crush me
I made you feel so low while you put no one else above me
I know the baggage in my trunk is ugly and yet you still choose to love me

[Chorus: Bmike]
How can you love someone so damaged?
Feel it in my palms, feeling so beyond
You don't know I am respawned
Everyday this thing gets harder to manage
Been there from the start
Even when you saw the black that's covering my heart
I showed you scars that are deeper than what you have known
And you tell me I've never looked more beautiful
So I'm sorry that I'm damaged
I'm sorry for the pain
I'm sorry that you probably have to deal with it again

We keep behind closed doors
Every time I see you, I die a little more
Stolen moments that we steal as the curtain falls

250,What If It All Goes Right,"What if that road that you're taking's a dead end?
What if love leaves you all jaded and broken?
What if that limb breaks you're climbing out on?
Yeah, what if it all goes wrong?

But, what if it all goes right?
What if it all works out?
What if the stars line up and good luck rains down?
What if you chase your dreams and it changes your whole life?
Yeah, what if it all goes right?

What if that road is a beautiful slow drive?
What if that love ends up lasting a lifetime?
What if that limb holds you oak tree strong?
What if this time nothing goes wrong?

But, what if it all goes right?
What if it all works out?
What if the stars line up and good luck rains down?
What if you chase your dreams and it changes your whole life?
Yeah, what if it all goes right?

What if you climb to the mountain top and touch the sky?
Grab a cloud as it passes by?
You might fall you might fall
But then again you might fly

What if it all goes right?
What if it all works out?
What if the stars line up and good luck rains down?
What if you chase your dreams and it changes your whole life?
Yeah, what if it all goes right?",Melissa Lawson,2008,[79],1
251,Summertime,"[Intro]
Drums Please!

[Hook]
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

[Verse 1]
Here it is the groove slightly transformed
Just a bit of a break from the norm
Just a little somethin' to break the monotony
Of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be
A little bit out of control it's cool to dance
But what about the groove that soothes that moves romance
Give me a soft subtle mix
And if ain't broke then don't try to fix it
And think of the summers of the past
Adjust the bass and let the Alpine blast
Pop in my CD and let me run a rhyme
And put your car on cruise and lay back 'cause this is summertime

[Hook]
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

[Verse 2]
School is out and it's a sort of a buzz
But back then I didn't really know what it was
But now I see what have of this
The way that people respond to summer madness
The weather is hot and girls are dressin' less
And checkin' out the fellas to tell 'em who's best
Riding around in your Jeep or your Benzos
Or in your Nissan sittin' on Lorenzos
Back in Philly we be out in the park
A place called the Plateau is where everybody goes
Guys out huntin' and girls doin' likewise
Honkin' at the honey in front of you with the light eyes
She turn around to see what you beepin' at
It's like the summer's a natural aphrodisiac
And with a pen and pad I compose this rhyme
To hip you and to get you equipped for the summertime

[Hook]
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

[Verse 3]
It's late in the day and I ain't been on the court yet
Hustle to the mall to get me a short set
Yeah I got on sneaks but I need a new pair
Cause basketball courts in the summer got girls there
The temperature's about 88
Hop in the water plug just for old times sake
Break to ya crib change your clothes once more
Cause you're invited to a barbecue that's startin' at 4
Sittin' with your friends cause y'all reminisce
About the days growin' up and the first person you kiss
And as I think back makes me wonder how
The smell from a grill could spark up nostalgia
All the kids playin' out front
Little boys messin' round with the girls playing double-dutch
While the DJ's spinnin' a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion
Then six o'clock rolls around
You just finished wipin' your car down
It's time to cruise so you go to the summertime hangout
It looks like a car show
Everybody come lookin' real fine
Fresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon
Every moment frontin' and maxin'
Chillin' in the car they spent all day waxin'
Leanin' to the side but you can't speed through
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
There's an air of love and of happiness
And this is the Fresh Prince's new definition of summer madness

You'd hate for the kids to think that you lost your cool

[Chorus]
I'ma do the things that I wanna do
I ain't got a thing to prove to you
I'll eat my candy with the pork and beans
Excuse my manners if I make a scene

I'm fine and dandy with the me inside
One look in the mirror and I'm tickled pink
I don't give a hoot about what you think

[Verse 2]
Everyone likes to dance to a happy song
With a catchy chorus and beat so they can sing along
Timbaland knows the way to reach the top of the charts
Maybe if I work with him, I can perfect the art

I pass you a joint, better pass it back
I went to Montgomery, with packs on back
Sent her to the store for some plastic bags
Sent her to the store for some rubber bands
I started pitching so easy
I throw the work to you underhand
Underworld, underground, underline

You know by now, I want it more than anything
If I walk away and just let you leave
You'll be stuck in my head like a melody
I know you want it (yeah)
But I'm hesitating (why?)
You must be crazy, I got a man, you got a lady
I know, we here together, so this must be something special
'Cause you could be anywhere you wanted

But you getting carried away, saying we can do it wherever
The way you touching me like no other
I'ma make you feel insane
Trying your hardest to make me give in
But I'mma be down to give you what'chu wanting if you keep it up
I strongly doubt this velvet rope would hold me up
And I don't want security rolling up on us (I got you)
I'm not hesitating, I just don't wanna rush
You could be anywhere you wanted

I mean, we could do it like a G
On the couch in V.I.P
Shawty, we could get it on
I'm like, shout out to the DJ for playing this song
Girl, we could act like two damn fools
And everybody think we doing a dance move
Call me, so I can make it juicy for ya
Meet me in the bathroom and you could be my secret lover, girl
And it started with a hug
But now we making love in this club
And we're not gonna stop just because
The people in the crowd are watching us
But we don't give a damn what they say
And this is the, the remix, baby

[Bridge: Usher & Beyoncé]
Come a little closer to daddy, put it on you
Need you to know what happens here, stays here
And I'm ready and willing, almost got to go
Got you standing at attention, keep it on the low
Ain't nobody watching, don't worry, they can't see us
I know I got you hot, now let me in
You in the club or the car, wherever you are

260,Te Quiero,"[Couplet 1]
Un jour je l’ai vue, j’ai tout de suite su que
Qu’on allait devoir faire ces jeux absurdes
Bijoux, bisous et le tralala, mots doux et coups bas
Insultes, coups, etc, etc
Non non ! Pas les miens mais les siens oui
Notre enfant deviendra aussi le sien ensuite
Enfin c’est le juge qui insistera, j’imagine
Imagine-moi la télé sous le bras
Et mes jeans sales et puis tout ça…

[Refrain]
Je l'aime à mort mais pour la vie
On se dira ""oui"", à la vie, à la mort
Et même en changeant d’avis
Même en sachant qu’on a tort
On ne changera pas la vie
Donc comme tout le monde je vais en souffrir
Jusqu’à la mort

Je voudrais être son ombre
Mais je la déteste

Un jour je la reverrai, je le saurai tout de suite
Que ce sera reparti pour un tour de piste
Un môme de plus, un nouveau juge, et puis leurs odeurs de pisse
Ça deviendra juste une fois de plus plus répétitif
Imagine-moi dans mes vieux jeans
Mais cette fois-là, sans domicile

J’aurai l’air d’un con quand je sauterai dans le vide

261,Back When I Knew It All,"[Verse 1]
At the ripe old age of nineteen
I bought a short bed pick up chicks machine
Life ran on beer and gasoline
A half a lap ahead of the law
I had a fake I d that got me into ""Tuffies""
Love was a word I used to get lucky
Was a big time spender with that plastic money
Back when I knew it all

[Chorus]
Back when the world was flat and
Mama and daddy didn't have a clue
That was back
Back when a pitcher of beer and a
Couple shots made me bulletproof
Back when god was a name I used in vain
To get a point across when I got ticked off
Lord I'm learning so much more than
Back when I knew it all

[Verse 2]
I found out credit cards don't mean you're rich
And beer and gasoline don't mix
Yeah step side trucks can't jump a ditch
And those ""big house"" rooms sure are small
I've learned that love is a woman that will settle you down
A sunday sermon can turn life around
Man I can't believe all the answers I've found
Since, back when I knew it all

[Chorus]
Back when the world was flat and
Mama and daddy didn't have a clue
That was back
Back when a pitcher of beer and a
Couple shots made me bulletproof
Back when god was a name I used in vain
To get a point across when I got ticked off
Lord I'm learning so much more than
Back when I knew it all

[Bridge]
I've done some growing up
And I'm still growing up
So I know I'll never be
As smart as I once was
That was back

Back when the world was flat and
Mama and daddy didn't have a clue
That was back

262,Better As A Memory,"[Verse 1]
I move on like a sinners prayer
Letting go like a levee breaks
Walk away as if I don't care
Learn to shoulder my mistakes
I'm built to fade like your favorite song
Getting reckless when there's no need
Laugh as your stories ramble on
Break my heart, but it won't bleed
My only friends are pirates
That's just who I am
I'm better as a memory than as your man

[Verse 2]
Never sure when the truth won't do
I'm pretty good on a lonely night
I move on the way a storm blows through
I never stay, but then again, I might
I struggle sometimes to find the words
Always sure until I doubt
Walk a line until it blurs
Build walls too high to climb out
But I'm honest to a fault
That's just who I am
I'm better as a memory than as your man

[Bridge]
I see you leaning, you're bound to fall
I don't want to be that mistake
I'm just a dreamer and nothing more
You should know it before it gets too late

[Verse 3]
Cause goodbyes are like a roulette wheel
You never know where they're gonna land
First you're spinning, then you're standing still
Left holding a losing hand
But one day you're gonna find someone
And right away you'll know it's true
That all of your seeking's done
It was just a part of the passing through
Right there in that moment you'll finally understand
That I was better as a memory than as your man
Better as a memory than as your man",Kenny Chesney,2008,"[99, 90, 70, 60, 55, 50, 46, 46, 53, 51, 54, 58, 60, 56, 64, 72, 87]",17

And I see antlers up on the wall
When you see a lake you think picnic
And I see a large mouth up under that log
You're probably thinking that you're going to change me
In some ways well maybe you might
Scrub me down, dress me up, oh, but no matter what
Remember, I'm still a guy

[Verse 2]
When you see a priceless French painting
I see a drunk, naked girl
You think that riding a wild bull sounds crazy
And I'd like to give it a whirl
Well, love makes a man do some things he ain't proud of
And in a weak moment I might walk your sissy dog, hold your purse at the mall
But remember, I'm still a guy

I'll pour out my heart
Hold your hand in the car
Write a love song that makes you cry
Then turn right around, knock some jerk to the ground

I can hear you now talking to your friends
Saying, ""Yeah girls he's come a long way""
From dragging his knuckles and carrying a club
And building a fire in a cave
But when you say a backrub means only a backrub
Then you swat my hand when I try
Well, now, what can I say at the end of the day
Honey, I'm still a guy

And I'll pour out my heart
Hold your hand in the car
Write a love song that makes you cry

Now, now she loved me, shawty, I loved her
Used to jump up in the Maybach and roll out
Used to care, she used to share
The love that she used to give me can't be found
I lost my way, she said she'd stay
And lately, I've been sleeping with a ghost
My stock is down and out, I used to be worth my weight in gold
That was before a great depression kicked in and rocked us
And that was before the hurricane came in and stopped us

She, she don't touch me, I don't touch her
We rarely even ever say a word
I really want to give her everything she deserves
But the bad took away the good
She thinks that I'm full of it, arguments
Always pissed, man I'm tired
Every kiss that I miss
Girl, you know I'm trying
You never believe when I say
And I never believe it when you say
""I love you"", and I shouldn't complain about it
I should take it like a man and walk up out it

[Verse 1: Usher & Beyoncé]
Now, baby girl, there ain't nothing more that I can say
You know by now, I want it more than anything
If I walk away and just let you leave
You'll be stuck in my head like a melody
I know you want it (yeah)
But I'm hesitating (why?)
You must be crazy, I got a man, you got a lady
I know, we here together, so this must be something special
'Cause you could be anywhere you wanted

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
But you decided to be here with me
No coincidence, it was meant to be
Don't be shy, come let your boy get in
So you can tell all of your friends
You was on the remix, like...

[Chorus: Usher]
In this club, in this club
Ladies, can I put this love up on you one time?
If you ain't scared, say what's up

Baby, I don't give up in this club

[Verse 2: Beyoncé, Usher & Both]
Baby, you know I'd be down
But we can't have all these people staring, standing around
This right here is only for your eyes to see
But you getting carried away, saying we can do it wherever
The way you touching me like no other
I'ma make you feel insane
Trying your hardest to make me give in
But I'mma be down to give you what'chu wanting if you keep it up
I strongly doubt this velvet rope would hold me up
And I don't want security rolling up on us (I got you)
I'm not hesitating, I just don't wanna rush
You could be anywhere you wanted

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
But you decided to be here with me
No coincidence, it was meant to be
I guess if I mess around and let you get in

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Shawty want a thug
It started with a hug
And the rest went like this
I gave her neck, a kissy-kiss
She gave my neck a kiss back
I said, we could do it like a stack
I mean, we could do it like a G
On the couch in V.I.P
Shawty, we could get it on
I'm like, shout out to the DJ for playing this song
Girl, we could act like two damn fools
And everybody think we doing a dance move
Call me, so I can make it juicy for ya
Meet me in the bathroom and you could be my secret lover, girl
And it started with a hug
But now we making love in this club
And we're not gonna stop just because
The people in the crowd are watching us
But we don't give a damn what they say
And this is the, the remix, baby

[Bridge: Usher & Beyoncé]
Come a little closer to daddy, put it on you
Need you to know what happens here, stays here
And I'm ready and willing, almost got to go
Got you standing at attention, keep it on the low
Ain't nobody watching, don't worry, they can't see us
I know I got you hot, now let me in
You in the club or the car, wherever you are
Run and tell the DJ, run it back on replay

271,Say,"[Verse 1]
I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

[Pre-Chorus]
Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

[Chorus 1]
I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool
When I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you
But I never showed

But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

[Verse 2]
I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

[Chorus 2]
I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more
Than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

[Bridge]
I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

[Chorus 3]
I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise 'til death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
I made it far so I'm thankin' God
I do not go to no bars, I'm in the car with the stars
I can't pull up, I can't park if it ain't valet
I'm in Houston with a bitch and her friend, she gay
She don't suck dick, but tonight it's all in her mouth
I just fucked a bitch who supposed to be my godsis
I'm so dirty, I'm so fucked up, I don't give a damn
And if you owe me, I need taxes like I'm Uncle Sam

Tell me how it's supposed to go
My swag is on overload
But Lil Yachty, now row your boat
They know us, we don't know them hoes
Got my homeboys, got my homegirls
Fuck these haters, I keep living in my own world
I get money, I flip money on my own tours
Own my coupe, skrrt, skrrt, you don't own yours
Champagne in the sky just to toast up in it
Dubs up high, rep the coast up in it
Deuce deuce, two two, go and add both digits
Woo, woo, I had to bring the 4 up in it

I keep bad bitches all around me
I got good drank, so my niggas and these bitches can be straight

I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them, just for one day
We can be heroes, just for one day

And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact

And the guns shot above our heads (Over our heads)
And we kissed, as though nothing could fall (Nothing could fall)

275,Stop And Stare,"[Verse 1]
This town is colder now, I think it's sick of us
It's time to make our move, I'm shaking off the rust
I've got my heart set on anywhere but here
I'm staring down myself, counting up the years
Steady hands just take the wheel
And every glance is killing me
Time to make one last appeal for the life I lead

[Chorus]
Stop and stare
I think I'm moving, but I go nowhere
Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared
But I've become what I can't be, oh
Stop and stare
You start to wonder why you're here not there
And you'd give anything to get what's fair
But fair ain't what you really need
Oh, can you see what I see?

[Verse 2]
They're trying to come back, all my senses push
Untie the weight bags, I never thought I could
Steady feet, don't fail me now
I'm gonna run 'til you can't walk

And I'm standing down

Stop and stare
I think I'm moving, but I go nowhere

From the rooftops I remember
There was snow, white snow
Clearly I remember
From the windows they were watching
While we froze down below
When the future's architectured
By a carnival of idiots on show
You'd better lie low
If you love me, won't you let me know?

[Verse 2]
Was a long and dark December
When the banks became cathedrals
And a fox became God
Priests clutched onto bibles
Hollowed out to fit their rifles
And a cross held aloft
Bury me in armor
When I'm dead and hit the ground
My nerves are poles that unfroze
And if you love me, won't you let me know?

Who the captain of some sinking ship
Would stow, far below

But I don't think I can stop it with a song
Girl that's the kind of way I'm feeling
Trying to stop your leaving
Got a pebble
Got a pebble in my hand
And I toss it out into the middle of the Rio Grande
But the river keeps running
Don't even know that I'm around
I could throw a million more and not slow it down
Girl that's kind of what I'm feeling
Trying to stop your leaving
There's nothing that I wouldn't try
If I thought it would change your mind
But you don't love me
No you don't love me anymore

Flat top, gold chain and some fresh kicks
My nigga Nas told me ""Money Make the World go Round""
And Uncle Luke showed me how to make my girl go down
I've been around Hip Hop since '85

Whoever thought gangsta rap would make noise in the hood?
When the cars ride by with the ""Boomin' System""
Two door Mustang, and the roof was missin'
Every girl at your school had the new extensions
Even gangstas was dancin' like New Edition
Cause the house parties stayed rockin all night
Niggas came through and shot it up but it was alright (alright)
Cause after the cops left, it was a party then

And I, might wrap my wrist dang (go on, derrty, do the damn thang)
I get 'em free (say what) but I pay

If you ain't got 'em when you see me you definitely gon' want 'em
If they knew I gotta get 'em first, old as a copper box
Hook 'em with a shirt, and the matchin' color socks
I think the coldest was the black on black 11's with the red bottom
Or the number 9's, you shoulda seen me when I got 'em
I was in my house (in my house) dancin' in the mirror
Straight thinkin' 'bout gettin out and how I'm 'bout to kill 'em
When you know you got a pair that ain't nobody got (body got)
You can't hold 'em back, homie, you gotta rock (you gotta rock)
I'm a addict, a Jordan fanatic, little Mars Blackmon

281,Inside The Fire,"Ливнем бьет в голову
Сотнями сотен ударов
Старых ран и
Рваных мыслей
Я весь в огне
Я внутри пожара
В самом конце моего пути
Мне некому будет сказать прости
Мне некому будет сказать прощай
Я с целым миром разом попрощаюсь
Весь город забил на принципы
Моя душа забила лишь болт
На всех, кто пихал на виселицу
И кто подталкивает до сих пор
Я рос в гнилье, в рвани
Алкоголе, вне правил
Мой дом это сайлент хилл
Шёпот тысячи живых могил

Весь смысл тут - айсберг
Без цели, весь серый
Здесь каждый на грани
И заперт век в клетке
Вырубаю свет, утром на подъем
Закрываю веки, я под зонтом
В готэме сегодня прольётся кровь
Их герой накидался виски со льдом
И всем наплевать, кто не откроет глаз
Все в спешке с азартом идут на бал
Здесь когда-то было так много красок
Но палитра иссякла, это чёрный вальс
И слышен лишь хохот старика
Ведь он все перевидал уже сотню раз
И сегодня он знает, что кого-то опять
Поглотит наш враг, скажет засыпай
Когда всем будет попросту наплевать (x4)

The tailgate of Billy Don's Ford
I grew up in this little bitty town
Never seen you before
You were swayin' in the moonlight
While the radio played
And I've
I've had that song in my head all day, yeah

It was a sweet Southern soulful thing
That got me down deep
You caught me starin' at you
But you smiled back at me
Started slingin' that air guitar
Man, you sure can play
And I've had that song in my head all day

I don't know who sings it
I keep searchin' the radio
I just wanna hear it
So I can watch that video
I got in my head of a blue-eyed boy
Dancin' in the bed of a two-tone Ford
Oh Lord, is it love?
I just can't say
(But I've)

Yeah, es ist ein unglaublich schöner Tag, und draußen ist es warm
Er ist auf dem Weg nach Hause mit der Bahn
Schaut aus dem Fenster, lässt Gedanken freien Lauf
Lehnt sich ganz entspannt zurück, denn er muss lange noch nicht raus
'N paar Menschen steigen ein, andre wieder aus
Er wechselt grad das Lied und plötzlich stand da diese Frau
Und er dachte sich, wow
Sagte, „Klar, der Platz ist frei.“, sie lachte und er dachte sich nur
Bitte komm, sprich sie an
Das ist das Schönste, was du je gesehen hast
Und sie hat sicherlich kein'n Mann (Mann)

Sie braucht so Sachen, die Frauen halt eben brauchen

286,I Saw God Today,"[Verse 1]
Just walked down the street to the coffee shop
Had to take a break
I've been by her side for eighteen hours straight
Saw a flower growing in the middle of the sidewalk
Pushing up through the concrete
Like it was planted right there for me to see

The flashing lights
The honking horns
All seem to fade away
But in the shadow of the hospital
At 5:08
I saw God today

[Chorus]
I've been to church
I've read the book
I know He's there
But I don't look
Near as often as I should

His fingerprints are everywhere
I just look down and stop and stare
Open my eyes and then I swear
I Saw God Today

[Verse 2]
Saw a couple walking by
They were holding hands
And she had that glow
Yeah, I couldn't help
But I noticed that she was starting to show
Stood there for a minute
Taking in the sky
Lost in that sunset
A splash of amber melting into shades of red

[Chorus]
I've been to church
I've read the book
I know He's there
But I don't look
Near as often as I should

[Verse 3]
Got my face pushed up against the nursery glass
She's sleeping like a rock
My name on her wrist
Wearing tiny pink socks
She's got my nose
She's got her Mama's eyes
My brand new baby girl
She's a miracle

And from that point, I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to toe 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said, ""It felt like they walked and drove on me.""
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, ""'Ye, keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me!""

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again

Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' 'bout me
She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you,"" and I just got through
Talkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do: just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview, I'm representin' you, makin' you proud
Reach for the stars, so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talkin' 'bout Chi-Town

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?

And if you turn off my lights I bet I will glow in the dark
I bet you I will shine bright
As bright as the Prime Night

They locking them in them prisons

She ain't got no heart, shawty like the tin man
Tell her anything she won't feel it’s like thin air
She done heard everything, you can drop a pin there
And she probably hear it, looking in the mirror
Staring at her reflection and it scare her
Every time she cry she feel nobody hear her
Devil all in her ear and he whispering that he dare her
She hear him

Tried to push her in the back where it was dark
She like a gold fish, they got her swimming with the sharks
Year later found her murdered slayed in the park

She was staring out the window, of that SUV
Complaining, saying, I can't wait to turn 18
She said, I'll make my own money, and I'll make my own rules
Mama put the car in park out there in front of the school
And she kissed her head and said, I was just like you

These are some good times
So take a good look around

[Verse 2]
Before she knows it she's a brand new bride
In her one-bedroom apartment, and her daddy stops by
He tells her, it's a nice place
She says, it'll do for now
Starts talking about babies, and buying a house
Daddy shakes his head, and says, baby, just slow down

[Chorus]
Cause you're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast

So take a good look around

Five years later, there's a plumber working on the water heater
Dog's barking, phone's ringing
One kid's crying, one kid's screaming
She keeps apologizing
He says, they don't bother me
I've got two babies of my own
One's 36, one's 23

Don't you ever fix your lips unless you 'bout to suck my dick
Bitch, swallow my words, taste my thoughts
And if it's too nasty, spit it back at me

And sure enough, I got Miss Cita in a better place
When I was 14, I told my mom we will see better days
And sure enough, we did exactly what I said
I tell my girl ""When you fuck me, better fuck me good
'Cause if another girl could, she gonna fuck me good""
No sitting at the table if you bringing nothing to it

And fly with the tongue, so if you feeling froggy, leap (c'mon)
Kermit, you better think before you ribbit
Don't get murdered over your song before you ad-lib it
I pop up like Xzibit, but given I'm at your crib, it's
Not to put no fucking fish tanks in your Civic
Fuck getting your ride pimped, you'll get hog-tied, wimp
Have you in the trunk curled up like fried shrimp
It's been a good year, maybe I should ride blimp
Cause your boy just stay above the game
They tryna tag him, spray a brother frame
But your shots can't reach me, I'm way above your aim
Go 'head, nigga, say another name
Take this family for a joke, play them Wayan brother games
And I'ma Git You Sucka, I be schemin' with this Keenan
Aimin with this Damon, I'm putting that Major Payne in
My Little Man is on ya, Marlon and Shawn ya
Lay the beef on his noodle, make some Luger lasagna
Forty Cal fettuccine, trey pound pasta
You reach for this medallion, you must like Italian, nigga
You only see me pushing if the driver's tired (yes!)
I work the S6 ever since the 5 retired
The drop-top, they say it's Ocean Drive-inspired
So you can call a cab once your bitch fall for Fab

[Chorus: Lil' Wayne]
Uhh, I'm gettin' money like a muhfucka
Shades darker than a bitch but I can see
I got everything, you got nothing
But you ain't got nothing on me
Ohh, I'm gettin' money like a muhfucka
Yeah, money you ain't never see
Yeah, I got everything, you got nothing
But you ain't got nothing on me

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
I'm on the grind 'til the police come
With that pistol on my side, boy, don't be dumb
Or, I let that semi twirl you, now you can follow the drip
'Cause one shot outta the clip'll jheri curl ya (ooh)
Leave you sloppy like seconds, obey me like peasants
Or get opened up like presents, please
My young boys wildin' for respect
Slit your throat, have you smiling with your neck, say cheese
My dough's a bit longer, my flow is just slaughter (yep!)
My wrist look like frozen Poland Spring water
So tell me boys, tell me boys, who you think you messin' with
I get money out the ass, that's some expensive shit (ill!)
Haven't you all heard? (What?) Y'all all herbs (Yup!)
I stick toothpicks (Where?) in y'all hors d'oeuvres
(Listen) I'm a shark, y'all just koi fish
(What else?) Octopus (What else?) Oysters
Chump! I got my eye on your wifey now (yeah!)
I have her lick me up (up!) and then wipe me down (down!)
She told me you's a nag, you's a bug (damn!)
She told me I'm a blast, I'm a stud (damn!)
She told me you be beastin', you be checkin' for the burns
So I gave her knee pads for the rug (haha!)
It's Skull Gang from the chain to the lifestyle
You surfboard dudes get wiped out, totally

[Chorus: Lil' Wayne]
Uhh, I get money like a muhfucka
Shades darker than a bitch but I can see
I got everything, you got nothing
But you ain't got nothing on me
Ohh, I'm gettin' money like a muhfucka
Yeah, money you ain't never see
Yeah, I got everything, you got nothing
But you ain't got nothing on me

[Verse 3: Lil' Wayne]
Get you, 3, 4-get you
Like the number after 1, I'mma get me 2
It's Weezy F.-U, now you gotta have a baby
My money don't folds nor bends, Mercedes
Maybach, grey-black
And I got a 44. and a 'K, like eight stacks
Fuck your city and your town, I state facts
Take that! No, better yet, like Diddy: ""Take that""
Wait. rats, I hate rats, I clean 'em out like Ajax
Got paper like a fax machine, asaneen
Damn I mean asinine, I'm dapper don, and after mine
There will be nine, damn I mean, there will be none
I will be one, of the greatest things you've ever felt
You've ever seen, or heard, Car-ter, Har-vard, y'all scared
Not me, not I, call me Young Popeye
Tell Bluto I'm a nuno, I bring RAL to your funeral
Damn I mean funeral, funerol, you say tomato, I say tomahto
You say get 'em, I say got 'em, yeah I got 'em
Man, you better keep payin me cause you don't want my problems
I be wildin' like Capital One, what is in your wallet?
You fly, but what is it to pilot?
Weezy, I'm at the top, foot up in your bottom
Huh, damn I mean, foot up in your ass
I kick that shit now gon' put it in the trash (Deezle!)

[Chorus/Outro: Lil' Wayne]
Uhh, I'm gettin' money like a muhfucka
Shades darker than a bitch but I can see
I got everything, you got nothing
But you ain't got nothing on me
Yeah, I'm gettin' money like a muhfucka
Yeah, money you'll never see
Yeah, uh, uh
And you ain't got nothing on me
Yeah, I'm gettin' money like a muhfucka
Shades darker than a bitch but I can see
I got everything, you got nothing
But you ain't got nothing on me
Yeah, I'm gettin' money like a muhfucka

Big money nigga, big money nigga
Yeah, and you ain't got nothin' on me",Lil Wayne,2008,[81],1

317,Nine In The Afternoon,"[Verse 1]
Back to the street where we began
Feeling as good as lovers can, you know
Yeah, we're feeling so good

It looks like the end of history as we know
It’s just the end of the world
Back to the street where we began
Feeling as good as love, you could, you can

Into a room where it's nine in the afternoon

And your eyes are the size of the moon

Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom

Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system; a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee

324,I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For,"[Verse 1]
I have climbed the highest mountains
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you
I have run, I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls
Only to be with you

[Chorus]
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

[Verse 2]
I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in her finger tips
It burned like fire
This burning desire
I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone

[Chorus]
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

[Verse 3]
I believe in the Kingdom Come
Then all the colours will bleed into one
Bleed into one
But yes, I'm still running
You broke the bonds
And you loosed the chains
Carried the cross of my shame
Oh my shame, you know I believe it

[Chorus]
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for",U2,2008,"[85, 22]",2
325,What Kinda Gone,"I heard the door slam
And I couldn't tell was it just the wind
Or was she mad again - ah hell
She's gettin in her car
I hollered baby is there something wrong
Thought I heard her say something sounded like I'm gone
But these days gone can mean so many things

Well theres gone for good and theres good and gone
And theres gone with the long before it
I wish she'd been just a little more clear
Well theres gone for the day and gone for the night
And gone for the rest of your dogone life
Is it whiskey night or just a couple beers
I mean what kind of gone are we talkin bout here

Well its gettin dark out, she ain't back yet
Ain't called home, turned off the phone
Ah man hah this might not be good
I would have stopped her, when she went to leave
But I didn't 'cause I didn't really think what I'm thinkin now
I'm still not sure what gone is all about

Well theres gone for good and theres good and gone
And theres gone with the long before it
I wish she'd been just a little more clear
Well theres gone for the day and gone for the night
And gone for the rest of your dogone life
Is it whiskey night or just a couple beers
I mean what kind of gone are we talkin bout here

Is it the kind of gone where she's at her mom's cooling down
She'll come around or the kind that says you had your chance
And she ain't comin back

Well theres gone for good and theres good and gone
And theres gone with the long before it
I wish she'd been just a little more clear
Well theres gone for the day and gone for the night
And gone for the rest of your dogone life
Is it whiskey night or just a couple beers
I mean what kind of gone are we talkin bout here

I mean what kind of gone are we talkin bout

326,Love Is Gone,"[Chorus: Drew Love]
It's hard to sleep these days
The sounds of all the screams keep me awake
Love is gone, love is gone
Bend until we break, stand by and watch us all go up in flames
Love is gone, love is gone (uh, yeah)

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Shit, the world is in flames
We worry about materials and the simplest things
When cops are killing people, and they can't take the blame
They get acquitted, then you wonder why all the people rage, stupid
We all keep praying for peace, praying for progress
If you live in the hills then you stay in the projects
So folks won't listen if they think what I'm saying is conscious
They'd rather hear me turning up on some simpler topics
Yeah, so what's my place, am I outta line?
Then speaking on what's going on and saying what's on my mind?
This shit is fucked up, plus it's happening all the time
My job, as a rapper is to entertain, we tryna shine
I'm not no politician, but they listen, somebody inform 'em
All the kids gotta find out what's really important
I got a platform and a voice and a stage to perform on
Music could be a good escape, but outside it's been storming, yeah

[Chorus: Drew Love]
It's hard to sleep these days
The sounds of all the screams keep me awake
Love is gone, love is gone
Bend until we break, stand by and watch us all go up in flames
Love is gone, love is gone (yeah, uh)

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
As I sit in the studio, guess the thinking is
If the statement's too crazy, then should I finish this?
Or if my image is pretty, don't wanna blemish this
Or ever split up my fans, reduce my relevance
Pay attention and understand what the premise is
Everything not gravy, we can't pretend it is
So I salute YG, fuck the president
'Cause he a fucking racist supported by white supremacists
Fuck Donald, go back to just running businesses
We all wishing somehow we could've prevented this
Until we all love each other, nobody benefits
Minorities and feminists, trans, gays, and immigrants
The government mix politics and religiousness
So a man's body's more free than a woman's is
The anger is real, the riots are limitless
And nothing's gonna change 'til we killing off all this ignorance, yeah

[Chorus: Drew Love]
It's hard to sleep these days
The sounds of all the screams keep me awake
Love is gone, love is gone
Bend until we break, stand by and watch us all go up in flames
Love is gone, love is gone

Just one switch, I can make the ass drop (Hey)
Ayy, take you to the smoke shop
We gon' get high, ayy, we gon' hit Rodeo
Dial up Valentino, we gon' hit Pico
Take you where I'm from, take you to the slums

328,The World I Know,"[Verse 1]
Has our conscious shown?
Has the sweet breeze blown?
Has all kindness gone?
Hope still lingers on
I drink myself of new found pity
Sitting alone in New York City
And I don't know why

Are we listening?
Hymns of offering
Have we eyes to see?
Love is gathering
All the words that I've been reading
Have now started the act of bleeding
Into one
Into one

So I walk up on high
And I step to the edge
To see my world below
And I laugh at myself
While the tears roll down
Cause it's the world I know
It's the world I know

I drink myself of newfound pity
Sitting alone in New York City
And I don't know why, don't know why

While the tears roll down
'Cause it's the world I know

To see my world below

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulkin' to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook at me, feelin' me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

I was chokin' in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...

Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

I could stay awake just to hear you breathin'
Watch you smile while you are sleeping

Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (Ah-hoo!)

I'm growin' tired, and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

Too late to save myself from falling

But you misread my meanin' when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me

But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm

To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free

And a million miles

To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

336,The Music Of The Night,"[PHANTOM: Verse 1]
Nighttime sharpens, heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
Silently the senses abandon their defenses

[Verse 2]
Slowly, gently, night unfurls its splendor
Grasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender
Turn your face away from the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away from cold, unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night

[Verse 3]
Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before
Close your eyes, let your spirit start to soar!
And you'll live as you've never lived before

[Verse 4]
Softly, deftly, music shall surround you
Feel it, hear it closing in around you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness which you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night

[Verse 5]
Let your mind start a journey to a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before
Let your soul take you where you long to be
Only then can you belong to me

[Verse 6]
Floating, falling, sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me, savor each sensation
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night

[Outro]
You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the night",Andrew Lloyd Webber,2008,[77],1

338,Hollywood's Not America,"[Verse 1]
Born Helena Jane
With a restless soul
She moved west to California
Became a centerfold
But once you change your name
Well the pieces fall
Now she hardly recognizes
Herself at all

[Chorus]
And there's never any rain
When you want it
A hollow little game
And you've won it
Looking for a thrill
But you've done it all

So long
Put your blue jeans back on, girl
Go home
Remember, Hollywood's not America[2x]
Oh Yeah!

[Verse 2]
And everybody here's
From somewhere else
You can make a million dollars
Well, you might lose yourself
And you can take the heat
Will your heart grow cold?
They say acting's just pretending
But even that gets old

And there's never any rain
When you want it
A hollow little game
And you've won it
Looking for a thrill

339,I'm Alive,"[GABE]
I am what you want me to be
And I'm your worst fear
You'll find it in me
Come closer
Come closer

I am more than memory
I am what might be
I am mystery
You know me
So show me

When I appear
It's not so clear
If I'm a simple spirit
Or I'm flesh and blood

And I feed on the fear that's behind your eyes
And I need you to need me, it's no surprise

I'm alive
So alive
I'm alive

I am flame and I am fire
I am destruction, decay, and desire
I'll hurt you
I'll heal you

I'm your wish, your dream come true
And I am your darkest nightmare too
I've shown you
I own you

And though you made me
You can't change me
I'm the perfect stranger
Who knows you too well

But I'm alive, I'm alive, I am so alive
And I'll tell you the truth if you let me try
You're alive, I'm alive, and I'll show you why

I'm alive
So alive
I'm alive

I'm right behind you
You say forget, but I'll remind you
You can try to hide but you know that I will find you

Cause if you won't grieve me
You won't leave me behind

Oh-ho, oh
Whoa
Whoa

No, no, no

340,Sorry,"[Written by Julia Michaels, Justin Tranter, and Justin Bieber]

[Verse 1]
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Verse 2]
I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

341,Bubbly,"[Intro]
Will you count me in?

[Verse 1]
I've been awake for a while now
You've got me feeling like a child now
'Cause every time I see your bubbly face
I get the tingles in a silly place

[Chorus]
It starts in my toes and I crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile, please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

[Verse 2]
The rain is falling on my window pane
But we are hiding in a safer place
Under covers, staying dry and warm
You give me feelings that I adore

They start in my toes, make me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile, please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go

But what am I gonna say
When you make me feel this way?
I just... Mmm

[Breakdown]
I've been asleep for a while now
You tuck me in, just like a child now
'Cause every time you hold me in your arms
I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth

It starts in my soul and I lose all control
When you kiss my nose, the feeling shows
'Cause you make me smile, baby, just take your time now
Holding me tight

342,Paralyzer,"[Verse 1]
I hold on so nervously to me and my drink
I wish it was cooling me
But so far has not been good, it's been shitty
And I feel awkward as I should

[Pre-Chorus 1]
This club has got to be the most pretentious thing
Since I thought you and me
Well, I am imagining a dark lit place
Or your place or my place

[Chorus]
Well, I'm not paralyzed, but I seem to be struck by you
I wanna make you move because you're standing still
If your body matches what your eyes can do
You'll probably move right through me on my way to you

[Verse 2]
I hold out for one more drink, before I think
I'm looking too desperately
But so far has not been fun, I should just stay home
If one thing really means one

[Pre-Chorus 2]
This club will hopefully be closed in three weeks
That would be cool with me
Well, I'm still imagining a dark lit place
Or your place or my place

I wanna make you move because you're standing still
If your body matches what your eyes can do

343,Hallelujah,"[Verse 1]
Now I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do ya?
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing ""Hallelujah""

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Verse 2]
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Verse 3]
You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to ya?
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Verse 4]
I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool ya
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord of song
With nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
Baby, I've been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
There was a time you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show it to me, do you?
And remember when I moved in you
The holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah",Leonard Cohen,2008,[68],1
344,All-American Girl,"[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Since the day they got married
He'd been praying for a little baby boy
Someone he could take fishing
Throw the football and be his pride and joy
He could already see him holding that trophy
Taking his team to state
But when the nurse came in with a little pink blanket
All those big dreams changed

[Chorus]
And now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American girl

[Verse 2]
Sixteen short years later
She was falling for the senior football star
Before you knew it, he was dropping passes
Skipping practice just to spend more time with her
The coach said, ""Hey, son, what's your problem?
Tell me, have you lost your mind?""
And Daddy said, ""You'll lose your free ride to college
Boy, you better tell her goodbye""

[Chorus]
But now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American

[Bridge]
And when they got married and decided to have one of their own
She said, ""Be honest, tell me what you want""
And he said, ""Honey, you oughta know
Sweet little, beautiful, one just like you
Oh, a beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American""

I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street (okay)

Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family (sheesh)

Don't have a face, so now you late, open the gates (God damn)

Face, young boy done caught a case (ooh)

Let him get the Senzu Bean so he regenerate (oh)

Ultimate, infinite, flow is opium
Open the internet, photosynthesis
Put in parentheses, temporary
Very scary if I feel like Dirty Harry
Just might bust a bitch, never knew my life
But yet the question is, ""Is he fake? Is he real?""
What the message is, chop a bitch nigga up
I'ma sever it when I sever shit
I kill 'em, no Kony, these niggas ain't homies
Claim you the homie, I turn into Broly
Droppin' melodic, enter the cosmic

Flow like a foreigner, I'm the torturer

Woah, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy, but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (Yah I said it)
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food
Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you
Fuck you too, woo!

Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'
You mighta went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time
I ain't no gangster but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of nines
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My 12 days of Christmas was nothin' but lies (I)
Run at you hard like a sumo (Sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (Chulo)
I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno (Woo)
Bitch I'm a dog, call me Cujo (Rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw 4 like a Uno (Bup)
Cállate boca mejor, maricón, little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)
They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now
Shit get relevant 'til 'nother beef die down
In truth, a nigga just really want me tied down
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope (Yeah)
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
Nigga, wrong way, wrong road (Woo, woo)
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (Vroom!)

[Pre-Verse: Eminem]
I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em
Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference?
I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man, I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I've been eatin' long enough, man, my stomach should be full
I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me
Fuck you think? (Woo!)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I got a couple of mansions
Still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghost writers
But to these kids it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop?""
I said, ""I don't have any answers.""
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, ""What a wonderful feeling!""
""We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!""
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap
Let's recap, way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They know what button to press or what lever to pull
To get me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya digs in the fuckin' back, ho (Get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least 70 or 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I wrote 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain to pour
In that drought, y'all been prayin' for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboy

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas & Eminem]
So y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice",Eminem,2008,[82],1

You got everything a woman want, I still want to spoil ya
And your loyalty to him ain't my concern cause you’re loyal
It's like we been casted with a spell or both ate some poison
Tell him I ain't mean to intervene with his main thing

Everyday its nice to share our main dreams, and ain't a damn thing

349,Small Town Southern Man,"[Verse 1]
Born the middle son of a farmer
And a small town Southern man
Like his daddy's daddy before him
Brought up working on the land
Fell in love with a small town woman
And they married up and settled down
Natural way of life if you're lucky
For a small town Southern man

[Verse 2]
First there came four pretty daughters
For this small town Southern man
Then a few years later came another
A boy, he wasn't planned
Seven people living all together
In a house built with his own hands
Little words with love and understanding
From a small town Southern man

[Chorus]
And he bowed his head to Jesus
And he stood for Uncle Sam
And he only loved one woman
He was always proud of what he had
He said his greatest contribution
Is the ones you leave behind
Raised on the ways and gentle kindness
Of a small town Southern man

[Verse 3]
Callous hands told the story
For this small town Southern man
He gave it all to keep it all together
And keep his family on his land
Like his daddy, years wore out his body
Made it hard just to walk and stand
You can break the back
But you can't break the spirit
Of a small town Southern man

[Chorus]
And he bowed his head to Jesus
And he stood for Uncle Sam
And he only loved one woman
He was always proud of what he had
He said his greatest contribution
Is the ones you leave behind
Raised on the ways and gentle kindness
Of a small town Southern man

[Verse 4]
Finally, death came calling
For this small town Southern man
He said it's alright 'cause I see angels
And they got me by the hand
Don't you cry, and don't you worry
I'm blessed, and I know I am
'Cause God has a place in Heaven
For the small town Southern man

[Chorus]
And he bowed his head to Jesus
And he stood for Uncle Sam
And he only loved one woman
He was always proud of what he had
He said his greatest contribution

350,When You Look Me In The Eyes,"When you feel the dream is over
Feel the world is on your shoulders
And you lost the strength to carry on
Even though the walls may crumble
And you find you always stumble through
Remember never to surrender to the dark
Cuz if you turn another page
You will see that?s not the way
The story has to end

And if you need to find a way back
Feel you?re on the wrong track
Give it time, you?ll learn to fly
Tomorrow is a new day
And you will find your own way
You?ll be stronger with each day that you cry
Then you?ll learn to fly

In your head, so many questions
The truth is your possession
The answer lies within your heart (within your heart)
You will see the doors are open
If you only dare to hope
And you will find a way to fight
The fears that kept you down
Cuz if you turn another page
You will see that?s not the way
The story has to end

And if you need to find a way back
Feel you?re on the wrong track
Give it time, you?ll learn to fly
Tomorrow is a new day
And you will find your own way
You?ll be stronger with each day that you cry
Then you?ll learn to fly

Looking at your situation
There?s so much that you can do
Now?s the time to make your stand
This is just an observation
In the end it?s up to you
The future?s in your hands

But not tonight

I'd like to be a princess on a throne
To have a country I can call my own
And a king
Who's lusty and requires a fling
With a female thing

Great, men will be men
Let me turn on the gas
I caught them in the den with
Marvin grabbing Whizzer's ass

Oh sure, I'm sure, he's sure he did his best
I mean he meant to be what he was not
The things he was are things which I forgot
He's a queen
I'm a queen
Where is my crown?

I'm breaking down
I'm breaking down
My life is shitty
And my kid seems like an idiot to me
I mean that's sick
I mean he's great
It's me who is the matter
Talking madder
Than the maddest hatter

If I repeat one more word
I swear I'll lose my brain
Oh, what else should I explain?
Oh, yes it's true
I can cry on cue
But so can you

I'm breaking down
I'm breaking down
Down, down
You ask me ""Is it fun to cry over nothing?""
It is, I'm breaking down

Now let's consider what I might do next
I hate admitting I've become perplexed
I'm bereaved
I've cried, I've shook, I've yelled, I've heaved
I have been deceived

As enemies go
Whizzer is not so bad
It's just he's so damn happy
That it makes me so damn mad

I want to hate him but I really can't
It's like a nightmare how this all proceeds
I hope that Whizzer don't fulfill his needs
Don't is wrong
Sing along
What was the noun?

I'm breaking down
I'm breaking down
I'll soon redecorate these stalls
I'd like some padding on the walls
And also pills
I wanna sleep
Sure, things'll probably worsen
But it's not like I'm some healthy person

I've rethought my talks with Marv
And one fact does emerge
I think I like his shrink
So that is why I might turn to drink
I'm on the brink

Of breaking down
I'm breaking down
Down, down
I only want to love a man who can love me....
Or like me...
Or help me...
Help me!

Marvin was never mine
He took his meetings in the boys' latrine
I used to cry
He'd make a scene
I'd rather die
Than dry-clean
Marvin's wedding gown

I'm breaking down
I'm breaking down
It's so upsetting when you've found
That what's rectangular is round
I mean it stinks
I mean he's queer
And me, I'm just a freak
Who needs it maybe every other week

I've rethought the fun we've had
And one fact does emerge:
I've played the foolish clown
The almost virgin who sing this dirge
Is on the verge

357,Teardrops On My Guitar,"[Verse 1]
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

[Verse 2]
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

[Verse 3]
Drew walks by me
Can't he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

[Pre-Chorus 3]
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

So I drive home alone, as I turn off the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar

He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

361,The Anthem,"[Intro: King Tech]
One two, one two
We dedicate this one to the Hip-Hop culture, y'all
Brought to you by the world-famous Wake Up Show

[Verse 1: RZA]
Bobby Steels, Staple' tales, MC's get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred sword-play, tongue-twist piercin' holes in you
You can't escape 70,000 kilowatts blast through your box
Walk with alarm clocks, cars drivin' slow down the block
One stopped, parks, pops the trunk
Snare pops loud as Glock shots
Bass like an M-80 in your face cops stop, give us citation
We pause for radio station identification

[Interlude]
Wake up, wake up, wake up!
Tech is on

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
When I woke up, I grabbed the mic and never choked up
Busted a verse and all the G's in Cali loc'ed up
When I was summoned
Styles were mixed like the Drummonds
Killer clown is comin', look around, your town is crumblin'
This Big Tech from the Midwest
Leavin' MC's listless on the Wake Up Show
Make up no stories about my shake-up flow
Put me off in a cypher
Partner, you can't fuck with the sniper
Your flow's premature, clean your dirty diaper
Mic heister, psycho alpha-schizo
Hypno, cryo gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter
Sway and Tech heard me flow and it's sealed
Now I got Swedish women yelling ""Tech N9ne's vild!""

[Verse 3: Eminem]
This place is my house
I might as well erase my face with white out
‘Cause y'all can't see me like Ma$e's eyebrows (Where you at?)
Climbed out of a nice house
Through the front window, and heard this guy shout
""Hey that's my couch!""
Pull a 9 out during a rhyme bout
While I'm rippin' this shit, put a clip in and spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than a convertible flippin' vertical
Nose-first with the top off landing upside down
Get tied down and duct-taped—fuck rape!
I'd rather just hump a slut's leg with my nuts shaved
It's Sway and Tech, two disk jockeys
Breakin' so many freakin' needles I wonder if they inject

[Verse 4: Xzibit]
Lo and behold, better than platinum and gold
Yes, God bless success, never forsake the soul
Xzibit take control—locked, loaded, and ready to roll
Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold
‘Cause your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up
Or listen to my niggas Tech and Sway so you can wake up
The X-Man, catch me doin' drills in the Danger Room
Big game huntin' from high noon to the full moon

[Verse 5: Pharoahe Monch]
With synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush
From minimum thrusts
Bust multiple assaults in small interims
As horrid as Boris Karloff was
When I cut your neck, leave a little piece of skin
So the head won't fall off
Hauled-off, sawed off shotgun blast
He asked: ""Why did he have to die like cast metal?""
Oh, see, now like Omar Credle
We pone pedal at a high resolution
On the Wake Up Show with Sway, Tech and DJ Revolution

[Verse 6: Kool G Rap]
I sway the TEC with the Tech and Sway
Step away, weapon spray, rep today
Who over debt to pay get swept away
Across the whole board, like checker play
When I blaze, your whole sect' arrays
Wake Up Show for those who slept away
Niggas that met the tre, hit the deck and pray
DJ Revolution, spinnin' like lead from out the Heck and K
Tearin' your neck away, flood up the street with blood redecorate until the head of Jakes investigate

[Interlude: Jayo Felony]
Sway can give it to, but what you gon' do with it?
Tech can give it to you, but what you gon' do?
Rev can give it to you, but what you gon' do with it?
I can give it to you, wha-wha-wha-what-what!

[Verse 7: Chino XL]
Chino make the world go 'round
Fuckin' up entire record companies like Harrell did to Motown
Vominous talk, poison pen, ominous walk
Which flow will I destroy you with this time
The most commonest thought
The drama that's brought caught us
In the midst of a sibling rivalry
For instance, there is nothing born in existence that can survive with me
Clone me like sheep, I clean house like Tony Randall
My style filed sexual harassment, like Tisha Campbell
You wack like Will Smith, your rhyme style is pansy
I fuckin' murder your young style, like JonBenét Ramsey
Now who the master to beg?
Your demo get passed on the reg'
You shouldn't have been signed if you had a white cast on your leg
I'm Wake Up Show reppin' with Sway and Tech
My TEC's like Tekken, the industry weapon
I'm Chino X—bring KRS in!

[Verse 8: KRS-One]
De-de-de-da-de-de-de-da-di-day
KRS-One comin' with the Tech and Sway
Yo, I rock up on the littlest set and up on the biggest set
As ill as it gets I still manage to wiggle your neck with sweat
Never forget: the bigger the budget, the bigger the debt
You gotta be, willin' to rock in the middle of dry
And in the middle of wet
But I'm willin' to bet, on a Sway and a Tech, they stay in effect
Never been a pain in the neck, they gainin' respect

And I'll carry you all the way

Couldn't wait to try our fake IDs
We only had a few days
And a whole lot of memories to make

Oh, man, we were livin'
Didn't waste one minute
We talked and drank and danced and said goodbye
We laughed until we cried

This past year my family
Was sittin' cross-legged 'round the Christmas tree
Listenin' to granddad
We all knew it'd probably be his last
He was crackin' jokes and we were takin' turns
Tellin' stories 'bout fishin' or lessons learned
Out on the porch with him
We all felt like kids again

[Chorus]
Oh, man, we were livin
Sittin' there reminiscin'
We sang and talked and traveled back in time
We laughed until we cried

[Bridge]
It's like the best days under the sun
Every emotion rolled into one
A little of this, a little of that
Kinda happy, kinda sad

[Verse 3]
Just the other night the baby was cryin'
So I got out of bed rocked her awhile
And I held her tight
And I told her it would be all right
And my mind went back to a few years ago
When we tried so long, we almost gave up hope
And I remember you
Comin' in and tellin me the news

And I'm trying to pretend
So I'll play this feeling over and over again
I owned alone this memory
Maybe I should awake instead
But I'm on my way to go back inside my head

[Chorus]
I close my eyes and try to hide
But wake when these dreams collide

So I’ll put this on repeat
And I'll make up what comes next
Now I lay here daydreaming on your chest

I close my eyes and try to hide
But wake when these dreams collide

But it all breaks down
If I keep on wasting all my time
All alone in my head
Wish I never thought about it in the end

Did you improve on the design, did you do something new?
Well, your name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?
You! The more famous person you come through
And the sexy lady next to you—you come too
And then it hit me—standing outside of Heaven
Waiting for God to come and get me: I'm too uncouth

So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&Ms are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every song's her favorite song; and mics don't feedback
All the reviewers say, ""You need to go and see that""

On hard streets, I been trying to serve them crack fiends
I remember them days I ain't have no clothes

Stay one hundred to the grave, ain't gon' never change
Shout out to my mama, put her through so much pain

My bitch got mad and fucked another nigga
Man that shit was crazy, ain't gon' lie it made me heartless
Fell in love with money, it's gon' stay with me regardless

I asked her to stay, but she wouldn't listen
And she left before I had the chance to say
Oh, oh
Words that would mend the things that were broken
But now it's far too late; she's gone away

[Pre-Chorus]
Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking, ""Why does this happen to me?
Why does every moment have to be so hard?""

Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you

The noises that she made, kept me awake

The weight of things that remained unspoken
Built up so much it crushed us every day

When the sun goes down, I'll be back in the town
Stash box down, put the magnum down

Waitin on it like... three, two, one - yeah right now

Baby girl got a thang for me

Ten years, man, I hated that work
I made a break with the money I saved
It took me to the beach to have a beer by the edge of the sea
And this 'round a clock place
I drank my money away

'Cause my jeans, yeah, they fit, but it might benefit
Me to throw somethin' on
To feature my hips, accentuate my shit
And steal the show

Soon as we walk through the door
Fellas be grabbin' at us like ""yo""

We sippin' Grigio, slow
If your neck and your wrist coordinate
Hair braided or faded OK...
We can move this back to my place

From the bar to VIP, we migrate
From the party to the after party, migrate
After party to hotel, migrate

As we proceed getting buzzed the envious ones
Hatin' but they can't take their eyes off us
But we don't see none of that
They playin' my jam and the floor is packed
See ya'll need to migrate up out the door
We're clinkin' glasses, compliments of the club
We raise their status, so you know they show us love
Everywhere we go they gon' flock
Them boys migrate to where it's hot

Got stacks, plus I'm back with Mariah
We stay down like four flats on a Cadillac
Back to the back, we fall flat, girl
If you feel like doing a dance
I'm gonna pull up my pants c'mon back, girl
But I gotta migrate to bar, from the bar to the floor
From the floor to the car, from the car to the crib
Then back to the club, we can migrate it all night
And mini coupe sitting on dubs
Whatcha waitin' on? I can't stand in one place
I'm on a Platinum Patrón and I hate when I don't get it my way
So don't wait for me to buy drinks or you gon' dehydrate
It's time to migrate

Soon as I walk through the door
They know I'm from the 8-5-0
I need three bottles of that Patrón

Shawty show it like it ain't OK
We can move this back to my place
Shawty best believe, it's time to migrate

Soon as we walk through the door
Fellas be grabbin' at us like ""yo""

381,Praying For Time,"These are the days of the open hand, they will not be the last
Look around now
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers
This is the year of the hungry man, whose place is in the past
Hand in hand with ignorance and legitimate excuses

The rich declare themselves poor, and most of us are not sure
If we have too much, but we'll take our chances
'Cause god's stopped keeping score
I guess somewhere along the way he must have let us all out to play
Turned his back, and all god's children crept out the back door

And it's hard to love, there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much, much too late
Well maybe we should all be praying for time

These are the days of the empty hand, oh you hold on to what you can
And charity is a coat you wear twice a year
This is the year of the guilty man, your television takes a stand
And you find that what was over there is over here

So you scream from behind your door
Say ""What's mine is mine and not yours""
I may have too much but i'll take my chances
'Cause god's stopped keeping score
And you cling to the things they sold you
Did you cover your eyes when they told you
That he can't come back
'Cause he has no children to come back for

It's hard to love, there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much too late
So maybe we should all be praying for time",George Michael,2008,"[94, 27]",2

Lord there is none like you
All of my days, I want to praise

Tower of refuge and strength

Never cease to worship you

Shout to the Lord, all the earth
Let us sing
Power and majesty, praise to the king
Mountains bow down and the seas will roar
At the sound of your name
I sing for joy at the works of your hands
Forever I'll love you, forever I'll stand
Nothing compares to the promise I have in you",Ruben Studdard,2008,[43],1

388,What Hurts The Most,"[Verse 1]
I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That don’t bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
I’m not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though goin' on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I’m okay
But that’s not what gets me

[Chorus]
What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin' so much to say
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowing
What could've been
And not seein' that love in you
Is what I was tryin’ to do

[Verse 2]
It’s hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I’m doin’ It
It’s hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I’m alone
Still harder
Gettin' up, gettin' dressed, livin’ with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken

[Chorus]
What hurts the most
Is being so close
And havin' so much to say much to say
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowing
What could've been
And not seeing that love in you
Is what I was trying to do, oh

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin' so much to say (much to say)
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that love in you
Is what I was trying to do, oh

Don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen

I close both locks below the window

And the shadow of the day will embrace the world in grey

Sometimes beginnings aren't so simple
Sometimes goodbye's the only way

She don't believe in shootin' stars

Couture from the store's departments
You more like ""love to start shit""
I'm more of the trips to Florida
Ordered the hors d'oeuvres, views of the water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man, why can't life always be this easy?
She in the mirror dancin' so sleazy
I get a call like, ""Where are you, Yeezy?""

These shoes are all wrong
Just look in my closet
Not a thing to put on
I wonder how these jeans make me look from behind
Things that never cross a man's mind

Now can't we just talk
Lets lay here and cuddle
Till we both drift off
If we don't make love
That'll be just fine
Things that never cross a man's mind

That joke is too dirty
This steak is too thick
Ain't no way in the world I'll ever finish it

This beer is too cold
And watching all this football is sure getting old
Wish I was working this weekend
Not on the lake threading my line
Things that never cross a man's mind

Her skirt is too tight
Her legs are too long
And her heels are too high

I think I'm fixing to start

Ayy, lil' shawty, pop my whoadie
Pockets on Pinocchio, poking, yuh
Hit her from the back, damn, that bitch bleeding
Said that I knocked her period on
Remember when I had that poker, huh
Instead of looking over my shoulder, huh
Forces with a nigga, no Yoda, huh
That mean a young nigga got woo on me (Ayy)

[Pre-Chorus: Kodak Black]
You ain't the one for me, baby
You ain't got shit I need, bitch
You want me to take my time with you
Well maybe I'm not your speed, bitch
Maybe I'm out your league, bitch
You ain't even got no cheese, bitch
Maybe I'm just too G for you
Or maybe I'm just too street, bitch

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I can't even roll in peace (Why?)
Everybody notice me (Yeah)
I can't even go to sleep (Why?)
I'm rolling on a bean (Yeah)
They tried to give me eight
Got on my knees like, ""Jesus, please""
He don't even believe in Jesus
Why you got a Jesus piece?
If you wanna leave, just leave, but you ain't gotta lie to me
Even the blind can see (Fuck)
That you ain't gon' ride for me
You ain't even showing me the love you say you got me for me
There ain't no loyalty, you lied to me
You say that you gon' ride for me, ayy

402,Letter To Me,"[Verse 1]
If I could write a letter to me
And send it back in time to myself at seventeen
First I'd prove it's me by sayin' look under your bed
There's a Skoal can and a Playboy no one else would know you hid
And then I'd say I know it's tough
When you break up after seven months
And yeah, I know you really liked her and it just don't seem fair
But all I can say is pain like that is fast and it's rare

[Chorus]
And, oh, you've got so much goin' for you, goin' right
But I know at seventeen it's hard to see past Friday night
She wasn't right for you and still you feel like there's a knife
Stickin' out of your back and you're wonderin' if you'll survive
But you'll make it through this and you'll see
You're still around to write this letter to me

[Verse 2]
At the stop sign at Tomlinson and Eighth
Always stop completely, don't just tap your brakes
And when you get a date with Bridgett, make sure the tank is full
On second thought forget it, that one turns out kinda cool
Each and every time you have a fight
Just assume you're wrong and dad is right
And you should really thank Mrs. Brinkman, she spends so much extra time
It's like she sees the diamond underneath and she's polishing you 'til you shine

[Chorus 2]
And, oh, you've got so much goin' for you, goin' right
But I know at seventeen it's hard to see past Friday night
Tonight's the bonfire rally but you're stayin' home instead
Because if you fail Algebra, mom and dad will kill you dead
Trust me you'll squeak by and get a C
And you're still around to write this letter to me

[Verse 3]
You've got so much up ahead, you'll make new friends
You should see your kids and wife
And I'd end up sayin' have no fear
These are nowhere near the best years of your life

[Bridge]
I guess I'll see you in the mirror, when you're a grown man
P.S.: Go hug Aunt Rita every chance you can

[Chorus]
And, oh, you've got so much goin' for you, goin' right
But I know at seventeen it's hard to see past Friday night
I wish you'd study Spanish, I wish you'd taken typin' class
I wish you wouldn't worry, let it be, hey I'd say have a little faith and you'll see

403,Stealing Cinderella,"[Verse 1]
I went to see her dad for a sit down man to man
It wasn't any secret, I'd be asking for her hand
I guess that's why he left me waiting
In the living room by myself
With at least a dozen pictures of her sitting on a shelf
She was

[Chorus]
Playing Cinderella
She was riding her first bike
Bouncing on the bed and looking for a pillow fight
Runnin' through the sprinkler with a big popsicle grin
Dancin with her dad, lookin up at him
In her eyes I'm prince charming
But to him I'm just some fellow
Riding in and stealing Cinderella

[Verse 2]
I leaned in towards those pictures
To get a better look at one
When I heard a voice behind me say
""Now, ain't she somethin son?""
I said ""Yeah, she's quite a woman""
And he just stared at me
And I realized that in his eyes she would always be

[Chorus]
Playing Cinderella
She was riding her first bike
Bouncing on the bed and looking for a pillow fight
Runnin' through the sprinkler with a big popsicle grin
Dancin with her dad, lookin up at him
In her eyes I'm prince charming
But to him I'm just some fellow
Riding in and stealing Cinderella

[Bridge]
Oh, he slapped me on the shoulder
Then he called her in the room
When she threw her arms around him
That's when I could see it too

[Chorus]
She was playing Cinderella
She was riding her first bike
Bouncing on the bed looking for a pillow fight
Runnin' through the sprinkler with a big popsicle grin
Dancin with her dad, lookin up at him

It's too late baby, there's no turning around
I got my hands in my pocket and my head in a cloud
This is how I do, when I think about you
I never thought that you could break me apart
I keep a sinister smile and a hole in my heart
You want to get inside, then you can get in line
But not this time

[Chorus]
'Cause you caught me off guard
Now I'm running and screaming
I feel like a hero and you are my heroine

[Verse 2]
I won't try to philosophize
I'll just take a deep breath then I'll look in your eyes
This is how I feel, and it's so surreal
I got a closet filled up to the brim
With the ghosts of my past and their skeletons
And I don't know why
You'd even try
But I won't lie

[Chorus]
You caught me off guard
Now I'm running and screaming
I feel like a hero and you are my heroine
Do you know that your love is the sweetest sin?

[Verse 3]
And I feel a weakness coming on
It never felt so good to be so wrong
Had my heart on lockdown
And then you turned me around
And I'm feeling like a newborn child
Every time I get a chance to see you smile
It's not complicated
I was so jaded

Fallin' on deaf ears of corn

You move slow, you gettin' pressure from cops
You don't know whether or not to lay low
'Cause 25 to life is no joke
To all my real guerillas thuggin'
On top of corners every day strugglin'
All the beautiful women's gettin' money
Washin' them dollar bills like laundry

[Hook: Akon]
I'ma tell you like Wu told me
Cash Rules Everything Around Me
Singin' dollar, dollar bill, y'all (dollar, dollar bill, y'all)

Weezy, she used to be…
And she used to be the sweetest girl!

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
She used to be the sweetest girl ever
Whatever, now she like sour amaretto
She wears a dress to the T like the letter
And if you make it rain she will be under the weather
She used to run track back in high school
Now she tricks on the track right by school
She take the loss 'cause she don't wanna see her child lose
So respect her, or pay up for the time used
And then she runs to the pastor
And he tells her there will be a new chapter
But she feels no different after
And then she ask him: ""Where my money at?""

411,Going On,"[Verse 1]
I've seen it with my own eyes
How we're getting otherwise, without the luxury of leaving
The touch and feeling of free is intangible, technically
Something you've got to believe in
Connect the cause and effect, one foot in front of the next
This is the start of a journey
And my mind is already gone
And the fear of the unknown
Somehow, just doesn't concern me
And you can stand right there, if you want

[Chorus]
But I'm going on
And I'm prepared to go it alone
I'm going on
To a place in the sun that's nice and warm
I'm going on
And I'm sure they'll have a place for you, too

[Verse 2]
Anyone that needs what they want
And doesn't want what they need
I want nothing to do with
I aim to do what I want, and to do what I please
Is first off my to-do list
But every once in a while, I think about her smile
One of the few things I do miss
But, baby, I've got to go
Baby, I've got to know
Baby, I've got to prove it
And I'll see you, when you get there

[Chorus]
But, I'm going on
And I'm prepared to go it alone
I'm going on
May my love lift you up to the place you belong
I'm going on
And I promise I'll be waiting for you",Gnarls Barkley,2008,[88],1

420,If I Had Eyes,"[Verse 1]
If I had eyes in the back of my head
I would have told you that
You looked good
As I walked away

If you could have tried to trust the hand that fed
You would've never been hungry
But you never really be

The more of this or less of this or is there any difference
Or are we just holding onto the things we don't have anymore

[Chorus]
Sometimes time doesn't heal
No, not at all
Just stand still
While we fall
In or out of love again I doubt I'm going to win you back
When you got eyes like that
It won't let me in
Always looking out

[Backing vocals and claps]

[Verse 2]
Lot of people spend their time just floating
We were victims together but lonely
You got hungry eyes that just can't look forward
Can't give them enough but we just can't start over

Building with bent nails we're
Falling but holding, I don't want to take up anymore of your time
Time, time, time

[Chorus]
Sometimes time doesn't heal
No, not at all
Just stand still
While we fall
In or out of love again I doubt I'm going to win you back
When you got eyes like that
It won't let me in
Always looking out

421,What Is It,"(Sydney)
When I told you I ain't like you
I wasn't being real
Your swag is on point
And your vibe is so chill
You've been on my mind for the past 24 hours
Thinking to myself
What could be ours (ours, ours, ours)
Cause I got a thing for you but you don't know
But you sped up on me
Don't try to play no games
Tay tell him what I'm saying

(Sydney, Tatyana, Korin)
Is it your style? Is it your laugh?
Is it the way you don't judge me by past?
Is it your smile?
Is it that you wild?
Tell me what is it?
What is it, tell me what is it?

(Tatyana)
The way you look at me
I lose my thoughts
Some type of way you got me feeling
Cause I'm caught in a trance
Or is it the way you been holding my hand
Or maybe it's the way you moving slow with this dance
Can it be yourself?
Can it be your smile?
Can it be the way you got me feeling all right?
Can it be your hugs? Or color of your eyes?
Cause boy, when I'm with you like I'm always surprise
(surprise, surprise, surprise) x2

(Sydney, Tatyana, Korin)
Is it yourself? Is it your laugh?
Is it the way you don't judge me by past?
Is it your smile?
Is it that you wild?
Tell me what is it?
What is it, tell me what is it?

(Korin)
Our talks on the phone
From night to day
Got me feeling
Some type of way
Walking in the halls
You're all over me
Walk in the class
Kiss me on the cheek
Is it the way you match my fly?
Could it be the way you make me smile?
Or when I'm mad, you calm me down
Or the fun we have when we clown around
Sometime boy, can figure it out?
No. I can't figure it out x2

To more than they're meant
Will play themselves out

Take this sinking boat and point it home
We've still got time
Raise your hopeful voice, you have a choice
You've made it now

Falling slowly, eyes that know me
And I can't go back

And I'm painted black

Well, you have suffered enough
And warred with yourself
It's time that you've won

425,Watching Airplanes,"Sittin out here on the hood of this truck looking up
At a caramel colored sunset sky
Checkin my watch doin the math in my head
Counting back words to when you said goodbye
Well those runway lights are gettin brighter

Im just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Take off and fly
Tryin to figure out which one you might be on
And why you dont love me anymore
Right now im sittin' out here watching airplanes

I would've lied could've cried should've tried harder
Done anything to make you stay
I wonder what you'd do if you looked out your window
Saw me runnin down the runway just like i was crazy
That fence is too high so am I

So I'm just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Take off and fly
Tryin to figure out which one you might be on
And why you don't love me anymore
By now I know you're thirty thousand feet above me
But a million miles away, a million miles away
By now I know I outta act like you don't love me

But im just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Take off and fly
Im just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Take off and fly
Tryin to figure out which one you might be on
And why you don't love me anymore

Yeah im just sittin' out here watching airplanes

...Man, whatever

[Intro]
Dre, just let it run
Ayo, turn the beat up a little bit
Ayo
This song is for anyone...
Fuck it, just shut up and listen
Ayo

[Verse 1]
I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zag's and this bag
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this... on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension, dispensin' these sentences
Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off
Of this chest and I rest again peacefully (Peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
To not come and speak to me (Speak to me), I don't know you
And no, I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me, my tank is on empty (Is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you ten feet (Liftin' you ten feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you (Of all you), I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be, it's just me

[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content
The song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses.""
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (Finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn (On Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at!
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city
Havin' this happenin' (This happenin') then attack
Eminem 'cause I rap this way (Rap this way) but I'm glad
'Cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire to burn
And it's burnin', and I have returned

[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 3]
I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top a ""My Name Is""
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (Got the patience)
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
Who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause I talk
With an accent and grab on my balls so they always
Keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (Fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (Drivin' me crazy), I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without
Someone standin' by it! (Standin' by it) No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

[Chorus]
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

To find me somewhere inside of you

And I'll take what remains of me

It grows dark but you don't mind
Hiding in the back streets, yeah, you'll never notice me
All that I was thinking about
Was cleaning up my conscience
Lost in the memory as it shakes up the corners of my heart
Was it my mistake?
Or maybe it was just as simple as a change in your heart

I can’t help but wait
Oh, I can’t help but wait
Check it out, uh

[Verse 1]
I see you, you're with him, he ain’t right but you don’t trip
You stand by while he lies then turn right round and forgive
I can’t take to see your face with those tears running down your cheeks
But what can I do? I gotta stay true 'cause deep down I’m still a G

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don’t wanna come between you and your man
Even though I know I treat you better than he can

[Chorus]
Girl, I can’t help but wait 'til you get that with him, it don’t change
Can’t help but wait 'til you see that with me it ain’t the same
Can’t help but wait 'til you see you for what you really are
Baby girl, you are a star and I can’t help but wait

[Verse 2]
It ain't fresh to just let him call the shots
You’re a queen, you should be getting all that someone’s got
You should be rocking the latest in purses, bracelets and watches
You’re worth much more than an occasional
'I love you, I’m thinking of you'

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don’t wanna come between you and your man, no
Even though I know I treat you better than he can

[Chorus]
Girl, I can’t help but wait 'til you get that with him, it don’t change

She said that money ain't worth nothin' if you can't treat me right
I clearly see bitches ain't shit, they just want see me cry
Young nigga rollin', keep that Glock 'cause shit ain't safe out at night
I say the money and betrayal got my mind hypnotized

[Verse 1]
Lies, that's what they told me
I never asked for shit at night, only for you to hold me
I did it out of love, baby, never said you owed me
Now I don't wanna fuck with you, it's gonna kill me slowly
Straight out that north, I made it out, don't mix me in the shit they say
My feelings fallin', money callin', how we movin', shit ain't safe
I'm roamin' through LA alone with a burner on my waist
At night, I pray I make it home, them pussy boys know where I stay, might jump the gate
But fuck that, I'm strapped up, ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Somethin' must be in them nigga's head wrong if they thinkin', I ain't clutchin'
Can't take cover when I start bustin'
Leave 'em like one said they love me
Patrol still wanna cuff me
No love for one, say fuck me
You supposed to be the one I run to, but you ain't 'round
Never knew to succumb to, I don't know how
I lost my love for that dream and I don't know if it could be found
You always bringin' some shit up, never once tried to put you down

[Chorus]
She said that money ain't worth nothin' if you can't treat me right
I clearly see bitches ain't shit, they just want see me cry
Young nigga rollin', keep that Glock 'cause shit ain't safe out at night
I say the money and betrayal got my mind hypnotized

[Verse 2]
One person I'm lovin'
Nobody I'm trustin'
Straight out of them trenches, I'm thuggin'
To me you the world, but I never could tell you wasn't keepin' it real
You was billing your budget
You see me with bitches you think that I cherish
You ask them a question, they can't tell you nothin'
Bad news and it's comin' out ugly
Truth be told, you was plottin' on somethin'
Money mean nothin' when you really love someone
How I be livin' take up time and we could have a one on one
And fuckin' off ain't that important when you really for someone
I'm scared to open up my heart, I always been so nonchalant
I just wanna live with you, build with you, smoke with you, yeah
I know you think the shit I say
But you just wanna misuse me and lie, said that I ain't never cared
You left yo' diary by the bed

[Chorus]
She said that money ain't worth nothin' if you can't treat me right

She's just sixteen years old
Leave her alone, they say
Separated by fools
Who don't know what love is yet
But I want you to know

[Hook]
If I could fly, I'd pick you up
I'd take you into the night
And show you a love
Like you've never seen, ever seen

[Verse 2]
It's like having a dream
Where nobody has a heart
It's like having it all
And watching it fall apart
And I would wait till the end of time for you
And do it again, it's true
I can't measure my love
There's nothing to compare it to
But I want you to know

[Hook]
If I could fly, I'd pick you up
I'd take you into the night

And she needs to give 'em a shot
Whatever they are

[Verse 2]
Looks like she's all ready to leave
Nothing left to pack
There ain't no room for me in that car
Even if she asked me to tag along
God I gotta be strong

[Chorus]
She's at the starting line of the rest of her life
As ready as she's ever been
Got the hunger and the stars in her eyes
The prize is hers to win
She's waiting on my blessings
Before she hits that open road
Baby, get ready
Get set
Don't go

[Verse 3]
She says things are fallen into place
Feels like they're fallen apart
I painted this big old smile on my face
To hide my broken heart
If only she knew
This is where I don't say what I want so bad to say
This is where I want to but I won't get in the way
Of her and her dreams
And spreading her wings

'Cause I like, I like, I like

[Verse 2: Timbaland]
I ain't got no Visa
I ain't got no Red American Express
We can't go nowhere exotic
It don't matter 'cause I'm the one that loves you best
Talk to me, girl

[Bridge: Keri Hilson]
Oh, baby, it's alright now, you ain't gotta flaunt for me
If we go Dutch, you can still touch, my love is free
We can work without the perks just you and me
Thug it out 'til we get it right

Baby, if you strip, you can get a tip

I don't need the G's or the car keys
Boy, I like you just the way you are
Let me see ya strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like you just the way you are

[Verse 3: John Doe/D.O.E]
Yeah, baby girl
I don't got a huge ol' house, I rent a room in a house
Listen baby girl
I ain't got a motorboat, but I can float ya boat
So listen baby girl
Once you get a dose of D.O.E., you gon' want some mo'
So listen baby girl
When I make it, I want you there, want you there, yeah

[Verse 4: Sebastian]
Yeah my money ain't aloof like Phil and them
And it's really not quite low as LSN
Your body ain't Pamela Anderson
It's a struggle just to get you in the caravan
But listen baby girl
Before I let you lose a pound, I'll buy a bigger car
So listen baby girl
I love you just the way you are, the way you are

[Bridge: Keri Hilson]
Oh, baby, it's all right, now you ain't gotta flaunt for me
If we go dutch, you can still touch my love, it's free
We can work without the perks, just you and me
Thug it out till we get it right

[Chorus: Keri Hilson & (Timbaland)]
Baby, if you strip, you could get a tip
'Cause I like you just the way you are
I'm about to strip and I'm well equipped

441,Fake It,"[Intro]
And I don't think that that's a selfish want, I really don't. I'm not saying that I have this capacity because it's hard to develop that capacity on your own, when you're being stopped at every turn

[Verse 1]
Drive around, night time, nowhere to go
Melt me down, I'm like wax to your jokes
Lost and found, knocking heads, laying low
And there's no point reliving crimes to lose this

[Pre-Chorus]
Still wanna waste all of my time
I wanna waste all of my time
Still wanna waste all of my time
I wanna waste all of my time
With you

[Chorus]
Oh my lover, my lover, my love
We can never go back
We can only do our best to recreate
Don't turn over, turn over the page
We should rip it straight out
Then let's try our very best to fake it

[Verse 2]
Show me joy, flower through disarray
Let's destroy, each mistake that we made
Then restore the color back to the grey
There's no pride in sharing scars to prove it

[Pre-Chorus]
Still wanna waste all of my time
I wanna waste all of my time
Still wanna waste all of my time
I wanna waste all of my time
With you

[Chorus]
Oh my lover, my lover, my love
We can never go back
We can only do our best to recreate
Don't turn over, turn over the page
We should rip it straight out
Then let's try our very best to fake it

[Bridge]
Help me turn a blind eye
Days and nights we lost to weakness
Help me turn a blind eye
Days and nights we lost to weakness

[Chorus]
Oh my lover, my lover, my love
We can never go back
We can only do our best to recreate
Don't turn over, turn over the page
We should rip it straight out
Then let's do our very best to fake it
Oh my lover, my lover, my love
We can never go back
We can only do our best to recreate
Don't turn over, turn over the page
We should rip it straight out

442,The Prayer (Live),"I pray you'll be our eyes, and watch us where we go
And help us to be wise, in times when we don't know
Let this be our prayer, as we go our way
Lead us to a place, guide us with your grace
To a place where we'll be safe...

La luce che tu dai
I pray we'll find your light
Nel cuore resterà
And hold it in our hearts
A ricordarci che
When stars go out each night
L'eterna stella sei

Nella mia preghiera
Let this be our prayer
Quanta fede c'è

When shadows fill our day
Lead us to a place
Guide us with your grace
Give us faith so we'll be safe

Sognamo un mondo senza più violenza
Un mondo di giustizia e di speranza
Ognuno di la mano al suo vicino
Simbolo di pace e di fraternità

La forza che ci dai
We ask that life be kind

È il desiderio che
And watch us from above

Ognuno trovi amor
We hope each soul will find

Hai acceso in noi

443,You Know I'm No Good,"[Verse 1]
Meet you downstairs, in the bar and hurt
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say ""What did you do with him today?""
And sniffed me out like I was Tanqueray
'Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear men down like Roger Moore

[Chorus]
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

[Verse 2]
Upstairs in bed with my ex-boy
He's in the place but I can't get joy
Thinking on you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes
Run out to meet you, chips and pitta
You say, ""When we married""
'cause you're not bitter
""There'll be none of him no more""
I cried for you on the kitchen floor

[Chorus]
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

[Verse 3]
Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub, you on the seat
Lick your lips as I soap my feet
Then you notice likkle carpet burn
My stomach drops and my guts churn
You shrug and it's the worst
To truly stuck the knife in first

[Chorus]
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good",Amy Winehouse,2008,[77],1
444,What Do Ya Think About That,"I heard it through the grapevine
My new neighbor don't like my big red barn
A '47 Ford, bullet holes in the door
Broke down motor in the front yard
I got half a mind to paint a plywood sign
And nail it up on a knotty pine tree
Saying I was here first
This is my piece of dirt
And your rambling don't rattle me

Some people care about what other people think
Worry about what they say
Let a little gossip
Coming from a loose lip ruin a perfect day
Saying blah, blah, blah, just a jacking their jaws
Gotta let it roll off-a my back
I don't give a dern what other people think
What do ya think about that

I wear what I want to, overalls, work boots
Crank my music up loud
Like to sling a little mud in my four wheel drive
Trek it all into town

Shot a little eight ball down at the pool hall
Drink a beer with my friends
Now don't judge me and I won't judge you
Cause we all get judged in the end

Some people care about what other people think
Worry about what they say
Let a little gossip
Coming from a loose lip ruin a perfect day
Saying blah, blah, blah, just a jacking their jaws
Gotta let it roll off-a my back
I don't give a dern what other people think
What do ya think about that

Some people care about what other people think

445,I'll Be Waiting,"We don't belong
Making ladders out of cardboard sheets
We will be gone
While we're counting stars, they're counting sheep

Peter, hold your breath; don't make a sound
Just keep running, and keep running, and keep running
In our heads, we're ten feet off the ground
Just keep running, and keep running
(Keep running, keep running, keep running)

You know that place between asleep and awake
Where you can still remember dreams
That's where I'll always love you
You know that place between asleep and awake
Where you can still remember dreams
That's where I'll always love you
And that's where I'll be waiting

That's where I'll be waiting
That's where I'll be waiting

Feeling alone
Never thought I'd see this place again
I'm growing old
In a different world, you stay the same
(Same, same, same)

I just hold my breath; don't make a sound
I'm running, I keep running, I keep running
Cause I can't see you quite as clearly now
I'm running, I keep running, I keep running

You know that place between asleep and awake
Where you can still remember dreams
That's where I'll always love you

446,Who Knew,"[Intro]
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I'd) Mic check, one-two
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I'd) Who would've knew?
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I'd) Who would've known?
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I'd) Fuck would've thought?
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I'd) Motherfucker comes out
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I'd) Sells a couple of million records
(I never knew I, knew I, knew I'd)
And these motherfuckers hit the ceiling

[Verse 1]
I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I make fight music for high school kids
I put lives at risk when I drive like this
I put wives at risk with a knife like this
Shit, you probably think I'm in your tape deck now
I'm in the back seat of your truck with duct tape stretched out
Ducked the fuck way down, waitin' to straight jump out
Put it over your mouth, and grab you by the face — what now?
Oh, you want me to watch my mouth
How? Take my fuckin' eyeballs out and turn them around?
Look, I'll burn your fuckin' house down, circle around
And hit the hydrant, so you can't put your burnin' furniture out
I'm sorry, there must be a mix-up
You want me to fix up lyrics
While our President gets his dick sucked?
Fuck that! Take drugs, rape sluts
Make fun of gay clubs, men who wear make-up
Get aware, wake up, get a sense of humor
Quit tryin' to censor music
This is for your kid's amusement (the kids!)
But don't blame me when little Eric jumps off of the terrace
You shoulda been watchin' him, apparently you ain't parents

[Chorus]
‘Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch

[Verse 2]
So who's bringin' the guns in this country?
I couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun
Through customs over in London
And last week I seen this Schwarzenegger movie
Where he's shootin' all sorts of these motherfuckers with an Uzi
I see these three little kids up in the front row
Screaming ""Go!"" with their 17-year-old uncle
I'm like, guidance?!
Ain't they got the same moms and dads
Who got mad when I asked if they liked violence?
And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear?
What about the make-up
You allow your 12-year-old daughter to wear?
So tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words
When his bus driver's screamin' at him, fuckin' him up worse
(Go sit the fuck down, you little fucking prick!)
And ""fuck"" was the first word I ever learned
Up in the third grade, flippin' the gym teacher the bird (Look!)
So read up 'bout how I used to get beat up
Peed on, be on free lunch
And changed school every three months
My life's like kind of what my wife's like (What?)
Fucked up after I beat her fuckin' ass every night: Ike
So how much easier would life be
If nineteen million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?

[Chorus]
‘Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch

[Verse 3]
I never knew I, knew I'd have a new house or a new car
A couple years ago I was more poorer than you are
I don't got that bad of a mouth, do I?
Fuck! Shit! Ass! Bitch! Cunt! Shooby-de-doo-wop! (Oops)
Skibbedy-be-bop, a Christopher Reeves
Sonny Bono, skis, horses and hittin' some trees (Hey)
How many retards'll listen to me
And run up in the school shootin' when they're pissed at a tea
-cher? Her? Him? Is it you? Is it them?
""Wasn't me, Slim Shady said to do it again!""
Damn, how much damage can you do with a pen?
Man, I'm just as fucked up as you woulda been
If you woulda been in my shoes, who woulda thought
Slim Shady would be somethin' that you woulda bought?
That woulda made you get a gun and shoot at a cop
I just said it, I ain't know if you'd do it or not

[Chorus]
‘Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch

Hit that, hit that snare

[Verse 1]
I'm in the business of misery, let's take it from the top
She's got a body like an hourglass, it's ticking like a clock
It's a matter of time before we all run out
When I thought he was mine, she caught him by the mouth
I waited eight long months, she finally set him free
I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me
Two weeks and we caught on fire
She's got it out for me, but I wear the biggest smile

[Chorus]
Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him now
And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

[Verse 2]
Second chances, they don't ever matter, people never change
Once a whore you're nothing more
I'm sorry, that'll never change
And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged
I'm sorry honey, but I passed it up, now look this way
Well, there's a million other girls who do it just like you
Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
They want and what they like
It's easy if you do it right
Well I refuse, I refuse, I refuse!

[Chorus]
Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him right now
And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

I watched his wildest dreams come true
And not one of them involving you
Just watch my wildest dreams come true
Not one of them involving

Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now

Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now

Fuck what she sayin', she want a ring

See if I can do without reading

[Verse 1: Larry Lovestein]
Loving is what I can give to you
So tell me you love me, cause I know you do
Every night you go to sleep
Tell me am I on your mind?
We could be sleeping in the streets
But if I'm with you I feel so fine
In the morning you'll be gone and it all goes away
Tell me that you gotta leave, but I know you wanna stay
Deep within your conscious, the place that I reside
Running out of options, baby, you be wasting all my time
It gets a little crowded, all the things running through my mind
Maybe I'll be able to tell you one day, hopefully soon
Last night we were high, floating over the moon
Smoking with you, I'm smoking with you

Life's what you make it
Wear my heart out on my sleeve
Baby, you my favorite
Sorry if I'm staring

If love is a feeling that got you afraid
Maybe it's time to start walking away
Your beauty like something I saw in a painting: amazing
The world never seen something like you
Every morning that I wake up, wish you were laying next to me
Tell me what you're made of, girl, say what you believe
Sleeping with somebody else, tell me what I'm missing
I see it all in your face, you're such a politician
And these days we ain't talking as much as we used to
You miss me, but shit keeps spiraling out of control
But we changed into two different people, I noticed
I miss you, continue to slowly lose you, I know

If it takes me all night long, I'm gonna get my drink on

Well I got some little problems and the only way to solve 'em is the sure-fire way I know
And when the going gets tough, well the tough get going to the little bar down the road

Or a seat a table with a jug of black label when a 12-pack won't quite do

451,Shoulda Let You Go,"[Intro: Keyshia Cole]
Just to think about it, I would do things that I would regret (tryna get you to)
To understand how I felt for you
I tried real hard time and time again
But I didn't know
My love wouldn't grow, I should've just let it go
But I stayed around thinking you would learn to love

[Hook: Keyshia Cole]
And we both knew, you're wrong
There's nothing you can do, to ever undo what you've done to me
I loved you, deep in my heart I know you couldn't love me
But baby I just kept holding on, I should've let you go
Should've let you go
Should've let you go
Should've let you go

[Verse 1: Keyshia Cole]
Couldn't do without it, I felt I needed you in my world (to get me by, by)
More and more I looked out for you, tried to play me like a fool so I
Didn't care that love wasn't there, had to just let it go
Couldn't stay around, thinking you would learn to love

[Hook: Keyshia Cole]

[Verse 2: Amina]
And now I'm gone, plus I'd rather be alone
We both grown, lower your tone over the phone, aaight
I should've known, damn I should've known
It wouldn't last long, when you didn't come home some nights
And now I'm on, in the zone, handle business on my own
So respect the queen on the throne, aaight
Here's some strong advice, move on, that's life
You're wrong, I'm right, and I'm glad I let you go

Don't know why you would ever lie to me so
But I should've let you
Don't know why I could never let you go
Could've, should've, let you

452,Pictures Of You,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I've been looking so long at these pictures of you
That I almost believe that they're real
I've been living so long with my pictures of you
That I almost believe that the pictures are
All I can feel

[Verse 2]
Remembering you
Standing quiet in the rain
As I ran to your heart to be near
And we kissed as the sky fell in
Holding you close
How I always held close in your fear
Remembering you
Running soft through the night
You were bigger and brighter and wider than snow
And screamed at the make-believe
Screamed at the sky
And you finally found all your courage
To let it all go

[Verse 3]
Remembering you
Fallen into my arms
Crying for the death of your heart
You were stone white
So delicate
Lost in the cold
You were always so lost in the dark
Remembering you
How you used to be
Slow drowned
You were angels
So much more than everything
Hold for the last time then slip away quietly
Open my eyes
But I never see anything

[Bridge]
If only I'd thought of the right words
I could have held on to your heart
If only I'd thought of the right words
I wouldn't be breaking apart
All my pictures of you

[Verse 4]
Looking so long at these pictures of you
But I never hold on to your heart
Looking so long for the words to be true
But always just breaking apart
My pictures of you

[Outro]
There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more
Than to feel you deep in my heart
There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more
Than to never feel the breaking apart

[Verse 1 - Akon]
I met her on the walk way
Staring as she walked pass
She looked back at me sideways and said
I can't help but to ask
I said, ""You want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something""
We end up going back to her place
Wish I could tell you what I saw
The sexiest women in a negligee
We hit it off until the morning
You heard her say

[Verse 2: Akon]
Billie Jean is always talking when nobody else is talking
Telling lies and rubbing shoulders
So they called her mouth a motor
Someone's always trying to start my baby crying
Talking, squealing, lying
Saying you just want to be starting something

[Chorus - Akon]
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something

[Verse 3: Michael Jackson]
You love to pretend that you're good
When you're always up to no good
You really can't make him hate her
So your tongue became a razor
Someone's always trying to start my baby crying
Talking, Squealing, lying
You got my baby crying

I said you want to be starting something

It's getting a little crazy (It's getting a little crazy)
Always messing with my baby (messing with my baby)
And that's the reason she cries
When I am not by her side
I have the loneliest night (without my baby)

Always pop up when I'm thinking about you

Okay now picture little Bobby just a youngin' runnin' round
With his mans, hammer in his hands, feelin' like the man
Run, mothafucka, run
Before the popo get the gun, put it to your brain like goddamn!
Everybody know you ain't about it
Everything you talk about I know I can live without it
Red light, stop. Green light, go!
Everything ain't what it seem like
Mothafucka I know!
Hold up, what you mean, where you been?
Bitch, I been in
This is merely the beginning again
What you been living in?
A box, under the bridge, like Anthony Kiedis?
Looking for something to complete us
And maybe lead us, fuck an elitist
Hell of a long way from equal is how they treat us
Body of a builder with the mind of a fetus
Turn on the television and see the vision they feed us
And I wish I could erase that, face facts

God as my witness, I'm with this
But on the real, I think I need another witness!
If it was 1717, black daddy, white momma wouldn't change a thing
Light skin mothafucka certified as a house nigga
Well I'll be God damned, go figure
In my blood is the slave and the master
It's like the devil playin' spades with the pastor
But he was born with the white privilege!
Man, what the fuck is that?
White people told me as a child, as a little boy, playin' with his toys
I should be ashamed to be black
And some black people look ashamed when I rap
Like my great granddaddy didn’t take a whip to the back
Not accepted by the black or the white
I don't give a fuck, praise God, I could see the light
Everybody talkin' 'bout race this, race that

Summer der Hammer
Trip

[Part 1: MoTrip]
Es geht von Aachen nach oben, komm mit auf den Trip
Ich starte die Show, es geht nicht mehr zurück
Ich erwarte jetzt schon seit paar Jahre die Kohle
Die Frage ist: Wo gibt es sickeren Shit?
Der sagenumwobene Spitter, ich fick
Alles da, wo du wohnst und bin sicher, es gibt
Keine dickeren Hits auf der Straße, ich flow nicht
Ich schlage mich durch und bin fitter als fit
Der Name ist Mo, immer noch Trip
Keine Statussymbole, kein Gitter, kein nix
Ich gab damals ja schon nur ein' Fick auf das Biz
Denn ich ahnte da schon, wie verbittert es ist
Alles besitzen und später allein in der
Falle zu sitzen ist nicht so mein Ding
Am Ende vom Tag ist nicht alles beschissen
Ich mache mein Business und krieg' das schon hin
Die Idioten begegnen mir neuerdings nicht mal
Mehr ohne Benehm' oder ohne ""Wie geht’s dir?""
Alle sagen: ""Ich bin froh, dich zu sehen
Du bist Mo zu dem T, deine Krone, sie steht dir""
Kurz überlegen, ah, jeder Part bringt den
Boden zum Beben wie große Kometen
Doch ohne Moneten bin ich leider nicht in der
Lage, dir weiterhin Strophen zu geben, so ist das Leben
Komische Gegend, dunkel im Zimmer, die Hände - erfror'n
Der Junge - schon immer zum Kämpfen gebor'n
Hier schlummert noch immer unendlicher Zorn
Ich änder' die Norm und liefer' euch Rap in vollendeter Form
Ich verrenke die Worte so heftig, dass Rapper schon denken
Ich morde, ich frage mich: Wann komm' ich endlich nach vorn?

[Hook: MoTrip, Summer Cem]
Ich bin immer noch hier, will immer noch hoch
Ich kämpfe dafür, doch bin immer noch broke
Die Leute in Aachen sind freundlich, doch raten mir:
""Such' dir ein' Job mit 'nem sicheren Lohn""
Gesagt, getan, ich hab den Plan im Kopf und hoff', es ändert sich fix
Ich warte, (warte,) warte, (warte,) warte, doch es ändert sich nix
Ich bin immer noch hier, (will immer noch hoch
Ich kämpfe dafür, doch bin immer noch broke
Die Leute in Rheidt sind freundlich, doch schreien:
""Such dir 'nen Job mit 'nem sicheren Lohn!""
Gesagt, getan, ich hab den Plan im Kopf und hoff', es ändert sich fix
Ich warte,) warte, (warte,) warte, (warte, doch es ändert sich nix
Ich bin immer noch hier)

[Part 2: Summer Cem]
Sie nennen mich Summer, der Hammer, der Killer, der Chief
Mein innerer Trieb sagt, hol' die Kanone, lad durch und ich schieß
Kille den Beat wie keiner zuvor, es geht einfach in's Ohr
Und dein dreifaches „Boah, Boah, Boah“ wäre mal langsam angebracht
Ich hol' das Paket aus dem Handschuhfach
Und geb' es dem Kollegen Tanju ab
Strictly Business, ficke die Bitches
Seh, dass am Ende des Tunnels ein Licht ist
Jeder, der hatet, geht weg und verpisst sich
Mitten im Leben, doch darauf verzicht' ich
Jeder, der mir krumm kommt, lässt mir keine Wahl
Eck- und Schneidezahn weg mit einem Schlag
Scheiß drauf, was die Rap-Gemeinde sagt
Sogar Hater kommen nicht weg von meinen Parts
Motherfucker, du weißt wer hier rappt
Schepper deine Crew und die Leibwächter weg
Komm' in deine Gegend mit Rheydt-Wester Reds
Damit du Hundesohn den Neid besser lässt
Schaue dir die Szene an: zu viele Schmocks
Doch irgendwann landen die Kugeln im Kopf
Junge, denk einmal nach, keiner gibt dir noch Props
Hör auf mit dem Rap und such dir ‘n Job
Guck mal, frag selbst
Ich bin keiner der Typen, die meinen zu pöbeln
Nur weil man sich jetzt für'n Star hält
Ich komme für Bargeld: Para, Money, Kies und so
Typisch Cem, typisch Mo, nie wieder auf Miete wohn'
Junge, du siehst hungrig aus, geh dir mal ‘ne Bifi hol'n

458,Through The Fire And Flames,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
On a cold winter morning
In the time before the light
In flames of Death's eternal reign
We ride towards the fight
When the darkness has fallen down
And the times are tough, alright
The sound of evil laughter falls
Around the world tonight
Fighting hard, fighting on for the steel
Through the wastelands evermore
The scattered souls will feel the hell
Bodies wasted on the shores
On the blackest plains in hell's domain
We watch them as they go
In fire and pain, now once again, we know
So now we fly ever free
We're free before the thunderstorm
On towards the wilderness our quest carries on
Far beyond the sundown
Far beyond the moonlight
Deep inside our hearts and all our souls

[Chorus]
So far away we wait for the day-ay
For the lives all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames we carry on

[Short Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
As the red day is dawning
And the lightning cracks the sky
They'll raise their hands to the heavens above
With resentment in their eyes
Running back through the mid-morning light
There's a burning in my heart
We're banished from a time in a fallen land
To a life beyond the stars
In your darkest dreams, see to believe
Our destiny this time
And endlessly we'll all be free tonight
And on the wings of a dream, so far beyond reality
All alone in desperation, now the time has gone
Lost inside you'll never find, lost within my own mind
Day after day this misery must go on

[Chorus]
So far away we wait for the day-ay
For the lives all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames we carry on

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Now here we stand with their blood on our hands
We fought so hard now can we understand?
I'll break the seal of this curse if I possibly can
For freedom of every man

[Chorus]
So far away we wait for the day-ay
For the lives all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames we carry on

Working hard to find the things she mentioned
He was dedicated, by most suckers hated
That girl was fine, but she didn't appreciate him

Stop what you're doing, you don't want to ruin
The chance that you got to find a new one

461,How Far We've Come,"[Intro]
Hello, hello, hello

[Verse 1]
I'm waking up at the start of the end of the world
But its feeling just like every other morning before
Now I wonder what my life is going to mean if it's gone
The cars are moving like a half a mile an hour at that
I started staring at the passengers who're waving goodbye
Can you tell me what was ever really special about me all this time?

[Chorus]
But I believe the world is burning to the ground
Oh well, I guess we're gonna find out
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come
Well I, believe, it all, is coming to an end
Oh well, I guess, we're gonna pretend
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come

[Verse 2]
I think it turned ten o'clock but I don't really know
Then I can't remember caring for an hour or so
Started crying and I couldn't stop myself
I started running but there's no where to run to
I sat down on the street and took a look at myself
Said where you going man you know the world is headed for hell
Say your goodbyes if you've got someone you can say goodbye to

[Chorus]
I believe the world is burning to the ground
Oh well, I guess we're gonna find out
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come
Well I, believe, it all, is coming to an end
Oh well, I guess, we're gonna pretend
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come

[Verse 3]
It's gone, gone, baby its all gone
There is no one on the corner and there's no one at home
It was cool, cool, it was just all cool
Now it's over for me, and it's over for you
Well its gone, gone, baby its all gone
There is no one on the corner and there's no one at home
Well it was cool, cool, it was just all cool
Now it's over for me, and it's over for you

[Chorus]
I believe the world is burning to the ground
Oh well, I guess we're gonna find out
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come

Oh well, I guess, we're gonna pretend

I can't get over you
Can’t get over you
And before I die I pray that
I could be the one
That I could be the one
But I won't be no fun
If I can't have you, no one can

[Verse]
Highlights, in the limelight
Can you show me, to the nightlife
Baby I like, all colors like
But I want you, and I don’t know right (Don't know right)
Tell me more, I got a box cutter with your name on it
Tell me more, I can't stay this long on the same topic
I don't know you, but would I fall in love with you?
I don't have no social cues
I'm all for you (Ayy)

[Chorus]
I can't get over you (Ooh, yeah, ooh, ooh)
Can't get over you
And before I die I pray (Yup) that

DJ Khaled! We the best
Who? We nigga! We the best
This the remix, the I'm So Hood remix
I'm makin' movies
I'm So Hood remix!

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm so hood! Yeah, I wear my pants below my waist
And I never dance when I'm in this place
'Cause you and your man is plannin' to hate
I'm so hood! And I got these golds up in my mouth
If you get closer to my house, then you know what I'm talkin' 'bout
I'm out the hood! And if you feel me, put your hands up
Hood! My hood niggas, can you stand up?
I'm so hood! If you not from here you can walk it out
And you not hood if you don't know what I'm talkin' 'bout
I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm so hood!

[DJ Khaled over Chorus]
We always gonna be the best, man
We run this, man
I make hit records, man, this is what I do
I'm out the… this the remix
Put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up
I gave you ""We Takin' Over"" (yo Khaled)
Ayo, Jeezy (I got 'em, homie)
You got me? We run this, man, we run this!

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
I'm so H to the double-O D
Walk around there's goddamn money on me
Pockets so fat it don't make no sense
Whips so clean don't need no tints
Watch so bright don't need no light
You know where it were don't need no mic
Niggas like, ""Young, what you get for your show?""
Tell 'em same thing I used to get for the blow
Set 'em on the raw, nigga, what I got to lose?
Put 'em in the Vans, I ain't talkin' 'bout the shoes
Do the speed limit, watch out for the lights
Pussy-ass niggas, gotta watch out for the dykes
Seventeen five, yeah nigga, I said it
Seventeen five, yeah nigga, I meant it
And when we do it bad, but I'm doin' good
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so motherfuckin' (hood!)

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Everybody come equipped with bangers
Throwin' up our middle fingers
And you know I don't slip
So I gotta keep ten in the clip and one in the chamber
Better be walkin' with angels
And never take candy from strangers
Through the stress and strife
Had to earn my stripes like I played with the Bengals
I'm in the zone, holmes, goin' for the two-point conversion
I'm so hood that Ludacris shoulda been on the original version
But this is the remix, with the cheap tricks, hittin' sweet licks
And I cut the braids off
But the waves and the fade'll make you sea-sick
See this is the way that we ball
And this is the way that we brawl
So put a fist in the air if you care
That united we stand and divided we fall
When the South's in the house, better watch your mouth
'Cause we on that hood shit
I'm hood rich, comin' around your hood, bitch, I swear I'm so—

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm out the hood! And if you feel me, put your hands up
Hood! My hood niggas, can you stand up?
I'm so hood! If you not from here you can walk it out
And you not hood if you don't know what I'm talkin' 'bout
I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm so hood!

[Busta Rhymes over Chorus]
Khaled, they actin' like we ain't
The kings of the streets and the gods of the hood
Busta Bust, bitches!

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
See all I know is how to go and get my money g-gain and again
Top down, let the money blow in the wind
With a bad bitch sittin' in the passenger seat
With a doobie-wrapped head full of bobbie pins
You know I keep that thang when I walk
See the dialect different from the slang in my talk
Baby still leavin', got a crackhead frontin'
Got another bad bitch that'll boost for the spark
I'm used to leavin' the strip last
Hustlin' until the sun comes up gettin' cash
So much bread in all of my four pockets
It look like a nigga got hips with an ass
And from the DNA in my blood
Niggas idolize me and try to do what I does
And if that other nigga ain't really from the hood
You can easily die, take who that fake nigga was
And even though I spit a little rap
Got niggas in the hood try to sell the most crack
Violator, I send a nigga to do it just to make you spend a lot of money just to get your shit back
Y'all niggas know where I'm from
And I rep it to the fullest 'til the day that I'm done
So hood where we live, if a nigga sold drugs
And he rich Momma still proud of her son

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Daddy Fat Sacks so hood like a Cadillac ornament
On from the Baby-lon
Call an ambulance to come and pick that ass up
'Cause the nigga never had the chance
They try to dance with the devil in a pale moonlight,
Advance on a level that they can't do right
Lay hands on a fella like a man in blue lights
Whoop, whoop! Do it twice!
Your boy the B-I-G
I'm nicer than MC on your top three
You cocky, I cock, squeeze
Bust them things, now you sloppy
Speed it up, slow it down then screw it
Don't bite the flow 'cause I got that fluid
Run through the crew on some whole other new shit
Newness, bitch, we do this

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm out the hood! And if you feel me, put your hands up
Hood! My hood niggas, can you stand up?
I'm so hood! If you not from here you can walk it out
And you not hood if you don't know what I'm talkin' 'bout
I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm so hood! (Alright… Weezy)

[Verse 5: Lil Wayne]
I'm so Hollygrove, New Orleans, Lil Weezy-ana
Home sweet Home De-pot, you will need a hammer
It go down like Frasier, I ain't talkin' Kelsey Grammer
I be shittin' on you boys, I need an Alka-Seltzer sandwich (HOOD)
Since I heard Plies I done bought the Phantom back
Went and got me a fifty-two inch Maybach
I'm eatin' like a big dog, I'm so full
I'm so good, I'm so straight, you so fake, I'm so real, I'm so (hood!)
(Coca, ghetto gatka, haha
Yup, crack, crack, crack, cr-cr-cr-cr)

[Verse 6: Fat Joe]
Yeah nigga, welcome to the Crackhouse
I should own a McDonald's the way I bring the MAC's out
I'm from the hood where every nigga lies
Flip a couple grams they tell you they bakin' pies
Shit, still got my name carved in that central bookin'
Gave that pussy a scar and told her good lookin'
You's a crack baby, that means your momma paid me
You can't even blame me, that's what the hood made me

[Verse 7: Birdman]
Martin Luther King, Calliope, Magnolia, Melphamine
Gettin' that money with the triple beam
See ride of Clyde your Josephine
Saints is my team, that's what we breathe nigga
That's how we eat, get this money on the streets nigga
VL my street, blood – five star G, blood
Fly as a bird, got these Eagles on my seat, blood
Then hit back where I stay, Third Ward we get that cake
Thirteen is where I lay, shouts out to MIA

[Verse 8: Rick Ross]
Mo' money, mo' problems, don't call me conceited
Just call me the boss, always got what you needed
MIA oh so hot but my neck got the fever
If you sneeze you get shot, gunplay makin' believers
I just bought me a ranch, watch the hundreds stacks
No, those ain't Rolex diamonds, what you done to that?

We might not ought to take a roll in the hay
Cause we'd burn the barn down one of these days
We're a match made in heaven and it ain't no joke

She's a firecracker, she's the light of my life

[Verse 3]
She goes off with a great big bang
Boys, I tell yea it's a beautiful thing
She takes off, you better hang on tight

469,Don't Blink,"[Verse 1]
I turned on the evening news
Saw a old man being interviewed
Turning a hundred and two today
Asked him what's the secret to life
He looked up from his old pipe
Laughed and said ""All I can say is.""

[Chorus]
Don't blink
Just like that you're six years old and you take a nap and you
Wake up and you're twenty-five and your high school sweetheart becomes your wife
Don't blink
You just might miss your babies growing like mine did
Turning into moms and dads next thing you know your better half
Of fifty years is there in bed
And you're praying God takes you instead
Trust me friend a hundred years goes faster than you think
So don't blink

[Verse 2]
I was glued to my TV when it looked like he looked at me and said
""Best start putting first things first.""
'Cause when your hourglass runs out of sand
You can't flip it over and start again
Take every breathe God gives you for what it's worth

[Chorus]
Don't blink
Just like that you're six years old and you take a nap and you
Wake up and you're twenty-five and your high school sweetheart becomes your wife
Don't blink
You just might miss your babies growing like mine did
Turning into moms and dads next thing you know your better half
Of fifty years is there in bed
And you're praying God takes you instead
Trust me friend a hundred years goes faster than you think
So don't blink

So I've been tryna slow it down
I've been tryna take it in
In this here today gone tomorrow world we're livin' in

[Chorus]
Don't blink

Wake up and you're twenty-five and your high school sweetheart becomes your wife
Don't blink
You just might miss your babies growing like mine did

Of fifty years is there in bed
And you're praying God takes you instead

And Chi-town via Bangor, Maine
Think I've seen it all, and all I can say is

How 'bout them cowgirls?

Sure are some proud girls
And you can't tell them nothing
And I tell you right now, girls
May just be seven wonders
Of this big, old round world
But how 'bout them cowgirls?

[Verse 2]
She's a-ridin' colts in Steamboat Springs
Bailing hay outside Abilene
She's trying hard to fit in in some city
But her home is 'neath that big, blue sky
And the Northern Plains and those other wide
Open spaces, nowadays, there ain't as many

[Chorus]
How 'bout them cowgirls?
Boys, ain't they something?
Sure are some proud girls
And you can't tell them nothing
And I tell you right now, girls
May just be seven wonders

But how 'bout them cowgirls?

[Bridge]
Boy, she don't need you and she don't need me
She can do just fine on her own two feet
But she wants a man who wants her to be herself
And she'll never change, don't know how to hide
Her stubborn will or her fighting side
But you treat her right and she'll love you like no one else

[Chorus]
Yeah, how 'bout them cowgirls?
Boys, ain't they something?
Sure are some proud girls
But you can't beat their loving
And I tell you right now, girls

474,Girls In Their Summer Clothes,"Well the street lights shine
Down on Blessing Avenue
Lovers they walk by
Holding hands two by two
A breeze crosses a porch
Bicycle spokes spin 'round
Jacket's on, I'm out the door
Tonight I'm going to burn this town down
And the girls in their summer clothes
In the cool of the evening light
The girls in their summer clothes
Pass me by
A kid's rubber ball smacks
Off the gutter 'neath the lamp light
Big bank clock chimes
Off goes the sleepy front porch lights
Downtown the store's alive
As the evening's underway
Things been a little tight
But I know they're gonna turn my way
And the girls in their summer clothes
In the cool of the evening light
The girls in their summer clothes
Pass me by
Frankie's Diner
Over on the edge of town
Neon sign spinnin' round
Like a cross over the lost and found
Fluorescent lights
Flicker above Bob's Grill
Shaniqua brings a coffee and asks ""fill?""
And says ""penny for your thoughts now my poor Bill""
She went away
She cut me like a knife
I had a beautiful thing
Maybe you just saved my life
And in just a glance
Down here on Magic Street
Love's a fool's dance
I ain't got much sense but I still got my feet
And the girls in their summer clothes
In the cool of the evening light
The girls in their summer clothes
Pass me by
And the girls in their summer clothes
In the cool of the evening light
The girls in their summer clothes
Pass me by",Doc Walker,2008,[95],1

479,Witch Doctor (2007),"15. The Curse of the Colonel
Origin: A statue of Colonel Sanders was thrown into a canal
Teams/people involved: Hanshin Tigers
Year started: 1985

If Colonel Sanders seems like a strange impetus for a curse, well, that's because he is. However, many fans of the Japanese baseball team, the Hanshin Tigers, believed that the KFC mascot was responsible for all their bad luck in the Japanese baseball leagues. Why? During celebrations following the team's 1985 Japan Series victory, a statue of Colonel Sanders was thrown into a canal at the Ebisubashi Bridge. For 18 years after that event, the team finished last or second-to-last in all but two seasons.

While the Tigers did manage to win the Central League title in 2003, they lost the Japan Series that year, effectively maintaining the curse. However, after years of repeated efforts to recover the statue, the figure was finally found in 2009 and brought up from the depths of the canal. But whether the Colonel's resurrection will have any impact on the team's fortunes remains to be seen.

14. The Andretti Curse
Origin: Mario Andretti's first Indy 500 win
Teams/people involved: The Andretti racing family
Year started: 1969

Racing-wise, 1969 was a good year for Mario Andretti, as the young racing legend managed to snag his first Indianapolis 500 title. However, it would end up being the only Indy win of his career. And not just for himself, but for his entire racing lineage. While the subsequent Andrettis (Michael, Jeff, Marco) all managed to have respectable racing careers, none were able to repeat the feat of their original racing ancestor. For whatever reason, bad luck often derailed any of Mario's efforts to win the title again, while his son Michael Andretti is essentially the Karl Malone of the Indianapolis 500, having completed and led the most laps out of any driver who never won the race.

The most heart-breaking of these losses had to occur in 2006, when Michael and his son Marco were both leading in the final laps of the race, only to be overtaken by Sam Hornish Jr., leaving the son-father duo to finish in second and third place, respectively. It was the only time in the history of the race that the winner has taken the lead in the final lap. Does it get much more heartbreaking than that?

13. The Curse of Coogan's Bluff
Origin: The Giants moved from New York to San Francisco
Teams/people involved: San Francisco Giants
Year started: 1957

When the San Francisco Giants moved away from New York in 1957, many believed that the team left all their good luck in the Big Apple. Coogan's Bluff refers to the site of their original ballpark in Harlem where the team had won five World Series titles, including the 1954 championship, which featured Willie Mays' unforgettable catch in Game 1.

However, when they went to the Bay Area, the team ended up losing three different World Series match-ups, including the 1989 series, which was delayed by the infamous Loma Prieta earthquake. It wasn't until 2010 that the team would finally break through again, following up their effort in 2012 to earn their second title in three years.

12. The Socceroos' Witch Doctor Curse
Origin: The Australian national soccer team failed to pay a witch doctor the money they owed him
Teams/people involved: The Australian national soccer team
Year started: 1970

Bringing voodoo or shamanism into any equation is usually the recipe for bad luck, and if you need any evidence, consider the case of the Australian national soccer team. In his 2002 autobiography, former Australian footballer Johnny Warren admitted that the team consulted a witch doctor in 1970 when they were facing Rhodesia in a World Cup qualifying match in Mozambique. Apparently, the witch doctor buried bones near the goal posts and placed a curse on Australia's opponent, leading the way for Australia's 3-1 victory.

However, when the witch doctor asked for payment, the team was unable to pay up, and was subsequently cursed by the witch doctor. After a lackluster 1974 World Cup appearance in which the team failed to score a single goal, the team failed to qualify for another World Cup until 2006. And why was the curse broken? An Australian filmmaker by the name of John Safran travelled to Mozambique and hired another witch doctor to reverse the original spell. Since then, Australia hasn't missed out on a single World Cup.

11. The Curse of Billy Penn
Origin: The statue of Billy Penn was surpassed as the highest point in Philadelphia
Teams/people involved: Philadelphia sports teams
Year started: 1987

Philadelphia sports teams have had to endure some serious heartbreak over the course of the past few decades, starting in 1987 after the construction of One Liberty Place, a structure that overtook the Philadelphia City Hall as the highest building in the city. Prior to One Liberty Place, a gentlemen's agreement had been in place to ensure that no building in the city would ever be higher than City Hall, upon which a statue of Philly founder William Penn sits.

However, when that agreement was broken, some believe that a curse came along with it. According to this belief, the Curse of Billy Penn caused the Flyers to lose the Stanley Cup twice, cost the Phillies the 1993 World Series, sunk the 76ers in the 2001 NBA Finals, and was responsible for the Eagles' Super Bowl XXXIX defeat.

But the city successfully reversed this curse in 2007 when workers constructing the Comcast Center (now the highest building in the city) attached a small statue of William Penn to the final beam of the building. With Billy now in his rightful position atop the city, Philadelphia was free to win again. And they did.

In 2008, the Phillies defeated the Tampa Bay Rays in 5 games to win their first World Series since 1980.

10. The Curse of the Bambino
Origin: Boston sells Babe Ruth to the Yankees
Teams/people involved: Boston Red Sox
Year started: 1918

Before Boston Red Sox owner Harry Frazee sold Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees, Boston had enjoyed unparalleled success in Major League Baseball, capturing the very first World Series title, as well as four others along the way. However, once Ruth was gone, their luck also seemed to change hands. It took 86 years before Boston could win another title, while their rival Yankees were able to scoop up 26 of their 27 World Series championships in that same span of time.

Previously, the Yankees had been nothing special as a franchise, but when Ruth came to town, they took off, becoming one of the most iconic sports franchises in the world. Meanwhile, what Boston lost in titles they made up for in a series of heartbreaking moments that are best remembered by names: Bucky Dent, Grady Little, and Bill Buckner. However, now that the Red Sox have managed to win three titles since 2004, you'll hardly find anyone who feels too badly for Boston.

9. The Curse of the Black Sox
Origin: The Black Sox scandal of 1919
Teams/people involved: The Chicago White Sox
Year started: 1919

Cheaters never prosper, and from 1919 to 2005, the Chicago White Sox were proof positive of that assertion, as the South Siders failed to win a World Series title in the wake of the 1919 Black Sox Scandal. As you may recall, the 1919 fiasco involved Sox star Shoeless Joe Jackson, as well as seven other teammates who were all responsible for throwing the 1919 World Series against the Cincinnati Reds in exchange for money.

Though the team would win the AL pennant in 1959, they fell to the Dodgers in the 1959 World Series, and wouldn't appear in it again until 2005. Thankfully, when the Sox made it back, they made it count, sweeping the Astros away as well as anymore bad memories associated with Shoeless Joe.

8. The Talladega Jinx
Origin: A Native American shaman placed a curse on the track
Teams/people involved: Various drivers at Talladega Superspeedway
Year started: 1973

Talladega Superspeedway is a track that is known for its fast races, fiery crashes, and strange stories. Since it was built in 1969, a number of odd occurrences have taken place that suggest some spooky common thread.

For instance, in 1973, racer Bobby Isaac got out of his car during lap 90 of his race because he believed that voices in his head were telling him to do so. The next year, during the Winston 500, drivers arrived to their vehicles only to find that their brake lines had been damaged and that sand had been put in their gasoline tanks. In the years since, a handful of incidents have occurred that inevitably get linked back to the original curse.

But where does this jinx come from? Some believe that a Native American shaman placed a curse on the land many years ago when his tribe was forced off of it by former President and U.S. Army general Andrew Jackson. Others believe that the track was built on a Native American burial ground. Whatever the case, it's easy to believe that something isn't right over in Talladega.

7. The Based God's Curse
Origin: Lil B's retaliation after Kevin Durant dissed him on Twitter
Teams/people involved: Kevin Durant
Year started: 2011

In the year that Kevin Durant managed to win his first MVP, you'd think that any talk about curses would be the last thing on the mind of any Durant observer, right? Unfortunately, so long as the Based God's curse continues to hang over Durant's head, it's all anyone will talk about when discuss the MVP's lack of championships. It all started in 2011 when Durant took to Twitter to diss Lil B's music. Displeased, the Based God placed a curse on Durant, effectively forbidding Oklahoma City from ever capturing a title while Durant was on their team.

In 2012, Lil B flip-flopped on the curse, lifting it from Durant's head and allowing prosperity to reign in OKC. However, during the 2014 All Star Game, the good times appeared to be over when the Based God tweeted, ""AND FUCK KEVIN DURANT LIL B FOR LIFE - Lil B."" And we even asked a fortune teller whether or not the curse was official.

With Serge Ibaka now sidelined for the playoffs and Oklahoma City's title chances dimming, it appears that the Based God Curse is indeed back. Better luck next year, KD.

6. The Sports Illustrated Cover Curse
Origin: Eddie Mathews, the first athlete on the cover of Sports Illustrated, breaks his hand
Teams/people involved: Various athletes depicted on the cover of Sports Illustrated
Year started: 1954

Even from the very first cover, Sports Illustrated has been known for having some strange incidents occur in relation to their cover athletes. For the first issue, it was former Braves star Eddie Mathews, who would end up suffering a broken hand shortly after he was placed on the cover. After that, Jill Kinmont's paralysis in 1955—which occurred during the same week that she was on the cover of SI—added to the list of tragic and untimely accidents.

Since these two initial incidents, a storied history of trouble or bad luck has emerged in connection with Sports Illustrated, giving way to the belief that a jinx is associated with the magazine. Though no specific origin has been named as the reason for the curse, the common consequences that these athletes have suffered suggests a common cause to some.

5. The Madden Curse
Origin: The Madden video game franchise
Teams/people involved: Select Madden cover athletes
Year started: 1999

The Madden curse has a well-established list of evidence to make even the biggest skeptic consider the possibility that being a video game cover athlete carries bad mojo. From former San Francisco 49er Garrison Hearst in 1999 to former Philadelphia franchise player Donovan McNabb in 2006 to Peyton Hillis in 2011, numerous football players have suffered uncharacteristically bad years, tough injuries, or sour luck during the season in which they were the face of the Madden franchise.

However, two significant outliers have appeared in the past couple seasons with Calvin Johnson and Adrian Peterson, both of whom managed to have solid or—in the case of Johnson—record-setting years in the NFL. Will Madden 15 continue this turnaround?

4. The Curse of the Honey Bears
Origin: The disbandment of the Chicago Bears cheerleading squad
Teams/people involved: Chicago Bears
Year started: 1985

After the original Bears owner George Halas died in 1983, his daughter, Virginia Halas McCaskey, took over the franchise with a few changes in mind. First and foremost, Mrs. McCaskey wanted to eliminate the team cheerleaders because of the sexism inherent to their position. It made sense, and the cheerleaders known as the Honey Bears were taken away when their contract in ended in 1985.

But, as you'll recall, 1985 was a good year for Chicago. The Bears dominated the league that season before winning Super Bowl XX in a commanding fashion over the New England Patriots. However, since the Honey Bears have left, Chicago hasn't managed to do anything memorable. And though there have been efforts to resurrect the team cheerleaders, management has repeatedly refused to bend on Mrs. McCaskey's wishes.

The Bears did manage to appear in the 2006 Super Bowl against the Indianapolis Colts, but they were thoroughly embarrassed by Peyton Manning & Co., falling 29-17 in a game that wasn't even as close as the score might suggest.

3. The Curse of Chief Wahoo
Origin: The Cleveland Indians changed their logo to a caricature of a Native American
Teams/people involved: Cleveland sports teams
Year started: 1947

Cleveland sports have been so bad that a curse seems to be the only logical explanation for their ineptitude. So, while one might think that the Curse of Chief Wahoo would only apply to the Cleveland Indians, the rest of the Cleveland sports franchises appear to have been roped in by association. Since 1951—when the Indians redesigned their already controversial logo to its even worse current form—the team has failed to win a World Series. Their last championship came in 1948, though they appeared in the World Series in both 1995 and 1997.

However, since that time, the curse has seemingly managed to spread to Cleveland's other teams, the Browns and the Cavaliers. The Cavs have never won an NBA title, and famously lost LeBron James to ""The Decision"" in 2010. Meanwhile, the Browns lost their entire franchise when former team owner Art Modell uprooted the team in 1995 and took them to Baltimore. Of course, the Browns haven't won a title since 1964, in either their old incarnation or their current franchise.

The fact that the Ravens have already managed to capture two just adds insult to injury.

2. The Curse of Bobby Layne
Origin: Bobby Layne is traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers
Teams/people involved: Detroit Lions
Year started: 1958

Few franchises in professional sports have been as bad over the past five decades as the Detroit Lions. And why exactly is that? Well, depending on who you believe, former franchise quarterback Bobby Layne is to blame. According to legend, after Layne was dealt to the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1958, he proclaimed that the Lions would not win for 50 years.

Though his quote has since been disputed, it remains a fact that the Lions have failed to produce any results in the time since. Even when superstar running back Barry Sanders came to town, the Lions still failed to do much of anything. Indeed, since Layne's absence, Detroit has been 1-10 in 10 playoff appearances, and in 2008—the final year of the supposed curse—they became the first franchise to ever go 0-16 in a season. They also remain one of just four franchises in the NFL to have never gone to a Super Bowl.

1. The Curse of the Billy Goat
Origin: Billy Sianis and his billy goat were forced to leave Wrigley Stadium during the 1945 World Series
Teams/people involved: Chicago Cubs
Year started: 1945

What accounts for the Chicago Cubs' 100-plus years of ineptitude? Why is it that the Cubbies have failed to win a title since 1908? Is it their general lack of talent year in and year out? Is it Steve Bartman or any other infamous figure in the team's lore? Or is it Billy Sianis, who supposedly cursed the franchise after he was forced out of a Cubs game during the 1945 World Series? As the story goes, Sianis—who was the owner of the nearby Billy Goat Tavern—had brought his own goat to the game, only for security to ask him that he leave the stadium due to the animal's overpowering stench. Incensed, Sianis apparently said, ""Them Cubs, they ain't gonna win no more,"" a declaration which has proved correct to this day.

In the 1945 World Series, the Cubs would end up losing to the Detroit Tigers and have yet to even win a National League pennant in the time since. Though various measures have been made by the team and the fans in attempts to reverse this curse—including a severed goat's head that was sent to team owner Tom Ricketts last year—nothing has proved successful, and the Cubs stay losing.",Complex,2008,"[92, 64, 62]",3

Let's get down to it
Nervous hands and anxious smiles
I can feel you breathing
This is right where we belong
Turn up the music

Oh oh oh oh

This is the dance for all the lovers
Takin' a chance for one another
Finally it's our time now
These are the times that we'll remember
Breaking the city's heart together
Finally it's our time now
It's our time now

This is more than just romance
It's an endless summer
I can feel the butterflies, leading me through it
Take my heart, I'll take your hand
As we're falling under
This is an addiction girl
Let's give in to it

Oh oh oh oh

This is the dance for all the lovers
Takin' a chance for one another
Finally it's our time now
These are the times that we'll remember
Breaking the city's heart together
Finally it's our time now

Get up
Come on brothers

Beyond the boundaries of your city's lights
Stand the heroes waiting for your cries

Your brothers and sisters to care
I'll be right here

Holding the light for the ones that we guide
From the dark of despair
Standing on guard for the ones that we sheltered
We'll always be ready
Because we will always be there

When there are people crying in the streets
When they're starving for a meal to eat
When they simply need a place to make their beds
Right here underneath my wing
You can rest your head

Your brothers and sisters to care
I'll be right here

Hope and pray that you'll never need me
But rest assured I will not let you down
I'll walk beside you but you may not see me
The strongest among you may not wear a crown

On that day when you need
Your brothers and sisters to care
I'll be right here

[Hook 2]
On that day when you don't have the strength
For the burden you bear
I'll be right here

What you got if you ain't got love?
The kind that you just wanna give away
It's okay to open up
Go ahead and let the light shine through
I know it's hard on a rainy day
You wanna shut the world out and just be left alone
But don't run out on your faith

'Cause sometimes that mountain you've been climbing is just a grain of sand
And what you've been up there searching for forever is in your hands
When you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else seem so small

It's so easy to get lost inside
A problem that seems so big at the time
It's like a river that's so wide
It swallows you whole
While you're sitting 'round thinking 'bout what you can't change
And worrying about all the wrong things
Time's flying by
Moving so fast
You better make it count 'cause you can't get it back

92. Rahzel did the “Jesus Walks” beat thinking Kanye actually produced the shit, meaning Kanye made Rahzel beatbox some ghost produced song

94. West is my least favorite direction
95. Newborns named Kanye are up 600%

124. In the words of Jonathan Scobell: “Kanye is a disgrace to the Chi”
125. Him and Dame Dash are friends

128. Jeff Head isn’t good enough to be on the motherfuckin petition. And I hate Kanye West because of that? Sure
129. Has a mixtape called “Jeanius Level Musik.”
130. Again, not kidding
131. He says “[he gave] CL love.”
132. I don’t want to know what that means
133. Freewest = Freeway + Kanye West collabos
134. Whoever came up with that should stab himself
135. Repeatedly
136. In the eye
137. And I’m 89% sure it was Kanyeeze
138. Kanyeeze is definitely not a word
139. He has AIDS
140. He “supports our troops.”
141. Whatever the fuck that means
142. Bol is going to battle Mr. West, appearently
143. Did I just hear Kanye say “bitches love me”?
144. Then again, he might be talking about himself
145. Or his mom
146. One of the main producers for the Dipshits
147. I bet he voted for George W
148. Cause of, you know, the “ridonkulous religious beliefs.”
149. People seriously think Common is like a disciple of Kanye
150. And by “people” I mean Kanye West
151. And his punk groupies, of course
152. I considered writing a one-act play just to show how much I hate him
153. He deserves an award in bullshit
154. Or else you’re undermining your whole award show, dammit!
155. In the words of an emo girl:
“[me:] cuz he didn’t write his songs”
“[emo girl:] really? thats so fucked up”
156. See? Mr. West can't even get emo girls to bang!
157. And dammit! I (not being a rich-ass soft emo-like bitch) could do it!
158. He is what is standing between me and a copy of 1st Infantry
159. His favorite food is pizza, which is incredibly lame cause he’s rich as hell
160. Okay, he definitely voted for Dubya
161. I mean rich, lazy, egotistical, religious = republican
162. Always
163. WTF is up w/Kon the Louis Vuitton Don?
164. Cmon, he has a mixtape called “I’m Good.”
165. Cut the egotistical bullshit, Kanye
166. There’s no Kanye products in the Spitkicker store that I can make fun of
167. He called himself “wack”
168. 12 times
169. In the same interview
170. He might just outdo me in a description of how wack he is
171. He took time away from Heartscab
172. And Heartscab is WAY iller than Kanye
173. I mean, Eazy-E is on that shit
174. He got out-rhymed by Snoop Dogg in 2004
175. And by un-underground Busta Rhymes in the same song in the same year
176. Oh, and I remember, Snoop Dogg was freestyling on the Get By Beat and he still out-rhymed Kanye
177. And even Mr. Cheeks, who was freestyling w/Snoop was better
178. Actually I never heard Mr. Cheeks’ verse, but I’m sure it was better
179. Damn, now people won't trust me
180. Rhymefest, w/a better flow, didn’t get any airplay w/Jesus Walks
181. Yet, on the same station, Kanye gets regular play
182. He’s anti-Semitic
183. Kanye? Go make a group w/1980’s Professor Griff, for Jesus’ sake
184. He went to college
185. And dropped out
186. And he’s encouraging others to be brain-dead like that
187. His “freestyles” are written
188. One of his mixtapes has an “original version of Jesus Walks.”
189. And it has no Rhymefest
190. He’s got like 8000 mixtapes out
191. That makes him TOO much like G-Unit/Dipshits
192. He thinks he’s Run-DMC or something
193. He might just make a Christmas song like them
194. I can’t think of any more reasons right now; I’m just listening to Run-DMC - It’s Tricky
195. In the words of Joseph Simmons:  “They even bother my poor father cause he’s down with me.”
196. His mother searches for her son’s name on the internet
197. Now, Bol’s site would be like the 8 millionth site for the search term “Kanye West.”
198. Which means she had to go through 8 million pages to get to say shit about Bol
199. Which is sad
200. Damn, I just felt a little compassion there
201. New Work Out Plan (remix) Production by Lil John = me dying
202. How the fuck does Mr. West not even produce that shit?
203. He just raps, produced by Lil’ Jon
204. That shit I said earlier about maybe they do an album together? It’s all happening
205. Sore loser
206. He has 1 album out, and he already has a “Lost Tapes” mixtape
207. How the fuck does this bitch lose tapes in less than 6 months?
208. Why would anybody put it out regardless?
209. He’s in a goddamn cell phone commercial
210. I hate the idea of him making songs with Game using cell phones to rap
211. He’s opened the door for some more bullshit commercials, i.e. the Snoop cell phone commercials
212. He jacked the hook from the IOF for Ludacris
213. He re-sold beats from Cap.One to Jay-Z
214. That makes him as immoral as the Alchemist
215. And Alchemist “is the dirtiest cracka in the whole music biz,” according to Bol
216. The New York Daily News reports that Kanye charged a Maryland church $30,000 to perform the single there Friday
217. But he showed up three hours late and without a DJ, backup singers or dancers
218. The backpackers at okayplayer like him despite reasons #1-217
219. He fucking “fears” to lose cause he’s nominated against Usher. What a bitch!
220. That Irish kid in the NY Times likes him. He also likes “Redneck Woman”
221. Hey, Mr. West? Plagiarize this, bitch!

493,Falling In Love At A Coffee Shop,"I think that possibly, maybe I'm falling for you
Yes there's a chance that I've fallen quite hard over you
I've seen the paths that your eyes wander down
I want to come too

I think that possibly, maybe I'm falling for you

No one understands me quite like you do
Through all of the shadowy corners of me

[Hook]
I never knew just what it was about this old coffee shop
I love so much
All of the while I never knew
I never knew just what it was about this old coffee shop
I love so much
All of the while I never knew

I think that possibly, maybe I'm falling for you
Yes there's a chance that I've fallen quite hard over you
I've seen the waters that make your eyes shine
Now I'm shining too

Because oh because
I've fallen quite hard over you

If I didn't know you, I'd rather not know
If I couldn't have you, I'd rather be alone

I never knew just what it was about this old coffee shop

494,Fly Like Me,"[Hook: Amerie]
Now you done been around the world
And you'd seen a lot of girls
But you ain't never seen a girl look so fly like
Now you done rolled through some hoods
There's some girls that look good
But you ain't never seen a girl look so fly like
And you partied, and have hugs
And some girls show you love
But, you ain't never seen a girl look so fly like me
Baby, but you never had a girl look so fly like me

[Verse 1: Chingy]
Now I'd done been around the world, thought I'd seen it all
Err' color, err' shape, what I need and all
Switch like seasons, when the summers, spring and fall
And back seat of my jeep, I'm chrome veet and all
On the hunt for these girls were like my day to day
I get 'em alone, I jump 'em and then fade away
I give it good so some of them won't stay away
They try to lock me up, but I break away
And to the day i lay my eyes on the princess
And you can tell she was a dime from a distance
It took a minute to come to my senses
She's the perfect match and God is my witness
Now for the first time I've opened my eyes
Put the glass in the air, now I toast to the sky
Feels like I'm in heaven, and I'm hoping to fly
Baby girl, come along for the ride, you know why cause I...

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chingy]
Now I ain't never had a girl that was so fly
Other guys come around, you acting so shy
You got 'em shaking in their boots, and I know why
Cause they can't handle the truth and that's no lie
As for me, I'm the one that you been dreaming on
And when you saw me, I'm the one that you were steaming on
And when you need it, I'm the shoulder that you would be leaning on
Take off that Gucci and keep them Vicky sneakers on
Let's take a flight 'cause the world is our playground
And buy houses from the Lou, to the A-Town
It's silk sheets so it's soft when you lay down
Ching-a-ling, yeah, I get down and stay down
There's no one better, baby girl, you's a blessing
You got me heading in a positive direction
You got my vote, when you re-up for election
Cause all I wanna do is give you love and affection

[Hook]

[Bridge: Amerie/Chingy]
Why you wasting your time (say what?)
And boy, running the streets (say what?)
When you can just come to me? (oh, is that right?)
You know i got what you need (say what?)
I got what you want (say what?)
Boy, won't you come and see? (all there, babe!)
What if you never seen a girl like me ever, like me before?
Won't you come inside, let me keep it dry
Cause I'm so fly

495,Livin' Our Love Song,"Baby when I look at you with your hair fallin' down and your baby blues
Standing there across the room I get so lost in the way you move
It makes me reminisce back to years ago on a night like this
Teary eyed as you took my hand and I told you that I'd be your man
So many things have come so many things have gone
One thing that's stayed the same is our love is still growing strong

{Chorus}
Baby just look at us all this time and we're still in love
Something like this just don't exist
Between a backwoods boy and a fairy tale princess
People said it would never work out
Living our dreams has shattered all doubts
It feels good to prove 'em wrong
Living our love song

Oh darling would you look at me
With my heart beating fast and my shaking knees
It's pretty hard to believe after all these years I still need you this badly
You're dancing in my arms with a spotlight moon in a sea of stars
Girl we've come so far everything I want is everything that you are
I just want to lay you down
Say I love you without a sound
I think you know what I'm talking about

{Chorus}

{Chorus}

Feels good to prove 'em wrong
Just living our love song",Jason Michael Carroll,2008,[98],1
496,Until The End Of Time,"[Produced By: Johnny J & Trackmasters]

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Perhaps I was addicted to the dark side
Somewhere inside my childhood witnessed my heart die
And even though we both came from the same places
The money and the fame made us all change places
How could it be? Through the misery that came to pass
The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask
For currency, but you could run to me when you need
And I'll never leave, honestly
Someone to believe in, as you can see
It's a small thing to a true, what could I do?
Real homies help you get through
And come to knew he'd do the same thing if he could
‘Cause in the hood, true homies make you feel good
And half the times we be actin' up, call the cops
Bringin' a cease to the peace that was on my block
It never stops, when my mama ask me will I change
I tell her yeah, but it's clear I'll always be the same
Until the end of time

[Hook: R.L. Huggar]
So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time, until the end of time

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Please, Lord, forgive me for my life of sin
My hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids
So you know, I don't hang around the house much
This all-night money makin' got me outta touch
Shit, ain't flashed a smile in a long while
An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs
My attitude got me walkin' solo
Ride out alone in my lo-lo
Watchin' the whole world move in slow-mo
For quiet times, disappear, listen to the ocean
Smokin' Ports, think my thoughts, then it's back to coastin'
Who can I trust in this cold world?
My phony homie had a baby by my old girl
But I ain't trippin', I'm a player, I ain't sweatin' him
I sexed his sister, had her mumble like a Mexican
His next of kin, no remorse, it was meant to happen
Besides rappin', the only thing I did good was scrappin'
Until the end of time

[Hook: R.L. Huggar]
So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time, until the end of time

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Now who's to say if I was right or wrong
To live my life as an outlaw all along?
Remain strong in this planet full of player haters
They conversate, but Death Row full of demonstrators
And in the end, drinkin' Hennessy
Made all my enemies envy me
So cold when I flow, eliminatin' easily
Falls to they knees, they plead for they right to breathe
While beggin' me to keep the peace (haha)
When I conceive closer to achieve
In times of danger, don't freeze, time to be a G
Follow my lead, I'll supply everything you need
An ounce of game and the training to make a G
Remember me as an outcast Outlaw
Another album out, that's what I'm about: more
Gettin' raw 'til the day I see my casket
Buried as a G while the whole world remembers me
Until the end of time

[Hook: R.L. Huggar]
So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time, until the end of time",2Pac,2008,[43],1

Send in your skeletons
Sing as their bones go marching in again

Done pleading ignorance, that whole defense

[Verso 1]
Cada blanco en mi mente
Se vuelve color con verte
Y el deseo de tenerte
Es más fuerte, es más fuerte
Solo quiero que me lleves
De tu mano por la senda
Y atravesar el bosque que divide nuestras vidas
Hay tantas cosas que me gustan hoy de ti

[Coro]
Me enamora, que me hables con tu boca
Me enamora, que me eleves hasta el cielo
Me enamora, que de mí sea tu alma soñadora
La esperanza de mis ojos
Sin ti mi vida no tiene sentido
Sin ti mi vida es como un remolino
De cenizas que se van, oh
Volando con el viento

[Verso 2]
Yo no sé si te merezco
Solo sé que aún deseo
Que le des luz a mi vida
En los días venideros
Léeme muy bien los labios
Te lo digo bien despacio
Por el resto de mis días quiero ser tu compañía
Hay tantas cosas que me gustan hoy de ti

[Coro]
Me enamora, que me hables con tu boca
Me enamora, que me eleves hasta el cielo
Me enamora, que de mí sea tu alma soñadora

De cenizas que se van, oh
Me enamora, que me hables con tu boca
Me enamora, que me eleves hasta el cielo
Me enamora, que de mí sea tu alma soñadora

503,Nothin' Better To Do,"[Verse 1]
Hung my cotton dress on rusted wire
Up there on Pilahatchee Bridge
Just a crazy roughneck's daughter
Jumped head-first into the water
Baptized away my sins
Hitched to town with Bobby Jo and Tommy
Couple of lookers, new best friends
We slipped in the back of Sunday service
Know them church ladies, they heard us
Bum smoke money from the offering

[Chorus]
Mama said, ""Idle hands are Devil's handiwork
Oh, the trouble you'll get into
You got nothin' better to do, got nothin' better to do
You got nothin' better to do, got nothin' better to do""
Yeah!

[Verse 2]
Sign read 'Bait, Chips, Beer and Ammunition'
That Slim-Jim bag boy hadn't a prayer
Well, I hiked my skirt and did the talkin'
While them boys were busy walkin'
Case of .5 out the back door
Hid deep in the Mississippi backwoods
We danced and played around 'til dark
Well, I had them wrestlin' for my first kiss
Turned into a fight and they missed
Me speedin' off in Tommy's car

[Chorus]
Mama said, ""Idle hands are Devil's handiwork
Oh, the trouble you'll get into
You got nothin' better to do, got nothin' better to do
You got nothin' better to do, got nothin' better to do""
Yeah!

Nobody hurt, nobody harmed
Nobody's business but my own

Oh, the trouble you'll get into""

You got nothin' better to do, got nothin' better to do
You got nothin' better to do, got nothin' better to do

You got nothin' better to do, babe, got nothin' better to do
You got nothin' better to do, babe, you got nothin' better to do, no no
