0,On Bended Knee,"[Verse 1]
Darlin' I, I can't explain
Where did we lose our way
Girl it's drivin' me insane
And I know I just need one more chance
To prove my love to you
And if you come back to me
I'll guarantee
That I'll never let you go

[Chorus]
Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they use to be?
Oh God give me a reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

[Verse 2]
So many nights I dream of you
Holding my pillow tight
And I know I don't need to be alone
When I open up my eyes
To face reality
Every moment without you
It seems like eternity
I'm begging you, begging you come back to me

[Chorus]
Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they use to be?
Oh God give me a reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

[Spoken]
Baby, I'm sorry
Please forgive me for all the wrong I've done
Please come back home, girl
I know you put all your trust in me
I'm sorry I let you down
Please forgive me

[Bridge]
I'm Gonna swallow my pride
Say I'm sorry
Stop pointing fingers the blame is on me
I want a new life
And I want it with you
If you feel the same
Don't ever let it go
You gotta believe in the spirit of love
It'll heal all things
It won't hurt anymore
No I don't believe our love's terminal
I'm down on my knees begging you please
Come home

[Chorus]
Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be?
Oh God give me a reason
I'm down on bended...
Down on bended knee
I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee
Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they use to be
Oh God give me a reason
I'm down on
Down on bended knee
I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

1,Another Night,"[Intro]
Lately I just been workin', writin'
Haven't really got outta the crib too much

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
As I spend another night without a single thing to do
'Cept writin' down this music I proceed to bring to you
My man Billy hit me up, he got some weed he bringin' through
Tell him better be that good and grab a pack of Swishers too
That's what usually happens, deserve some cool relaxin'
Smokin' herb and laughin' at Curb Your Enthusiasm
I'm just a regular kid, at my crib
Doin' regular shit, burnin' 5 spliffs
I'm so high, another night alone
So I'm a pour another cup and roll another zone
I'm gone, you ain't gonna bring me back
So gone, couldn't tell you where I'm at
Maybe New York, Philly, maybe Pittsburgh
You wanna find me, hit me on Twitter
Wow, that sound mad lame
People love me, they don't even know my last name
Waitin' at the station till it's time that I can board the train
Headin' to the fortune fame, should explore my brain
See what I'm thinkin bout
Pour a little liquor then I drink it down

[Hook]
'Cause it's just another night on my own
Layin' back as I light up my Dro
It's just another night alone
I spend another night alone
Said it's just another night on my own
Layin' back as I light up my Dro
It's just another night alone
I spend another night alone

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I turn my phone on silent, I need to get away
Put on J. Cole's Warm Up and let it play
I thank god for blessin' me with life every day
And to my peoples who've gone, we'll meet at Heaven's gate
I've been sellin' haze, but I'm sure there's better ways
That I can get my pay, I just need to get it straight
Nothin' left to say now it's time for action
No more bullshit, no more relaxin'
Rappin's my passion, so I stay writin'
Spend a couple nights and
Burn out all the lights in
My room, stuck in my crib like glue
That's what I do it's nothin' new

[Hook]
'Cause it's just another night on my own
Layin' back as I light up my Dro
It's just another night alone
I spend another night alone
Said it's just another night on my own
Layin' back as I light up my Dro
It's just another night alone

But I'm a creep

What the hell am I doing here?

I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special

[Chorus]
But I'm a creep

3,Always,"[Verse 1]
That Arizona sky
Burnin' in your eyes
You look at me and babe, I wanna catch on fire
It’s buried in my soul
Like California gold
You found the light in me that I couldn’t find

So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play

4,I Wanna Be Down,"[Verse 1]
I would like to get to know if I could be
The kind of girl you that you could be down for
Cuz when I look at you I feel something tell me
That you're the kind of guy that I should make a move on
And if I don't let you know
Then I won't be for real
I could be wrong but I feel like something could be going on
The more I see you the more that it becomes so true
There ain't no other for me it's only you

[Chorus]
I wanna be down
With what you're going through
I wanna be down
I wanna be down with you
No matter what time of day or night it's true
I wanna be down

[Verse 2]
I know anybody's gonna be lonely
Without the reason they got someone to care for
Maybe all you need's a shoulder to cry on
If that's a fact than I'll be more than you ever could dream of
If all you need is the time that I got plenty of
I'll dedicate all my love until you call baby
I wanna stay by your side
Be there to call you up
And let you know everything will be all right

[Chorus]
I wanna be down
With what you're going through
I wanna be down
I wanna be down with you
No matter what time of day or night it's true

I want to say I love you

8,I'm The Only One,"[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man it's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given, much is tested
Get arrested guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do, act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry, more Louis V
My Momma couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel man
I ain't one of the Cosby's, I ain't go to Hillman
I guess the money should've changed him
I guess I should've forgot where I came from

You say I'm crazy
Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Let up the suicide doors
This is my life homie, you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldn't tell ya who decide wars
So I parallel double parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking bout back in my day
But homie this is my day, class started 2 hours ago
Oh am I late? No, I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh they so sensitive
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon' end up apologing
Let me know if it's a problem then, aight man, holla then

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Let the champagne splash
Let that man get cash
Let that man get past
He don't even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors
He can drive off of fumes cause
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure, what's your pleasure?
Life is a, Uh, depending how you dress her
So if the devil wear Prada, Adam Eve wear nada
I'm in between but way more fresher
With way less effort, cause when you try hard
That's when you die hard
Your homies looking like why God
When they reminisce over you, my God

Of love so true, that once turned all my gray skies blue

Soft with love are my thoughts of you
Now that you're gone, oh, I don't know what to do

If only you were here, you'd wash away my tears
The sun would shine, and once again you'd be mine, all mine

Oh, and the award for the best liar goes to you (Goes to you)
For making me believe
That you could be faithful to me
Let's hear your speech, oh
How 'bout a round of applause?
A standing ovation

But you put on quite a show (Uh-oh)
Really had me going

You gotta be cool, you gotta be calm, you gotta stay together
All I know, all I know, love will save the day

Herald what your mother said
Read the books your father read
Try to solve the puzzles in your own sweet time
Some may have more cash than you
Others take a different view

15,All I Wanna Do,"[Intro]
Hit it!
This ain't no disco
It ain't no country club either
This is LA!

[Verse 1]
""All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die,""
Says the man next to me out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing
He says his name is William, but I'm sure
He's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy
And he's plain ugly to me, and I wonder if
He's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash
The good people of the world are washing their cars
On their lunch break, hosing and scrubbing
As best they can in skirts in suits
They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me, cause

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

[Verse 2]
I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar
Then he lights every match in an oversized pack
Letting each one burn down to his thick fingers
Before blowing and cursing them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud
As they spin on the floor
And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads, but

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

[Bridge]
Otherwise the bar is ours
The day and the night and the car wash too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty
Cars
The sun and the moon but

[Chorus Variation]
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling the party's just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun
I won't tell you that you're the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun

Yo Yo
Check check yo
Every man acknowledge my polished
Metaphoric graphic logic and knowledge
It's like my brain is on anabolics
My sound is raw
I'm more Fostex than Panasonic
Man I'm on this
Every mic i smoke it like a bag of chronic
Panoramic pictureful trails
I'm known to prophesise
My potent poetic rhymes are perfection personified
Producing paranormal activity lyrically
My levitating literacy has you meditating literally

[Leaf Dog]
Beat specialist
8 bar attack plan
Rely on this like your second time at a fat scam
Attack mic stands like cantona fans
Never squealin' on the hook like abattoir lambs
Everything I make bangs like a nuclear scientist
Loop ?? burn samples the arsonist
Bump this vibration on the ground is elevation
If your looking up to fly in space
There's no limitation

[Smellington Piff]
I'm here to open your brain like a lobotomist
I'll jump out of a plane to stay on top of this
Around here we live by the wicker man theory, eerie
Pick a thick fickle brain apart, let it pickle in the jar
Lock stock traffic cop, knocked out for tryna stick tickets on your caravan
I'm that scallywag vagabond traveller man
That reads tea leaves and casts spells like Saruman

[Si Philli]
The hard barrer
Spirit of Che Guavara
Rap bandits see me riding the track on a Kuwahara
This is karma
This dark guy lightin' for dark sky
Spittin I'm bringin' sight to rappers like im arc eye

Lines finer than white china
Illin' my spits, still comin' sharper than lime cider
These real words we stay puffin' them ill herbs
Flippin' the biggest scriptures

Sewin' seeds like a dog with 2 dicks
Now they're seein movements like some cockroaches moved in

Ay yo i could do with two bun of the buddha skunk
Kat im chewin up so just losing the funk
Hoodie up and im screwing your mum
A ruthless cunt
True Anglo-Saxon words used from my tongue
Abusing my lungs
Drinking juice and rum
So choose your way to depart this earth
I'm getting scared when my heart hurts
Hackin' barclays passwords
I got a parched thirst

[Jehst]
On beat and off key
So many white boys on the track steal the milkybars are on me
Mr Dairylea
Smoke cheese till my eyes turn so chinese
I can barely see
Turn the beat in to UFC blood sport

Money for the slum lord
We puff draw in large amounts, much more
Totally stonefaced
Mount Rushmore

[Jack Jetson]
High writing this shit
The sky scientist
Jack climbin up the weedstalk to where the giant lives
Kaleidoscope, tight-ropin' psychedelic cyclist
Eyes closed mind open isometric spiralin'
Sad rappers play the hypothetic violin
Ain't got time to grin thats why humors stay as dry as gin
Super human with the mutant thing that lies within
Creepin' through the sewers like reptilians with slimy skin

[Dirty Dike]
Pit bike, prick on the back
Half ounce of chop
Shoutin' bollocks like I absolutely can't be stopped
Take a Stanley to your string Gabanna rani top
And stick a green banana up your rinky dinky party slot
Pick a seat and you can get a free dick
And sit and keep dog like my Pekinese bitch
Mecca mecca means shit
I kick a rapper in a piss cloud
Make the shit evaporate away
Shit now

I punch drunk throwin jabs at a blurry shape
Learnt my fate in the mud by the pearly gates
I set the bar high, fools aren't reachin' it
Yo look feeble kid, bro, do you even lift? (spot me bruv)

Send them all back to the bench looking unwell
You're having issue with development

Slicin' coconuts
Toppin' up his isotopes
Mys is known to magnify your focus more than rifle scopes
Walking with the dead
Soon sure to hit the ledge
Not a task at all to answer all

It's OJ before he stashed that glove
Helpin you reach your final destination
Quicker than your satnav does

Who has mad stance and packs that punch
Let him know its never ending like a fat mans lunch

Fuck a tweet chatter your beak
And leeks pasa?
Bet you if we catch you you’ll leak your weak bladder
Put ya strand on ya, ya piece and tell you no speak nadda

For rizzle for shankle for shizzle my nizzle my nine

Couldn't sum this up like a monkey with an abacus
Mad absinthe's eradicating any abstinence
So far gone I need some psychoanalysis

It's like magic with a puff of the smoke how he vanishes
Yet still pulls rabbits out the hat like Paul Daniels

Smell the vodka
Do your for your bread and butter
Slap ya out your Ralph Lauren teddy jumper

It's Eric The Red
The uncontrollable, unmouldable
Unapproachable, know-it-all
Your shit sounds watered down like its soluble
Keep it low key like a crime thats unsolvable

Fuck wearin' a bally
Chillin' in death valley
Await the finale like a heavyweight title
Without Bear Grylls livin' a life of survival

The real pow wow not the fake vibrational
Your row now quakes the foundational
Listen to the don with the necronomicon in his palm
And the fire that he vomits upon
Hitch a ride then the comet is gone
Til the next star system
With orion girls droppin her thong
All hail the mad titan
The scavenger of flesh
Tryna court the affections of the avatar of death

Chasin' rappers like the owe me somethin'

This one on some whole new function

Oh, won't you hold my hand?
Cause I don't wanna walk on my own anymore
Won't you understand? Cause I don't wanna walk alone
I'm ready for this, there's no denying
I'm ready for this, you stop me falling
I'm ready for this, I need you all in
I'm ready for this, so darling, hold my hand

[Verse 2]
Soul is like a melting pot when you're not next to me
Tell me that you've got me and you're never gonna leave
Tryna find a moment where I can find release
Please tell me that you've got me and you're never gonna leave

[Pre-Chorus]
Break my bones but you won't see me fall, oh
The rising tide will rise against them all, oh

[Chorus]
Darling, hold my hand
Oh, won't you hold my hand?
Cause I don't wanna walk on my own anymore
Won't you understand? Cause I don't wanna walk alone
I'm ready for this, there's no denying
I'm ready for this, you stop me falling
I'm ready for this, I need you all in
I'm ready for this, so darling, hold my hand

[Bridge]
Don't wanna know
That feeling when I'm all alone
So please don't make me wait, cause I don't wanna break
No, I don't wanna fall
When you're next to me
Can tell I'm not afraid to be
That you don't make me wait, and never let me break
You never let me fall

[Chorus]
Darling, hold my hand
Oh, won't you hold my hand?
Cause I don't wanna walk on my own anymore
Won't you understand? Cause I don't wanna walk alone
I'm ready for this, there's no denying
I'm ready for this, you stop me falling

Late December, back in '63
What a very special time for me
As I remember, what a night

Oh, what a night
You know, I didn’t even know her name
But I was never gonna be the same
What a lady, what a night

Oh I, got a funny feelin' when she walked in the room
Oh my, as I recall it ended much too soon

Oh, what a night
Hypnotizing, mesmerizing me
She was everything I dreamed she'd be
Sweet surrender, what a night

I felt a rush like a rollin’ ball of thunder
Spinnin' my head around n' takin' my body under
Oh, what a night

Oh I, got a funny feelin' when she walked in the room
Oh my, as I recall it ended much too soon

Oh, what a night
Why'd it take so long to see the light
Seemed so wrong, but now it seems so right
What a lady, what a night

Oh what a night, late December
Oh what a night, back in '63
Oh what a night, late December
Oh what a night, back in '63

You can do what you want, you can live in a dream
Get up, get in
Get the rhythm, get down

You're living your life in peace and in harmony
You making your own desisions
That's how it's got to be for you and me

So many people are running around and 'round
Without no sense of logic

I see lies in the eyes of a stranger, oho
You'll be living in danger
I see lies in the eyes of a stranger, oho
You'll be living in danger

I see lies in the eyes of a stranger, oho
You'll be living in danger

People are the same today as they used to be
The same expectations
So high no-one can reach that high
Nor I, nor you get satisfied today
We'll never get enough

I see lies in the eyes of a stranger, oho

I see lies in the eyes of a stranger, oho

How deep you were to penetrate my heart

It made me think this was meant to last
I never wanna be apart

It just keep getting better

[Intro]
JammaBeats

[Verse 1: Digga D]
Bro put a box in draws, 35s and scores
Phone man if you want that
Don't talk like you're bad, you ain't on that
Combat, juice gon' spill like Cognac
Whip that shit, don’t stop 'til I lock that
Heard there's a mash on sale, man cop that
Verbal abuse is long, akh, stop that
Back out the mash and drop that, shot that
If you want Buju, man got that
Ban and TT smash it and dot that, chop that
Countryside; where the gwops at
Jump in pics, you ain't bro, man, crop that
No whip, then pedal bike risk it, he flipped it
Back out my shank and dip it, ballistic
Push in my shank and twist it
Pebs in cling; that’s Oreo biscuits
Man's machine coming with lead
Misch and mash for the bread
This grey ting's way too fast
Bitch, pull up your drawers; I only want head
Man put dick down in her neck-neck
Bore tongue, that's the best
Ejaculate in her mouth, or pull out, ejaculate on her breast

[Verse 2: Sav'O]
In the field, I'm Air Force stepping
More time I just smashed out packs in the ends
Right now I'm tryna get this bread in
Get 'round there and ching man up
Like anything B get wetted
No face, no case and leathers
Four door whip with serious members
My bro wanna lurk on opps
So we go round there on a 125
Bro done whacked man's face with the longest blade
Tryna take man's eye
I heard that the opp boys ran with their shanks again
And I weren't surprised
Creepz Sav ain't on piss
He raps that shit and he ran ten times
Packs on me, Rambz on me
Push bike hitting them shoots
Peng gyal on man from the B
Feeling me and MSkum, too
My bros ain't down for the stunting
Digga D grab that dots and shoot
Us man ain't like them man
Them man lie and we tell the truth
Gang
Like, free all my bros, soon touch road
How many times have I rid on Bush?
Like one of them boy gotta go
Back out my ting and make man swim
Like ching man down on volts
Catch me a opp then stab up his head
Then ten toes back to the Grove
Then ten toes back to the Grove

[Verse 3: T.Y]
Friend of a opp is a opp
So I won't feel a way to go burn that bridge
My nigga Huncho gave him twenty-two chings
I can bet you that he's feeling pissed
Get 'round there Samurai's and flicks
JSav put his whole Rambz in your wig
My bro Digga D had the whole HR locked off
When he crossed that bridge
If I get my hands on a opp
I ain't wetting him once; I'm wetting him numerous times
See a opp right there
Tell bro don't jerk the car
Just keep it moving in line, ay
Four and a half, got bags of ball and dust
Man slap it in tens
If I back my splash, he don't back it up
No leg shots; man put it in chests
Like, bros got a thing for dargs
Teefing cats I ain't talking no pets
Bruck down a nine in flake
And whip it in Zs
Let it dry then put it in pebs
Cats dem call for the meds

[Verse 1: Digga D]
TT flake, twenty-three on a two-ie
Jakes just passed, hope they don't do a U-ie
OT, I don't like doing deals like Louie
Bad B like boujee, upsuh with two G's, like Gucci
Pour kettle water on it, watch it start bubbling
Straight drop, I ain't doubling
Use your chest, stop mumbling
Bro, I'm booky
I'll take your food if my belly starts rumbling
They rap about bootings, they ain't blammed nobody
Hold that properly when I bang that dotty
I put sniff in a 'rex, and I slang that Bobby
TT make it bling, always answering my hottie
Left my worker in the trap
While I flew to the town on pedal bike
Just to sweep some more cats
They ain't seeing no racks
I'm in and out of the trap
I left the door on the latch
When I add it up, take a oner off with the shorts
I'm a 0-1-1 but most of them are noughts
Fuck jail; fuck Jakes; fuck courts
Drilla got twelve cah he turned something corpse, crasses
What's all the hate for?
Is it 'cause I'm making dough?
That hate only push me to make more
I smash b, whip coke, smoke loud
Whip a Z, twenty six back, no doubt

[Verse 2: T.Y]
Feds know my face from the days when I sold buj'
Comfy in my ends and I got beef in my own hood
In the trap, left cracks on the floor like Hulk would
Gyalie said she like me 'cause I'm sweet and I'm so hood
Hospital, nose full of tubes
Got yourself shanked up cah your bros wanna screw
MSkum in the back, that's a problem for these yutes
Ten toes, what? Where? Don't get run out of your shoes
I get busy on my own, I get busy on the roads
Keep on braggin' 'bout them Z's, 'til I clean out your home
Gotta keep my face down cah Sini's kinda known
Cah my hood's like a jungle, no Indiana Jones
Me and F was in the trap, you was busy getting plaits
When your bro got touched, did you even chip in for a strap?
When I hopped off the ped, they did a one-hundred-metre track
If Huncho never stabbed it, then it's probably my nigga, Dappz
Took you twenty shank wounds, now you're only bringing waps?",CGM,1994,"[29, 39, 52, 52, 68, 73]",6
28,Never Lie,"[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I can see it in your eyes, they never lie
Hearin' rumors, fuck them, why I'm not surprised
I can tell you're dying deep inside
Showing love is something maybe you should try (Try)
Shouldn't be a hater all your life
Shouldn't be a hater all your life

I could see you niggas hating from afar (Far)
Try to hide it but I know just who you are (Are)
Nigga, we ain't got no ties (Nah)
I could see through your disguise ('sguise)
My chain real bright, my lil' bitch right
My niggas on sight, we never gon' hide
And niggas don't like and I know why (Why?)
When you see me you get mad, you wish that I was doing bad

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & Moneybagg Yo]
And I can see it in your eyes, they never lie
Hearing rumors, fuck them, why I'm not surprised
I can tell you're dying deep inside
Showing love is something maybe you should try (Try)
Shouldn't be a hater all your (Hey) life (Don't do that)
Shouldn't be a hater all your life (Ha)
Shouldn't be a hater all your life
(That's all you know how it do)

All your fuckin' life (Fuckin' life)
All your fuckin' life (Fuckin' life)
All your fuckin' life
Shouldn't be a hater all your life
All your fuckin' life (Hey)
All your fuckin' life (Nope)
All your fuckin' life
Shouldn't be a hater all your... (Nope)

[Verse 2: Moneybagg Yo]
Big Speaker here to tell you (What)
Better get your shit together (Why?)
You can't get no money (None)
Trying to live off hate forever (Facts)
I'm full of that midnight panic (No)
Floating light as a feather (No)
Walked in, iced out, made it rain, I changed the weather (Hey)
Soon as you pop, get a buzz
That's when they stop showing love (Crazy)
Done rapping for some validation
All the hate just tired of being wasted (Fugazi)
Diamonds on my chest not to flex on you
Wanna make it to the top, shit, nigga, me too
I'm a killer with the truth (Bagg)

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I can see it in your eyes, they never lie
Hearing rumors, fuck them, why I'm not surprised
I can tell you're dying deep inside
Showing love is something maybe you should try (Try)
Shouldn't be a hater all your life
Shouldn't be a hater all your life
Shouldn't be a hater all your life

All your fuckin' life (Fuckin' life)
All your fuckin' life (Fuckin' life)
All your fuckin' life

""What's the frequency, Kenneth?"" is your Benzedrine, uh-huh
I was brain-dead, locked out, numb, not up to speed
I thought I'd pegged you an idiot's dream
Tunnel vision from the outsider's screen

[Chorus]
I never understood the frequency, uh-huh
You wore our expectations like an armored suit, uh-huh

[Verse 2]
I'd studied your cartoons, radio, music, TV, movies, magazines
Richard said, ""Withdrawal in disgust is not the same as apathy""
A smile like the cartoon, tooth for a tooth
You said that irony was the shackles of youth

[Chorus]
You wore a shirt of violent green, uh-huh
I never understood the frequency, uh-huh

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
""What's the frequency, Kenneth?"" is your Benzedrine, uh-huh

You smile like the cartoon, tooth for a tooth
You said that irony was the shackles of youth

You wore a shirt of violent green, uh-huh
I never understood the frequency, uh-huh
You wore our expectations like an armored suit, uh-huh

You said that irony was the shackles of youth, uh-huh

Big stretch, not much sleep
I got a couple of palm trees on each side of my cheek
And it's a bright blue Saturday
In the rummage, sellin' the rubbish to me

[Pre-Chorus]
But if I could buy the sky
That's hangin' over this bed of mine
If I could climb these vines
And maybe see what you're seein'

[Chorus]
If you were standing on the corner
Staring straight in the eyes of Jesus Christ

[Verse 2]
One porch, one dog
And one cockroach, only one way to be
I got sewage fruit and it's growing out back from roots
But I don't know if they belong to me

[Pre-Chorus]
But if I could buy the sky
That's hangin' over this bed of mine
And if I could climb these vines
And maybe see what you're seein'

If you were sittin' on the edge of this building

Twenty stories below

[Outro]
And I can't tell you how many ways that I've sat
And viewed my life today, but I can tell you
I don't think that I can find easy way
So, if I see you walking hand-in hand-in hand
With a three armed man, you know I'll understand

You should have been in my shoes, yesterday",Blind Melon,1994,"[33, 30, 31, 32, 41, 39, 35, 37, 41, 46, 46, 58, 67, 94]",14

If I can't love myself enough to know
When it's time
Time to let go
Sing

[Chorus]
All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
All I really want
Is to be happy (I wanna be happy, yeah)
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet

[Verse 2]
I asked for a sign
From my sweet Lord above
I know the answer is in front of me, but when
You think you're in love
You only see what you wanna see
And all I see is me for you
And you for me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I cannot hide the way I feel inside
(No, I don't know why)
I don't know why but every day I wanna cry
(Every day I wanna cry)
But if I give you one more try
To these rules, will you abide?
And if I mean anything to you
Would it make everything all right?

All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet

All I really want (...if only we could be...)
Is to be happy (We can be happy)
And to find a love that's mine (I wanna be happy)
It would be so sweet

[Bridge]
I just wanna be so, so, happy
But the answer lies in me
I do believe
That we can be happy
I said I wanna be happy, yeah yeah yeah
Now let it breathe

Life is too short to be tryin' to play some games
Now take some time and think about
If it's really worth losing me
Why must it be this way?
Why do you have to play with my mind
All the time?
Help me sing it

All I really want is for me to be happy
(Ohhh, just help me sing it)
All I really want is for me to be happy
(Yeah, yeah yeah)
All I really want is for me to be happy
(Oh, you know I wanna be happy, yeah, yeah)
All I really want is for me to be happy

[Chorus]
All I really want
Is to be happy
(I don't wanna have to worry about nothin' no more)
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
All I really want
Is to be happy
(Said I wanna be, said I wanna be, said I wanna be)
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
(Said I wanna be happy if it's all right with you and me...)
All I really want (...it'll be all right with me)
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine

Is to be happy

Стреляю по Маглам
Ненавижу их стадо
Стреляю по Маглам
Они хотят услышать правду
Я ненавижу их стадо

[Куплет 1: Jessie Vatutin]
Плохой парень, как Драко Малфой
Ненавижу полукровок и Маглов
Их рэп это волшнебная шляпа
Она определяет их нахуй
В нашем жанре не мало
Этих ёбаных Маглов
Они хотят быть, как мы
И наваливать также
Я играю без правил
И мне плевать на время
Мой хип-хоп не умрет
Ведь я пожиратель смерти
Мы хотим тусоваться
Только с сильнейшими, знаешь
Мы должны быть командой
Против ебаных Маглов (Авада Кедавра)
Тусую на вписке -
Невменяемый белый парень
Я лучший в их списках
И мне всегда все рады
Раздутое эго
Раздутая печень
Бухло меня убьет
Но я пожиратель смерти

[Хук: Jessie Vatutin]
Стреляю по Маглам
Я стреляю по Маглам

Стреляю по Маглам
Они хотят слышать правду -
Я ненавижу их стадо

[Куплет 2: WILDNIGHTS]
Я ненавижу твой район
Ведь он слаще чем сахар
Слаще чем запах бывшей суки
Та, что на фото с кем-то успешней, чем ты
От вас недостаточный вайб
От вас не получим мы кайф
Ты это знай, волшебная палочка - майк
Я кладу к себе в карманы кучу таблов
Я схавал их и стал мигом похож на мага
Твоя сука хотела к нам, хоть мы без бабок
Конечно, кто хочет тусить с ебаным Маглом?
С ебаным Маглом, с ебаным Маглом
Ведём себя нагло, ведём себя нагло
Пули не надо, чтоб убить этих Маглов
Стреляю по Маглам, стреляю по Маглам

Стреляю по Маглам

[Nikki Diaz] Don't be jealous of me
[Fingazz]    Don't knock my hustle or my fame
[Nikki Diaz] Don't be jealous

(Verse 1)
[Down]    For all the same, everywhere that you go
'Bout eighty-five percent, go be hatin' on your throat
Hatin' on your hustle
Hatin' on your flow
Hatin' cause you move fast, and they move slow
But I ain't trippin', though
I stay hittin' dro
And you never catch me slackin', I'm a pimpin'
I'm a don
You just a peon
My game sold like a fresh can of Free-On
I got big cake
And they just want a slice
Give 'em just a little
And now they want your ice

I see you jockin' my whips
And the ice around my wrist

I can hear you talkin' shhh...
I hustle for the things I get
You broke, I know my wealth
Next time, you hatin' on me
Take a good look at yourself

[Verse 2: Down (Nikki Diaz)]
So what's the real problem?
What's the issue?
Crying about your own career
Here's a tissue
Actin' like a little kid
Cut the gappin'
Before I get my grown man, on to start clappin'
And you don't want that
End up in a wreck
Like a solo game of chess, put yourself in check
I'm a king
And you a pawn
You do your jealous thing, and I'll get my hustle on
Cause I ain't got no time for the games
And not a damn dime for the dames
Separate the real G's from the lames
It's A Low Down Dirty Shame (Jealous)
But I gotta do what I do
And you gon' do what you do
I got a million to gain, and you got nothin' to lose
And you can love it or hate it
You can sit and debate it
If you really hate the game or the way that you play it
You jealous

[Verse 1: Layzie Bone]
You're feelin' the strength of the rump, step up
Hear the funk of the jump that the thugstas feel
Just be thuggin', straight buzzin'
Lovin' your peoples cause we so real
Chill, better bring your weapon when steppin'
Bring on that ammunition, trip and don't slip
Not to mention, never knew no competition
But I gotta get mine
So scream out ""Mo'!"" and let me hear ya holla
Not about that mighty dollar
Roll with the Bone, Mo' Thugs will follow
Chain gang remaining the same
Flaming my dank and drinking brew
Thinking about that hanging, clocking my bank
And thuggin' with trues, foo's

Get ready for the Bone and the Mo' Thug
Bustas, you know me as a hustla
Try to creep and get beat
Maybe six feet, peep, gotta put them under
Straitjackets, gotta make that money, man
It's still the same now
Bailin' in my black trench vest
You gotta be down to bang-bang
Come and get this teaching
You soldiers how thugstas must stack
Me drinkin' me brew 'til me skull crack
Wig blew all the way back

[Verse 3: Krayzie Bone]
Now follow me now, roll, stroll off deep in the land
Well creep if you can
Take another swig to the brain rose
Loc'in, steady chokin' off that potent smoke
And running from the po-po now
Gotta get up with my thugstas
Right turn to the double Glock
Pull to the curb, smoke with my hustlas
Puff puff puff to the brain, shot
Love P-O-D'd and tweeded
Gotta get another case for my trunk
Olde English, really don't need it
But in case my trues wanna get drunk
They pump Bone
So leave 'em alone, you don't wanna get shut down
Thug runnin' the nine-quad
And you better believe they be running this thug style
So what now? See the Bone Thug clank
Thug never gonna change so flame up
Sit back and just smoke to the same cut
Leatherface on the creep and I came up

[Verse 4: Bizzy Bone]
Gotta give it on up to the Glock-Glock
Pop-pop, better drop when them buckshot blow!
The Bone in me never no hoe so
No creepin' up outta the Ziplock
So Sin sip gin
And Lil Mo Hart run up, nut up and flipped in
Then slipped in the clip in
Next click and me blood the victim
Ever to test nuts, to the chest and put 'em to rest and
But I won't test bucks
Put a hole up into me vest and
Gotta get through my soul but they won't budge
Mug, drug, me picked em
The blood in me running my mental
The thug in me stuck in me keeping it simple
The Thug in me running with thugs so
To the temple, buck when you duck
To the thuggish ruggish T's
St. Clair P's to appeal to the G's
And a buck to all my enemies

Wyclef AKA Preacher's son
Comeback with The Sword of Damocles, help them Jabba
Wyclef AKA Preacher's Son
Words from the belly of the beast
I never seen a man cry till I seen a man die
In the words of Scarface, again
I never seen a man cry till I seen a man die
Let's go, brrrup!!!

[Verse 1]
Imagine if Biggie and Pac never got shot
And they both still were rulers of hip hop
And Puffy and Suge was roomates from college
And Big L never got found in the alley
And Nas and Jay-Z they were still homies
Squash the beef with Ja Rule and 50
Hey! And Benzino shook hands with Eminem
And on the same record I heard Eve, Fox and Kim
And sometimes when I sleep, yeah, that's when I wake up
Yeah, I kinda hoped that The Fugees didn't break up
When they walked into the studio I prayed they didn't spray
Cause I miss that scratch from Jam Master Jay (Whoa oh oh!!!)
I never seen a man cry till I seen a man die
In the words of Scarface lord
I never seen a man cry till I seen a man die
Balong, balong, balong, whoa whoa whoa!

[Chorus]
Shots go off, mother's cry
Death since rise, homicide
Black on black crime needs to stop
You can't blame it on the game of hip hop
Cause what we say is what we see
What we see is reality
The ghetto's the ghetto you got them livin in sorrow
And they not promised tomorrow

[Verse 2]
Yeah! Hey!
Imagine if Big Pun was still alive
I could see Fat Joe screamin Terror Squad
Imagine if there were still four survivors still in Destiny's Child
And TLC never lost they Left Eye
Imagine Refugees never needin a passport
John Forte never at Newark Airport
The Million Man March, man, that was a start
Now I need a million more to meet me at Central Park
When the revolution start y'all 'gon have to play this
Free Slick Rick he can't get deported
I never seen a man cry till I seen a man die
In the words of Scarface lord
I never seen a man cry till I seen a man die
Balong, balong, balong, whoa whoa whoa!

[Chorus]
Shots go off, mother's cry
Death since rise, homicide
Black on black crime needs to stop
You can't blame it on the game of hip hop
Cause what we say is what we see
What we see is reality
The ghetto's the ghetto you got them livin in sorrow
And they not promised tomorrow

[Verse 3]
Yeah! Yo!
In the club never though Shyne shot the gun
But in the limosine JLO had to run
Paparazzi snap a shot through the mirror
That's when I saw a smile from Princess Diana
Back and forth and forth and back
Like Miss Aaliyah man do I miss her
The war goes on with The ROC and The Lox
Murder INC, G- Unit it's a fight to the top
Stop! We lost too many soldiers like Freaky Tah
While they get the cover of a magazine we got to die
We got to die, we got to die, we got to die
Lord we got to die, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa

[Chorus]
Shots go off, mother's cry
Death since rise, homicide
Black on black crime needs to stop
You can't blame it on the game of hip hop
Cause what we say is what we see

39,If You Love Me,"[Verse 1]
I don't wanna rain on this parade
But I'm starting to question the love that was made
I'm not looking for just an affair
Want a love that is based on truth, not just dare

[Bridge]
You will not hurt my pride
If right now you decide
That you are not ready to settle down
But if you want my heart
Then it's time that you start
To act like you're mine, in the light and the dark

[Chorus]
If you love me, say it
If you trust me, do it
If you want me, show it
If you need me, prove it
If you love me, say it
If you trust me, do it
If you want me, show it
If you need me, prove it

[Verse 2]
You see now actions speak louder than words
So don't just say things that I've already heard
Don't want your body without your soul
I don't want a love who will come here and go

[Bridge]
You will not hurt my pride
If right now you decide
That you are not ready to settle down
But if you want my heart
Then it's time that you start
To act like you're mine, in the light and the dark

[Chorus]
If you love me, say it
If you trust me, do it
If you want me, show it
If you need me, prove it
If you love me, say it

Prove it
If you love me, say it
If you trust me, do it
Show it

Oh I, Oh I, I wanna touch you baby
And spread my love, all around you honey
And if you care, you gotta show it baby
True love to share

40,Playaz Club,"[Chorus]
Me and my homies, we're tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game, that's how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the pool, or kick it in the tub
'Cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club

[Verse 1]
I got a ho named Reel-To-Reel
She got a buddy named SP-12, now you know the deal
We gets freaky in the studio late-night
That's why the beats that you hear are comin' real tight
Somethin' to roll to, somethin' to stroll to
If you's a player in the game this'll hold you
More money, more money for the bank roll
Stick to the script, don't slip in the '94
A lot of fools put the salt in the game
To where these women get the notion that they runnin' the game
Huh, I run my own, and I'm my own self-person
No respect make the situation worsen
Fillmore, H.P., and Sunnydale
There's a Playaz Club everywhere you dwell
Lakeview, P.H., and Army Street
A different part of town, a different kind of freak
I just wiggle my toes on a mink rug
And press play on remote at the Playaz Club

[Chorus]
Me and my homies, we're tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game, that's how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the pool, or kick it in the tub
'Cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club
(More champagne, Mr. Forté?)

[Verse 2]
From day one I had to get my money right
Me, Fly, and Frankie J, we took an airplane flight
Huh, they wanted to hear a rap, I said ""Alright, bet""
We dropped a beat, I grabbed the mic, and then they wrote a check
A few G's for the pocket, no hesitation
Took a flight back to the Golden State, and
Shops made orders from a whole new capital
The word was gettin' out, 4-Tay's out-rappable
Don't need a Glock, but I bought one just in case
A sucka try to stop me from pursuing my paper chase
Know the chase is on, because it don't stop
I got the beat and got the rap, you make the Glock pop
So treacherous suckas couldn't sweat this on a bad day
By the way, just in case you never heard of Rappin' 4-Tay
I'm on the smooth tip
Never trippin' on them suckas poppin' off at the lip
I pop the top off the drank and we can roll some dank, bro
Leave the gat at the house, bring some dominoes
Kick off your shoes, relax, and get a body rub
And shoot your mackin' at these women at the Playaz Club

[Chorus]
Me and my homies, we're tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game, that's how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the pool, or kick it in the tub
'Cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club

[Verse 3]
You can't resist it, but don't get it twisted
VIP, that means the number's not listed
Membership is based on clout
And how you carry yourself; now homie, what you all about?
I stack paper and kick it with the O.G.'s
Some got a nine-to-five, some took a lot of kis
You can learn a whole lot from a playa
A lot of these playas make a damn good rhyme-sayer
A lot of people get a misconception
And start drifting in the wrong direction
Miss Goody Two-Shoe, I'll see you later
I ain't got time, you ain't nothing but a playa-hater
I'd rather kick it with the crew in Arizona
They chop game like we do in California
Another show, another flow, a new bank account
But cash money comes in large amounts
So get your membership, but never slip to lameness fast
Or else Fly will have to tap that ass
And drop you to the ground, and make your knees scrub
It's just an everyday thang at the Playaz Club

[Chorus]
Me and my homies, we're tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game, that's how we do it in the Playaz Club
Check the pool, or kick it in the tub
'Cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club
Me and my homies, we're tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game, that's how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the pool, or kick it in the tub
'Cause we kick much ass at the Sucka-free Club

[Outro: Rappin' 4 Tay & Lil Fly]
Yeah, I'd like to send this shout out
To all the Playaz Clubs throughout the world
I know they got a Playaz Club in Chicago
Huh, what about that one they got in Philly, Fo'?
You know they got one out there in Atlanta
The way they be choppin' it
You understand, shit; Detroit, New York, Texas
Yeah, but we gonna move on down to these Playaz Clubs
Closer to home, like Seattle, L.A., Bakersfield, San Diego
P.A., V-Town, Richmond, Sacramento
Yeah, but a special shout goes out to the Playaz Club
Right across the water in the Biggity Biggity O
Yeah, and last but definitely not least, yeah

41,When We Dance,"[Intro]
If he loves you
Like I love you
I would walk away in shame
I'd move town
I'd change my name

[Chorus 1]
When he watches you
When he counts to buy your soul
On your hand his golden rings
Like he owns a bird that sings

[Chorus]
When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings

[Verse 1]
The priest has said my soul's salvation
Is in the balance of the angels
And underneath the wheels of passion
I keep the faith in my fashion
When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings
I'm still in love with you
I'm going to find a place to live
Give you all I've got to give

[Chorus]
When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings
When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings

[Verse 2]
If I could break down these walls
And shout my name at heaven's gate
I'd take these hands
And I'd destroy the dark machineries of fate
Cathedrals are broken
Heaven's no longer above
And hellfire's a promise away
I'd still be saying
I'm still in love

He won't love you
Like I love you
He won't care for you this way
He'll mistreat you if you stay
Come and live with me
We'll have children of our own
I would love you more than life
If you'll come and be my wife

[Chorus]
When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings
When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings
When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings

42,I Miss You,"[Intro: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you, I miss you

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Hello there
The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
Where are you?
And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on so haunting every time
And as I stare I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge and Mark Hoppus]
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge and Mark Hoppus]
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)

I know I vowed to never do this again, but, uh
I guess this seems to be the only thing I'm good at
Got something that you need to know
Be the realest shit I never wrote
Can't hold it, gotta let it go
Know that I mean every note
Yeah, yeah, listen baby

[Verse 1]
Let me start by saying that the way I feel for you has never once changed
And the games I played, mistakes I made leave me sorrier than you'll ever know
We got a problem, baby, I can't lie
'Cause lately, I realize that I
Never knew that we was on the same (playing field)
Knew that it was wrong, but we (let it be)
And I know you never knew when you said I do
That you would have to face all the (pain you feel)

And it's killing me, girl, that you have to live with this
Live with the lies I tell, live with the pain you feel
Knowing the man you love is fooling around
Oh baby, said it's killing me, girl
Said I just don't understand why you wanna be with this kind of man, oh oh
Why would you love a fool with all the things I do?
I know it's hard for you, hard for you to live with this

[Verse 2]
Trade memories for moments, trade love to be lonely
Guess that's just the man in me, blame it on celebrity
When the night time feel like the right time
And that spotlight feel like the right light
When it's really just my fears and I still don't dry your tears
When I say, ""She ain't you and I really love you more""
And you say, ""If it's true, why you do it for?""
And I, I really don't have no excuse
I break your heart, make you cry, I just wanna say goodbye

Live with the lies I tell, live with the pain you feel
Knowing the man you love is fooling around

Said I just don't understand why you wanna be with this kind of man, oh oh
Why would you love a fool with all the things I do?
I know it's hard for you, hard for you to live with this

[Bridge]
What I feel, I don't even gotta write it
It's like poison in my body and there's no way to deny
That my heart is a time bomb with seconds left to explode
But I gotta let you know before it blows
That it ain't on you, it's my fault
All the gossip and talk, behind your back when you walk
By the time you will know, before long you will see
That you deserve more, you deserve more
You deserve so much more than what I'm offering

And it's killing me, girl, that you have to live with this
Live with the lies I tell, live with the pain you feel
Knowing the man you love is fooling around
Oh baby, said it's killing me, girl
Said I just don't understand why you wanna be with this kind of man, oh oh
Why would you love a fool with all the things I do?

With my eyes open, there's no one badder, there isn't
Never left and I'm glad that you didn't

[Pre-Chorus]

Body like a queen
But it ain't about your body baby it's about your being
I ain't rolling up, but I'm on a high
When you really think about it, ain't no wonder why

I'm so down for you
I'm so down for you babe
(I'm so down, I'm so down for ya)

But I did it anyway

And then maybe some would say your life was sad
But you lived it anyway

And so maybe your friends they stand around they watch you crumble
As you fall down to the ground

And then somedayyour friends they stand beside as you were flyin'
Oh, you were flyin' oh so high
But then someday people look at you
For what they call their own
They watch you suffer
Yeah they hear you calling home
And then someday we can take our time
To brush the leaves aside so you can reach us
Hey but you left me far behind

Now maybe I didn't mean to treat you oh so bad
But I did it anyway
Now I'm saying, maybe
Some would say you're left with what you had
But you couldn't share the pain, no, no, no
Couldn't share the pain, they watch you suffer

Now maybe I could have made my own mistakes
But I lived with what I've known

And then maybe we might share in something great
Won't you look at where we've grown
Won't you look at where we've gone

And then someday comes, tomorrow holds
A sense of what I feel for you in my mind
As you trip the final line
And that cold day when you lost control
Shame you left my life so soon
You should have told me, hey
Hey but you left me far behind

Now maybe I didn't mean to treat you oh so bad
But I did it anyway
Now maybe some would say you're left with what you had
But you couldn't share the pain, no, no, no

Oh, no, no
Oh, no, no, no, no, no

I didn't mean to treat you oh so bad
But I did it anyway, sayin' now maybe
Some would say you're left with what you had

The blues has always been totally American
As American as apple pie

The question is why
Why should the blues be so at home here?
Well, America provided the atmosphere

[Verse 1]
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
I take a look over my shoulder, as I get older
Getting tired of mothafuckas saying, ""Warren I told ya""
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
With these funny-bunny niggas, ain't shit changing
Got my Mama wondering if I'm gang banging
But I don't pay attention to these father figures
I just handle mine, and I'm rolling with my niggas
Off to the VIP, you see Snoop Dogg and Warren G
Unbelievable how time just flies
Right before your eyes, but you don't recognize
Now who's the real victim, can you answer that
The nigga that's jacking or the fool getting jacked?

[Refrain]
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years

[Verse 2]
Another sunny day, another bright blue sky
Another day, another muthafucka die
These are the things I went through when I was growing up
There's only one hood, and niggas shit be throwing up
And I knew it, there really ain't nothing to it
Thinking every fool's gotta go through it
Now let's go back, how far, back in time
Dragging to these hookas trying to mack for mine
I remember when we all used to stop at the spot
Back then my nigga-name was Snoop Rock
It was all so clear, '87, '88, then '89s the year
You say everywhere we roll, you can say we roll thick
Way back then 2-1-3 was the clique
Something to stay paid I was just a young hog
Warren G, Snoop Rock and Nate Dogg

[Refrain]
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years

[Verse 3]
You make me wanna holla, get out the game
Too many muthafuckas know my name
While Snoop Dogg's serving time up in Wayside
I puts it down on the street, don't try to take mine
I had to reassure the homie that he wasn't alone
We'd talk, and him and Nate'd conversate on the phone
He kept saying, ""Nigga, it won't be long
Before a little skinny nigga like me'll be home""
I said ""Snoop, things done changed, it's not the same
We need to get up out the game
Cause we can get paid in a different way
With you kicking dope rhymes and I DJ""
Well as time goes past, slowly we try to make it
But things are getting hectic, I just can't take it
Should I, A: Go back to slanging dope
Or should I, B: Maintain and try to cope
Or should I, C: Just get crazy and wild
But no, I chose D: Create the G-Child
It's been on ever since with me and Mista Grimm
This shit is getting so hectic that I can't even trust him now
What would you do for a Warren G cut
Would you act the fool and nut the fuck up
Back the fuck up, act the fuck up
Niggas talk shit they get smacked the fuck up, straight up

Gotta give thanks to the funk when it's time to pray
With some fine ass dank now it's time to play
That shit from that ghetto ass bitch me be
B to the R A to the T
Just niggas and bitches on every side
Waitin for the chance to get funkdafied
And all they gotta do is learn the words of this anthem
I'll grant them if you can chant them

51,The Most Beautifullest Thing In This World,"[Produced by Erick Sermon]

[Verse 1: Keith Murray]
Y'all mythalogical niggas is comical
The astronomical is coming through like the flu bombing you
And embalming in your crew too
With the musical mystical magical, you know how I do
With word attack skills and vocabulary too
Come to hit you with this edition, it's all brand New
You're through, I'm interplanetarian like Doctor Who
(Who? Who?) So who? (Who?)
Born to get tripped on, word is bond
I'm kicking rhymes 'til the A.M. vultures swarm
Not Quincy, but I'm back on the block and not selling crack
Accompanied with the fat funk flows and tracks
So what you saying black, with all that yackedy yack
My artifacts can't be beat with bats
I'm saying, I eat up everything up on the menu
And bend you and send you swaying, to be continued

[Hook]
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya

[Verse 2]
Spur of the moment opponents is suspects
Caught up in precipitation reign of the tech-
Niques, I speak my concepts freak
The ichi ni san shi funk figures of speech
Now that shit is in the open, I'm open, hoking, scoping
Waitin for the next nigga to get opened on
And break him down like a organic compound
That's the weight of the world as the Earth goes round
Now, how the fuck you sound
I represent my clique, like a four-pound
You better pack your levodopa medication for the shaking
Meditation from the earth, that quaking shit that we be making
Never faking I gets down for my crown clown
Shaking the membrane of Encyclopedia Brown
Freaking the funk in any throw down
While you sustained to the sounds, up in you

[Hook]
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya

[Verse 3]
I comes down breaking ground
So back up off of me and sit your ass down
Now when I'm on the microphone I roam through zones
But don't be trying this shit at home
No matter what race, creed, color him or her
I comes cleaner than Jeru and Damage an amateur
As chronical facial disorders occur
I'll assassinate your character's caliber
I channel my anger, from the double edged banger
And turn into the microphone strangler
So stop tryna see where your eyes can't follow
Say goodnight to the world and goodbye to tomorrow
You rave and cuss so it's a must you get bust
We're not to be fucked with, Toys Ain't Us
For eternity, through infinity
I internally, get in you

[Hook]
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that, I get in ya

My chest I got my nut off
The type of spirit that can break your framework
The same by the end will stay the same
Hear the voice of summer
Zow za zow zow
But once I gotta hum a melody
That represents the type of flow I kick
When my tongue is swingin' like a drumstick
Of a jazzy type of lick
Everybody's got the lid on tightly
Afraid of what might be lurking right behind
And out of safety
So undo yourself and watch my rhyme go
Out of my lyrical chimney
But don't repeat my voice to the beat

When you hear the track again make up your own words
Cause the rhythm is a conduit to break a split from the homegrown
The well known is on to the unknown
See everyone's a firecracker like a phone about to get hooked up
And let look up and let look up and let whatever bubbles up
Out your head spread the vibes and illuminate the sky

Cause it's lucas with the lid off
It's Lucas with the lid off
It's Lucas with the lid off
Come on and take your lid off

She can still be a lady while she's coolin' with the fellas
An intellectual, beautiful, sexual
Hands on her hip but when she flips she's incredible

She's everything that a man dreams about
And when I'm with my crew, she's all I talk about (hey)
Fancy hair, jewels all flushed
Backside bigger than (her mom?) but don't touch her
Pretty skirt, you know the ones with the slit

60,"Sympathy For The Devil (""Interview With The Vampire"")","Holmes had read carefully a note which the last post had brought him. Then, with the dry chuckle which was his nearest approach to a laugh, he tossed it over to me.

'For a mixture of the modern and the mediaeval, of the practical and of the wildly fanciful, I think this is surely the limit,' said he. 'What do you make of it, Watson?'
I read as follows:

46 OLD JEWRY
Nov. 19th.
Re Vampires
Sir,
Our client, Mr Robert Ferguson, of Ferguson & Muirhead, tea brokers, of Mincing Lane, has made some inquiry from us in a communication of even date concerning vampires. As our firm specializes entirely upon the assessment of machinery the matter hardly comes within our purview, and we have therefore recommended Mr Ferguson to call upon you and lay the matter before you. We have not forgotten your successful action in the case of Matilda Briggs.
We are, Sir,
Faithfully yours,
MORRISON, MORRISON, AND DODD
per E.J.C.

'Matilda Briggs was not the name of a young woman, Watson,' said Holmes, in a reminiscent voice. 'It was a ship which is associated with the giant rat of Sumatra, a story for which the world is not yet prepared. But what do we know about vampires? Does it come within our purview either? Anything is better than stagnation, but really we seem to have been switched on to a Grimm's fairy tale. Make a long arm, Watson, and see what V has to say.'

I leaned back and took down the great index volume to which he referred. Holmes balanced it on his knee and his eyes moved slowly and lovingly over the record of old cases, mixed with the accumulated information of a lifetime.

'Voyage of the Gloria Scott,' he read. 'That was a bad business. I have some recollection that you made a record of it, Watson, though I was unable to congratulate you upon the result. Victor Lynch, forger. Venomous lizard or gila. Remarkable case, that! Vittoria, the circus belle. Vanderbilt and the Yeggman. Vipers. Vigor, the Hammersmith wonder. Hullo! Hullo! Good old index. You can't beat it. Listen to this, Watson. Vampirism in Hungary. And again, Vampires in Transylvania.' He turned over the pages with eagerness, but after a short intent perusal he threw down the great book with a snarl of disappointment.

'Rubbish, Watson, rubbish! What have we to do with walking corpses who can only be held in their grave by stakes driven through their hearts? It's pure lunacy.'

'But surely,' said I, 'the vampire was not necessarily a dead man? A living person might have the habit. I have read for example, of the old sucking the blood of the young in order to retain their youth.'

'You are right, Watson. It mentions the legend in one of these references. But are we to give serious attention to such things? This agency stands flat-footed upon the ground, and there it must remain. The world is big enough for us. No ghosts need apply. I fear that we cannot take Mr Robert Ferguson very seriously. Possibly this note may be from him, and may throw some light upon what is worrying him.'

He took up a second letter which had lain unnoticed upon the table whilst he had been absorbed with the first. This he began to read with a smile of amusement upon his face which gradually faded away into an expression of intense interest and concentration. When he had finished he sat for some little time lost in thought with the letter dangling from his fingers. Finally, with a start, he aroused himself from his reverie.

'Cheeseman's, Lamberley. Where is Lamberley, Watson?'

'It is in Sussex, south of Horsham.'

'Not very far, eh? And Cheeseman's?'

'I know that country, Holmes. It is full of old houses which are named after the men who built them centuries ago. You get Odley's and Harvey's and Carriton's - the folk are forgotten but their names live in their houses.'

'Precisely,' said Holmes coldly. It was one of the peculiarities of his proud, self-contained nature that, though he docketed any fresh information very quickly and accurately in his brain, he seldom made any acknowledgement to the giver. 'I rather fancy we shall know a good deal more about Cheeseman's, Lamberley, before we are through. The letter is, as I had hoped, from Robert Ferguson. By the way, he claims acquaintance with you.'

'With me!'

'You had better read it.'
He handed the letter across. It was headed with the address quoted.

Dear Mr Holmes, [it said]

I have been recommended to you by my lawyers, but indeed the matter is so extraordinarily delicate that it is most difficult to discuss. It concerns a friend for whom I am acting. This gentleman married some five years ago a Peruvian lady, the daughter of a Peruvian merchant, whom he had met in connection with the importation of nitrates. The lady was very beautiful, but the fact of her foreign birth and of her alien religion always caused a separation of interests and of feelings between husband and wife, so that after a time his love may have cooled towards her and he may have come to regard their union as a mistake. He felt there were sides of her character which he could never explore or understand. This was the more painful as she was as loving a wife as a man could have - to all appearance absolutely devoted.

Now for the point which I will make more plain when we meet. Indeed, this note is merely to give you a general idea of the situation and to ascertain whether you would care to interest yourself in the matter. The lady began to show some curious traits, quite alien to her ordinarily sweet and gentle disposition. The gentleman had been married twice and he had one son by the first wife. This boy was now fifteen, a very charming and affectionate youth, though unhappily injured through an accident in childhood. Twice the wife was caught in the act of assaulting this poor lad in the most unprovoked way. Once she struck him with a stick and left a great weal on his arm.

This was a small matter, however, compared with her conduct to her own child, a dear boy just under one year of age. On one occasion about a month ago this child had been left by its nurse for a few minutes. A loud cry from the baby, as of pain, called the nurse back. As she ran into the room she saw her employer, the lady, leaning over the baby and apparently biting his neck. There was a small wound in the neck, from which a stream of blood had escaped. The nurse was so horrified that she wished to call the husband, but the lady implored her not to do so, and actually gave her five pounds as a price for her silence. No explanation was ever given, and for the moment the matter was passed over.

It left, however, a terrible impression upon the nurse's mind, and from that time she began to watch her mistress closely, and to keep a closer guard upon the baby, whom she tenderly loved. It seemed to her that even as she watched the mother, so the mother watched her, and that every time she was compelled to leave the baby alone the mother was waiting to get at it. Day and night the nurse covered the child, and day and night the silent, watchful mother seemed to be lying in wait as a wolf waits for a lamb. It must read most incredible to you, and yet I beg you to take it seriously, for a child's life and a man's sanity may depend upon it.

At last there came one dreadful day when the facts could no longer be concealed from the husband. The nurse's nerve had given way, she could stand the strain no longer, and she made a clean breast of it all to the man. To him it seemed as wild a tale as it may now seem to you. He knew his wife to be a loving wife, and, save for the assaults upon her stepson, a loving mother. Why, then, should she wound her own dear little baby? He told the nurse that she was dreaming, that her suspicions were those of a lunatic, and that such libels upon her mistress were not to be tolerated. Whilst they were talking, a sudden cry of pain was heard. Nurse and master rushed together to the nursery. Imagine his feelings, Mr Holmes, as he saw his wife rise from a kneeling position beside the cot, and saw blood upon the child's exposed neck and upon the sheet. With a cry of horror, he turned his wife's face to the light and saw blood all round her lips. It was she - she beyond all question - who had drunk the poor baby's blood.

So the matter stands. She is now confined to her room. There has been no explanation. The husband is half demented. He knows, and I know, little of Vampirism beyond the name. We had thought it was some wild tale of foreign parts. And yet here in the very heart of the English Sussex - well, all this can be discussed with you in the morning. Will you see me? Will you use your great powers in aiding a distracted man? If so, kindly wire to Ferguson, Cheeseman's, Lamberley, and I will be at your rooms by ten o'clock.

Yours faithfully,
ROBERT FERGUSON

PS. - I believe your friend Watson played Rugby for Blackheath when I was three-quarter for Richmond. It is the only personal introduction which I can give.

'Of course I remember him,' said I, as I laid down the letter. 'Big Bob Ferguson, the finest three-quarter Richmond ever had. He was always a good-natured chap. It's like him to be so concerned over a friend's case.'

Holmes looked at me thoughtfully and shook his head.
'I never get your limits, Watson,' said he. 'There are unexplored possibilities about you. Take a wire down, like a good fellow.

""Will examine your case with pleasure.""'

'Your case!'

'We must not let him think that this agency is a home for the weak-minded. Of course it is his case. Send him that wire and let the matter rest till morning.'

Promptly at ten o'clock next morning Ferguson strode into our room. I had remembered him as a long, slab-sided man with loose limbs and a fine turn of speed, which had carried him round many an opposing back. There is surely nothing in life more painful than to meet the wreck of a fine athlete whom one has known in his prime. His great frame had fallen in, his flaxen hair was scanty, and his shoulders were bowed. I fear that I roused corresponding emotions in him.

'Hullo, Watson,' said he, and his voice was still deep and hearty. 'You don't look quite the man you did when I threw you over the ropes into the crowd at the Old Deer Park. I expect I have changed a bit also. But it's this last day or two that has aged me. I see by your telegram, Mr Holmes, that it is no use my pretending to be anyone's deputy.'

'It is simpler to deal direct,' said Holmes.

'Of course it is. But you can imagine how difficult it is when you are speaking of the one woman you are bound to protect and help. What can I do? How am I to go to the police with such a story? And yet the kiddies have got to be protected. Is it madness, Mr Holmes? Is it something in the blood? Have you any similar case in your experience? For God's sake, give me some advice, for I am at my wits' end.'

'Very naturally, Mr Ferguson. Now sit here and pull yourself together and give me a few clear answers. I can assure you that I am very far from being at my wits' end, and that I am confident we shall find some solution. First of all, tell me what steps you have taken. Is your wife still near the children?'
'We had a dreadful scene. She is a most loving woman, Mr Holmes. If ever a woman loved a man with all her heart and soul, she loves me. She was cut to the heart that I should have discovered this horrible, this incredible, secret. She would not even speak. She gave no answer to my reproaches, save to gaze at me with a sort of wild, despairing look in her eyes. Then she rushed to her room and locked herself in. Since then she has refused to see me. She has a maid who was with her before her marriage, Dolores by name - a friend rather than a servant. She takes her food to her.'

'Then the child is in no immediate danger?'

'Mrs Mason, the nurse, has sworn that she will not leave it night or day. I can absolutely trust her. I am more uneasy about poor little Jack, for, as I told you in my note, he has twice been assaulted by her.'

'But never wounded?'

'No, she struck him savagely. It is the more terrible as he is a poor little inoffensive cripple.' Ferguson's gaunt features softened as he spoke of his boy. 'You would think that the dear lad's condition would soften anyone's heart. A fall in childhood and a twisted spine, Mr Holmes. But the dearest, most loving heart within.'

Holmes had picked up the letter of yesterday and was reading it over. 'What other inmates are there in your house, Mr Ferguson?'

'Two servants who have not been long with us. One stablehand, Michael, who sleeps in the house. My wife, myself, my boy Jack, baby, Dolores, and Mrs Mason. That is all.'

'I gather that you did not know your wife well at the time of your marriage?'

'I had only known her a few weeks.'

'How long had this maid Dolores been with her?'

'Some years.'

'Then your wife's character would really be better known by Dolores than by you?'

'Yes, you may say so.'
Holmes made a note.

'I fancy', said he, 'that I may be of more use at Lamberley than here. It is eminently a case for personal investigation. If the lady remains in her room, our presence could not annoy or inconvenience her. Of course, we would stay at the inn.'
Ferguson gave a gesture of relief.

'It is what I hoped, Mr Holmes. There is an excellent train at two from Victoria, if you could come.'

'Of course we could come. There is a lull at present. I can give you my undivided energies. Watson, of course, comes with us. But there are one or two points upon which I wish to be very sure before I start. This unhappy lady as I understand it, has appeared to assault both the children, her own baby and your little son?'

'That is so.'

'But the results take different forms, do they not? She has beaten your son.'

'Once with a stick and once very savagely with her hands.'

'Did she give no explanation why she struck him?'

'None, save that she hated him. Again and again she said so.'

'Well, that is not unknown among stepmothers. A posthumous jealousy, we will say. Is the lady jealous by nature?'

'Yes, she is very jealous - jealous with all the strength of her fiery tropical love.'

'But the boy - he is fifteen, I understand, and probably very developed in mind, since his body has been circumscribed in action. Did he give you no explanation of these assaults?'

'No, he declared there was no reason.'

'Were they good friends at other times?'

'No, there was never any love between them.'

'Yet you say he is affectionate?'

'Never in the world could there be so devoted a son. My life is his life. He is absorbed in what I say or do.'
Once again Holmes made a note. For some time he sat lost in thought.

'No doubt you and the boy were great comrades before this second marriage. You were thrown very close together, were you not?'

'Very much so.'

'And the boy, having so affectionate a nature, was devoted, no doubt, to the memory of his mother?'

'Most devoted.'

'He would certainly seem to be a most interesting lad. There is one other point about these assaults. Were the strange attacks upon the baby and the assaults upon your son at the same period?'

'In the first case it was so. It was as if some frenzy had seized her, and she had vented her rage upon both. In the second case it was only Jack who suffered. Mrs Mason had no complaint to make about the baby.'

'That certainly complicates matters.'

'I don't quite follow you, Mr Holmes.'

'Possibly not. One forms provisional theories and waits for time or fuller knowledge to explode them. A bad habit, Mr Ferguson, but human nature is weak. I fear that your old friend here has given an exaggerated view of my scientific methods. However, I will only say at the present stage that your problem does not appear to me to be insoluble, and that you may expect to find us at Victoria at two o'clock.'

It was evening of a dull, foggy November day when, having left our bags at the 'Chequers', Lamberley, we drove through the Sussex clay of a long winding lane, and finally reached the isolated and ancient farmhouse in which Ferguson dwelt. It was a large, straggling building, very old in the centre, very new at the wings, with towering Tudor chimneys and a lichen-spotted, high-pitched roof of Horsham slabs. The doorsteps were worn into curves, and the ancient tiles which lined the porch were marked with the rebus of a cheese and a man, after the original builder. Within, the ceilings were corrugated with heavy oaken beams, and the uneven floors sagged into sharp curves. An odour of age and decay pervaded the whole crumbling building.

There was one very large central room, into which Ferguson led us. Here, in a huge old-fashioned fireplace with an iron screen behind it dated 1670, there blazed and spluttered a splendid log fire.

The room, as I gazed round, was a most singular mixture of dates and of places. The half-panelled walls may well have belonged to the original yeoman farmer of the seventeenth century. They were ornamented, however, on the lower part by a line of well-chosen modern water-colours, while above, where yellow plaster took the place of oak, there was hung a fine collection of South American utensils and weapons, which had been brought, no doubt, by the Peruvian lady upstairs. Holmes rose, with that quick curiosity which sprang from his eager mind, and examined them with some care. He returned with his eyes full of thought.

'Hullo!' he cried. 'Hullo!'
A spaniel had lain in a basket in the corner. It came slowly forward towards its master, walking with difficulty. Its hind legs moved irregularly and its tail was on the ground. It licked Ferguson's hand.

'What is it, Mr Holmes?'

'The dog. What's the matter with it?'

'That's what puzzled the vet. A sort of paralysis. Spinal meningitis, he thought. But it is passing. He'll be all right soon - won't you, Carlo?' A shiver of assent passed through the drooping tail. The dog's mournful eyes passed from one of us to the other. He knew that we were discussing his case.

'Did it come on suddenly?'

'In a single night.'

'How long ago?'
'It may have been four months ago.'

'Very remarkable. Very suggestive.'

'What do you see in it, Mr Holmes?'

'A confirmation of what I had already thought.'

'For God's sake, what do you think, Mr Holmes? It may be a mere intellectual puzzle to you, but it is life and death to me! My wife a would-be murderer - my child in constant danger! Don't play with me, Mr Holmes. It is too terribly serious.'
The big Rugby three-quarter was trembling all over. Holmes put his hand soothingly upon his arm.

'I fear that there is pain for you, Mr Ferguson, whatever the solution may be,' said he. 'I would spare you all I can. I cannot say more for the instant, but before I leave this house I hope I may have something definite.'

'Please God you may! If you will excuse me, gentlemen, I will go up to my wife's room and see if there has been any change.'
He was away some minutes, during which Holmes resumed his examination of the curiosities upon the wall. When our host returned it was clear from his downcast face that he had made no progress. He brought with him, a tall, slim, brown-faced girl.

'The tea is ready, Dolores,' said Ferguson. 'See that your mistress has everything she can wish.'

'She verra ill,' cried the girl, looking with indignant eyes at her master. 'She no ask for food. She verra ill. She need doctor. I frightened stay alone with her without doctor.'
Ferguson looked at me with a question in his eyes.

'I should be so glad if I could be of use.'

'Would your mistress see Dr Watson?'

'I take him. I no ask leave. She needs doctor.'

'Then I'll come with you at once.'
I followed the girl, who was quivering with strong emotion, up the staircase and down an ancient corridor. At the end was an iron-clamped and massive door. It struck me as I looked at it that if Ferguson tried to force his way to his wife he would find it no easy matter. The girl drew a key from her pocket, and the heavy oaken planks creaked upon their old hinges. I passed in and she swiftly followed, fastening the door behind her.

On the bed a woman was lying who was clearly in a high fever. She was only half conscious, but as I entered she raised a pair of frightened but beautiful eyes and glared at me in apprehension. Seeing a stranger, she appeared to be relieved, and sank back with a sigh upon the pillow. I stepped up to her with a few reassuring words, and she lay still while I took her pulse and temperature. Both were high, and yet my impression was that the condition was rather that of mental and nervous excitement than of any actual seizure.

'She lie like that one day, two day. I 'fraid she die,' said the girl.
The woman turned her flushed and handsome face towards me.

'Where is my husband?'

'He is below, and would wish to see you.'

'I will not see him. I will not see him.' Then she seemed to wander off into delirium. 'A fiend! A fiend! Oh, what shall I do with this devil?'

'Can I help you in any way?'

'No. No one can help. It is finished. All is destroyed. Do what I will, all is destroyed.'
The woman must have some strange delusion. I could not see honest Bob Ferguson in the character of fiend or devil.

'Madame,' I said, 'your husband loves you dearly. He is deeply grieved at this happening.'
Again she turned on me those glorious eyes.

'He loves me. Yes. But do I not love him? Do I not love him even to sacrifice myself rather than break his dear heart. That is how I love him. And yet he could think of me - he could speak to me so.'

'He is full of grief, but he cannot understand.'

'No, he cannot understand. But he should trust.'

'Will you not see him?' I suggested.

'No, no, I cannot forget those terrible words nor the look upon his face. I will not see him. Go now. You can do nothing for me. Tell him only one thing. I want my child. I have a right to my child. That is the only message I can send him.' She turned her face to the wall and would say no more.

I returned to the room downstairs, where Ferguson and Holmes still sat by the fire. Ferguson listened moodily to my account of the interview.

'How can I send her the child?' he said. 'How do I know what strange impulse might come upon her? How can I ever forget how she rose from beside it with its blood on her lips?' He shuddered at the recollection. 'The child is safe with Mrs Mason, and there he must remain.'

A smart maid, the only modern thing which we had seen in the house, had brought in some tea. As she was serving it the door opened and a youth entered the room. He was a remarkable lad, pale-faced and fair-haired, with excitable light blue eyes which blazed into a sudden flame of emotion and joy as they rested upon his father. He rushed forward and threw his arms round his neck with the abandon of a loving girl.

'Oh, daddy,' he cried, 'I did not know that you were due yet. I should have been here to meet you. Oh, I am so glad to see you!'

Ferguson gently disengaged himself from the embrace with some little show of embarrassment.

'Dear old chap,' said he, patting the flaxen head with a very tender hand. 'I came early because my friends, Mr Holmes and Dr Watson, have been persuaded to come down and spend an evening with us.'

'Is that Mr Holmes, the detective?'

'Yes.'
The youth looked at us with a very penetrating and, as it seemed to me, unfriendly gaze.

'What about your other child, Mr Ferguson?' asked Holmes. 'Might we make the acquaintance of the baby?'

'Ask Mrs Mason to bring baby down,' said Ferguson. The boy went off with a curious, shambling gait which told my surgical eyes that he was suffering from a weak spine. Presently he returned, and behind him came a tall, gaunt woman bearing in her arms a very beautiful child, darkeyed, golden-haired, a wonderful mixture of the Saxon and the Latin. Ferguson was evidently devoted to it, for he took it into his arms and fondled it most tenderly.

'Fancy anyone having the heart to hurt him,' he muttered, as he glanced down at the small, angry red pucker upon the cherub throat.

It was at this moment that I chanced to glance at Holmes, and saw a most singular intentness in his expression. His face was as set as if it had been carved out of old ivory, and his eyes, which had glanced for a moment at father and child, were now fixed with eager curiosity upon something at the other side of the room. Following his gaze I could only guess that he was looking out through the window at the melancholy, dripping garden. It is true that a shutter had half closed outside and obstructed the view, but none the less it was certainly at the window that Holmes was fixing his concentrated attention.

Then he smiled, and his eyes came back to the baby. On its chubby neck there was this small puckered mark. Without speaking, Holmes examined it with care. Finally he shook one of the dimpled fists which waved in front of him.

'Good-bye, little man. You have made a strange start in life. Nurse, I should wish to have a word with you in private.'
He took her aside and spoke earnestly for a few minutes. I only heard the last words, which were: 'Your anxiety will soon, I hope, be set at rest.' The woman, who seemed to be a sour, silent kind of creature, withdrew with the child.

'What is Mrs Mason like?' asked Holmes.

'Not very prepossessing externally, as you can see, but a heart of gold, and devoted to the child.'

'Do you like her, Jack?' Holmes turned suddenly upon the boy. His expressive mobile face shadowed over, and he shook his head.

'Jacky has very strong likes and dislikes,' said Ferguson, putting his arm round the boy. 'Luckily I am one of his likes.'
The boy cooed and nestled his head upon his father's breast. Ferguson gently disengaged him.

'Run away, little Jacky,' said he, and he watched his son with loving eyes until he disappeared. 'Now, Mr Holmes,' he continued, when the boy was gone. 'I really feel that I have brought you on a fool's errand, for what can you possibly do, save give your sympathy? It must be an exceedingly delicate and complex affair from your point of view.'

'It is certainly delicate,' said my friend, with an amused smile, 'but I have not been struck up to now with its complexity. It has been a case for intellectual deduction, but when this original intellectual deduction is confirmed point by point by quite a number of independent incidents, then the subjective becomes objective and we can say confidently that we have reached our goal. I had, in fact, reached it before we left Baker Street, and the rest has merely been observation and confirmation.'

Ferguson put his big hand to his furrowed forehead.

'For heaven's sake, Holmes,' he said hoarsely, 'if you can see the truth in this matter, do not keep me in suspense. How do I stand? What shall I do? I care nothing as to how you have found your facts so long as you have really got them.'

'Certainly I owe you an explanation, and you shall have it. But you will permit me to handle the matter in my own way? Is the lady capable of seeing us, Watson?'

'She is ill, but she is quite rational.'

'Very good. It is only in her presence that we can clear the matter up. Let us go up to her.'

'She will not see me,' cried Ferguson.

'Oh, yes, she will,' said Holmes. He scribbled a few lines upon a sheet of paper. 'You at least have the entrée, Watson. Will you have the goodness to give the lady this note?'
I ascended again and handed the note to Dolores, who cautiously opened the door. A minute later I heard a cry from within, a cry in which joy and surprise seemed to be blended. Dolores looked out.

'She will see them. She will leesten,' said she.
At my summons Ferguson and Holmes came up. As we entered the room Ferguson took a step or two towards his wife, who had raised herself in the bed, but she held out her hand to repulse him. He sank into an arm-chair, while Holmes seated himself beside him, after bowing to the lady, who looked at him with wide-eyed amazement.

'I think we can dispense with Dolores,' said Holmes. 'Oh, very well, madame, if you would rather she stayed I can see no objection. Now, Mr Ferguson, I am a busy man with many calls, and my methods have to be short and direct. The swiftest surgery is the least painful. Let me first say what will ease your mind. Your wife is a very good, a very loving, and a very ill-used woman.'
Ferguson sat up with a cry of joy.

'Prove that, Mr Holmes, and I am your debtor for ever.'

'I will do so, but in doing so I must wound you deeply in another direction.'

'I care nothing so long as you clear my wife. Everything on earth is insignificant compared to that.'

'Let me tell you, then, the train of reasoning which passed through my mind in Baker Street. The idea of a vampire was to me absurd. Such things do not happen in criminal practice in England. And yet your observation was precise. You had seen the lady rise from beside the child's cot with the blood upon her lips.'

'I did.'

'Did it not occur to you that a bleeding wound may be sucked for some other purpose than to draw the blood from it? Was there not a Queen in English history who sucked such a wound to draw poison from it?'

'Poison!'

'A South American household. My instinct felt the presence of those weapons upon the wall before my eyes ever saw them. It might have been other poison, but that was what occurred to me. When I saw that little empty quiver beside the small bird-bow, it was just what I expected to see. If the child were pricked with one of those arrows dipped in curare or some other devilish drug, it would mean death if the venom were not sucked out.

And the dog! If one were to use such a poison, would one not try it first in order to see that it had not lost its power? I did not foresee the dog, but at least I understood him and he fitted into my reconstruction.

Now do you understand? Your wife feared such an attack. She saw it made and saved the child's life, and yet she shrank from telling you all the truth, for she knew how you loved the boy and feared lest it break your heart.'

'Jacky!'

'I watched him as you fondled the child just now. His face was clearly reflected in the glass of the window where the shutter formed a background. I saw such jealousy, such cruel hatred, as I have seldom seen in a human face.'

'My Jacky!'

'You have to face it, Mr Ferguson. It is the more painful because it is a distorted love, a maniacal exaggerated love for you, and possibly for his dead mother, which has prompted his action. His very soul is consumed with hatred for this splendid child, whose health and beauty are a contrast to his own weakness.'

'Good God! It is incredible!'

'Have I spoken the truth, madame?'
The lady was sobbing, with her face buried in the pillows. Now she turned to her husband.

'How could I tell you, Bob? I felt the blow it would be to you. It was better that I should wait and that it should come from some other lips than mine. When this gentleman, who seems to have powers of magic, wrote that he knew all, I was glad.'

'I think a year at sea would be my prescription for Master Jacky,' said Holmes, rising from his chair. 'Only one thing is still clouded, madame. We can quite understand your attacks upon Master Jacky. There is a limit to a mother's patience. But how did you dare to leave the child these last two days?'

'I had told Mrs Mason. She knew.'

'Exactly. So I imagined.'
Ferguson was standing by the bed, choking, his hands outstretched and quivering.

'This, I fancy, is the time for our exit, Watson,' said Holmes in a whisper. 'If you will take one elbow of the too faithful Dolores, I will take the other. There, now,' he added, as he closed the door behind him, 'I think we may leave them to settle the rest among themselves.'

I have only one further note in this case. It is the letter which Holmes wrote in final answer to that with which the narrative begins. It ran thus:

BAKER STREET,
Nov. 21st.
Re: Vampires
Sir,
Referring to your letter of the 19th, I beg to state that I have looked into the inquiry of your client, Mr Robert Ferguson, of Ferguson and Muirhead, tea brokers, of Mincing Lane, and that the matter has been brought to a satisfactory conclusion. With thanks for your recommendation,
I am, Sir,
Faithfully yours,

Yo, I had this illmatic chick who would represent well
She had a New York state of mind and it wasn't hard to tell
She said guard your skill she was the most supportive
Until I caught her cheating with some nigga named Jordan
Life's a bitch and then you die that's why
I had to cut her off because I didn't half time
In the past I've been through different situations
Dominicans and Haitians, even Indians and Jamaicans
There was this common chick that just moved from California
But I thought she was a fiend 'cause she was always on the corner
She didn't know what love was or how to be faithful
She was mad I let her know, so I had to let her go
It was written on the note, but she didn't get the message
She didn't get to stepping, so I had to get the weapon
I told she could take it in writing or she could take it in blood
If you don't leave I'll put your face to the rug
Face it your done, when I found you was a crumb in the slums
I made you chowder, I gave you power
But I ain't sweating it son, 'cause that there is gone

My first girl was big, and she was ready to die
She had suicidal thoughts, and was a friend of mine
Warning, the doctor gave her, one more chance
Juicy, it's unbelievable that things done changed
Me and my bitch were set we had mad Respect
Lived that Everyday Struggle but would always connect
She would call me big poppa right before I'd shoot
But I had to bounce when she said give me the loot
My second chick was fine she lived a Beautiful Struggle
She had black girl pain, so we would always cuddle
She saw me at the game, at the park, around my way
Going hard in that Ghetto Snow, I con a date
As time went by, I found out she never been in love, apart from me
Chick was really jock-ing me couldn't work it out
Chick was really stalking me with broken glass so I said back up off of me
My third chick was Tical she had a PLO Style
Once the Stimulation hit man I drove her wild
She was all I need with her round Biscuits fastened
Drove her something crazy when I had my thing in action
And there it is, yea

I was cruising the town and the first girl I seen
Was Bobbie Jo Gentry, the homecoming queen

And said, ""I never knew you were a pickup man""

I'll be on the phone with a bitch that you will never know
So you can son me never
I don't get bitter, I just get better
And a verse is just a verse for me
I keep it generic and these niggas take it personally
If I was in a room and someone yelled, ""Hey bitches!""
I would never turn around cause I just don't fit the description
But that's just me though
But don't mind him girl, that's just Freako
Please don't cuss girl, that don't suit ya
His name 40 and his name Future
Oliver's here and you know me ho
I'm the cash cow front man of O.V.O
I am not doing features now, no means no
And the hate starts building the more we grow
Damn shame am I over-expressing the game
Should I hold back on addressing the lame
Because they becoming obsessed with my name
I'm trying to clean up my mess and explain
And boy you know my progression insane
My engineer is the best in the game
And ever since I've been messing with Wayne
People getting jealous I can see they expressions have changed
They seemed to love me when this shit was going nowhere
And now they got a bunch of feelings that they won't share
They just give me the fuck it I'm broke stare
And Drake was at the club and he balled like no hair
Living life from a whole different angle
Only see the road through the wings of an angel
And I can see the heart on your sleeve
And I know this shit is hard to believe
You gone have to get over it
And all you talking ass niggas get over it
And all you people that be hating get over it
And all you women that I fucked get over it
And yea I'm turning 22 get over it
You know you got to hear my records get over it
My whole team getting rich get over it
I got the city on my back get over it
Get over it, get over it

[Outro - Drake]

Little Brother
Pooh, 'Te
Big doe I see you homie
Yeah
I'm serious man, please, just get over it
Just for y'all I'mma keep it humble as a mumble in the jungle

It's Drizzy
Thank Me Later coming soon
Just lemme live man

71,Get Down,"[Produced by Salaam Remi]

[Chorus: James Brown sample]
Get, get, get down!

[Verse 1: Nas]
Uh.. uh.. uh..
New York streets where killers'll walk like Pistol Pete
And Pappy Mason, gave the young boys admiration
Prince from Queens and Fritz from Harlem
Street legends, the drugs kept the hood from starvin'
Pushin' cars, Nicky Barnes was the '70s
But there's a long list of high-profile celebrities
Worldwide on the thorough side of things
Livest kings, some died, one guy, one time
One day grabs me, as I'm about to blast heat
40-side of Vernon, I turned while he asked me
""What you up to? The cops gon' bust you.""
I was a teen drunk off brew
Stumbled I wondered if God sent him
'Cause two squad cars entered the block
And looked at us; I ain't flinch when they watched
I took it upstairs, the bathroom mirror, brushed my hair
Starin' at a young disciple
I almost gave my life to what the dice do
Yeah man, throwin' them bones
Hopin' my ace get his case thrown
His girl ain't wait for him, she in the world straight hoein'
While he lookin' at centerfolds of pretty girls showin'
They little cooch; gangstas don't die, he's living proof
The D.A. who tried him was lyin'
A white dude, killed his mother during the case
Hung jury, now the D.A. is being replaced
Pre-trial hearing is over, it's real for the soldier
Walks in the courtroom, the look in his eyes is wild
Triple-homicide, I sit in the back aisle
I wanna crack a smile when I see him
Throw up a fist for Black Power, 'cause all we want is his freedom
He grabbed a court officer's gun and started squeezin'
Then he grabbed the judge, screams out, ""Nobody leavin'
Everybody—""

[Chorus: James Brown sample]
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!
Everybody
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!

[Verse 2: Nas]
Some niggas fuck their enemies in their ass when they catch 'em
Weird-ass niggas who dangerous so don't test 'em
They make you disappear, this a year that I won't forget
Sold CD's double platinum, met mo' execs
Southern niggas, independent label, real killers
Know the business, ran Tennessee for years, now they chillin'
They had the coke game somethin' crazy
Sold music out the trunk of their car, that shit amazed me
Put me onto her-on blunts, sherm or somethin'
Took a puff, what the fuck? I turned to punch him
Southern niggas ain't slow, nigga tried to play me
I left from around them dudes, they cool but they crazy
Now I'm back around the old school that raised me
New York gangsters, we loungin', out in L.A. see
A dude wrote my dog from Pelican Bay
The letter say, ""Nas, I got your back, the fools don't play.""
I rolled with some Crips down to a Crenshaw funeral
Never saw so many men slaughtered and I knew the ho
Responsible; the nigga still alive in a hospital
Midnight they crept in his room and shot the doctor too
See, my cousin's in the game, thuggin' and thangs
He plugged me with a dame who was half-Mexicano
Gave the ass up, I'm a mack daddy Soprano
She passed me the indigo, but the imbecile
Shoulda never tippy-toed, thought my eyes were closed
Openin' the hotel room door to let her goons in
But I moved in a manner on some Jet Li shit
I let the hammers blow, wet three kids
See honey thought I had somethin' to do with all the drama
'Cause I was with a crew that had her people killed
Called up my cousin, told him I ain't fuckin' with you
He responded ""cool,"" but told me out here this how motherfuckers—

[Chorus: James Brown sample]
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!
Everybody
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!

[Outro: Salaam Remi]
All I really gotta say is that
If that's how our people gon' get down, how we ever gon' get up?
How we ever gon' get up if that's how we get down?
A shame when you really look at it
My folk against your folk, but we all kinfolk
Somebody got to make a change",Nas,1994,[73],1

Along a crooked path
Where the walls have fallen

I will not rest till I lay down my head
I'm gonna go

I shall not cry for the blind man I leave behind

Tell me of that place

At the gates for me
Give me the wisdom

74,"I Can Go Deep (From ""A Low Down Dirty Shame"")","{Smack goes to flip the coin toss. Arsonal and Cassidy get in an argument about who gets to pick ""tails"" as their choice}

[Round 1: Arsonal]
I said
Once again I'm here-

[Crowd]
-in another nigga's state
Up on another nigga's stage
Up in another nigga's face

{Some of the crowd finishes Arsonal's slogan while other fans boo loudly}

[Arsonal]
I said shit real, I know how baggin' a whole brick feel
But Cass', do you know how battlin' a whole Crip feel?
Who grip steel?
Revolver with the spin wheel
The kick real
Fuck a car crash dickhead, I'll really throw you through a windshield
Fuck ya accolades, I'm really tryin' to hear the pain that ya pen spill
I'm Nelly wit' them hollows, 'round here I let a 'Tip Drill'
Headshot, your funeral won't exist still
He got dropped wit' no service
Dickhead, now you know how talkin' on a Sprint feel
.40 bang on him, I give him that Shawn Kemp feel
How the dog house in ya backyard got a backyard and you strugglin' wit' rent still?
A bitch won't make it past first base if I curve her, unless she got Angels In The In Field
I keep a .40 below, a .45, you add the wind chill
Now you punch
Larceny? All I see is a bunch of new punks
I'd have you lyin' to ya mother bringin' money e'ry day nigga, you ain't even have to pay for school lunch
You up here lyin' 'bout shit that you ain't do once
My life? I'm like a modern day R.L. Stein, these stories will give you Goosebumps
I do this for the niggas who lost they lives and they played hard
You ever experienced that immediate family limo ride through the graveyard?
Where you so hurt, even though the sun ain't out you refuse to take ya shades off
You starin' at the tombstone, wishin' you could rip the fuckin' name off
Me? I know pain, I can get you John Doe by a no name
Catch him at the Chinese store, pulled two sticks on him, we eatin' Lo Mein
Nah nigga, Smack can't hear (hair) you, he need his Rogaine
Razor blade, dancin' down ya center this the Soul Train
I'm from where you had to pick a side and then defend ya block
Where poverty was real, we got excited just to window shop
I was you before you nigga, back when Nintendo drop
Bare knuckle brawls, my daddy was beatin' niggas up on Kimbo block

[Cassidy]
I don't believe you

[Arsonal]
You got two faggot ass sons to look after and you really tryin' to battle beef
Talkin' this 5002 and 0 shit to a nigga that's nearly undefeated actually

{Crowd starts to boo}

[Arsonal]
If I involved ya two faggot ass sons it's gonna be casualties
It'll be a Low, Down, Dirty Shame how I use that machete to Butch Cassidy
By the way, his two faggot ass sons' names is Shane and Cassidy
Bang! That's blasphemy
That's the main catastrophe
Stray bullet flesh wounds, so I gotta change my aim for Cassidy
I sit calm (sitcom) so I can puncture flesh not just graze (Grey's) Anatomy
If this was 2006 niggas would say, ""You really be spittin'""
And even though they took the shots for you, you really the victim
Nina on me, Smack asked, ""What's wit' the silly extensions?""
One bitch they all hit, that's a video vixen
I treat this lil' nigga like a lil' nigga and really will lynch him
I hop out on him in broad day, like he fit the description
Pure disrespect, while you rappin', I don't really be listenin'
Ya bitch want somethin' dark in her, I swear that Hennessy different
You get ya crew jammed up, I got my blue bands up
I'll put you down when we come in contact like this two hand touch

{Arsonal puts his hands on Cassidy and a scuffle breaks out between the entourages and delays the battle for just over five minutes}

You get ya jammed up, I got my blue bands up
I'll put you down when we come in contact like this two hand touch
Long beak on the bird, bing I let a two can' (toucan) bust
I said ""bing"" cause I didn't wanna say ""BAOW"" and get ya crew amped up
Cause now-a-days a ""BAOW"" is really all it take for the gas to start
I've mastered arts
I say I'm the devil in ya church soon as ya pastor talk
He in waist deep, I kidnap his son at the traffic stop
These punches outta this world, think slap boxin' wit' an astronaut
I remember bein' down bad, I ain't have a lot
Now I got crypto investments in comedy, mean I'm literally the laughin' (laugh in ) stock
Matic pop, let this nigga run for 'bout a half a block
My fourth and inches when I touch down? He ain't gonna make it to see when the next Madden drop
Ya bitch said my disrespect was what keep her wet
We repeat the sex
All you see is her apple on my desk, she the teacher's pet
You think we doin' yoga, downward dog nigga, peep the stretch
Long nose ready to blow, it's time to decongest
I keep a pistol, I shoot you and the bitch eatin' witchu
You come out the mall, I'm hidin' under ya car just to show you the beef official
This ratchet ain't tryin' to [?] no Felicia issues
So think Logic-al when speakin' on them ProTools cause I ain't finna Reason witchu
You got one statistic
You gon' respect mine or ya son'll get it
I'll leave him dead in the middle of Little Philly
But little did he know I overdosed wit' a TEC-9 (Tech-9), no Pun intended
Now let's get personal
Ya youngest son Shane? He got molested and ya brother did it
Shut up nigga! Yes he did and you just discoverin' it
What you tryin' to act unclear as if his uncle didn't
Bitch you can't spell ""unclear"" without puttin' the ""uncle"" in it
I've been #1 for 12 years, how I'm supposed to remain humble wit' it?
Chopper wit' a coolin' can', I'm in the middle of the jungle wit' it
Long hair don't care, and I'm feelin' like Rapunzel wit' it
You got a new born in ya arms? I hit stick, make you fumble wit' it
Torture you while the children there, I hurt your youngest children yeah
I put the recordin' of you beggin' for your life up in his Build A Bear
Make me mad and watch shit start flippin', you'll think Matilda here
This extension is high demand for this ratchet; it's Brazilian hair
Y'all sat him in hot water, like it stays on a silverware
I blend in they tryin' to catch me 'Ridin' Dirty' I'm Chamillionaire
Now when you into guns like I am, you make no mistakes
I got an SR 9C with two safeties but still no one's safe
If got a brush stainless steel slide that's one inch wide I even know the weight and density
And I know you gonna miss ya target if you hold it straight
So I'm ridin' wit' it, I'm shootin' all day, bitch I'm bloggin' wit' it
I hit that fag Cass' then that nigga Chubby Jag and his father wit' it
Then I hit Swizz Beatz non melanin, pale ass noggin' wit' it
Other words, I hit Pinky In The Brain just for ponderin' it
I'm here to snatch every bit of confidence from your conscious wit' it
Toss it to my man in the back field, he got options wit' it
Obama phone, really came in handy, I lined up wit' it
Cass' said he was a problem so I broken him down to Quantum Physics
Cave man, I go nowhere without the stick, I'm at the doctor wit' it
The baby in WalMart, it's in the cart bitch, I'm shoppin wit' it
Baow! Baow! Baow! I'm feelin' like Waka wit' it
His chest half open and half closed, this body optimistic
I put the baow in battle rap nigga, Ars' wit' the small dreadlocks
Y'all don't remember '09?
Should I yearbook picture a nigga, give him a headshot
Then BAOW to the back of the cranium, then his head pop
And once he hit the ground the Hulkamania Leg Drop
From a BAOW to a BANG BANG BANG, I think I'm Craig pop
Dead lock, Usain Bolt couldn't outrun these red dots
If you really want a nigga to suffer, fuck a headshot
Hit him in his heart, have him grabbin' his chest he lookin' like Red Fox
This will fuck up a disc, but not one that come out a Redbox
Shot him walkin' up the stairs, I shot son, the real definition of step pops
My shit is real, my shit is raw, my shit is authentic
And you can't spell ""bars"" without puttin' that ""Ars"" in it

[Round 1: Cassidy]
Y'all niggas hear me?

[Crowd]
Yeeeeeah!

[Cassidy]
Look, I brought this dirty Jersey nigga to Philly because I feel he a clown
Philly the town where it started at so I brought it back
And made bands like Ness, the BX where they started rap
But 2 Raw For The Streets is what started Smack
And who started that?
Philly nigga
Ask Gilly nigga it's all a fact
You in 'The City Of Brotherly Slugs' home of all the gats
When the law make an arrest you take a rest, no cardiac
You ain't got the heart to attack you should have a heart attack
I'm chargin' Smack cause I do a great job, I been the truth, I'm talkin' facts
You just bend the truth and come with straight lies
My little shooters keep it on they waist side
They small but straight ride
Right from the jump they'll bang on you; Nate Rob'
Yo I hate lies, make sure when you talk it's true
Before both my fists just bust both them lips that you talkin' through
Arsonal, let me talk to you
You soft as shit and you fraudin' too
For talkin' shit I oughta just split ya fuckin' dome in two
Actin' hard ain't hard to do
I brought some aluminum for you (foil)
It's beef I fire at ya grill until it barbeque
I got more heart than you and to spark at you it's an issue
Like that big bitch that battle wit' big tits, my shit's O'fficial
I grip the pistol then shots bang
Or Cave ya chest in wit' a bat to get jacked boy (Jakkboy) this how you Roc(k) chains
Remember Jakkboy had on Roc chain?
You got the same rocks in ya chain as that boy, we not the same
Boy I got a aim and a big nose that'll blow through tissue
It's (s)not a game
The steel cold if I unload the pistol, may His soul be witchu
I know B.A.R.S. who you wanna be Ars' that's why you stole those initials
Fuck who rollin' witchu, you never got a person hit
I spray the guns, don't play the drums but know how to work wit' sticks
Bitch you not a thug and you not the plug wit' work to flip
Smack, why you let us connect together? Like cursive writ'?
He a beta, I'ma alpha bet (alphabet) this be a 30 clip
This clown be jumpin' 'round on this stage performin' circus tricks
But I ain't wit' the circus shit I'm merkin' shit
It's not a personal if every person know you ain't gon' research the shit
But every person know he never had no work to flip
So to purchase bricks he workin' shifts
He drove a school bus, y'all could Google search the shit
Bitch, while you was workin' on the cheese bus I used to work wit' swiss (Swizz)
You ain't never work wit' these (D's), bustin' 'til you hurt ya wrist
If you Strapped In wit' a Bigga .9
I brought the strap and it's a bigger .9 than you New (Nu) Jersey niggas Tworkin' wit'
That nigga Suge look like he 'bout to give birth and that nigga Surf a bitch
He get clapped at but never clap back
Smack, you should book Surf and Clips
Cause didn't Surf just get booked wit' a clip?
That shit the perfect fit
And wit' the perfect grip on the Smith & I keep lickin' like a serpent lives
Yo certain shit ain't that deep for real
But certain shit like cheese will leave you six feet deep if I'm knee deep in bills
Yo I sleep wit' steel
Cause I merk cats, make 'em take dirt naps and they never woke up them niggas sleepin' still
For sleepin' on me, I'll spark the weapon like a narcoleptic on sleepin' pills
Y'all fall asleep for real
These battle rappers stay beefin' still
But fake reach for steel and go BAOW! So loud y'all think the beef is real
Bitch, you must don't really brush ya teeth for real
Ew
Get them shits bleeched before they think ya gold teeth a grill
The car where I keep the steel but the V near (veneer)
Sayin' he keep it real is like sayin' Cardi teeth is real

[Arsonal]
The fuck is you rappin' 'bout bruh? What is he rappin' 'bout?

[Cassidy]
Sorry Cardi, I'm a big fan, I shoulda said ""Hitman""
That nigga wear veneers too
Smilin' ear to ear too
For years I used to be buck but I had to straighten up
Just like Cardi B teeth used to be buck but now they straight as fuck
I'm tryin' to shake shit up
But ya ugly ass face keep fuckin' my concentration up
Plus you fake as fuck when I raise 'er (razor) up ya face get cut
They wanna hear (hair) lines you not a barber but shape'n up
You can't be serious (Serius)

{Crowd starts to boo/get restless}

[Smack]
Hold it down. Hold it down. Let him rap. Let's get it. Let's get it

[Cassidy]
It's already 1-0
Listen man, you been confused, lookin' in a tube ya entire life
And on bikes the inner tube is in the tire, right?
Ars', I'll ride 'til the wheels fall off, but you retired (re-tired) twice
Pump ya breaks, chump to be safe you'd probably ride a bike wit' a helmet on it
If I ride ya helmet gone
I clap the gats 'til e'ry shell is gone, we don't ride alike
Will he be able to handle bars or will he die tonight?
My ride is like you might not even make it outside tonight
I swear to God it's like, if the Lord ain't on his side tonight
His soul be rose in the sky tonight
Cause this guy be like, ""My shit is real, my shit is raw, my shit is authentic
And you can't spell ""bars"" without puttin' Ars' in it""?
That shit is fake, you just a fraud, that shit is all gimmicks
Ayo my trunk gotta pump, a Drako and a couple AR's in it
So if my dawg runs into cars see Ars' (C-Ars') finished
But don't take it personal pussy, it's all business
And before it's all finished, just admit it I'm dope, bitch I'm the GOAT
Now spit that goofy shit that you wrote
Pussy

[Round 2: Arsonal]

[Arsonal talking]
Oh my God. Oh my God. Let me hit the water one time
That's what I'm sayin'. That's what I'm sayin'. That's what you sayin'. They booin' you tellin' you ""time"" in Philly
[Cassidy] That's ya homie right there
[Arsonal] Maaaaan. Suck my dick pussy!
[Cassidy] He doin' that right now
[Arsonal] All these years....all these years

{Crowd starts to boo loudly and Smack asks the crowd to let him rap.}

[Arsonal]
All these years, now I can see why you was runnin' scared of me
Cause I'm the nigga that's gonna expose you ain't the nigga you appear to be
They told me take my time when writin' for you, pen it carefully
I said, ""Nah fuck that. I'm disrespectful.""
You gonna have to smack ya mother to prepare for me
On the Greyhound from ATL is how I move my weight
And I vowed to never let a fuck nigga remove my plate
And I never lose my faith
Check out at 11:00 y'all was leavin' 6:00 in the mornin' cause them underage bitches had to be to school by 8:00
My belt always a lil' loose to get a handgun drawn
I told you in the Face Off I'll make you watch your mother suck my dick in her grandson room
And then I put you in ya place
I do some more disrespectful shit like, dig in my left nostril then pluck the booger in ya face
Why? Cause I'm a loc, chimney weed, a hookah cigarette, I want all kinda smoke
I'm disrespectful, I'll walk in Kanye house and tell a Yo Mama joke
Fourth grader, hittin' the blunt, watch how this .9'll smoke
Stomp him in some Adidas and now he adios
Do y'all believe in a parallel universe?
(I do)
Kinder folks
Me and his mom was listenin' to his song 'Condom Style' when the condom broke
It's ironic you knock a nigga unconscious then he make conscious quotes
Why provoke? Somethin' out the trunk blew (blue) his whole face, watch me pop a (Papa) Smurf
We don't wanna hear them 2006 bars that you got for Surf
I'll put ya mom to work
Head back, mouth open she tryin' to drive the boat
Introduce him to a Heckler
Why? For thinkin' I'm a joke
I just wanted to talk, give him a pep, see (Pepsi) but he too busy tryin' to find the Coke
I flare 'matics, you reach it'll frighten niggas
This ain't Scare Tactics
Sleepin' on me? Long enough only gonna hurt you like an air mattress
You'll see an arm wave from a distance, think we was practicin' fair catches
Whether it's guns or bitches, we gang bang and we share ratchets
I got Cassidy, ohh, I'm in big man beef
Which require them big choppers, he talkin' Hitman teeth
What?!
But I got a pistol tucked in the linin' of my custom designin'
I light skin wit' bald heads but we got nothin' in common
We experienced different pains
The nigga you starin' at, mama ain't used to miss his games
But I ain't have no father figure for years, I only seen daddy in them picture frames
Every other night, auntie was stickin' different veins
I'm from an era whatever ya parents wish for, and couldn't afford, was how they picked ya name
You still AOL Instant Messaging, we got different A.I.M
When y'all see a nigga wit' the gift of (w)rappin' under a tree, y'all might think Christmas came
See now, the way I structure these bars is the definition of true writin'
I'm a true titan, walkin' through life blindfolded, followin' moon lighting
And Street Fightin' under new Bison
But when I pull out that A.R.?
15 nigga, I don't mean Ab so don't get too frightened
How you Tyson in this ring and they say I move like him?
In battle rap you mic'd in but how you Mike and I'm the one that tie my shoes like him?
Every clip a comma, period I don't use hyphens
Question marks who be talkin' the talk but still they move frightenin'
Now this expands deep
The way these crackers use us niggas and you can't speak
With a voice to inspire yo' people, that don't mean you woke cause you can't sleep
Over the years we both battled cats
But yo' style of battle rap is antique
It's either A. Kill him now
Or peel and get rid of him next day after, that's my Plan B
He want oohs and ahhs for everybody bar and y'all do extra
I've been on cruise control for 12 years, ain't no need to gas the nigga in the Tesla
It's funny, I'll put a Heckler to you heckler
Squeeze, then put a bunch of holes (hoes) in ya man chin (mansion) like Hugh Hefner
My preacher sellin' dope
Your preacher sellin' hope
My preacher sellin' dope
But when you in the position he in it's a sin to crack a smile even tell a joke
I ain't gon' lie y'all I swear to God, this the realest shit I ever wrote
I was a fan nigga
In high school to me you was the man nigga

[Cassidy]
I'm still the man

[Arsonal]
No you not nigga!
You was supposed to progress over the years and your talent didn't expand nigga
I really fucked witchu, I ain't see another level than you
In '03 I fought a nigga for sayin' J-Hood was better than you
But then you bitched up
$50,000, rejected from Mook
That broke my heart, nigga not what I expected from you
Thought you was Cassidy, The Hustla, with split personalities, who get get mo' cheddar
Come to find out he buried Adrian Reese
Some nigga in a 'Hotel' in a B-Boy stance, that's it, it gets no better
You wack!
You wildin'
5002-0?
You stylin'
Every time I hear Cass' verse I think Juvey 'bout to say, ""This for the '99 and the 2000!""
You lost a lot of weight, and you lost to the window of a Chevy
You lost to Goodz, you lost yo' fuckin' mind
That's four L's I count already
But them 5002 battles y'all they ain't all fake
It's just 4,999 of 'em that ain't on tape
See me? I know ya type
Lotta lip on you, you gotta overbite
How you expect to keep up wit' the new era? You was the prototype
I'm an outlaw, but when you livin' in the South, Paw you should know your rights
I sold coke, I got Proof I get Bizarre with that white, boy, bitch I'm Obie Trice
Now I could smack him wit' an open fist then choke his bitch
Then draw on Cass' (cast) but not how high school students treat a broken wrist
I'm on a crash course
I'll pop up in his future and take the mask off
After itchin' for it for six weeks tonight I finally cut Cass' (cast) off
You the type of nigga a bitch say, ""Why you lyin' on her cat?""
How you even expect that pussy was yours when she told you lyin' on her back?
See, I don't trust niggas who miss they target
Here's the proof in that
I got a nigga that's no longer my friend cause he missed the nigga we was shootin' at
I'm Omar Epps as J. Reid I told him, ""Hand me the grip.""
Flew to Philly to walk all over his grass and treat him like he's Stanley and shit
You used to be at the Sixers game actin' like you and Iverson family and shit
He ain't even from Philly, it took a nigga like Meek to bring this city a championship
Nigga, my shit is real, my shit is raw, my shit is authentic
You can't spell ""Bars"" without puttin' that ""Ars"" in it

[Round 2: Cassidy]
Off top, if the lead clap, you dare to get your head wrapped
Skull shot, bald spot, you'll never grow ya dreads back
Yo this nigga dead Smack, don't stop the fight
If you Hulk Hogan leg drop tonight the Calicoe pop tonight
He might've missed the punch but I'm quick to punch, so watch the right
If I steal him that shit'll cost me, y'all can copy, right? (copyright)
Dawg, I can box, I'm nice
Watch ya tongue, bitch I'm not the one
You said you ain't no shotgun so I know you never shot a gun
I shot a gun but never got shot wit' one
So what you got a daughter and you love her nigga, fuck her grandfather's son
This nigga daughter prolly stupid cause her father dumb
I saw a pic of her and couldn't tell if he got a daughter or got a son
You never gotta run if you got a strap
My favorite gun I gave to AR and he shot a cat, I never got it back

Yo quiet down man

[Smack]
Y'all gotta hold it down! Let him rap. Please. Please! Please! Hold it down

[Cassidy]
Tretch investin' in U-Dubb but ain't make no profit back
To make ya pockets fat you had to leave that league and rock wit' Smack
It's obvious who make the hotter tracks
Yo platinum might've been ya goal but I'm the one that got a plaque
You battled Charron and grabbed ya phone cause you forgot ya raps
You choked it's true, but if they see me chokin' it's cause I'm chokin' you
He choke a lot
His mom choke on cock, she be chokin' too
How broke is you?
Your house in Miami should have an ocean view
How much coke you do?
I peep you got teeth like a smoker do
This clown was in a Face Off smilin' like how the Joker do

Yo, y'all gotta turn my mic up man

[Smack]
Yo, y'all gotta turn it down

[Cassidy talking]
Let me get some water if I gotta scream for niggas to hear me

[Smack]
Yo hold it down. Let him rap. Let him rap. Let him rap. Let him rap
Let's get it. Hold it down!

[Cassidy brings it back 16 bars]
...But I knew that I was roastin' you cause all I heard was, ""Suck my dick! Suck my dick!""
I said, ""Dang, this fag emotional.""
I'll tell a chick to suck my dick, that's what she's supposed to do
But you would tell a man to suck ya dick and really hope he do
But I ain't come to joke witchu groupie
My life a movie, and I'm castin' actors
Cass' a factor, made a bag off Smack cause Cass' a trapper
The fact Smack booked me twice got you pussies tight
But look it's like I don't really give a fuck; Jaz The Rapper
You know how Jaz The Rapper don't really fuck so I assume her pussy tight
Look, I'm nice I'm not your average rapper
I black out, just ask the crackers
When I aim .9's I aim mine diagonally, so you could die in agony
And bang mine
We losin' when it's game time
Ain't possible dickhead, like tryin' to cum and piss and the same time
I don't bang slime, but can have some niggas touch you nigga, fuck you!
When I throw up some fingers it's not a gang sign
Lame, when it came time I chose a lane
Over change I unload them thangs, get shot in ya face; Novocain
Burn ya body up, then ya body what I'ma throw in flames
Can burn ya body up, it's arson, no remains
Listen, Ars' in no position to front
Know ya name Durrell Jones, you don't load and aim, you talkin' game
It's snakes in the grass but I'm on point like cobra fangs
Squeezin' like a boa constrictor 'til I got shoulder pain
This strap over the shoulder hang when I blam mine
Period
This pussy could fill his holes wit' tampons, I'm serious
I've been plugged in like a landline
And I throw up my hands you just throwin' up hand signs
When the hand .9 by the Jimmy, Jones I Just Blaze
It's a wrap if you owe ('Oh) Boy'; Cam'ron
Listen, I'll cock the Koch, it's a lil' K like ya man Shine
It's light but it sounds so BIG that I call the can' ""Shyne""
This type of disrespect you can't find
I'll make ya damn mom swallow the dick in front of ya grandmom
Fuck ya baby mom in the kitchen a bunch of damn times
Hittin' while ya daughter do dishes, I'm out my damn mind
If you not a fan, fine
But this clearly a decisive win, I got the type of pen that's so dope I could ghost write for Em'
I feel I could go to a gun fight with a knife and win
Until my god decide when my life will end, I'm slicin' skin
Stab you wit' the knife and then
Pull a pipe, aim and put a bullet right in the same hole the knife was in
Bitch, every fist fight I win
But I hate I have to fight a case cause a fake nigga fightin' for his life again
He get prescribed Vicodin and get a metal plate in his jaw so he get the nod if he try to take a flight again
It's simple and plain (plane) I let it fly when the flight come in, the white come in
You slow? Go to Google search and type it in
Yeah I'm nice and slim
Prolly don't believe I can box until you need a doc to give you stitches so the bleedin' can stop
Cause you gon' be bleedin' a lot
One punch to the jaw you sippin' lunch through a straw, regardless if you vegan or not

{Crowd starts to boo}

[Smack]
Yo hold it down. We ain't doin' that shit. I need y'all to be quiet while he's rappin'. Let's get it. Hold it down. Hold it down! Hold it down. Let's get it Cass'. Hold it down. Everybody on the stage. Everybody hold it down. Let's get it Cass'

[Cassidy]
Listen
I got a Calicoe, so right off top I'll have you chumps runnin' out the door like Brizz after the Mook punch
The last few months I've been plannin' this guy body
Cause bodyin' guys is my hobby
My body got a arm/leg/leg/arm/head it's a God body
I swear to God all I fear is Allah so why try me?
Cross me get crucified, why would I lie akhi?
You look like the Predator by prey (pray) on God akhi
They say if you starvin' to death, Christ be the savior?
But to survive akhi, if you was starvin' to death, could rice be the savior?
Yo I know God got me, I show God love but even the haters got God bodied
Time

[Debo]
We gon' turn Cassidy's mic up. Can you hear Cassidy when he rappin'?

[Crowd]
Yeah!

[Debo]
Alright, turn his mic up so he can hear him. Please

[Round 3: Arsonal]
Ayo, this shit is quite clear
You got booed in Philly, right here
This a nightmare
You should've punched me in my face when I tested you and ended the battle right there!
I said, I'm here to snatch every bit of conf-

{Crowd starts chanting 3-0}

I said, I'm here to snatch every bit of confidence from your consciousness
Since you tryin' to convince the world yo' accomplishments, I'm yo consequence
I ain't one you can intimidate what you poppin' shit
My passport look just like yours, I been to them continents
I said I gave back to my city for real I sit wit' the congressmen
I been had an eagle throwin' bullets before Donovan
I had real white boys on Smack before Solomon
I was sendin' Hollows through glass before Jonathan
Now if you so successful musically, why you don't go back to that?
He don't believe me his mother tried to suck dick through an Apple jack
Now if you so successful musically, why you don't go back to that?
Cause you can't
The only check you could generate is through battle rap
That's a Snapple fact
These bars, Drake dissin' Meek they comin' 'Back To Back'
This man? Con', I should sock him in his mouth, bitch I'm Cactus Jack
Soon as the lights go low, nigga that's when the mood change
I walked into Philly as Tity Boi, but I'm goin' home as 2 Chainz
My daddy was State Property before the Philly niggas used it as a group name
And in this sport, you will never pass an Ars'/Lux or Mook name
You changed
In battle rap we still treat you as a new name
But to this faggot ass industry you a lil' higher up the food chain
I'm from Ellis Ave and Hopkins nigga, Grape Street Goon Gang
In '05 I had a 5X white tee with a MAC-11 on a shoestring
Give me a fuckin' reason
Panic attack, he start to rush his breathin'
Last battle he got booed like it was cuffin' season
He talk a good game 'til he get his with A. Smith, but these ain't come from Steven
.357's, .9's, MAC-11's, I'm usin' all odd numbers to get fuckin' even
You are not the villain
Chopper squeelin'
Doctors willin' to fix him then I let somethin' big peel (pill); amoxicillin
I got a gun so big nigga, this the one I'm not concealin'
You got a Bobby Boucher mind, ya brain ain't do the proper healin'
Now go 'head, tap my pockets like you did Goodz if you want
I'ma let you
But what I'm a do back gon' be way more disrespectful
I'm special
Inf' beam on any skin, that's a freckle
That's true, I point this .9 at you (achoo), hope God bless you
I'm Ali great, heard you brought some Bloods to disrespect
I'll throw a BK in they face, KD and Kyrie tape
Back then I was Superbad, I'm talkin' high speed chase
I was 16 wit' a .45 I guess ID fake
I do my dirt alone, fuck a co-defendant
Know ya limits
You talkin' to a nigga who cereal box came wit' the roaches in it
Pain I was soakin' in it
Gang I was soakin' wit' it
Told you I question marks, I let it bang and now he open ended
I can walk around ya hood wit' all my jewelry on, but I choose not to
To avoid havin' to pop who might try to do me wrong
I got a shooter in the car right now wit' the toolie drawn
Since we in Philly and all my friends are dead I choose to walk around wit' my Uzi on
You talkin' ""Bars is back""
Nigga I had bars back when Biggie had a coogi on
What type shit you be on?
I'm still livin' the lyrics from his 'Juicy' song
Police try to call the police on me cause I'm tryin' to make some money to feed my daughter
That's right, cause I'm from Newark, New Jersey, a city where we can't even drink our water
While you was livin' your dream Cass', I was dreamin' to get a Dreamcast
I ain't even have a bed nigga I was sleepin' on a bean bag
While the roaches and the mice was in my room playin' freeze tag
You was on tour nigga, I was on the floor nigga
I'll invite you to the studio
And serve the clip soon as the beat low
He knock, I'm on the other side like
Put yo' eye to the peep hole
I said, when this smoke; bald heads, whole lotta chemo
This nigga stay on the line, he shoot a whole lotta free throws
But drugs ain't the way though
We know, they know
He start to scramble wit' the cheese, he get hit wit' the biscuit wit' the potato
Then he scramble wit' the cheese and I'ma let (omelet) the tre (tray) go
I push the button down on the toaster he brain pop out like an Eggo
I ain't ya Migo nigga
I'll take off on Quavo
No extension, baby .9's, it might Offset the Drako
A Jersey nigga, disrespectin' a Philly nigga
In Philly
Brotherly love is not our thing
But if you such a Philly nigga and you got respect for Philly niggas Why you ain't pop out fiend?
Like, if you really got so much respect for Philly niggas then why ain't you say nothin' to the Meek MIlly nigga about the Philly nigga we all seen knocked out [?]
Now that was a cheap shot...clearly...Tito's vodka
This tiny nigga could never get straight wit' I (eye), ask Debo doctor
I had Cass' lookin' for son like he Nemo father
Bars is back, I treat a mic (Mike) like I'm Tito father
I got my drink and my dutchie
You just beat a murder? People think that you lucky?
Nah nigga, people think that you a custy
But since you was loyal to ya team, in ya mind that's okay
See he startin' think like he Rusy
Trust me, whatever you do, don't touch me
I pull up wit' a stick under the pit, so it's musty
And the pistol sittin' comfy
I put my right hand up to God
My first drive-by was on the two pegs of a honkey
We was teenagers, five bricks, we was trafficin' out the Days Inn
I come from playin' Madden on the street, really tacklin' on the pavement
Made men, e'rybody gripped
Ya bitch gon' dress like a pinata for Halloween cause she let e'rybody hit
I walk in ya front door leave e'rybody hit
Even the family pet
Three rounds all bars, I ain't mention Gilly or no motherfuckin' tranny yet
I ain't even gon' finish my shit
I'ma just do it like this
I know! I know! I hit him wit' a hollow, how low, bullet in him
He runnin' off the stage like he wallow
My shit is real, my shit is raw, my shit is authentic
And you can't spell ""bars"" without that ""Ars'"" in it

[Round 3: Cassidy]
When you get a God body he can either can get the fire or six feet of dirt
A service in the [?] or a preacher church
A person that's deceased wit' the crypt keeper first
You can't meet death unless you meet wit' the Grim Reaper first
You know what? I'ma go from ya toe up shoot ya sneakers first
It'll kick and remove ya feet before you lose I'ma defeat (da feet) ya first
At least critique work before you take the stage cause the stakes is raised
You actin' like you want action, I'ma break a leg
Wait I paid a Smack fiend a half bean to have heem, shoot ya in ya calf if I scream the word ""Caffeine"" (calf fiend)
This nigga bitch and drag queen
Fuck the wanna-bes, my gun'll squeeze
And I'll silence the K when I'm dumpin' these (knees)
No cap, this an ultimate rap
I'll run this league
He got four figures they paid me over a 100 G's

{Crowd starts booing}

[Debo]
Hold it down. Hold it down. Please hold it down. Keep goin' Cass'

[Cassidy]
When it come to cheese, the ones that be trappin' witchu, be the ones settin' the trap so somethin' happened witchu
Better keep the police captain witchu
Or they gonna have to try to skin graph ya thong when the ratchet hit you

[Guy from the crowd]
Yo Gilly start rapping!

[Cassidy]
If I clap the pistol, you be cryin' hollerin'
But fuck it, when I bust it, I'm havin' a ball; Iron Solomon
Since I ain't followin' trends I've been convinced
Lames in the game feel my shit is offensive that's why they in defense
The industry is gay in a sense
Cause it's full of dick heads and assholes and ain't no coincidence
Ayo I be convinced
Why you claimin' a Crip block?
A fake Crip could drip real Blood if some shit pop
Cuz will need a blood transfusion he get shot
He'll see blood then see the crypt (Crip) keeper at [?]
My shit got, punch after punch from the rip Aak
And this chump never punch like Clips in his flip flops
When niggas get knocked they start snitchin' like Clips' pop
I got the white and use the same scale as the fish spot
I had ki's (keys), these niggas learn how to pick locks
I'm the kinda rapper, play wit' the D like a linebacker
The kinda trapper spray ya for free I'm a .9 clapper
Hollow through ya stomach will give you a spine fracture
If I stop ya clock I will not do no time after
If I hit my man he not a hitman he a contractor
He keep a gun if you need it done he'll contact ya
Ya get a private call tonight, the target dialed him all night
I knew the little shooter all his life, he like Chess size
But'll tie ya arms up to ya chest and you get chastised (chest ties)
Poke ya throat, cut open ya neck wide
Then use his index and his thumb to pull out ya tongue; Columbian necktie
Alright, well guess why this nigga so afraid
(Why?!)
Cause I'm connected like a unibrow and sneak cats puma style
Ya bro behave like a hoe behave
Get hit wit' the blade in ya shoulder now you got a extra shoulder blade
I'm underrated, but I'm overpaid
Since ya mom gettin' old in age that old hoe need to close her legs
Yo I'm so amazed they let a terrorist in
Who bared arms, I got more guns than the hairs on ya chin
And the ice is in the chain
I'm the nicest in the game
Just put a knife up to ya vein and just tear your wrist in
Despite bein' lame
You supposed to be Crip but don't know the rules of the street
You can lose ya teeth if ya open ya lips
And I heard that you supposedly snitch
Who knows though?
It's not like if you lie we'll suddenly see ya nose grow
Pinocchio
I wish a boy would (wood) lie to me
The toy could get allergies, then a fuckin' long nose blow
I feel, y'all still, can't fuck wit' my old flow
Youngin' I'm on my Benjamin Button you lookin' old tho'
The shotgun got double impact, but I hold it so loooow
So when it kick it lift and hit niggas' foreheads; no homo
I never stop grinidin', I'm rockin' diamonds the gold glow
And I'm prepared to do you greasy in here (hair); Soul Glow
But yo yo, I know you not prepared
Off top you gon' dread this loss Aak
Cause I got it locked in here (hair)
You should drop a tear (tier)
You should've prolly quit
Cause this whole round I broke down how you really supposed to body shit
Nigga you'se a bitch! Gotti shit
See these rounds; Homi shit
You tried to do a Geechi and hide, I shoot the tree down
Bitch I brought a 100 clip, you only came wit' three rounds?
Keep it a 100, you run wit' Crips but you wanna be down
The NFL signed Jay-Z and Meek free now
But these clowns forgot why Kaepernick put his knee down
See now, this round was called ""Body Parts"" cause this the part where you get bodied, you ain't play ya part
It ain't nobody fault
I caught a body, walked and ain't talked or call witness
This a murder yo but it ain't personal it's all business
And before it's all finished
Just admit it, I'm dope bitch I'm the GOAT
And they heard that stupid shit that you wrote

I want to hold the hand inside you
I want to take a breath that's true
I look to you and I see nothing
I look to you to see the truth
You live your life, you go in shadows
You'll come apart and you'll go blind
Some kind of night into your darkness
Colors your eyes with what's not there

[Chorus]
Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew

A stranger's light comes on slowly
A stranger's heart without a home
You put your hands into your head

77,Out Of Tears,"[Verse 1]
A year ago today, oh, nothing was the same
And I was sure it was too late
Thought I was a goner, dusty and downtrodden
Too forgotten to forsake

[Pre-Chorus]
Have you ever made a great mistake?
Have you ever made a great escape?
Oh, you turned me all around
Till I thought that up was down
When you lied so slyly to my face

[Chorus]
I'm not your baby, you did forsake me
And made me crazy for seven years
With all your lyin', did too much cryin'
Looks like these eyes are all out of tears

[Verse 2]
The dalliances build up till they leave you dumbstruck
And suddenly you're deaf and blind
You learn to love your jailer, learn to be failure
In the prison of your mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Till you're walkin' seven steps behind
Till there's something missing in your eyes
Then you turn it all around
And you see that up is down
And it's only in the nick of time

[Chorus]
I'm not your baby, you did forsake me
And made me crazy for seven years
With all your lyin', did too much cryin'
Looks like these eyes are all out of tears

[Bridge]
One for my dignity
Two for my sanity
Three for autonomy
Four for my time
Five for my arrogance
Six for my laziness
Wait, I'm accountable
Seven for my crimes
And when I said, ""it's you, not me
It's me, not you,"" I meant, you see

[Chorus]
I'm no one's baby, and no one made me
But I went crazy for seven years
With all my lyin', did too much cryin'
Looks like these eyes are all out of tears
Looks like these eyes are all out of tears
Looks like these eyes are all out of tears",Z Berg,1994,"[79, 77, 77, 69, 67, 60, 64, 65, 66, 75, 75, 81]",12

I sent you roses, I warned you I would
Do all that I could to show you the way that I feel
Please, don't say I'm wasting my time
I've got nothing but time so I'll do all that I can to catch
That ghost of a chance

[Chorus]
The sunlight, the moonlight
Are beyond my control
And there are stars in the heavens
That I'll never hold
But if dreams give you power
Then I'm strong enough to offer my heart
And never give up till you love me
Until you love me

[Verse 2]
I looked in your eyes, so bright and so blue
And that's when I knew that you could be mine
If good things come to those who will wait
Well, I guess I can wait if that's what I have to do

79,Strong Enough,"[Verse 1]
I don't need your sympathy
There's nothing you can say or do for me
And I don't want a miracle
You'll never change for no one
And I hear your reasons why
Where did you sleep last night?
And was she worth it, was she worth it?

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm strong enough to live without you
Strong enough and I quit crying
Long enough, now I'm strong enough
To know you gotta go
There's no more to say
So save your breath and walk away
No matter what I hear you say
I'm strong enough to know you gotta go

[Verse 2]
So you feel misunderstood
Baby have I got news for you
On being used, I could write the book
But you don't wanna hear about it
'Cause I've been losing sleep
And you've been going cheap
She ain't worth half of me, it's true
Now I'm telling you, that

[Chorus]
I'm strong enough to live without you
Strong enough and I quit crying
Long enough, now I'm strong enough
To know you gotta go

[Bridge]
Come hell or waters high
You'll never see me cry
This is our last goodbye, it's true
I'm telling you, now

[Chorus]
I'm strong enough to live without you
Strong enough and I quit crying
Long enough, now I'm strong enough
To know you gotta go
There's no more to say
So save your breath and walk away
No matter what I hear you say
I'm strong enough to know you gotta go
Now I'm strong enough to live without you
Strong enough and I quit crying
Long enough, now I'm strong enough
To know you gotta go
There's no more to say
So save your breath and walk away
No matter what I hear you say
I'm strong enough to know you gotta go",Cher,1994,[81],1

That shit cray, that shit dead, that shit fake, plastic head
Cassius Clay at his head, atta boy, atta kid
I'ma need a napkin, cook 'em up
And he gon' need an Aspirin, hook him up
Niggas was busy scrappin', put 'em up
I was too busy rapping, good as fuck
Niggas don't act like grown ups
When niggas don't get to grow up
Niggas don't wanna throw hands
That's what made me wanna throw up
But these young gunners ain't nothin' but young stunners
And niggas see you as come ups so niggas just wanna run up
Niggas asking, ""What up?"" I said on my soul, I'm a hundred
My niggas stay in the low end, the others stay in the hundreds
My daddy throw me the hands and my momma told me to love 'em
My neighbors told me they hunting, I hope I make it through summer
They stole one of my niggas, I should have seen that one coming
My priest told me it's angels, my niggas told me its nothing
I'm thinking about my nigga he thinking before he die
I'm going to war with fate and I'm going to war with God
I'm burning up all the papers 'cause all the reporters lied
I called up my lil' homie, bought him a .45
Brown boys are dying and none of 'em were for business
And all of em' love they momma and all of they mommas miss 'em
And this shit is just stupid, this shit is fucking senseless
The news shouldn't support it, this shit is getting expensive

I don't know why I sleep with my eyes wide

Hoping that I find you
And hoping that I find you

84,Biological Didn't Bother,"Yo, Yo
I want to dedicate this song to Philip Arthur Harrison
Word up
Cause he was the one who took me from a boy to a man
So as far as I'm concerned, he is my father cause my biological didn't bother

[Verse 1]
Biological father, left me in the cold, when a few months old
Aa father's child was greater than gold but I guess not
You brought me into the world but you're not my dad
Mess around with those drugs makes my moms mad
So we left you with no remorsal pity
Took the first bus from Newark to Jersey City
Woman and child alone, now that's pressure
Moms got to go to work, drop me off by Obesa
Momma, Aunt DeDe, whoever
Aunt Falma, Uncle Roy we stuck together
A year went by and I could walk y'all
Moms got that good ol job at city hall
She probably didn't trust men anymore
Until Philip Harrison walk though the door
Went out a few times but what about Shaquille
Moms offered him a million dollar package deal
She said you want me you gotta take my son
Or else its like a hot dog but without the bun
Guess what he accepted, responsibility he never left it
He kept it, he kept it
He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father
Cause my biological didn't bother

[Hook]
Took me from a boy to a man
So I always had a father
When my biological didn't bother (4x)

[Verse 2]
January 5th Phil made a promise (what's that)
He joined the army we moved to fort Monmouth
He disciplined me right from the get go
Age 2 bottle and my Mom shaquille let go
Actin spoiled, rotten, trippin
Got a butt whippin because I didn't listen
Back then you see privates made no bucks
Had to get another job driven trucks
Workin hard as hell didn't satisfy him
Had to another job working at the gym
He wasn't ""Gone with the Wind"" like Clark Gable
Work all them jobs to put food on the table
Phil's my father, daddy and thats the scoop
Can I go to the gym with you and shoot some hoops
Come on he put me under his wing
Was the ball boy for his little Arthur team
Sometimes he even made me mad
But it didn't matter cause I still wanted to be like dad
But a little bit better
Encouraged me to stay in school and to get then good letters
I wasn't a brainiac but I tried hard
Got to watch the Knicks play if I had a good report card
All types, all sorts
Disobeyed my dad and I couldn't play sports
I learned to dribble from right to left
I couldn't do a damn thang with all them F's
Age 15 father and son confrontation that's nothin
But father and son trials and tribulation
Back then I could under stand but I'm glad you did it
Cause now I'm a man
He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father
Cause my biological didn't bother

(chorus)

[Verse 3]
Look at me now successful for sure
Phil raised me well, to be an entrepreneur
And if you're making big dope be materialistic
Cause you'll end up another statistic
Everything's going well following my dreams
I dunked on Patrick Ewing
I want the ring like Hakeem
Uh oh what do you know
Biological ones on the Ricky Lake show
What does he want, does he want money
What people do for money!!!
It's kinda funny to me
He ain't gettin no check from me (check it)
He can go on all the talk shows he want
Phil is my dad so don't even front
He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father
Cause my biological didn't bother

85,I Apologize,"[Verse 1]
One day, the shadows will surround me
Someday, the days will come to end
Sometime, I'll have to face the real me
Somehow, I'll have to learn to bend

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I see clearly

[Chorus]
All these times, I simply stepped aside
I watched but never really listened
As the whole world passed me by
All this time, I watched from the outside
Never understood what was wrong or what was right
I apologize, whoa oh, oh-oh, oh oh
I apologize, whoa oh, oh-oh, oh oh

[Verse 2]
One day, I'll face the hell inside me
Someday, I'll accept what I have done
Sometime, I'll leave the past behind me
For now I accept who I've become

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I see clearly

[Chorus]
All these times, I simply stepped aside
I watched but never really listened
As the whole world passed me by
All this time, I watched from the outside
Never understood what was wrong or what was right
I apologize, I apologize

[Bridge]
One day, the shadows will surround me

[Chorus]
All these times, I simply stepped aside
I watched but never really listened
As the whole world passed me by
All this time, I watched from the outside
Never understood what was wrong or what was right
I apologize, I apologize

Whoa oh, oh-oh, oh oh, I apologize
Whoa oh, oh-oh, oh oh, I apologize
Whoa oh, oh-oh, oh oh, I apologize
Whoa oh, oh-oh, oh oh, I apologize

86,Picture Postcards From L.A.,"I'm the piano player down at Eddie's bar
And Rachel she's the waitress who wants to be a star
She swears she's gonna make it, make it big someday
And she'll send me picture postcards from L.A

When it's time for closing, I play while Rachel cleans
She listens to my music, I listen to her dreams
She swears she's gonna make it, she's going all the way
And I say, ""Send me picture postcards from L.A

""Send me postcards from L.A. signed with love forevermore
Picture postcards from L.A. to hang on my refrigerator door
Rachel, if you find me one, I'd love a picture of the California sun""

When Rachel shares my pillow she always asks me things
Like do I really think she's pretty, do I like the way she sings?
I don't know how to answer, so I always smile and say
I say, ""Send me picture postcards from L.A

""Send me postcards from L.A. signed with love forevermore
Picture postcards from L.A. to hang on my refrigerator door
Rachel, if you find me one, I'd love a picture of the California sun""

Sometimes Rachel stands up in the middle of the bar
And does a scene from the late show
We all clap our hands as she puts her apron on
And says, ""Next week, I'm gonna go.""

She'll even buy a ticket and pack her things to leave
Though we all know the story we pretend that we believe
But something always comes up, something always makes her stay
And still no picture postcards from L.A

""Send me postcards from L.A. signed with love forevermore
Picture postcards from L.A. to hang on my refrigerator door
Rachel, if you find me one, I'd love a picture of the California sun""

I'm the piano player down at Eddie's bar

87,Whutcha Want?,"[Verse 1]
I gets banned if I do gets banned if I don't
So sometimes I will and sometimes I won't
Puff mad stick crack a forty down the back
Sit fat and relax and plan my attack
Not the one to test I possess mad finesse
My Buddha was blessed one bird in the nest
Chills with my peeps steady bouncing in Jeeps
On the New York streets hittin' urban concrete
I'm the man untestable, with the extra-
Terrestrial flow, Four Fifty Six Cee-Lo
Pop the top off the forty ounce bottle
I'm not the one to follow, I'm not the role model
Hollow tips in my clips money grip and my Glock
Only spits when I react to the bullshit
So give me room to breathe and get up off DEEZ
And save the confessions for JEESuz
Plus I don't need to hear no sorrow
Eff it, the sun will still come out tomorrow
Long as I'm breathing, needing, even like
Steven, achieving, gettin some cheese and
Representin' lovely, Boogie Down Bronx major
With the project flavor, I made ya
Daze ya, my behavior is mad ill if you front
You know what I want!

[Chorus]
(Whutcha want Nine?) Fat beats for my rhymes
(So whutcha want Nine?) Mad clips for my nines
(So whutcha want Nine?) A ill posse
And my name up in lights, N-I-N-E

[Verse 2]
I'mma let you know how I feel on the real, I pack
Steel, it's like a jungle, makes me wonder where my heel hits the
Bricks, skips the dog shit, completin' my cipher
Temper like Rowdy Roddy Piper, hyper like a
Viper, I'mma strike if I gotta
Goin' for the jugular stretch you like a copper stoppah
Stoppah, but you can't stop me
Just clock me, just watch me blow up the spot G
Came a long way from back in the day
We did it for no pay, just rhymin' hit the hay and
Sleep, wake up, write another rhyme
Hit the park after dark, drop the beat one time
That's when shit was real, no phonies no bologna
Just a homie, mics and wheels of steel
Backup from the roof, amp plugged in the street light
Everything right, jam over: street fight
Back to the lab I grab my pen and pad
Raw lyrics make a sore and a scab
Had no dinero, enough get fo' chicken wings and rice
A forty ounce a nickel bag to get nice
And now I might make a million, and still son
It makes the heart pump, you know what I want

[Chorus]
(Whutcha want Nine?) Fat beats for my rhymes
(So whutcha want Nine?) Mad clips for my nines
(So whutcha want Nine?) A ill posse
And my name up in lights, N-I-N-E

Be like Elmer J. Fudd with the mansion and the yacht
Brand new Glock non-stop hip-hop
Remote control boombox lampin' on my dresser
The God ain't no lesser as the pressure comes to test ya
Hundred pound weight around the neck, daily
Nuff treasons, nuff reasons like Philip Bailey
Can't get enough of that funky stuff
Rhymin' astronomical, original, shit is phenomenal
Heat up the ghetto put the pedal to the metal
Speed like Racer treat you like a wack rhyme and erase ya
Right off the paper, roll a big fat spliff
Four-fifth on the hip, Heineken in the grip shit
I'm ready, get the keys for the Jeep, let's bounce
Cruise avenues, get some brews and sing the blues with the
Funkmaster Flex cassette in the deck
I'm in effect I move my neck while Son gets wreck
Oh what a feeling, I'm on the wheels of steel and
I snatch up some skins for some sexual healing
Erything's kosher copacetic, groovy hip-hop moves me
Soothes me, I'm letting off like an Uzi
But first steps a doozy and bruise me
Now I'm choosy before I start to freak it like a floozy
I wanna get big get paid true stunt
You know what I want!

We're getting old now
But I don’t feel it
I say you're beautiful
And I still mean it
And I don't wanna know
What old age feels like
So promise me you won’t
Give up on this life

[Pre-Chorus]
And we'll be busy tryin'
While the rest of them are dyin'

Promise me we'll never grow up
I don't wanna let go
I wanna stay young
And even when the wrinkles show up
We'll be laughing, and
We can play forever, don't make me face the truth

[Verse 2]
I think it’s obvious
That we’ll stay happy
'Cause I’m the happiest
When you smile at me
And we won't end the same
A broken family
I'll never walk away
Without you with me

[Pre-Chorus]
And times are getting harder
But I'm nothing like my father

Promise me we’ll never grow up
I don't wanna fall out
I wanna make love
And even when we can't, so what?
We're together, and
Happy ever after, don't make me face the truth

That I'm dying soon
That we're dying

Don't say goodbye
(When did we get so old, so old, so old?)
We're so much older
All I want is one more life with you
When did we get so old?
Why'd you get so sick?
And how could you die?

[Chorus]
You promised me you'd never grow up
Now I have to let go
God, I miss you so much
And even when your heart gave out
I was thinkin' how
I won't say goodbye
You promised me you'd never grow up
But you fucking grew up
God, I miss you so much
And even when your heart gave out
I was thinkin' I'd
Love you 'til forever, and I can't face the truth

91,Pimp Of The Year,"[Intro]
Mack playas, ballas, grindas
Yeah I'm the real true pimp of the year
Will ya feel me
Ha ha, pimp of the mutha' fuckin' year

[Verse 1]
Give it up give it up a give it to me
A big mack capitalized Double D, see
And it's on, so I'ma get sick with it
A give me drank and bomb and let me get with it
Yeeyah, cause I'm gonna be the biggest pimp of the year
Goin' around doin' shit like this here
Cause a nigga is strong
And way too long when it comes to my ding dong
But, bet, I get a check when I sign on the dotted line
So now I know I gotta get mine
It's really no thang to me
See, to be a real true P.I.M.P
Cause I had me a ho or two or mo'
Way back in 80 fuckin' 4
That's when I was a teen
But my dick was still big to make a bitch bleed, see
And of coarse I'm slappin' hoes
Smackin' hoes, up and down the fuckin' avenues
And ever I do that
I dig a deep in the pocket for the fat gat
Feel me. I'm so goddamn bad
That I had to kick off in a ho's ass
Cause the girl tried to do me
Ride of with her man in the mustang pony
And I know it'd catch up with her
Next day in the paper, yeah, the nigga raped her
But I'm not trippin'
Bitches like you wanna keep on slippin'
So I had to move on
To the next young bitch that had it goin' on
Ugh, and I'm not here to pump no fear
I'm just the mack playa' pimp of the year, bitch

[Hook]
Pimp, pimp on... You got all the ladies
Pimp, pimp on... You got all the ladies

[Verse 2]
First thang first on the second verse
I learned a hell of a lot
A get from the get down start
So I had my hoes hoin'
Had every tramp thinkin' I was the orthidano goin'
Cause all the game I spit is good shit
And the shit that I spit made me rich
Cause I was all about money
If the girl says she down, well bees come and get the honey
Cause I'm givin' it up quick
Take a hit, take a lick at them pink lips
Uh, and a bet is better than grey
Not knowin' that I bought this broad out of state
And I met her in Mentley
Lookin' just like the actress singer Whitney
But I knew she was a fake one
But to me young bra' it didn't really make me none
I just walked up to her
I said my name's Dru Down and I'll Slick Rick the ruler
And from the get go
I'm just a pimp, ho, ya comin' with me, a to the east side O
And then she said, ""Okay
I'm on my way, let me pack my bags before today""
Yeeyah, then I said, ""Get with it
And don't be a bitch and try to split""
Uh, She was right up under my wing
At the airport at 5:15
She said ""Who are you and why are ya here?""
I said I'm Dru Down and pimp of the year

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I've got a thang for makin' hoes
Every woman that I touch bitch turns into gold
And I don't go for talk back
Have respect when ya speakin' to a pimp fuck that
Deduct from the paycheck
Matter of fact get yo ass in the back of the Cadillac
So I can ride and checkmate
Like rule number eight I keep a bitch in a plate
And no I don't play around, fuck around
A when it comes to my money, nigga
And when it comes to gettin' a bitch sprung
I give her Hennessy, a with the one on one
So she can get so high, real high
And that she that knows I'm that type a guy
Cause I'm a kick something just for the hoes
And for myself I keep indo'

92,You Suck,"I know you're really proud,'cause you think you're well hung
But I think it's time you learn how to use your tongue
You say you want things to be even and you want things to be fair
But you're afraid to get your teeth caught in my pubic hair
If you're lying there expecting me to suck your dick
You're going to have to give me more than just a token lick
Well, you may not like it but you better learn how
'Cause it's your turn now
Now, you suck, suck it hard, go down, baby
You suck, lick it hard and move your tongue around
If you're worried about babies, you can lower your risk
By giving me that special cunnilingus kiss
It's on your face that I'm gonna sit
You can wiggle, you can jiggle your tongue on my clit
Don't worry about making me have an orgasm
Just take your time and do it with enthusiasm
I can tell it's making you scared just thinking of it
But you better learn to love it
Now, you suck, suck it hard, go down, baby
You suck, lick it hard and move your tongue around
Now, you suck, suck it hard, go down, baby
You suck, lick it hard and move your tongue around
When you hear safe sex, snicker under your breath
We got to take cover, we're flirting with death
AIDS is our problem, we've got to talk
Break out your dental dam and your Latex sock
I'm your Latex lover wrapped like a gift
Got my microwave plastic wrap heating up my clit
Dinners on, get busy with my booty
Got a couple of flavors, sweet licorice and fruity
I know you're sad, luscious pussy with a cover
I'm aching, too, we can't taste each other
There's no slacking off with an unprotected stroke
This ain't no joke
Sisters, sisters you've got the power, use it
{You brought a condom, right?
Huh?
I'm unprotected
Ain't you on the pill?}
{Oh, that was great and everything, but you know
I think it's your turn to go down on me
I'm tired, I'm tired
What do you mean your tired?
Come on baby, come on
No, no, that's awful, that taste terrible
You asshole, you shit}
Well, I know you think it's a real drag
To suck my cunt when I'm on the rag
Quit making up stories, yeah give me a break
'Cause I really don't believe that you got a headache
You tell me it's gross to suck my yeast infection
How do you think I feel when I gag on your erection?
Your wasting your tongue with lame excuses and lies
Get your face between my thighs
Now, you suck, suck it hard, go down, baby
You suck, lick it hard and move your tongue around
Now, you suck, suck it hard, go down, baby
You suck, lick it hard and move your tongue around
Now, you suck",Consolidated,1994,"[94, 89, 89]",3

Foggy emotions, moments, erosion

94,Breakdown,"[Verse 1]
Yeah
Yeah

Look, I just shed tears homie and no I ain't too proud to admit it
Just seen my father for the first time in a minute
When I say a minute I mean years man
Damn, a whale could have swam in them tears fam
Cause as I left em' I reflected on my younger days
When it was just me and my brother and my mother played
Father, ‘cause no other man bothered
Not even my biological, it never seemed logical
But I accepted it 'cause I ain't know no better
Thought I was brighter than a Polo sweater
No pops was like Martin with no Coretta
So many things you could have told me
And saved me the trouble of letting my mistakes show me
I feel like you barely know me
And that's a shame ‘cause our last name is the same
That blood type flowing through our veins is the same
My mama left you and it may be that anger's to blame
But that's no excuse, only you and God know the truth
And why you only call monthly, barely ever saw me
Spend some summers with you and played with my cousin Maury
Maybe I should be telling you “fuck you” ‘cause you selfish
But I want a father so bad, I can't help but...

Break down
I break down
Can't help but break down
I break down

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I never thought I'd see my mama on that shit, man
It's fucking with her body, now she sick, damn
I wanted a big house with a white picket fence and a pool
Who would have ever thought that it would come to this, man?
Quicksand is what this life feel like
That shit these rappers kick is nothing like real life
You made a milli off of serving hard white? Yeah right
My mama tell you what addicted to that pipe feel like
Stupid niggas, I heard the cops be shooting niggas
I swear to God, wish I could bulletproof my niggas
Can't get no jobs, but they still recruiting niggas
We trying to stand tall when it get too crucial niggas

Break down, we break down
We break down, we break down
Break the break down

[Verse 3]
Yeah, He's serving time, locked down
And she don't want nobody to know
His daughter 25 pounds
By the time he get out, she gon' be 4
Now will his girl stay down?
Ain't no doubt she love him, yeah that's for sure
But temptation stays round
And if she strayed, how could he ever know? Never know
And so, she goes to the club on the weekend
A little freaking, but them niggas holla, but she never speakin'
But tonight I see the devil creeping
'Cause she been lonely, she ain't felt a man in seven seasons
Damn! She doin the best that she can
Her mama tellin' her to find another man
She college educated with a felon boyfriend
That's what she thinkin' tonight
Maybe she's right, but please

Stay down mama
Gotta be strong, don't break down mama
Please
Stay down mama

Let's get out of this town, baby, we're on fire
Everyone around here seems to be going down, down, down
If you stick with me, I can take you higher and higher

Nobody's found, found, found
I got so scared, I thought no one could save me
You came along, scooped me up like a baby

Boy, get into my car, got a bad desire
You know that we'll never leave if we don't get out now, now, now
You're a careless con and you're a crazy liar, but baby
Nobody can compare to the way you get down, down, down
I tried so hard to act nice like a lady
You taught me that it was good to be crazy

Sometimes I lay in my bed, and I dream of being hand-fed
I made the jam, with my man, about the homies
But now I must remember all about my tenderoni's
You're lonely by your homey baby I know how you're feelin
You in the mood for some Sexual Healing (sexual healing!)
Walk in to the jump I spot you as the music's blarin
Starin, but not - carin, about, what you - wearin
You're full grown with a mind of your own
I make you moan as my bone turn brick like stone
Whether you're single we can mingle as you jingle
Swing low, with the black Mandingo

I give your man a pound, then I ask you what's your name
(What's your name baby?) Sign a autograph, then I step with my staff
To the hotel, hope everything goes swell
That's what you say as I sway on my way to my room
Crazy deep, don't sleep I keep the poom poom, jockin
Clockin, knockin out the box when, I perform
That's why the girlies they swarm to see Big Ill
Later on that night at the arena
I seen her, tryin to get backstage between the
Niggas I was with and the security, she didn't
Lookin from a distance I see her booty's hittin (oh yes babe)
Stagger to the barricade and bag her as I grab her
Thinkin to myself, ""Ayo, I got to have her""

100,Tremor Christ/Spin The Black Circle,"The Comet

He stood a moment on the steps of the bank, watching the human river that swirled down Broadway. Few noticed him. Few ever noticed him save in a way that stung. He was outside the world—""nothing!"" as he said bitterly. Bits of the words of the walkers came to him.

""The comet?""

""The comet——""

Everybody was talking of it. Even the president, as he entered, smiled patronizingly at him, and asked:

""Well, Jim, are you scared?""

""No,"" said the messenger shortly.

""I thought we'd journeyed through the comet's tail once,"" broke in the junior clerk affably.

""Oh, that was Halley's,"" said the president; ""this is a new comet, quite a stranger, they say—wonderful, wonderful! I saw it last night. Oh, by the way, Jim,"" turning again to the messenger, ""I want you to go down into the lower vaults today.""

The messenger followed the president silently. Of course, they wanted him to go down to the lower vaults. It was too dangerous for more valuable men. He smiled grimly and listened.

""Everything of value has been moved out since the water began to seep in,"" said the president; ""but we miss two volumes of old records. Suppose you nose around down there,—it isn't very pleasant, I suppose.""

""Not very,"" said the messenger, as he walked out.

""Well, Jim, the tail of the new comet hits us at noon this time,"" said the vault clerk, as he passed over the keys; but the messenger passed silently down the stairs. Down he went beneath Broadway, where the dim light filtered through the feet of hurrying men; down to the dark basement beneath; down into the blackness and silence beneath that lowest cavern. Here with his dark lantern he groped in the bowels of the earth, under the world.

He drew a long breath as he threw back the last great iron door and stepped into the fetid slime within. Here at last was peace, and he groped moodily forward. A great rat leaped past him and cobwebs crept across his face. He felt carefully around the room, shelf by shelf, on the muddied floor, and in crevice and corner. Nothing. Then he went back to the far end, where somehow the wall felt different. He sounded and pushed and pried. Nothing. He started away. Then something brought him back. He was sounding and working again when suddenly the whole black wall swung as on mighty hinges, and blackness yawned beyond. He peered in; it was evidently a secret vault—some hiding place of the old bank unknown in newer times. He entered hesitatingly. It was a long, narrow room with shelves, and at the far end, an old iron chest. On a high shelf lay the two missing volumes of records, and others. He put them carefully aside and stepped to the chest. It was old, strong, and rusty. He looked at the vast and old-fashioned lock and flashed his light on the hinges. They were deeply incrusted with rust. Looking about, he found a bit of iron and began to pry. The rust had eaten a hundred years, and it had gone deep. Slowly, wearily, the old lid lifted, and with a last, low groan lay bare its treasure—and he saw the dull sheen of gold!

""Boom!""

A low, grinding, reverberating crash struck upon his ear. He started up and looked about. All was black and still. He groped for his light and swung it about him. Then he knew! The great stone door had swung to. He forgot the gold and looked death squarely in the face. Then with a sigh he went methodically to work. The cold sweat stood on his forehead; but he searched, pounded, pushed, and worked until after what seemed endless hours his hand struck a cold bit of metal and the great door swung again harshly on its hinges, and then, striking against something soft and heavy, stopped. He had just room to squeeze through. There lay the body of the vault clerk, cold and stiff. He stared at it, and then felt sick and nauseated. The air seemed unaccountably foul, with a strong, peculiar odor. He stepped forward, clutched at the air, and fell fainting across the corpse.

He awoke with a sense of horror, leaped from the body, and groped up the stairs, calling to the guard. The watchman sat as if asleep, with the gate swinging free. With one glance at him the messenger hurried up to the sub-vault. In vain he called to the guards. His voice echoed and re-echoed weirdly. Up into the great basement he rushed. Here another guard lay prostrate on his face, cold and still. A fear arose in the messenger's heart. He dashed up to the cellar floor, up into the bank. The stillness of death lay everywhere and everywhere bowed, bent, and stretched the silent forms of men. The messenger paused and glanced about. He was not a man easily moved; but the sight was appalling! ""Robbery and murder,"" he whispered slowly to himself as he saw the twisted, oozing mouth of the president where he lay half-buried on his desk. Then a new thought seized him: If they found him here alone—with all this money and all these dead men—what would his life be worth? He glanced about, tiptoed cautiously to a side door, and again looked behind. Quietly he turned the latch and stepped out into Wall Street.

How silent the street was! Not a soul was stirring, and yet it was high-noon—Wall Street? Broadway? He glanced almost wildly up and down, then across the street, and as he looked, a sickening horror froze in his limbs. With a choking cry of utter fright he lunged, leaned giddily against the cold building, and stared helplessly at the sight.

In the great stone doorway a hundred men and women and children lay crushed and twisted and jammed, forced into that great, gaping doorway like refuse in a can—as if in one wild, frantic rush to safety, they had rushed and ground themselves to death. Slowly the messenger crept along the walls, wetting his parched mouth and trying to comprehend, stilling the tremor in his limbs and the rising terror in his heart. He met a business man, silk-hatted and frock-coated, who had crept, too, along that smooth wall and stood now stone dead with wonder written on his lips. The messenger turned his eyes hastily away and sought the curb. A woman leaned wearily against the signpost, her head bowed motionless on her lace and silken bosom. Before her stood a street car, silent, and within—but the messenger but glanced and hurried on. A grimy newsboy sat in the gutter with the ""last edition"" in his uplifted hand: ""Danger!"" screamed its black headlines. ""Warnings wired around the world. The Comet's tail sweeps past us at noon. Deadly gases expected. Close doors and windows. Seek the cellar."" The messenger read and staggered on. Far out from a window above, a girl lay with gasping face and sleevelets on her arms. On a store step sat a little, sweet-faced girl looking upward toward the skies, and in the carriage by her lay—but the messenger looked no longer. The cords gave way—the terror burst in his veins, and with one great, gasping cry he sprang desperately forward and ran,—ran as only the frightened run, shrieking and fighting the air until with one last wail of pain he sank on the grass of Madison Square and lay prone and still.

When he rose, he gave no glance at the still and silent forms on the benches, but, going to a fountain, bathed his face; then hiding himself in a corner away from the drama of death, he quietly gripped himself and thought the thing through: The comet had swept the earth and this was the end. Was everybody dead? He must search and see.

He knew that he must steady himself and keep calm, or he would go insane. First he must go to a restaurant. He walked up Fifth Avenue to a famous hostelry and entered its gorgeous, ghost-haunted halls. He beat back the nausea, and, seizing a tray from dead hands, hurried into the street and ate ravenously, hiding to keep out the sights.

""Yesterday, they would not have served me,"" he whispered, as he forced the food down.

Then he started up the street,—looking, peering, telephoning, ringing alarms; silent, silent all. Was nobody—nobody—he dared not think the thought and hurried on.

Suddenly he stopped still. He had forgotten. My God! How could he have forgotten? He must rush to the subway—then he almost laughed. No—a car; if he could find a Ford. He saw one. Gently he lifted off its burden, and took his place on the seat. He tested the throttle. There was gas. He glided off, shivering, and drove up the street. Everywhere stood, leaned, lounged, and lay the dead, in grim and awful silence. On he ran past an automobile, wrecked and overturned; past another, filled with a gay party whose smiles yet lingered on their death-struck lips; on past crowds and groups of cars, pausing by dead policemen; at 42nd Street he had to detour to Park Avenue to avoid the dead congestion. He came back on Fifth Avenue at 57th and flew past the Plaza and by the park with its hushed babies and silent throng, until as he was rushing past 72nd Street he heard a sharp cry, and saw a living form leaning wildly out an upper window. He gasped. The human voice sounded in his ears like the voice of God.

""Hello—hello—help, in God's name!"" wailed the woman. ""There's a dead girl in here and a man and—and see yonder dead men lying in the street and dead horses—for the love of God go and bring the officers——"" And the words trailed off into hysterical tears.

He wheeled the car in a sudden circle, running over the still body of a child and leaping on the curb. Then he rushed up the steps and tried the door and rang violently. There was a long pause, but at last the heavy door swung back. They stared a moment in silence. She had not noticed before that he was a Negro. He had not thought of her as white. She was a woman of perhaps twenty-five—rarely beautiful and richly gowned, with darkly-golden hair, and jewels. Yesterday, he thought with bitterness, she would scarcely have looked at him twice. He would have been dirt beneath her silken feet. She stared at him. Of all the sorts of men she had pictured as coming to her rescue she had not dreamed of one like him. Not that he was not human, but he dwelt in a world so far from hers, so infinitely far, that he seldom even entered her thought. Yet as she looked at him curiously he seemed quite commonplace and usual. He was a tall, dark workingman of the better class, with a sensitive face trained to stolidity and a poor man's clothes and hands. His face was soft and slow and his manner at once cold and nervous, like fires long banked, but not out.

So a moment each paused and gauged the other; then the thought of the dead world without rushed in and they started toward each other.

""What has happened?"" she cried. ""Tell me! Nothing stirs. All is silence! I see the dead strewn before my window as winnowed by the breath of God,—and see——"" She dragged him through great, silken hangings to where, beneath the sheen of mahogany and silver, a little French maid lay stretched in quiet, everlasting sleep, and near her a butler lay prone in his livery.

The tears streamed down the woman's cheeks and she clung to his arm until the perfume of her breath swept his face and he felt the tremors racing through her body.

""I had been shut up in my dark room developing pictures of the comet which I took last night; when I came out—I saw the dead!

""What has happened?"" she cried again.

He answered slowly:

""Something—comet or devil—swept across the earth this morning and—many are dead!""

""Many? Very many?""

""I have searched and I have seen no other living soul but you.""

She gasped and they stared at each other.

""My—father!"" she whispered.

""Where is he?""

""He started for the office.""

""Where is it?""

""In the Metropolitan Tower.""

""Leave a note for him here and come.""

Then he stopped.

""No,"" he said firmly—""first, we must go—to Harlem.""

""Harlem!"" she cried. Then she understood. She tapped her foot at first impatiently. She looked back and shuddered. Then she came resolutely down the steps.

""There's a swifter car in the garage in the court,"" she said.

""I don't know how to drive it,"" he said.

""I do,"" she answered.

In ten minutes they were flying to Harlem on the wind. The Stutz rose and raced like an airplane. They took the turn at 110th Street on two wheels and slipped with a shriek into 135th.

He was gone but a moment. Then he returned, and his face was gray. She did not look, but said:

""You have lost—somebody?""

""I have lost—everybody,"" he said, simply—""unless——""

He ran back and was gone several minutes—hours they seemed to her.

""Everybody,"" he said, and he walked slowly back with something film-like in his hand which he stuffed into his pocket.

""I'm afraid I was selfish,"" he said. But already the car was moving toward the park among the dark and lined dead of Harlem—the brown, still faces, the knotted hands, the homely garments, and the silence—the wild and haunting silence. Out of the park, and down Fifth Avenue they whirled. In and out among the dead they slipped and quivered, needing no sound of bell or horn, until the great, square Metropolitan Tower hove in sight. Gently he laid the dead elevator boy aside; the car shot upward. The door of the office stood open. On the threshold lay the stenographer, and, staring at her, sat the dead clerk. The inner office was empty, but a note lay on the desk, folded and addressed but unsent:

Dear Daughter:

I've gone for a hundred mile spin in Fred's new Mercedes. Shall not be back before dinner. I'll bring Fred with me.

J.B.H.

""Come,"" she cried nervously. ""We must search the city.""

Up and down, over and across, back again—on went that ghostly search. Everywhere was silence and death—death and silence! They hunted from Madison Square to Spuyten Duyvel; they rushed across the Williamsburg Bridge; they swept over Brooklyn; from the Battery and Morningside Heights they scanned the river. Silence, silence everywhere, and no human sign. Haggard and bedraggled they puffed a third time slowly down Broadway, under the broiling sun, and at last stopped. He sniffed the air. An odor—a smell—and with the shifting breeze a sickening stench filled their nostrils and brought its awful warning. The girl settled back helplessly in her seat.

""What can we do?"" she cried.

It was his turn now to take the lead, and he did it quickly.

""The long distance telephone—the telegraph and the cable—night rockets and then—flight!""

She looked at him now with strength and confidence. He did not look like men, as she had always pictured men; but he acted like one and she was content. In fifteen minutes they were at the central telephone exchange. As they came to the door he stepped quickly before her and pressed her gently back as he closed it. She heard him moving to and fro, and knew his burdens—the poor, little burdens he bore. When she entered, he was alone in the room. The grim switchboard flashed its metallic face in cryptic, sphinx-like immobility. She seated herself on a stool and donned the bright earpiece. She looked at the mouthpiece. She had never looked at one so closely before. It was wide and black, pimpled with usage; inert; dead; almost sarcastic in its unfeeling curves. It looked—she beat back the thought—but it looked,—it persisted in looking like—she turned her head and found herself alone. One moment she was terrified; then she thanked him silently for his delicacy and turned resolutely, with a quick intaking of breath.

""Hello!"" she called in low tones. She was calling to the world. The world must answer. Would the world answer? Was the world——

Silence!

She had spoken too low.

""Hello!"" she cried, full-voiced.

She listened. Silence! Her heart beat quickly. She cried in clear, distinct, loud tones: ""Hello—hello—hello!""

What was that whirring? Surely—no—was it the click of a receiver?

She bent close, she moved the pegs in the holes, and called and called, until her voice rose almost to a shriek, and her heart hammered. It was as if she had heard the last flicker of creation, and the evil was silence. Her voice dropped to a sob. She sat stupidly staring into the black and sarcastic mouthpiece, and the thought came again. Hope lay dead within her. Yes, the cable and the rockets remained; but the world—she could not frame the thought or say the word. It was too mighty—too terrible! She turned toward the door with a new fear in her heart. For the first time she seemed to realize that she was alone in the world with a stranger, with something more than a stranger,—with a man alien in blood and culture—unknown, perhaps unknowable. It was awful! She must escape—she must fly; he must not see her again. Who knew what awful thoughts—

She gathered her silken skirts deftly about her young, smooth limbs—listened, and glided into a sidehall. A moment she shrank back: the hall lay filled with dead women; then she leaped to the door and tore at it, with bleeding fingers, until it swung wide. She looked out. He was standing at the top of the alley,—silhouetted, tall and black, motionless. Was he looking at her or away? She did not know—she did not care. She simply leaped and ran—ran until she found herself alone amid the dead and the tall ramparts of towering buildings.

She stopped. She was alone. Alone! Alone on the streets—alone in the city—perhaps alone in the world! There crept in upon her the sense of deception—of creeping hands behind her back—of silent, moving things she could not see,—of voices hushed in fearsome conspiracy. She looked behind and sideways, started at strange sounds and heard still stranger, until every nerve within her stood sharp and quivering, stretched to scream at the barest touch. She whirled and flew back, whimpering like a child, until she found that narrow alley again and the dark, silent figure silhouetted at the top. She stopped and rested; then she walked silently toward him, looked at him timidly; but he said nothing as he handed her into the car. Her voice caught as she whispered:

""Not—that.""

And he answered slowly: ""No—not that!""

They climbed into the car. She bent forward on the wheel and sobbed, with great, dry, quivering sobs, as they flew toward the cable office on the east side, leaving the world of wealth and prosperity for the world of poverty and work. In the world behind them were death and silence, grave and grim, almost cynical, but always decent; here it was hideous. It clothed itself in every ghastly form of terror, struggle, hate, and suffering. It lay wreathed in crime and squalor, greed and lust. Only in its dread and awful silence was it like to death everywhere.

Yet as the two, flying and alone, looked upon the horror of the world, slowly, gradually, the sense of all-enveloping death deserted them. They seemed to move in a world silent and asleep,—not dead. They moved in quiet reverence, lest somehow they wake these sleeping forms who had, at last, found peace. They moved in some solemn, world-wide Friedhof, above which some mighty arm had waved its magic wand. All nature slept until—until, and quick with the same startling thought, they looked into each other's eyes—he, ashen, and she, crimson, with unspoken thought. To both, the vision of a mighty beauty—of vast, unspoken things, swelled in their souls; but they put it away.

Great, dark coils of wire came up from the earth and down from the sun and entered this low lair of witchery. The gathered lightnings of the world centered here, binding with beams of light the ends of the earth. The doors gaped on the gloom within. He paused on the threshold.

""Do you know the code?"" she asked.

""I know the call for help—we used it formerly at the bank.""

She hardly heard. She heard the lapping of the waters far below,—the dark and restless waters—the cold and luring waters, as they called. He stepped within. Slowly she walked to the wall, where the water called below, and stood and waited. Long she waited, and he did not come. Then with a start she saw him, too, standing beside the black waters. Slowly he removed his coat and stood there silently. She walked quickly to him and laid her hand on his arm. He did not start or look. The waters lapped on in luring, deadly rhythm. He pointed down to the waters, and said quietly:

""The world lies beneath the waters now—may I go?""

She looked into his stricken, tired face, and a great pity surged within her heart. She answered in a voice clear and calm, ""No.""

Upward they turned toward life again, and he seized the wheel. The world was darkening to twilight, and a great, gray pall was falling mercifully and gently on the sleeping dead. The ghastly glare of reality seemed replaced with the dream of some vast romance. The girl lay silently back, as the motor whizzed along, and looked half-consciously for the elf-queen to wave life into this dead world again. She forgot to wonder at the quickness with which he had learned to drive her car. It seemed natural. And then as they whirled and swung into Madison Square and at the door of the Metropolitan Tower she gave a low cry, and her eyes were great! Perhaps she had seen the elf-queen?

The man led her to the elevator of the tower and deftly they ascended. In her father's office they gathered rugs and chairs, and he wrote a note and laid it on the desk; then they ascended to the roof and he made her comfortable. For a while she rested and sank to dreamy somnolence, watching the worlds above and wondering. Below lay the dark shadows of the city and afar was the shining of the sea. She glanced at him timidly as he set food before her and took a shawl and wound her in it, touching her reverently, yet tenderly. She looked up at him with thankfulness in her eyes, eating what he served. He watched the city. She watched him. He seemed very human,—very near now.

""Have you had to work hard?"" she asked softly.

""Always,"" he said.

""I have always been idle,"" she said. ""I was rich.""

""I was poor,"" he almost echoed.

""The rich and the poor are met together,"" she began, and he finished:

""The Lord is the Maker of them all.""

""Yes,"" she said slowly; ""and how foolish our human distinctions seem—now,"" looking down to the great dead city stretched below, swimming in unlightened shadows.

""Yes—I was not—human, yesterday,"" he said.

She looked at him. ""And your people were not my people,"" she said; ""but today——"" She paused. He was a man,—no more; but he was in some larger sense a gentleman,—sensitive, kindly, chivalrous, everything save his hands and—his face. Yet yesterday——

""Death, the leveler!"" he muttered.

""And the revealer,"" she whispered gently, rising to her feet with great eyes. He turned away, and after fumbling a moment sent a rocket into the darkening air. It arose, shrieked, and flew up, a slim path of light, and scattering its stars abroad, dropped on the city below. She scarcely noticed it. A vision of the world had risen before her. Slowly the mighty prophecy of her destiny overwhelmed her. Above the dead past hovered the Angel of Annunciation. She was no mere woman. She was neither high nor low, white nor black, rich nor poor. She was primal woman; mighty mother of all men to come and Bride of Life. She looked upon the man beside her and forgot all else but his manhood, his strong, vigorous manhood—his sorrow and sacrifice. She saw him glorified. He was no longer a thing apart, a creature below, a strange outcast of another clime and blood, but her Brother Humanity incarnate, Son of God and great All-Father of the race to be.

He did not glimpse the glory in her eyes, but stood looking outward toward the sea and sending rocket after rocket into the unanswering darkness. Dark-purple clouds lay banked and billowed in the west. Behind them and all around, the heavens glowed in dim, weird radiance that suffused the darkening world and made almost a minor music. Suddenly, as though gathered back in some vast hand, the great cloud-curtain fell away. Low on the horizon lay a long, white star—mystic, wonderful! And from it fled upward to the pole, like some wan bridal veil, a pale, wide sheet of flame that lighted all the world and dimmed the stars.

In fascinated silence the man gazed at the heavens and dropped his rockets to the floor. Memories of memories stirred to life in the dead recesses of his mind. The shackles seemed to rattle and fall from his soul. Up from the crass and crushing and cringing of his caste leaped the lone majesty of kings long dead. He arose within the shadows, tall, straight, and stern, with power in his eyes and ghostly scepters hovering to his grasp. It was as though some mighty Pharaoh lived again, or curled Assyrian lord. He turned and looked upon the lady, and found her gazing straight at him.

Silently, immovably, they saw each other face to face—eye to eye. Their souls lay naked to the night. It was not lust; it was not love—it was some vaster, mightier thing that needed neither touch of body nor thrill of soul. It was a thought divine, splendid.

Slowly, noiselessly, they moved toward each other—the heavens above, the seas around, the city grim and dead below. He loomed from out the velvet shadows vast and dark. Pearl-white and slender, she shone beneath the stars. She stretched her jeweled hands abroad. He lifted up his mighty arms, and they cried each to the other, almost with one voice, ""The world is dead.""

""Long live the——""

""Honk! Honk!"" Hoarse and sharp the cry of a motor drifted clearly up from the silence below. They started backward with a cry and gazed upon each other with eyes that faltered and fell, with blood that boiled.

""Honk! Honk! Honk! Honk!"" came the mad cry again, and almost from their feet a rocket blazed into the air and scattered its stars upon them. She covered her eyes with her hands, and her shoulders heaved. He dropped and bowed, groped blindly on his knees about the floor. A blue flame spluttered lazily after an age, and she heard the scream of an answering rocket as it flew.

Then they stood still as death, looking to opposite ends of the earth.

""Clang—crash—clang!""

The roar and ring of swift elevators shooting upward from below made the great tower tremble. A murmur and babel of voices swept in upon the night. All over the once dead city the lights blinked, flickered, and flamed; and then with a sudden clanging of doors the entrance to the platform was filled with men, and one with white and flying hair rushed to the girl and lifted her to his breast. ""My daughter!"" he sobbed.

Behind him hurried a younger, comelier man, carefully clad in motor costume, who bent above the girl with passionate solicitude and gazed into her staring eyes until they narrowed and dropped and her face flushed deeper and deeper crimson.

""Julia,"" he whispered; ""my darling, I thought you were gone forever.""

She looked up at him with strange, searching eyes.

""Fred,"" she murmured, almost vaguely, ""is the world—gone?""

""Only New York,"" he answered; ""it is terrible—awful! You know,—but you, how did you escape—how have you endured this horror? Are you well? Unharmed?""

""Unharmed!"" she said.

""And this man here?"" he asked, encircling her drooping form with one arm and turning toward the Negro. Suddenly he stiffened and his hand flew to his hip. ""Why!"" he snarled. ""It's—a—nigger—Julia! Has he—has he dared——""

She lifted her head and looked at her late companion curiously and then dropped her eyes with a sigh.

""He has dared—all, to rescue me,"" she said quietly, ""and I—thank him—much."" But she did not look at him again. As the couple turned away, the father drew a roll of bills from his pockets.

""Here, my good fellow,"" he said, thrusting the money into the man's hands, ""take that,—what's your name?""

""Jim Davis,"" came the answer, hollow-voiced.

""Well, Jim, I thank you. I've always liked your people. If you ever want a job, call on me."" And they were gone.

The crowd poured up and out of the elevators, talking and whispering.

""Who was it?""

""Are they alive?""

""How many?""

""Two!""

""Who was saved?""

""A white girl and a nigger—there she goes.""

""A nigger? Where is he? Let's lynch the damned——""

""Shut up—he's all right-he saved her.""

""Saved hell! He had no business——""

""Here he comes.""

Into the glare of the electric lights the colored man moved slowly, with the eyes of those that walk and sleep.

""Well, what do you think of that?"" cried a bystander; ""of all New York, just a white girl and a nigger!""

The colored man heard nothing. He stood silently beneath the glare of the light, gazing at the money in his hand and shrinking as he gazed; slowly he put his other hand into his pocket and brought out a baby's filmy cap, and gazed again. A woman mounted to the platform and looked about, shading her eyes. She was brown, small, and toil-worn, and in one arm lay the corpse of a dark baby. The crowd parted and her eyes fell on the colored man; with a cry she tottered toward him.

""Jim!""

He whirled and, with a sob of joy, caught her in his arms.

A Hymn to the Peoples

O Truce of God!
And primal meeting of the Sons of Man,
Foreshadowing the union of the World!
From all the ends of earth we come!
Old Night, the elder sister of the Day,
Mother of Dawn in the golden East,
Meets in the misty twilight with her brood,
Pale and black, tawny, red and brown,
The mighty human rainbow of the world,
Spanning its wilderness of storm.

Softly in sympathy the sunlight falls,
Rare is the radiance of the moon;
And on the darkest midnight blaze the stars—
The far-flown shadows of whose brilliance
Drop like a dream on the dim shores of Time,
Forecasting Days that are to these
As day to night.

So sit we all as one.
So, gloomed in tall and stone-swathed groves,
The Buddha walks with Christ!
And Al-Koran and Bible both be holy!
Almighty Word!
In this Thine awful sanctuary,
First and flame-haunted City of the Widened World,
Assoil us, Lord of Lands and Seas!
We are but weak and wayward men,
Distraught alike with hatred and vainglory;

Prone to despise the Soul that breathes within—
High visioned hordes that lie and steal and kill,
Sinning the sin each separate heart disclaims,
Clambering upon our riven, writhing selves,
Besieging Heaven by trampling men to Hell!
We be blood-guilty! Lo, our hands be red!
Not one may blame the other in this sin!
But here—here in the white Silence of the Dawn,
Before the Womb of Time,
With bowed hearts all flame and shame,
We face the birth-pangs of a world:

We hear the stifled cry of Nations all but born—
The wail of women ravished of their stunted brood!
We see the nakedness of Toil, the poverty of Wealth,
We know the Anarchy of Empire, and doleful Death of Life!
And hearing, seeing, knowing all, we cry:

Save us, World-Spirit, from our lesser selves!
Grant us that war and hatred cease,
Reveal our souls in every race and hue!
Help us, O Human God, in this Thy Truce,
To make Humanity divine!",W.E.B. Du Bois,1994,"[100, 73, 54, 29, 18, 58]",6

Why you gotta mess with mine?
Don't keep sweating what I do
Cause I'm gonna be just fine - check it out

[Hook]
If I wanna take a guy home with me tonight
It's none of your business
And if she wanna be a freak and sell it on the weekend
It's none of your business
Now you shouldn't even get into who I'm giving skins to
It's none of your business
So don't try to change my mind, I'll tell you one more time

Now who do you think you are
Putting your cheap two cents in?
Don't you got nothing to do
Than worry about my friends? Check it...

[Verse 1]
I can't do nothing, girl, without somebody bugging
I used to think that it was me, but now I see it wasn't
They told me to change, they called me names, and so I popped one
Opinions are like assholes and everybody's got one
I never put my nose where I'm not supposed to
Believe me, if he's something that I want, I'm stepping closer
I'm not one for playing high-pole
Like the high soditty 90210 type of ho
I treat a man like he treats me
The difference between a hooker and a ho ain't nothing but a fee
So hold your tongue tightly, wish you could be like me
You're popping all that mess only to stress and to spite me
Now you can get with that or you can get with this
But I don't give a shit cause really it's none of your business

How many rules am I to break before you understand
That your double-standards don't mean shit to me?
I know exactly what you say when I turn and walk away
But that's OK cause I don't let it get it to me
Now every move I make somebody's clocking
Don't ask me nothing, will you just leave me alone?
Never mind who's the guy that I took home...to bone

[Verse 2: Pepa]
OK, Miss Thing never giving up skins
If you don't like him or his friends what about that Benz?
Your Pep-Pep's got an ill rep
With all that macaroni trap for rap you better step
Or better yet get your head checked
Cause I refuse to be played like a penny cent trick deck of cards
No, I ain't hard like the bitches on a boulevard
My face ain't scarred, and I don't dance in bars
You can call me a tramp if you want to
But I remember the punk who just humped and dumped you
Or you can front if you have to
But everybody gets horny just like you
So, yo, so, yo, ho - check it, double deck it on a record butt-naked
Pep's ass gets respected miss but its none of your business

If I wanna take a guy home with me tonight
It's none of your business
And if she wanna be a freak and sell it on the weekend

103,I'd Give Anything,"She looks at me and says that she can't help but feel depressed
But darling, looking at the life we've been given, how could you feel any less than grateful?
Sometimes it's hard to feel thankful for something when all it reminds you of are the times when you had nothing left to give
The times that ate you alive to the point where you questioned if you wanted to live
As she looked for all the bad that she could, it hid all of the good that reigned true
Looking only for the downsides and faults of everything, but with eyes only half open
Not seeing what she had been given, but only what she wanted
And when I told her that that life that we had created in our dreams could never be, she finally gave way and fell to her knees
The stones covering the ground sank into her bones, like the pain that those words carried as they dug into her back
Those words etched with the date in September, remained as a permanent reminder for what she lost
But after all was said and done, I was the one that walked away with the most pain
I was the one that walked away knowing that I had ruined any chance that I had at actually being happy
I thought this was what she wanted, I thought this was what I needed to finally make something of my empty, drawn-out life…
Maybe it’s because I find happiness in sorrow, or the fact that I've never let anything good blossom in my life
No matter the reasoning, the fact of the matter is... I'm alone again

Chasing away my pride and joy just so the pit in my stomach can grow an inch deeper every day
And with every single inch that it grows, and every single cigarette that touches my lips, I find it harder to make it through another day
That short buzz sure does the trick, but after packs a day you can watch yourself as you literally decay
I've seen myself fall apart more than I'd like to admit
Sometimes almost like a standby, watching everything that I once loved come crashing down and fall at my feet
But I think the worst part was... that I felt nothing
Not even sadness or guilt, or anything that reminded me of being human
I was numb to everything and everyone
I had lost the only part of me that could still feel
And yet I continued to push you away
Maybe I thought it'd bring peace or some kind of feeling back in my life
But when you chase out all of the light in your life, you also let the dark replace it…

I never thought that I'd see the day, as I watch myself destroy the better part of me
Cutting off what I lack hoping that it would bring some sort of clarity
Seeking what life would be like only half lived
But regardless of what I sought after, the fact of the matter is... I'm alone again",September Stories,1994,"[95, 93, 83, 81, 73, 70, 62, 60, 47, 44, 34, 29, 30, 28, 33, 29, 33, 36, 58, 81]",20
104,Can U Get Wit It,"[Verse 1: Usher]
Every time I look at you
There's so many things that I want to do
I promise you when I'm ready
That I'll spend my life with you
What is love, is it steady?
'Cause I don't know what to do
So tell me, girl, are you ready
To do what we came to do?

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
One day we could be together
Cause you know that I wanna be down, baby
But right now, we can all forget it
You know I gots to get around
I don't have much money (don't have no money)
I can't buy a diamond ring (can't buy a diamond thing)
I ain't trying to be funny (funny)
It's only a sexual thing (only a sexual thing)

[Chorus: Usher]
Can you get with it, it's like that
It's only a sexual thing
Can you get with it, it's like that
You ought to love the joy I bring
Can you get with it, it's like that
It's only a sexual thing
Can you get with it, it's like that
You ought to love the joy I bring

[Verse 2: Usher]
Please forgive me
'Cause I don't ever want to rush you
I might sound a little hasty
But let's do what we came to do
You know our time is really precious
And you wasted a lot of mine
I'm gonna have to keep on moving
If you can't make up your mind

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
One day we could be together
Cause you know that I wanna be down, baby
But right now, we can all forget it
You know I gots to get around
I don't have much money (don't have none)
I can't buy a diamond ring (and a diamond ring)

It's only a sexual thing
Can you get with it, it's like that

As the buffalo bitch go round the outside
Put a glide in your stride and a dip in your hip

Cuz nobody knows where the nose goes when the doors close

107,Do You Wanna Get Funky,"[Verse 1]
The lady smiled at me when she asked about the possibility
That we might spend some time alone
And, oh, the thoughts that filled my head
When she looked in my eyes and slowly said
Do you wanna get funky with me?
Do you wanna, whoa

The idle mind is a playground for the devil
Do you wanna get funky with me?
Do you wanna?

[Verse 2]
The way she spoke to me
Told me I had the opportunity
To see how funky she could be
And when I looked into her eyes
The fire they held made me realize
The flame was burning just for me
The lady tempted me
I closed my eyes, it was plain to see
She was the devil in disguise
And, oh, the message she'd relay
When she would take my hand and say
Do you wanna get funky with me?
Do you wanna?

I felt the heat within
The lust of love and the urge to sin
I felt her reaching for my soul
And then I knew I had no choice
But to heed the command of the devil's voice
Do you wanna get funky with me?
Do you wanna? Do you wanna?
Do you wanna?

Walked in the bank, put the loot in the cul-de-sac
Slapped on the guard four times for he passed out
Eyes on the blow and my pockets was assed out
Had on a trench coat, wig and some goggles
If'n you resist, you may not see tomorrow
I'm in there, outta there, the police couldn't get me
But I made a slip up; had a trick with me

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Don't turn around (Give me the fucking cheese trick)
Don't make a sound (Show me where the keys at)
Lay it on the ground (knowing that your pockets fat)
Fore' I buck you down (and I'm quick's to do that)

[Verse 2]
Nigga starting bragging in his hood about the robbery
Wasn't long then 'fore somebody dropped a dime on me
I'mma be the one they can't get to, they picked the boy up
Run his mouth just like a fool, he gone get me fucked up
But I'mma have to get to him before the police do-a
Caught up with him night and day, locked him and his crew up
Sprang down Chelsea Ave. kind of in the evening
For this motherfucker's death, dawg I was fiendin
He was looking at me strange, like I'mma catcher
I done hopped out with the thang, let me holler at'cha
Fool, where you been dog? (My momma got sick, man)
Fuck that got to do wit'chu? (Hold up I ain't your bitch, man)
I heard you been talking, your muthafucking lips loose (Nah, it ain't like
That dawg. I ain't no damn fool)
Looking in his eyes, I could see that he was so scared
I squeezed on the trigger with the gun to his forehead

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Blew the top out his skull, now they want me dead
All the niggas in his hood, police, and the feds
Stepped out of Westwood, way out of the side
On the other side of town, somewhere I can hide
I done threw my life away, hunted by them by pigs
Robbing every other day, drops in off my nigs
They done found my whereabouts, bouts' to do me in
Kicking in the front door, and I was in the den
SK was under the couch, snatched it off the wham
Open fire on them hoes, I didn't give a damn
Blood stream was full of dope, pump off coca leaf
Feds had me under a scope, and an infra-beam
Rifle bullet threw my throat, choking, hit the floor
Gunpowder in my mouth, knocking heaven's door

I done fucked myself off, cause of a bad mistake",Project Pat,1994,"[50, 47, 40, 33, 32, 27, 22, 15, 14, 11, 11, 12, 10, 10, 7, 8, 7, 6, 7, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 7, 12, 19, 40, 61]",31

Heartbreak drowned sorrows in a large steak

[Hook: Action Bronson]
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Because you treat me like shit
I paid for the bed and never even slept in it
I paid for that crib I never stepped foot in
And now somebody else is eating all the pudding
Things change, now my dashboard wooden
All black Benz, like a young Doc Gooden
Dark shades, cause I'm stone crazy
Girl, we grown, stop playing on my phone, baby
All your childish attempts to make me angry fall short
Which only fuels the rage you have, because you have nothing
Understandable, I'm shining brilliant with five Brazilians
There were times I used to hide my feelings
Now I'm butt naked in the Lamborghini
And motherfuckers can't see me
Wait 'til this chick see me on TV, I make the shit look easy
Who would've thought I hit you right back?

[Hook: Action Bronson]
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
So many women wanna call me baby
And you wonder why the fuck that I ain't call you lately
Some would say that I'm the symbol for sex and uh
Others would hate, but I don't give 'em no breath
Go on a date, I'm at the crib with the chef and uh, that's me
And you could order whatever
The specialty is white snake and underwear sauce
You could probably catch me somewhere where the sun is next
And I understand that's only cause I'm popular
I'm getting topped off in the front row of the opera
As Bocelli sings the celly rings
I gotta go, you'll never know how good it feels to lay in bed with king
I'm not exactly flawless, but I'm gorgeous, just like a horse is
I know the thought of me succeeding makes a lot of people nauseous
Still I'm on the back of the boat taking pictures with the swordfish

[Hook: Action Bronson]
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
I hope you get a paper cut on your tongue
From a razor in a paper cup
I hope every soda you drink already shaken up
I hope your dreams dry like raisins in the baking sun
I hope your titties all saggy in your early 20's
I hope there's always snow in your driveway
I hope you never get off Fridays
And you work at a Friday's that's always busy on Fridays
I hope you win the lottery and lose your ticket
I hope it's Ben and Socrates poop all up in your kitchen
I hope the zipper on your jacket get stuck
And your headphones short, and your charger don't work
And you spill shit on your shirt
I hope your tears don't hurt, and I can smile in your face
Cut my losses, how Delilah changed my locks to a fade
I hope you happy, I hope you happy
I hope you ruined this shit for a reason, I hope you happy (igh!)

117,"Stay (I Missed You) (From ""Reality Bites"")","[Opens in Cuddy’s office.]

CUDDY: Dr. Riley is throwing up; he obviously can’t lecture

HOUSE: You witnessed the spew, or you just have his word for it? I think I’m coming down with a little bit of the clap. I may have to go home for a few days.

CUDDY: [laughing] Dr. Riley doesn’t have a history of lying to me.

HOUSE: You said this is the fifth time he’s missed a class this year! Either he’s dying or he’s lying.

CUDDY: I’ll give you two hours off clinic duty.

HOUSE: Fine, I’ll have Cameron do it. She loves inspiring the inspired. *He starts to walk off*

CUDDY: You’ll do it.

HOUSE: [turning back] Why is it always me?

CUDDY: Because the world hates you. Or because it’s a class on diagnostics. Pick whatever reason feeds your narcissism better.

HOUSE: I’m not doing it. [He leaves, stops at the door, and walks back in.] You’re supposed to stop me. Renegotiate.

CUDDY: Hmm, and you were supposed to keep on walking. Sorry, I guess we both screwed up. Go on, do it again.

HOUSE: I’ll do the lecture for four hours off clinic.

CUDDY: Two. I know you’d rather spend a couple of hours listening to yourself than listening to patients. Class starts in twenty minutes. [House leaves into the lobby of the clinic.]

BRENDA: Dr. House, there’s a patient.

HOUSE: I’m outta here, take it up with Cuddy.

A voice: Gregg. [House turns at the clinic doors to see… the infamous Stacy, waiting with a bunch of papers and x-ray films. She walks up to him; House looks… well, it’s hard to describe. Run over by a bus sounds good.]

HOUSE: Hi, Stacy.

STACY: How’re you doing?

HOUSE: How am I doing? Well, the last five years have been like… you ever see those “Girls Gone Wild” videos?

STACY: Your life’s been like that, or your life’s been spent watching them? [They both kind of smile.] I have missed you.

HOUSE: Is that why you’re here? [Stacy shakes her head.]

STACY: I need your help. [She hands him the films; he limps over to the clinic desk to take a look.]

HOUSE: Who am I looking at?

STACY: My husband.

HOUSE: Who is suffering abdominal pain and fainting spells. No sign of tumors, no vasculitis. Could be indigestion, or maybe a kidney stone. A little one, can pack a lot of wallop.

STACY: Did you think I wasn’t going to get married?

HOUSE: Not to someone so poorly endowed. This guy’s pancreas is pathetic. [He walks off, Stacy follows.]

STACY: There is no kidney stone, no indigestion. Three hospitals, five doctors, not one of them found anything.

HOUSE: Well, maybe there’s nothing to be found.

STACY: Right, you suddenly trust doctors, love puppies and long walks in the rain.

HOUSE: The walks are out. [Stacy grabs his arm.]

STACY: I was around you long enough to know when something’s not right. Mark’s had personality changes, he’s acting strange, disconnected…

HOUSE: Interesting. It means there’s either a neurological component or he’s having an affair.

STACY: No affair, no nothing! He’s sick! I know you’re not too busy; you avoid work like the plague. Unless it actually is the plague. I’m asking you a favor.

HOUSE: I’m not too busy, but I’m not sure I want him to live. It’s good seeing you again. [He leaves, and Stacy is holding back tears.]

[Opening credits!]

[Cut to a lecture hall. House is sitting on the stage, not doing anything. There are maybe 20 people in the room, waiting for him to speak.]

HOUSE: Three guys walk into a clinic. Their legs hurt. What’s wrong with them? [A student – let’s call him Keen Student – raises his hand.] I’m not going to like you, am I?

KEEN: Most likely cause of leg pain is muscle strain. Apply heat and rest affected areas.

HOUSE: Statistically, you’re right. Very good. My experience: over half of leg pain is musculoskeletal, generally from excessive exercise. Twelve percent is varicose veins brought on by pregnancy, and most of the rest is the result of vehicular accidents. I said three people. That’s six legs. So, you’ve got three hurt jogging, two in collisions, and one of the legs is pregnant. [Some chuckles. Another student – let’s call her the Caring one – pipes up.]

CARING: What were they doing when pain presented?

HOUSE: I have no idea. [Enter the third student: the Rebellious one.]

REBELLIOUS: You didn’t ask? You didn’t take a history?

HOUSE: Of course, but all that told us was what they said happened. Person A, farmer, says he was fixing a fence. [Cut to a visual of the farmer.] Tightness of the ankle, loss of muscle control. [The farmer groans and collapses.] Person B, volleyball practice. [Cut to a girls’ volleyball team, where there is one middle-aged man playing with them. He dives for the ball and falls on the ground, clutching his leg.] Coach figured it was a pulled muscle. And C, [cut to a mini-golf course] we’ve got Carmen Electra. Golfing. [Her ball makes it into the golden Buddha, and she goes, “Yes!”]

KEEN: Whoa, you treated the Baywatch chick?

House: The Baywatch thespian. And no, I’ve gotta disguise the identity of each of the patients and I got tired of using the middle-aged man. Carmen seemed like a pleasant alternative. Also, she’s apparently quite the golfer. [He stands.] Now, in less than two hours, one of these three will get tossed out of the hospital because they were faking it to score narcotics, and one will be very close to death. Any guesses on which is which? [Silence.] Okay, I say we start with the farmer.

[Cut to a clinic room. The farmer is lying on the bed, looking very much… like a farmer. Straw in his mouth and everything. House is questioning him.]

HOUSE: Did you hike to the fence, and how far?

FARMER: Yes, it’s about half a mile from my farmhouse.

HOUSE: And where’s the pain localized?

FARMER: It started just above my ankle and it’s radiating up.

House: So, what should we do first? [He turns, and Keen Student is standing right next to him.]

KEEN: Family history?

House: Indicative of leg pain? That’s a very short list. Any history of bone cancer, osteogenesis imperfecta or multiple myeloma? [The farmer shakes his head. Caring Student pops up.]

CARING: Could be a blood issue. We should run a CBC and a D-dimer. [Enter Rebellious Student.]

REBELLIOUS: And get an MRI.

CARING: MRI or a PET scan?

REBELLIOUS: If the problem’s vascular, he’s better off –

HOUSE: Bzzt! Sorry, thanks for playing. Patient’s dead. You killed him. [The students look and sure enough, the farmer’s dead on the table.]

KEEN: We had no time to run any tests; there was nothing we could do!

HOUSE: You had time to look at the leg. [They look down, and the leg (and the overalls, and the whole farmer garb) is now the property of one Carmen Electra. She takes the straw out of her mouth and smiles.]

[Cut to the classroom.]

CARING: I thought we were starting with the farmer’s case first.

HOUSE: We are. But if we’re going to look at a leg…

[Cut to the clinic, again.]

HOUSE: I need you to take off your pants. [House stands in the corner with a smug look on his face as Carmen takes off the overalls. She gets back on the table, playing with her hair as she does so. House looks at the wound, and then looks out as he proclaims --] Puncture.

[Cut to the classroom]

CARING: Snakebite.

HOUSE: That would be my guess.

REBELLIOUS: Farmer didn’t know he had been bit by a snake?

HOUSE: That’s what he said. Sudden shooting pain, tall grass, never saw a thing.

KEEN: What kind of snake?

HOUSE: You want me to tell you what kind of snake it was from the shape of the hole in the leg?

KEEN: How are we supposed to know what kind of antivenin to use if we don’t know what kind of snake it is?

HOUSE: Oh, there are people to find those things out.

[Cut to Foreman and Chase, walking to the farm.]

CHASE: Shouldn’t we wait for the Humane Society or something?

Foreman: The guy might only have a couple of hours. [They open the gate, but close it again as a dog comes up barking at them.]

[Back to the classroom.]

HOUSE: And while we wait for the Humane Society to show up, what say we check up on the volleyball player?

[Cut to Cameron as she checks up on the volleyball man.]

CAMERON: You have tendonitis.

[Cut to the classroom.]

CARING: How old is this person? I mean, it’s not really a 40-year-old man on a girls’ volleyball team, right?

HOUSE: It’s a leg. A leg is a leg is a leg.

CARING: Well, I was just worried that –

HOUSE: Would you worry about her more if she was younger?

KEEN: Obviously we should care about our patients no matter what age –

HOUSE: Yeah, right. I saw the way you were looking at Carmen. She’s mine, stay away. [Chuckles from the class.] Would you operate on your mother?

CARING: Of course not. I’d be too nervous; couldn’t be objective.

HOUSE: Then why are you so anxious to treat every patient like they’re family? The actual patient is 16. Here’s what happens when doctors care to much.

[Cut to Cameron, talking to the now-16-year-old-female volleyball player.]

CAMERON: I need to know everything about you. [As the camera pans out, we see the player’s entire family is in the room with them.]

[Cut to Cameron talking to House in his office.]

CAMERON: I went back three generations: no history of cancer, Parkinson’s, or any other degenerative condition. But there’s this boy at school, and he’s on the boys’ volleyball team, and they made out at a party, and now he won’t call her back, and this friend of hers at school said this boy didn’t like her and never did.

HOUSE: You got all this from an examination of the knee?

CAMERON: I think she’s depressed.

HOUSE: She doesn’t have tendoni—

CAMERON: She has tendonitis.

HOUSE: She’s depressed about having tendonitis.

CAMERON: She’s depressed for the same reason she has tendonitis.

HOUSE: Not the boy.

CAMERON: No, the boy’s a jerk, she knows that, and yet she’s depressed. I found a nodule.

HOUSE: Ah. Problems with the thyroid gland causes depressed mental state, can cause inflammation of the tendons.

CAMERON: [nodding] I’ll run the tests.

[Cut to the classroom.]

CARING: So, because she took such an extreme interest, she found out the person had a thyroid condition.

HOUSE: No, because she took such an interest she discovered a tiny nodule. Which, in reality, signified nothing, but gave us no choice but to put a person with tendonitis through an expensive and painful test.

[Cut to the volleyball player getting a needle injected into her neck.]

[Cut to the classroom.]

HOUSE: Here’s how a well-adjusted doctor handles a case.

[Cut to House, examining Carmen the golfer, who has no pants on still. He hits her knee with a hammer.]

CARMEN: Can I put my pants back on now?

HOUSE: I’d rather you didn’t. [Caring Student shows up.]

CARING: Which Carmen Electra is this?

HOUSE: First one. The golfer. [Enter Keen Student.]

KEEN: Then why isn’t she wearing pants? [House gives him a look. Like, duh!]

HOUSE: [to Carmen] You have decreased reflexes in your patellar tendon. Anyone? [Rebellious Student has shown up.]

REBELLIOUS: Slipped disc?

HOUSE: Could be. How bad does it hurt?

CARMEN: [deadpan] It hurts really, really bad.

HOUSE: Yeah?

CARING: It doesn’t seem real. Is she the one faking?

HOUSE: Oh, for God’s sake. She’s here to play out my fantasy, not because she’s Meryl Streep. [Caring Student and Carmen both give him a look.] Fine. [Carmen disappears, and we see a man in his late 30s, now known as Late 30s Man.]

LATE 30s MAN: What the hell is wrong with me? [He’s rocking and clutching his right thigh.] Do something! [He collapses on the table in pain.]

CARING: Too much pain to be a slipped disc. Could be herniated and impinging the nerve root. [The students have to almost yell to be heard over the man’s groaning/yelling.]

KEEN: Or it could be referred pain from his groin.

HOUSE: Sir, are you getting pain anywhere else? [The last part is almost drowned out.]

KEEN: He’s curling; it’s not the back.

HOUSE: Sir, where are you getting pain?

LATE 30s MAN: Help me!

HOUSE: Oooh.

REBELLIOUS: He’s not going to tell us anything if we don’t get him out of pain. Give him 50mg of Demerol.

CARING: We have no history, he could be allergic.

HOUSE: [holding up the syringe] What do I do?

REBELLIOUS: We can’t diagnose him while he screams.

CARING: Better than killing him with pain killers, then – [While she is speaking, the man grabs the syringe from House and sticks it in his leg.]

HOUSE: Apparently, he’s not allergic.

LATE 30s MAN: Thank you, I feel a lot better now. [The syringe drops from his hand.]

[Cut to the classroom.]

CARING: We screwed up.

HOUSE: No, you did exactly what his attending did.

REBELLIOUS: And that was the proper way to handle the case?

HOUSE: Yeah.

REBELLIOUS: The guy used him as a dealer!

HOUSE: You’re going to see a lot of drug-seeking behavior in your practice, and there’s a reason: it works. Meanwhile, back on the farm…

[Cut to the farm, where the Humane Society has caught a snake.]

CHASE: [on his cell] Yeah, timber rattlesnake.

[Cut to the farmer’s hospital room.]

CAMERON: Four vials of the CroFab antivenin. Hey, how you doing?

FARMER: All right.

CAMERON: [taking the vial from the nurse] Thank you. This will start making you feel better really fast. [She starts to push the antivenin; 5 seconds after she starts the farmer starts to choke.] He’s having an allergic reaction, bag. [She starts to ventilate.] Paddles and epi.

NURSE: But his heart’s fine—

CAMERON: It’s not going to stay that way. [The monitors start to beep.] Paddles!

[Cut to the classroom, which has more people than when we last saw a full shot of it.]

HOUSE: What say we take five? Get some coffee, go pee. [He leaves.]

[Cut to the lounge area outside the classroom. House and Wilson are sitting there.]

WILSON: You didn’t think she was going to get married?

HOUSE: She asked me the same question.

WILSON: And… what? You’re not gonna treat him?

HOUSE: There’s probably nothing wrong with him.

Wilson: Oh, sure, that makes sense. She’s just using the old “sick husband” routine as an excuse to get back in touch with you. You think this is easy for her? The only reason she’d be anywhere near you was if she was desperate.

HOUSE: So I should help her because she hates me.

WILSON: She doesn’t hate you. She loves you, she just can’t stand to be around you. [The keen student shows up.]

KEEN: Uh, Dr. House? It’s been almost six minutes.

[Back to the classroom.]

KEEN: Found him.

HOUSE: The volleyball player was responding to the anti-inflammatories as you’d expect in a case of tendonitis.

REBELLIOUS: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What about the snakebite guy? I don’t really care about the volleyball player.

HOUSE: What if I told you the volleyball player had a sudden massive stroke?

REBELLIOUS: Really?

HOUSE: No. But that would make you interested, right? What if her T4 came back low? It’s not quite as interesting, but it has the benefit of being true.

REBELLIOUS: You said the thyroid biopsy was a wasted test.

HOUSE: No, I didn’t. I said she put a person with tendonitis through an expensive and painful test. Apparently the patient had tendonitis and a thyroid condition.

[Cut to Cameron talking to the volleyball player.]

CAMERON: We’re going to start you on Thyroxin. It’ll make you feel better and level your moods.

VOLLEYBALL PLAYER: Thank you. [She takes the pills.]

[Back to the classroom.]

REBELLIOUS: So, that’s it?

HOUSE: You were right the first time. Snakebite guy’s way more interesting. Gross, actually.

[Cut to the farmer, whose skin is starting to rot and peel off… yum! The farmer looks in a lot of pain.]

[Cut to House’s office.]

FOREMAN: The patient responded to epinephrine and the allergic reaction was arrested. Unfortunately, the patient continues to deteriorate.

CHASE: Maybe the snake wrangler was wrong about the type he caught.

FOREMAN: He faxed us the venom tests which confirmed it’s a timber rattlesnake.

HOUSE: [looking at the tests] No, it’s not. Notice the volume?

FOREMAN: I skimmed over that and the gender and the coloring and skipped right to the name of the snake.

HOUSE: 200mg. Our guy got bit less than four hours ago. There’s no way a snake regenerates that much venom that quickly.

[Back to class.]

KEEN: We’re supposed to know how fast snakes make their venom?

HOUSE: Nope. Unless you’ve got a patient bit by one. Then it might be helpful. So what do we do now?

CARING: He must have been bitten by a different snake. We go back and find it.

HOUSE: Or you go online and find there’s only three poisonous snakes common in New Jersey: the copperhead, the timber rattler, and the coral. The copperhead and the timber rattler both respond to the antivenins we gave the guy.

CARING: So we give him the antivenin for the other one.

HOUSE: Is that a question?

KEEN: Well, we can’t just blindly give him another antivenin. Especially after the first one almost killed him. You said only three types of poisonous snakes commonly found in New Jersey. But what if this is an uncommon one?

HOUSE: Very good.

KEEN: We’ve gotta find the right snake.

HOUSE: No need. Odds are, by the time you get back the autopsy results will tell you what kind of snake it was.

KEEN: But you said –

CARING: So we do give him the antivenin for the other one.

HOUSE: Again, was that a question? I asked what you would do. It seems unfair for you to ask me what you would do. Who gives the guy the other antivenin? [Half of the class raises their hands.] And who goes looking for the snake?

REBELLIOUS: I assume that one choice kills him and one saves him.

HOUSe: That’s usually the way it works at the leg turning black stage.

CARING: So half of us killed him and half of us saved his life.

HOUSE: Yeah.

KEEN: But we can’t be blamed for –

HOUSE: I’m sure this goes against everything you’ve been taught, but right and wrong do exist. Just because you don’t know what the right answer is – maybe there’s even no way you could know what the right answer is – doesn’t make your answer right or even okay. It’s much simpler than that. It’s just plain wrong.

[Cut to the farmer’s room, where the team is standing by the bed as Foreman is about to push the antivenin.]

HOUSE: [voiceovers] We gave the guy the antivenin.

FARMER: What if I’m allergic again?

FOREMAN: That’s why these people are here. If you have a reaction, we’re ready to do whatever’s necessary to ensure your airway stays open and your heart keeps beating.

FARMER: My wife’s on her way in, can’t this wait?

FOREMAN: I’m sorry, it can’t. [He begins to inject the serum, and nothing happens. House nods, and leaves the room to be confronted by the Late 30s Man.

LATE 30s MAN: It hurts again.

[Class.]

CARING: He came back?

HOUSE: [taking some Vicodin] On average, drug addicts are stupid.

REBELLIOUS: I’d call the cops.

HOUSE: Good for you. A lot of doctors wouldn’t risk their careers on a hunch.

REBELLIOUS: It’s not a hunch, I mean, I know he wants drugs.

HOUSE: I believe drug addicts get sick. Actually, for some reason they tend to get sick more often than non-drug addicts. Luckily, you don’t have to play your hunch, there’s a faster way. Actually, there are several. My preference is urine testing.

REBELLIOUS: But you already know he has drugs in his system.

HOUSE: That’s not what I’m testing for.

[Cut to a hospital room where Late 30s Man is lying. House enters with a nurse.]

HOUSE: We’re going to put this hard, rubber tube up your urethra and into your bladder. It might be a little uncomfortable.

LATE 30s MAN: Shouldn’t I be getting some kind of anesthetic? [He groans as the nurse does her job.]

HOUSE: We’re concerned about allergic reactions today.

[Classroom. House is looking through the drawers of the desk in the room.]

HOUSE: If the guy can handle a rod in his penis for half an hour, he’s really sick.

REBELLIOUS: Or he’s really jonesing.

HOUSE: There’s easier ways to get a hold of drugs. Other hospitals, for example. [He takes a mug out of the desk and sniffs it. He starts to walk off.] The volleyball player is not responding to treatment. [He leaves to go to the water fountain, and yells back -- ] At least we think it’s not working on account of the fact she’s getting worse. Can you still hear me?

REBELLIOUS: No.

CARING: A little.

KEEN: Not really!

HOUSE: [filling the mug] Well, if you can’t hear me, how do you know what I asked?

[Cut to Cameron, who is preparing to insert an IV into the volleyball player. She yells.]

CAMERON: I’m sorry. What did I do?

VOLLEYBALL PLAYER: I don’t know. It really hurts!

CAMERON: I promise to be very careful. [She gets ready to insert the needle, and the player flinches and yells as soon as the needle touches her skin.] Susan!

[At the water fountain --]

HOUSE: Not her real name!

[Back to the volleyball player.]

CAMERON: Susan, I barely touched you! [She tries again, and the player screams.]

VOLLEYBALL PLAYER: Aaaah! No, it hurts so much!

CAMERON: I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I have to get this blood. Just hold on.

[Cut to the Diagnostic office.]

CAMERON: Hypersensitivity to touch.

CHASE: Her calcium up?

CAMERON: Lab over 16.

HOUSE: The question is why. Likely suspects?

CHASE: Parathyroid adenoma.

CAMERON: Kidney problems.

FOREMAN: Vit. D intoxification.

CHASE: Hyperthyroid.

FOREMAN: Caused by our treatment?

[Back to the classroom.]

CARING: Whoa whoa whoa. Can you please slow down? [House takes a sip of water from the mug and spits it out.]

HOUSE: [slowly] The adenoma is most likely. Check her PTH –

[Back to Diagnostics, where he’s still speaking very slowly.]

HOUSE: -- phosphorus, and ionized calcium, and do a technetium sestamibi. Okay, that’s enough about the volleyball player. What’s up with the farmer? [They all look at him.]

FOREMAN: What farmer?

HOUSE: Snakebite guy. Oh, right, you guys don’t know about him. He doesn’t get bitten until three months after we treat the volleyball player. Luckily, it’s been well established that time is not a fixed construct. [He walks over to the white board, which now has writing on it pertaining to the farmer.] His condition’s not improving; double the dosage.

FOREMAN: Already did.

HOUSE: There’s another antivenin, it’s not as effective, but –

CHASE: Already tried it.

HOUSE: The first stuff, the stuff he was allergic to –

CAMERON: Gave it to him with high-dose steroids. Nothing’s working.

HOUSE: [to the camera] What does it all mean?

[Cut to the class.]

CARING: Wrong snake?

HOUSE: We tried every other antivenin we had.

CARING: We’re too late?

HOUSE: Yep. He’s dying. His wife’s here, finally found a babysitter. Who wants to let him know? Actually, I’m kidding.

CARING: He’s not dying?

HOUSE: Oh, yeah, he’s dying, but there’s no wife and kid. Which is great. Makes the “breaking the news” thing way easier. Oh, yeah, one more piece of news.

[Cut to late 30s man, we see that the catheter is circulating a red liquid (mmm hmm!)]

[Cut to the class.]

HOUSE: The drug addict is peeing blood.

[Cut to a later point with the class. House is fooling with yellow crayons, and drawing something.]

HOUSE: How do they teach you how to tell someone that they’re dying? It’s kind of like teaching architects how to explain why their building fell down. Do you roleplay and stuff?

KEEN: Yeah, one of us gives the bad news and one of us gets the bad news.

HOUSE: And what do you have to do to get an A in You’re Dying 101? They grade you on gentleness and supportiveness? Is there a scale for measuring compassion? This buddy of mine, I gotta give him ten bucks every time somebody says “Thank you.” Imagine that. This guy’s so good, people thank him for telling them that they’re dying. [He looks at his picture.] Eh, needs brown. I don’t get thanked that often.

[Cut to House with the farmer.]

HOUSE: You’re dying. In a few hours. There’s nothing we can do except deal with the pain.

FARMER: Well, I need to go home.

HOUSE: You’re not going home.

FARMER: Well, my dog? What will happen to my dog?

[Cut to radiology, where Cameron and Wilson are performing a PET scan on the volleyball player.]

CAMERON: Her neck looks clean. No adenoma.

[Cut to class.]

REBELLIOUS: Wait, wait, wait. The guy’s dying and all he cares about is his dog?

HOUSE: Any of you guys go the dog route in your improv sessions? It’s a basic truth of the human condition that everybody lies. The only variable is about what. The weird thing about telling someone they’re dying is it tends to focus their priorities. You find out what matters to them. What they’re willing to die for. What they’re willing to lie for.

[Back to the farmer.]

HOUSE: Well, you must have a neighbor who –

FARMER: The neighbors don’t like him.

HOUSE: Then the Humane Society can take him in and –

FARMER: No, they won’t. Maybe my aunt –

HOUSE: It wasn’t a snakebite, was it?

FARMER: I said I don’t remember being bit.

HOUSE: Sure you do. Just not by a snake. I assume that Cujo bit one of your neighbors awhile back. You tell me that he bit you, and I gotta report it. Cujo’s got a record, he gets the chair. The good news is, you might just live. The bad news is, your dog’s gonna die.

[Cut to Chase and Foreman, trying to wrangle with the dog using chairs.]

CHASe: The guy risked his life to save this thing?

FOREMAN: I’ll hold him, you swab the mouth.

CHASE: I think I’ve got a better grip here, you go for the mouth. [He holds out a fist.] All right, I’m odds.

FOREMAN: What, are you serious?

CHASE: Come on.

FOREMAN: One, two, three! [He puts out two fingers, while Chase puts out one.]

CHASE: I don’t care if he’s scratching your nads off, don’t let go.

FOREMAN: Just do it! [Chase tries to swab the dogs mouth, but pulls back.]

CHASE: I say we let the guy die.

FOREMAN: I got his head, just do it!

[Back in the classroom, House finishes his picture. He holds it up to the class to reveal… a brownish, orangish spot. Really ugly color.]

HOUSE: What would you call that? That’s tea-colored, right? The guy who we thought was just after the drugs… what’s the differential diagnosis for urine that’s tea-colored?

CARING: Kidney stone.

HOUSE: Kidney stones would cause what?

CARING: Blood in urine.

HOUSE: What color is your pee?

CARING: Yellow.

HOUSE: What color is your blood?

CARING: Red.

HOUSE: What colors did I use?

CARING: Red, yellow and brown.

HOUSE: And brown. What causes brown?

CARING: Wastes.

HOUSE: Which means the kidneys are shutting down. Why?

CARING: Trauma.

HOUSe: None that his history would indicate.

CARING: Could be damage done by the self-injection of the Demerol.

HOUSE: Treatment?

CARING: Heat and rest –

HOUSE: Other possible causes.

CARING: Infection.

HOUSE: Start him on antibiotics. What else? [She pauses.] Come on, come on!

CARING: I – I don’t know.

HOUSE: You’re useless. But at least you know it. Blood tests show elevated creatine kinase, what does that tell you?

REBELLIOUS: The trauma diagnosis is right. He takes it easy for a few days, he’ll be fine.

HOUSE: You sure?

REBELLIOUS: The elevated CK rules out infection –

HOUSE: You know what’s worse than useless? Useless and oblivious. [He goes to the Keen student.] What are they missing?

KEEN: You know, it’s kind of hard to think when you’re in our face like this –

HOUSE: Yeah? You think it’s going to be easier when you’ve got a real patient really dying? [to everyone] What are you missing?]

CAMERON: [from the doorway] Muscle death.

HOUSE: Not your case.

CAMERON: Nothing wrong with a consult.

CARING: Dying muscle leaks myoglobin. It’s toxic to the kidneys.

HOUSE: Brilliant. MRI his leg, see what’s killing it.

[Cut to the volleyball player going into the MRI machine.]

[Cut to the class.]

REBELLIOUS: Why is the girl getting the MRI?

HOUSE: Because the neck scan revealed nothing and her doctor’s way more obsessive than she thinks she is. [Cameron, sitting in the back, tries not to act like that was directed at her.]

REBELLIOUS: But you said the guy needed the MRI.

HOUSE: Because Dr. Cameron back there said muscle death, not one of you said it! Not one of this guy’s doctors said it. They gave him bed rest and antibiotics, just like you guys would have.

CARING: Did he get better?

HOUSE: No.

CARING: Well, how long –

HOUSE: Three days. It is in the nature of medicine that you are gonna screw up. You are gonna kill someone. If you can’t handle that reality, pick another profession. Or finish medical school and teach.

CARING: Three days before they thought it might have been muscle death?

HOUSE: No, three days before the patient suggested it might have been muscle death.

[Cut to the volleyball player’s room, where Cameron is talking to her and her parents.]

CAMERON: The MRI revealed an osteosarcoma: a cancerous tumor in your femur. It needs to be removed surgically. With chemo, she has an excellent chance of survival. But I have to warn you, depending on how large the tumor is, and how ingrained it is, the surgeon may need to amputate your leg. I’m sorry.

VOLLEYBALL PLAYER'S MOTHER: It’s okay.

[Cut to Foreman talking to the farmer.]

FOREMAN: Well, dogs’ mouths are pretty filthy, but they have natural antibodies to fight off most of the stuff. We don’t. That’s why dog bites can be so nasty. The lab test of your dog’s saliva revealed a type of strep bacteria. It’s commonly known as the “flesh eating disease”. We’ll need to operate immediately to remove the damaged tissue. We may need to remove the leg.

[Cut to Cuddy talking to the late 30s man.]

CUDDY: The MRI revealed a problem.

LATE 30s MAN: No kidding.

CUDDY: I’m sorry none of your doctors found it earlier; I’m personally going to oversee your treatment from now on.

LATE 30s MAN: You’re gonna cut me open, aren’t ya?

CUDDY: We may need to remove the leg.

[Cut to the classroom.]

HOUSE: His MRI showed that the leg pain wasn’t caused by the self-injection, wasn’t caused by an infection. It was an aneurysm that clotted, leading to an infarction.

FOREMAN: [sitting with Chase and Cameron in the back] God, you were right. It’s House.

[Cut to House, lying in a hospital bed. Stacy is sitting next to him.]

CUDDY: We have to do the surgery. The necrotic tissue has to be removed. If there’s too much –

HOUSE: I don’t care what you find.

CUDDY: It may become necessary in order to save your life.

HOUSE: I like my leg. I’ve had it for as long as I can remember.

STACY: Honey, I love your leg as much as you do.

HOUSE: They’re not cutting it off.

[Cut to the classroom.]

HOUSE: Patient made the right choice. Tell a surgeon it’s okay to cut a leg off and he’s going to spend the night polishing his good hacksaw.

REBELLIOUS: Right, surgeons could care less about saving limbs.

HOUSE: Well, of course they care about their patients. They just care about themselves more. Which is not an unreasonable position. Trying to maximize the tissue you save also maximizes the chances of something going wrong. Which means you’ve gotta be extra careful. Which is such a pain in the ass.

[Cut to Cuddy, House and Stacy.]

CUDDY: Amazing advances have been made. Kids with prosthetic legs are running the 100-meter dash in twelve seconds.

HOUSE: Yeah, they’re just not as pretty. Do a bypass, restore the circulation.

CUDDY: Amputation is safer.

HOUSE: For you, or me?

CUDDY: The blockage of blood flow –

HOUSE: Four-day blockage.

CUDDY: Yes. It caused muscle cell death. When those cells die, they release cytokines and potassium --

HOUSE: If you restore the blood flow instead of just lopping it all off, then all that crap gets washed back into my system. The cytokines could cause organ failure, the potassium could cause cardiac arrest. On the other hand, I may just get the use of my leg back.

CUDDY: The post-operative pain alone –

HOUSE: I’ll get through it. I understand the risks, you’re in the clear. Go schedule an OR. [Cuddy leaves.]

STACY: God, you’re an idiot.

HOUSe: I think I’m more of a jerk.

STACY: I’m not being glib. And I’m not being cute, I don’t want you to kill yourself.

HOUSE: I’m not gonna die.

STACY: Oh, I feel completely reassured.

[Cut to the volleyball player and her family, who are waiting (praying?).]

[Cut to House, who is writing “Not this leg” on his left leg. Stacy helps him to write “Not this leg either” on his right.]

[Cut to the volleyball player, in surgery.]

[Cut to the farmer, in surgery.]

[Cut to House, in surgery. CGI shot as they remove the clot from his leg.]

[Cut to House and Stacy in a hospital room. House is yelling in pain.]

HOUSE: I think they gotta up that morphine.

STACY: The doctors say they can’t.

HOUSE: The doctors recommended bed rest and antibiotics.

STACY: They screwed up, it doesn’t mean they’re wrong this time.

HOUSE: Sure doesn’t mean they’re right.

STACY: Morphine will kill you.

HOUSE: I can handle it.

STACY: You’re in pain, you’re not thinking right.

HOUSE: That’s why I need the damn morphine!

STACY: Okay, I’ll talk to them. [She leaves.]

[Cut to Stacy talking to Cuddy.]

STACY: Oh my God, how much longer is the pain going to last?

CUDDY: It depends on how much muscle cell death there was. He could be right, he could come out of this with almost full use of his leg.

STACY: Or?

CUDDY: He could be in pain for the rest of his life. There’s a third option, surgically. A middle ground between what we did and amputation.

STACY: He’s not big on middle ground.

CUDDY: Yeah.

[Cut to House, reading the printouts from the EKG machine.]

HOUSE: Nurse? Nurse! I need more calcium gluconate.

NURSE: You just had 5 mLs.

HOUSE: The QRS is getting wider. My potassium is rising.

NURSE: I’ll talk to your doctor.

HOUSE: Well, you better make it fast, ‘cause I’m about to go into cardiac arrest. You give me the dose, or I go into wide complex tachycardia.

NURSE: I could get in trouble –

HOUSE: Listen, it’s not a narcotic! I’m not looking for a buzz. You’ve got about twenty seconds. [His breathing quickens, and the monitors all go off.] I was wrong. [Nurses and doctors enter, including Cuddy.]

SOMEONE: What have you got?

NURSE: Wide complex tachycardia.

CUDDY: Who diagnosed –

NURSE: He did.

CUDDY: Paddles! Charge.

NURSE: Clear! [They shock him, and he flatlines.]

[Cut to the classroom.]

HOUSE: The patient was technically dead for over a minute.

[Cut to the farmer, walking with a new dog. He stops, and we see his prosthetic leg. House is watching him, standing there in a white hospital gown. The scene whites out and –]

[Cut to the volleyball game, where the volleyball player is playing a game. House is standing in the stands. The scene whites out as we hear the flatline monitor and Cuddy shocking him again.]

[Cut to the hospital room.]

CUDDY: He’s back.

[Cut to the classroom.]

WILSON: [standing in the back] Do you think he was dead? Do you think those experiences were real?

HOUSE: Define real. They were real experiences. What they meant… Personally, I choose to believe that the white light people sometimes see visions, this patient saw. They’re all just chemical reactions that take place when the brain shuts down.

FOREMAN: You choose to believe that?

HOUSE: There’s no conclusive science. My choice has no practical relevance to my life, I choose the outcome I find more comforting.

CAMERON: You find it more comforting to believe that this is it?

HOUSE: I find it more comforting to believe that this isn’t simply a test.

[Cut to House and Stacy.]

STACY: How bad is the pain right now?

HOUSE: It’s bad.

STACY: It’s not getting any better. If you were right, the pain would be subsiding. You’d be getting better.

HOUSE: It’s just taking longer.

STACY: No, it’s not. We’ve got to let him cut the leg off.

HOUSE: It’s my leg. It’s my life.

STACY: Would you give up your leg to save my life?

HOUSE: Of course I would.

STACY: Then why do you think your life is worth less than mine? If this were any other patient, what would you tell them to do?

HOUSE: I would say it’s their choice.

STACY: Wha – not a chance! You’d browbeat them until they made the choice you knew was right. You’d shove it in their face that it’s just a damn leg! You don’t think you deserve to live? You don’t think you deserve to be happy? Not let them cut off your leg? [They’re both near tears.]

HOUSE: I can’t, I can’t, I’m sorry.

STACY: The pain alone is going to kill you.

HOUSE: I know, I know. I need you to talk to the doctor.

[Cut to Stacy, sitting in a waiting area. Cuddy walks up and sits with her.]

CUDDY: He change his mind?

STACY: No. He’s asked to be put in a chemically induced coma so he can sleep through the worst part of the pain.

CUDDY: We can do that.

STACY: What happens after he’s in the coma?

CUDDY: We’ll obviously monitor his condition closely, and if he can get through the next forty-eight hours without another cardiac incident –

STACY: I meant, I’m his health-care proxy, I get to make medical decisions for him if he’s not able to.

CUDDY: You should talk to him about what he wants to do.

STACY: I know what he wants, but if he’s out it’s my call, right? [Cuddy nods.]

[Cut to House’s room. Cuddy’s inducing the coma.]

CUDDY: You’ll be out in less than a minute.

HOUSE: Thank you. [to Stacy] Hey.

STACY: Hey.

HOUSe: I’ll see you when I wake up. We’ll go golfing. I love you.

STACY: I love you, too. I’m sorry.

HOUSE: [going under] You’ve got nothing to be sorry about. [Stacy gets up and walks over to Cuddy.]

STACY: The middle ground you were talking about?

CUDDY: We go in, take out the dead muscle. There’s still some risk of reperfusion injury, but –

STACY: Give me the forms you need signed.

CUDDY: You’re saving his life.

STACY: He won’t see it that way.

[Cut to the classroom.]

HOUSE: Because of the extent of the muscle removed, utility of the patient’s leg was severely compromised. Because of the time delay in making the diagnosis, patient continues to experience chronic pain.

CARING: She had no right to do that.

REBELLIOUS: She had the proxy.

CARING: She knew he didn’t want the surgery.

REBELLIOUS: She saved his life!

KEEN: Well, we don’t know that. Maybe he would have been fine –

CARING: It doesn’t matter. It’s the patient’s call.

REBELLIOUS: The patient’s an idiot.

HOUSE: [half-laugh] They usually are. Do you have a buzzer or something. What time does this class end?

CUDDY: [at the doorway] Twenty minutes ago.

HOUSE: I’m not doing this again. [picking up the “World’s greatest dad” mug and walking toward Cuddy] And this guy is not the world’s greatest dad. Not even ranked. Who the hell lets their kids play with lead-based paint? That’s why he’s always sick. Find him some plastic cups and the class is all his again. [He leaves, leaving behind a full room of shellshocked students.]

[Cut to House, walking to his office. He’s calling someone on his cell.]

HOUSE: Stacy, it’s Gregg. I’ve got an opening for ten tomorrow morning. Make sure your husband isn’t late. [He hangs up, and enters his office.]

A car breaks inches from her pale, bruised legs--
The homeless girl falls anyway, is up suddenly, stumbles onto

I need to call someone.
2.
NURSE
You can do that after the doctor
gives approval.
She sits up violently -- pain shoves her back down--
GIRL
I need to make one call, please.
It’s urgent.
Nurse, patience waning...
NURSE
One. What’s the number?--
She pulls out her personal cellphone.
GIRL
407.620.9208
NURSE
Where’s that?
GIRL
Florida. But it’s not where he is.
Nurse dials... the girl suddenly grabs her wrist like a viper
striking prey--
GIRL (CONT’D)
You mis-dialed.
NURSE
What?
GIRL
I heard it. You dialed the wrong
number.
NURSE
(cautious)
My mistake... tell me again.
GIRL
407.620.9208
The Nurse, edgy now, maybe dealing with someone more unwell
than she imagined, dials again on speaker.
The girl watches her closely. Ring... Ring...
MAN (V.O.)
Hello?
3.
The girl’s face falls. She says nothing.
MAN (V.O.)
Hello?...
The nurse looks at the girl expectantly...
MAN (V.O.)
Stop calling here, dammit. Just,
loose this number, okay? You don’t
know what you are doing to my wife.
It’s cruel.
The young woman curls into a ball like she’s been kicked.
GIRL
(a whisper)
Hang up.
The nurse snaps her phone shut. High alert now.
NURSE
Do you have family in the area?
That wasn’t your family, was it? We
need to contact them--
GIRL
I don’t have any.
The nurse moves the plastic ID bracelet around the girl’s
wrist -- there are two. Beneath them a thick ribbon of scars
like handcuffs made of skin.
NURSE
(soft)
Were you hospitalized before this?
The ID’s rubbed off. What’s your
name?
The girl takes in her blank bracelet, smiles bitterly.
NURSE (CONT’D)
Come on, fair trade, huh? I gave
you the call.
The girl looks the Nurse in the eye, an acute gaze.
GIRL
(genuine)
Do I know you? Who are you?
NURSE
I’m Alice honey. What’s your name?
4.
The young woman leans back into the bed resigned, closes her
eyes.
GIRL
You can call me The OA.
The nurse sighs, pulls out a digital camera. The flash blows--
The OA springs from the bed--
tackles the nurse to the ground.
INT. CORRIDOR - PSYCH WARD - ST. LOUIS HOSPITAL - DAY
Fingers tap out a numeric code into a security system. Heavy
doors creak open electronically--
As fast as old age allows, NANCY and ABEL, Midwestern couple
in their 70s, move through doctors, patients, gurneys,
following--
HEAD NURSE
She’s in a very fractured mental
state, and she refuses to respond
to the name you gave--
NANCY
We’ve seen the picture--
ABEL
We know what our daughter looks
like.
HEAD NURSE
Of course, it’s just-- she suffers
from persistent hallucinations,
thought disorder. She has very
unusual scarring on her back. It’s--
I’ve been doing this job thirty
years and-- it’s horrifying to look
at honestly. Our professional
recommendation is that you commit
her to in-patient care so we can
help her recover mentally,
physically--
ABEL
Can we just see our daughter,
please?
They move into
5.
A PRIVATE ROOM
The OA, hospital pajamas, hair askew in a few wild braids,
left hand plasti-cuffed to the bed rail. She looks up at her
visitors:
At the sight of the OA’s direct gaze Nancy lets out a yelp.
Abel grabs the door frame.
A long stare down between the three of them. Then--
OA
(to the nurse)
Who are these people?
No one says anything.
Nancy steps forward. OA eyes her, wary, but doesn’t move.
Nancy sits beside her on the bed. She takes OA’s hand. OA
flinches, doesn’t pull away. Nancy puts the girl’s right palm
over her wrinkled face--
The OA shuts her eyes. Expertly feels the contours of Nancy’s
face with her fingertips.
For a moment everything stills...
Finally, The OA pulls her hand away. Opens her eyes.
OA (CONT’D)
Nancy.
Nancy floods, full of feeling. Wraps her daughter up.
NURSE
(to Abel, a whisper)
What... I don’t understand?
ABEL
That’s our daughter, Prairie. She’s
never seen us before...
Abel can’t take his eyes from OA, can’t move toward her
either.
ABEL (CONT’D)
When she disappeared seven years
ago... She was blind.
SMASH CUT TO:
6.
EXT. MICHIGAN BUTTERFLY P.O.V. - DUSK
Farms and suburbs in various shades of white. A ribbon of
black highway. A lone, white FORD driving against the
heavyset trucks.
INT/EXT. JOHNSON CAR - TWILIGHT
The middle seat is powerful -- you can see the road but also
the profiles of both passengers in the front: Nancy and Abel.
A sign that was elegant in the late eighties announces
CRESTWOOD ESTATES -- a subdivision of a box-store hamlet.
OA
This is it?
NANCY
It is. You’re home.
OA lowers the window, closes her eyes. Smells deeply the
early winter scent. When she opens her eyes again -- the
weathered pristine of a thirty year old suburban street.
OA
It looks how it felt.
More cars than houses. Cars parked tightly on the side of the
road, in the driveways, but the street is quiet -- no
walkers, no runners, no kids on bikes.
NANCY
Someone’s having a party I guess.
They round the corner into a cul-de-sac--
TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE gathered on the lawn of a modest clapboard
house. Local news trucks peak out from behind the crowd.
NANCY (CONT’D)
Oh dear God. How did they...
At the sweep of the car’s headlights the mob turns. Writhes
in excitement. Lights on the cameras of local reporters flood
the scene.
Well-wishers push people out of the driveway. The crowd
spills into the street engulfing the car.
Nancy, genuine panic--
NANCY (CONT’D)
What do we-- I should reverse--
7.
ABEL
Just-- Just drive, Nancy--
NANCY
Where?! They’re everywhere--
Abel, anger rising at his helplessness--
ABEL
(looking out the back)
You can’t reverse now!
OA
(sober)
Do you have the garage door opener?
NANCY
See, I told you to fix-- No. No
it’s broken.
They’re parked half-way in the driveway. People everywhere.
They sit for a moment. The crowd stands there. No one knows
what to do.
OA rummages in the back of the car -- a sun visor, spin
shoes. She grabs the pale blue hospital blanket, throws it
over her head and opens the car door--
Abel quick on her heels--
EXT. JOHNSON HOME - CRESTWOOD ESTATES - CONTINUOUS
A roar of noise. PRAIRIE! PRAIRIE!
OA, blanket concealing her entire body save the surgical
booties on her feet, makes her way through the din.
Abel and a trusted neighbor do their best to push back
against the reporters, onlookers, bloggers, gawkers--
REPORTER
Nancy! What’s it like having your
daughter back?!
Nancy, overwhelmed but moved by the attention--
NANCY
(paces behind Abel)
We... We never stopped looking.
It’s... it’s a miracle.
REPORTER
How did she get her sight back?
8.
We go under the blanket with the OA: She’s steady. Eyes on
putting one foot in front of the other up the salted drive.
MAKE SPACE FOR HER. PRAIRIE! PRAIRIE JOHNSON! MR. JOHNSON!
Under the blanket with--
OA
(softly to herself)
That is not your name. They are not
your parents.
Someone gives her blanket a fierce tug-- OA grips the fabric,
moves faster--
NEIGHBOR
Stop that! She’s been through
enough!
Under the blanket:
OA
(quiet)
A house is not a home. Home is
wherever Homer is.
OA’s POV: a kid at her feet, scampering alongside, trying to
get a peek. He laughs once he sees her and runs away.
Nancy under fire in the clutches of reporters. Neighbors
enjoying the spillover of limelight.
REPORTER
Have police reopened the case? Who
took you, Prairie?
NANCY
(voice rising)
Abel! Abel!
ABEL
Nancy-- come... Get over here!
NANCY
I can’t!
Under the blanket: Flash bulbs exploding against the fabric.
OA’s breath rising rapidly.
ABEL (O.S.)
I’m gonna get you inside and go
back for Mom.
Abel unlocks the front door and pushes her into
9.
FRONT HALL - JOHNSON HOME
The door slams behind her. She’s alone. A shrouded figure in
the near dark.
Under the blanket with the OA: She stares at the carpet.
Slips out of her surgical booties.
The OA rubs her feet against the shag carpeting... her soles
remember this feeling, these particular fibers.
Tears, soundless and practical as sweat drip down her face.
Fists pound at the door.
CUT TO:
INT. JOHNSON HOME - CRESTWOOD ESTATES - MICHIGAN - DAY
A drill extracts screws from their sockets. Abel pulls a door
off its hinges: a girl’s bedroom time capsuled in 2008.
MASTER BEDROOM
Nancy child proofs the internet settings on a desktop
computer. Locks a laptop and a cellphone in a bedside table.
KITCHEN
Nancy collects knives, drops them into a Tupperware of
objects: ice pick, meat thermometer, belts, shoelaces.
INT. BIG ROOM - JOHNSON HOME - CRESTWOOD ESTATES - NIGHT
A plastic knife struggles through the remains of overcooked
pork chop on a ceramic plate -- Abel refuses to admit defeat.
OA watches him from across the dinning table.
Week old bouquets and gift baskets line the surrounding
counter tops. Nancy handwrites thank you cards.
Her sister REGINA and brother-in-law RON who drove up from
Tampa to be “of use” close out the group. They are a tan,
childless couple. Regina reads a magazine intently. Finally--
REGINA
If I was in People magazine I would
want to know. Look, you’re an
inspiration, Prairie.
OA glances at the magazine. Drinks water.
10.
OA
That’s not my name.
REGINA
Sorry, OA.
(to the group)
But what I don’t get is how come
it’s just half a page and in the
back?...
Abel clears plates. Moves into the kitchen.
SOUND: microwave heating up
Regina hands People to Ron -- under the headline MICHIGAN
MIRACLE a yearbook photo of blind Prairie and an image from
the other night with the hospital blanket over her head.
RON
...Because she’s not cooperating.
That’s what happens when they don’t
have a good picture.
Everyone throws daggers at Ron.
OA absently rubs her chest as if to relieve pressure. She
closes her eyes.
NANCY
Honey. What do you want to do? We
can do anything you want.
OA
I want to use the internet.
NANCY
The doctor specifically said no
internet.
REGINA
Why?
NANCY
(mouthing)
It makes her mind race.
The doorbell rings. No one moves to get it.
REGINA
(under her breath)
Bet it’s another gift basket.
11.
NANCY
Is there something specific you’d
like to see. Maybe I can go online
with you.
OA, eyes still closed, but her face is changing. She sniffs
the air...
Her cheeks go scarlet. Eyes fly open -- wild.
She looks around the room as if someone else is there--
breath shallow, fast. Heart thumping so fast she puts her
hand over it to keep it from coming out of her chest.
NANCY (CONT’D)
(anxious)
Honey... Prairie, what...
Abel walks in, oblivious. Sets down a tray of coffees and
Costco cinnamon buns -- heat rising off their gooey icing...
OA instinctively shoves the tray away from her--
It flies off the table -- HOT coffee SCALDS Ron -- He jumps
up in surprise, YELPS.
OA looking at Abel, but through him, beyond him--
OA
(guttural, primal)
Don’t eat them. Don’t eat his
poison.
Everyone in shock.
OA (CONT’D)
SPIT IT OUT!
Abel backs away, blank faced.
Regina moves to clean up -- Ron? The floor? The smell?
Nancy puts her hands on OA tentatively, who bats them away--
Then sees her. Registers Nancy. OA covers her face with her
hands.
Pink with shame she moves away from all of them and into the
corner. Shrinks into herself pulling at her hair.
12.
EXT. CUL-DE-SAC - CRESTWOOD ESTATES - NIGHT
After midnight quiet in the deepest recesses of the
subdivision.
OA wears Abel’s raincoat with a sweatshirt over it and
sunglasses despite the dark. She walks beside a bundled up
Nancy who speaks softly...
NANCY
I know you didn’t want to talk
about it with the police. They were
brutes, I understand that. These
things take time. But I need to
know...
OA -- unreadable behind the dark lenses.
NANCY (CONT’D)
Did you ever try and call me?...
Because I lived by that phone. I
was terrified you’d call the one
time I went to the store. I never
left the house. When I had to get a
job Abel figured out how to forward
the house line to my cell. And I
kept it on me, and loud, all the
time. In case.
Nancy takes OA’s hand.
NANCY (CONT’D)
I just... I need to know. Did you
ever try?
OA shakes her head no.
Nancy breathes deep, relieved. She leans her head into OA’s
shoulder, embraces her.
An AIRPORT SHUTTLE VAN rounds the corner. A petite but square
jawed flight attendant in her 40s hops out.
NANCY (CONT’D)
Oh, that’s Jo. Let me handle this.
Nancy moves off to intercept the neighbor. We can just hear--
JO
Jesse told me. It’s-- It must be
really tough for her. Hardest part
of my tour in the Middle East was
coming home...
13.
OA wanders away, eyes fixed on... Skeleton frames of
unfinished homes peaking above the dark trees. Movement in
the eaves... Or the treetops themselves?...
She crosses the grass between two finished, well lived-in
homes for a closer look.
Under the halogen glow of street lamps an annex of houses
abandoned mid construction -- boom time bust. Wilderness
encroaching on their exposed interiors.
A BLACK ROTTWEILER MUTT chained to the street lamp rises at
the smell of the OA. Growls at her. Bares his white fangs.
OA takes a step back. Movement in the eaves. She looks up--
A male figure melts out of the darkness on the second floor --
he RUNS the length of the roof beam and lands a back flip
high up under the moonlight.
OA, moved by the sheer audacity and grace of the stunt.
Another figure appears on the second story holding out an
iPhone filming.
OA moves closer for a better look, removes her sunglasses --
two TEENAGE BOYS materialize. STEVE, 16, newly cut man’s body
but a child’s face, savage eyes. JESSE, 15, half-Iraqi,
points his iPhone camera down at--
OA who stares at them unapologetically.
NANCY (O.S.)
PRAIRIE!
Nancy, a little breathless--
NANCY (CONT’D)
I didn’t know where you’d gone.
Jesse zooms in on OA -- her upward gaze, the cryptic smile on
her face. Closer. Closer still --
The image FREEZES: OA’s eyes wide, the mind behind them
whirring.
SOUND: guttural moaning.
MATCH CUT TO:
14.
INT. STEVE’S ROOM, WINCHELL HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
The image of the OA frozen on a laptop screen, grainy and
surreal in this teenage boy’s Spartan bedroom.
STEVE and MING-JAYE, 17, have sex on his laundry hamper.
Steve buries his face in her hair. Jaye sits on his lap,
backwards. He’s rubbing her clit. She’s fondling her breasts.
The sex is shockingly adult.
Jaye cums loudly. She drops to her knees to suck Steve off.
After a moment, he pulls her head away gently--
STEVE
I don’t think I can cum again.
Jaye nods, kisses his inner thighs, up his chest...
STEVE (CONT’D)
So you like the video Jesse made?
JAYE
Yeah the stunts are cool. You got
skills.
Steve holds back a smile.
JAYE (CONT’D)
And that blind girl. Woah.
STEVE
She’s not blind anymore.
JAYE
Why’s she wearing sunglasses?
STEVE
Weirdo. Wants attention.
Jaye starts to dress.
STEVE (CONT’D)
You gotta watch out for people like
that.
(beat)
Hey, don’t go yet. It’s early.
Let’s watch some stuff in bed.
JAYE
(clasping her bra)
I like you. You have a really nice
body and you smell good.
15.
(MORE)
I told you though, I’m not looking
for anything.
STEVE
(covering)
I’m not either. This is fun, but
there is someone else I like. It’s
the same for you, isn’t it? Who do
you like?
JAYE
This guy in chorus, you wouldn’t
know him.
STEVE
Aren’t they all gay? Who?
JAYE
I’m not telling you. That’s what no
strings attached means. Means I
don’t tell you things. And you
don’t need to tell me things.
Steve stung by this. Jaye, dressed, shoulders her backpack--
JAYE (CONT’D)
How did the blind girl get her
sight back?
STEVE
Nobody knows.
Jaye nods, walks out his bedroom door.
Steve stands naked, statue still. Moves to the window,
outside: Jaye climbs into her pick-up truck.
Steve punches the wall with such force it craters around his
fist. A beat. The door BURSTS opens--
MR. WINCHELL
Why is there a hole in my wall?
MR. WINHCELL, late 40s, red hair, bit of a belly but the belt
straps that in, takes in his naked son. Steve is silent.
MR. WINCHELL (CONT’D)
Was there a girl just here? Son--
Steve doesn’t turn around.
STEVE
Yeah.
16.
JAYE (CONT'D)
MR. WINCHELL
That teacher called again. Doesn’t
sound like you’re keeping your
promises to me.
(beat)
Put on some clothes. There’s putty
in the garage. Fix it.
INT. OA’S BEDROOM - JOHNSON HOME - MORNING
OA under the quilt with a small video camera. She takes a
breath, wills herself to speak into the lens:
OA
This is my first message in a
bottle to you. I need the internet
to throw it to the open sea.
SOUND: padded footsteps...
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Nancy pokes her head into OA’s bedroom: OA out cold. Nancy
admires OA from the doorless doorway. From that distance the
sleeping beauty could be her teenage girl again.
Nancy disappears with a slight smile.
OA opens her eyes at the sound of engines turning over. She
watches Nancy’s Ford Fiesta back out of the driveway.
SOUND: generic pop music - Ke$ha or similar
INT. STAIRCASE - 2ND FLOOR - JOHNSON HOME - MOMENTS LATER
SKYLAR (O.S.)
As a five time gold medalist, I
need my workouts to be fierce...
OA peers between the stair railings: Regina and Ron, work out
clothes, in just-off-synchronicity do hop-squats in the
living room below.
Regina’s iPad propped up against the bookshelf projecting:
Sylar, a 6’, 130 lb WNBA guest star of Nike’s Personal
Trainer AP.
SKYLAR (CONT’D)
Engage your core, Regina. 10
seconds.
17.
REGINA
She’s talking to you too, Ron.
Regina and Ron jump back and forth across two stacks of couch
pillows doing “Lateral Box Hops” with Skylar.
OA tiptoes back up the stairs.
INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
An old BRAILLE keyboard. Fingers fly across it. Each PASSWORD
ATTEMPT followed by a maddening BEEP. OA remains determined.
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - LATER
OA holds a ROUTER, types the serial number into the WIFI
AUTHENTICATION on a laptop. No luck. She throws the router.
INT. OA BEDROOM - LATER
OA balances the videocamera on a stack of braille books on
the window sill. Red light on.
OA direct address into the lens, quiet, sincere:
OA
I don’t even know how this will
reach you... I didn’t leave you
behind, Homer. I would never. Not
even for freedom. I know he said I
did...
EXT. JOHNSON HOME - LATE AFTERNOON
A pair of legs slip through the high bathroom window -- OA
bends out like a contortionist, drops to the grass softly.
OA (V.O.)
...I know you won’t believe him.
But maybe on some nights, the
really hard ones that sneak up on
you in the middle of a good week,
maybe you will forget me for a
moment and think he’s telling you
the truth...
18.
EXT. CRESTWOOD ESTATES - LATER
OA, raincoat with a big sweater over it, old round
sunglasses, roams the neighborhood filming herself as she
talks into the lens.
OA
I’m coming for you, Homer. For all
of you. He’s sent me back to the
beginning. I have to start from
nothing. It will take time.
POV of OA’s CAMERA: ants, hundreds of them, following their
chemical trail toward...
OA traces their black ribbon with great interest, eventually
looks up at
UNFINISHED HOUSES - EDGE OF DEVELOPMENT
A Korean-American teenage boy walks rapidly toward the most
complete of the derelict homes. No windows, some walls. The
dark insides of the house swallow the boy.
OA follows...
INT. HALF-FINISHED HOME - CONTINUOUS
Sawdust and dry leaves underfoot. Lifeless wires dangle from
the ceiling amongst living vines. House as quiet as the
encroaching dusk.
OA passes what would have become a kitchen--
FRENCH (16), flop of dark hair, Lacrosse player’s body, bent
over a desk made of a door and two saw horses. He’s in the
glow of a laptop, headphones on, SAT books cracked.
OA lights up, moves over with intent--
OA
Hey--
French startles, pulls his headphones down--
FRENCH
Woah, Jesus. Fuck.
He takes in OA -- odd attire, intense demeanor.
OA
Do you have wifi?
19.
FRENCH
There’s no electricity here... so,
no.
OA
You live in the neighborhood, could
I-- could I get your password? Our
internet is down... it’s important.
Putting his headphones back on, returning to work--
FRENCH
Ask upstairs.
INT. 2ND FLOOR - UNFINISHED HOME - MOMENTS LATER
OA climbs the stairs. She passes a teenager, wallet in hand,
coming down. He does a brief double-take.
BUCK (O.S.)
I can’t skip meds week to week.
STEVE (O.S.)
Not my problem. I don’t control
supply. I got what I got when I got
it.
OA moves up the stairs and into the
MASTER BEDROOM
Three boys stand in the wall-less suite facing the dark
forest: Steve, Jesse, BUCK (14) -- the Korean-American boy,
and JAKE Steve’s black rottweiler mutt.
BUCK
(shaking his head)
Give me the Demerol anyway.
Steve and Buck exchange -- zip drive for a Ziploc of pills.
OA walks through the doorless doorway--
STEVE
What the fuck?
All three take her in -- the unapologetic stance, the wild
white hair, the VIDEO CAMERA. Jake growls -- low, deep.
Steve, moves fast for the camera. Jake at his heels, teeth
bared--
20.
STEVE (CONT’D)
Who the fuck said you could come
into this house?
OA pulls the camera out of his reach--
Jake BARKS loud, aggressive. OA flinches, steps back.
OA
It’s not on. I’m not recording.
Steve grabs the camera. They tug-of-war for a hot second. He
RIPS it out of her tight grasp.
STEVE
Like fuck it’s not.
He inspects the camera. It’s off. He does not return it.
OA
...You’re the gymnast.
STEVE
You see any balance beams here?
OA
Don’t be angry with me. We’re just
meeting.
STEVE
See, what you call a meeting, I
call an intrusion.
OA
I don’t care about what’s happening
here. I need internet. I’m a
prisoner in my house and people are
depending on me. Just-- give me the
password for your wifi, or for the
Brekovs’ next door. Please.
STEVE
What does this look like to you? A
fucking Starbucks? Not my problem,
Crazy. Get the fuck out.
Jake, sponging Steve’s anger, barks loudly--
OA
(shouting over Jake)
Give me a password and I will go.
21.
She’s no match for Steve in strength, but her odd instincts
put him on the back foot. He can’t anticipate her. He doesn’t
like it. Especially in front of his clients.
STEVE
I don’t owe you shit, bitch. Leave
or you’re dog food.
Jesse and Buck trade a look. He’s pissed.
OA deliberately looks at the ground, not unafraid, but
resolute anyway.
OA
Give me my camera back.
STEVE
This is my camera now. Tax for your
fucking interruption.
OA stands very still. She looks up at Steve, takes him in...
Suddenly she FLIES at him grabbing for the camera--
STEVE (CONT’D)
ATTACK!
A BLACK BLUR-- JAKE POUNCES OA-- KNOCKS her to the ground.
OA winded for a moment, stunned, but just a moment-- She
reflexively kicks at the dog. He GROWLS, sinks his teeth into
her leg--
OA SCREAMS at the shock of pain.
French appears, breathless, takes in the situation and fasttries
to yank Jake by the collar from the OA-- Jake REELS
back, BITES French’s hand HARD--
FRENCH
FUCK! CHRIST!
French drops back in pain, stunned. OA scrambles to stand in
the reprieve-- Jake TEARS her down to the ground again.
Buck makes to run for help--
STEVE
Don’t you fucking dare...
It stops Buck in his tracks.
The OA surrenders, goes limp. Jake settles his thrashing, jaw
still firmly clenched into her leg. Then--
22.
OA PUNCHES the dog in the eye -- a CLEAN HIT with surprising
force.
STEVE (CONT’D)
(panicked)
Don’t you fuck with my dog!
Jake MAD. But OA no longer tries to escape. OA WRESTLES THE
DOG.
JESSE
(laughing in fear)
Oh Fuck! Holy shit man!
Jesse pulls out his iPhone -- films.
It’s hard to tell what from what -- OA and the dog locked in
battle, a violent tumble of white hair and canine fangs,
limbs and claws -- all four boys slack jawed at the
brutality.
STEVE
Stop! Get off my dog! JAKE, HEEL!
Jake, unresponsive, lost in the fight. Steve tries to grab
his collar, misses--
JAKE bites deeply into OA’s shoulder -- SHE GROANS. Then--
BITES into the top of the dog’s neck like a mother
reprimanding an errant pup. Jake yelps. She cranes Jake’s
head to the right, whispers something into the velvet cup of
his ear. His body softens...
The OA stands -- torn raincoat, bra exposed, blood smeared
across her face, nasty gouge in her shoulder.
Jake plaintively licks the blood dribbling down her leg.
Steve, all of them, in a kind of awe and terror...
STEVE (CONT’D)
You crazy fuck.
But he doesn’t make a move. And the boys clock this.
OA limps forward, Jake limping at her heels.
One step.
Two.
Three.
23.
She’s face to face with Steve, who holds his ground.
Without breaking Steve’s gaze, OA closes her fingers around
the video camera in his hand... pulls... Steve lets go.
She limps away from him... The boys watch her...
Crazy or not, victim or runaway, that woman has been through
something wildly unknown to them.
Jake trots after the OA, following her out... Steve lunges
for his dog, holds him back.
The OA shrinks into the twilight.
EXT. JOHNSON HOME - CRESTWOOD ESTATES - LATER
OA stands along the side of the house looking up at the high,
small bathroom window. It’s very high and very small. Fuck.
She turns to see MRS. BREKOV (50s) standing at her living
room window taking in the strange sight of her. Mrs. Brekov
quickly closes her shades.
INT. LIVING ROOM - JOHNSON HOME - MOMENTS LATER
Nancy paces, Abel cradles his head in his hands, Regina and
Ron still in workout clothes and TWO COPS taking notes.
They turn to -- OA, a sweaty, blood stained mess. Shoulder
wound fresh and leaking. Regina gives an involuntary cry.
INT. MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT
OA naked on the edge of the bathtub, a bloody washcloth in
her lap. Nancy with a bottle of peroxide gently dabs OA’s
wounds with cotton balls.
NANCY
Dammit, Prairie. What are we
supposed to do then?
OA
Nothing. Don’t do anything.
NANCY
You won’t talk about this dog
attack. You won’t talk about where
you’ve been. You won’t take your
medicine. Your life has been
entrusted to us.
24.
(MORE)
You were not to leave the house
alone. You promised.
OA
I wasn’t alone... in spirit.
NANCY
Don’t play games with me, Prairie--
OA
That’s not my name.
NANCY
I’m-- I’m done. We can’t trust you.
OA
You can’t keep me a prisoner of
this house. I’m a grown woman. And
if I’m going to stay here to
recover I need access to the
internet--
NANCY
You know the doctor’s orders. And
the delusions are real... Who is
Homer?
OA stands, seething, moves away from Nancy--
OA
You watched my video.
(rage building)
That was not addressed to you. That
does not belong to you.
Abel knocks at the bathroom door, starts to open it--
ABEL (O.S.)
Hey-- no shouting--
NANCY
(shouting)
She doesn’t have any clothes on,
Abel. Just, just give us a second.
OA sits again. Breathes deep. Nancy sits too. Both spent.
NANCY (CONT’D)
When you were a little girl and
first learning to cane, you got too
confident too fast. You decided to
run while caning. You smacked into
the edge of a wall and split your
forehead open. You remember that?
25.
NANCY (CONT'D)
OA smiles a bit, nods.
NANCY (CONT’D)
I know you are not my flesh and
blood, but when that happened I
knew you were my daughter. Because
I felt it. I felt like I got hit by
the wall too. That’s how I feel
now.
Nancy’s head drops. Her shoulders start to shake.
NANCY (CONT’D)
I can’t do this. You’re a stranger
in this house. You’ve got
these...these...
She picks up OA’s wrists -- heavy scars encircle them like
bracelets. Whatever the origin, it’s not self-harming.
NANCY (CONT’D)
And you won’t let anyone in. I
think... it’s time to think about
an in-patient program. Abel and I
just aren’t equipped--
OA
Mom...
The temperature of the room shifts. They are both listening.
NANCY
Yeah.
OA
It’s not that I don’t want to tell
you. I want to tell you. It’s
just... you wouldn’t know what to
do.
Nancy takes this in.
OA (CONT’D)
Please don’t send me away right
now.
Nancy sits back on her heels. Then-- goes to the bathroom
drawer, removes a PHARMACY BAG and dumps out two pill
bottles. Shakes free a neon anti-psychotic ZYPREXA--
NANCY
Compromise.
26.
OA looks at the pill, then Nancy, sees no way out. Finally
she takes the pill and puts it in her mouth, swallows.
Nancy gives her a look. OA opens her mouth, lifts her tongue
for inspection.
NANCY (CONT’D)
Good girl.
INT. HALLWAY - LINCOLN HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
This isn’t high school as John Hughesian battlefield. This is
high school as industrial kennel. Teenagers who look more
like bloated, starved for nutrition children than glossy,
sharp eyed adults.
Steve walks against the flow of traffic, pushing past a group
of underclassmen that include fresh-faced Buck. They make eye
contact but neither betrays a flicker of recognition.
The hall empties out. Steve alone before the windowed door of
a rehearsal room. He looks in: a CHORUS of a 120 boys and
girls singing for a teacher who conducts dispassionately.
Steve stealthily opens the door a crack. He stands there
listening, unmoved.
MILES BREKOV (17), a reed of a boy with ink black hair, steps
forward for his solo.
Steve watches with a grudge in his heart. But Miles’ voice
soars high and wide and hits Steve like an ocean wave
swelling out of nowhere.
Steve lets tears slip from the gates of his eyes.
EXT. PARKING LOT - LINCOLN HIGH SCHOOL - LATER
Steve holds his pants up as he runs across the parking lot--
STEVE
Hey! Yo, bro. Stop!
He catches up with Miles who loads his bookbag into his
pieceofshit Honda.
STEVE (CONT’D)
(genuinely moved)
Dude, I heard you in there. Really
blown away man. What’s your name?
27.
MILES
Miles. I gotta run.
STEVE
Man what are you going to do with
that?
(breathless thinking of
the possibilities)
You could be... famous, dude.
MILES
I don’t really want to talk to you.
STEVE
What?
MILES
You made fun of one of my friends
for being gay. Now you hear me sing
and it’s all good? I’m not like--
your American Idol, okay? Not in a
mean way. But-- I gotta go.
STEVE
Okay. Relax man. No big deal.
Miles smiles sheepishly. Steve, disappointed, turns to go.
STEVE (CONT’D)
Miles?
Miles turns-- Steve SOCKS him in the throat. HARD. Miles
crumples like a flower wilting in high speed.
DREAMLIKE SPACE - NIGHT
Floating through thick fog we hear OA’s hypnotic voice.
OA (V.O.)
What if the hunter comes back? What
if this was just another test.
Another way of showing us who’s in
charge.
A face lit dramatically from below appears through the
clouds. It’s STEVE.
OA lowers the camera, jumps back. She’s in her--
28.
BATHROOM
Shower on full blast producing tufts of steam. Steve is at
the bathroom window. He raps on it with his forehead.
OA hesitates. He motions for her to hurry up, sweating
through his grip on the windowsill.
OA unlocks the latch. The window hurls open, Steve folds into
the room like an acrobat.
STEVE
What you up to, Crazy? Looks weird.
Steve pulls a box from his backpack, hands it to OA.
STEVE (CONT’D)
Mobile router. You can hook it up
to your laptop. Bam. Connected.
Paid for. Want me to set it up?
OA -- smiles, beside herself -- nods. Steve pushes into the
bedroom, unwrapping the cellophane off the router.
STEVE (CONT’D)
How come you don’t have a door?
OA shrugs. Steve kneels down at the desk. Feels the braille
keyboard with his fingertips -- nods in understanding.
STEVE (CONT’D)
So I was thinking. Have you seen
‘Strangers on a Train?’
OA shakes her head.
STEVE (CONT’D)
Basically it’s like if people don’t
know you’re connected then they
can’t figure out the crimes you do
for each other. Thought I’d help
you out and maybe you could help me
out?
OA
I don’t even have a door to my
room.
STEVE
Yeah, yeah I know. But you’re a
grown-up. You might not act like
it. But you are one.
Internet connected, Steve pulls up:
29.
YOUTUBE VIDEO
We follow the blinding glow of a military grade flashlight as
it burrows through a dark suburban house and finds the face
of a sleeping teenager. The teen is yanked from his bed in
his underwear -- he SCREAMS in terror. Two brutes in uniform
plasticuff him... The teen’s mother stands in the doorway in
a bathrobe. She does not intervene.
STEVE (V.O.)
That’s what they want to do to me.
Send me to Asheville. No one goes
there voluntarily.
EXT. WINCHELL HOUSE / CRESTWOOD ESTATES - DAY
OA and Steve ride BMX bikes out of the cul-de-sac and towards
the mouth of Crestwood. OA weaves a bit, stops suddenly--
STEVE
You backing down already?
OA
No, I just -- take these pills.
They give me vertigo... they give
me a lot of things.
Steve looks at her -- nods.
EXT. FOUR LANE HIGHWAY - LATER
Steve zips through traffic like he’s playing a video game. OA
on the pegs of his bike delighted by his high wire act.
Steve pulls into a tundra of box superstores.
INT. MARSHALL’S - LATER
Gleaners of deals hunched over racks of clothing in the
fluorescent light. Steve holds several garments over his
forearm -- carefully, like he doesn’t want to wrinkle them.
OA adds another blouse to his pile.
OA
Then what happened?
STEVE
Nothing. That’s it. She said she
liked this guy in chorus and then
didn’t come over the next day.
30.
OA
That’s okay. You don’t want to go
there until your invisible self is
more developed.
STEVE
What the fuck is that shit?
Religion is for pussies.
OA
I’m talking about your longings,
the desires you tell know one
about, your mission. No one comes
here without mission.
Steve rolls his eyes.
STEVE
I was just starting to think you
were okay, but you fucking blew it.
She places her hand on his biceps, testing the muscle
expertly like a coach examining an athlete.
OA
You spend a lot of time on the
visible you. It’s impressive. But
she probably thinks the invisible
you is missing.
STEVE
That’s fucking stupid. I have
desires. I work hard. I’m not gonna
learn Chinese tomorrow and be,
like, a CEO or some shit. But I
want stuff.
OA
Like what?
STEVE
You know, to be somebody. I have
ambitions. I’m gonna be a trainer
to celebrities. Have my own show,
my own line of equipment. Jessie
and I have a YouTube channel
already.
Not unkindly--
OA
The thing with the future is, no
one ever gets there.
31.
Blowing up--
STEVE
Who the fuck asked you, Crazy?
You’re a grown up who lives with
your parents and tried to kill
yourself... Twice.
INT. DRESSING ROOM - MARSHALLS - LATER
OA tries things on, tossing clothes around. Steve waits
patiently on the other side.
STEVE
Say Ming was worried about my
invisible side, which she’s not cuz
she just likes to fuck, but say she
was... How do I show her that I got
it?
OA tosses a blouse over.
Steve carefully drapes another blouse over the top of the
dressing room without looking through the gap in the door jam
but kind of wanting to look through the gap in the door jam.
STEVE (CONT’D)
Yo, be gentle with that shit, OA.
OA pauses at the use of her name.
She looks through the crack in the door, finds Steve’s
profile -- his gaze averted deliberately, politely away.
A small smile from her.
OA
I dunno. Work on it some. Try
closing your eyes more. The moment
I got my vision back I couldn’t see
anymore. You get caught up in other
people’s expressions, faces,
colors. To really hear anything at
all, you have to open your door by
closing your eyes. Everyone’s a
captive of sight. That’s why no one
could escape the Hunter but me.
Steve looks around the changing area. Nobody there... He
tries closing his eyes. He stands there, arms splayed out
like a human coat rack, eyes pinched shut.
32.
His face scrunches up in distaste. Steve mouths inaudibly:
BORING.
OA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Yeah, it’s boring. At first.
He turns to look at her in surprise--
Catches a sliver of her NAKED BACK through the door jam--
ALL THE COLOR DROPS FROM HIS FACE.
A pattern of RAISED SCARS so intricate, so unearthly that
were they not obviously painful in their inception her back
would be a work of art.
He nearly drops all the clothes. She turns at his silence...
Their eyes connect.
He looks away.
She pulls her blouse on.
OA opens the door: Khaki capri pants, imitation silk blouse,
Aztec sandals and a matching belt.
She looks remarkably the part of suburban trophy wife.
They take each other in a beat. She waits to see what he will
say about the scars. He knows it. Letting it lie--
STEVE
(impressed with her look)
You gotta do a grown up hairdo.
She nods. She’s impressed. Not asking about her back is like
swallowing a flaming question mark. It takes metal. She
doesn’t let on.
OA hands Steve all the tags from the clothes and a bag of
floating votive candles.
OA
I’ll tell you something, Steve.
Love hurts exactly as much as it’s
worth.
STEVE
Don’t talk crazy talk with
Broderick-Allen. Just, talk normal
talk. No, just, don’t talk at all.
Just listen like you give a shit.
Yeah?
33.
INT. HALLWAY - LINCOLN HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING
Clack clack clack.
We follow low square heeled sandals down the highly waxed
floor. French twist from behind. OA strides down the
corridor, this is NOT HER NORMAL GAIT.
INT. HALLWAY - LINCOLN HIGH SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER
OA taking deep breaths, hand over her chest as if to hold her
heart back, opens the door into--
MRS. BRODERICK-ALLEN’S CLASSROOM
Polygons and Pythagorean theorems cover the paint chipped
walls. BETTY BRODERICK-ALLEN, late 40s, soft bodied but eyes
like a boar -- intelligent, missing nothing -- stands from
behind the desk.
BRODERICK-ALLEN
I’m sorry, I have a meeting, can it
wait?
OA
(timidly)
I think I’m your meeting...
BRODERICK-ALLEN
(taken aback)
I was expecting Mr. Winchell. We’ve
been speaking.
OA
I’m Steve’s step-mom.
Broderick-Allen takes in this young, lithe blonde.
BRODERICK-ALLEN
(sliver of bitterness)
Oh... Of course.
CUT TO:
Mrs. Broderick-Allen and OA seated in two student desks
pulled to face one another.
BRODERICK-ALLEN (CONT’D)
I’m not calling this meeting to
blame you or your husband. I don’t
know why kids sour or when.
34.
(MORE)
I’m calling this meeting to tell
you your son, your husband’s son,
has become such a problem I’m
asking for his immediate expulsion
from this school.
A beat. OA thought all she had to do was listen.
OA
... Will you explain the problem?
BRODERICK-ALLEN
I think it should be obvious from
my probation letter, but if I must--
I’m here to teach the kids who want
to learn. The kids who desire to
better themselves--
OA almost interrupts on Steve’s behalf-- stops herself.
BRODERICK-ALLEN (CONT’D)
If a disruptive, violent, and
frankly terrible student causes me
some trouble -- that’s fine, I can
handle rude remarks. But when he
costs the hardworking students
their right to an education, that
is where I draw the line and say
“No more.” I think he has real
psychological issues--
OA, impulsively--
OA
It’s not really a measure of mental
health to be well-adjusted in a
society that is profoundly sick.
Broderick-Allen’s eyes narrow--
BRODERICK-ALLEN
That’s a clever bumper sticker, but
I’m dealing with the brass tacks
here.
OA
(genuine)
What was your first reason?
BRODERICK-ALLEN
I’m sorry?
OA
Why did you become a teacher?
35.
BRODERICK-ALLEN (CONT’D)
Broderick-Allen, caught off guard, this is not what she was
expecting from Mrs. Winchell.
BRODERICK-ALLEN
(defensive)
Because I’m good at it.
OA
You must be...
(looking at the Teacher of
the Year plaques)
...but you couldn’t have known that
when you started...
BRODERICK-ALLEN
Well of course not. But you start
something because you have an idea
you may be good at it.
OA
That sounds like a second or third
reason... reasons that came later
like pride or security. What was
the first reason?
What the fuck is this?
Broderick-Allen decides to politely indulge her (Mr. Winchell
must have fallen for his spin/yoga teacher)--
BRODERICK-ALLEN
I take students who know nothing
and when they leave me they know
something.
OA
What do they know about?
BRODERICK-ALLEN
(getting annoyed)
Algebra II.
OA
I don’t believe you started
teaching because of quadratic
equations.
Broderick-Allen, truly thrown now, actually thinking about
the question, then--
BRODERICK-ALLEN
This isn’t about me.
36.
OA
It is. It’s about you and Steve and
the play, cast of two, stage:
classroom, over many dimensions
through time.
BRODERICK-ALLEN
(suspicious now)
I don’t follow.
OA
You know why Steve can’t learn?
Broderick-Allen’s annoyance becoming anger--
BRODERICK-ALLEN
Yes, I know exactly why -- he
doesn’t want to or he can’t. Either
way, that’s why he has to be
removed from those who want to and
can--
OA
Steve can’t learn because you lost
track of your reason. You can’t
even remember it.
BRODERICK-ALLEN
Oh God, this is ridiculous.
Broderick-Allen tries to stand -- OA places her hand over
Broderick-Allen’s.
OA
I think I know what it is.
BRODERICK-ALLEN
I doubt that very much since we
just met and I don’t like you.
OA
You let go -- of something dear.
Broderick-Allen blanches, firm--
BRODERICK-ALLEN
Stop right there.
OA
Who did you lose?
BRODERICK-ALLEN
My patience if you don’t stop.
37.
OA, studying Broderick-Allen’s tells -- her pupils, the
corners of her mouth...
OA
Was it a parent? A child of your
own? A lover--
Broderick-Allen laughs.
OA (CONT’D)
No... It was your other half.
Broderick-Allen turns, sharply. OA’s hand grasps BroderickAllen’s
forearm--
OA (CONT’D)
Someone you loved very much.
(beat)
A sibling, a twin--
Broderick-Allen looks at her with wet eyes, suddenly fierce--
BRODERICK-ALLEN
You want to talk turkey? Your
sociopath of a son punched a kid in
the throat two days ago in the
parking lot after school. The
victim didn’t report it because he
feared reprisal. That boy, Miles
Brekov, is a soloist who was to
compete at Nationals next week. Now
he has a lacerated trachea and is
unable to sing. I don’t give a crap
where that violence comes from or
why -- I don’t want it in my
school.
The OA -- stunned, listening. Steve didn’t tell her this. She
sits still a moment.
Broderick-Allen purses her lips -- exactly.
OA
I think Steve is lost. But in order
to teach him you have to teach
yourself again. And you decided
somewhere along the way you were
done learning. It was too painful
to stay open.
Broderick-Allen wants to interrupt, wants to stop this, can’t
bring herself to do it.
38.
OA (CONT’D)
Steve’s sensitive enough to know
this dimension is crumbling. To
violence, to pettiness, to greed.
These kids don’t have anyone to
look up to, their parents are
throwing in the towel on reality
for fantasy. Steve lives in a state
without hope. He feels all the old
values are unfounded. There is no
future that isn’t pointless so why
not fuck it all to hell?
BRODERICK-ALLEN
We all face the same hopelessness,
Mrs. Winchell. It’s what we do with
it.
OA nods. Then--
OA
You’re right. You are absolutely
right. So I’m asking you -- what
are you going to do?
(beat)
If you want to do your job expel
the bully. Focus on the kid who
sings like an angel even though he
doesn’t need you. If you want to be
a teacher, teach Steve. He’s the
boy you can help become a man. He’s
the boy you lost. He’s your first
reason.
OA rises, walks to the door.
Off Mrs. Broderick-Allen’s face.
EXT. FOUR LANE HIGHWAY - LATER
OA rides Steve’s bike. She pedals fast, furiously. Then
stands on the pedals leaning into the wind. Tilts her head
back, lets the sunshine overwhelm her. She smiles.
INT. CLASSROOM - LINCOLN HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
A scuffle of students filing in, Steve amongst them. The
eerie quiet of pre-class texting.
Mrs. Broderick-Allen puts her own phone away. She turns and
catches Steve’s gaze... gives him a wink.
39.
Steve nods back, stoic. But when he turns away from her his
face betrays a quiet, innocent joy.
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - UNFINISHED HOUSE - DAY
Missy, 16, her threads are a cut above -- Abercrombie not
Marshalls. She pushes glossy dark bangs out of her eyes.
MISSY
You sold Adderall to Madison for
20.
Late sun floods the skeleton woods beyond the wall-less
suite. A propane tank gases a small heater. Jessie and Steve
warming beside it with--
STEVE
Yeah, economies of scale, Babes.
It’s like senior citizen and
student discounts -- so everyone
gets in to see Avatar. You pay top
dollar cuz you got top dollar.
Themz be the economics of it. I
didn’t come up with capitalism.
MISSY
Maybe I should just get Madison to
buy it.
STEVE
Madison just lost her student
discount, Babes.
Missy shakes her head, hands him 50.
SOUND: loud singing from the master bathroom
Buck walks in. He eyes Missy. Missy eyes the master bath in
the room beyond:
OA, ear buds in, just visible, singing along to the music.
She’s standing in the jacuzzi taping things onto the wall.
MISSY
(low voiced)
Who is that in there? Is that...
STEVE
Uh... My cousin from Phoenix.
(handing her Adderall)
Move along Babes, I got work to do.
Steve and Jessie admire Missy’s ass as she walks away.
40.
Buck tries to get a glimpse of the OA in the other room.
STEVE (CONT’D)
(to Buck)
Hey, leave Crazy alone. She’s doing
her thing in there.
BUCK
What’s she doing?
STEVE
I don’t know. She said she’s
“trying to organize her mind.”
Jessie shakes his head.
JESSE
Good luck with that. She’s schizo
man.
STEVE
(definitive)
No she’s not.
JESSE
You’re just saying that cuz if she
is, and she is, you totally took
advantage of her.
STEVE
(sharp)
You don’t know shit about her, man.
So shuthefuckup.
BUCK
I looked it up. Schizophrenics have
bad hygiene.
All three look through the unfinished wall into the master
bath: can just see OA’s wild white blonde hair, not recently
washed. Her attire has gotten more elaborate...
BUCK (CONT’D)
She’s not dirty but she’s not clean
either.
JESSE
She jumped off a bridge naked in
the middle of winter. That’s page
one crazy.
STEVE
Cobain killed himself.
41.
BUCK
And Robin Williams.
STEVE
And Jeremy’s little brother.
(beat)
He was 12.
They all absorb the implications of child suicide. No one
asks why? Steve gives Buck a package--
STEVE (CONT’D)
It’s 4-androstenediol. He didn’t
have 19. You know, I googled it.
You should probably be doing
injections. It’s safer.
BUCK
What, I’m gonna ask my dad to
inject me?
Steve shrugs. Packs up.
STEVE
Alright, clear out guys.
Buck and Jesse make their way home. Steve walks through the
doorless doorway into the
MASTER BATH
Woah.
OA stands in the empty jacuzzi tub. A sprawl of collaged
images and symbols on the WALL ABOVE: A Braille map of the
US, some states in the Midwest traced in red. A skeleton with
a DOCTOR’S head lamp. Several different models of a pale blue
pickup truck.
A laptop connected to Steve’s ROUTER fires out glossy images
from a PRINTER.
Steve tries to take it all in. He decides he can’t, it’s too
troubling. He pulls OA’s ear buds out--
STEVE
Yo. You should head home, it’s
late. You’ll get busted.
OA
I need help with something Saturday
night.
42.
Steve, helping her out of the tub--
OA (CONT’D)
Do you have four friends who are as
strong and flexible as you are?
STEVE
Well, no one as strong as me, but
yeah, I got people. Why? You need
help moving out?
OA
Yeah, eventually. But it would take
a lot of practice. It’s important
it’s five though. I need at least
five.
STEVE
Yeah, yeah, I hear you, Crazy.
OA
And it has to be this Saturday
because it will take a while and we
have to get started. Also everyone
has to leave the front doors to
their houses open--
STEVE
Well, no one’s doing that, Crazy.
That’s how you get your shit
stolen.
OA
You don’t have anything in those
houses worth taking or that you
couldn’t afford to lose.
OA, uncompromising, intense--
OA (CONT’D)
The doors have to be open, Steve.
Off Steve -- is he in deep with someone unwell or someone
dangerous?
INT. COSTCO - CONTINUOUS
The real economies of scale. Hundreds of everything reaching
two stories high: Cereals. Best-sellers. Sirloins.
Mrs. Broderick-Allen in the frozen goods section grabbing 5
Lean Cuisines. She rolls down the aisle passing... Desserts.
43.
She stops in longing. Summons determination from a new
feeling inside herself. Rolls past to the checkout, spots:
Mr. Winchell, looking worn after a long day, waiting in line.
MRS. BRODERICK-ALLEN
Mr. Winchell.
He stops, looks confused, summons the memory.
MR WINCHELL
Yes, yes, Mrs.--
MRS. BRODERICK-ALLEN
Broderick-Allen.
MR WINCHELL
Yes. Nice to see you...
MRS. BRODERICK-ALLEN
I wouldn’t have stopped you, I
don’t like talking to parents
unless it’s in the classroom, but I
wanted to tell you what a special
woman she is. Odd. But, an original
thinker. I think she’s going to
turn Steve’s life around. And I
want you to know -- I’m committed
to help.
Mr. Winchell, startled, blank, then--
MR WINCHELL
The Asian girl, his uh, girlfriend--
MRS. BRODERICK-ALLEN.
No, no. Your new wife!
WOMAN (O.S.)
His what?!
Mrs. Broderick-Allen turns -- a woman with short brown hair,
50s, eyebrows drawn in, holding economy sized toilet paper.
Mrs. Broderick-Allen turns back to Mr. Winchell, beams at himMRS.
BRODERICK-ALLEN.
The new Mrs. Winchell.
WOMAN
I’m Mrs. Winchell.
Mrs. Winchell gives Mr. Winchell a sharp look -- WTF.
44.
MRS. BRODERICK-ALLN
(struggling, refusing to
see)
I...A young woman came in-- Steve’s
step mom. She-- she was very
passionate. Almost white hair...
Mrs. Winchell flipping through PEOPLE, turns the magazine to
Broderick-Allen--
MRS. WINCHELL
Did she look something like this?
Broderick-Allen takes in the blanketed figure running up the
drive -- MICHIGAN MIRACLE -- the high school photo of Prairie
Johnson. Those eyes...
Off Mrs. Broderick-Allen’s face. Something important inside
her crumbles.
INT. OA BATHROOM - JOHNSON HOUSE - NIGHT
OA folds a white sheet of paper into a plane.
She leans out the open window, flings the paper plane across
the lawn... It hits the wall by Miles’ window, beneath it --
the carnage of 2 dozen plane crashes. OA sighs. Tries
again...
EXT. LAWN - CONTINUOUS
The white plane sails through the moonless night like a dart,
just misses the crook of a tree’s arm, and glides into
MILES’ BEDROOM
landing at Miles’ elbow. He doesn’t notice.
INT. OA BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
OA’s ecstacy at having made the landing fades when Miles
doesn’t look up.
SOUND: Doorbell ringing
OA moves from her room, through the open doorway, to the
45.
TOP OF THE STAIRS - CONTINUOUS
She peaks to the foyer below as Mrs. Johnson cracks open the
front door revealing Mr. Winchell, Mrs. Winchell, Buck and
Buck’s father.
MRS. WINCHELL
Nancy, I think we have a real
problem on our hands.
INT. MILES’ BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Miles looks up from his Algebra II, notices -- a paper
airplane on the window sill. He looks across the drainage
ditch at the glowing rectangle of the OA’s bedroom.
He turns the plane around, mystified. Unfolds it. A note in
scribbled, uneven handwriting. Miles reads it aloud to
understand it:
MILES
“I can heal your voice. Saturday at
the unfinished house at the edge of
the development. Don’t discuss.
Leave your front door open.”
INT. KITCHEN - JOHNSON HOME - MOMENTS LATER
MRS. WINCHELL (O.S.)
I don’t care how we stop it. The
children should not be exposed to
someone capable of identity
theft...
OA’s ear pressed up against the kitchen door leading into the
LIVING ROOM
Nancy, Abel, Buck and Buck’s father sit. Mr. and Mrs.
Winchell stand, fired up. The bouquets have wilted.
NANCY
You’re acting like she’s-- she’s
some sort of pariah. She’s a sick
young woman--
MR. WINCHELL
Not my problem.
46.
NANCY
And your son is a troubled young
man!
MR. WINCHELL
Yes but my son is 16!
Tempers flared, heavy breathing.
BUCK’S DAD
Nancy... Nancy we all think what
you and Abel have done for Prairie
is very brave. Adopting a handicap
child. Her kidnapping. But, you
know, there are certain realities.
I saw her on the back of Steve’s
bike the other day and-- it
seemed...sexual.
MRS. WINCHELL
(looking to her husband)
Oh my God?
Abel, really uncomfortable now. Nancy losing it--
NANCY
This is ridiculous.
BUCK
She’s just lonely. It’s not such a
big deal. She wanted to make
friends--
BUCK’S DAD
It is a big deal, Michelle.
Buck rolls his eyes at the use of his birth name -- if you
hadn’t noticed you might now that Buck is biologically
female.
BUCK’S DAD (CONT’D)
(to Abel)
You did say Abel that the doctors
in St. Louis recommended she be
committed--
MR. WINCHELL
This is exactly what I’m talking
about. Why was that information
withheld?
ABEL
It wasn’t withheld. It also isn’t
your business.
47.
MRS. WINCHELL
How did she get her sight back? Did
she pay for that by prostituting
herself on the streets? What is she
teaching our children? We have a
right to know -- what the hell
happened to her?
Nancy shakes her head defeated.
NANCY
(quietly)
We don’t know.
MR. WINCHELL
Well that doesn’t cut it.
ABEL
You can’t possibly imagine what
it’s like to lose a child on your
watch. There were times I wished
they would find a body so it would
just be over. If you think we’re
going to give up because you say
so, let me assure you that we have
reserves of strength. We will keep
our daughter indoors. We will keep
her away from the neighborhood
youth. But you watch yourselves.
You pray and hope that you never
have even one night of what we went
through for years. Go home and hold
your children. Thank them for being
healthy and alive. And if you want
to know what happened to our child,
close your eyes Mrs. Winchell and
imagine.
A pause.
MRS. WINCHELL
I have imagined. That’s what scares
me. Look, I’m doing the hard thing -
- I’m sending my son away to get
the help I can’t give him. Maybe
you need to think about doing the
hard thing too.

Off OA, taking it all in...

INT. BEDROOM - BRODERICK-ALLEN CONDO - NIGHT
Betty Broderick-Allen lays out her clothes for tomorrow while
cribbing a cordless phone between her shoulder and cheek.
BRODERICK-ALLEN.
Exactly. What am I supposed to do,
ID parents?
TV NEWS on mute: fires in the desert, hard to tell if it’s
America or the Middle East.
BRODERICK-ALLEN
That’s why real crazy is so scary.
It’s hard to read. It’s between the
lines... Oh--Okay. Thanks for call--
(but the phone is already
dead)
Mrs. Broderick-Allen looks around. What drama! She smiles...
but there’s nobody there. She shakes her head.
She climbs into bed with her oversized laptop, is about to
load a movie when she changes course-- pulls up GOOGLE
instead, types: OA
Overeaters Anonymous comes up. She frowns--
Tries again with: “THE OA” Boom: a YouTube video, 27 hits.
OA’s frozen face, that wild white-blonde hair. BroderickAllen
can’t help herself, clicks PLAY:
OA
I've lost someone. Maybe you have
lost someone too.
Abstract clouds of shower steam... The clouds part -- Steve’s
unmistakable eyes through the window.
Broderick-Allen flinches -- slams her laptop shut.
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
Steve follows the glow of his phone’s GPS through black pine.
At a low stone wall he pockets the phone and looks up at the
STATELY MANSION -- dark save bright security floods.
Behind Steve four BIG GUYS from the wrestling team appear.
They’re equipped with duffel bags and backpacks.
Steve leaps over the wall, guys follow. Steve walks casually
across the lawn, assessing the house’s possibilities...
49.
He leaps onto the west wall of the house itself, scaling it
without hesitation. Bare fingers jammed into stacked stone.
Sneakers finding footholds in nothing.
By the second story, the guys below start backing away,
nervous, but Steve keeps ascending. He climbs without fear or
arrogance...
He stops suddenly, stuck. Holding the whole weight of his
body in his right fingers and left toes. He sweats. The
balcony ledge two feet too far...
The guys below, breathless...can he even get down from there?
Fuck it. Steve leaps-- just catches the railing. Hulls
himself over.
The guys shake their heads. He’ll kill himself someday, just
not tonight.
Steve looks out from the balcony into the dark wood. Small
blue lights twinkle throughout the trees like electric fire
flies mid winter. Steve smiles. Disappears inside.
The guys breathe. Steve appears at the side door of the
house, thrusting it open--
STEVE
Welcome to my swan song, meatheads.
House rape.
The trees now pulsating with light as 200 HIGH SCHOOL KIDS
guided by the GPS LIGHT OF SMARTPHONES pour out from the
woods and cross the lawn from all over...
STEVE (CONT’D)
Welcome. Welcome--
The high school students climb the hill.
WRESTLER
How do you know no one’s coming
home tonight?
Steve whips out his phone: a FACEBOOK feed of MISSY DESANTOS
and her parents on vacation.
STEVE
The Desantos are in Barbados. They
wanted us to house sit.
WRESTLER
What about when they get home?
50.
STEVE
Hard to blame hundreds of people
from all over Michigan. What are
you gonna do, arrest people for
retweets? Beauty of a house rape is
it’s a gang bang.
But by now the hundreds of kids pouring out from the woods
are too much to be stopped by one conversation in the only
doorway and BAM -- THE HOUSE IS SWARMED.
INT. MISSY’S PARENTS’ MANSION - NIGHT
Steve wanders the rooms with a baseball bat striking out at
will -- glass shards fly from silver frames leaving glossy
family photos exposed.
French watches Steve in disgust. But the honor students and
varsity athletes swallow French back into their choice
circle. Buck and Jessie watch French as mortal outsiders.
JESSIE
Come on. Let’s try and pretend like
this shit is fun.
Buck follows Jessie as they zigzag through the crowd. This
isn’t a house party from a 90s movie, it’s social networks
manifested -- strangers from all over the county, no easy way
to actually connect. No invitation to lose yourself.
MASTER BEDROOM
Strangely empty. Steve has been here -- his glass wake
glistens on the carpet.
BUCK
How come you’re friends with him?
JESSE
He wasn’t always like this.
BUCK
What happened?
JESSE
Same thing that’s happening to all
of us. Steve just isn’t holding it
in.
Carpet SOAKING wet, light leaking out from the
51.
MASTER BATHROOM
Two girls writhe on the marble floor beside a flooding bath.
Soaked clothes cling to their newly blossomed bodies. They
finger one another in rapture. Another girl films, she points
the phone towards the boys -- Buck hypnotized by the girls.
Jesse focused on the jacuzzi tub overflowing with water... It
looks eerily like the one in the abandoned New Crestwood
Estate house. In fact, it might be the exact make and model--
JESSIE
You think we should go?
One of the two girls stares at Jesse why is he talking?
GIRL
Yeah you should go, fatty.
The boys are pushed out. The door slams shut behind them.
Locks. They stand in the empty bedroom.
JESSIE
You coming?
BUCK
Where?
Jesse gives Buck a look--
BUCK (CONT’D)
Our parents would literally lock us
up and throw away the keys. At
least my Dad would.
Jesse pulls out his phone. Cues up the OAs YOUTUBE VIDEO. It
plays. Hangs there between them...
OA’S YOUTUBE VIDEO:
OA (V.O.)
The thing with the unknown is you
cannot know it.
through a window Miles being scolded by Mrs. Brekov / Buck
skateboarding down a hill, crouched impossibly low to the
earth, sailing fast / week old snow airborne again from new
wind in the tallest trees / French running through a vacant
trash strewn lot -- proud, young, noble...
French watches. It stirs something in all of them to have
been filmed secretly, to see their ordinary lives become an
integral part of poetry...
52.
FRENCH
I can’t. We could get into actual
trouble.
JESSE
Yeah. Just thought you would want
to know... Could make a great
college essay...
The video still playing--
OA
I can’t change your fate. But I can
help you rise to meet it.
(beat)
The house at the edge of the wood.
Midnight. Don’t bother coming
without leaving your front door
open. You have to invite me in.
FRENCH
Weird. Weird as fuck.
Beat.
BUCK
We could go through the woods. No
one would know.
I/E. JAYE’S PICK-UP TRUCK -- LATER
Steve and Jaye listen to XM radio as they drive.
JAYE
I guess this will be our last time.
Steve turns to look at her.
STEVE
Why didn’t you want to be my
girlfriend?
JAYE
I don’t want to be anyone’s
girlfriend.
STEVE
Come on, I’m leaving anyway. Just
tell me the truth. You said you
like how I smell.
53.
JAYE
I just want to get good at sex is
all. It’s just been practice. One
day I will fall in love and when
that happens I want to be ready.
STEVE
That’s fucked up.
JAYE
No it’s not. You’re an asshole.
Steve, suddenly flattens himself against the passenger
window, stares out: The front door of Jesse’s house is wide
open. So is the front door of Buck’s...
JAYE (CONT’D)
I can spend the night tonight? If
you don’t want to be alone.
Steve looks out the rear window at another house -- Door
open. Fuck. Did they go?
Jaye pulls up to Steve’s house. Unbuckles her seat belt.
STEVE
You’re right. I am an asshole.
He’s already out of the car. Jogging down the street. Jaye
watches him go, confused, yells out the window--
JAYE
What are you doing?
Steve changes his mind, heads back towards her, but doesn’t
stop. Over his shoulder sprinting up his lawn--
STEVE
BYE!
--to his house, to his front door. He puts the key into the
lock. Kicks the door open. What the fuck is he doing? Fuck
it. It’s the last night he’s spending here.
INT. UNFINISHED HOME - CRESTWOOD ESTATES - NIGHT
Jesse, Buck, French, Steve and The OA sit around the bathtub.
Floating votive candles flicker on the water.
STEVE
Okay we’re here. What did you need
help with so bad and in the middle
of the night?
54.
OA
I wanted you to listen to my story.
FRENCH
Like, what happened to you?
OA nods.
OA
But I need five. I told you that.
STEVE
We are five.
OA
Not including me. I invited the boy
you punched, but--
STEVE
Good thing he didn’t show. Just
include yourself and start already.
OA
It won’t work ultimately. I need
five from the beginning. For what
we have to do. Because it will be
dangerous, even with five--
French stands to leave. Why did he agree to this?
Steve boils. His sadness bubbling up now like sewer water--
STEVE
I’m tired of all this shit, OA. I’m-
I’m tired. I just left my own
fucking party for this shit--
SOUND: A LOUD CREAK FROM DOWNSTAIRS
Everyone freezes.
SOUND: FOOTSTEPS
French ducks behind the sink -- the only refuge in this room.
The rest stare motionless towards the top of the stairs... An
industrial flashlight beam breaks into the darkness.
THUD, THUD, THUD of someone climbing the stair... labored
breath... They are all stock still... Then, in the doorless
doorway.
MRS. BRODERICK-ALLEN shinning her flashlight RIGHT AT THEM.
55.
The kids instinctively back up -- stunned -- bracing
themselves for impact.
No one says a word.
Finally--
MRS. BRODERICK-ALLEN
I left my door open.
CUT TO:
The candle glow creates a strange shifting halo around OA.
Mrs. Broderick-Allen’s arms are folded over her chest.
Everyone sits on the floor cross legged. French leans back on
his elbows, feet crossed at the ankles.
OA
I was born in Russia in 1987.
STEVE
(laughing)
What?! Come on.
OA
My father was a very wealthy man.
He ran a mining company. He took
precious metals out of the ground.
Jessie and French trade a look. Jessie shrugs whatever.
OA (CONT’D)
We were always being watched.
Because he had so much money by
then. And in Russia if you have
money you pay some of it to the VoiSTEVE
Like the mob?
BUCK
Don’t interrupt. She’s gonna say--
OA
No questions. Just listening. Which
is different from hearing. Just
listen.

We lived in a secret city outside
Moscow with many of the other
recent rich...

EXT. SECRET CITY - 20 MILES OUTSIDE MOSCOW - DAY
Vast woods yield to green fences, 20 feet high and topped
with closed circuit cameras. Beyond them an extremist Beverly
Hills -- Georgian, Bavarian, Victorian mansions -- all
clustered together in hidden sanctuary.
OA (V.O.)
The man who does aluminum. The man
who does gold. The man who does
cable. There were many big houses
behind big gates.
We fly through the gates of one compound and up to an Art
Deco estate home.
INT. BEDROOM, ART DECO ESTATE - CONTINUOUS
A pale blonde girl, maybe 6, paints at an ornate wooden desk
in her bedroom.
She pauses, looks out the window, eyes deep navy and
familiar.
Outside: pine boughs droop under the silent snow.
OA (V.O.)
I suffered from things then. It
began when I was five. Images would
come on as strong as a dream but
while I was awake--
INT. MASTER BATH - EDGE OF DEVELOPMENT
STEVE
I fucking hate people telling me
their dreams--
MRS. BRODERICK-ALLEN
Just listen for christsake.

Images so real they had smells in
them and sounds sharper than life.
INT. BEDROOM - ART DECO ESTATE - CONTINUOUS
The little girls eyes loose focus, as if in a trace.
57.
Bright blood runs from her nose. Spatters on her blue
watercolor.
OA (V.O.)
In one of the images I am trapped
inside an aquarium...
INT. AQUARIUM - VISION - DAY
CLOSE UP: The little girl struggling in dark water.
COLORED CRAYONS float by her.
A MOON FACED DOLL with PURPLE EYES.
OA (V.O.)
There is glass everywhere and the
light is fading. I keep banging
against the glass but I can’t get
out. Can’t breath...
The girl tries to swim -- slams against clear glass.
INT. FOYER, ART DECO ESTATE - CONTINUOUS
Little white stocking feet run across a black and white
marble floor. Blood dribbles in her wake. The girl BURSTS
into
INT. STUDY - CONTINUOUS
A young man scoops her up on entrance--
VOICE
(Russian accent)
It’s alright, Roman. What is it,
Olenka?
The little girl scampers past her teenage brother and crawls
into her father’s arms. He has a wide compact chest like he
was poured from cement -- this is MR. AZAROV, 40s.
Olenka bleeds all over his white oxford shirt, cries into his
neck in terror--
OLENKA
It came again. The same again. I’m
underwater and I see the floating
crayons and then I can’t breathe.
58.
The bear of a man rocks his daughter in his arms. Leans her
head back, pinches her nose to hold in the blood--
MR. AZAROV
It’s just a dream my little
cabbage.
OLENKA
My eyes were open the whole time.
MR. AZAROV
It’s a day dream.
OLENKA
But I feel it just like I feel you
pinching my nose.
Mr. Azarov stands, holding his daughter close. He walks for
the door--
MR. AZAROV
(to his assistant)
Cancel this afternoon. Move
everything to this evening.
ASSISTANT
But they are driving in from
Moscow.
MR. AZAROV
Then I’m sure they will be hungry
for whatever Cook has prepared for
them.
OLENKA
Papa, I’m okay now.
MR. AZAROV
No. We are going to rid the day
time of this nightmare.
EXT. GROUNDS OF AZAROV ESTATE - AFTERNOON
A black SUBURBAN crawls slowly through 7 foot high snow
drifts.
INT. BLACK ARMORED SUV - DAY
Olenka sits beside her father in the backseat of the heavily
tinted car.
59.
MR. AZAROV
Stop here.
The driver pulls over in the snowy whiteout. Mr. Azarov gets
out wearing only his bloody shirt and pants--
MR. AZAROV (CONT’D)
Keep the car warm.
(beat)
Come on, Cabbage.
Olenka, bare stocking feet and dress, follows him out.
Mr. Azarov raps firmly on the back of the car. The trunk
pops. He opens it. Pulls out--
A TIRE-IRON
Olenka shivers in a gale of icy wind. She meets her father’s
eyes, not without fear.
SOUND: WHACK. WHACK. WHACK.
EXT. SNOWY FIELD - MOMENTS LATER
THE TIRE-IRON SLAMS AGAINST ICE. CHIPS FLY. WATER SPRAYS.
Mr. Azarov, in an undershirt, clears the shallows of the lake
from chunks of encroaching ice.
MR. AZAROV
Olenka.
Olenka, in her undergarments, bravely steps into the freezing
water.
Tears from the shock of cold spring to her eyes
involuntarily.
She pushes into the water -- thigh high -- shaking. Barely
able to speak--
OLENKA
Papa, it’s too cold. I can’t.
MR. AZAROV
What’s the only way to fight cold?
OLENKA
Become colder than it is.
Mr. Azarov nods.
60.
Olenka nods.
Doesn’t move.
Sheer terror seizes her. And then--
She dives into the water.
CUT TO:
INT. MASTER BATH - EDGE OF DEVELOPMENT - NIGHT
Steve’s jaw is slack, Buck wide-eyed, Mrs. Broderick-Allen
holds her breath.
OA speaks plainly--
OA
My father taught me to swim that
day. That night the cold snap was
so great that two of our horses
froze to death. But the image of
the aquarium never came back again.
INT. KITCHEN - AZAROV ESTATE - EARLY MORNING
A pale blue egg CRACKS against a crystal glass. Two eggs into
one glass. Two eggs into another glass. Milk follows.
OA (V.O.)
A whole year passed. My nose didn’t
bleed once.
Olenka hands a glass to her father. They both drink.
Behind them two cooks prepare breakfast. A servant bustles
through the door carrying a silver tray into the dining room
beyond --
Olenka’s two teenage brothers sit on either side of their
mother -- blond, delicate, imperious. The boys woof down
pancakes.
OA (V.O.)
I had started school now. All the
kids in the neighborhood were
picked up in a special bus. I was
always last.
61.
EXT. AZAROV ESTATE - MORNING
Bookbag in hand, Olenka runs down the snowy tree lined drive
to meet a long gray bus with heavy dark windows fringed with
ice.
INT. SCHOOL BUS - CONTINUOUS
Olenka sits beside a girl her age, Valari, who talks loudly
over the other children.
Olenka gazes out the window at clouds deepening in the sky
like a ripe bruise.
OA (V.O.)
I felt something in the pit of my
stomach. Like my eggs were sitting
there stuck, unbroken. I felt like
I wanted to get off the bus...
Olenka sinks deeper into her seat, looks at the water below
as the bus traverses a long bridge.
VALARI
Yeah, but I didn’t like it. It made
you think too much about death.
BOY
Like when the boy shoots himself.
VALARI
Yeah, like one day you are here.
And then suddenly you aren’t here.
You aren’t anywhere. Did you see
it, O?
OLENKA
I think you are always somewhere
just maybe not as you--
SOUND: DEAFENING ROAR. THE SPLITTING OPEN OF EARTH OR SKY OR
BOTH
CHILDREN PITCH FORWARD OVER SEATS
FRAGILE HEADS CRACK AGAINST THE CEILING
THE BUS SOMERSAULTS INTO WATER
BLACK.
SOUND: from underwater -- shrill screams of children who
survived the fall.
62.
Olenka breaks the surface. GASPS for air.
Almost completely dark.
The black rubber floor of the bus is the new sky.
Children floating face down.
Children treading water, shrieking, clamoring for the legs of
seats to hold on to, water SURGING up from underneath.
A panicked boy grabs Olenka’s head as a life preserver,
pushes her under.
Olenka THRASHES underwater -- sees --
Dim light glowing from windows below.
She breaks the surface again, gulps for air, dives--
COLORED CRAYONS FLOAT BY
A MOON FACED DOLL -- NO -- VALARI -- VIOLET EYES WIDE,
UNSEEING
Olenka swims for the light -- BANGS against glass.
Swims again forward -- HITS glass.
The aquarium.
No way out.
Olenka breaks the surface again.
There are fewer children struggling now.
Their mouths kiss the floor. Suck the last bubbles of oxygen
trapped above the dark water.
Olenka huddles with them.
They are all suddenly quiet together. Thinking of what is
about to befall them.
OLENKA (CONT’D)
There is light beneath us. Maybe
one of the windows is broken. If we
swim deep... maybe we could make it
out.
The cluster of children near her consider this. Look at one
another in terror.
63.
Olenka takes a massive breath.
Dives.
Swims deep.
Deeper.
One or two children plunge after her.
It’s so dark.
So cold.
Behind her, the kids turn back.
Olenka keeps swimming for--
The WINDSHIELD
CRACKED WIDE OPEN
The bus sinks now almost as fast as she’s swimming, but she
clears the glass--
Swims out into the dark of the open water--
Breath gone, Olenka makes for the light at the surface--
Lungs on fire now -- a fire that races through her thin
limbs, burns up everything inside her --
POP POP POP
Fireworks BURST in her brain
Everything goes black.
OA (V.O.)
We were a message see. To our
parents. From the Voi. And the
message said - you are powerful
businessmen to be sure, but not all
powerful. The youngest sons and
daughters of every Russian scion
was on that bus. They all died.
Every single one of them. Including
me.
EXPLOSION OF LIGHT

EXT. THE BANK, RIVER’S EDGE - DAY
Mr. Azarov, soaking wet, pounds his daughter’s chest. Hard.
Mercilessly hard. He wails. Breathes into her empty mouth.
Behind him the broken arc of the bridge -- edges charred and
smoking. Police lights flashing.
MR. AZAROV
Don’t you leave me here, Olenka
Azarov. Don’t you leave me alone
here.
He breathes into her mouth again. Pounds her chest with his
sledgehammer fists--
AIR HEAVES INTO OLENKA
She vomits water and motor oil everywhere.
Mr. Azarov sobs. Gathers Olenka into his arms.
Her eyes flutter open over his shoulder -- the whites of them
are BLOOD RED. Olenka gropes at her face, then at his...

120,9th Wonder (Slicker This Year),"[J-Yak]

Bang With Jackson, the anglo-saxon
Can't see him on cash, like Abraham's hat brim
Slowly Baffling, every rapper that's aft'r him
Nothing but back rim, my buzz sorta like packed tins
The flows heavy, they can't swim, provide levies
Like Jackson, Andrew, And you, aren't ready to handle
The man who flows like glowin candles
Stand huge... getting big like growing handles
Its a scandal... tracks splitting their cantelopes
Hidden insight, im rippin mics with anecdotes
Still I Let it all fall out like Janet Jackson tho.. woah
Faded fresh off a super bowl
Genius, 9th wonder shit, send it to the funeral
Turn it to a urinal, looking back a year ago
And seeing the progression, like watching some Ch-Ch-Chias grow
I'm off the map, like commercial-driven vehicles
Free-to-blow, Smoke in the direction that Katrina roamed
In-ward, with game colder than blizzards
Cold as 'Soda pop-but, most you rappers full of bull-shit like
Derek Roses locker..Thad Matta, with buck eyes
These tough guys, are so su-prised
I dump these punchlines, must i, disrupt guys, above i?
Fuck why, cuz why not...
I made it due to Entourage jus like Saigon
Bygones are bygones, I try on these....
Various styles, then spit it back like a python
Nothing but nylon, clear to see I made it genius
I'm the addition of John Wall, don't play Arenas
I remain in Bleachers, rap as mainly features
But represent a wide possy of creative creatures
Peace up, and please up your speakers
To find out, what the hell's this Genius shit he speaks of

[John Daniel]

With or without dap, welcome to the introduction
The whereabouts in tact, help the Midwest function
Met the fork in the road, saying fuck a junction
Hear my stomach rumblin', ya label's a luncheon
Passive with the passion, hope ya seatbelts fastened
I March through Madness without fillin' out a bracket
It's me on a beat, so notepads tend to worry
You dudes put mics/Mike's to sleep like Conrad Murray
I guess I can relate, cause I end up killin' em
Or like kids were with Mike, they end up feelin' em
The haters put will in him, they say I'm well played
Some gotta face regrets everyday like Yung L.A
Young Elway, that's a well away from drying up
I'm well arranged, not the type to admire luck
Supplyin' snuff, while these fuck boys advancin
Been seein' bars so long, call me young Chuck Manson
This ya last hope, watch the lead start freelancin'
'Til you walkin' 'longside ghosts, like Ted Danson
You are just a stand in, the masses ain't feelin' ya
That's cool, I'm Gadhafi and the rest is playing Libya
I've had enough, so it's time to alarm 'em quick
Goin' 'gainst my whole branch, y'all armed with sticks
There's never been +GOOD Music+ without Common Sense
Wait, there's never been +GOOD Music+ without a Consequence
I'm a problem, #5 when the evens were assigned
There's no solvin', 'less you tryna stay far from behind
I'm not a poor soul, or rich with talent
But I've been pushin' it to a T, half comprised of Malice
I've arrived as valid, try to adjust to this balance
Had the game pick my brain and gave it a cleft pallete
We have you surrounded, crowd dumbfounded
Pound for pound I leave 'em numb, and found dead

[Devers]

Its the face of a genius, tho the eyes of a fighter
I see em Christian bail and run out at the spark of my lighter
In spite of, the sight of doom when its present
I close the door upon the devil when its knockin from on top of the heavens
And in my presence fail inevitably, please
Puts your guns down clown and fix your wobbly knees
365 days and even more ways im killem
I turned em 360 degrees and hung up the will in em
I tend to give a little back, every track cold
Said infact, reynold wrap tight... with black soles
And these plaques show... they can't fuck with me
Still around, round 3, see me swinging for more
So..close... heart outta my chest, at best
Flex, tryna show my double helix/he-lexxx
So suprised so repressed...blessed
Evil genius smarts, flow’s growin from the start
Showin.. how a pro stays throwin darts
Locally grown, so close to the throne
Tho these people only see me in the light thats been shown
Til im blowin up the west, im kobe strokin his best
Im always close to the gold, the treasure beats in my chest
My pleasure to bring you rhymes you neva eva contest with
So pull the lever, devers check this
Ever so invested, sicker than congested
Noses snortin powdery compounds, born to astound
Born to with stand, the mighty altered hand of the man
The band stand bangs, the snare maintains
The beat seeps in creeps through my deep veins
Could you, tell me why should I stay sane?
Holdin the same mic that flamed your gang with propane
Ey... but its really just a peace sign thang
Throw it up while my shit bangs.. while my shit bangs

[ExZ]

They never honest in responses, fit predictability
The villain in the will of me is killing me
Questioning ability and billing me, finding ways to tax Zach
I swear - emotions fluctuate as much as the Nasdaq
It's funny, hung around this cold girl called karma
Never listened to the bitch, in regard to my honor
Got my Berlin Wall on - so nothing she could call upon
Till shame caved in, the dialed buttons she garnered -
Now-, from living with her grew quickly sick of the bitching
So the only girl I'm kissing now, my mother and sisters
Know another bitch always hooked on material matters
Tryna' contemplate myself whether material matters
You say that you believe in me; for all the wrong reasons
Grieve that I don't need you, I don't need appeasement
You don't know me, and I don't want to know who you are
But it's ironic.... She gives me substance for bars, yeah
It's two slashes with your soul in the middle
Going bowling with my motives so he roll in the riddles
But there's a role in the riddles, I just try to make sense of it
Incentives lit for sentences and censoring the censorship
My mother tells me that my touch strikes gold
But they don't see it.... See I don't rock nice clothes
Like, tell me dude, who you tryna impress?
If you around a lot of gavels you allow in distress
It's the struggle to survive and resist, in difference
With the struggle to take it in and make amends with being different
Now tell me, what;s the one thing in the world that can be on itself?
My mind is on my mind, so they questioning my honest health
But fuck it, I know where I'm at, and where I'm 'bout to be
Get out your seats with ""how can he's"" and stretched arms outwardly
....These motherfuckers tryna shake my hand
But I put it on my mother you'll never break my man.. nah",J-Yak,1994,"[100, 95, 85, 84, 80, 83, 83]",7
121,Fantastic Voyage,"[Verse 1: Coolio]
Come on y'all, let's take a ride
Don't ya say shit just get inside
It's time to take your ass on another kind of trip
Cuz you can't have the hop if you don't have the hip
Grab you gat with the extra clip
And close your eyes and hit the switch
We're going to a place where everybody kick it, kick it, kick it
Yea that's the ticket
Ain't no bloodin, ain't no crippin
Ain't no punk ass niggas set trippin'
Everybody got a stack and it ain't no crack
And it really don't matter if you're white or black
I wanna take you there like the Staple Singers
Put something in the tank, and I know that I can bring ya
If ya can't take the heat get ya ass out the kitchen
We on a mission

[Hook]
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide, slide slippity slide
I'm hittin switches on the block in a 65
Come along and ride on fantastic voyage
Slide, slide hoo ride, ain't no valley low enough or mountain high

[Verse 2: Coolio]
I'm tryin to find a place where I can live my life and
Maybe eat some steak with my beans and rice
A place where my kids can play outside without livin in fear of a drive by
And even if I get away from them drive by killaz
I still gotta worry about those snitch ass niggas
I keep on searchin' and I keep on lookin'
But niggas are the same from Watts to Brooklyn
I try to keep my faith in my people
But sometimes my people be actin' like they evil
You don't understand about runnin' with a gang
Cause you don't gang bang
And you don't have to stand on the corner and slang
Cause you got your own thang
You can't help me if you can't help yourself
You better make a left

[Hook]
Come along and ride on a Fantastic Voyage
Slide, slide slippity slide
I do what I do just to survive
(Come along and ride on a Fantastic Voyage)
Slide slide hoo ride, that's why I pack my 45

[Verse 3: Coolio]
Life is a bitch and then you die
Still trying to get a piece of that apple pie
Every game ain't the same cause the game still remain
Don't it seem kinda strange ain't a damn thing changed
If you don't work then you don't eat
And only down ass niggas can ride with me
Hip hop hop your 45 quickly down the block
Stay sucker free and keep the busters of your jock
You gotta have heart son if you wanna go
Watch this sweet chariot, swing low
Ain't nobody crying ain't nobody dyin'
Ain't nobody worryin' everybody's tryin'
Nothing from nothin' leaves nothin'
If you wanna have somethin' you better stop frontin'
What you gonna do when the 5 rolls by?
You better be ready so you can ride

[Hook]
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide slippity slide if you're living in the city it's do or die
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage

And I'd like to give a shout-out to my niggas with a game plan
And shout-outs to my niggas with escape plans

We could either rain check or we can make plans
Pockets loaded, rocket loaded, okay, let's rock and roll this
It's time to go, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels
Locked and loaded, diamonds glowing, chart-climbing on 'em

The new design, it's time to shine
To shine, to shine, to shine, to shine
I hustle, I flex, the world is mine
So please believe, allow the greaze

I make the devil go weak the knees
You hate, you're lame, your loss

They know it's me, the hat and the shades
They heard my voice and they ran to the stage

I've been hit by your love and it's all that I see
So much happiness now belongs to me
I've been hit by your love for the very first time
And I know you're the one, baby you're mine

It turns out that we like the same movies
We even like the same songs
I can't believe that there is someone like you
I can't believe I waited so long
What we have is something so special
A connection I hope won't be broken too soon
I just need you to tell me you love me
So I can be with you

CHORUS

I never thought that I needed another
Until the day I saw you
Everything I said I didn't want was
In front of me and so true
When you smiled I knew I was in for it
Your sweet face told me all that I needed to know
From that moment I knew what love was
And I hope that you did too

128,Watermelon Crawl,"[Verse 1]
I was drivin' through Georgia in late July
On a day hot enough to make the devil sigh
I saw a homemade sign writtin' in red
Rhine county watermelon festival ahead

[Verse 2]
Well, I wasn't in a hurry so I slowed down
Took a two lane road to a one horse town
There was a party goin' on when I got there
I heard a welcome speech from a small town mayor

[Chorus]
He said we got a hundred gallons of sweet red wine
Made from the biggest watermelons on the vine
Help yourself to some, but obey the law
If you drink don't drive do the watermelon crawl

[Verse 3]
When the band started playin the watermelon queen
Said let me show you somethin' that you ain't never seen
She grabbed me by the arm said come on let's go
She dipped down, spun around, and do-ce-doed

[Verse 4]
She rocked back on her heels dropped down to her knees
She craweled across the floor and jumped back to her feet
She wiggled and she giggled and be all you ever saw
She said this is how you do the watermelon crawl

[Chorus]
He said we got a hundred gallons of sweet red wine
Made from the biggest watermelons on the vine
Help yourself to some, but obey the law
If you drink don't drive do the watermelon crawl

[Bridge]
If your ever down in Georgia around about July
If you ain't in a hurry then you oughta stop by
I can guarantee that you're goin have a ball
Learnin' how to do the watermelon crawl

[Chorus]
He said we got a hundred gallons of sweet red wine
Made from the biggest watermelons on the vine
Help yourself to some, but obey the law
If you drink don't drive do the watermelon crawl
Yeah, do the watermelon crawl

I know you want lots a jewels and stuff
Backyards with swimming pools, bars with stools and stuff
Fancy foods - Lobster, Sushi
Gear - Versace, Gucci, crazy Lucci
I know your M.O., you do demo on a paycheck
You get a Herb from the 'burb and show him no respect
Middle name ""Price Tag,"" first name ""Gotcha""
Started slow, got on a roll, now they can't stop you
Talking about ""Hey Boo, how you do?""
Some clown uptown said you ran through his crew
I give you props and ya credit cause it's due
But I ain't that clown, and my crew ain't that crew
Time's too hard to be faking like I'm dating on some steak
And...wining and dining, I ain't choking on no chicken

For nathan, for jack, for doodly-squat, you can do me not
You plan on plot on who be hot and trying to hit the slot
I know your low pro style, your low (whole/ho) profile
Kick a bother in the gut and then you smile
I must admit; I really dig your operation
Every time we on the phone, you got the sexy conversation
So now you hope to be the woman of my dream
And while I'm sleeping, you'll be creeping, robbing me clean
I see you hanging on the corners with the rest of your girl crew
Standing by the gutter with your booty cutters
So who's the honey dip, down with the money grip
Always got a plan and a scam to get some money quick
Always gettin' with the next man, the one with the checks
And setting up a trap with the sexing

You give me feelings like I'm dealing with a crooked hand
You got a grand from a man cause you shook his hand
You're well known in the streets, in the gutters
So fly, when you caught my eye, you made me stutter
You come around with your curls and your pretty pearls
You even been around the world, so you go, girl
But where's the love at
Tell me where's the hugs at
Acting like a Rugrat
I know where you bought that
Don't try to gas me, girl, I know the streets well

And you're making trick-n-treats sell

Worked out this bitch, marched like an athlete
Jewels in my crib, forgot to throw shine on
Minor, you know the grind I'm on?
Need cheese like yesterday
A hundred K, made 50 now I've got the rest to make,
On a conquest hunting the sceme, long quest
See a bredda jump in the beams?
Beeped the horn and bounced pumpin' Skream and Benga
Saw a doorway too discrete to enter
Yo, I wasn't sure so I fell back
Could've been a rave but where the girls at
Smelled damp in the air
Weed smoking, booze but no shouts in the air
Then I felt a door shut behind me
Pitch black nothin in my sight to guide me

Caught on the dark side of the strobe, you're standing in the cold
But baby I'll be right beside ya
Feeling the thunder of the sub go running through your blood
Close your eyes and I'm gonna find ya

Put your hand in my hand, and let go
Cuz' tonight is gonna blow, you know you're not alone
Baby I'll be right beside ya

[Verse 2: Smiler]
Then a hand took mine, felt soft though, gotta be a good sign, then a voice ""who brought you in stranger, you're so tense you thought yous in danger huh?""
My mind going round in a mad one, who's tryna set me up or who has done
Who I got beef with, who I ain't squashed with
Tryna fling young smiles in a box quick
Scent of the weed getting stronger, closer
Still can't see a thing, pitch black
Shit that happens in a movie
Whats next, it happened so smoothly
The pace of the her footsteps slowed down
She turned to me and said to me casually:
""What you about to see is a showdown""
And then the door flung back, anarchy

And when the world said no, she asked the stars

He never really watched the news

[Verse 2]
I guess they fell in love, if you can call it that
And for a couple of years, all smooth things went, you know
Desperate people, they go to desperate measures
But she so badly wanted kids
She said, ""It's what I'm meant to do""

And he tells her, ""All I want to do is stand next to you
All I want to do is stand next to you""
Well you need to get on top of me

And do this thing before I'm fifty
And dry as a bone

It's just a bootie call

Hey baby, turn around

Must be in the genes

Only want to have fun
No time to get sprung

Why must I chase the cat
Nothing but the dog in me
Why must I feel like that
Why must I chase the cat
Nothing but the dog in me

Might want to settle down
But on my wedding night I feel
I'm gonna play around

Life is too short to lie
I mean no disrespect at all
But if the other woman's on my mind
On my life, it's a booty call

Checking out the back

Winter's freezing
Chasing that cat
All through the season
Hey, yo, girl, stop teasing

Check your trips
Cause I really wanna stroke
You're saying I'll drown
I'm saying you'll choke

Back at my place
Face to face
I'm trying to be good
So we can cut to the chase

Welcome to Earth, third rock from the sun

She walks into Smokey's
One hip at a time
Like a broken field runner
Slippin' through the lines
He likes the way she looks
So he calls a little wife
Says don't wait up for me
I'll be workin late tonight
Wife hangs up the phone bursts into tears
Calls her sister up and cries get over here

Sister tells her boyfriend be back in awhile
Boyfriend wants a beer, the store is just a mile
Leaves the motor runnin' he'll only be a minute
His car drives away with teenagers in it
Driver tells his buddies, got one life to live
They scream into the night, lets get it over with

Cause and effect, chain of events
All of the chaos makes perfect sense
When we're spinnin' round
Things come undone
Welcome to the Earth, third rock from the sun

The kid guns the gas, car starts to swerve
Heads for a semi-truck, jumps the curb
Truck hits a bigboy in the Shoney's parking lot
Flies through the air, takes out the bank clock
Clock strikes a light pole, transformer sparks
Lines go down, town goes dark

Waitress calls the cops says she saw it all
Swears a giant alien has landed at the mall
Cops ring up the mayor says there's panic in the street
Hate to wake you up but we can't find the chief
Mayor says use your head, if he ain't in his car
He's hiding from his wife, down at Smokey's bar

Cause and effect, chain of events
All of the chaos makes perfect sense
When we're spinnin' round
Things come undone
Welcome to the Earth, third rock from the sun

Cause and effect, chain of events
All of the chaos makes perfect sense

Stay lo, like Ralph lip stock, hit the Mary, won't kiss and tell
My lips locked but my grip's not so I pass it off
Real burners, and we ashing off your furniture
Fuck your couch, bitch, hush your mouth

These chickens don't love me, they love the account
But they will never know what's the amount, I keep the hoes in check
'Til they bounce, don't ever let a chick see you withdrawn
These niggas want to know what I draw with
But won't respond to what I've drawn

Cella phone, but my line stay hella blown
Hella blown, hella blown

Yo Houston, we got a problem, copy
Four, five hotties in the lobby
Said that they can blow the rockets properly, but blow up spots and never stop
Like them aki's, they never get aqui to my property

Young Jason for them dollars in the mix like teriyaki
And round four, I force my large Versace
Over my big head, cause I don't live here, she getting too cocky
Won't spot me in no closet
I ain't like Kels and them
Her closet full of arm limbs and a skeleton

Better tell that doofus deuces before he catch a whipping
Hit him in his Charles Dickens and strip him for his Scottie Pippens
Cause it's all about the big pimping
Rob him for his Nixon, and then question him about his timing
Right here, it gets reckless, best advice is
To tuck your necklace, and put your arms right back into your Lexus
Cause G-Stone Crips, they ain't nothing
To flex with, and billy gang Pyru, they really on some next shit
So if I were you I would probably ride with two
No fool, not two dudes, two tools
As in deuce-deuce cause niggas jack you for your soul
And your new shoes and your jewels too
There's something about another nigga having shit
That have a nigga spazzing clips all up in your back and dip
Cause it's all about bagging the baddest chick
Stacking them chicks up in Saks Fifth

Uh

Pointing out the obvious
Like damn you're such a hottie miss
Yo body is flyer than karate kicks
I’ll Mr. Miyagi this beat it on some Rodney ish
And these girls are probably pissed
Cause you're greater than Ali is
And you're perfection, I’m just great can you work with that?
Same people hate probably still think the earth is flat
And I swear we'd be the perfect match
And I just hope it made you smile when you heard this rap
Because

Girl you out of sight like Stevie
Believe me, She's thee one the fellas love
And all the girls are jealous of

Wanna be the nigga with ya, Cause I see the bigger picture
Her looks catch you eyes, But her personality get ya
That's why I dig ya, Cause it's deeper than the surface
Damn and that girl's still stunning at her turfst
I put verses in hearses so you can purchase some purses
I'm not saying you're perfect but I understand that you're worth it
Cause you the type of girl I plan on leaving this earth wit
And when I have my first kid I pray that you birth it
Cause, You on fire like Pryor you're my desire

Why am I trapped in a cage?
(THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)
Barber can I get a fade?
(THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)
Teacher teacher check my grades
(THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)
I grab the mic in a RAGE...

[Verse 1: Wyclef]
You maintain to put a negro in pain you used to diss me
""You sure you wanna hang with old Eddie Kane?""
Ain't nuttin wrong, so snap your head to the song
Word is bond, you get wrong, I'll have you sing like Louis Armstrong
''And I say to myself, what a wonderful world''
But what the fuck was so wonderful
Bout picking cotton -- on a farm?!
The harder they come, the harder they fall
So come one come all
Don't stall or I'mma stick you like a voodoo doll
Doors locked stop draw for the count, who drops?
Ten-nine-eight-seven-six-five-four-three-two-one-
-you-slept-on-a-kid-from-the-boondocks
Out of Hooterville land of the ill kill
Bellsburg Viking so you know I'm top ranking Phil
Some say newcomer like the yuma but save the rumor
Cause I've been rockin ever since eighty-three
When I used to rock my Pumas
Rap, narcotic psychotic, so hear the statistic
One out of ten, I'm passin the mic next time I'll get WICKED
Heard the man who went before, got intimated
You tried to gas me up, too much gas, you got intoxicated
You wasn't ready for the real'n, dealin, chillin
Wyclef, no competition when I'm bringin pure death
I'm jumpin like a monkey to get mines off
A-from a caterpillar, to the mic moth

[Pras]
You put, one and one together now you think you a rapper
Baseball cap backward, forearms swingin like a hip-hopper
You do the rhyme, thinkin no one can stop ya
I be the followin that chop ya down as I clock ya, hah
When I say five-oh, I mean fifty not guns or cops
Now here's the heavyweight knocker, the freedom fighter
Natural rhythm rock a mic I always rhyme I'm never drinkin vodka
Any old style, I throw it in a locker

[Lauryn Hill]
Well I'm a Gucci rocker, I never drank no vodka
Me got no bag of cheeba cause I never had a knocker
My cousin's name was Shaka, for short we called him 'Aka
I flip it on wack MC's because to me they flow like caca

[Pras]
You boogie move the groove, nothing to prove you lose
Your style remind of yesterday, old news
Sad sung blues who's, chose the one to feel the pain
Or bring the cane, tick-tock I come to pick your lock
It's not for capital gain
So watch out for the remain, or cry from bloodstain
Bustin nuts, bustin style
Gettin buckwild some think I'm the descendant of a wilder child
Comin on the mic, from a higher level
Broke is no joke, choke the hell out of the devil

[Wyclef]
Yo who got the power, to make a man raise from the dead?
Some said that it was Jesus, they said he was a notty dread
But I don't mean to confuse a world that's confused
Mind's atomic, so like a bomb, let me drop it
Can't get too deep, cause some sleep while I wake
In a dream that's made of wine but let me bring it back to grapes
Teacher, explain the parable, it's simple:
It's easier for the camel to go through the eye of a needle
Than for you to enter the kingdom, or battle
And walk away, with the title when I get, brutal
Feelings are mutual so sign your life, to Prudential
Don't even flinch, the other becomin spiritual
There's six million ways to die but choose four
Cause I can still be in the desert buttnaked and be HARDCORE!

[Lauryn Hill]
When ? checks that means pump your fist
Remember Moses people, this is Exodus
Don't try to stop this, the force comes from Genesis
Them who did us wrong, ask the Lord for forgiveness
The land that I’m from ain’t the land of the dumb
We droppin the bass drum, then we ??
You can’t kill the battle with a horn, blam blam, Silly Joshua
So march to St. Lawrence
Yo march I got your back, march!

Major crime made me grind, copped fancy heat
You know hater time, cat food, Fancy Feast
Dated Nancy niece, she like candy treats
God damn she sweet, we did Delancey Street
We hopped the D train, you don't understand the streets
No hassle heffer, did we battle? Never
We went Easter shoppin', coppin' them tassled leathers
From Gimbels with game, make it simple and plain
I wanna nibble on ya ear, rekindle the flame
I'm God's child, but yeah I got devilish game
Once you meddle wit' Cam, ma'am it's never the same
So you through with the peekin'?
You pursuin' and seekin'? You know the season
Killa, what you doin' this weekend? Huh? Killa, Killa!

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Killa, uh, Killa, uh
Some say that I'm belligerent, others say that I'm ignorant
I don't just experiment, intimate not my sentiment
Every day at the tenement, yayo like I invented it
Scrambled just like eggs, like eggs to benedict
They don't ever remember shit, all they want is their membership
Only one that they gettin' is jackets, that's the end of it
They want designer recliner along with benefits
Won't take a risk, but wanna spend a mick
Wipe 'em off my agenda quick, I need the other gender thick
You see my Monday to Fridays, I need a Friday to Sunday
We'll eat Friday's on Fridays, and go to Sunday's on Sundays
Drink a little liquor, maybe twist a L
Play catch and kiss, if you don't kiss and tell
Take the city bus or come through with chauffeurs
We could do Air Ones hun or Louie loafers
Yeah I'm truly focused, take down your Snoopy posters
Put up Killa Season's, now who the reason?
Come through this weekend, huh? Huh?.. Killa

Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh
Killa, Killa, Killa, uh
I drive big cars, puff heaven haze
Not just the weekend, that's seven days
Rev up the engine, not a lemon, it's lemon
That's the color, wanna play 7-11?
You know catch and hump, your butt gotta extra rump
Forget ya man, extra clip, extra pump
Don't mean to be extra, but ma..I extra stunt
Extra money, extra piff, extra blunts
Extra, extra, really some neck I want
Not the dude for help, but you're truly felt
Ass fat, stomach flat, I could see ya Louie belt
Mine on too, for any gunplay
I'm a troublemaker, yeah yeah some say
You're model material, you need a runway
So let's runaway, we could hit the runway
Round-trip not a one way, come play

Back on Sunday, make work Monday, huh? Killa

Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

[Verse 1]
I remember (back in the days)
When I just a little niggarole
I looked up to my bigger bro
Begged if I could kick it so
When he went out with girls I could go tagging along
Nagging if she had a sis maybe could mack a baby hoodrat
Y'all remember way back then, when it was 1985
All the way live, I think I was about ten
One of those happy little niggas singing the blues
That be always trying to bag with the shag and karate shoes
Sayin ""Yo momma black; his momma this, his momma that""
Then he get mad and wanna scrap
We stay mad about, ten minutes then it's like back on the bike
To play hide and go get it with the younger hoes by the bungalows
Then switch to playing ding dong ditch, when that gets
Old and too cold to hack it, threw on a bomber jacket
You could tell the ballers cuz they bell wearing Gazelles
And if they really had money raised be sporting BK's
And, all the girls had they turkish link
If it broke then they made earrings to it, like they meant to do it
But, sometimes, I still sit and reminisce
Then, think about the years I was raised, back in the days

I'm still back in the days, but now the year is '87
'88 that's when my crew and I were in junior high
In 7th grade, I hated school (wish it'd blown up)
No doubt I couldn't wait to get out (and be a grownup)
But let me finish this reminiscing and telling
'Bout when girls was belling tight corduroys like for the boys
Basket weaves, Nike Cortez, and footsie socks
And eating pickles, with tootsie pops
And it don't stop, I'm glad cause when J.J. Fad hit
Supersonic it was kinda like a sport to wear biker shorts
Or to wear jeans and it seemed like the masses
Of hoochies had Poison airbrushed on they asses
Dudes had on Nike suits, and the Pumas with
The fat laces cause it was either that or K-Swiss
I miss those days and so I pout like a grown jerk
Wishing all I had to do now, was finish homework
It's true, you don't realize really what you got til it's gone
And I'm not, gonna sing another sad song, but
Sometimes I do sit and reminisce then
Think about the years I was raised, back in the days

But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore

But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

Well, it's the niggarole, I figure that now I'm all grown up
Because I'm eighteen years old, and guess you could say I'm holding
Down a steady job and crew steady mobbing
You steady bobbing your head and I'm paid, so I got it made
But, didn't always have clout, used to live in South Central L.A
That's where I stayed and figured a way out
I gave it all I had so for what it's worth
I went from rags to riches which is a drag but now I'm first
So Ahmad and The Jones' is on our way up
Yup, we said that we was gonna make it since a kid
And we finally did, but
Sometimes I still sit and reminisce then
Think about the years I was raised, back in the days

[Hook]
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

Everyday I need an ounce and a half, S.P
The only flower that you know, with a bounce and a half
Listen kid, I need a mountain of cash so I could roll up
Hop in the whip and like, bounce to the ave
I get high cause I'm in the hood, the guns is around
It take a blunt, just to ease the pain that humbled me now (whew)
And I'd rather roll somethin' up; cause if I'm sober dog
I just might flip, grab my guns and hold somethin' up
I get high as a kite; I'm in the zone all alone
Motherfucker case I'm dyin' tonight (it happen tonight)
So I roll 'em up, back to back, fat as I could (uh-huh)

Smoke like a chim-in-ney {*inhaling*}, matter fact I
Smoke like a gun, when a killer see his enemy

That I smoke like the hippies did, back in the 70's
Spit with the finishin' touch - get this, that
I'ma finish you before I finish the dutch
I get high like the birds and the planes, I get high when
Bullets hit faces after words exchanged
I get a rush, off the blood on the walls, you understand?
Like the M-5 pedal when it's touchin' the floor
I get high cause fuck it, what's better to do?
And I'mma never give a fuck (that's right) cause I'm better than you

I'mma smoke till my lungs collapse; I'm from a era where
Niggas cause terror over guns and crack
Where a dollar bill is powerful; I smoke weed cause
Time seem precious and I know what a hour do (I know dat)
High for a livin', gots ta ride for a livin'
With my real gangsta niggas that'll die for a livin' (die my niggas)
Shit I get as high as I could; cause if you see things
Like I see things, that I'mma die in the hood (right here)
Motherfucker understand it's full service to you
I don't smoke the weed if it ain't purple or blue
And you could name any rapper, if you want he could die (anybody)
This is S.P., dump it in you bitch, I get high

168,Don't Take The Girl,"[Verse 1]
Johnny's daddy was takin' him fishin'
When he was eight years old
A little girl came through the front gate
Holdin' a fishin' pole
His dad looked down and smiled
Said, ""We can't leave her behind
Son, I know you don't want her to go
But someday you'll change your mind""

[Pre-Chorus]
And Johnny said:

[Chorus 1]
Take Jimmy Johnson, take Tommy Thompson
Take my best friend, Bo
Take anybody that you want as
Long as she don't go
Take any boy in the world
Daddy, please, don't take the girl

[Verse 2]
Same old boy, same sweet girl
Ten years down the road
He held her tight and kissed her lips in
Front of the picture show
Stranger came and pulled a gun
Grabbed her by the arm
Said, ""If you do what I tell you to, there
Won't be any harm""

[Pre-Chorus]
And Johnny said:

[Chorus 2]
Take my money, take my wallet
Take my credit cards
Here's the watch that my grandpa gave me
Here's the key to my car
Mister, give it a whirl
But, please, don't take the girl

[Verse 3]
Same old boy, same sweet girl
Five years down the road
There's gonna be a little one and she
Says, ""It's time to go""
Doctor says, ""The baby's fine
But you'll have to leave
'Cause his momma's fadin' fast"" and
Johnny hit his knees

[Pre-Chorus]
And then he prayed:

[Chorus 3]
Take the very breath you gave me
Take the heart from my chest
I'll gladly take her place if you'll let me
Make this my last request
Take me out of this world

Look... You know that so many people be askin me like
""Man, how do you do it? How do you stay happy in love?""
Ehehe, I think it's really just a state of mind
I mean, I know single men that would kill for a home-cooked meal
I know, married men that'll kill for a quiet house
Haha shit it's just, it's just all depend on your perspective
Youknahmean? Ain't nothin' perfect

[Phonte]
Yo, my mind in another zone, and voice in another tone
Arguin about some shit rooted in some other shit
Long story short, it was a night that I ain't feel like comin home
So I hit the streets, to a couple places I ain't hit for weeks
Saw a pretty girl, kissed her cheek - mwah, say magnifique
She favored my ex, some harmless flirtin
A total diversion, but sometimes that's all
A nigga need to get from one day to the next
She's placin her bets, and payin respect
Next thing, we walkin out and I'm payin the check
Aw man..

[Hook: Carlitta Durand]
No pretending, baby I'm sending
Sending, all my love to you

[Phonte]
Here she goes again, I can feel her eyes closin in
It's like a rigged game, but how the fuck am I supposed to win?
The O.G. say, ""Cheer up""
But wifey wants a scholar and a traveler
Hunter and a gatherer, and after I capture her
Now I gotta put +MY+ spear up?
Man, I don't fear much
But the thought of losing her hits me in the tear ducts
Too much honesty ahead, get earplugs
Something in the way society rears us
Commitment wears us, out it tears us, apart
And makes us feel we don't need to
And that turns into ""I don't need you""
People want what grandma and granddaddy had
But they ain't have options, nigga, we do
And we choose, to act foolish
Not Jewish, but when you hurt a man, baby he bruise/He-brews/Hebrews
Can barely handle one, I don't need two
Really don't wanna run, but I need to
I need to...Lemme get outta here

175,Willing To Forgive,"[Verse 1]
I read her letters
And I saw her picture
And I smelled her cheap perfume
It must have come from you
How could you touch her?
Lay down beside her?
Well, there just ain't no excuse
You shouldn't have been so loose

[Pre-Chorus]
I saw the telephone bill
You must be out of your mind
If you think you can smooth it over
Then you're wasting your time

[Chorus]
Well, I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget
'Cause you really, really, really, really hurt me this time
And I guess I can go on although I must admit
I've been busy, busy, busy, busy thinking that I'm gonna mess around some time

[Verse 2]
You're such a liar
You took her and her children
Out for the afternoon
While I was sittin' waitin' on you
How could you do it?
You should've been here with me
You just couldn't do it
You had to be in the streets

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I heard through the grapevine
You've been messin' around
When you thought you were gettin' over
That's when a baby girl found out

[Chorus]
Well, I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget
'Cause you really, really, really, really hurt me this time
(You really hurt me)
And I guess I can go on although I must admit
I've been busy, busy, busy, busy thinking that I'm gonna mess around some time

[Bridge]
I gave my heart, gave my time
Gave my soul 'cause love was blind
I can't explain this poor excuse
Of a man, of a boy who was born to lose
I paid the rent, washed your clothes
Cooked your food and only God knows
Only God knows why I stay with you
I guess (Guess I) I'm in love

[Chorus]
Well, I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget
(Oh, baby, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love)
'Cause you really, really, really, really hurt me this time
(Ooh, you really hurt me this time, baby)
And I guess I can go on although I must admit (Although I must admit)
I've been busy, busy, busy, busy thinking that I'm gonna mess around some time
(I'm gonna mess around some time)

[Bridge]
I gave my heart, gave my time
Gave my soul 'cause love was blind
I can't explain this poor excuse
Of a man, of a boy who was born to lose
I paid the rent, I washed your clothes
Cooked your food and only God knows
Only God knows why I stay with you
I guess I...I'm in love

[Chorus]
Well, I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget
'Cause you really, really, really, really hurt me this time
(Ooh, oh, baby, you hurt me, you hurt me)

I've been busy, busy, busy, busy thinking that I'm gonna mess around some time

[Verse 1:]
Back in the day
When my mama was raising me
I never could understand the statement
Stand behind your man

I'd rather be by his side
Sharing the load
So he can see things from my point of view
And read my thoughts

[Chorus:]
I'm a 90's girl
Willing and able
Proving that I'm capable
And I'm to go for what I know
(I know)

And I'm going for the best

Cause you know I'll pass
And love can last

Show me some respect

I'm a 90's girl
In an ice cold world
Independent and strong
I can make it on my own

Criticize my effort is
To get what I want
I use it because you fear an equilibrium

Just because I wear some sexy clothes
That don't mean take advantage
And assume I'll go

How can a man be a man
Have the upper hand and signal

Grab ya head nigga, start bobbin it
The underground's bein' shook down, PMD's robbin it
So crack the old gold, yeah, and spark the Phillie blunts
I'm chumpin niggas down takin minds on a manhunt
(Quote unquote kid), dont get caught up in the gunsmoke
It's rap huntin' season, and I'm blastin niggas who showboat
With that pretty-boy R&B rap, back with a hiphop track - say that, Сause thats whack, and niggas ain't trying to hear that
Can't get sidetracked, so bust the impact
To get the bozack, and mind yo beeswax
Still in the game but somethin' changed

What's this - another funky hit from the squad kid?
No time for comebacks black, time to run shit
So pass that microphone, plug it into the soundboard
Scratch cuts the wax, chop it like a chainsaw
So who's callin my name?
Been doin' this since 87' cause this is my thing
Can't forget Jane haircut, like Anita Baker
Never seen no one faker, to make the mistake to
Try to push up on a brother, who brainstorms
You know I'm psycho, crazy, like that man Nor-man Bates
Wait, excuse me but it's the ism
That makes me hesitate, no time to translate
Gotta go kid, time to motivate
Back to the blackzone, cause it's no thing

What's up with all these corny niggas
Makin faces on my TV screen
Can't shoot this tube, cause if I do it makes 19
No time for the crime scene
Grab my Bozack, and my mic, time to beam
Back to the underground, home of beat-downs
Drop some ill shit like this, for the niggas to leave round town
Hardcore, hittin' switches In the '64
3-wheel motion, or the Benz with the 4-door
Troopin past the local spot
Niggas wanna act up, and Niggas catch the speedknot
Not trying to promote viloence But thats the way it is
The code of the ghetto ain't got shit to do with showbiz
Remember that
Yeah, still bustin' brains, yeah

179,You Let Your Heart Go Too Fast,"Having been by that old bank tower
I'm inclined to wonder why you feel so strong
You can't have really seen the hour
If you think she's trying to do you wrong
I see you got that lump in your throat
I hear you mumbling, ""That's all she wrote.""
Love is in the next room drinking antidote

You ought to know that girl by now
She'll never settle down anyhow
You let your heart go too fast
You let your heart go too fast

Broken glass turns back to flint and sand
I only cease to love as love demands
As you know it takes a while to clap those
Fragments from your idle hands
Couple months could dry a sea of tears
Leave only salt beneath our dried up piers
We won't believe we cared, I swear, in a couple years

You ought to know that girl by now
She'll never settle down anyhow
You let your heart go too fast
You let your heart go too fast

If time heals all wounds, don't you know that
Time also deals them
The days go by, and everybody feels them
We struggle with our fates
But our action only seals them

They say that murder ain't the fault of the weapon
I'm smoking sad to be the gun
I want to blow you all away, but I don't want to put no
Bullets into anyone
I see the feathers that infringe your heart
I see the blood ooze from around the dart
Cupid spites the sense that keeps two
Mismatched souls apart

You ought to know that girl by now
She'll never settle down anyhow
You let your heart go too fast
You let your heart go too fast

You ought to know that girl by now
She'll never turn you down anyhow
You let your heart go too fast
You let your heart go too fast

You let your heart go too fast
You let your heart go too fast
You let your heart go too fast

180,I'm Not Over You,"[Verse 1]
You were a bird, I was a stone
I never wanted you to go
If I had wings would you have left me?
You flew away with no goodbye
And left me asking myself ""why?""
This all came to you so easily

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I cannot replace
The way your coldness tastes
It's dead and gone, I know
But I can't let myself let you go

[Chorus]
I'm not over you yet
I still drink to forget
And wake up thinking that you've
Come back to me
And now that I'm seeing straight
It's obvious you couldn't stay
To face the hangover
You just wanna stay awake
'til it's over
Until it's over

[Verse 2]
In this empty room I see
All these ghosts and memories
My eyes connect me to the world
That is not real
All these bottles by my bed
Cannot erase you from my head
Or even numb me from the way I feel

Cause I cannot replace
The way your coldness tastes
It's dead and gone, I know
But I can't let myself let you go

I watched you fly
Fly away from me
You left me standing on the ground
Never turned to look back down

Cause I won't ever need
To put myself through this again

Cause I cannot replace
The way your coldness tastes
It's dead and gone, I know

Please, ain't nothing but incense in my atmosphere
I'm bending corners in my 'Lac, boi
'Cause that's how we be rolling here
Deep, the slang is in effect because it's Georgia
Kicking the khakis and Adidas
Packing yo' heaters 'cause you 'sposed to, cousin
Catfish and grits is how my flow flows
Rolling steady in that Caddy but them 50 bottles got to go
See, juice and gin used to be my friend from the beginning
Now I'm just a player sipping sauce every now and then
To catch a buzz like a bumble bee

My heat is in the trunk along with that quad knock
No, my heart don't pump no Kool-Aid
Jump and you'll get too sprayed

Many a nigga falling fast and I continue blasting, swiftly
They ain't gon' get me, got something fo' em
The devil up in yo' grill and you still don't even know em
Show 'em who's the OK
Like collard greens and Hoecakes, I got soul
That's something that you ain't got
That's why your style is rot–ten

Where nothing but pimps fully equipped quick to make a sale
Swell, swollen got my pockets, business booming like rockets

Time to drop these 'bows like Dusty Rhodes
Then I yell ""ho,"" and knock 'em up off they feet
Like a Southern hustler supposed to do

And all the niggas that was down since we been broke
Taking 'em deeper than a submarine
So scream when you hear the team of two
Look, my crew be thick as two fat hoes sitting off in a Brougham
I'm packing my tag backwards if you want to be acting wrong
Word is bond like super glue, it's funky like poopa scoop
And every word I say you can true

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Well, okey dokey, 'Kast out
I swear to God I got the highest booming Cadillac
The expialalistic Coupe de Ville, can you handle that, you rat?
I take my time cruising 'round the city malls
And under my seat for you suckers is your final curtain call
The one two to the gauge, P-U-M-P
You want to do a jack, I heat the barrel 'til it's empty, get me?
See, I ain't Finlay, getting in where I fit

Looking for hoes and snitches was my thing on Player's Ball, yup
So now I step, rather walk with the pimp limp
While my niggas are at East Point with that College Park hemp
Smoked out is how I wanna end it on this track
So I pass it to my partner and step back up in my Cadillac

Step up in my shoes, you crews sitting on Trues
And Vogues for the hoes only when we rolling through

That I'm glistening, rather gleaming

When it seems a bookburning's in perfect order -

Measured out, measured with

I could change the test results that I will get back

It’s too much to even try to explain
Your vibe is unstrained and times haven't changed
But time in arranged makes me feel like my mind is deranged
Your eyes are amazing
I see sanity it em’, do I sound nuts?
If so, let me start over from the ground up
Let’s act like no one is around us
We’re lucky to be lost like Vegas just found us
I don’t know if I’m reading the signs wrong
But I believe in what eyes can do if the vibe is strong
Reality bites like a python
And my heart is on the sleeve that I write on
I write with my right, so I hope you don’t think this is just a nice song
You might be wrong
I just wanna be your personal magician

Living life with…

Getting high with…

Just kissing my lips…

[Verse 2]
Chances are I’m jumpin’ the gun
I guess I’m predicting for somethin’ to come (Heh)
In my world your number is one
In your world my number is none
Cause you don’t know me yet
I’ve been watchin’, jottin’ notes on how I could approach
Don’t stop me though
From a distance, we locked eyes
I cannot lie; I got blind from the way your spotlight shines
Maybe then was not the right time
I don’t care; I went home to jot some tight lines
If we kiss, we rob the sky blind
Cause the stars wanna watch us, alright fine
I pour you a glass of wine, while I roll up a dime
I don’t know if you smoke, but I know that you fly
High, like you totin’ a lime, that’s green
I know that didn’t go over your mind

If you gave me your number
I won’t be so wild annoying and call ya
We would talk for a while, enjoying all the
Perks, we get from work
I oughta, confess
I’m intimidated cause you’re taller
But I want you in my company
And maybe it’s your height that humbles me
And maybe one night, sittin’ underneath the sunbeams
You will see that you should come with me
What the hell gon’ come between Y-O-U-A-N-D-M-E
I know you make believe in dreams
That someone could make you feel less empty
I ain’t a angel, but god sent me, to show you love constantly

Stone cold how I kill it, stone cold how I chill it
Stone cold with the midget, wrist spinning like a fidget
Chick banging like a Cillit, I don't even have a digit
On the 'Gram is how I pitch it, I go ham and then I switch it
I go ham in every single matter with the social ladder
You can't stop me flowing like a badder bladder
Got me spamming kappa, I'm way more than just a fucking rapper
I've embodied double dapper strappers
Saw me swinging winning I'm a proper scrapper
I'm too high to feel a low, I just buy whatever goes
I just want another rose, big booty in her clothes
Pussy popping when I close, dirty man like I'm SimiSimi
Horny rabbit, I'm like gimme gimme
Make commotion when I'm in my city
Dropping bag on bag while he shimmy shimmy
See me spending lavish in a boulevard
I don't credit, I just debit card
Tax man got me on their radar
But I pay my taxes so why the fuck

[Pre-Hook]
Are you bugging me and my day
Na, na, I don't deal with that
Paigons all in my way
Na, na, I don't deal with that
Bullshit in your DNA
Na, na, I don't deal with that
Bitches wanna come and play

[Hook]
'Cause everything is on point (On everything)
Creps are looking Gucci
Sharp is all I want until it suits me
Everything is on point
Show the 'Gram for how I'm living
Can't complain on how my people winning
Everything is on point (Skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt)
Yeah my GG looking glorious
If I die l'll know I'll die notorious
Everything is on point (Skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt)

I'm a Two Tone Rebel with my hand up to the sky
Got a 40 in my hand I pour some out for those who die
Grey suit pants, never on fire

I'm feeling good, I'm feeling I could kill a wolf dead
300 put me in that fucking wolf den
2 minutes come out with that fucking wolf head
And I ain't even tripping you should hear just what that wolf said
Liam Neeson when it comes to getting grey though
Fuck a formula, I signed a fucking [?]
Took a breath and now I'm backing, yeah I stand up
Never fall again, never tripping off a pair
Sick of running on ""E"", sick of running on empty
I fill my cup, it's never luck when you can put in the work
Bring the preacher to preach, shit I'll listen to stories
I find myself in different words but when I come back to Earth…

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
So come and see me about a beat
I charge by the snare, Air horns come free
Pocket full of dank, fuck saving that Keef
No Sosa, no guns, no murder, just peace

I'm feeling good, I'm feeling I could kill a wolf dead

I ain't no killer I just be with them
Fuck nigga better not push me
I ain't pussy leave you gushing
I once realized upon a time when I escaped demise
I possessed the heart of a lion
Looking homicide right down the eyes
Murder, blood money on my mind
Trapping selling dimes in a line of fire
Shootouts broad day on the 9
Swear I could rewind to those a thousand times
This the life I chose that's fine guess I'ma tote my iron
Through this lifestyle we still smile
See who got the rawest gat around the guys
Young niggas living and grew up wild
Walk up manistee just to see who down to ride
Remember niggas couldn't come outside
See clips straight through blocks down to 5
Yes same routine everytime riding round mask, 2 Glocks
No gloves hell nawl we ain't throwing no guns
These brand new Glocks, I might go to hell
When im smoking mary nigga im a young 2Pac
50 guns everybody clipped and ready
I dont even know who shot
Look like nowadays everybody stretching
Real in the life of Armageddon
Go and hold tight on my .357
Thinking am i still going to go to heaven
I know my granny there , lord let me in
Yeah you know that'll be a blessing
Send me with the demons all in hell scheming
It'll be just like I'm back on Essex
Iced out horns on my necklace
War where I'm from had to learn nothing less
Then a TEC gon to protect us

Looking down that barrel of that 40 caliber
You could see the ghost of Lucifer
Looking like he coming after ya
I done did the streets before feel like I'm on another chapter
But everytime I'm in my city
Mo blood get shed then West Africa
Murders like the boston massacre
Just another day with my savages
Ducking penitentiary chances went against
All them odds and averages
I was on the 8 block everyday posted up
Had my own lil .38 cocked
Me, Crazy James, J dot, CJ took ten, Weezy still on the 8 hot
W2FL had twitter going up hashtag when the tape drop
I was in the streets 24 nights down no love
Lil Herb, give a fuck if my face hot
What a nigga gone do to me, who is he no he ain't true as me
Murder on somebody nigga, If they ever shoot at me
And they say I ride like I'm bone thugs and harmony
When I start flowing with fluency
People asking me herbo how i remain humble
When niggas stay talking bout doing me
Focusing on the road, had to pull out some shows
A couple still talking bout sueing me
Young Pac in the flesh, Glock on my waist
Gold chain on top of my vest
Hit'em up and soon as i get around my ambitionz
As a rider yall know the rest
My ambition as a rider in a black S550
Flipping through Nevada
Do the strip like it dont matter
Anything for the cake fuck around and take yo batter
And I use to have dreams of being above the rim
On the court shooting hoops but instead I was posted on Essex
Me, Capo, and Lil Roc toted jocks with the juice

Still getting ID'd for Swishers (Mama still wash my clothes)
Still with the Save Money militia (I'ma still watch my bros)

Trust me guys, it's all under control
The judge is my uncle, he'll take the insanity plea
Oh yeah, don't forget my retainer balance
Okay, I understand you guys are pleading insanity claiming
Demonic spirits possessed you to do these hideous murders

Can you please explain to the court how these so called spirits made you into these raving madmen

[Verse 1: Shabazz the Disciple]
Bear witness as I exercise my exorcism
The evil that lurks within the sin, the terrorism
Possessed by evil spirits, voices from the dead
I come forth with Gravediggaz in a head full of dread
I've been examined ever since I was semen
They took a sonogram and seen the image of a demon
At birth nurses surrounded me with needles
And drugged me all up with the diseases of evil
Grew up in Hell, now I dwell in an Islamic temple
I’m fighting a holy war in the mental
Look deep into my eyes you'll see visions of death
Possessed by homicide is what I am obsessed
Giving niggas brain dimples
Dragging their asses on my hook by their temples
The cause of death is unknown to the cops
Cause when I kill 'em, I’m not leaving one element to autops'
First I'll assassinate him, and them I'll cremate him
Then take all of his fucking ashes and evaporate him
I'll creep through the graveyard and hunt down your tombstone
Dig up your skeleton and stomp all your fucking bones

The year '84, November, day 10
Overwhelmed by the wicked inspirations of an evil djinn
I realize my ideas have spawned for 400 years
Of blood sweat and tears
I saw the torture, brutal murder of my father
So my brain became stained with the horror
I'm having reoccurring nightmares
Of being soaking wet, strapped down to the electric chair
I got tackled with handcuffs and shackled in restraint
At the bottom of a holy tabernacle
They gave me nothing to eat for two weeks
And sewed my eye lids open so I couldn't sleep
About to die from thirst, that's when the minister
Quenched my jaws with a cold glass of vinegar
Upon my wounds they seasoned me with salt
And nailed my hands feet to the form of a cross
Ahh!! I cry
As the blood drips inside of my eye refusing to die
Visions of Hell tormented my faith
So I chewed my fucking arm off and made an escape

Let us please proceed with the defendants' explanation]

[Verse 3: Killah Priest]
Enter the realms of understanding
And take good heed or you could bleed while I’m scanning
Three stages of pure Hell, 16 pages of red cells
*Shh* rain drops hits the pails
Path is dull and narrow, you're stalked by a shadow
I'll pierce your skull with the fucking arrow
So narrow, only one could enter at a time
Stuck in the center, read the signs
A thousand doors to choose, you better hurry
Don’t stop, shit is getting hot as a pot of curry
On your right side there’s fire, your left, deep waters
Watch your step, it's deep waters
What's that coming through the floor? It's a claw
*pssh* took his fucking ass to the fucking core
(ahhh!!)

[Verse 4: Frukwan]
Stroll through the dark conditions
I stone you till I see sparks of friction
I chop ya like a coal miner
Then combine the drug and mix it with your blood
Some more, I give you some more and watch you crawl
Guts hit the floor, worms exit your pores
I trick ya, ha, then I'm quick to syringe
Deep into my thoughts and bust out your skin
You scream, portraits of inflictable pain, you can't stand
You're up to your hands in quicksand
You're sinking and sinking deep into the earth
Thoughts was possessed since the first day of birth
My mental says it's my turn to possess the matter
Stab you with a dagger up Jacob's ladder
Thoughts become shattered, confused and tragic

I'll take you for a ride
This steamy ol' wagon
The radio is getting wild
Baby Babe, we're moving so fast
I try to hang on
Try to hang on

Sleeping in my car, I will undress you
Sleeping in my car, I will caress you
Staying in the back seat of my car making love, oh yeah

Sleeping in my car, I will possess you
Sleeping in my car, certainly bless you
Laying in the back seat of my car making up

The night is so pretty and so young
The night is so pretty and so young, so very young

Sleeping in my car, I will undress you
Sleeping in my car, I will caress you
Staying in the back seat of my car making love to you

Sleeping in my car, I will possess you

207,Maybe Love Will Change Your Mind,"I'm beside myself...
Cause I don't know...and you won't tell
Your distant world has somehow pulled me in
It's so surreal...
So out of time with you it feels
To give again...
But you don't need a thing

Maybe love will change your mind
Maybe this time
Maybe love will change your mind
Maybe this time

A look...a touch
Just because I wanted them...
To mean so much...
You might not feel the same
The day would end...
And you'd go back to where you've been
A kiss for luck
I wish you could have stayed

Maybe love will change your mind
Maybe this time
Maybe love will make it clear
Oh, what words would keep you here
Maybe love will reach your heart
Thought I saw it in the dark
Maybe love will change your mind
Maybe this time

You want me to be there
You take me somewhere
You show me your lifeline
Reveal your other side
I would say but the words won't come
I just come undone
All I want to do...is to be closer to you

La la la...la la...La la la...la la

Maybe love will change your mind
Maybe this time
Maybe love will make it clear
Oh, what words would keep you here
Maybe love will reach your heart
Thought I saw it in the dark
Maybe love will change your mind
This time...Maybe love...
Maybe love...
Well you want me to be there with you
Well there's nothing more I'd rather do...",Stevie Nicks,1994,"[100, 84, 71, 62, 62, 57, 65, 69, 70, 79]",10

Enviyon on the mix
No, no, no, no
No-no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

[Chorus]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

[Verse]
You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

[Bridge]
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (Can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break (Were made outta plastic, fake)
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break again (I was tangled up in your drastic ways)
(Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?)

[Chorus]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one

It's like this
I'm that guy, you're so fly
Gotta get a piece of that sweet potato pie
I'm that guy, you're so fly
Gotta get a piece of that sweet potato pie

[Verse 1]
Now the way of today with the homies is straight
Gettin' fucked up off the dank, chronic
Bud, what, ever you wanna call it
And peace to you fuckin' alcoholics, for
Makin' the proper remedy
Cuz when I hit it, bitches envy me
Say you want wine? Yeah, I guess that's fine
But thai is the sky when you talkin' about mines
Now my thai got a friend named Gin
Got me all straight now my dick won't bend
Now I'm fucked for the rest of the night
Unless I find a piece of ass whether it's loose or tight
Now looka here looka here I done found a bitch
Yummy for the dick, Jelly mix in the switch
Save that shit cuz I don't wanna be your man
Just need a little loosin', do you understand?

[Hook (x2)]
My mind's fucked up off chocolate thai
Hit the gin shop now I'm so high
Now I need a bitch that's proper and fly
So break me off a piece of that sweet potato pie

[Verse 2]
Thinkin' about what I'm gonna do today
Party at my homies bout eight
I thought about goin' to the movies
But ain't nothin' like a bunch of proper ass hoochies
Dressed like a player can't wear nothin' less
Some simple ass shit, even if it ain't Guess
Take  a couple of shots and now I roll to the spot
Bitches straight peepin' wanna know what I got, well
One, two, three, Here comes the D
Pass me the buddah, OOOOH WEEE!!!!
And now I'm ready for you bitches
So gang a dick licker, do you get the picture?
And so much love for ya gals
And peace, love, and pussy to my muthafuckin' pals
And ay, yai, yai, I'mma stay high
And keep me a piece of that sweet potato pie

[Hook (x2)]

[Verse 3]
The fellas wanna have a barbecue tonight, I think it's on about five
They say it's gonna have plenty Daisy Dukes, and Les says it's gonna be live
So Imma gonna grab me a player suit, cuz ain't a damn thing changed
And now I'm proper and fly and shit, but man do I feel strange
So Imma go down to the liquor store, and find my friend named Gin
And go to the girl with the flyest thai, and break her off a proper twin
And now it's time to make some shit, and look for the proper mix
And run a little game on the PYT, and tell it to her somethin' like this

210,Tell Me Where It Hurts,"[Verse 1]
What is my day going to look like?
What will my tomorrow bring me?
If I had x-ray eyes, I could see inside
I wouldn't have to predict the future

I wish that you would do with some talking
How else am I to know what you're thinking?
If only people would say what it really was
What it really was
What it really was that they wanted

[Chorus]
Tell me where it hurts
To hell with everybody else
All I care about is you and that's the truth
They don't love me, I can tell
But you do, so they can go to hell

[Verse 2]
Did they ever give you a reason
To believe in something different
If you're looking for love, for what it's worth
I have plenty of it lying around here somewhere

If you are looking for disappointment
You can find it around any corner
In the middle of the night I hold on to you tight
So both of us can feel protected

[Chorus]
Tell me where it hurts
To hell with everybody else
All I care about is you and that's the truth
They don't love me, I can tell
But you do, so they can go to hell

[Bridge]
I've been loved but I didn't know how to feel it
And I've been adored but I don't know if I ever believed it
I've been loved my whole life but I didn't know how to take it
Until you

[Chorus 2]
So tell me where it hurts
To hell with everybody else
All I care about is you and that's the truth
They don't like me, yeah I can tell
But you do, so they can go to hell
But you do, so they can go to hell

I take a deep breath every time I pass your door
I know you're there but I can't see you anymore
And that's the reason you're in the dark

And I feel so helpless here
Watch my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again

Watch my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again

Gotta say it again now
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
He's a mighty mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Yes he is
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Yeah

[Verse 1: Salt]
I wanna take a minute or two, and give much respect due
To the man that's made a difference in my world
And although most men are ho's he flows on the down low
'Cause I never heard about him with another girl
But I don't sweat it because it's just pathetic
To let it get me involved in that he said/she said crowd
I know that ain't nobody perfect, I give props to those who deserve it
And believe me y'all, he's worth it
So here's to the future cuz we got through the past
I finally found somebody that can make me laugh
(Ha ha ha) You so crazy
I think I wanna have your baby

[Chorus: En Vogue]
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Yes, he is
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man

He's a  mighty mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
You gotta say it again now
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Heeh

[Verse 2: Pepa]
My man is smooth like Barry, and his voice got bass
A body like Arnold with a Denzel face
He's smart like a doctor with a real good rep
And when he comes home he's relaxed with Pep
He always got a gift for me everytime I see him
A lot of snot-nosed ex-flames couldn't be him
He never ran a corny line once to me yet
So I give him stuff that he'll never forget
He keeps me on Cloud Nine just like the Temps
He's not a fake wannabe tryin' to be a pimp
He dresses like a dapper don, but even in jeans
He's a God-sent original, the man of my dreams

[Verse 3: Spinderella]
Yes, my man says he loves me, never says he loves me not
Tryin' to rush me good and touch me in the right spot
See other guys that I've had, they tried to play all that mac (shit)
But every time they tried I said, ""That's not it""
But not this man, he's got the right potion
Baby, rub it down and make it smooth like lotion
Yeah, the ritual, highway to heaven
From seven to seven he's got me open like Seven Eleven
And yes, it's me that he's always choosin'
With him I'm never losin', and he knows that my name is not Susan
He always has heavy conversation for the mind
Which means a lot to me cuz good men are hard to find

[Chorus: En Vogue]
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
He's a  mighty mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Say it again now
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Ohh, uuuh
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
I said what a mighty good man
You know what I'm sayin', he's a mighty mighty good man
Y'all hear me, now check it out

[Verse 4: Salt]
My man gives real loving that's why I call him Killer
He's not a wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am, he's a thriller
He takes his time and does everything right
Knocks me out with one shot for the rest of the night
He's a real smooth brother, never in a rush
And he gives me goose pimples with every single touch
Spends quality time with his kids when he can
Secure in his manhood cuz he's a real man
A lover and a fighter and he'll knock a knucker out
Don't take him for a sucker cuz that's not what he's about
Every time I need him, he always got my back
Never disrespectful cuz his mama taught him that
I've got a good man

[Chorus: En Vogue]
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
A mighty mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man

If you have something to say, you should say it right now

You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it

If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)

[Verse 2]
I know you said to me
This is exactly how it should feel when it's meant to be
Time is only wasting, so why wait for eventually?
If we gonna do something about it, we should do it right now

You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it

If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?

If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)

Why give up before we try?
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings before we fly away (Fly away)

Won't you come be in the sky with me?

Got me waiting, anticipating
You got me thinking
I want your love
I'm trying to show you
I really, really want to know you
You got me thinking
I want your love

[Verse 1]
I got a funny feeling, honey
That you're kind of digging me
But every time you see me
Word is born, you be ignoring me

I know your name, yes, I do
Because your girls told me
I know where you live, you want to bet
Because your girls showed me

But I'll parlay
And stay out of your way
Figuring I won't be ignorant
And catch you the next day

When I'm in focus, I notice you
Only move with a chosen few
Irreplaceable, what's up
With insatiable you

I never figured you
For the quiet type
On the down low
The low pro-file type

I always thought you
Was a rah-rah mama
Stirring up crazy confusion
Causing drama

What's the matter, huh
Cat got your tongue
Or some mack got you strung
Or maybe I ain't the one

I want to know cause if I don't
It's going to haunt me
Yo, word up
You got me thinking you want me

[Hook]
Got me waiting, anticipating
You got me thinking
I want your love
I'm trying to show you
I really, really want to know you
You got me thinking
I want your love

[Verse 2]
I'm steady, picking my brain
Trying to figure your game
What's your angle, tell me
Where you're coming from

The whole picture is strange
So I'm digging the frame
Because I like what I see
And I want some

So tell me what's your plot
What's your plan
You're looking for
A brother to get got?
I'm not your man

But believe in me
You want to be with me
But you won't even talk to me
To tell me what it is you see in me

I gotta hear it from your girls, Uptown
The word got around from my crew
In Brooklyn and in the Boogie Down
Said you had a thing for me
And what would it take for a date
And wait, swing with me

I got your cards
You're playing hard to get
I'm long and I'm strong
And if it's on
I keep it soft and wet

Let me know cause if you don't
It's going to haunt me
Yo, word up, you got me
Thinking you want me

[Hook]
Got me waiting, anticipating
You got me thinking
I want your love
I'm trying to show you
I really, really want to know you
You got me thinking
I want your love

""Hey, yo, hey, yo....""
Look at all the cuties
Swinging in the party
""Hey, yo, hey, yo....""
Look at all the cuties
Swinging in the party

[Verse 3]
I never stumble cause I'm humble
And I'm ready to rap
You got me feeling like I'm sleeping
And it's keeping me trapped

But still in all, you want to stroll
And have a fella on layaway
Fronting for nothing like it's
Something for me to stay away

Emotional trips
Get a grip
Because I'm losing it
Ideas were clear
Had it in gear
Now you're confusing it

I had the thought
That you were caught
And you were going steady
Wasn't checking for me
Cause you had a friend already

But I'mma put it all aside
Cause God is my guide
Swallow my pride, stride
And follow my guide

Let me know cause if you don't
It's going to haunt me
Yo, word up, you got me
Thinking you want me

[Verse 1:]
Just when I thought could I hit another one
So up jumps see me with the pumps and a bump
All stiggitty stiggity curves, getting on my good nerves
Looking like ice cream ready to be served
Stretch, bend it, can I get in it
If you wanna kick it with a G baby here's me
Cause I come equipped, I'm a pimp
Slippity slip, out your clothes and take a trip

[Verse 2:]
Pumps and a bump, now many say a big butt
But if you're hip you know that it's a phone crud
It's making the brothers go crazy in the 2-G
Shake like a bottle girl fine as wine G
So when I here I got a step (to a fine thing)
Never been a coward (cause it's a eastside thing)
Just step right up to the girl with the big butt
Tell her what's up you got the pumps and a bump

[Bridge:]
Men: All that we want
For the rest of our life
Is a girl thick and tight
(Ladies!)
Women:All that we want
Is man who is right
Who can hit it all night!

Now when you see the rump shaking on the dance floor
You following with your eyes and get hypnotized
But a fella like me will dance up to some chopping and chewing
Keep em bottling you know I keep 'em bobbing
I put my fingerprints all over that rump
I'm guilty as hell but I love the pumps and the bump! (Ow!)

I was playing it too safe
Playing it too safe is dangerous
All the things that kept me going
Was all the things that slowed me down
I see the writing on the wall

I thought it was here, but it's not my fault
You said it was there, but it's not over there
Oh, fuck yeah
It's gonna be somewhere you'll see

[Chorus]
I don't wanna know
Guess we could make up stuff to talk about
Woah oh oh oh oh oh

I wanna put you in my crocodile mouth
And drag you to the bottom of my swamp
Oh, fuck yeah

I don't really know where I'm going
Not sure that I wanna be knowing

People who do not do anything know
Exactly where all their time is going
Oh, fuck yeah
Gonna be— happier maybe

People in the wrong bodies, mountain broken like a heart
Drive a highway through you like a rainbow arc

220,"Crooklyn (From ""Crooklyn"")","[Intro: Special Ed]
Yeah, we represent
Church Ave., Nostrand Ave. in the house, Flatbush Ave
My brothers in Bed-Stuy, Throop Ave., word up
Fort Green, Crooklyn, yeah

[Scratched Hook]
""Straight from Crooklyn, better known as Brooklyn""
""Never taking shorts 'cause Brooklyn's the borough""

[Verse 1: Special Ed]
Panic as another manic depressant
Adolescent stares at death
Now what's left when there ain't no guide
And a whole lot of pride?
It might be a homicide, so let the drama... slide
We don't want no problems, B
Get your name in the obituary column sheet
'Cause life is too short and it just gets shorter
I wish I had a quarter for all my people they slaughter
Last year alone, in the dead zone
Walk straight, but don't walk late
‘Cause I'm coming with a hate only made from what it made me
‘Cause nobody ever played me
Now it's only getting worse
Buckshot and Ace in the land of the waste, kicking you in your face

[Verse 2: Masta Ace]
We be doing it up Crooklyn style
What does it take to get you wild?
My mentality is getting iller, killer
Instinct is trying to infiltrate, but wait
I know you wanna enter but I can't let you in
My mind state's the maddest, I'm gone with the wind
Because it is survival of the fittest
When the shit hits the fan, I got my shank in my hand
Black man with the permanent tan
I come from the 'Ville and never ran
Damn!

[Verse 3: Buckshot]
I'm feeling another part of reality
Hit me when I represent the F.A.P
Straight from the 'Ville, Tilden played the building
I mean literally when I say, “I’ll make a killing""
For my cipher, see, I'm fitna bust a piper
Original heads represent the Brooklyn all-nighter
Do or die, I'm saying, “It's you and I”
Bring your click, so we can get Stone like Family Sly
Peace to C.I. and the Bush
Mighty Mateen, Ruck and the Rock giving a push

[Scratched Hook] (2X)
""Straight from Crooklyn, better known as Brooklyn""
""Never taking shorts 'cause Brooklyn's the borough""

[Verse 4: Masta Ace]
We did it like that and now we do it like this
We did it like that and now we do it like this
Go inside your mind and find a time that you miss
And just think about the steel in your fist
It's just an extension of your arm
It's that ghetto type of charm that makes all the homeboys swarm
Can I drop the bomb? Oh, yes, I can
Move with the groove, smooth like Geechie Dan
Who is the man? That kid there
Who is the chick with the pick in her hair?
Angela, uhh, Davis, and we roll like Avis
Rent-a-Car—kid, there you are

[Verse 5: Special Ed]
You know where to find me whenever you need me
If you know the Ave., follow the path
To the land of the aftermath, but don't frolic in the midst
Crazy-ass Crooklyn kids
‘Cause they’re always throwing a body on my lawn
I'm getting a Rottweiler without a collar
Get off my block, boy, and give me a dollar
For the trouble or get blown up like a bubble

[Verse 6: Buckshot]
Now let's take a sec to think back
To the year of the seven-O, when Brooklyn was the place to go
Flow on a journey up to Crown Heights
Ebbets Field; feel the real-to-real on your life
Trife individuals live in the PJ's
Dee Evil, check my DJ
Hey, play, what I wanna play in the day
But in the night, I feel the right took the left
Bucktown, Brooklyn, break it down
Heads from state to state, travel as I unravel the rate
Howard, Tapscott, and Sutter
I remember way back in the days playing Hot Peas and Butter
Brother, if you want another lesson, Crooklyn session
Take it back, ""Black Smif-N-Wessun""

[Verse 7: Special Ed]
Press your luck, you’ll get stuck by Buck, for your bucks
Masta Ace has the taste for ducks and duck sauce
So tell Lord Digga
“Dig a grave for the bones, sticks and stones”
While I kick some ancient poems through your domes
Act went back to attack your homes
So, Tip, can I flip?  (Yes, you can)
I'm in a World War with Muhammad, my man

[Verse 8: Masta Ace]
Feels so good to be a Crooklyn Dodger
Uh huh, What’s Happening!! to ReRun and Roger?
I think I seen em wearing Timberlands and running down the block
From Dwayne and Dwayne had a Glock
‘Cause he be selling rock for the Partridge Family
And Reuben Kincaid drives a 300-E
And he be pimping Chrissy from Three's Company
Plus he stuck Mr. T for all his jewelry
This is a 70's thing from the days
When kids didn't act so crazed in Crooklyn

Knowin’ that I'm dead wrong, that I gotta call her (Brrt)
Drippin' in the fur, got the Bentley, we can swerve
And the mansion super big, everything his and hers
She don't kick it with the birds, and the iced out Patek on her wrist
It got her lookin' like she wanna go and surf (Ice)
But from the gate I ain't blowin' out the cake
We been goin' eight rounds straight, now we out of shape
Smokin’ while I contemplate, I’m thinkin' ’bout the better days
When me and you, we met each other, it would never be the same (never)
Them material things, I don't care about the fame (Nah)
I miss you so much that I went and tatted your name (Tatted)
Let me be your drug, tell me when you feel in pain (Where)
And you can be my stripper baby, no I ain't ashamed
Thinkin' ’bout when I hit her, no precision, I got aim
Double R, we pullin' up and watch the Rolls all lanes
I need you in my life, I promise that I'll make it right
And by the end of the night I bet your mind gon' change (Wait)
It ain't 'bout the cars, it ain't all 'bout the chains
Lookin' up, up at the stars, take a look what I became (Look at me)
What you want, a Range? What you want, a pinky ring?
I can get you what you name but love don't cost a thing (Cost a thing)

Tears will fall like petals when we part

I begged you to be different
But you'll always be untrue

Now there's nothing left to do

So I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses
One for every time you broke my heart

You made our lover's lane a road of sorrow
Till at last we have to say goodbye
You're leaving me to face each new tomorrow

The plantation deep down inside of me
Everybody fuck like sodomy
'Cause one or the other what it gotta be
Tell me why my momma gotta lie to me
Unity for everyone that lied to me
Peace on Earth what I try to be
I just wanna spread the message of equality
And yes, I got to gift to gab fo sho
Will I have to get the gat? No, no
Yes, I got to gift to gab fo sho
But will have to get the gat, get the gat, get the, get the gat?

[Chorus]
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first black man
Long ago before the white man
Could paint the black man with a gun in his hand
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first white man
At the very moment when they looked around and said
""Fuck it, I’ma steal this land""
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way way back to the first black man
Long ago before the white man
Could paint the black man with a gun in his hand
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way way back to the first white man
At the very moment when they looked around and said
""Fuck it, I’ma steal this land""

[Outro]
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to about 1990
Shady Grove Hospital in Rockville, Maryland
7:36 a.m., where a biracial baby was born
To a black father and a white mother
Father that wasn’t there
Addicted to crack cocaine, alcohol, and various other drugs
Same as his mom
(Way, way back)
So I’m gonna tell you about that, right?
And I’m gonna tell you about how
All this young boy ever wanted was happiness
All he ever wanted was positivity
All he ever wanted to do was entertain
And this boy went through hell
You gotta understand, his mother was racist, which is crazy
'Cause how in the fuck is you gonna have
All these black babies with black men but you racist
Like bitch, that don’t make no sense, but it is what it is
You know, he grew up, her callin' him a nigger
The kids at school callin' him a cracker
Identifying as black, looking as white
Being told what you can or can’t be
This kid went through everything
He went through...
He saw narcotics in the household
Violence, murderers, drug dealers, he was kidnapped
There was crazy shit that happened to this kid
And he persevered while the whole world said
What they said?
Said you wouldn’t be shit!
You ain’t gon' be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothing
And I, and he, he said fuck that, I’ma persevere
And that’s why the message is always peace, love and positivity
See, he always saw things from two sides
He always saw things from two sides
He always knew that the message
Everybody was born equal
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
He knew that because he saw that
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way)
Because he was stripped and torn down
By his black brothers and sisters that were uneducated
And that did not know
And he was stripped and he was torn down
By his white side that did not know
These people that are ignorant
That cannot see the bigger picture
That must fight and kill and murder each other
But once again, all he ever wanted to do
Was spread a message of equality
For every man, woman, and child
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first)
Now imagine this child growing up
And seeing the craziest shit
Being a part of the craziest shit
Running around with the wrong people
Running around with guns and knives
And fighting and stealing and, and all this
Because he didn’t know, he didn’t know!
But he knew deep down in his heart that it wasn’t right
And he knew that he needed to get away from it
Now I want you to also imagine, that at 17 years old
This child, okay, leaves home and gets two jobs to support himself
Two jobs that he works in the morning and the evenings
And then he would then come home
To about eight or nine hours of sleep
But spend four, five, six hours of that
Working on music, persevering
Grabbing the remote control and looking in the mirror
And pretending to see thousands and thousands and thousands of people
Just chanting his name
Hoping that it would happen
But the, but the, but the world said no!
Mothafucka, little mothafucka no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no
Ya nigga, ya cracka, ya white boy, ya black mothafucka
No-no!
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first)
And he said fuck that
He said peace, love, and positivity
He said equality for all man
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation, yeah
Now I want you to also imagine
People telling him that he did not live this life
“You just a white boy
You ain’t never experienced that shit
You from Gaithersburg, Maryland, nothing happens there
Oh no, no, we know, we weren’t there
We didn’t live with you, we didn't live in your Section 8 household
We didn’t live with the narcotics and violence in your household
We just saw it from the outside, outside, outside, outside
Outside, outside, outside, outside
And since you white, you gotta have money, right?”
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first black man)
And this young man persevered in spite
Of what people told him he was, wasn’t, and would never be
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first black)
And that man is here today, proud
A lover of all human beings
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, sexual orientation, yeah, yeah
And he’s here to say:
Even though we’re all born and created equal
We are not treated equally
There’s extremists on every side
And you should just do your best to live life
And let other people believe whatever they wanna believe
As long as they’re not hurtin' anybody
You can believe they’re going to hell
You can believe it’s not right
You can believe you’re superior, fine
Just stop killing each other",Logic,1994,"[97, 92, 83, 77, 73, 82, 90]",7
228,I Wish,"[Intro]
Hey, this is radio station WSKEE
We're taking calls on the wish line
Making your wacky wishes come true
Hello?

[Hook]
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala

[Verse 1]
I wish I was like six-foot-nine so I can get with Leoshi
'Cause she don't know me but, yo, she's really fine
You know I see her all the time, everywhere I go
And even in my dreams, I can scheme of ways to make her mine
'Cause I know she's livin' phat
Her boyfriend's tall and he plays ball, so how am I gonna compete with that?
'Cause when it comes to playing basketball
I'm always last to be picked and in some cases never picked at all
So I just lean up on the wall
Or sit up in the bleachers with the rest of the girls who came to watch their man ball
Dag y'all! I never understood, black
Why the jocks get the fly girls, and me, I get the hood rats
I tell 'em, ""Scat, skittle, scabobble""
Got hit with a bottle and put in a hospital for talkin' that mess
I confess, it's a shame
When you livin' in a city that's the size of a box and nobody knows yo' name
Glad I came, to my senses
Like quick-quick, got sick-sick to my stomach, overcometh by thoughts
Of me and her together, right?
So when I asked her out, she said I wasn't her type

[Hook]
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala

[Verse 2]
I wish I had a brand new car so far, I got this hatchback
And everywhere I go, yo, I gets laughed at
And when I'm in my car I'm laid back
I got an 8-track, and a spare tire in the backseat, but that's flat
And do you really wanna know what's really wack?
See, I can't even get a date, so what do you think of that?
I heard that prom night is a bomb night
With a hood rat t'you can hold tight
But really though, I'm Figaro
When in my car, I can't even get a hello
Well, so many people wanna cruise Crenshaw on Sunday
One day I'mma have to get in my car and go
You know I take the 110 until the 105
Get off at Crenshaw, tell my homies, ""Look alive""
'Cause it's hard to survive
When you're living in a concrete jungle and these girls keep passing me by
She looks fly, she looks fly
Make me say, ""my, my, my""

[Hook]
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala

[Bridge]
I wish I was a little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I was a little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I was a little bit taller, y'all
I wish I was a baller
I wish I was a little bit taller
I wish I was a baller

[Verse 3]
Hey, I wish I had my way
'Cause every day would be a Friday, and you could even speed on the highway
I would play ghetto games
Name my kids ghetto names: Little Mookie, Big Al, Lorraine
Yo, you know that's on the real
So if you're down on your luck then you should know just how I feel
'Cause if you don't want me around
See, I go simple, I go easy, I go Greyhound
Hey, you, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down
Ah, yes, ain't that fresh?
Everybody wants to get down like that

[Chorus]
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala

Yo, bro, I'm half Indian, so you're right
I'mma about to show you wit my mic sword
Yo Shaolin sling, come on raise the sword
Charge, they all crowd from the Black Fist
I got fudge in my mouth, they say that'll let your own wrist
M.C.'s fall and they can't get up
I do the rap, why, yes that's a cut
Huh, right back at you, niggas better run
Or feel the force of the Hell Razah's gun
Gupao, gupao, my style is wild chopped in the Shao'
Zoo, aow, aow, I can flip it acapello
I'll make you jelly like Jell-O, figaro, figaro
Who would think that the Just would go opera
You could ask Hammer, he know my shit is popper
Stopper, stopper, like Cuddy Ranks
I'm takin money to bank, and my moms I like I'd like to thank
Shaolin, Black Fist, they do the job
And Just came back wit that ol' funky rhyme

Yo the hair, got Tical, got a nigga open

They couldn't catch my style if I was a baseball
Bases loaded, and I got my back gun
Blaow, boom, bang, oh shit a home run

Bring it, if you want, cuz you really don't amaze me

[Hook]

[King Just]
Look who's back, it's the Hell Razah, raisin hell

My slang can bang, so I guess I be the man
You couldn't hang wit my style, if you invented the Ku Klux Klan
I'm like AT&T, I'mma reach ya through ya speaker
I got more sole than a sneaker
Asylum, I'm crazy, I guess I'm wildin
My stylin, is the record straight from the Shaolin
By the kiss of the Black Fist
Shit is sick, here to make ya wanna drown a fish
Under water, I'mma slaughter, like a change machine wit no quarter
Out of order, run for the border
The hardcore rap act is back
I stick out like a thumbtack, I wipe niggas off the map
And I rhyme to get paid, cuz when I raid
I wouldn't wanna hear ya style wit a hearing aid
Straight up crook, meaner than Captain Hook
Look out, look out, stomp like Bigfoot
And I don't give a fuck about a girl
My crew is more crazy than Bebe Kids in fuckin Fun World
I'm causin niggas doom, I mean sonic boom
I'm fuckin stupid, I write rhymes in the boiler room
Like Krugger, funky dope maneuver
The Drunken Monk is so funky, they call me manure
Horse shit, I flip shit, oh my God, I rip shit
I talk shit, no one can shit, like I shit
Shit like this, get you upset
Because the shit that I was singin, was pumpin through ya projects
How much types must I say shit?

If your whole world is shakin'
And you feel like I do
That's just love sneakin' up on you

Nowhere on earth for your heart to hide
Once love comes sneaking up on your blind side

And they take a loss, take a loss to the Master and I
Throws crazy blows and they knows I be plastering
All across the room on the ceilings and the walls too
Punk little suckers didn't know I had the gall to
Come around they block with my cock-diesel system and
Turn it up to 10 and then start to diss them and
They didn't wanna battle if they did when they saw me
They'd a opened up they trunk but they try to ignore me
Hey little suckers I know you hear me callin you
Thought you wanted some but I see that you all into
Frontin ain't no future in your frontin so let's get it on
Like Marvin Gaye,(hey) take the cash and sit it on
The hood of ya wick-wack low-ridin Cadillac
Back up ya boys and let's start the battle

Check it out baby, check it out y'all
I was born to roll (repeat several)

Drivin down the block like what else should a brother do
It's Saturday, it's Saturday, the heat might smother you
Rolling down my windows yeah I have a air-conditioner
But I got the sound I want the whole world to listen to
Waitin at a red light, Kentucky Fried Chicken in
Low End Theory tape in, bass crazy kicking in
See this Puerto Rican Latin Chico Rico Suave
In a red Corolla eh yo does he wanna play?
Pullin up beside me, looking like he want it
Show me what you got then watch me get up on it
Holding up traffic but we can't hear they horns
Cause he got musica grande yeah he got it goin on
But I think I better school him cause he don't know the time
So I'm turnin up the boom cause he cannot mess with mine
Brothers hear me hitting from like 50 blocks away I
Wanna turn they heads so you know I gotta play
High decibels passing through a residential district
See a few cuties and I turn it up like Bisquick
Mira, mira man don't sleep, I got tha, I got tha, I got the woofers in my Jeep

Black boy, black boy turn that shit down
You know that America don't wanna hear the sound
Of the bass drum jungle music go back to Africa
Nigga I'll arrest you if you holding up trafffic
I'll be damned if I listen, so cops save your breath and
Write another ticket if ya have any left and
I'm breaking ear drums while I'm breaking the law
I'm disturbing all the peace cause Sister Souljah said war
So catch me if ya can, if you can here's a donut
Cause once you drive away, yo ya know I'm gonna go nuts
And turn it up to where it was before nice try
But ya can't stop the power of the bass in ya eye
I wonder if I blasted a little Elvis Presley
Would they pull me over and attempt to arrest me
I really doubt doubt it, they probably start dancing
Jumpin on my tip and pissing in they pants and
Wiggling and jiggling and grabbing on they pelvis
But you know my name so you never hear no Elvis

235,Objects In The Rear View Mirror May Appear Closer Than...,"[Verse 1]
The skies were pure and the fields were green
And the sun was brighter than it's ever been
When I grew up with my best friend, Kenny
We were close as any brothers that you ever knew

It was always summer and the future called
We were ready for adventures and we wanted them all
And there was so much left to dream
And so much time to make it real

But I can still recall the sting of all the tears when he was gone
They say he crashed and burned, I know I'll never learn
Why any boy should die so young

We were racing; we were soldiers of fortune
We got in trouble but we sure got around
There are times I think I see him peeling out of the dark
I think he's right behind me now, and he's gaining ground

But it was long ago, and it was far away
Oh God, it seems so very far
And if life is just a highway, then the soul is just a car

[Hook (X2)]
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are

[Verse 2]
And when the sun descended and the night arose
I heard my father cursing everyone he knows
He was dangerous and drunk and defeated
And corroded by failure and envy and hate

There were endless winters and the dreams would freeze
Nowhere to hide and no leaves on the trees
And my father's eyes were blank
As he hit me again and again and again

I know I still believe he'd never let me leave
I had to run away alone
So many threats and fears, so many wasted years
Before my life became my own

And though the nightmares should be over
Some of the terrors are still intact
I'll hear that ugly, coarse, and violent voice
And then he grabs me from behind, and then he pulls me back

But it was long ago, and it was far away
Oh God, it seems so very far
And if life is just a highway, then the soul is just a car

And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are

[Instrumental solo]

[Verse 3]
There was a beauty living on the edge of town
She always put the top up and the hammer down
And she taught me everything I'll ever know
About the mystery and the muscle of love

The stars would glimmer and the moon would glow
I'm in the back seat with my Julie like Romeo
And the signs along the highway all said
""Caution! Kids at play!""

Those were the rites of spring and we did everything;
There was salvation every night
We got our dreams reborn and our upholstery torn
But everything we tried was right

She used her body just like a bandage
She use my body just like a wound
I'll probably never know where she disappeared
But I can see rising up out of the back seat now
Just like an angel rising out of a tomb

But it was long ago, and it was far away
Oh God, it seems so very far
And if life is just a highway, then the soul is just a car

[X9]
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are

[Outro]
She used her body just like a bandage
She used my body just like a wound

236,Whenever You Come Around,"The face of an angel, pretty eyes that shine
I lie awake at night wishing you were mine
I'm standing here holding the biggest heartache in town
Whenever you come around

[Chorus:]
I get weak in the knees, and I lose my breath
Oh I try to speak but the words won't come
I'm so scared to death
And when you smile that smile
The world turns upside down
Whenever you come around

I feel so helpless, I feel just like a kid
What is it about you that makes me keep my feelings hid
I wish I could tell you, but the words can't be found
Whenever you come around

[Chorus]
I get weak in the knees, and I lose my breath
Oh I try to speak but the words won't come
I'm so scared to death
And when you smile that smile
The world turns upside down
Whenever you come around

I get weak in the knees, and I lose my breath
Oh I try to speak but the words won't come
I'm so scared to death
And when you smile theat smile
The world turns upside down
Whenever you come around

And when you smile that smile

238,And Our Feelings,"[Verse 1]
We fell in love
And who could blame us
The word was we were just beside ourselves
And everybody said it wouldn't last
And now they wonder
Why we didn't last

We fell in love
It seemed so righteous
Couldn't compare our love to no one else
And everybody thought we could not win
It's no wonder
Love came to an end

[Chorus]
And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words that come from whispers
From people we don't know
And our feelings, yeah
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words without emotion
From people who don't know
Who don't know...

[Verse 2]
We fell apart
The bond was broken
Should've kept our thoughts between ourselves
And though they say they cared
They didn't help
Makes me wonder
Should we blame ourselves?

So here we are
Broken hearted
What in the world have we done to ourselves?
When everybody says to let it end, baby
Well, it makes me wonder
We can't let them win

[Chorus]
And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words that come from whispers
From people we don't know
And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words without emotion
From people who don't know

[Bridge]
If we'd only just try, we could make it by
And maybe in time we could make it right
If we only had done what we shoulda done
We'd both be here still making love
I wanna know that, that we can go back
Back to the times when the lovin' was all that
When no one could come between our love

[Chorus]
And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words that come from whispers
From people we don't know
And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words without emotion

Make a bad one good make a wrong one right
Power of love that keeps you home at night

That's the power of love

Next time you feel it, it might make you mad
But you'll be glad baby when you've found

It's just the night in my veins
Oh, making me crawl in the dust again
It's just the night under my skin
Slipping it in

He's got his hands in my hair
And his lips everywhere
Oh yeah, it feels good, it's all right
Even if it's just the night in my veins

He's got me up against the back of a pick-up truck
Out of sight of the neon and glare
We might as well be on a beach under the moonlight
Love's language reads the same anywhere, yeah

It's just the night in my veins
Oh, making me crawl in the dust again
It's just the night under my skin
Slipping it in

He's got his chest on my back
Across a new Cadillac
Oh yeah, it feels good, it's all right
Even if it's just the night in my veins
Even if it's just the night in my veins, oh

I've got my head on the curb
And I can't produce a word
Oh yeah, it feels good, it's all right
Even if it's just the night in my veins
It feels good, it's all right
Even if it's just the night in my veins
Even if it's just the night in my veins

It feels good, it's all right

Reminisce about the times, the memory's I find

We're so full energy, made my room so bright (so bright)

[Outro letter for his dog]
And on that terrible night, when you had collapsed outside
I brought you into my room, and i called your name
And you woke up, i was so relieved
But still so worried and scared
I left to make one call
But when I came back you were no longer here
I screamed you're name, Again, And again
But there was no response, just a silence in the air
That's when i realized you had left
You crossed a bridge to the other side
And I regret that I wasn't there for you
For you last moment on this earth
And I wish I could of had more time
But i took you for granted
And if somehow you can hear me
Just know that i'm so sorry
And i was so fucking broken without you
And it fucking breaks my heart
To know that it's been a whole year without you
But i'll never forget you, and I know one day we'll meet again
You weren't just a dog to me
You were my best friend

Centurions to seek him out

Centurions! There go the centurions

Brutus had to turn his head
When THIS cat done went and said
""If he's got this thing for shoes
He just might be ambitious, too
They got holidays all in his name
And all a tyrant needs is fame
Those fascists don't play pretty games

But Rome is a democracy

""Paps sag was bist du für ein Spinner lass die Finger mal vom Schnaps""
Ich würd sagen: ""Ja das mach ich, aber saufe noch heute
Diese letzte Flasche aus und dann lass ich das euch zu liebe
Heute wach ich auf mit einem Kater und hab nix
Alles geträumt keine Freundin bin kein Vater keine Kids
Ist das bitter, für mich nicht denn der Geschmack ist mir nicht fremd
Ich hab ne Disko im Gesicht und eine Nacht lang nicht gepennt
Und da denk ich drüber nach ob ich versagt habe als Mensch
Hat man mir als ich zur Welt kam gleich die Arschkarte geschenkt
Muss ich abwarten bis endlich was geschieht was mich lächeln lässt
Guck ständig auf mein Handy und hoff Melli schrieb ne SMS
Hat sie Gott sei Dank gemacht und ich gelacht was für ein Glück
Hab mich achzig mal verdrückt aber Schatz ich schrieb zurück
Weißte man verliebt sich nicht mal so in einen Promi
Das ist alles Illusion, wie ein rosarotes Pony

Ich kann selbst nach sechzehn Becks noch gerade ausgehen
Und ich schiele nicht, Ich lalle zwar doch lass mich schnell mal ausreden ich liebe dich
Im nächsten Leben werd ich saufen aufgeben, in diesem nicht, äh in diesem nicht
Liebling ich geh drauf auch wenn ich weg bin bitte glaube ich denk im Himmel an die Frau mit braunem Fleck im linken Auge
Ich hab tausende Jack Daniels auf Erden aufgemacht
Und wenn ich deswegen am Ende auch mal sterbe schau dann passts
Es ist echt wie ein Gefängnis manchmal dachte ich ich kriegs hin
Doch dann hing ich ständig wieder an der Flasche wie ein Gin
Ich hab schon manchen Menschen schlimmes angetan ich Spinner
Keinen Schimmer alles weg ich kann mich nicht daran erinnern
Und wie immer führt der erste Weg am Morgen zur Toilette
Und ich schwör Morgen ist Ende mach mir sorgen ich verrecke

But anyway it's my turn so let me introduce
Special One first up from the gangsta crew
Known as TCD with a title and a rep, it's quite apparent
Serving funky shit to keep you motherfuckers staring
Pump it up, mack shit for your ears
Kick it loud and clear, making hoes disappear
Hittin' donuts in a tre' sideways, to the
Next light, triple gold thangs and my shit's tight
Five deep mobbin' through in The Town

Damn, this shit's hittin' hard in the trunk
Got me three wheel switchin' on them bitches on the next block
Headed straight to the top
And as long as my skills pay the bills I'mma never stop
Kicking that shit you love
Pass the dank and a drank for the bitch to buzz
It's a ghetto thang so I bring the ghetto slang
Hookin' niggas like the 'caine when I do my thang

Expedition, funky expedition

Daughter on attack with the knack to keep your speakers blowing
Riding with a gat in my lap and one finger on a Zap
Looking for some niggas in a Cadillac

Special One and CMG blazin' up a joint
Keepin' a steady pace in a car race
Sidin' on a strip with a grip and an eighth in my glove case
Never leavin' a trace, but leaving the 5-O's blind
'Cause I'm fucking conscious of these streets of mine
Rollin' lit with the tint shed shallow
And I'll be back around the block for niggas to jock tomorrow

With hella scratch to get at

Jock 'em for a minute let 'em take us out to eat
But I concentrate on all my niggas later
I flow to this shit 'cause I'm Special One the greater

Coming out the spot I had to duck because a nigga tried to buck me
I'm easing on the Glock like, ""What up, hop""
Buck's pulling out on cops cause I want free Glocks
What the fuck, bring your bitch-ass type brigade
Hitting them all, hand guns and hand grenades
I resemble the man that's wanted for murder
Got your block locked down, so don't come any further
In my clip is a .22 dum-dum

And all the real niggas that was shot by beast
Around the way all we do is spark mad ism
Ladies be like, ""Yo, he's Buckshot right there, that is him""
But let's get with the cipher, kid, pass the eight
So I can wet my lungs and blow smoke in your face
Word to Jah, niggas can't touch me, kid
Cause I'm too nice to do bids or ever hit skid
Fronts in the bottom of my teeth like whatever shit
On the real, gettin played, what, I never did
Cause on the mic I gotta represent the real niggas
The field niggas get the muthafuckin ill triggers
Word to Herb, lick shot with my verb
And keep my hand on my grip when I play the curb
I never got caught by a undercover DT
Nah chill E T&T can't see me
You grab mics from the ones I left broken

Late at night, I catch a buzz, then I write
The type of ill shit to make the mind feel tight
And be wanting to battle like every five minutes
But I'm in this like Guinness so that ass get finished
Straight from the floors of hell, feel the flame
You faggot ass, I heard your nickname's Blaine
I hit your brain and you felt the pain, maintain
When it comes to a battle you know the Buck reigns
I overthrow the flow, niggas be like, ""Yo, how'd you do that?""
Bitches be like ""Yo who that, you're all that, yo, true that""
Never forget that I'm the one you thought wouldn't make it
I used to make money, now I just take it
I do what I gotta do to bring you to the concrete
Bucking niggas down cause they think shit is sweet
I keep a Tec whenever I'm in the projects
Ease out, then flex, in effect like Wreckx
Buck to your head, now die is my slogan
Don't front, you know I got you open

[Chorus]
Take my heart
Take my soul
I surrender everything to Your control
And let all that is within me
Lift up to You and say
I am Yours and Yours alone
Completely

[Bridge]
Right here, right now
And for the rest of my life
Hear me say

[Chorus]
Take my heart
Take my soul
I surrender everything to Your control
And let all that is within me
Lift up to You and say
I am Yours and Yours alone
Completely

[Outro]

259,Bucktown,"[Verse 1: Steele]
I walk around town with the pound strapped down to my side
No fronting just in case I gotta smoke something
Round here heads don't act their age
You might be another dead bwoy pon rage
Enter the cipher with your lighter
L's are ready, prepare for another all nighter
But keep a watch for the cops cos they rock Glocks
Coming on the block trying to rock knots
Pigs be acting like they bigger than us niggas from the streets
Cos we stalk mad deep and dem walk beats
I guess dem hold a grudge cos I won't budge
Playing tough, staring down the judge with my hands cuffed
Standing there with my nappy hair and my dirty gear
Au revoir yeah now I'm up outta here
Pigs look me up and down with a frown
Is it cos I'm brown or is it because I'm from Bucktown?

[Hook]
Bucktown!
Home of the original gun clappers
(Repeat x8)

[Verse 2: Tek]
Got five MC that wanna contest we
Got your nooses ready hanging over the trees
Bring on your sounds and get drowned by my massive
Kill you batty boy and hold your lover for hostage
Knock knock niggy-knock that's four shots empty
On a violator that was sent out to get me
I'm tore up from the floor up and everything's black
But still I'm on point ready to buck, ain't nothing sweet, jack
Bucktown, I represent it on the love love
Deeply rooted from my Timbs to my dick above
Don't sweat the bulge coming from my hip
Grip what you get hit when I let my tool click
Nowhere to run, ambush lurks in the dark
Heltah Skeltah smirks while you're getting torn apart
Here come the rude bwoys with the ganja plants
Smif-N-Wessun generals of the Boot Camp

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tek]
Another murderer, just another prankster
Rude bwoy dead cause him thought him was a gangster
Tried to live the life of a hood from the streets
Test the wrong dread, now he's in eternal sleep
Mr Ripper I lurk in the Stuy
Twist up the ganja when I want to get high
With my bredren, a buddah session, learn your lesson
Or get blasted by Mr Smif or Mr Wessun

[Verse 4: Steele]
Bucktown's everywhere I swear
It's clear to me, you feel the weed, now I really see
Nightfall round the way
Original heads come out to play
Puff herb, break day
It's just a regular, everyday state of being I
Mind holds the weight, rhymes free the mind in time
I find reality follows me where I roam
360 degrees back home in...

Young OG
A Boogie, what's up?
Another one
Yeah

[Verse 1: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
You used to be my baby
Remember when you used to wear my chain and my bracelets
I know you blushin' when I make a statement
So don't you worry 'bout them bitches I don't entertain them
They only want me 'cause I'm famous
I'm A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie but just call me baby
And I be rollin' with the gangstas
Mask on, gloves on like they contagious
But what you think about me
Anything I put on I be lookin' ode
Pull up to a party in a 'Rari 88
Goin' 200 it was me and E3
Pray when I decided I'ma go my own way
She all on my body and she hopin' I stay
I guess that's what happens when you run into the C.R.E.A.M
Cash rules everything around me (Cash rules everything around me)
But even when I'm with a new hoe
I still end up thinkin' 'bout you
Because they just don't know
They don't know me like they really want to
And everywhere I go
When I come through all I see is wild thots

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild thots
Wild, wild, wild
When I come through all I see is wild thots

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Look, let's keep it real and never fake it (fake it)
Yeah, I'm gettin' money, they can't take it, take it, take it (I know)
The vibe is off, I gotta shake it (skrt)
Look, I'm nothin' like them no one to mistake it
The sun is gon' shine even through the shady
Just 'cause I play it Melo, don't think you can trade me
You can't buy class, I bought a new Mercedes
Came back on them birds, I'm the new Tom Brady
Wow, all I see is wild life when I'm out
Bunch of snakes, couple cats with my life in they mouth
Lion like they gorillas really soft as chinchillas
Don't sweat the butterfly after you diss the caterpillar
That's wild
Wild, wild, wild
When I come through all I see is wild thots

262,It's All Good,"[Intro]
Aye, hold on change that sound like a piano or something it sounds stupid I don't like that, okay yeah

[Verse 1]
Yo, you ever had a homie who was fake as fuck (yup)
Hate your guts, but the moment you came rolling through ballin'
They wanna say what's up (what's up)
Knowing that you finna' be hot (G)
But I don't owe you niggas diddly squat (nah)
So here help me out by kicking these rocks
Before I got my deal you use to back stab me (what?)
Laugh at me, tell these women I act nasty (ewww)
So what?
You hooked me up with the girl that yes, I'm datin' now
But I know if you had the chance to fuck her you would take her down
You slipped up like you done stepped into an oil leak
Now you got me heated up and boiling
You the definition of unloyalty
Probably plotting how to go destroy the scene
But you'll never destroy the royal king
I know you always reminiscing (uh-huh)
And mad 'cause I'm resisting and won't take the time to listen making us more distant
You on that cold hearted shit
Look how Hollywood Marcus is
You could have been a part of this, but shit you'll probably

[Hook]
Fuck my girl and keep it on the down low
But yo it's all good now though
You tried to, leak my songs and give 'em free downloads
But yo it's all good now though
Now if you thinkin' you my buddy
But always acting funny
Then you'll never be close to me (Fuck that!)
Said if you thinking you my buddy tryin' strip me for my money
Then you'll never be close to me (Fuck that!)
Nigga, friends, friends, how many of us have them, I don't really know anymore

[Verse 2]
I gotta about 3, 4, 5 of them left
And they like my brothers, yes
They all reside on the West
They're down to ride nothing less
That's what their supposed to do
No, but you, walking around like you don't even know the rules
Putting me in bogus moves
Got me stressed out doing yoga moves (Shit)
You ain't no homie, just a load of duke
You mad 'cause honeys never notice you (Well)
Do take it personal (Why)
You'll never look half as good as I do in person nope
I'll never hold you down
I'm flossing on you now
I'm causing problems my momma like Hopsin, awww you foul
I know it's you who's calling blocked ID
But you will not find me
I'm not lying, so stop trying
It's just a waste of time and you a waste of mine
Say goodbye this song is for you George, since you're a grateful guy

[Hook]
Fuck my girl and keep it on the down low
But yo it's all good now though
You tried to, leak my songs and give 'em free downloads

[Verse 3]
Friendship has been fucked
Quit hittin' SwizZz up
You calling him like you tryin' give him a free dick suck
You ain't a part of the movement, stupid you just blew it
And this shit right here proves it
And don't you email me talking about yo, what's up fool
Thank you for all that you done for me but fuck you
And if you wanna act like a rowdy ape and retaliate
Meet me in the alley late
I'll serve yo ass the Cali way
So don't you dare give my CD's a leak
I'll get your ass easily
Your girlfriend lives right up the street from me
I'll snatch her out from underneath the sheets and while she screams police
I'ma just talk to her grimy like I was Keak da Sneak
Well congratulations you've been dissed
Don't get mad at me, 'cause who did this?
You did this, so what did we learn today?
Never leak your friend's songs
'Cause if you think I'm gonna let it slide
Then you dead wrong

[Interlude]
I trusted yo ass man
You had my whole fucking album sitting there on your damn laptop
Leaking my shit, you're a mothafuckin' leaker
I'll never trust yo ass, rawr!

263,I Want You,"[Verse 1: Elijah Kelley, Evan Ross, Jude Demorest]
Tell me girl, do you know what you want?
Tell me girl, do you understand how rare it is indeed
Just to know who you are?
Oh, tell me girl, what’s in your heart?
I know it’s hard, can you play a part?
Can you take your mind off the silly things
Keep your eye on the ball?
I know this inconsistent relationship trip is killing youIt’s killing me too, believe it or not
But you ain’t gotta worry
'Bout nobody comin round here
Getting none of this, or takin’ your spot

[Pre-Chorus: Brittany O'Grady, Ryan Destiny, Luke James]
Do you think about the times that we’re together?
And she said, “No,but I think about the times we ain’t together”
And I said “Oh”
I said, “No, this ain’t right”
Since your hands got too much time
Staying up all hours of the night
Checking my page, seeing who and what I like
On my timeline, seeing who is new
Don’t worry about who follows who
Baby here’s the truth
Yeah I see a lot of people
But baby I want you

[Chorus: Luke James, Ryan Destiny, Both]
I’m try a love you true
Celebrate who you are
Appreciate you for you
Baby I want you
We need to let go of the jealousy
Cause turnin’ our back won’t do
Without compromise, we’d lose
Oh baby I want you

[Verse 2: Jude Demorest, Brittany O'Grady, Evan Ross]
It’s you, I really can’t say enough about you
Yeah baby I choose
All I wanna do is be around you
Don’t you worry ‘bout the old
Cause we’re on to the new
Ain’t studdin’ them, ‘cause I’m thinkin’ ‘bout you
Know that nothing can come between
What we have and what we do
So for the times that I’m gone
Know that this much is true
Baby you are not alone
So I’m asking you

[Pre-Chorus: Elijah Kelley, Luke James, Ryan Destiny]
Do you think about the times that we’re together?
And she said, “No, I think about the times we ain’t together”
I said “Oh”
What in the world are we tryna do?
What we tryna say?
What we tryna prove?
Fussin’ and fightin’ like we want a war
When we both know that ain’t true
As long as the sky is blue
As long as the homie sing a song or two
Baby it’s true, I’ma see a whole lot of people
But baby I want you

[Chorus: Luke James, Ryan Destiny, Both]
I’m try a love you true
Celebrate who you are
Appreciate you for you
Baby I want you
We need to let go of the jealousy
Cause turnin’ our back won’t do
Without compromise, we’d lose
Oh baby I want you

[Post-Chorus: Luke James, Brittany O'Grady, Jude Demorest]
Oh baby I choose you, happy to have you
And not cause I need you, but baby I want you
There’s a whole lot of noise in the world going on
A whole lot of drama we can cause
If we want, but we don’t so we won’t
Cause baby I want you

[Outro: Elijah Kelley, Ryan Destiny, Brittany O'Grady, Evan Ross, (Jude Demorest)]
I want you babe
Because I want you, because I want you
Not cause I need you, I really want you babe
And I guess I want you, happy to have you
Not cause I need you, because I want you babe

264,I Believe,"[ELDER PRICE]
Ever since I was a child, I tried to be the best...
So what happened?
My family and friends all said I was blessed...
So what happened?

It was supposed to be all so exciting, to be teaching of Christ 'cross the sea
But I allowed my faith to be shaken – oh, what's the matter with me?
I've always longed to help the needy, to do the things I never dared
This was the time for me to step up, so then why was I so scared?

A warlord who shoots people in the face – what's so scary about that?
I must trust that my Lord is mightier and always has my back
Now I must be completely devout; I can't have even one shred of doubt!

I believe that the Lord God created the universe
I believe that he sent his only son to die for my sins
And I believe that ancient Jews built boats and sailed to America
I am a Mormon!
And a Mormon just believes

You cannot just believe part-way, you have to believe in it all
My problem was doubting the Lord's will, instead of standing tall
I can't allow myself to have any doubt, it's time to set my worries free
Time to show the world what Elder Price is about, and share the power inside of me!

I believe that God has a plan for all of us
I believe that plan involves me getting my own planet
And I believe that the current President of the Church, Thomas Monson, speaks directly to God
I am a Mormon!
And, dang it, a Mormon just believes! (A Mormon just believes!)

I know that I must go and do the things my God commands (Things my God commands!)
I realize now why he sent me here!
If you ask the Lord in faith, he will always answer you
Just believe in him and have no fear

[UGANDAN SOLDIER]
(General! We have an intruder! He just walked right into camp!)

[ELDER PRICE]
I believe that Satan has a hold of you
I believe that the Lord God has sent me here!
And I believe that in 1978 God changed his mind about black people! (Black people!)
You can be a Mormon!
A Mormon who just believes...

[GENERAL BUTT-FUCKING NAKED]
(The fuck is this?)

[ELDER PRICE]
And now I can feel the excitement: this is the moment I was born to do
And I feel so incredible to be sharing my faith with you
The scriptures say that if you ask in faith, if you ask God himself, you'll know
But you must ask him without any doubt, and let your spirit grow! (Let your spirit grow!)

I believe that God lives on a planet called Kolob!
I believe that Jesus has his own planet as well
And I believe that the Garden of Eden was in Jackson County, Missouri


If you believe, the Lord will reveal it
And you'll know it's all true – you'll just feel it
You'll be a Mormon!
And, by gosh, a Mormon just believes
(A Mormon just believes)

(Just believe, a Mormon just believes)
Oh, I believe! (Just believe, a Mormon just...)
I believe! (...believes!)",Original Broadway Cast of The Book of Mormon,1994,"[100, 100, 99]",3
265,Breathe Again,"[Verse 1]
Car is parked, bags are packed
But what kind of heart doesn't look back
At the comfortable glow from the porch, the one I will still call yours?
All those words came undone and now I'm not the only one
Facing the ghosts that decide if the fire inside still burns

[Chorus]
All I have, all I need, he's the air I would kill to breathe
Holds my love in his hands, still I'm searching for something
Out of breath, I am left hoping someday I'll breathe again
I'll breathe again

[Verse 2]
Open up next to you and my secrets become your truth
And the distance between that was sheltering me comes in full view
Hang my head, break my heart built from all I have torn apart
And my burden to bear is a love I can't carry anymore

[Chorus]
All I have, all I need, he's the air I would kill to breathe
Holds my love in his hands, still I'm searching for something
Out of breath, I am left hoping someday I'll breathe again

[Bridge]
It hurts to be here
I only wanted love from you
It hurts to be here
What am I going to do?

[Chorus]
All I have, all I need, he's the air I would kill to breathe
Holds my love in his hands, still I'm searching for something
Out of breath, I am left hoping someday I'll breathe again
I'll breathe again
All I have, all I need, he's the air I would kill to breathe
Holds my love in his hands, still I'm searching for something
Out of breath, I am left hoping someday I'll breathe again
I'll breathe again",Sara Bareilles,1994,"[39, 37, 34, 30, 26, 26, 21, 20, 20, 15, 13, 10, 8, 7, 5, 5, 4, 3, 4, 3, 3, 5, 6, 6]",24

Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I should take it slow
Here I go, here I go, here I go

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Off again, there he go, to another dimension, my mind
Body, soul imprisoned, my eye probably goin' ballistic, but, listen
I'm missin' a couple of screws, they ain't never do drillin' true
You been sippin' away at the truth, a double shot of wisdom'll do
Do, do, rollin' through, hittin' switches
Rolling ditches, blowin' kisses, to the bitches, holdin' biscuits
What's the business? Beat the system
Co-defendants, blow the sentence, go to prison
Go to church and pray the father, Lord forgive us (Amen)
And only God can judge me (Yeah)
And he don't like no ugly
I look so fuckin' good, most dykes'll fuck me, buddy
Yeah, I'm a piece of shit, I know I plead the fifth
I tell her, ""Holler if ya need some dick""
The devotion is gettin' hopeless, but, hold it, I'm gettin' close
As my soul is, I'm seein' ghosts, a solo is now a poet
Hypnosis overdose on potions, adjustin' to the motions
And gettin' out all my emotions

[Chorus: Rod Stewart & Miguel]
Every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes, I am
So every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I should take it slow
Here I go, here I go, here I go

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, this type of shit
Make a nigga wanna flip September through August
This type of shit got 'em bustin' out the clip
In the middle of the office
And a message to the bosses
The Misfits' new outfit is on the bloglist
Gorgeous hoes keep on the sayin' that they 'caused it
'Cause the Porsches get 'em nauseous
Plus I ain't even mad yet, niggas caught me in a good mood
Paparazzi wanna nag a nigga chillin' at the bag check
Hope they show me in my good shoes
When papa got the brand new bag
Flacko got the brand new Raf, that's good news
""Hood dudes usually don't look like you""
How it feel to get a deal and come back
And the whole hood look like you?
Screamin', ""Pimp Squad, hold it down!""
Can't drive, bitch, I'm legally blind, bitch
If I live or die, it's up to me to decide
Shit, niggas coppin' guns like they legal to buy
The only key to survive and get a piece of the pie
Is to agree with a lot or just believe a façade, bitch
And I'll be fine just-a drinkin' my wine, bitch

[Bridge: Miguel]
I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more
I'll be fine, sippin' wine
Takin' time slow
I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more
I'll be fine, sippin' wine

[Chorus: Miguel & Rod Stewart]
So every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes, I am
Every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
I don't care if I ever know
Here I go, here I go, here I go!

I got bitches in the livin' room gettin' it on
And they ain't leavin' till six in the mornin'

In a hole, taught myself how to get out of it
And balance it with talents, wit
'Cause life is like a penny (Life is like a penny)
'Cause it's only one percent
Who overcome the shit they've underwent
I went AWOL like what my back was up against

And I don't know if I would call that white privilege, yeah
But I get it, how it feels to be judged by pigment
Besides getting it from both sides of the tracks
But I swore I'd get them back
Even if it meant selling my soul to get my revenge and (What?)
Thought of a scheme and it got me to thinking
If I can believe in myself, I could prolly achieve it
That’s part of the reason I do all my talking with ink
And as long as I'm breathing, I vow to smother and beat them

I was getting my ass beat twice a week (What?)
Looking for a place for the night where I could sleep (Yeah)

If I could find some change and scrape up for a bite to eat
If Denaun and me find a couple dimes a piece
Twenty five cents each'd get us a bag of chips
We'd be glad to get that even we if we had to split
We'd do backward flips, looking back at it
I think that would fit with the definition of not having shit
Couple that with the fact my mother was batshit
Pop was a sack of shit, yeah, he died, but I gave half a shit
Yeah, which brings me back to the dear 'ol dad that I zero had
Since a year-old, forty-seven year-old scab
Just to hear them words, ear piercing
Like my earlobe stabbed with a needle for an earring
Should I feel upset? You were dead to me 'fore you died
Me? Tear no shed
Should I have made a mural at your funeral?
Had your coffin draped with a hero's flag?
Where the fuck you were at
When De'Angelo done hurt me real bad at the Rio Grande?
Never met your grandkids, fucking coward
Only guts you had was from your stomach fat
I couldn't see your ass goin' to Heaven
So I'm asking for a pass to go to Hell
So I can whip your fucking ass
I hate that I'll never get to say ""I hate you"" to your face
No coming back from where I'm going

Dig with the blade of it then I step on the metal
Vendetta to settle, tell the Devil

I'm leaving heaven (You know what? Maybe if I had had you)

We'd be listening to the radio so loud and so strong
Every golden nugget coming like a gift of the gods

And I know you've got the ashes to prove it
I treasure your love
I want to show you how to use it
You've been through a lot of pain in the dirt

274,It Ain't Hard To Tell,"[Produced by Large Professor]

[Verse 1]
It ain't hard to tell, I excel, then prevail
The mic is contacted, I attract clientele
My mic check is life or death, breathin' a sniper's breath
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like The Shining, sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket linin'
Hit the Earth like a comet—invasion!
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian: half-man, half-amazin'
‘Cause in my physical I can express through song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong
I drink Moët with Medusa, give her shotguns in Hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale; it ain't hard to tell

[Verse 2]
The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Not stories by Aesop
Place your loot up, parties I shoot up
Nas, I analyze, drop a jew-el, inhale from the L
School a fool well, you feel it like Braille
It ain't hard to tell, I kick a skill, like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills, I'm Ill plus Matic
I freak beats, slam it, like Iron Sheik
Jam like a TEC with correct techniques
So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me
Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me
I leave 'em froze, like heroin in your nose
Nas will rock well; it ain't hard to tell

[Verse 3]
This rhythmatic explosion
Is what your frame of mind has chosen
I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggas is frozen
Speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin
End like Leviathan, it's deep? Well, let me try again
Wisdom be leakin' out my grapefruit, troop
I dominate break loops, givin' mics men-e-strual cycles
Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle
And groove even smoother than moves by Villanova
You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra
Packin' like a Rasta in the weed spot
Vocals will squeeze Glocks
MCs eavesdrop, though they need not to sneak
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas' raps should be locked in a cell; it ain't hard to tell",Nas,1994,"[98, 95, 91, 100, 100, 91, 97, 97]",8

So in love are we two

So in love (so in love)
In a world of our own (so in love)

So in love (so in love)
Are you and I (so in love)

To touch you, to feel your body close to me
I just want to hold you in my arms forever
I love you, baby

278,Dunkie Butt (Please Please Please),"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever

Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture

So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation

While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

And I remember I tenderly imagined how, at this very moment, my mother would be moving slowly about the narrow bedroom I had left behind for ever, folding up and putting away all my little relics, the tumbled garments I would not need any more, the scores for which there had been no room in my trunks, the concert programmes I'd abandoned; she would linger over this torn ribbon and that faded photograph with all the half-joyous, half-sorrowful emotions of a woman on her daughter's wedding day. And, in the midst of my bridal triumph, I felt a pang of loss as if, when he put the gold band on my finger, I had, in some way, ceased to be her child in becoming his wife.

Are you sure, she'd said when they delivered the gigantic box that held the wedding dress he'd bought me, wrapped up in tissue paper and red ribbon like a Christmas gift of crystallized fruit. Are you sure you love him? There was a dress for her, too; black silk, with the dull, prismatic sheen of oil on water, finer than anything she'd worn since that adventurous girlhood in Indo-China, daughter of a rich tea planter. My eagle-featured, indomitable mother; what other student at the Conservatoire could boast that her mother had outfaced a junkful of Chinese pirates, nursed a village through a visitation of the plague, shot a man-eating tiger with her own hand and all before she was as old as I?

'Are you sure you love him?'

'I'm sure I want to marry him,' I said.

And would say no more. She sighed, as if it was with reluctance that she might at last banish the spectre of poverty from its habitual place at our meagre table. For my mother herself had gladly, scandalously, defiantly beggared herself for love; and, one fine day, her gallant soldier never returned from the wars, leaving his wife and child a legacy of tears that never quite dried, a cigar box full of medals and the antique service revolver that my mother, grown magnificently eccentric in hardship, kept always in her reticule, in case--how I teased her--she was surprised by footpads on her way home from the grocer's shop.

Now and then a starburst of lights spattered the drawn blinds as if the railway company had lit up all the stations through which we passed in celebration of the bride. My satin nightdress had just been shaken from its wrappings; it had slipped over my young girl's pointed breasts and shoulders, supple as a garment of heavy water, and now teasingly caressed me, egregious, insinuating, nudging between my thighs as I shifted restlessly in my narrow berth. His kiss, his kiss with tongue and teeth in it and a rasp of beard, had hinted to me, though with the same exquisite tact as this nightdress he'd given me, of the wedding night, which would be voluptuously deferred until we lay in his great ancestral bed in the sea-girt, pinnacled domain that lay, still, beyond the grasp of my imagination ... that magic place, the fairy castle whose walls were made of foam, that legendary habitation in which he had been born. To which, one day, I might bear an heir. Our destination, my destiny.

Above the syncopated roar of the train, I could hear his even, steady breathing. Only the communicating door kept me from my husband and it stood open. If I rose up on my elbow, I could see the dark, leonine shape of his head and my nostrils caught a whiff of the opulent male scent of leather and spices that always accompanied him and sometimes, during his courtship, had been the only hint he gave me that he had come into my mother's sitting room, for, though he was a big man, he moved as softly as if all his shoes had soles of velvet, as if his footfall turned the carpet into snow.

He had loved to surprise me in my abstracted solitude at the piano. He would tell them not to announce him, then soundlessly open the door and softly creep up behind me with his bouquet of hot-house flowers or his box of marrons glacés, lay his offering upon the keys and clasp his hands over my eyes as I was lost in a Debussy prelude. But that perfume of spiced leather always betrayed him; after my first shock, I was forced always to mimic surprise, so that he would not be disappointed.

He was older than I. He was much older than I; there were streaks of pure silver in his dark mane. But his strange, heavy, almost waxen face was not lined by experience. Rather, experience seemed to have washed it perfectly smooth, like a stone on a beach whose fissures have been eroded by successive tides. And sometimes that face, in stillness when he listened to me playing, with the heavy eyelids folded over eyes that always disturbed me by their absolute absence of light, seemed to me like a mask, as if his real face, the face that truly reflected all the life he had led in the world before he met me, before, even, I was born, as though that face lay underneath this mask. Or else, elsewhere. As though he had laid by the face in which he had lived for so long in order to offer my youth a face unsigned by the years.

And, elsewhere, I might see him plain. Elsewhere. But, where?

In, perhaps, that castle to which the train now took us, that marvellous castle in which he had been born.

Even when he asked me to marry him, and I said: 'Yes,' still he did not lose that heavy, fleshy composure of his. I know it must seem a curious analogy, a man with a flower, but sometimes he seemed to me like a lily. Yes. A lily. Possessed of that strange, ominous calm of a sentient vegetable, like one of those cobra-headed, funereal lilies whose white sheaths are curled out of a flesh as thick and tensely yielding to the touch as vellum. When I said that I would marry him, not one muscle in his face stirred, but he let out a long, extinguished sigh. I thought: Oh! how he must want me! And it was as though the imponderable weight of his desire was a force I might not withstand, not by virtue of its violence but because of its very gravity.

He had the ring ready in a leather box lined with crimson velvet, a fire opal the size of a pigeon's egg set in a complicated circle of dark antique gold. My old nurse, who still lived with my mother and me, squinted at the ring askance: opals are bad luck, she said. But this opal had been his own mother's ring, and his grandmother's, and her mother's before that, given to an ancestor by Catherine de Medici ... every bride that came to the castle wore it, time out of mind. And did he give it to his other wives and have it back from them? asked the old woman rudely; yet she was a snob. She hid her incredulous joy at my marital coup--her little Marquise--behind a façade of fault-finding. But, here, she touched me. I shrugged and turned my back pettishly on her. I did not want to remember how he had loved other women before me, but the knowledge often teased me in the threadbare self-confidence of the small hours.

I was seventeen and knew nothing of the world; my Marquis had been married before, more than once, and I remained a little bemused that, after those others, he should now have chosen me. Indeed, was he not still in mourning for his last wife? Tsk, tsk, went my old nurse.

And even my mother had been reluctant to see her girl whisked off by a man so recently bereaved. A Romanian countess, a lady of high fashion. Dead just three short months before I met him, a boating accident, at his home, in Brittany. They never found her body but I rummaged through the back copies of the society magazines my old nanny kept in a trunk under her bed and tracked down her photograph. The sharp muzzle of a pretty, witty, naughty monkey; such potent and bizarre charm, of a dark, bright, wild yet worldly thing whose natural habitat must have been some luxurious interior decorator's jungle filled with potted palms and tame, squawking parakeets.

Before that? Her face is common property; everyone painted her but the Redon engraving I liked best, The Evening Star Walking on the Rim of Night. To see her skeletal, enigmatic grace, you would never think she had been a barmaid in a café in Montmartre until Puvis de Chavannes saw her and had her expose her flat breasts and elongated thighs to his brush. And yet it was the absinthe doomed her, or so they said.

The first of all his ladies? That sumptuous diva; I had heard her sing Isolde, precociously musical child that I was, taken to the opera for a birthday treat. My first opera; I had heard her sing Isolde. With what white-hot passion had she burned from the stage! So that you could tell she would die young. We sat high up, halfway to heaven in the gods, yet she half-blinded me. And my father, still alive (oh, so long ago), took hold of my sticky little hand, to comfort me, in the last act, yet all I heard was the glory of her voice.

Married three times within my own brief lifetime to three different graces, now, as if to demonstrate the eclecticism of his taste, he had invited me to join this gallery of beautiful women, I, the poor widow's child with my mouse-coloured hair that still bore the kinks of the plaits from which it had so recently been freed, my bony hips, my nervous, pianist's fingers.

He was rich as Croesus. The night before our wedding--a simple affair, at the Mairie, because his countess was so recently gone--he took my mother and me, curious coincidence, to see Tristan. And, do you know, my heart swelled and ached so during the Liebestod that I thought I must truly love him. Yes. I did. On his arm, all eyes were upon me. The whispering crowd in the foyer parted like the Red Sea to let us through. My skin crisped at his touch.

How my circumstances had changed since the first time I heard those voluptuous chords that carry such a charge of deathly passion in them! Now, we sat in a loge, in red velvet armchairs, and a braided, bewigged flunkey brought us a silver bucket of iced champagne in the interval. The froth spilled over the rim of my glass and drenched my hands, I thought: My cup runneth over. And I had on a Poiret dress. He had prevailed upon my reluctant mother to let him buy my trousseau; what would I have gone to him in, otherwise? Twice-darned underwear, faded gingham, serge skirts, hand-me-downs. So, for the opera, I wore a sinuous shift of white muslin tied with a silk string under the breasts. And everyone stared at me. And at his wedding gift.

His wedding gift, clasped round my throat. A choker of rubies, two inches wide, like an extraordinarily precious slit throat.

After the Terror, in the early days of the Directory, the aristos who'd escaped the guillotine had an ironic fad of tying a red ribbon round their necks at just the point where the blade would have sliced it through, a red ribbon like the memory of a wound. And his grandmother, taken with the notion, had her ribbon made up in rubies; such a gesture of luxurious defiance! That night at the opera comes back to me even now ... the white dress; the frail child within it; and the flashing crimson jewels round her throat, bright as arterial blood.

I saw him watching me in the gilded mirrors with the assessing eye of a connoisseur inspecting horseflesh, or even of a housewife in the market, inspecting cuts on the slab. I'd never seen, or else had never acknowledged, that regard of his before, the sheer carnal avarice of it; and it was strangely magnified by the monocle lodged in his left eye. When I saw him look at me with lust, I dropped my eyes but, in glancing away from him, I caught sight of myself in the mirror. And I saw myself, suddenly, as he saw me, my pale face, the way the muscles in my neck stuck out like thin wire. I saw how much that cruel necklace became me. And, for the first time in my innocent and confined life, I sensed in myself a potentiality for corruption that took my breath away.

The next day, we were married.

The train slowed, shuddered to a halt. Lights; clank of metal; a voice declaring the name of an unknown, never-to-be visited station; silence of the night; the rhythm of his breathing, that I should sleep with, now, for the rest of my life. And I could not sleep. I stealthily sat up, raised the blind a little and huddled against the cold window that misted over with the warmth of my breathing, gazing out at the dark platform towards those rectangles of domestic lamplight that promised warmth, company, a supper of sausages hissing in a pan on the stove for the station master, his children tucked up in bed asleep in the brick house with the painted shutters ... all the paraphernalia of the everyday world from which I, with my stunning marriage, had exiled myself.

Into marriage, into exile; I sensed it, I knew it--that, henceforth, I would always be lonely. Yet that was part of the already familiar weight of the fire opal that glimmered like a gypsy's magic ball, so that I could not take my eyes off it when I played the piano. This ring, the bloody bandage of rubies, the wardrobe of clothes from Poiret and Worth, his scent of Russian leather--all had conspired to seduce me so utterly that I could not say I felt one single twinge of regret for the world of tar-tines and maman that now receded from me as if drawn away on a string, like a child's toy, as the train began to throb again as if in delighted anticipation of the distance it would take me.

The first grey streamers of the dawn now flew in the sky and an eldritch half-light seeped into the railway carriage. I heard no change in his breathing but my heightened, excited senses told me he was awake and gazing at me. A huge man, an enormous man, and his eyes, dark and motionless as those eyes the ancient Egyptians painted upon their sarcophagi, fixed upon me. I felt a certain tension in the pit of my stomach, to be so watched, in such silence. A match struck. He was igniting a Romeo y Julieta fat as a baby's arm.

'Soon,' he said in his resonant voice that was like the tolling of a bell and I felt, all at once, a sharp premonition of dread that lasted only as long as the match flared and I could see his white, broad face as if it were hovering, disembodied, above the sheets, illuminated from below like a grotesque carnival head. Then the flame died, the cigar glowed and filled the compartment with a remembered fragrance that made me think of my father, how he would hug me in a warm fug of Havana, when I was a little girl, before he kissed me and left me and died.

As soon as my husband handed me down from the high step of the train, I smelled the amniotic salinity of the ocean. It was November; the trees, stunted by the Atlantic gales, were bare and the lonely halt was deserted but for his leather-gaitered chauffeur waiting meekly beside the sleek black motor car. It was cold; I drew my furs about me, a wrap of white and black, broad stripes of ermine and sable, with a collar from which my head rose like the calyx of a wildflower. (I swear to you, I had never been vain until I met him.) The bell clanged; the straining train leapt its leash and left us at that lonely wayside halt where only he and I had descended. Oh, the wonder of it; how all that might of iron and steam had paused only to suit his convenience. The richest man in France.

'Madame.'

The chauffeur eyed me; was he comparing me, invidiously, to the countess, the artist's model, the opera singer? I hid behind my furs as if they were a system of soft shields. My husband liked me to wear my opal over my kid glove, a showy, theatrical trick--but the moment the ironic chauffeur glimpsed its simmering flash he smiled, as though it was proof positive I was his master's wife. And we drove towards the widening dawn, that now streaked half the sky with a wintry bouquet of pink of roses, orange of tiger-lilies, as if my husband had ordered me a sky from a florist. The day broke around me like a cool dream.

Sea; sand; a sky that melts into the sea--a landscape of misty pastels with a look about it of being continuously on the point of melting. A landscape with all the deliquescent harmonies of Debussy, of the études I played for him, the reverie I'd been playing that afternoon in the salon of the princess where I'd first met him, among the teacups and the little cakes, I, the orphan, hired out of charity to give them their digestive of music.

And, ah! his castle. The faery solitude of the place; with its turrets of misty blue, its courtyard, its spiked gate, his castle that lay on the very bosom of the sea with seabirds mewing about its attics, the casements opening on to the green and purple, evanescent departures of the ocean, cut off by the tide from land for half a day ... that castle, at home neither on the land nor on the water, a mysterious, amphibious place, contravening the materiality of both earth and the waves, with the melancholy of a mermaiden who perches on her rock and waits, endlessly, for a lover who had drowned far away, long ago. That lovely, sad, sea-siren of a place!

The tide was low; at this hour, so early in the morning, the causeway rose up out of the sea. As the car turned on to the wet cobbles between the slow margins of water, he reached out for my hand that had his sultry, witchy ring on it, pressed my fingers, kissed my palm with extraordinary tenderness. His face was as still as ever I'd seen it, still as a pond iced thickly over, yet his lips, that always looked so strangely red and naked between the black fringes of his beard, now curved a little. He smiled; he welcomed his bride home.

No room, no corridor that did not rustle with the sound of the sea and all the ceilings, the walls on which his ancestors in the stern regalia of rank lined up with their dark eyes and white faces, were stippled with refracted light from the waves which were always in motion; that luminous, murmurous castle of which I was the chatelaine, I, the little music student whose mother had sold all her jewellery, even her wedding ring, to pay the fees at the Conservatoire.

First of all, there was the small ordeal of my initial interview with the housekeeper, who kept this extraordinary machine, this anchored, castellated ocean liner, in smooth running order no matter who stood on the bridge; how tenuous, I thought, might be my authority here! She had a bland, pale, impassive, dislikeable face beneath the impeccably starched white linen head-dress of the region. Her greeting, correct but lifeless, chilled me; daydreaming, I dared presume too much on my status ... briefly wondered how I might install my old nurse, so much loved, however cosily incompetent, in her place. Ill-considered schemings! He told me this one had been his foster mother; was bound to his family in the utmost feudal complicity, 'as much part of the house as I am, my dear'. Now her thin lips offered me a proud little smile. She would be my ally as long as I was his. And with that, I must be content.

But, here, it would be easy to be content. In the turret suite he had given me for my very own, I could gaze out over the tumultuous Atlantic and imagine myself the Queen of the Sea. There was a Bechstein for me in the music room and, on the wall, another wedding present--an early Flemish primitive of Saint Cecilia at her celestial organ. In the prim charm of this saint, with her plump, sallow cheeks and crinkled brown hair, I saw myself as I could have wished to be. I warmed to a loving sensitivity I had not hitherto suspected in him. Then he led me up a delicate spiral staircase to my bedroom; before she discreetly vanished, the housekeeper set him chuckling with some, I dare say, lewd blessing for newlyweds in her native Breton. That I did not understand. That he, smiling, refused to interpret.

And there lay the grand, hereditary matrimonial bed, itself the size, almost, of my little room at home, with the gargoyles carved on its surfaces of ebony, vermilion lacquer, gold leaf; and its white gauze curtains, billowing in the sea breeze. Our bed. And surrounded by so many mirrors! Mirrors on all the walls, in stately frames of contorted gold, that reflected more white lilies than I'd ever seen in my life before. He'd filled the room with them, to greet the bride, the young bride. The young bride, who had become that multitude of girls I saw in the mirrors, identical in their chic navy blue tailor-mades, for travelling, madame, or walking. A maid had dealt with the furs. Henceforth, a maid would deal with everything.

'See,' he said, gesturing towards those elegant girls. 'I have acquired a whole harem for myself!'

I found that I was trembling. My breath came thickly. I could not meet his eye and turned my head away, out of pride, out of shyness, and watched a dozen husbands approach me in a dozen mirrors and slowly, methodically, teasingly, unfasten the buttons of my jacket and slip it from my shoulders. Enough! No; more! Off comes the skirt; and, next, the blouse of apricot linen that cost more than the dress I had for first communion. The play of the waves outside in the cold sun glittered on his monocle; his movements seemed to me deliberately coarse, vulgar. The blood rushed to my face again, and stayed there.

And yet, you see, I guessed it might be so--that we should have a formal disrobing of the bride, a ritual from the brothel. Sheltered as my life had been, how could I have failed, even in the world of prim bohemia in which I lived, to have heard hints of his world?

He stripped me, gourmand that he was, as if he were stripping the leaves off an artichoke--but do not imagine much finesse about it; this artichoke was no particular treat for the diner nor was he yet in any greedy haste. He approached his familiar treat with a weary appetite. And when nothing but my scarlet, palpitating core remained, I saw, in the mirror, the living image of an etching by Rops from the collection he had shown me when our engagement permitted us to be alone together ... the child with her sticklike limbs, naked but for her button boots, her gloves, shielding her face with her hand as though her face were the last repository of her modesty; and the old, monocled lecher who examined her, limb by limb. He in his London tailoring; she, bare as a lamb chop. Most pornographic of all confrontations. And so my purchaser unwrapped his bargain. And, as at the opera, when I had first seen my flesh in his eyes, I was aghast to feel myself stirring.

At once he closed my legs like a book and I saw again the rare movement of his lips that meant he smiled.

Not yet. Later. Anticipation is the greater part of pleasure, my little love.

And I began to shudder, like a racehorse before a race, yet also with a kind of fear, for I felt both a strange, impersonal arousal at the thought of love and at the same time a repugnance I could not stifle for his white, heavy flesh that had too much in common with the armfuls of arum lilies that filled my bedroom in great glass jars, those undertakers' lilies with the heavy pollen that powders your fingers as if you had dipped them in turmeric. The lilies I always associate with him; that are white. And stain you.

This scene from a voluptuary's life was now abruptly terminated. It turns out he has business to attend to; his estates, his companies--even on your honeymoon? Even then, said the red lips that kissed me before he left me alone with my bewildered senses--a wet, silken brush from his beard; a hint of the pointed tip of the tongue. Disgruntled, I wrapped a neglige of antique lace around me to sip the little breakfast of hot chocolate the maid brought me; after that, since it was second nature to me, there was nowhere to go but the music room and soon I settled down at my piano.

Yet only a series of subtle discords flowed from beneath my fingers: out of tune ... only a little out of tune; but I'd been blessed with perfect pitch and could not bear to play any more. Sea breezes are bad for pianos; we shall need a resident piano-tuner on the premises if I'm to continue with my studies! I flung down the lid in a little fury of disappointment; what should I do now, how shall I pass the long, sea-lit hours until my husband beds me?

I shivered to think of that.

His library seemed the source of his habitual odour of Russian leather. Row upon row of calf-bound volumes, brown and olive, with gilt lettering on their spines, the octavo in brilliant scarlet morocco. A deep-buttoned leather sofa to recline on. A lectern, carved like a spread eagle, that held open upon it an edition of Huysmans's Là-bas, from some over-exquisite private press; it had been bound like a missal, in brass, with gems of coloured glass. The rugs on the floor, deep, pulsing blues of heaven and red of the heart's dearest blood, came from Isfahan and Bokhara; the dark panelling gleamed; there was the lulling music of the sea and a fire of apple logs. The flames flickered along the spines inside a glass-fronted case that held books still crisp and new. Eliphas Levy; the name meant nothing to me. I squinted at a title or two: The Initiation, The Key of Mysteries, The Secret of Pandora's Box, and yawned. Nothing, here, to detain a seventeen-year-old girl waiting for her first embrace. I should have liked, best of all, a novel in yellow paper; I wanted to curl up on the rug before the blazing fire, lose myself in a cheap novel, munch sticky liqueur chocolates. If I rang for them, a maid would bring me chocolates.

Nevertheless, I opened the doors of that bookcase idly to browse. And I think I knew, I knew by some tingling of the fingertips, even before I opened that slim volume with no title at all on the spine, what I should find inside it. When he showed me the Rops, newly bought, dearly prized, had he not hinted that he was a connoisseur of such things? Yet I had not bargained for this, the girl with tears hanging on her cheeks like stuck pearls, her cunt a split fig below the great globes of her buttocks on which the knotted tails of the cat were about to descend, while a man in a black mask fingered with his free hand his prick, that curved upwards like the scimitar he held. The picture had a caption: 'Reproof of curiosity'. My mother, with all the precision of her eccentricity, had told me what it was that lovers did; I was innocent but not naïve. The Adventures of Eulalie at the Harem of the Grand Turk had been printed, according to the flyleaf, in Amsterdam in 1748, a rare collector's piece. Had some ancestor brought it back himself from that northern city? Or had my husband bought it for himself, from one of those dusty little bookshops on the Left Bank where an old man peers at you through spectacles an inch thick, daring you to inspect his wares ... I turned the pages in the anticipation of fear; the print was rusty. Here was another steel engraving: 'Immolation of the wives of the Sultan'. I knew enough for what I saw in that book to make me gasp.

There was a pungent intensification of the odour of leather that suffused his library; his shadow fell across the massacre.

'My little nun has found the prayerbooks, has she?' he demanded, with a curious mixture of mockery and relish; then, seeing my painful, furious bewilderment, he laughed at me aloud, snatched the book from my hands and put it down on the sofa.

'Have the nasty pictures scared Baby? Baby mustn't play with grownups' toys until she's learned how to handle them, must she?'

Then he kissed me. And with, this time, no reticence. He kissed me and laid his hand imperatively upon my breast, beneath the sheath of ancient lace. I stumbled on the winding stair that led to the bedroom, to the carved, gilded bed on which he had been conceived. I stammered foolishly: We've not taken luncheon yet; and, besides, it is broad daylight...

All the better to see you.

He made me put on my choker, the family heirloom of one woman who had escaped the blade. With trembling fingers, I fastened the thing about my neck. It was cold as ice and chilled me. He twined my hair into a rope and lifted it off my shoulders so that he could the better kiss the downy furrows below my ears; that made me shudder. And he kissed those blazing rubies, too. He kissed them before he kissed my mouth. Rapt, he intoned:' Of her apparel she retains/Only her sonorous jewellery.'

A dozen husbands impaled a dozen brides while the mewing gulls swung on invisible trapezes in the empty air outside.

I was brought to my senses by the insistent shrilling of the telephone. He lay beside me, felled like an oak, breathing stertorously, as if he had been fighting with me. In the course of that one-sided struggle, I had seen his deathly composure shatter like a porcelain vase flung against a wall; I had heard him shriek and blaspheme at the orgasm; I had bled. And perhaps I had seen his face without its mask; and perhaps I had not. Yet I had been infinitely dishevelled by the loss of my virginity.

I gathered myself together, reached into the cloisonne cupboard beside the bed that concealed the telephone and addressed the mouthpiece. His agent in New York. Urgent.

I shook him awake and rolled over on my side, cradling my spent body in my arms. His voice buzzed like a hive of distant bees. My husband. My husband, who, with so much love, filled my bedroom with lilies until it looked like an embalming parlour. Those somnolent lilies, that wave their heavy heads, distributing their lush, insolent incense reminiscent of pampered flesh.

When he'd finished with the agent, he turned to me and stroked the ruby necklace that bit into my neck, but with such tenderness now, that I ceased flinching and he caressed my breasts. My dear one, my little love, my child, did it hurt her? He's so sorry for it, such impetuousness, he could not help himself; you see, he loves her so ... and this lover's recitative of his brought my tears in a flood. I clung to him as though only the one who had inflicted the pain could comfort me for suffering it. For a while, he murmured to me in a voice I'd never heard before, a voice like the soft consolations of the sea. But then he unwound the tendrils of my hair from the buttons of his smoking jacket, kissed my cheek briskly and told me the agent from New York had called with such urgent business that he must leave as soon as the tide was low enough. Leave the castle? Leave France! And would be away for at least six weeks.

'But it is our honeymoon!'

A deal, an enterprise of hazard and chance involving several millions, lay in the balance, he said. He drew away from me into that waxworks stillness of his; I was only a little girl, I did not understand. And, he said unspoken to my wounded vanity, I have had too many honeymoons to find them in the least pressing commitments. I know quite well that this child I've bought with a handful of coloured stones and the pelts of dead beasts won't run away. But, after he'd called his Paris agent to book a passage for the States next day--just one tiny call, my little one--we should have time for dinner together.

And I had to be content with that,

A Mexican dish of pheasant with hazelnuts and chocolate; salad; white, voluptuous cheese; a sorbet of muscat grapes and Asti spumante. A celebration of Krug exploded festively. And then acrid black coffee in precious little cups so fine it shadowed the birds with which they were painted. I had Cointreau, he had cognac in the library, with the purple velvet curtains drawn against the night, where he took me to perch on his knee in a leather armchair beside the flickering log fire. He had made me change into that chaste little Poiret shift of white muslin; he seemed especially fond of it, my breasts showed through the flimsy stuff, he said, like little soft white doves that sleep, each one, with a pink eye open. But he would not let me take off my ruby choker, although it was growing very uncomfortable, nor fasten up my descending hair, the sign of a virginity so recently ruptured that still remained a wounded presence between us. He twined his fingers in my hair until I winced; I said, I remember, very little.

'The maid will have changed our sheets already,' he said. 'We do not hang the bloody sheets out of the window to prove to the whole of Brittany you are a virgin, not in these civilized times. But I should tell you it would have been the first time in all my married lives I could have shown my interested tenants such a flag.'

Then I realized, with a shock of surprise, how it must have been my innocence that captivated him--the silent music, he said, of my unknowingness, like La Terrasse des audiences au clair de lune played upon a piano with keys of ether. You must remember how ill at ease I was in that luxurious place, how unease had been my constant companion during the whole length of my courtship by this grave satyr who now gently martyrized my hair. To know that my naivety gave him some pleasure made me take heart. Courage! I shall act the fine lady to the manner born one day, if only by virtue of default.

Then, slowly yet teasingly, as if he were giving a child a great, mysterious treat, he took out a bunch of keys from some interior hidey-hole in his jacket--key after key, a key, he said, for every lock in the house. Keys of all kinds--huge, ancient things of black iron; others slender, delicate, almost baroque; wafer-thin Yale keys for safes and boxes. And, during his absence, it was I who must take care of them all.

I eyed the heavy bunch with circumspection. Until that moment, I had not given a single thought to the practical aspects of marriage with a great house, great wealth, a great man, whose key ring was as crowded as that of a prison warder. Here were the clumsy and archaic keys for the dungeons, for dungeons we had in plenty although they had been converted to cellars for his wines; the dusty bottles inhabited in racks all those deep holes of pain in the rock on which the castle was built. These are the keys to the kitchens, this is the key to the picture gallery, a treasure house filled by five centuries of avid collectors--ah! he foresaw I would spend hours there.

He had amply indulged his taste for the Symbolists, he told me with a glint of greed. There was Moreau's great portrait of his first wife, the famous Sacrificial Victim with the imprint of the lacelike chains on her pellucid skin. Did I know the story of the painting of that picture? How, when she took off her clothes for him for the first time, she fresh from her bar in Montmartre, she had robed herself involuntarily in a blush that reddened her breasts, her shoulders, her arms, her whole body? He had thought of that story, of that dear girl, when first he had undressed me ... Ensor, the great Ensor, his monolithic canvas: The Foolish Virgins. Two or three late Gauguins, his special favourite the one of the tranced brown girl in the deserted house which was called: Out of the Night We Come, Into the Night We Go. And, besides the additions he had made himself, his marvellous inheritance of Watteaus, Poussins and a pair of very special Fragonards, commissioned for a licentious ancestor who, it was said, had posed for the master's brush himself with his own two daughters ... He broke off his catalogue of treasures abruptly.

Your thin white face, chérie; he said, as if he saw it for the first time. Your thin white face, with its promise of debauchery only a connoisseur could detect.

A log fell in the fire, instigating a shower of sparks; the opal on my finger spurted green flame. I felt as giddy as if I were on the edge of a precipice; I was afraid, not so much of him, of his monstrous presence, heavy as if he had been gifted at birth with more specific gravity than the rest of us, the presence that, even when I thought myself most in love with him, always subtly oppressed me ... No. I was not afraid of him; but of myself. I seemed reborn in his unreflective eyes, reborn in unfamiliar shapes. I hardly recognized myself from his descriptions of me and yet, and yet--might there not be a grain of beastly truth hi them? And, in the red firelight, I blushed again, unnoticed, to think he might have chosen me because, in my innocence, he sensed a rare talent for corruption.

Here is the key to the china cabinet--don't laugh, my darling; there's a king's ransom in Sèvres in that closet, and a queen's ransom in Limoges. And a key to the locked, barred room where five generations of plate were kept.

Keys, keys, keys. He would trust me with the keys to his office, although I was only a baby; and the keys to his safes, where he kept the jewels I should wear, he promised me, when we returned to Paris. Such jewels! Why, I would be able to change my earrings and necklaces three times a day, just as the Empress Josephine used to change her underwear. He doubted, he said, with that hollow, knocking sound that served him for a chuckle, I would be quite so interested in his share certificates although they, of course, were worth infinitely more.

Outside our firelit privacy, I could hear the sound of the tide drawing back from the pebbles of the foreshore; it was nearly time for him to leave me. One single key remained unaccounted for on the ring and he hesitated over it; for a moment, I thought he was going to unfasten it from its brothers, slip it back into his pocket and take it away with him.

'What is that key?' I demanded, for his chaffing had made me bold. 'The key to your heart? Give it me!'

He dangled the key tantalizingly above my head, out of reach of my straining fingers; those bare red lips of his cracked sidelong in a smile.

'Ah, no,' he said. 'Not the key to my heart. Rather, the key to my enfer.'

He left it on the ring, fastened the ring together, shook it musically, like a carillon. Then threw the keys in a jingling heap in my lap. I could feel the cold metal chilling my thighs through my thin muslin frock. He bent over me to drop a beard-masked kiss on my forehead.

'Every man must have one secret, even if only one, from his wife,' he said. 'Promise me this, my whey-faced piano-player; promise me you'll use all the keys on the ring except that last little one I showed you. Play with anything you find, jewels, silver plate; make toy boats of my share certificates, if it pleases you, and send them sailing off to America after me. All is yours, everywhere is open to you--except the lock that this single key fits. Yet all it is is the key to a little room at the foot of the west tower, behind the still-room, at the end of a dark little corridor full of horrid cobwebs that would get into your hair and frighten you if you ventured there. Oh, and you'd find it such a dull little room! But you must promise me, if you love me, to leave it well alone. It is only a private study, a hideaway, a ""den"", as the English say, where I can go, sometimes, on those infrequent yet inevitable occasions when the yoke of marriage seems to weigh too heavily on my shoulders. There I can go, you understand, to savour the rare pleasure of imagining myself wifeless.'

There was a little thin starlight in the courtyard as, wrapped in my furs, I saw him to his car. His last words were, that he had telephoned the mainland and taken a piano-tuner on to the staff; this man would arrive to take up his duties the next day. He pressed me to his vicuña breast, once, and then drove away.

I had drowsed away that afternoon and now I could not sleep. I lay tossing and turning in his ancestral bed until another daybreak discoloured the dozen mirrors that were iridescent with the reflections of the sea. The perfume of the lilies weighed on my senses; when I thought that, henceforth, I would always share these sheets with a man whose skin, as theirs did, contained that toad-like, clammy hint of moisture, I felt a vague desolation that within me, now my female wound had healed, there had awoken a certain queasy craving like the cravings of pregnant women for the taste of coal or chalk or tainted food, for the renewal of his caresses. Had he not hinted to me, in his flesh as in his speech and looks, of the thousand, thousand baroque intersections of flesh upon flesh? I lay in our wide bed accompanied by, a sleepless companion, my dark newborn curiosity.

I lay in bed alone. And I longed for him. And he disgusted me.

Were there jewels enough in all his safes to recompense me for this predicament? Did all that castle hold enough riches to recompense me for the company of the libertine with whom I must share it? And what, precisely, was the nature of my desirous dread for this mysterious being who, to show his mastery over me, had abandoned me on my wedding night?

Then I sat straight up in bed, under the sardonic masks of the gargoyles carved above me, riven by a wild surmise. Might he have left me, not for Wall Street but for an importunate mistress tucked away God knows where who knew how to pleasure him far better than a girl whose fingers had been exercised, hitherto, only by the practice of scales and arpeggios? And, slowly, soothed, I sank back on to the heaping pillows; I acknowledged that the jealous scare I'd just given myself was not unmixed with a little tincture of relief.

At last I drifted into slumber, as daylight filled the room and chased bad dreams away. But the last thing I remembered, before I slept, was the tall jar of lilies beside the bed, how the thick glass distorted their fat stems so they looked like arms, dismembered arms, drifting drowned in greenish water.

Coffee and croissants to console this bridal, solitary waking. Delicious. Honey, too, in a section of comb on a glass saucer. The maid squeezed the aromatic juice from an orange into a chilled goblet while I watched her as I lay in the lazy, midday bed of the rich. Yet nothing, this morning, gave me more than a fleeting pleasure except to hear that the piano-tuner had been at work already. When the maid told me that, I sprang out of bed and pulled on my old serge skirt and flannel blouse, costume of a student, in which I felt far more at ease with myself than in any of my fine new clothes.

After my three hours of practice, I called the piano-tuner in, to thank him. He was blind, of course; but young, with a gentle mouth and grey eyes that fixed upon me although they could not see me. He was a blacksmith's son from the village across the causeway; a chorister in the church whom the good priest had taught a trade so that he could make a living. All most satisfactory. Yes. He thought he would be happy here. And if, he added shyly, he might sometimes be allowed to hear me play ... for, you see, he loved music. Yes. Of course, I said. Certainly. He seemed to know that I had smiled.

After I dismissed him, even though I'd woken so late, it was still barely time for my 'five o'clock'. The housekeeper, who, thoughtfully forewarned by my husband, had restrained herself from interrupting my music, now made me a solemn visitation with a lengthy menu for a late luncheon. When I told her I did not need it, she looked at me obliquely, along her nose. I understood at once that one of my principal functions as chatelaine was to provide work for the staff. But, all the same, I asserted myself and said I would wait until dinner-time, although I looked forward nervously to the solitary meal. Then I found I had to tell her what I would like to have prepared for me; my imagination, still that of a schoolgirl, ran riot. A fowl in cream--or should I anticipate Christmas with a varnished turkey? No; I have decided. Avocado and shrimp, lots of it, followed by no entrée at all. But surprise me for dessert with every ice-cream in the ice box. She noted all down but sniffed; I'd shocked her. Such tastes! Child that I was, I giggled when she left me.

But, now ... what shall I do, now?

I could have spent a happy hour unpacking the trunks that contained my trousseau but the maid had done that already, the dresses, the tailor-mades hung in the wardrobe in my dressing room, the hats on wooden heads to keep their shape, the shoes on wooden feet as if all these inanimate objects were imitating the appearance of life, to mock me. I did not like to linger in my overcrowded dressing room, nor in my lugubriously lily-scented bedroom. How shall I pass the time?

I shall take a bath in my own bathroom! And found the taps were little dolphins made of gold, with chips of turquoise for eyes. And there was a tank of goldfish, who swam in and out of moving fronds of weeds, as bored, I thought, as I was. How I wished he had not left me. How I wished it were possible to chat with, say, a maid; or, the piano-tuner ... but I knew already my new rank forbade overtures of friendship to the staff.

I had been hoping to defer the call as long as I could, so that I should have something to look forward to in the dead waste of time I foresaw before me, after my dinner was done with, but, at a quarter before seven, when darkness already surrounded the castle, I could contain myself no longer. I telephoned my mother. And astonished myself by bursting into tears when I heard her voice.

No, nothing was the matter. Mother, I have gold bath taps.

I said, gold bath taps!

No; I suppose that's nothing to cry about, Mother.

The line was bad, I could hardly make out her congratulations, her questions, her concern, but I was a little comforted when I put the receiver down.

Yet there still remained one whole hour to dinner and the whole, unimaginable desert of the rest of the evening.

The bunch of keys lay, where he had left them, on the rug before the library fire which had warmed their metal so that they no longer felt cold to the touch but warm, almost, as my own skin. How careless I was; a maid, tending the logs, eyed me reproachfully as if I'd set a trap for her as I picked up the clinking bundle of keys, the keys to the interior doors of this lovely prison of which I was both the inmate and the mistress and had scarcely seen. When I remembered that, I felt the exhilaration of the explorer.

Lights! More lights!

At the touch of a switch, the dreaming library was brilliantly illuminated. I ran crazily about the castle, switching on every light I could find--I ordered the servants to light up all their quarters, too, so the castle would shine like a seaborne birthday cake lit with a thousand candles, one for every year of its life, and everybody on shore would wonder at it. When everything was lit as brightly as the café in the Gare du Nord, the significance of the possessions implied by that bunch of keys no longer intimidated me, for I was determined, now, to search through them all for evidence of my husband's true nature. His office first, evidently.

A mahogany desk half a mile wide, with an impeccable blotter and a bank of telephones. I allowed myself the luxury of opening the safe that contained the jewellery and delved sufficiently among the leather boxes to find out how my marriage had given me access to a jinn's treasury--parures, bracelets, rings ... While I was thus surrounded by diamonds, a maid knocked on the door and entered before I spoke; a subtle discourtesy. I would speak to my husband about it. She eyed my serge skirt superciliously; did madame plan to dress for dinner?

She made a moue of disdain when I laughed to hear that, she was far more the lady than I. But, imagine--to dress up in one of my Poiret extravaganzas, with the jewelled turban and aigrette on my head, roped with pearl to the navel, to sit down all alone in the baronial dining hall at the head of that massive board at which King Mark was reputed to have fed his knights ... I grew calmer under the cold eye of her disapproval. I adopted the crisp inflections of an officer's daughter. No, I would not dress for dinner. Furthermore, I was not hungry enough for dinner itself. She must tell the housekeeper to cancel the dormitory feast I'd ordered. Could they leave me sandwiches and a flask of coffee in my music room? And would they all dismiss for the night?

Mais oui, madame.

I knew by her bereft intonation I had let them down again but I did not care; I was armed against them by the brilliance of his hoard. But I would not find his heart amongst the glittering stones; as soon as she had gone, I began a systematic search of the drawers of his desk.

All was in order, so I found nothing. Not a random doodle on an old envelope, nor the faded photograph of a woman. Only the files of business correspondence, the bills from the home farms, the invoices from tailors, the billets-doux from international financiers. Nothing. And this absence of the evidence of his real life began to impress me strangely; there must, I thought, be a great deal to conceal if he takes such pains to hide it.

His office was a singularly impersonal room, facing inwards, on to the courtyard, as though he wanted to turn his back on the siren sea in order to keep a clear head while he bankrupted a small businessman in Amsterdam or--I noticed with a thrill of distaste--engaged in some business in Laos that must, from certain cryptic references to his amateur botanist's enthusiasm for rare poppies, be to do with opium. Was he not rich enough to do without crime? Or was the crime itself his profit? And yet I saw enough to appreciate his zeal for secrecy.

Now I had ransacked his desk, I must spend a cool-headed quarter of an hour putting every last letter back where I had found it, and, as I covered the traces of my visit, by some chance, as I reached inside a little drawer that had stuck fast, I must have touched a hidden spring, for a secret drawer flew open within that drawer itself; and this secret drawer contained--at last!--a file marked: Personal.

I was alone, but for my reflection in the uncurtained window.

I had the brief notion that his heart, pressed flat as a flower, crimson and thin as tissue paper, lay in this file. It was a very thin one.

I could have wished, perhaps, I had not found that touching, ill-spelt note, on a paper napkin marked La Coupole, that began: 'My darling, I cannot wait for the moment when you may make me yours completely.' The diva had sent him a page of the score of Tristan, the Liebestod, with the single, cryptic word: 'Until...' scrawled across it. But the strangest of all these love letters was a postcard with a view of a village graveyard, among mountains, where some black-coated ghoul enthusiastically dug at a grave; this little scene, executed with the lurid exuberance of Grand Guignol, was captioned: 'Typical Transylvanian Scene--Midnight, All Hallows.' And, on the other side, the message: 'On the occasion of this marriage to the descendant of Dracula--always remember, ""the supreme and unique pleasure of love is the certainty that one is doing evil"". Toutes amitiés, C.'

A joke. A joke in the worst possible taste; for had he not been married to a Romanian countess? And then I remembered her pretty, witty face, and her name--Carmilla. My most recent predecessor in this castle had been, it would seem, the most sophisticated.

I put away the file, sobered. Nothing in my life of family love and music had prepared me for these grown-up games and yet these were clues to his self that showed me, at least, how much he had been loved, even if they did not reveal any good reason for it. But I wanted to know still more; and, as I closed the office door and locked it, the means to discover more fell in my way.

Fell, indeed; and with the clatter of a dropped canteen of cutlery, for, as I turned the slick Yale lock, I contrived, somehow, to open up the key ring itself, so that all the keys tumbled loose on the floor. And the very first key I picked out of that pile was, as luck or ill fortune had it, the key to the room he had forbidden me, the room he would keep for his own so that he could go there when he wished to feel himself once more a bachelor.

I made my decision to explore it before I felt a faint resurgence of my ill-defined fear of his waxen stillness. Perhaps I half-imagined, then, that I might find his real self in his den, waiting there to see if indeed I had obeyed him; that he had sent a moving figure of himself to New York, the enigmatic, self-sustaining carapace of his public person, while the real man, whose face I had glimpsed in the storm of orgasm, occupied himself with pressing private business in the study at the foot of the west tower, behind the still-room. Yet, if that were so, it was imperative that I should find him, should know him; and I was too deluded by his apparent taste for me to think my disobedience might truly offend him.

I took the forbidden key from the heap and left the others lying there.

It was now very late and the castle was adrift, as far as it could go from the land, in the middle of the silent ocean where, at my orders, it floated, like a garland of light. And all silent, all still, but for the murmuring of the waves.

I felt no fear, no intimation of dread. Now I walked as firmly as I had done in my mother's house.

Not a narrow, dusty little passage at all; why had he lied to me? But an ill-lit one, certainly; the electricity, for some reason, did not extend here, so I retreated to the still-room and found a bundle of waxed tapers in a cupboard, stored there with matches to light the oak board at grand dinners. I put a match to my little taper and advanced with it in my hand, like a penitent, along the corridor hung with heavy, I think Venetian, tapestries. The flame picked out, here, the head of a man, there, the rich breast of a woman spilling through a rent in her dress--the Rape of the Sabines, perhaps? The naked swords and immolated horses suggested some grisly mythological subject. The corridor wound downwards; there was an almost imperceptible ramp to the thickly carpeted floor. The heavy hangings on the wall muffled my footsteps, even my breathing. For some reason, it grew very warm; the sweat sprang out in beads on my brow. I could no longer hear the sound of the sea.

A long, a winding corridor, as if I were in the viscera of the castle; and this corridor led to a door of worm-eaten oak, low, round-topped, barred with black iron.

And still I felt no fear, no raising of the hairs on the back of the neck, no prickling of the thumbs.

The key slid into the new lock as easily as a hot knife into butter.

No fear; but a hesitation, a holding of the spiritual breath.

If I had found some traces of his heart in a file marked: Personal, perhaps, here, in his subterranean privacy, I might find a little of his soul. It was the consciousness of the possibility of such a discovery, of its possible strangeness, that kept me for a moment motionless, before, in the foolhardiness of my already subtly tainted innocence, I turned the key and the door creaked slowly back.

'There is a striking resemblance between the act of love and the ministrations of a torturer,' opined my husband's favourite poet; I had learned something of the nature of that similarity on my marriage bed. And now my taper showed me the outlines of a rack. There was also a great wheel, like the ones I had seen in woodcuts of the martyrdoms of the saints, in my old nurse's little store of holy books. And--just one glimpse of it before my little flame caved in and I was left in absolute darkness--a metal figure, hinged at the side, which I knew to be spiked on the inside and to have the name: the Iron Maiden.

Absolute darkness. And, about me, the instruments of mutilation.

Until that moment, this spoiled child did not know she had inherited nerves and a will from the mother who had defied the yellow outlaws of Indo-China; My mother's spirit drove me on, into that dreadful place, in a cold ecstasy to know the very worst. I fumbled for the matches in my pocket; what a dim, lugubrious light they gave! And yet, enough, oh, more than enough, to see a room designed for desecration and some dark night of unimaginable lovers whose embraces were annihilation.

The walls of this stark torture chamber were the naked rock; they gleamed as if they were sweating with fright. At the four corners of the room were funerary urns, of great antiquity, Etruscan, perhaps, and, on three-legged ebony stands, the bowls of incense he had left burning which filled the room with a sacerdotal reek. Wheel, rack and Iron Maiden were, I saw, displayed as grandly as if they were items of statuary and I was almost consoled, then, and almost persuaded myself that I might have stumbled only upon a little museum of his perversity, that he had installed these monstrous items here only for contemplation.

Yet at the centre of the room lay a catafalque, a doomed, ominous bier of Renaissance workmanship, surrounded by long white candles and, at its foot, an armful of the same lilies with which he had filled my bedroom, stowed in a four-foot-high jar glazed with a sombre Chinese red. I scarcely dared examine this catafalque and its occupant more closely; yet I knew I must.

Each time I struck a match to light those candles round her bed, it seemed a garment of that innocence of mine for which he had lusted fell away from me.

The opera singer lay, quite naked, under a thin sheet of very rare and precious linen, such as the princes of Italy used to shroud those whom they had poisoned. I touched her, very gently, on the white breast; she was cool, he had embalmed her. On her throat I could see the blue imprint of his strangler's fingers. The cool, sad flame of the candles flickered on her white, closed eyelids. The worst thing was, the dead lips smiled.

Beyond the catafalque, in the middle of the shadows, a white, nacreous glimmer; as my eyes accustomed themselves to the gathering darkness, I at last--oh, horrors!--made out a skull; yes, a skull, so utterly denuded, now, of flesh, that it scarcely seemed possible the stark bone had once been richly upholstered with life. And this skull was strung up by a system of unseen cords, so that it appeared to hang, disembodied, in the still, heavy air, and it had been crowned with a wreath of white roses, and a veil of lace, the final image of his bride.

Yet the skull was still so beautiful, had shaped with its sheer planes so imperiously the face that had once existed above it, that I recognized her the moment I saw her; face of the evening star walking on the rim of night. One false step, oh, my poor, dear girl, next in the fated sisterhood of his wives; one false step and into the abyss of the dark you stumbled.

And where was she, the latest dead, the Romanian countess who might have thought her blood would survive his depredations? I knew she must be here, in the place that had wound me through the castle towards it on a spool of inexorability. But, at first, I could see no sign of her. Then, for some reason--perhaps some change of atmosphere wrought by my presence--the metal shell of the Iron Maiden emitted a ghostly twang; my feverish imagination might have guessed its occupant was trying to clamber out, though, even in the midst of my rising hysteria, I knew she must be dead to find a home there.

With trembling fingers, I prised open the front of the upright coffin, with its sculpted face caught in a rictus of pain. Then, overcome, I dropped the key I still held in my other hand. It dropped into the forming pool of her blood.

She was pierced, not by one but by a hundred spikes, this child of the land of the vampires who seemed so newly dead, so full of blood ... oh God! how recently had he become a widower? How long had he kept her in this obscene cell? Had it been all the time he had courted me, in the clear light of Paris?

I closed the lid of her coffin very gently and burst into a tumult of sobbing that contained both pity for his other victims and also a dreadful anguish to know I, too, was one of them.

The candles flared, as if in a draught from a door to elsewhere. The light caught the fire opal on my hand so that it flashed, once, with a baleful light, as if to tell me the eye of God--his eye--was upon me. My first thought, when I saw the ring for which I had sold myself to this fate, was, how to escape it.

I retained sufficient presence of mind to snuff out the candles round the bier with my fingers, to gather up my taper, to look around, although shuddering, to ensure I had left behind me no traces of my visit.

I retrieved the key from the pool of blood, wrapped it in my handkerchief to keep my hands clean, and fled the room, slamming the door behind me. It crashed to with a juddering reverberation, like the door of hell.

I could not take refuge in my bedroom, for that retained the memory of his presence trapped in the fathomless silvering of his mirrors. My music room seemed the safest place, although I looked at the picture of Saint Cecilia with a faint dread; what had been the nature of her martyrdom? My mind was in a tumult; schemes for flight jostled with one another ... as soon as the tide receded from the causeway, I would make for the mainland--on foot, running, stumbling; I did not trust that leather-clad chauffeur, nor the well-behaved housekeeper, and I dared not take any of the pale, ghostly maids into my confidence, either, since they were his creatures, all. Once at the village, I would fling myself directly on the mercy of the gendarmerie.

But--could I trust them, either? His forefathers had ruled this coast for eight centuries, from this castle whose moat was the Atlantic. Might not the police, the advocates, even the judge, all be in his service, turning a common blind eye to his vices since he was milord whose word must be obeyed? Who, on this distant coast, would believe the white-faced girl from Paris who came running to them with a shuddering tale of blood, of fear, of the ogre murmuring in the shadows? Or, rather, they would immediately know it to be true. But were all honour-bound to let me carry it no further.

Assistance. My mother. I ran to the telephone; and the line, of course, was dead.

Dead as his wives.

A thick darkness, unlit by any star, still glazed the windows. Every lamp in my room burned, to keep the dark outside, yet it seemed still to encroach on me, to be present beside me but as if masked by my lights, the night like a permeable substance that could seep into my skin. I looked at the precious little clock made from hypocritically innocent flowers long ago, in Dresden; the hands had scarcely moved one single hour forward from when I first descended to that private slaughterhouse of his. Time was his servant, too; it would trap me, here, in a night that would last until he came back to me, like a black sun on a hopeless morning.

And yet the time might still be my friend; at that hour, that very hour, he set sail for New York.

To know that, in a few moments, my husband would have left France calmed my agitation a little. My reason told me I had nothing to fear; the tide that would take him away to the New World would let me out of the imprisonment of the castle. Surely I could easily evade the servants. Anybody can buy a ticket at a railway station. Yet I was still rilled with unease. I opened the lid of the piano; perhaps I thought my own particular magic might help me, now, that I could create a pentacle out of music that would keep me from harm for, if my music had first ensnared him, then might it not also give me the power to free myself from him?

Mechanically, I began to play but my fingers were stiff and shaking. At first, I could manage nothing better than the exercises of Czerny but simply the act of playing soothed me and, for solace, for the sake of the harmonious rationality of its sublime mathematics, I searched among his scores until I found The Well-Tempered Clavier. I set myself the therapeutic task of playing all Bach's equations, every one, and, I told myself, if I played them all through without a single mistake--then the morning would find me once more a virgin.

Crash of a dropped stick.

His silver-headed cane! What else? Sly, cunning, he had returned; he was waiting for me outside the door!

I rose to my feet; fear gave me strength. I flung back my head defiantly.

'Come in!' My voice astonished me by its firmness, its clarity.

The door slowly, nervously opened and I saw, not the massive, irredeemable bulk of my husband but the slight, stooping figure of the piano-tuner, and he looked far more terrified of me than my mother's daughter would have been of the Devil himself. In the torture chamber, it seemed to me that I would never laugh again; now, helplessly, laugh I did, with relief, and, after a moment's hesitation, the boy's face softened and he smiled a little, almost in shame. Though they were blind, his eyes were singularly sweet.

'Forgive me,' said Jean-Yves. 'I know I've given you grounds for dismissing me, that I should be crouching outside your door at midnight ... but I heard you walking about, up and down--I sleep in a room at the foot of the west tower--and some intuition told me you could not sleep and might, perhaps, pass the insomniac hours at your piano. And I could not resist that. Besides, I stumbled over these--'

And he displayed the ring of keys I'd dropped outside my husband's office door, the ring from which one key was missing. I took them from him, looked round for a place to stow them, fixed on the piano stool as if to hide them would protect me. Still he stood smiling at me. How hard it was to make everyday conversation.

'It's perfect,' I said. 'The piano. Perfectly in tune.'

But he was full of the loquacity of embarrassment, as though I would only forgive him for his impudence if he explained the cause of it thoroughly.

'When I heard you play this afternoon, I thought I'd never heard such a touch. Such technique. A treat for me, to hear a virtuoso! So I crept up to your door now, humbly as a little dog might, madame, and put my ear to the keyhole and listened, and listened--until my stick fell to the floor through a momentary clumsiness of mine, and I was discovered.'

He had the most touchingly ingenuous smile.

'Perfectly in tune,' I repeated. To my surprise, now I had said it, I found I could not say anything else. I could only repeat: 'In tune ... perfect ... in tune,' over and over again. I saw a dawning surprise in his face. My head throbbed. To see him, in his lovely, blind humanity, seemed to hurt me very piercingly, somewhere inside my breast; his figure blurred, the room swayed about me. After the dreadful revelation of that bloody chamber, it was his tender look that made me faint.

When I recovered consciousness, I found I was lying in the piano-tuner's arms and he was tucking the satin cushion from the piano-stool under my head.

'You are in some great distress,' he said. 'No bride should suffer so much, so early in her marriage.'

His speech had the rhythms of the countryside, the rhythms of the tides.

'Any bride brought to this castle should come ready dressed in mourning, should bring a priest and a coffin with her,' I said.

'What's this?'

It was too late to keep silent; and if he, too, were one of my husband's creatures, then at least he had been kind to me. So I told him everything, the keys, the interdiction, my disobedience, the room, the rack, the skull, the corpses, the blood.

'I can scarcely believe it,' he said, wondering. 'That man ... so rich; so well-born.'

'Here's proof,' I said and tumbled the fatal key out of my handkerchief on to the silken rug.

'Oh God,' he said. 'I can smell the blood.'

He took my hand; he pressed his arms about me. Although he was scarcely more than a boy, I felt a great strength flow into me from his touch.

'We whisper all manner of strange tales up and down the coast,' he said.' There was a Marquis, once, who used to hunt young girls on the mainland; he hunted them with dogs, as though they were foxes. My grandfather had it from his grandfather, how the Marquis pulled a head out of his saddle bag and showed it to the blacksmith while the man was shoeing his horse. ""A fine specimen of the genus, brunette, eh, Guillaume?"" And it was the head of the blacksmith's wife.'

But, in these more democratic times, my husband must travel as far as Paris to do his hunting in the salons. Jean-Yves knew the moment I shuddered.

'Oh, madame! I thought all these were old wives' tales, chattering of fools, spooks to scare bad children into good behaviour! Yet how could you know, a stranger, that the old name for this place is the Castle of Murder?'

How could I know, indeed? Except that, in my heart, I'd always known its lord would be the death of me.

'Hark!' said my friend suddenly. 'The sea has changed key; it must be near morning, the tide is going down.'

He helped me up. I looked from the window, towards the mainland, along the causeway where the stones gleamed wetly in the thin light of the end of the night and, with an almost unimaginable horror, a horror the intensity of which I cannot transmit to you, I saw, in the distance, still far away yet drawing moment by moment inexorably nearer, the twin headlamps of his great black car, gouging tunnels through the shifting mist.

My husband had indeed returned; this time, it was no fancy.

'The key!' said Jean-Yves. 'It must go back on the ring, with the others. As though nothing had happened.'

But the key was still caked with wet blood and I ran to my bathroom and held it under the hot tap. Crimson water swirled down the basin but, as if the key itself were hurt, the bloody token stuck. The turquoise eyes of the dolphin taps winked at me derisively; they knew my husband had been too clever for me! I scrubbed the stain with my nail brush but still it would not budge. I thought how the car would be rolling silently towards the closed courtyard gate; the more I scrubbed the key, the more vivid grew the stain.

The bell in the gatehouse would jangle. The porter's drowsy son would push back the patchwork quilt, yawning, pull the shirt over his head, thrust his feet into his sabots ... slowly, slowly; open the door for your master as slowly as you can ...

And still the bloodstain mocked the fresh water that spilled from the mouth of the leering dolphin.

'You have no more time,' said Jean-Yves. 'He is here. I know it. I must stay with you.'

'You shall not!' I said. 'Go back to your room, now. Please.'

He hesitated. I put an edge of steel in my voice, for I knew I must meet my lord alone.

'Leave me!'

As soon as he had gone, I dealt with the keys and went to my bedroom. The causeway was empty; Jean-Yves was correct, my husband had already entered the castle. I pulled the curtains close, stripped off my clothes and pulled the bedcurtains round me as a pungent aroma of Russian leather assured me my husband was once again beside me.

'Dearest!'

With the most treacherous, lascivious tenderness, he kissed my eyes, and, mimicking the new bride newly wakened, I flung my arms around him, for on my seeming acquiescence depended my salvation.

'Da Silva of Rio outwitted me,' he said wryly.' My New York agent telegraphed Le Havre and saved me a wasted journey. So we may resume our interrupted pleasures, my love.'

I did not believe one word of it. I knew I had behaved exactly according to his desires; had he not bought me so that I should do so? I had been tricked into my own betrayal to that illimitable darkness whose source I had been compelled to seek in his absence and, now that I had met that shadowed reality of his that came to life only in the presence of its own atrocities, I must pay the price of my new knowledge. The secret of Pandora's box; but he had given me the box, himself, knowing I must learn the secret. I had played a game in which every move was governed by a destiny as oppressive and omnipotent as himself, since that destiny was himself; and I had lost. Lost at that charade of innocence and vice in which he had engaged me. Lost, as the victim loses to the executioner.

His hand brushed my breast, beneath the sheet. I strained my nerves yet could not help but flinch from the intimate touch, for it made me think of the piercing embrace of the Iron Maiden and of his lost lovers in the vault. When he saw my reluctance, his eyes veiled over and yet his appetite did not diminish. His tongue ran over red lips already wet. Silent, mysterious, he moved away from me to draw off his jacket. He took the gold watch from his waistcoat and laid it on the dressing table, like a good bourgeois; scooped out his raiding loose change and now--oh God!--makes a great play of patting his pockets officiously, puzzled lips pursed, searching for something that has been mislaid. Then turns to me with a ghastly, a triumphant smile.

'But of course! I gave the keys to you!'

'Your keys? Why, of course. Here, they're under the pillow; wait a moment--what--Ah! No ... now, where can I have left them? I was whiling away the evening without you at the piano, I remember. Of course! The music room!'

Brusquely he flung my négligé of antique lace on the bed.

'Go and get them.'

'Now? This moment? Can't it wait until morning, my darling?'

I forced myself to be seductive. I saw myself, pale, pliant as a plant that begs to be trampled underfoot, a dozen vulnerable, appealing girls reflected in as many mirrors, and I saw how he almost failed to resist me. If he had come to me in bed, I would have strangled him, then.

But he half-snarled: 'No. It won't wait. Now.'

The unearthly light of dawn filled the room; had only one previous dawn broken upon me in that vile place? And there was nothing for it but to go and fetch the keys from the music stool and pray he would not examine them too closely, pray to God his eyes would fail him, that he might be struck blind.

When I came back into the bedroom carrying the bunch of keys that jangled at every step like a curious musical instrument, he was sitting on the bed in his immaculate shirtsleeves, his head sunk in his hands.

And it seemed to me he was in despair.

Strange. In spite of my fear of him, that made me whiter than my wrap, I felt there emanate from him, at that moment, a stench of absolute despair, rank and ghastly, as if the lilies that surrounded him had all at once begun to fester, or the Russian leather of his scent were reverting to the elements of flayed hide and excrement of which it was composed. The chthonic gravity of his presence exerted a tremendous pressure on the room, so that the blood pounded in my ears as if we had been precipitated to the bottom of the sea, beneath the waves that pounded against the shore.

I held my life in my hands amongst those keys and, in a moment, would place it between his well-manicured fingers. The evidence of that bloody chamber had showed me I could expect no mercy. Yet, when he raised his head and stared at me with his blind, shuttered eyes as though he did not recognize me, I felt a terrified pity for him, for this man who lived in such strange, secret places that, if I loved him enough to follow him, I should have to die.

The atrocious loneliness of that monster!

The monocle had fallen from his face. His curling mane was disordered, as if he had run his hands through it in his distraction. I saw how he had lost his impassivity and was now filled with suppressed excitement. The hand he stretched out for those counters in his game of love and death shook a little; the face that turned towards me contained a sombre delirium that seemed to me compounded of a ghastly, yes, shame but also of a terrible, guilty joy as he slowly ascertained how I had sinned.

That tell-tale stain had resolved itself into a mark the shape and brilliance of the heart on a playing card. He disengaged the key from the ring and looked at it for a while, solitary, brooding.

'It is the key that leads to the kingdom of the unimaginable,' he said. His voice was low and had in it the timbre of certain great cathedral organs that seem, when they are played, to be conversing with God.

I could not restrain a sob.

'Oh, my love, my little love who brought me a white gift of music,' he said, almost as if grieving. 'My little love, you'll never know how much I hate daylight!""

Then he sharply ordered: 'Kneel!'

I knelt before him and he pressed the key lightly to my forehead, held it there for a moment. I felt a faint tingling of the skin and, when I involuntarily glanced at myself in the mirror, I saw the heart-shaped stain had transferred itself to my forehead, to the space between the eyebrows, like the caste mark of a brahmin woman. Or the mark of Cain. And now the key gleamed as freshly as if it had just been cut. He clipped it back on the ring, emitting that same, heavy sigh as he had done when I said that I would marry him.

'My virgin of the arpeggios, prepare yourself for martyrdom.'

'What form shall it take?' I said.

'Decapitation,' he whispered, almost voluptuously. 'Go and bathe yourself; put on that white dress you wore to hear Tristan and the necklace that prefigures your end. And I shall take myself off to the armoury, my dear, to sharpen my great-grandfather's ceremonial sword.'

'The servants?'

'We shall have absolute privacy for our last rites; I have already dismissed them. If you look out of the window you can see them going to the mainland.'

It was now the full, pale light of morning; the weather was grey, indeterminate, the sea had an oily, sinister look, a gloomy day on which to die. Along the causeway I could see trouping every maid and scullion, every pot-boy and pan-scourer, valet, laundress and vassal who worked in that great house, most on foot, a few on bicycles. The faceless housekeeper trudged along with a great basket in which, I guessed, she'd stowed as much as she could ransack from the larder. The Marquis must have given the chauffeur leave to borrow the motor for the day, for it went last of all, at a stately pace, as though the procession were a cortege and the car already bore my coffin to the mainland for. burial.

But I knew no good Breton earth would cover me, like a last, faithful lover; I had another fate.

'I have given them all a day's holiday, to celebrate our wedding,' he said. And smiled.

However hard I stared at the receding company, I could see no sign of Jean-Yves, our latest servant, hired but the preceding morning.

'Go, now. Bathe yourself; dress yourself. The lustratory ritual and the ceremonial robing; after that, the sacrifice. Wait in the music room until I telephone for you. No, my dear!' And he smiled, as I started, recalling the line was dead.' One may call inside the castle just as much as one pleases; but, outside--never.'

I scrubbed my forehead with the nail brush as I had scrubbed the key but this red mark would not go away, either, no matter what I did, and I knew I should wear it until I died, though that would not be long. Then I went to my dressing room and put on that white muslin shift, costume of a victim of an auto-da-fé, he had bought me to listen to the Liebestod in. Twelve young women combed out twelve listless sheaves of brown hair in the mirrors; soon, there would be none. The mass of lilies that surrounded me exhaled, now, the odour of their withering. They looked like the trumpets of the angels of death.

On the dressing table, coiled like a snake about to strike, lay the ruby choker.

Already almost lifeless, cold at heart, I descended the spiral staircase to the music room but there I found I had not been abandoned.

'I can be of some comfort to you,' the boy said.' Though not much use.'

We pushed the piano stool in front of the open window so that, for as long as I could, I would be able to smell the ancient, reconciling smell of the sea that, in time, will cleanse everything, scour the old bones white, wash away all the stains. The last little chambermaid had trotted along the causeway long ago and now the tide, fated as I, came tumbling in, the crisp wavelets splashing on the old stones.

'You do not deserve this,' he said.

'Who can say what I deserve or no?' I said. 'I've done nothing; but that may be sufficient reason for condemning me.'

'You disobeyed him,' he said. 'That is sufficient reason for him to punish you.'

'I only did what he knew I would.'

'Like Eve,' he said.

The telephone rang a shrill imperative. Let it ring. But my lover lifted me up and set me on my feet; I knew I must answer it. The receiver felt heavy as earth.

'The courtyard. Immediately.'

My lover kissed me, he took my hand. He would come with me if I would lead him. Courage. When I thought of courage, I thought of my mother. Then I saw a muscle in my lover's face quiver.

'Hoofbeats!' he said.

I cast one last, desperate glance from the window and, like a miracle, I saw a horse and rider galloping at a vertiginous speed along the causeway, though the waves crashed, now, high as the horse's fetlocks. A rider, her black skirts tucked up around her waist so she could ride hard and fast, a crazy, magnificent horsewoman in widow's weeds.

As the telephone rang again.

'Am I to wait all morning?'

Every moment, my mother drew nearer.

'She will be too late,' Jean-Yves said and yet he could not restrain a note of hope that, though it must be so, yet it might not be so.

The third, intransigent call.

'Shall I come up to heaven to fetch you down, Saint Cecilia? You wicked woman, do you wish me to compound my crimes by desecrating the marriage bed?'

So I must go to the courtyard where my husband waited in his London-tailored trousers and the shirt from Turnbull and Asser, beside the mounting block, with, in his hand, the sword which his great-grandfather had presented to the little corporal, in token of surrender to the Republic, before he shot himself. The heavy sword, unsheathed, grey as that November morning, sharp as childbirth, mortal.

When my husband saw my companion, he observed: 'Let the blind lead the blind, eh? But does even a youth as besotted as you are think she was truly blind to her own desires when she took my ring? Give it me back, whore.'

The fires in the opal had all died down. I gladly slipped it from my finger and, even in that dolorous place, my heart was lighter for the lack of it. My husband took it lovingly and lodged it on the tip of his little finger; it would go no further.

'It will serve me for a dozen more fiancées,' he said. 'To the block, woman. No--leave the boy; I shall deal with him later, utilizing a less exalted instrument than the one with which I do my wife the honour of her immolation, for do not fear that in death you will be divided.'

Slowly, slowly, one foot before the other, I crossed the cobbles. The longer I dawdled over my execution, the more time it gave the avenging angel to descend ...

'Don't loiter, girl! Do you think I shall lose appetite for the meal if you are so long about serving it? No; I shall grow hungrier, more ravenous with each moment, more cruel ... Run to me, run! I have a place prepared for your exquisite corpse in my display of flesh!'

He raised the sword and cut bright segments from the air with it, but still I lingered although my hopes, so recently raised, now began to flag. If she is not here by now, her horse must have stumbled on the causeway, have plunged into the sea ... One thing only made me glad; that my lover would not see me die.

My husband laid my branded forehead on the stone and, as he had done once before, twisted my hair into a rope and drew it away from my neck.

'Such a pretty neck,' he said with what seemed to be a genuine, retrospective tenderness. 'A neck like the stem of a young plant.'

I felt the silken bristle of his beard and the wet touch of his lips as he kissed my nape. And, once again, of my apparel I must retain only my gems; the sharp blade ripped my dress in two and it fell from me. A little green moss, growing in the crevices of the mounting block, would be the last thing I should see in all the world.

The whizz of that heavy sword.

And--a great battering and pounding at the gate, the jangling of the bell, the frenzied neighing of a horse! The unholy silence of the place shattered in an instant. The blade did not descend, the necklace did not sever, my head did not roll. For, for an instant, the beast wavered in his stroke, a sufficient split second of astonished indecision to let me spring upright and dart to the assistance of my lover as he struggled sightlessly with the great bolts that kept her out.

The Marquis stood transfixed, utterly dazed, at a loss. It must have been as if he had been watching his beloved Tristan for the twelfth, the thirteenth time and Tristan stirred, then leapt from his bier in the last act, announced in a jaunty aria interposed from Verdi that bygones were bygones, crying over spilt milk did nobody any good and, as for himself, he proposed to live happily ever after. The puppet master, open-mouthed, wide-eyed, impotent at the last, saw his dolls break free of their strings, abandon the rituals he had ordained for them since time began and start to live for themselves; the king, aghast, witnesses the revolt of his pawns.

You never saw such a wild thing as my mother, her hat seized by the winds and blown out to sea so that her hair was her white mane, her black lisle legs exposed to the thigh, her skirts tucked round her waist, one hand on the reins of the rearing horse while the other clasped my father's service revolver and, behind her, the breakers of the savage, indifferent sea, like the witnesses of a furious justice. And my husband stood stock-still, as if she had been Medusa, the sword still raised over his head as in those clockwork tableaux of Bluebeard that you see in glass cases at fairs.

And then it was as though a curious child pushed his centime into the slot and set all in motion. The heavy, bearded figure roared out aloud, braying with fury, and, wielding the honourable sword as if it were a matter of death or glory, charged us, all three.

On her eighteenth birthday, my mother had disposed of a man-eating tiger that had ravaged the villages in the hills north of Hanoi. Now, without a moment's hesitation, she raised my father's gun, took aim and put a single, irreproachable bullet through my husband's head.

We lead a quiet life, the three of us. I inherited, of course, enormous wealth but we have given most of it away to various charities. The castle is now a school for the blind, though I pray that the children who live there are not haunted by any sad ghosts looking for, crying for, the husband who will never return to the bloody chamber, the contents of which are buried or burned, the door sealed.

I felt I had a right to retain sufficient funds to start a little music school here, on the outskirts of Paris, and we do well enough. Sometimes we can even afford to go to the Opéra, though never to sit in a box, of course. We know we are the source of many whisperings and much gossip but the three of us know the truth of it and mere chatter can never harm us. I can only bless the--what shall I call it?--the maternal telepathy that sent my mother running headlong from the telephone to the station after I had called her, that night. I never heard you cry before, she said, by way of explanation. Not when you were happy. And who ever cried because of gold bath taps?

The night train, the one I had taken; she lay in her berth, sleepless as I had been. When she could not find a taxi at that lonely halt, she borrowed old Dobbin from a bemused farmer, for some internal urgency told her that she must reach me before the incoming tide sealed me away from her for ever. My poor old nurse, left scandalized at home--what? interrupt milord on his honeymoon?--she died soon after. She had taken so much secret pleasure in the fact that her little girl had become a marquise; and now here I was, scarcely a penny the richer, widowed at seventeen in the most dubious circumstances and busily engaged in setting up house with a piano-tuner. Poor thing, she passed away in a sorry state of disillusion! But I do believe my mother loves him as much as I do.

No paint nor powder, no matter how thick or white, can mask that red mark on my forehead; I am glad he cannot see it--not for fear of his revulsion, since I know he sees me clearly with his heart--but, because it spares my shame.",Angela Carter,1994,"[100, 93, 97]",3

When she woke up late in the morning light

She's going to get you

[Intro]
It's motherfuckin' Game time!

[Verse: Game]
Six pounds of chronic on my grandma coffee table
That's how you remember it? That's how I remember it
Yeah, dip into the liquor store, nine in my khakis
Crips tryna get at me, my red Impala bumping like acne
My city a trap me; been shot, robbed, stabbed, chased home, socked out
Jabbed by esse's, cops, degenerate niggas with rags
Disintegrate niggas when enemy, dome shots like Kennedy
Slugs drippin' with Hennessey, got murderous tendencies
And if you don't know where the fuck they got me from
Martin Scorsese when I pull out my gun
Scarface, car chase, tell me how your blood taste
Ask your baby mama, she'll tell you how a Blood taste
Basket case, still I'm back with Dre, wait I never left
Run up in Beats, ""Bitch pass the safe! Compton""
Produced by a billion in this motherfucker
Still smokin', Dre we need a ceilin' in this motherfucker
Compton! They killin' in this motherfucker
They grillin' in this motherfucker
Lock the door, they stealin' in this motherfucker
No chains, no rings, this my home
Nigga, this Hub City, no-fly zone
Niggas pull out burners
Start breakin' like Turbo on Ozone
Crack fiends on the back streets
Where the tracks lean, where the needles lay
And switchblades, if you bitch made
Put chili all on your Frito Lay's
Where we dream of Montego Bay
But all we got is the swap meet
Where the cops meet, go bang bang
Leaves blood stains on that concrete
And I'm the only nigga bumpin' Mobb Deep
'Cause I mob deep down that side street
'Cause I'm a West side rider, live with gats on collars
Don't hate me, better get your dollars
I be on Rosecrans with a Glock in both hands
Leanin' on that Brougham
Flamed up like a Coke can with my name on it

[Outro: Asia Bryant]
Another day in Compton, the thrill is high
Know somebody's watchin', but I don't know why
Feel the fire burnin', it touches the sky
Feel 'em coming at you, I won't die tonight

Well I'm on, so on, I'm a sweet black birdie
'Cause I'm rockin' the sign called Sagittarius
And I'm on, so on, 'cause I know my stuff
And I go by the sign of a Libra
Well I'm on, I'm on, I'm on the go
I'm the sexy sign they call Scorpio
Well I'm five-foot two and I'm five-foot three
Hey, what do you know, I'm five-foot four
We're not Con Funk Shun, we're not the Gap
But we're the Sugar Hill girls with the gangster rap
And we're not the Chic or the Sugarhill
We're The Sequence girls with the gangster thrill
We're three of a kind and we're lots of fun
As The Sequence girls we're number one

I'm Cheryl The Pearl and I'm ready to go
I'm gonna shock the house like Kurtis Blow
I came to Earth to freakin' make you groove
'Cause all I wanna do is see your body move
Like Magic Johnson, young Casanova Fly
Hittin' 42 points with tears in his eyes
MVP 'cause he rocked the game
And now his name'll go down in the Hall of Fame
I went back to heaven when I got the news
All the people on Earth was hip to my groove
I came back down and shocked the world
'Cause I'm better known as the Wonder Girl
Like a [?] house, shoot 'em up, have you and guards?
I'm the deputy of love and they call me number one
Bah-bah black sheep, have you any land?
I'm Cheryl The Pearl, I rock Superman
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, which way you wanna go?

I'm walkin' down the street in a neighborhood
All the fellas say lady you know you look good
'Cause you're vicious and you're right on time
The frame of your body just blew my mind
It's Angie B, the chocolate star
And I taste a little sweeter than the Hersey bar
Go on, so on, I'm a sweet black berry
'Cause I'm rockin the sign called Sagittarius
To express myself and let you know
I'm a vicious lady from head to toe
Well my hat is new with my pretty face
My shining eyes are right in place
My luscious arms, oh so smooth
And my knee, waist, to help my hips to groove
Well my thighs are on, my legs are knee deep
You should see me tip on my tender feet
I rock you high and rock you well
I rock you better than Southern Bell
When I say ring, ding, dong
Come on Blondie get on the microphone!
Ring, ding, dong (Hit it!)

[Verse 4: Blondie]
And then, of course it's me
A devastating queen of the mic you see
I was once mistaken as Goldie Locks
To make all you fellas feel real hot
I'll rock with you and you'll rock with me
And we'll both rock until the break of d
You see I am sweet as can be
To make all the fellas real easy
'Cause when I start to talk my stuff
I talk until you don't get enough
I'm a double-stacked burger with lots of meat
You can check me out from head to feet
I said I rock on the mic with my gangster voice
I can't help it, can't help it, 'cause I have no choice
I said I talk more noise than Howard Cosell
I talk it like that to make the fellas yell
Bonjour (Bonjour) Sasoon (Sasoon)
I like to see the fellas swoon
So neat, so petite
I'm sure you find me oh so sweet

288,"Play My Funk (From ""Sugar Hill"")","Rhyming to the dope beat, straight from the heart
Rough, rugged poetry that goes hard
When I get my muse you got flava in ya ear
That hits you like a 40 oz and not like a beer.
Fear, I feel when my thoughts choke
That goes away when I puff the smoke
Got bags for days across the river from my man
Don't you ever phase, I'm just the biggest fan
Save bills and coins, whatever I find
Set up a rendevouz to get my dime
And you know it's all gravy
When I get good game and my man don't play me
I don't pull strings and such
And I like my spacecakes with a little bit of fudge
My personal cook is Martha Stewart
Everything I inhale is not laced and cured.

Click clack goes the machine gun funk
Making every girl move her trunk
Old school, new school, I don't know where I'm at
Just dont associate me with that fucking swag
I don't give a fuck if you're a five or a six,
As long as I'm delivering my hip hop fix
Sticks and stones may break your bones
Hey, it's just a diss - don't you call no phones
Protect ya neck, that goes out for you too
Lyrical killing in the style of the Wu
I'mma get yo faggy jacket and steal yo kicks
The only thing that keeps you
Getting dumbass chicks
Don't play me no tricks, I know the whole
Repertoire
Having Supras don't make you a superstar
My mad flow brings
You the jeepers
I rap for the idea and not for the figures.

So behave grasshoper, check my flow
The criminal lyrics that make you scream
Five-Oh
The minimal skills to drop an album next fall
And if you ain't down - you reap what you sow
The hallmark of your rap is mass apeal
Real recognize real, fuck the dollar
Bill.
Develop your skill, take something to chill
And go back in time to the people of Sugar Hill.
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast
But I'm good as butter on your
Breakfast toast
Words of wisdom from the old school cats
Living in the past, got Kool Herc
Sets
Blazing that indo, cheating on tests
Rhyming so deadly I make you wear vests
I can be the whitest guest on Letterman
Or be Frank Lucas' top salesman.
I can even be charged with lyrical murder
I can even sell Rick Ross a motherfuckin' burger

Every time that we meet
We skip and we dip to the beat

He's gonna tip by her window
Cause he sure wants to get out and dance

Let 'em all in
The chandelier downstairs has fallen
I know it's hard to resist
This is the party no one wanted to miss

But if you don't get home on the double, boy
You're going to be in trouble
I hope your mama don't look in your room
'Cause if she does
She'll be here soon

And you've got it bad, boy
Boy, say goodbye to your friends

[Verse 1]
No way, you'll never make it
Come with the weak shit, I'll break it
Step into my zone, mad rhymes will stifle ya
Lines like rifles go blast when I kick some ass
A lot of rappers be like one-time wonders
Couldn't say a fly rhyme if there was one right under, their noses
I hate those motherfuckin' posers
But I'm so real, to them it's scary
And with my unique skills, nah, you can't compare me
And no, we don't make wack tracks
And all the suckers get pushed back when I'm kickin' real facts
I represent, set up shit like a tent, boy
You're paranoid 'cause you're a son like Elroy
And you'd be happy as hell to get a record deal
Maybe your soul you'd sell to have mass appeal

Give me room, please
I be like fascinatin' when I be updatin'
Cuttin' off wack kids, pullin' their trump cards
I thump hard, and make 'em say that I'm God
Niggas be pretendin' they're hardcore
Never know the meanin' of (raw)
But I get props like a slogan
And no man could ever try to diss when I kicks my jam
Lyrically def and connectin', complete mic-wreckin'
No double-checkin', vocals kill like weapons
But if I have to, I go all out with no mic
Yeah, that's right, cause I survived mad fights
And for my peeps I truly care
Cause without some of them I wouldn't be here
And they all know how I feel

Check one two and you don't stop
Your head'll bop when I drop my crop of pure bomb
Just like the seashore, I'm calm
But wild, with my monotone style
Because I don't need gimmicks
Gimme a fly beat and I'm all in it
Word is bond, I go on and on
For you it's tragic, I got magic like wands

Relax yourself girl, please settle down
Relax yourself girl, please settle down
Relax yourself girl, please settle down
Relax yourself girl

When my eye caught onto you, I didn't know what to do
That never happens, it was a little unusual
From your queen crown to your root you stood so beautiful
And at the time keeping some distance was only suitable
Everyone was tryna get their foot in
Like babysteps I rather have the right footing, with no cushion
This joint you'll have to bring the kush in
I don't wanna push it
But I see something in you compared to other women
It's that natural light that you illuminate
Taking you out, I wouldn't dare to hesitate
Whatever goes down we ain't gotta say shit
Lets go on a quest and vibe, electric relaxation

Please settle down

Relax yourself girl, please settle down
Relax yourself girl

Relax yourself girl, please settle down
Relax yourself girl, please saddle down
Relax yourself girl

(Verse)

I can be your Superman and you can be my Lois Lane
We can meditate and travel through the astral planes
You keep yourself well, main tamed
And your heart maintained from all of these love games
Lemme whisper something in your ear and give you neck kisses
You can't hold back your precipitation like those Nimbuses
I ain't gotta win what's within your chest with jewels and necklaces
So I guess that's safe to show how real this is
Your essence reminds me of blooming Tulips
Lemme show you where the tool is and taste those two lips
I can read your hidden emotions without a mood ring
So girl, can I hit it in the morning?
I know me asking might've been a little absurd
And you don't wanna risk your feelings getting hurt
I guess the last dude did you wrong and kicked you to the curb
And you're afraid of another one treating you like dirt
Never that, we should just let our roots merge
Cause you're holding in your sexual urge",JAY RUKAS,1994,"[98, 81, 70, 74, 68, 69, 65, 68, 76]",9

But everything is my decision, to be honest, I'm grown
But shit is cool, I'm doin' better than I used to
Ain't been around no fuck niggas like I used to
Shit, I'm back to smokin' like I used to
I can't keep on goin' down like I used to

A lotta changes, I been on some new shit
I've been movin', listen, I ain't gotta prove shit
Been gettin' bread so I can put you on the news clip
But fuck it, I got better shit to do and that's just true shit
Can we fuck and come to an understanding?
Girl I know I fell in love, we never planned it
I think our love is deeper than romantic
Promise I will never let you feel abandoned

Can we fuck and come to an understanding?

Well I woke up this morning with the feeling of rejection
Called your name and you gave me no attention
You didn't care how I feel inside
But like a fool I've been when I swallowed my pride
But you just don't care
You turn away and you act like I'm not there
Into my loneliness I fade away
I only got one thing to say

I love to turn you on
I love to turn you on
I love to turn you on

It's such a mystery the things that you do to me
I don't know whether to laugh or to cry
Sometimes I feel so free
But then when you're with me
The pressure makes me feel like I'm gonna die
You drive me crazy and don't give me time to think
And then you say that you're runnin' away
Till I find out the truth for me and you
I just got one thing to say

I love to turn you on

""Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings.""
""But I'm only going to get this one chance."" (Six minutes— Six minutes—)
""Something's wrong, I can feel it."" (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
""Just a feeling I've got. Like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. 
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; 
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances.""
""You are just what the doc ordered.""

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot

[Verse 1]
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody wants the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got

[Verse 2]
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!""—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard

[Verse 3]
So you'll be Thor, I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?!
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?",Eminem,1994,"[90, 92, 76, 74, 72, 81, 85, 79, 79, 79, 80, 89]",12

I was born three-six-seventy-two, I think it's on a Wednesday
Hail to the moon, just like Kunta Kinte
That means I'm gifted from the get-go, Mom's you never let go
Mad thanks for raising me right, bro
You gave me confidence to stop the nonsense
Didn't live in Bel Air like the Fresh Prince
Times are hard, times are rough
Didn't have Toys 'R' Us toys, but I had enough love
Plus the guidance from above
To go to the park, sweatin', push and shove
Maybe then for a dunk like you told me
Then there were a few times when Dad had to scold me
Prayed for my safety, I know how you was feeling
Didn't want me wheeling and get to drug-dealing
Remember when you asked me this one day
Who I wanna be like, I said Dr. J
Then you said, ""Good, now you gotta go
Take the damn ball and slam it through the hole""
Mom cracked a smile, Daddy gave a frown
I said to myself, ""I can't let them down""
So make way, I'm coming in for a landing
And nothing's gonna' stop me, from being outstanding

[Interlude]
I'm outstanding

[Verse 2]
Now let's skip to the time when I was fifteen
Shaq is in the house, no, Shaq is on the scene
Now my name's in papers, girls caught the vapors
Kids look up to me like a skyscraper
Now, a role model, I mean a role figure
Then I ask myself, can I get any bigger?
My dream is coming true, but coming true slowly
Then I remember what Mom and Dad told me
""Remember this, son, you are the one
Shoot your gift like a gun and never forget where you come from
You're young, gifted, and Black
If they can't say Shaquille O'Neal then make 'em scream, Shaq!'""
Like the fam do, in the stands too
When I freak the funk on a dunk they, ""Ah! Ooh!""
From high school to college, they gave me enough knowledge
Make that gift and now it's time for me to fulfill my dream
To be in the [leaders' game?] like Hakeem
I'll make the backboards shatter
Fans chit-chatter
Even make the other centers get madder
That's me, who can it be?
The master of disaster, seven foot three
Brother, ain't no other in the nation
I'm born from my mother but I'm God's creation
I'm outstanding

[Interlude]
I'm outstanding

[Verse 3]
Cause now I'm outstanding
Wave your hands and pump your fist
When I'm on the court you know it's strictly, ""Swish!""
Cause there's some things that I gotta do:
Tape up the ankle, pump up my Shaq shoe
And now it's time to take care of business
To run up and down the court with Nick and Dennis
Scott, but I won't stop
Gotta keep striving until I reach the top
Gonna take a peek over the mountain
I flow like a fountain
Peace, I gotta go! And I'm out and…
But before I go, wave your hands
Peace to all my family, friends and fam
I'm outstanding

fast. Landing hard on Bagram Air Base.
LUTTRELL (vo)
It’s something most of us have known all of our lives. What we all wanted. It’s in our blood.
A team of medical personal and Navy officers descend on the chopper. An assortment of high-ranking GENERALS and COMMANDING OFFICERS there to meet the chopper. Tight shots. A bloody hand dangles. A tear filled eyeball, sliced feet.
LUTTRELL (CONT’D) (vo)
There’s a storm inside of us. I’ve heard many team guys speak of this. A burning. A river. A drive.
2 INT. OPERATING ROOM 2
Clothes cut. Blood soaked Dog Tags cut. “Luttrell” in UA boxer shorts, IVs and fresh blood bags. Multiple Gunshots. Chunk of an ear missing. Heartbeat monitor. Weak pulse.
LUTTRELL (vo)
An unrelenting desire to push yourself harder and further than anyone could think possible.
Chunks of bullet and shrapnel filling metal bowl. Tears streaming down cheeks, a hand scrawled map on a left thigh, focused eyes of surgeons. Admirals’ pace in the hallway.
LUTTRELL (CONT’D) (vo)
Pushing ourselves into those dark cold corners where the bad things live. Where the bad things fight.
Heart monitor weak. Getting weaker. Compound fracture left shin. Bloody feet rinsed clean. Water flushing out bullet holes. Loose cracked tooth pulled out. Heart monitor getting weaker.
Surgical pack working franticly to save Luttrell. Tight on HEART MONITOR: FLATLINE
LUTTRELL CONT’D
We wanted that fight at the highest
volume. The loud fight. The loudest, coldest, hottest, most unpleasant of the unpleasant fights.
Pushing in on the flatline. Alarm screaming. Tight on Luttrell’s eyes starting to glaze over. Dying.

7 EXT. AFGHAN VILLAGE - DAY 7 INTERCUT AFGHAN VILLAGE. Intro Afghan warlord. AHMAD SHAH.
35 years old. Tall, strong. Fierce. He moves through an Afghan village with a small pack of equally fierce Taliban warriors.
3A.
￼
LOCAL AFGHANS avoid eye contact. This Shah and crew feels like an old school western bad guy moving through a cow town.
NOTHING like the SUICIDE BOMBERS of BAGDAD. These are real warriors. Strong-jawed. Thin but ripped muscles. Worn rich soulful faces, vivid eyes, color reds and blues. Strong boots. Military vests. Good radio equipment. Well-maintained weapons.
Shah’s number two is TARAQ. Late twenties. Shah is vicious, TARAQ, is more vicious. Strong and very, very violent.
A very worthy opponent.
RIGHT now they are clearly pissed. Shah leads the way, walks with purpose.
They are looking for a man. Someone has violated TALIBAN LAW, accused of aiding the Americans.
Shah moves into a house. Women and children terrified. Trembling. Women pleading.
Where is he?
SHAH SHAH Hagha Cherta Dey?
The women scream. As Shah starts throwing teenage boys around the room. Slamming them viciously into walls.
A 25-year-old man Gulab tries to reason with Shah. A YOUNG BOY watches.
GULAB GULAB
Please, we want no trouble. Mehrabani/lutfan, monga hes
mushkil no ghowaro
Taraq throws Gulab down hard. Turns, locks eyes with an older Afghan man(30s). Taraq moves quickly at him, kicking him in the face, his foot down hard on his throat.
SHAH
Have you spoken with the
Americans?
AFGHAN MAN Please! No!
SHAH
Aya taso Americayano sara khaberi keri dey?
AFGHAN MAN
Mehrabani/lutfan! Na!
Gulab watches. Frustrated. Furious.
You lie! Please!
TARAQ
AFGHAN MAN
TARAQ
Ta Dorogh wayee!
AFGHAN MAN
Mehrabani/lutfan!

He’s pressing down hard. Choking the man. The man’s family begs and screams. Shah studies the Afghan deep into his eyes. Decides he’s lying...Shah nods to Taraq.
Taraq yanks the Afghan to his feet. As his children watch Taraq leads the pleading farmer outside. Into the woods.
Taraq and his men throw the Afghan down over a fallen log. Face up.
Two of Taraq’s men hold him by the beard as Taraq stands over him. Razor sharp machete up.
Shah backlit. Ignoring the man’s pleading...as Taraq hacks down with brutal fury.
Tight on Shah, tight on Taraq, blood dripping from his hand. BLACK

MURPHY Is this doable?
LUTTRELL Expensive.
MURPHY How much?
LUTTRELL
Arabic. She’s got good taste.
MURPHY How much?
LUTTRELL
I’ll find out. Expensive.
Murphy is up. Heads out the door. Moves into the hallway. Opens Dietz’s door.

MURPHY (quiet)
Danny. Dietz. Eyes closed.
DIETZ I’m up.
10 INT. GYM - CAMP OUELLETTE 10
Dark, then lights on, revealing a decent cross fit style gym.
Blackboard filled with the current workout leaders. Dietz and Murphy hold most of them.
The two men start to stretch in silence. Luttrell wanders in. A giant bowl of cereal.
LUTTRELL
Since when does she want an Arabic
horse?
MURPHY
Since I got an email this morning.
Probably saw it on Oprah.
LUTTRELL
Oprah rides Arabic horses?
MURPHY
I don’t know what Oprah does.
LUTTRELL She can afford them.
MURPHY
Why? How much do they cost?
LUTTRELL
I don’t know. Oprah money.
Fuck.
MURPHY
LUTTRELL
I thought you guys were doing this
tomorrow.
Murphy and Dietz strap on Body Armor.
7.
LUTTRELL (CONT’D) Maybe I’m starting to become tele
fucking pathic - non-verbal yoda or something. I could swear I just said outloud, that I thought this was happening tomorrow.
Murphy stretching.
MURPHY
I think Red Wings a go. Tonight.
LUTTRELL
Outstanding. SHANE PATTON wanders in.
SHANE PATTON You’re doing it now?
The three men ignore Shane.
SHANE PATTON (CONT’D) (to Luttrell)
They’re going at it now?
LUTTRELL Looks that way.
11 INT. MATT AXELSON’S BUNK - MORNING 11 Axe sleeps. His computer alarm goes off. Incoming voice chat. Slowly Axe reaches down for the computer on his floor.
Axe opens the computer. Signs in.
Incoming from his wife Cindy. “Are you up?”
Axe types.
“Yes my love.”
Cindy.
“What you doing?”
Axe stares at a picture of he and Cindy.
Oh.

“Looking at you.”
CINDY How do I look?
AXE Like Heaven.
12 INT. WEIGHT ROOM - MORNING 12 Dietz and Murphy both warmed up clearly ready for some kind
of competition.
Luttrell sits on a weight bench. Takes off his watch. Dietz and Murphy under pull up bars. HEALY enters.
HEALY

tomorrow...
MURPHY Ready?
Yup.
DIETZ
LUTTRELL Mark. Set. Go.
Luttrell hits the stop watch.
Murphy and Dietz leap to bars, 75 Pull-ups as fast as possible. Brief pauses to recover. 100 push ups. Dietz slightly ahead of Murphy. Sprints out of the gym. Murphy close behind.
The two men charge up and over the gate. Body Armor on.
13 EXT. BAGRAM - MONTAGE - MORNING 13 Murphy and Dietz running hard racing each other on a two mile

“Got to pay the bills.”
Murphy and Dietz sprinting. Dead even. Past Marines. Down a runway full of active aircraft and helicopters.
14 INT. WEIGHT ROOM - DAY 14 Shane benching big. Luttrell munches cereal. Healy doing
pushups.
SHANE PATTON Am I going?
HEALY No idea
LUTTRELL I don’t know.
You know.
SHANE PATTON
LUTTRELL
If I say I don’t know. I don’t
know.
You know.
SHANE PATTON
LUTTRELL
If you go you’ll go. If you don’t
go, trust me you will go. Eventually. Comprende?
SHANE PATTON So, I’m not going?
LUTTRELL I didn’t say that.
SHANE PATTON
You said if you don’t go, you will
eventually go.
LUTTRELL
Yea, that’s not saying your not
going.
SHANE PATTON I’m not going.
Shane back to bench pressing. Luttrell checks his watch, heads out towards the gate.

14A INT / EXT WEIGHT ROOM - DAY 14A
Other SEALs starting to gather. JAMES SUH, DAN HEALY, MIKE MCGREEVY, JAQUES FONTAN, JEFF LUCAS and JEFF TAYLOR
10A.
Dietz and Murphy balls out sprinting. Murphy has him by a few feet coming back to Ouellette iron wall. Murphy throws open the gate, runs inside.
Dietz a second behind. Luttrell looks at his watch.
LUTTRELL Murphy by 1.1.
Exhausted Dietz and Murphy sit in the dirt.
LUTTRELL (CONT’D) Head shave?
DIETZ Fuck.
Axe walks up, shorts and flip flops.
AXE Who won?
LUTTRELL Murphy. Barely.
AXE Head shave?
Dietz looks pained.
MURPHY
Man...I got to think this one out.
If I shave his head, I’m going to have to look at him. Really look at him. Ears, face, funny shaped head...I don’t know. Marcus? What do you think?
LUTTRELL
I don’t know boss...I don’t want to
be looking at him that close either, but he has been running his mouth about beating you...a lot. Head shave is fair.
Axe?
MURPHY
11.
AXE
Hell yea, I say shave him, and he
can’t eat with us, make him eat with E3 Marines until it grows back. Shave the boy.
MURPHY Shane?
SHANE PATTON
Well, I could go both ways on this.
He did lose but, he was close and you’re Mike Murphy and I would have expected a much bigger separation. Plus, we’re at war and there’s the whole Samson thing, so I’m not sure. I’ll plead the fifth on this one.
Murphy looks stares at Shane.
SHANE PATTON (CONT’D) But you’re the boss, boss. So I’m
with you. I’ll shave his head, wax his balls if you give me the order. Sir, I’ll wax my own balls if you take me on Red Wings.
Murphy shakes his head at Patton, looks over to Dietz.
DANNY Come on Mike.
MURPHY
Yea Danny this is probably not
gonna go your way. Shane, get my razor.
SHANE PATTON Getting razor, copy that.
Erik Kristensen, officer in charge, from the deck of the Command Room.
Shane stops. Turns around.
KRISTENSEN Not today.
The SEALs stare up at their boss.
KRISTENSEN (CONT’D) Red Wing’s a go. Today. 1800.
12.
SHANE PATTON Am I going?
KRISTENSEN (ignoring Shane)
PLO in one hour.
Sir?
SHANE PATTON
Kristensen dead eyes Patton. Turns and heads back into TOC. Healy follows
AXE Shane’s going?
MURPHY I don’t think so.
They all walk inside.
SHANE Maybe.
15 INT. RED WINGS PLO (PATROL LEADER’S ORDER) 15
Thirty SEALs plus support packed into the TOC (Tactical Operational Command). Makeshift control center. PowerPoint on flat screen. Operation REDWING is dissected.
MURPHY
Operation Red Wings. The target is
Ahmad Shah and his, we are estimating ten men, “loyal amigos”. Including, this dude,
Slide shifts to a color photo of “Taraq”.
MURPHY (CONT’D) Only have a first name, Taraq.
Seems to do most of the chief shit for Shah.
SEALs study photos.
MURPHY (CONT’D)
We’re going in with a four man team. The recon team is Dietz, Comms. Axe, Nav. Luttrell, Medic.
HEALY
Objective of this mission is to positively identify Ahmad Shah.
Shane’s head in his hands, pissed he is not going...a grainy photo of Ahmad Shah on a large color monitor. PowerPoint.
13.
KRISTENSEN
This is the best picture we have of him. It’s current.
(MORE)
13A.
KRISTENSEN (CONT'D) We know Shah killed fourteen
Marines last Tuesday in Kandahar. We just pulled this video off three different Tali web sights. It will in fact be a glorious day when Ahmad Shah and his good friend Taraq are no longer members of our human community.
Clear video of Shah executing a Taliban woman. Two men hold her down. Shah fires an AK-47. The bullet kicking up dust as it blasts through her skull into the dirt.
The SEALs study this footage. Dead serious.
AXE
Go back...freeze.
Axe studies an image of Shah.
AXE (CONT’D) No earlobes.
MURPHY What’s that?
AXE
The guys got no earlobes.
Silence as the team studies the image.
SHANE
earlobes for anyway?
DIETZ
and balance.
SHANE
DIETZ
I heard earlobes are key for head
balance - equilibrium. Cut a guys ear off, he’s gonna suck on a drunk test, balance beam, tight rope...
LUTTRELL
False. Earlobes have no biological
functions for humans. Fish can use earlobes like a valve to open or close the ear canal.
What are Piercing Balance.
14.
SHANE
Why would a fish want to let water
into his ear canal?
Luttrell shoots him a look - “shut the fuck up”
14A.
Murphy keeps things moving.
MURPHY
Bad guy. Senior Taliban commander
responsible for killing Marines in Eastern Afghanistan and sport killing civilians in the Hindu- Kush. Considered Tier One target rumored to be close to Bin Laden. Axe is going to go over our route in.
AXE
The helo pilots are going to do two
false inserts. Then drop us off at our primary insert, located here. Secondary insert located here. From our primary insert, our bearing will be zero three zero patrolling 1.5 kilometers to our designated lay up point. We will be moving up the backside of this mountain which will offer us good concealment from the target but the terrain is gonna be rocky so watch your footing. I’m estimating it’s gonna take us about two hours to complete.
MURPHY Luttrell - medical
LUTTRELL
First things first, win the fight.
There’s no medicine in a gunfight. It’s self aid, buddy aid, corpsman aide. Two weeks ago, Team 3 was near where you guys will be. Capelli got bit by a rattlesnake. and contrary to popular belief, there is poison oak, so watch the cock and balls cause that will suck. Drink lots of water, wear sunscreen, and Dietz bring your own chapstick.
Dietz stands up, starts talking comms
DIETZ
Crypto will be wide band, segment 2-
4. Murph’s got a SAT phone. Region is very steep so expect typical comms problems. We’ll be on two hour comms windows.
(MORE)
15.
DIETZ (CONT'D)
If we miss two windows I’d say wake somebody up. Other than that, don’t
sweat it.
Murphy picks up a plastic AC-130 and holds it over the map.
MURPHY AC-130 is with us?
15A.
Dietz takes the plane from Murphy. Moves it over the map.
DIETZ
Correct. Just for the infil. All
comms will be relayed through the AC-130, call sign Apollo. Suns up, she’s out. Some of the key pro- words - when we have a successful insert, Budweiser. When we’re halfway through infil, it’ll be Corona. At our observation point, Schlitz Malt Liquor. And if we positively identify Shah: touchdown.
Danny chucks the toy plane.
MURPHY
Reaction Force is the following:
The 47’s will relocate to J-Bad overnight.
Murphy uses toy plastic helicopters to explain the size and location of the QRF.
KRISTENSEN
That’s correct. You’ll have fifteen
team guys, and about a dozen Marines standing by all night. When we hear Schlitz Malt Liquor, we’re heading back to Bagram for phase 2. QRF will stay here - we’re leaving you with 4 team guys, 20 marines, 2 Blackhawks and 2 Apaches. The Apaches stay with the Blackhawks.
The toy Choppers circle on the map giving us a clear understanding of the playing field.
KRISTENSEN (CONT’D) The movement is so we can get the
47’s back here and be ready to bring it for phase two once you get eyes on Shah. Remember - comms will most likely be intermittent and there are reports that non- combatants are being used as recon elements for the enemy.
MURPHY Roger that.
Luttrell spits chew. Danny doodles furious, mashing demons. Axe quietly studies the picture of Ahmad Shah.
16.
JAG GOES OVER RULES OF ENGAGEMENT
AXE Lotta moving parts.
MURPHY
What we do, when we do, what we do.
KRISTENSEN
We go in four hours. I’m pulling up
tomorrow’s new guy presentation to 1800 tonight so that all may revel and partake.
SHANE PATTON Are you serious?
KRISTENSEN
Yes. Glorious evening gentlemen.

Murphy, Luttrell, Axe and Dietz. Eating. Having a fly catch and kill competition.
DIETZ looks stressed.
He’s got a paint tile sample page on the table in front of him. Studying paint samples.
DIETZ
We were gonna wait but she’s all
into it and when she gets her head into something, that’s it. There’s no stopping her.
17.
MURPHY
So just let her do it. It’s good
for her. You got a handy man woman. That’s good.
17A.
MURPHY kills a fly. Places the dead fly by his coffee cup next to three other dead flies.
DIETZ I don’t know.
MURPHY Don’t know what?
DIETZ I don’t know.
What?
MURPHY
AXE
He’s worried that he’s losing
control over his castle.
MURPHY Really.
AXE Ask him.
MURPHY
Are you worried that you’re losing
control over your castle?
DIETZ Shut up Murph.
MURPHY Are you?
LUTTRELL
He’s having control issues cause
he’s the one whose always made the “taste” issues in the family.
DIETZ
She’s got great taste. I trust her.
MURPHY
So what’s the problem?
DIETZ
It’s not a problem. It’s just very
ongoing. Know what I mean?
Luttrell kills a fly. He’s got six dead ones. He and Murphy are competing.
18.
MURPHY
Not really. No. Marcus, you know
what he means? LUTTRELL
Control issues.
MURPHY Is that right?
DIETZ LUTTRELL DIETZ
No.
Yes.
It’s not control issues.
MURPHY What is it?
DIETZ
New grass leads to new bushes by
the window, leads to new windows, leads to new curtains, leads to new sofa, leads to new rug, leads to new floor...
MURPHY Got it.
LUTTRELL
Loss of control. Got to let that
go bro.
DIETZ
It’s like this weird journey that
she’s on. Moving through the house one room to the next.
AXE Where is she now?
DIETZ Kitchen. I think.
Murphy and Luttrell both kill flies at the same time. Marines with Buzz cuts in crisp uniform eating all around the SEALs. Stark contrast.
19.
CUT TO:
18 INT. SEAL TV ROOM 18
Tight on Shane Patton. Doing his best Napoleon Dynamite dance. He is not good. SEALs in lounge chairs. They watch, laugh and taunt. Music loud. Shane powers through. Finishes strong.
Whistles and clapping from the SEALs. AXE stands up. Puts an arm around Patton.
HEALY God was that awful
AXE
Ok, here’s the deal. That sucked,
but I’m voting that we move him forward cause I can’t watch this shit without puking anymore so I say lest be done with it. All in favor?
Luttrell and all SEALs put their hands up, except Murphy.
AXE (CONT’D) Come on Mikey.
MURPHY Can he say it?
Other SEALs agree. Shouting out. Debating whether Shane can “say it”. Making bets.
AXE knows what Murphy is thinking. Pauses. Looks at Shane.
AXE (quiet to Shane)
Can you say it?
SHANE PATTON I think so.
AXE Think so?
SHANE PATTON I can say it.
20.
AXE
Ok. Shut up. Shut the fuck up. He
can say it. Shut up.
The room silences. Patton, nervous, takes a deep breath.
SHANE PATTON (weak, then strong)
I’ve been around the world twice, talked to everyone once. I’ve seen two whales fuck, been to three world fairs, and I even know a man in Thailand with a wooden cock. I’ve pushed more peter, more sweeter, and more completer than any other peter-pusher around.
Tight on the SEALs smiling, some mouthing the words along with Shane.
SHANE PATTON (CONT’D)
I am a hard-bodied, hairy-chested,
rootin, tootin, shootin, parachutin, demolition double cap crimping Frogman.
19 INT. CAMP OUELLETTE SEAL COMPOUND - READY ROOM 19 The entire SEAL TEAM jocks up. Gets ready.

MURPHY watching all of it.
SHANE PATTON (CONT’D) If your feeling froggy than you
better jump because this Frogman has been there, done that and is going back for more.
20 EXT. CHOPPER PAD BAGRAM 20
Sun setting over the Afghan desert. Thirty SEALs laying on the deck on their gear. Chilling out waiting for the 47’s. The guys laying around. Danny studies a piece of paper with color tile samples printed on it.
MURPHY
Seems to me like you’ve got to
straighten this shit out. DANNY
There’s nothing to straighten out.
AXE
If there’s nothing to straighten,
why are you fighting?
DANNY We’re not fighting?
AXE
Well, what is it that you’re doing?
DANNY
We’re more like disagreeing.
22.
AXE Disagreeing or arguing?
DANNY
Probably more like mildly arguing.
Just because you’re Mr. Perfect marriage, don’t be judging us mortal marriages who occasionally have mild disagreements, sometimes even loving arguments.
MURPHY
It’s a fucking stupid loving
argument.
DANNY
It’s not an argument.
LUTTRELL
It is an argument. Sounded like a couple of bighorn rams smashing skulls.
DANNY
What the fuck is everyone listening
to my shit for?
LUTTRELL Bro, you’re loud.
DANNY
You’re louder than I am.
LUTTRELL
Just pick some tile and move the
fuck on.
DANNY
I picked the tile. She doesn’t like
it.
LUTTRELL
What does she fucking like?
DANNY (reading from paper)
“Rose Honey Dew”
LUTTRELL Say what bro?
DANNY
She likes rose honey
dew...something.
23.
LUTTRELL
Are you fucking kidding me?
DANNY That’s what she likes.
LUTTRELL
You gotta control that situation.
AXE
Rose tiles in the kitchen?
DANNY
Can we talk about something else?
AXE
Yea let’s talk about what she’s
gonna tile your bathroom in. DANNY
I don’t wanna talk about that.
MURPHY
(Ron Burgandy impersonation)
Danny? I’m gonna put it out there, if you like it, you can take it, if you don’t, send it right back.
Dietz stares at Murphy.
MURPHY (CONT’D) I wanna be on you.
LUTTRELL I wanna be on you.
MURPHY (pointing at Dietz)
On you.
Dietz smiles. Axe huge smile.
Chopper engines grow louder. 47’s back lit, coming in.

LUTTRELL Next one Shane.
SHANE PATTON Have fun you lucky bastard.
24 EXT. DROP SIGHT 24 As the four SEALs drop fast, land smooth. Luttrell last.
The Chopper pulls up fast and is gone in seconds leaving the four SEALs alone in the dead quiet, pitch black.

He’s back on his feet. Axe pauses. Looks back smiling.
AXE (on radio)

Negative.
I picked it to torture Luttrell.

The team finally makes it to their planned observation spot.
Murphy is the first to have binoculars up and is looking down hill, way down hill at the Afghan village. 2,000 ft., very steep, cliff like. Below them.
DANNY’S POV:
100 stone and wood homes, well-constructed. Looks almost charming. A couple of dozen Afghan villagers in different parts of the village, kids playing, women cooking, two men working on a roof. Looks quite peaceful.
Left: trying to see the rest of the village. Can’t get a good view, a mountain is blocking his view.
Danny has the radio out and is calling in the arrival pro- word.
DANNY (on radio)
Beastmaster, this is Spartan 01, radio check.
28 INT. J-BAD TOC 28

DANNY
Beastmaster, this is Spartan 01. I
pass Schlitz Malt liquor. How copy?
Really weak signal.
HASSLERT
Spartan 01 this is Beastmaster.
Say again your last - you are weak and unreadable.
DANNY
Beastmaster, this is Spartan 01. I
pass Schlitz Malt Liquor, how copy.
HASSLERT
Spartan 01, this is Beastmaster.
Good copy. Hasslert looks to Kristensen.
HASSLERT (CONT’D) Sketchy comms, sir. Spartan 01 has
arrived.
Erik Kristensen sitting. Nods. Gets up. Checks the wall clock: 6:45 AM
Ok.
KRISTENSEN
He stretches, cracks his back, looks to a couple of SEALs manning the TOC.
KRISTENSEN (CONT’D) Later fellas. Night, night.
28A Track out the door with Kristensen, as he, Shane, and Heal2y8A step out of the TOC into the bright Afghan sunshine.
KRISTENSEN (CONT’D) Glorious day.
Kristensen and all but four SEALs head to the waiting 47’s, start boarding.
Kristensen looks to Musslemen, a SEAL who is staying with the QRF.

29 EXT. HINDU KUSH - SCHLITZ MALT LIQUOR WAYPOINT 29
Axelson and Luttrell together, spotting scopes out, they study the village.
LUTTRELL
Can’t see half the village.
MURPHY
Yea.
They study the surrounding area.
MURPHY (CONT’D)
Let’s move down towards that peak,
see if that’s not better.
LUTTRELL Sounds good.
Luttrell looks back at Axe and Dietz. He soft whistles and rolls his index finger, points down towards the peak below them.
Axe and Danny immediately get it. They start moving out.
30 INT. J-BAD TOC 30 PETE MUSSLEMEN, one of the four SEALs left as part of the QRF
in J-Bad, walks into the TOC. Looks to Hasslert.
MUSSLEMEN Are we good?

Murphy, low crawling, gets close to the ledge.
The four SEALs crawling out to the new lookout spot. Murphy’s got his binoculars out.
NEW POV:
A perfect, clear, unobstructed view of the entire Afghan village.
MURPHY We’re good.
Danny, on radio, trying to call in that they’ve relocated. Can’t get through.
DANNY (to Murphy)
No joy.
MURPHY Keep trying.
As the team sets up, Dietz is looking up at the small mountain behind him that seems to be killing his radio.
Series of shots:
Murphy and Luttrell scopes up, start counting Taliban. At forty, Luttrell looks to Murphy.
LUTTRELL That’s more than 10.
Yes.
MURPHY
Murphy is focused on a group of four men off to the side of the village playing a game with stones. Seeing who can throw the farthest.
DOWN IN VILLAGE
30.
Shah and Taraq with three soldiers playing stone throwing game. Laughing. Shah throws his stone. The men argue over who threw further.
HIDE
Murphy locks his sight on Shah. Studying him.
MURPHY (CONT’D)
Marcus.
Murphy hands the scope to Luttrell.
MURPHY (CONT’D)
Four guys on the right. Tall guy.
Red scarf. No earlobes. Luttrell’s scope now trained on Shah.
Luttrell and Murphy both checking wrist bands. Photo of Shah. Clear match.
Bingo.
LUTTRELL
MURPHY Do you have a shot?
LUTTRELL
Jesus Mickey, with this little 556?
I’d need to stalk at least a 1000 yards closer.
MURPHY Gotta call it in.
Murphy turns to Dietz
MURPHY (CONT’D)
Can you make the fucking radio
work?
Dietz tries to call it in - no luck.
Luttrell following Shah’s face with scope. Finger on trigger. VILLAGE
Shah arguing with his soldiers over who threw further. Proclaims himself winner. Moves out of village into woods.
HIDE Luttrell’s POV:
30A.
Shah disappears from sight. Murphy gets Axe’s attention.
MURPHY (CONT’D)
Axe, stay put. Keep eyes on, we’re
gonna move back.
Murphy, Luttrell and Dietz get up; moves away from the ridge line, start building their hides.
31A ABOVE THE RIDGELINE -- 31A Marcus and Murphy talk as they work.
30B.
LUTTRELL
If we’re home by the 15th, me and
Morgan are gonna cut down all the trees behind the stable.
MURPHY
How does that help me?
LUTTRELL
Brahms horse auction is, I think
the 27th.
MURPHY
Is he selling Arabic horses?
Kristensen says I should get her whatever Silver was.
Silver?
LUTTRELL
MURPHY
Hi-Ho Silver. Lone Ranger’s horse.
LUTTRELL
Yea that’s a badass horse.
MURPHY
She doesn’t want a badass horse.
She wants an Arabic horse.
LUTTRELL
Dude, how’s she going to know the
difference. Get her a Quarter Horse, tell her it’s an Arabic. If she busts you, tell her if it’s good enough for the Lone Ranger...
MURPHY
How much for an Arabic?
LUTTRELL Probably around 15 grand.
MURPHY
Fuck.
Hell of a wedding present.
LUTTRELL MURPHY LUTTRELL
Yea.
Is the redhead a bridesmaid?
31.
MURPHY Melissa?
LUTTRELL The redhead?
MURPHY Melissa?
LUTTRELL
The redhead from the Coldplay
concert?
MURPHY That’s Melissa.
LUTTRELL Is she coming?
31A.
MURPHY
She’s a fucking bridesmaid.
LUTTRELL I love her.
MURPHY
Get me a deal on the horse. I’ll
get that done.
LUTTRELL That works.
- Powerful scopes and cameras.
- Luttrell and Axe draw detailed maps, diagrams, blueprints of every structure in the village.
Luttrell photos Arab men with weapons moving through the town. CLEARLY A TALIBAN PRESENCE.
- Dietz photographs windows, doors, detailed notes on hinges, wall thickness, structure, etc..
- Murphy taking the drawings, photoshopping them on a Toughbook computer.
Dietz eats a PowerBar. Axe watches him.
AXE
Shouldn’t eat that shit.
Why?
DIETZ
AXE Toxic.
DIETZ You eat em...
AXE Never.
DIETZ
I’ve seen you eat PowerBars.
AXE
Never. I don’t eat shit bars.
DIETZ Shit bars?
32.
AXE
Why you eating a shit bar?
Dietz pauses. Pulls his eyes off his scope.
DIETZ
I’m eating it because I’m hungry.
AXE Eat an apple.
DIETZ
I know what I’m eating.
AXE Negative.
Axe reading the list of ingredients commenting on each one.
DIETZ
I know exactly what I’m eating.
33.
31B LATER. 31B - Dietz sleeps.
- Murphy eats an apple.
- Axe up top on security.
- Luttrell throws berries at a sleeping Dietz. - Axe studies the village.
34.
POV AXE:
Ahmad Shah moving through village. Taraq and two men with him, all armed.
MURPHY
Danny your on, everybody else shut
her down.
- Luttrell, Axe, and Murphy settle in to sleep.
34A.
- Dietz, glasses up, studies the village.
32 EXT. HINDU KUSH - MORNING 32 Sun getting higher. Low fog. Murphy, Axe, Luttrell sleep.
Danny on watch. Wedged into a tree stump.
ON DANNY.
Tired but awake. Alert. Quietly singing to himself.
TIGHT ON DANNY. His eyes a micro shift of focus. He stills himself ever so slightly.
DANNY’s POV
He’s looking down hill. Wide gentle slope of the mountain leading to a sharper drop. The fire lights up the village far below.
Nothing moves.
BACK to Danny. Eyes more focused. He slowly reaches down and kills the iPod.
Silence. Danny studies the hill with increasing focus. POV.
Nothing moves.
The three SEALs sleep.
Tight on Luttrell. Sleeping.
THEN a very faint sound from down hill. Silence. Then another.
Luttrell slowly opens his eyes. Listening. Another sound, a soft bell.
Marcus shifts, looks down hill.
Marcus’s POV
Looking down hill. Nothing moving. The sounds becoming more present. Bells.
Tight on Luttrell. Looking.
FADE OUT:
35.
BACK TO HIS POV
The empty hill. More Bells. Then cresting the hill. First just the tips of the ears. Then the forehead, nose, face....
A large male goat.
Bell ringing gently from his neck.
TIGHT ON MARCUS
Studying the goat.
As another goat appears. Then another...then another...then twenty...
A herd of goats moving up the hill right at them.
Marcus is wide awake, eyes scanning the hill scanning the goats when...
A human head crests the hill. A young Afghan BOY, ten years old.
Luttrell reaches for his Mark 12, looks over to Axe still sleeping. Then to Murph still sleeping. Then back to Danny.
Danny’s already on scope. Gun aimed at the approaching kid when...
Two more Afghan MEN crest the hill - an old man and a teenager.
The hill is full of goats. More than a hundred with the three Afghans moving straight at the SEALs.
The goat bells and baying of the animals creating serious noise. Murph and Axe both waking up.
Weapons coming up as they silently take in this bizarre situation.
Back to Marcus as the first goat passes by. Then another. Tight on lead Afghan boy...THE GOAT BOY.
He’s heading dangerously close to Luttrell’s hide singing quietly to himself.
Tight on Luttrell. Gun up and trained on the goat boy as he gets closer...closer...and then in a one in a million...this fucking goat boy takes one more step and comes down square on Luttrell’s head.
36.
Luttrell moves, the kid screams, Luttrell’s up, gun up...screaming.
LUTTRELL Get the fuck down.
Axe, Danny, and Murphy. Guns up moving in fast on the terrified goat men...
DANNY Down Down Down.
The kid screams and starts running downhill towards the village. AXE sprints on him fast, takes the kid down, hand over mouth.
Kid bites and struggles wild.
Goats running in fear as the three Afghans are roughly thrown down. Searched, a military style Motorola walkie talkie taken from the old man, flex-cuffed and gagged...
When it’s done the four SEALs stand over them. Murphy looking at Luttrell.
Fuck.
MURPHY
Murphy looks to Dietz.
MURPHY (CONT’D) (re: radio)
Can you get a call out or what? Dietz reaches for his radio.
33 INT. J-BAD TOC 33
In the radio room. Musselman and Comms guys by their radios. SILENT. Clearly Spartan 01 is not getting through.
34 BACK ON THE MOUNTAIN 34 The goats spread out, grazing, bells ringing loud. a large
dog, mouth foaming, growls and bark at the team.
Luttrell raises his Mark 12 at the dog when it gets too close.
Murphy is trying to interrogate the older man with a translation box. He speaks into it and it’s supposed to translate into Pashto.
37.
They have separated the older man from the boys. Murphy and Luttrell have them off to the side.. Axe stands watch over the boy.
MURPHY
(speaking into the Phrase-
O-Later)
Are you looking for Americans?
A robotic-like voice used for making out the question in Arabic.
The old man stares at Murphy with a combination of hatred and confusion.
MURPHY (CONT’D)
Do the Taliban know we are up here?
Death stare from the old man. Murphy getting frustrated. Louder.
MURPHY (CONT’D) Do they know?
The old man stares, finally says something quiet. Too quiet for the translating machine. Murphy puts the mic closer.
MURPHY (CONT’D) Say again. Are you Taliban?
The old man rants on as the machine struggles to translate his slang Pashtun.
TRANSLATION MACHINE
Do not drink with many blood rooms
fire and knives...
MURPHY
This fuckin thing’s not working...
The machine starts translating what Murphy is saying.
MURPHY (CONT’D) Shut the fuck up !
Murphy throws the machine on the ground.
The dog makes another move at Luttrell. Fangs mashing. Luttrell raises his gun. The dog backs down.
35 OMIT 35
38.
36 EXT. BACK ON THE MOUNTAIN 36 Danny continues to try his radio.
DANNY
Spartan 01, Spartan base...Spartan
01, Spartan base...
Murphy standing just off the group calls Luttrell over.
MURPHY Marcus.
Leaving Axe on security. Luttrell moves up the hill fifty feet with Murphy.
MURPHY (CONT’D) What do you think?
LUTTRELL
Murphy’s God Awful law. Not you
Mikey. The other prick. The God of screw-ups.
Nothing.
Yea.
MURPHY
LUTTRELL Soft Compromise bro.
MURPHY
Yea. I’m aware of that.
Murphy digs into his pack, pulls out his SATELLITE PHONE. Checks numbers on his wrist pad. Dials up J-Bad TOC (Command Center).
MURPHY (CONT’D) (a touch frustrated: to
Dietz)
I’m now going to be that guy calling on a fucking unsecure Sat line because your radio is not functioning.
DIETZ
Move that mountain, we’re good.
Talk to the mountain, sir.
39.
Loses the signal twice. Third try he gets through. Horrible connection.
37 INT. J-BAD TOC 37 A phone rings, answered by a young Marine, SGT. HASSLERT.
HASSLERT
J-Bad TOC, SERGEANT HASSLERT.
MURPHY
Sergeant can you hear me, this is
Spartan 01, can you here me? Horrible delays, echoes and static.
Hello?
HASSLERT
MURPHY
This is Spartan 01, do you hear me?
HASSLERT I hear you.
MURPHY
This is not a secure line and I
need to speak to the CO immediately.
The CO?
HASSLERT
MURPHY That’s correct.
HASSLERT Which CO sir?
MURPHY Commander Kristensen.
HASSLERT
Commander Kristensen is not here
sir.
MURPHY
What do you mean he’s not there?
HASSLERT
Commander Kristensen left this
morning.
40.
Murphy realizing Right. That’s
STATIC BAD Hello?
Hello?
he’s made a mistake.
MURPHY
Fuck. He’s back at BAGRAM.
HASSLERT correct sir.
MURPHY HASSLERT MURPHY
I‘m here, I need to speak right now with the commander.
HASSLERT Commander is in BAGRAM.
MURPHY
I know that can you please transfer
this call to BAGRAM OUELLETTE TOC.
HASSLERT Roger that. Stand by.
MURPHY Standing by.
Silence Murphy looks down at the goat herders. Moves over to Danny with the radio. Holding up his SAT phone.
MURPHY (CONT’D)
(re: SAT phone)
Handing them our goddamned position.
Tight on Murphy, the realization of how fucked they are is starting to settle in.
MURPHY (CONT’D) What’s the fucking problem?
DANNY Don’t know.
MURPHY
Does it need new fucking batteries?
41.
DANNY
No, it’s fine but they won’t
fucking answer me.
38 INT. OUELLETTE TOC 38
It’s quiet. Among the SEALs present: Patton, James Suh, Dan Healy. A phone in the SEAL TOC rings answered by PATTON
SHANE PATTON Ouellette TOC Petty Officer
Patton..
MURPHY Patton, this is Murphy.
Really Bad connection.
SHANE PATTON
You’re looking for Mike Murphy?
MURPHY This is Mike Murphy.
SHANE PATTON Mike Murphy?
MURPHY
Yes correct, this is Mike Murphy. A horrible connection.
Patton is confused. He knows that Murphy and his team are way deep on their opp.
Mike?
SHANE PATTON
MURPHY Is this Shane?
SHANE PATTON
It’s Shane. What’s up Mike? This
connection sucks.
MURPHY
Are you not receiving our transmissions?
SHANE PATTON Radio calls? Not in a while.
Patton yells over to the Comms guys.
42.
SHANE PATTON (CONT’D) Are you all hearing anything from
SPARTAN 1.
COMMS GUY
When? We’ve been communicating.
SHANE PATTON (back on the phone)
They say they are communicating with you.
MURPHY Say again.
SHANE PATTON
Comms says that you are good. Copy?
MURPHY
In the last twenty minutes?
SHANE PATTON (back to comms guy)
You talked in the last twenty minutes?
COMMS GUY Negative.
SHANE PATTON (into phone)
Negative Murph.
MURPHY
I need the skipper now.
SHANE PATTON He’s sleeping sir.
MURPHY Wake him up now.
Murphy’s voice is electronically garbled.
SHANE PATTON
Did you say wake him up sir?
MURPHY Right the fuck now!
SHANE PATTON Roger that.
43.
39 EXT. BAGRAM TOC. 39
SHANE PATTON barefooted jogs out of the TOC moves through a series of plywood barracks. Knocks on a door.
SHANE PATTON Skipper. Skipper.
He knocks harder.
SKIPPER! From inside.
SHANE PATTON (CONT’D)
KRISTENSEN (oc)
What?
SHANE PATTON
Sir sorry sir. I’ve got Lieutenant
Murphy on the phone in the TOC. Says he needs to talk to you. Now.
A moment, then Kristensen’s door flies open. Kristensen in his underwear, flip flops, moving out, clearly just waking up.
39A Track with them as Kristensen moves back into the TOC. 39A Reaches for the phone.
KRISTENSEN (into phone)
Mike? Silence Static.
KRISTENSEN (CONT'D) Mike...? Mike...? Try him back.
PATTON reads Murphy’s SAT phone number off the board. Dials. Waits. Nothing. Tries again nothing.
KRISTENSEN (CONT'D) Is it dead?
SHANE PATTON
Yes sir. What’d he want?
KRISTENSEN
44.
SHANE PATTON No idea sir.
KRISTENSEN Did he say anything?
SHANE PATTON
Just that he needed to speak to
you.
KRISTENSEN Anything wrong?
SHANE PATTON Didn’t say sir.
Stay with Kristensen a bit concerned. Looking at the map of the Valley.
TIGHT ON KRISTENSEN
Thinking.....
40 EXT. HINDU KUSH MOUNTAIN 40 Murphy trying his IRIDIUM SAT phone one more time.
MURPHY
Can someone explain to me why they
both crash at the same time?
LUTTRELL AXE
Murphy’s law. Murphy’s law
Now a last resort. Murphy keys his personal radio. An MBITR
walkie talkie mounted on the side of his chest.
MURPHY (CONT’D)
Spartan 01 to anyone. Spartan 01 to
anyone listening. Over.
LUTTRELL
We could light these goats on fire
and smoke signal our way out of here.
DANNY
I could go down to the village and
ask to borrow a phone.
Murphy just stares at the goat herders.
45.
MURPHY
(quietly to himself)
Fuck.
LUTTRELL
You’d get some interesting tile
ideas down there bro. Afghan Dirt Brown. Goat skin blond, she’ll dig that a hell of a lot more than what is it Honey creme...?
The goat noise is now really loud. Dogs barking and Axe is getting focused. Doing the math.
The kid bolts. Hands cuffed behind his back, he’s still fast as shit.
AXE Fuck me.
He charges again after the kid. Tackles him. Drags him back. AXE breathing hard. Looking at Murphy.
MURPHY
I’m thinking three ways this plays
out.
All eyes on Murphy. His brain churning.
MURPHY (CONT’D)
We let em go, we’re gonna fight. So
we can 1) Tie em up. Move out. Probably take them 15 minutes to get out. 2) Let em go. We hike out. Roll dice.
DIETZ Three?
AXE
Three, soft Compromise. Terminate
the compromise.
Axe stares at Murphy. Third choice is obvious.
Murphy looks up to the mountain top a mile behind them.
MURPHY
Can we get a signal from that
mountain?
46.
DANNY
I thought about that. Probably. I
don’t fucking know.
More dog barking, goat baying, bells ringing. The kids are staring rage into the eyes of the Americans.
DANNY (CONT’D) We gotta do something boss.
MURPHY
Yea.
Murphy walks back down to Luttrell and Axe.
MURPHY (CONT’D) What do you think?
LUTTRELL
They don’t seem to like us very
much.
MURPHY A pause. Reality setting in.
AXE
Shah’s down there. We let them go,
Shaw disappears. Mission fails.
MURPHY What? Kill them.
Axe stares at Murphy.
Murphy staring at Axe. Realizing how serious he is.
AXE
We are compromised Mike.
Marcus spits out some chew. Looking down, he shakes his head. A pained grin plasters his face.
Yea.
Shit.
LUTTRELL
47.
MURPHY Danny?
Danny takes a long look at the goat herders. Finally...
DANNY
I don’t give a shit what you
decide. I’m not a lawyer. Just tell me what to do Murph. You’re the big bucks, earn em’.
Murphy turns to Marcus.
MURPHY Marcus?
LUTTRELL I don’t know Mikey.
Luttrell takes his time. The goats sound like they are howling. The vibe on the mountain is becoming deathly serious.
LUTTRELL (CONT'D)
I don’t know. I don’t like it. We
kill them. Yea ok. We kill them. Bury them. They get found. Then what...
AXE Then what?
LUTTRELL
I’m just saying. It ain’t gonna be
private. Gonna be out there for the whole fucking world. CNN -- SEALs kill goat farmers. I don’t want that legacy, bro. I’m not killing goat farmers. Not feeling that.
48.
AXE
I’m not either, but the
Old man’s Tali and these kids can shoot better than you can.
LUTTRELL
Let’s just tie ‘em up and get the
fuck out of here.
AXE
We tie them up, we have no control over when they get found; get free. I will die before I let them dictate when we die. I will not end up showing your body -- your head -- on television. On the Computer. No way, they do not get that vote.
LUTTRELL
Then let’s just get the fuck out of
here.
I will do this, I will kill them right now. They will not harm you or me or my wife or your wife or any of our unborn children. No. These people are death and I will not fucking bow to this.
MURPHY
You want to kill, Axe? Really?
That’s your position?
AXE
I want to be playing golf with
Freddie Couples on Pebble Beach, but I’m having a little trouble getting a tee time.
LUTTRELL
If we kill these kids, it’s International news. CNN doesn’t care about Rules of Engagement. SEALs kill kids. That’s the story. Forever.
Tight on the guys taking this in. Murphy paces, staring intensely at one of the goat kids.
MURPHY
Axe what’s your call?
AXE
49.
Axe stares at Murphy.
AXE (sad grin)
My final answer?
49A.
MURPHY Your final answer.
AXE Kill them.
This hits hard.
MURPHY Danny?
Dietz stares at the tied up kids.
DANNY It’s your call bro.
MURPHY
You don’t have an opinion?
DANNY
Yea I have an opinion. Two
opinions. One is that for the record I don’t give a fuck what anyone thinks about what the fuck we do up here. We do what we do. What we have to do. That’s it. That’s our business.
MURPHY What’s two?
DANNY
Two is, this is the Navy and you’re
the boss and your job is to be the boss and my job is to do what I’m fucking told.
Ok.
MURPHY
DANNY
So you tell me what to do and it
will be done. Murphy looks to Marcus.
MURPHY
Marcus what’s your call?
Luttrell seems to get that with Danny out, Murphy’s for letting them go, Axe wants them dead - he’s the tie-breaker.
50.
ON MURPHY.
LUTTRELL
(slowly shaking his head)
No. I’d rather fight them straight up. I don’t want to kill these kids.
Thinking. He looks around the area. Looking for a burial spot. Stabbing at the stone earth with his M4. Clearly no soft earth anywhere close.
MURPHY (quiet)
Fuck me.
Murphy stares down at the Afghan village. Then long and hard at the three Afghans. Finally turns back to goat herders.
DANNY
Look at them. They fucking hate us.
We don’t know how many Hajji’s they have down there. We can’t let them go.
LUTTRELL
So now you have an opinion? I
thought you were standing by waiting for your orders?
AXE
This opp is a soup sandwich. Been so from the beginning. The pitch. The rope. Worst comms that I’ve ever seen. Soft intel, we are not wearing vests, have no heavy weapons, are weak in numbers.... It’s a cursed opp.
MURPHY
Starting to feel like a cursed opp.
LUTTRELL
It’s not a cursed opp. There are no fucking curses. Just Afghanistan. That’s all. Everyday man. Devil’s asshole.
AXE
Shah just killed twenty marines
last week and we’re on him. We’ve come this far and these people here are him. They are a part of him. We let them go.
(MORE)
51.
AXE (CONT'D)
We’re letting him go and why in the
fucking world does he have the right to do that to us?
Axe is starring at LUTTRELL.
51A.
Silence.
AXE.
Seriously Marcus. Why does he have
the right to do that to us?
LUTTRELL
I don’t see it that way.
MURPHY
So what is your fucking call bro?
LUTTRELL
Let them go. Shut it down.
So if Murphy was taking a vote it seems like it’s one vote for killing them, one vote for letting them go, Danny is neutral.
This is all on MURPHY.
Murphy turns away from them, looking down the steep pitched mountain. The village far below.
Murphy thinks. Looks at the young kids. The old man.
MURPHY
Here’s what we’re gonna do. Pack
up. Everything. We’re gonna let ‘em go and we’re gonna make the peak. When we make the peak were gonna make Comms. We’re calling QRF and we’re getting out.
Silence as the guys take in the plan. Luttrell lets out a huge breath.
MURPHY (CONT’D) That’s what we’re going to do.
DANNY Roger that.
LUTTRELL Yes sir.
MURPHY Let’s move it.
Quick Shots.
The guys quickly breaking down their gear. The goat boy watching confused.
52.
The older Goat herders. Defiant. Steel-eyed.
52A.
41 INT. SEAL TOC. BAGRAM. 41
Kristensen, Patton with Petty Officer Dan Healy, James Suh and some COMMS guys.
The Comms guys trying to get Spartan 01 back on line.
COMMS GUY
Spartan 01, Spartan 01, over.
Kristensen is on the phone, communicating with J-Bad TOC
KRISTENSEN
When was your last contact with
Spartan 01?
42 EXT. J-BAD TOC. 42 The two Blackhawks standing by with the two Apaches.
The Apache pilots are firing up their engines.
Musslemen comes out of a pilot station.
MUSSLEMEN
Where are you guys going?
APACHE PILOT
We just got called North. By an
Army 372, evidently they took some small fire.
MUSSLEMEN
We’re QRF, bro.
APACHE PILOT
That’s what we thought. BAGRAM is
now QRF.
The 47s?
Correct.
Are we not the QRF now?
APACHE PILOT That’s my understanding.
Mussleman is a bit confused...
MUSSLEMEN
APACHE PILOT
MUSSLEMEN
53.
Apache pilots climb into their two birds. Take off.
43 EXT. MOUNTAIN 43
10 MINUTES LATER:
Gear packed the four SEALs stand over the Afghans.
MURPHY CONT’D Everybody good?
Quick nods from the team as Murphy’s flip knife comes out. He quickly cuts through the flex cuffs. Freeing the Afghans.
MURPHY
You three just won the lottery.
Speak well of us.
An odd moment as the Afghans stare at the SEALs. Not fully understanding that they are free to leave.
Go!
MURPHY (CONT’D)
The little goat boy stares at Murphy. A beat then gets it. Turning fast he takes off sprinting down the hill.
The old man holds a beat. Says something quietly to the team. Sounds fairly ominous.
Then he too turns and slowly, deliberately starts making his way down the long steep mountain.
Murphy looks at the team.
MURPHY (CONT’D) Let’s move it.
The four SEALs, full gear, start moving up the mountain.
There is no trail. Just steep rocks, fallen trees, and a brutal pitch.
43A THE YOUNG GOAT BOY. 43A RUNNING DOWN THE HILL.
54.
Leaping over rocks. Fallen trees. The kid’s movements are beautiful. Mountain agility in his DNA. Virtually FLYING down the mountain.
43B UP TOP. 43B
Slow going for the SEALs. Murphy leading. Danny, loaded up with COMMS, second. Luttrell breathing hard. Axe bringing up the rear.
On AXE
Constantly checking behind him.
His left foot catches on some loose granite. Gives out.
Axe rolls his ankle hard. Slips, falls hard sliding fast tumbling and smashing hard into a fallen tree stump.
Sprained right ankle and bruised left ribs.
Murphy stops, looking back as Luttrell moves down to Axe. Axe struggling back on his feet.
You ok?
LUTTRELL.
AXE Fucking Afghanistan.
LUTTRELL.
Yea. I’m the one who’s supposed to
be falling.
AXE I’m fine.
He takes a step. White flash of burst pain tears through him. He buckles. Clearly not alright.
43C THE GOAT KID 43C Running hard approaching the village.
43D UP TOP. 43D Luttrell reaches for him. Axe pulls away.
AXE (CONT'D) I’m good. Let’s go.
Axe digs his foot in. Grinds through the pain and starts back up the hill.
55.
AXE (CONT'D)
Maybe we should just hike down to
the village, ask to borrow a phone.
Tight on Murphy’s small smile as he digs it up the hill. The group now moving even slower cause of Axe’s ankle.
44 EXT. THE VILLAGE. 44
Quiet. A couple of small fires. Some cooking. A group of young boys playing with sticks. Women cooking as - The young GOAT BOY comes tearing, full sprint into the village.
TIGHT ON THE GOAT BOY. Eyes wide. Screaming for Shah.
Villagers start to gather. Shah approaches the boys. Breathing hard, they point up the mountain.
A couple of Taliban hear this. Take off into the woods.
TRACKING with the two Taliban.
As they sprint deeper into the woods. Into the Taliban camp.
Taliban soldiers sleeping. The two find Shah and Taraq. Tell them about the Americans.
Shah quickly on his walkie talkie, old school but deathly effective. Rounding up his fighters.
Quick shots of the Taliban army. Feels like 150 men. Arming themselves. AK’s, RPG’s, grenades, a lot of ammo. Radio gear.
Quiet, cool, professional. These Afghan soldiers are loading up big time...
45 EXT. UP MOUNTAIN. 45 The SEALs cresting the hill.
Fuck.
MURPHY
He’s looking up at a larger hill in front of them. They have just ascended a false summit. Still blocked in by another very steep mountain.
Danny?
MURPHY (CONT'D)
56.
Dietz is already into the radio, as Luttrell and Axe spread out, digging in, guns pointed down hill.
Nothing.
DANNY (on radio)
Anvil 1 this is Spartan 01, over.
MURPHY Great.
Comms still clearly dead. Murphy weighing his options. They are high above the village. Murphy pulls out binoculars. Scanning the village and mountain.
All three SEALs on glass. SCANNING. SEALS POV
Nothing moving. From their vantage the town seems quiet. Business as usual.
They cannot see the Taliban off in the woods. They are OBLIVIOUS to the magnitude of the threat.
CUT TO:
46 TWENTY MINUTES LATER. 46
Danny still working the radio. Axe has tightened his boot. Murphy and Luttrell have spread out on the hill. Staring down at the village.
Murphy’s got his SAT phone out. Trying to get a signal. Can’t.
He’s looking with disgust at the mountain behind him, knowing that it’s blocking his signal.
MURPHY (to mountain)
Move Bitch.
Luttrell’s fifteen feet to his left.
LUTTRELL What do you want to do?
MURPHY
Go home, get in bed, and watch
Anchorman.
57.
Check.
LUTTRELL
MURPHY I wanna be on you.
LUTTRELL
Roger that. Should I spread the
word?
MURPHY
Not just yet. Let’s hold up for an
hour and see just how big of a can of hell we’ve opened.
LUTTRELL What do you think?
MURPHY
We did the right thing. We let our
love light shine. God ought to be smiling down on us. Isn’t that how it works? Good things happen to good people?
LUTTRELL
You think they’re coming after us?
MURPHY
Like a pack of wild dogs.
MURPHY keys his radio.
MURPHY (CONT’D) What say you Axe?
AXE (on radio)
I’m fine.
Murphy looks up behind him to the large cliff.
MURPHY (to Axe)
You good to go?
AXE
No problems boss.
MURPHY
Here’s the deal. Lay low here.
Soon as the sun sets we move.
(MORE)
58.
MURPHY (CONT'D)
If we can’t get comms from that top we’re probably gonna have to walk home anyway, so get some rest. Axe you’re first security. We move in about sixty minutes.
46A THIRTY MINUTES LATER. 46A Murphy, Danny, and Marcus. Hats low. Eyes closed. Danny on
the glass.
It’s quiet. Sun getting low. Probably two hours of sunlight left.
ON AXE.
Calmly checking down hill, whistling very quietly to himself.
Tight on Luttrell resting.
Danny. Eyes closed. One arm around his radio.
Murphy. Eyes open. Staring up at the sky.
Back to Axe. Focused down range.
Down the mountain. Something appears to move. Axe misses it. Hold a beat. More movement.
Just catches Axe’s peripheral... Axe shifts his gaze. Focusing.
THEN
More movement. Axe sees it, raises his gun eye to the scope. Gently scanning the area of movement.
Stops whistling.
AXE’S POV:
No movement.
Axe slowly pans his M-4 across the hill. Suddenly A FLASH OF SOMETHING HUMAN.
A HUMAN. He pans a bit more to the right. Then two more.
AXE pans way to the right. Almost as high as the SEALs are and he see’s more movement.
They are almost surrounded.
TIGHT ON LUTTRELL eyes still closed.
59.
MURPHY (CONT'D) (oc)
Sssst! Sssst!
Luttrell lifts up his hat and looks left.
Sees Axe, rigid, in firing position, his rifle aimed straight up the mountain.
MURPHY (CONT'D) (to Danny)
Try and call it in.
Danny desperate to get the radio to work.
Luttrell fixes his Mark 12 into firing position looks through scope down hill.
LUTTRELL’S POV.
Lined along the top are at least a dozen heavily armed Taliban warriors, each one of them with an AK pointing downward. Some carrying rocket propelled grenades.
LUTTRELL looks left.
More Taliban coming down hill to flank them. Luttrell looks right.
More Taliban.
The SEALs are FUCKED.
MURPHY (CONT'D)
How the fuck fast are these little
bastards? All four SEALs guns up.
Marcus in the middle, Axe and Danny up to his left. Murphy twenty feet off to his right. Marcus slowly belly crawls towards Murphy.
MURPHY (CONT'D) What are you thinking?
LUTTRELL
I’m thinking that we’re about
fixing to get into a pretty good gunfight.
Yea.
MURPHY
60.
LUTTRELL
Looks like I voted wrong.
MURPHY
Negative. We’ve been given the
opportunity to reach out and make some hell fucking strong contact with our friends from the other side. Job well done.
LUTTRELL Hoo-yah to that sir.
ON DANNY AND AXE
Looking up the hill which is now swarming with Taliban. Dozens of soldiers flowing down hill flanking them.
DANNY Do they see us?
AXE Dunno.
BACK TO MARCUS.
His back pressed up against a tree, inventorying his ammo. Grenades. Knife.
Danny, Axe, Murphy all doing the same. Readying for war.
Axe and Danny sneak quick looks at the pictures of their wives taped inside their helmets.
The trap tightening around all of them. All four focused up hill.
A TREE TWENTY FEET IN FRONT OF MARCUS.
A flash of a turban. Glint of an AK Barrel pointed in his general direction.
Luttrell tightens the grip of his rifle slowly starts pointing it in the direction of the man behind the tree.
Luttrell eyes on glass, still as marble. Aimed at the tree.
Marcus looks over his shoulder at Murphy whose gun is also trained on the tree.
Marcus eyes back on the scope. SCOPE POV:
61.
A fierce-eyed Taliban warrior peering straight into the scope. Black eyes and thick black beard. The barrel of his AK pointed dead on Luttrell.
Hold.
THEN.
Luttrell fires once. Blowing the man’s head off.
An odd brief moment of silence as the head shot Afghan stumbles, still standing, still clutching his AK-47. He takes three more steps towards Luttrell.
Stops.
Luttrell shoots again removes what’s left of the fighter’s head.
The Afghan starts to fall and as he hits the ground, all HELL BREAKS LOOSE.
From above and half way down both flanks the Taliban open fire.
Screaming at each other, communicating through violent, loud bursts of Pashto, the Taliban moving fast down the hill. Agile and fearless, not weighted down with US-style gear, they are able to leap boulders, fallen trees.
Taraq in the middle of the pack on the top of the SEALs. UP TOP - Shah calmly giving orders into his radio comms.
ON MURPHY.
Taliban moving down the hill on both sides. Shooting as they move.
A solid line of at least fifty Taliban in firing positions on top of the hill above them.
The SEALs are close to being surrounded.
MURPHY checks his rear.
MURPHY POV
A cliff. More of a series of cliffs. Multiple death falls. First one is at least 300 feet.
Murphy calls it.
Push right flank.
MURPHY
62.
Axe the farthest right starts shooting and moving right INTO the wall of the Taliban flanking his right.
Luttrell follows staying low, shooting, Danny firing with one arm. Desperate to get the radio up.
DANNY
Spartan 01 reporting major enemy
contact. We need help. Spartan 01 reporting major enemy contact. Request immediate QRF! Spartan 01 requesting immediate QRF.
Murphy’s doing the same with his SAT phone. He’s moving right trying to dial up the TOC. Not getting through.
Danny’s left two fingers HIT. Dangling bloody and mangled.
He tries to put them back into his hand. Jams his ring finger back into its socket. His pinkie is beyond repair.
DANNY (CONT’D)
Marcus!
Luttrell turns, Danny holds up his fucked up hand.
LUTTRELL Wrap it up bro.
DANNY Roger that.
Taliban gunfire is picking up. Axe the deepest right kills two Taliban. Two more immediately fill their positions.
MURPHY
Danny did you get the call through?
DANNY
I made the call. Don’t know if it
went through. You?
MURPHY
I couldn’t get a line.
DANNY Fuck.
Marcus is pushing right behind Axe trying to break the right Taliban flank.
Charging the Ambush.
63.
MURPHY
Keep pushing right. Kill ‘em all.
The four SEALs fighting well as a team. Crawling, shooting and covering as they start making progress killing their way into the right side of the Taliban ambush.
The Taliban close enough to see clearly.
Axe shot through the left shoulder. Ignoring it he keeps firing. His long scope making him very accurate. As he shoots deep into the left flank.
TALIBAN POV:
From behind at least 12 Tabliban fighters pushing deeper into the right side.
Two more Taliban hit. The remaining start taking solid covering positions, firing down at the four SEALs.
Axe being the closest takes the majority of the firepower.
Decent cover from a granite boulder which is getting hacked to pieces by the incoming AK fire.
Razor sharp stone shrapnel chunks slicing into Axe’s face and neck. Blood runs down his face drips off his chin.
Luttrell getting equally shot up. Returning fire. His cover rock getting shot up bad. Chunks of granite tearing into his face and neck.
FURTHER to the left, Danny and Murphy shooting, trying to get closer to Luttrell and Axe.
Danny takes another round, blowing clear through his right thigh shattering his right femur. Blood, muscle chunks and bone tear through his pants.
DANNY Goddammitt.
Pissed he keeps moving. Firing. Ignoring his two gunshots. Hand and Leg.
Danny moves up with Murphy behind some decent cover.
MURPHY Can you fight?
DANNY Roger that.
64.
MURPHY
Want me to take the radio?
DANNY Negative.
Murphy looks up towards Axe who is far right.
MURPHY (yelling)
AXE?!
AXE Sir!
MURPHY
Can we break that flank? Hold
this, we’re gonna push left!
Axe gets shot through the top of his shoulder the bullet tearing down through his shoulder and burning deep inside his chest.
Axe keeps firing, hitting a Taliban in the knee. The Taliban fires back at Axe missing but sending sharp rock chips shearing up off the granite into Axe’s face. Shredding his right ear, cutting into his eyeballs.
Half blind. Watery out of focus images as sweat mixed with blood. Axe struggles to see. When his vision clears up enough to focus:
AXE POV.
Two Tali fighters. Moving fast out of cover, right at AXE. Directly at the Americans. SEAL style. Attacking the counter attack.
The Taliban are close to the half blind Axe. Axe fires blind. Misses. The Taliban almost on him. Then:
One of the Tali hit with a round from Luttrell, killed. The other, wounded, falls on Axe. Vicious hand-to-hand fight.
Luttrell runs up to help Axe. Takes the remaining Taliban soldier out with a point-blank headshot.
From the right, a BELT FED MACHINE GUN opens up on their position.
Marcus and Axe start moving left. Both shot during the move - Marcus in his right butt-cheek, Axe in his right thigh.

48 EXT. ON THE MOUNTAIN 48 CHAOS.
A massive barrage of gunfire erupting from the right Taliban flank.
AXE Right is no good.
Murphy looks left. He can see twenty Taliban moving into firing positions.
MURPHY Fuck me.
The first RPG comes from the left side. Hitting just short of Danny and Murphy. Blasting them backwards. Covering them with dirt and rock.
Luttrell swings his gun left and starts firing into the left Taliban position.
Mikey? Yea? You ok?
LUTTRELL MURPHY LUTTRELL MURPHY
We’re good.
A bullet slams in Murphy’s lower stomach.
MURPHY (CONT’D) This is no good.
66.
LUTTRELL Roger that.
MURPHY
Can we break that right flank?
LUTTRELL Negative. We got to go left.
MURPHY Negative.
From downhill, two RPG’s fire at their position.
Dietz takes a shot in his upper-right chest.
A massive double RPG explosion. Tears away chunks of granite. Shrapnel cutting deep into all four SEALs. They are now clearly under attack from all three sides.
LUTTRELL
We can take ‘em Mikey but I’m
thinking we’re gonna need a new spot.
Tight on Murphy.
MURPHY Roger that.
He turns behind him giving that 50 ft. cliff a second look.
The Taliban gunfire is relentless now. Coming from all three sides.
Luttrell, Danny and Axe returning constant fire. Reloading mags. Firing away. Marcus hit for the first time in his right ass cheek.
Tight on Murphy:
MURPHY (CONT’D) We gotta fall back.
Luttrell looks at the cliff behind them.
LUTTRELL You mean fall off.
67.
MURPHY
Roger that. Fall off. Danny can you
move?
DANNY No problem.
Axe?
MURPHY
AXE Good to go.
As the four shot up SEALs turn and start to move fast towards the edge of the cliff. The pitch causing them to run and start falling immediately. Danny’s legs giving out, buckling as he hurls himself up and over the ledge.
Marcus turns to Murphy.
Luttrell, Murphy and Axe do the same. For a second they look like four country boys cliff jumping into a lake. Except for the blood streaming from necks and guts and legs, the bullet tracers flying all around them...
They fly off the cliff and it looks kind of beautiful. Freeing...until.
48A IMPACT. BOTTOM OF 1ST CLIFF 48A
Bone crushing. Concussive. Violent beyond words. Human bodies smashing into rock. Tearing through trees. Bouncing. Broken bones and smashed faces. Helmets fly off. The SEALs crash and bounce and flip. Finally settling hard on a reasonably flat part of the cliff. 300 yards below.
48B SILENCE. BOTTOM OF 1ST CLIFF 48B
Tight on Luttrell. Face down. The first to move.
Face lifts. Nose clearly broken. Luttrell looks to his left.

LUTTRELL Let me see it.
Pulling up Murphy’s shirt revealing a decent gut shot. Marcus looks for his med kit.
LUTTRELL (CONT’D) Lost my med kit.
MURPHY Where’s your gun?
Luttrell looks down. To his left, then right. Spots his gun ten feet away in the dirt.
69.
LUTTRELL
God’s looking out for us.
MURPHY
If this is looking out for us I
don’t want to see him pissed.
LUTTRELL
We’re doing good Mikey we just

Luttrell interrupted by a series of severe incoming RPG’s. Blasting all around them.
Luttrell and Murphy dive behind some fallen trees. Looking up.
MURPHY

Trees start burning.
A metal hook - RPG debris - spears into Luttrell’s right side.

Axe shot up getting to his feet. The Taliban shooting down at him.
MURPHY (CONT’D) Axe! Here! Move it buddy. Run!
Axe sees Murphy behind the trees. Charges to the hide.
70.
AXE This sucks.
No hesitation - Axe slams a fresh magazine into his M4 starts firing up the hill. Marcus is looking back to Danny.
Danny is dead still. No movement.
Axe provides cover as Luttrell and Murphy, dodging RPG’s and a hailstorm of AK fire, grabbing an alive but seriously fucked up Danny.
Picking Danny up they start hauling him back to the tree for cover.
TIGHT on Danny as a Bullet slams through his right rib cage
DANNY

mashed teeth) Goddamn this sucks.
Luttrell and Murphy slam into the tree hide propping Danny up.

Danny stares back down at his bleeding, mangled hand, then at his gun.
DANNY (muttering to himself)
Mess up my drawing hand, that pisses me off.
Danny raises his gun uphill, takes aim at a Taliban fighter jumping from rock to rock. Danny fires killing the Taliban. Re-aims, fires, kills a second. Re-aims, fires, kills a third.
Looks to Marcus.

This is a sequence. Watching the men run. Legs buckling. Knee caps smashing on rock. Slipping falling helping each other. Incoming rounds tearing past them. Daytime trace fire.
The SEALs charge across the side of the mountain.
Breathing is hysteric. High-pitched wheezing and gagging. They are literally running cross a burning mountain for their lives.
Luttrell first to stop. Tight on Luttrell.
LUTTRELL Gotta fucking rest.
Axe collapses next to him, then Murphy, then Dietz. All four SEALs gasping and choking for air.
A moment of desperate attempts to get air.
AXE Need some water.
MURPHY
We got to get to the village. Got
to.
LUTTRELL
Got to.
MURPHY
Fuck.
Dietz is by far the worst. Trying to breath. Blood loss starting to weaken him.
Murphy pulls out his sat phone, tries to get a signal.
74.

Hold this for a couple of beats. A brief silence. A pause.

A torrent of incoming gunfire blocking his advances. Luttrell twenty feet to his right trying to do the same.
Axe staying below. Firing up the hill. HITS two TALIBAN as they move down the hill towards Murphy and Luttrell.
ON LUTTRELL.
The incoming fire has him pinned against a rock.
He is desperate to find a way back up the hill. Peering around each side of the giant boulder.
TWENTY FEET to his left Murphy is doing the same.
They start moving and covering for each other. One shoots while the other moves fast to a higher covering rock.
This is a desperate, clawing uphill mountain scramble. Two men, like animals brutally determined to reclaim their fallen brother.
Tight on their hands, eyes, feet, sweat, blood and tears as they crawl their way, inch by inch back up this brutal rock mountain.
84.
56A
They are able to ascend about thirty feet before they run out of cover.
MURPHY and LUTTRELL side by side. Bullets exploding all around them.
Murphy’s got SAT phone out again trying to get a signal. He’s got no line of sight. Can’t make the call.
LUTTRELL I don’t know Mikey.
MURPHY
There’s just so fucking many of
them.
LUTTRELL
I don’t think we can get him.
Fuck.
MURPHY
LUTTRELL We got to get down.
Yea.
MURPHY
LUTTRELL
Got to get to flat ground.
Tight on Murphy taking in the entire situation. Taliban all around them. His gun shots. Axe. Down hill fighting. Covering them.
Murphy studies the terrain. A jagged rock peak sticking out in the clear about fifty feet to his left.
MURPHY I know.
LUTTRELL
We can’t get him Mikey.
MURPHY We can get him.
LUTTRELL
We’re gonna die if we don’t get off
this mountain.
MURPHY We’re gonna get him.
85.
Murphy’s fixated on the exposed rock area fifty feet above him.
He looks down hill to Axe. Desperately trying to keep the Taliban from getting at Luttrell and Murphy.
MURPHY (CONT'D)
I’m gonna get us some help Marcus.
AXE
Mike, they’re coming straight above
you and to your right.
Murphy, SAT phone in hand, looks below to Marcus.
MURPHY
I’m gonna get this call out.
LUTTRELL
Good luck on that one brother.
MURPHY Marcus, look at me.
Luttrell turns locks eyes with Murphy.
MURPHY (CONT’D) I’m gonna make the call.
Marcus looks past Murphy to the clear rock face above him. Luttrell gets what Murphy is saying, what he’s about to do.
LUTTRELL I’m sorry Mike.
MURPHY For what bro?
Marcus takes a beat, looks away, then back at Murphy.
LUTTRELL
That we haven’t killed more of ‘em.
MURPHY
Oh we’re gonna kill more of them.
Bet on that Marcus. We’re gonna kill a lot more of them.
LUTTRELL Roger that.
Murphy digs into his pack, has three remaining mags, hands them to Luttrell. Luttrell slides them into his vest. Murphy checks his M4, SAT phone in his left hand, M4 in his right.
86.
He turns to Marcus, tears in both of their eyes.
MURPHY
Never out of the fight Marcus.
Never.
LUTTRELL
Murphy turns, pushes up and simply stands. Completely exposed. He starts running uphill to the exposed rock, hitting send on the SAT phone.
Luttrell and Axe lay down cover as Murph charges up the hill, taking repeated rounds. Legs, arms, guts, Murphy makes it to the clearing, the SAT connection locks in. Murphy sits on a rock oblivious to the incoming rounds.
57 INT. TOC - J-BAD 57 In the TOC a SAT phone rings. Hasslert, sitting by the
communications equipment, stares at it, picks it up.
HASSLERT J-Bad TOC --
ON THE MOUNTAIN, MURPHY’S CLEAR ROCK FACE.
MURPHY
Sir this is Lieutenant Mike Murphy. Spartan 01. We need immediate air support, immediate air support.
Hasslert freezes for a microsecond. Then.
HASSLERT
Roger Murphy. Can I have your ten
digit grid.
Hasslert hears gunfire and Murphy impaired breathing.
MURPHY (vo on phone)
We need help now! Need immediate CAS.
HASSLERT
Roger that, I need your ten digit
grid.
MURPHY (vo on phone)
We are headed down the ravine toward the Chichakel village.
87.
Hasslert immediately on his computer firing on the secure intercut comms link, “micro chat”.
Tight on Screen. As he types TIC! Troops in contact!
HASSLERT
Murphy can you get me the grids?
MURPHY
Please hurry. Sir. Thank you.
In the TOC men start looking over as Hasslert types in the call for help.
HASSLERT
Jesus, I think we need the QRF.
Tight on the computer screen,
‘Troops in Contact’ ‘Murphy in Trouble’.
Tight on Erik Kristensen, eyes wide...reading the call for help.
He grabs the phone.
Let’s move guys. Let’s really move!
58 EXT. MOUNTAIN - MURPHY’S CLEARING 58 Back to Murphy, SAT phone dead. He turns faces up hill as two
bullets rip into his chest. He keeps firing.
Murphy starts moving up hill firing into the Taliban mass. It’s a suicide march...
Luttrell falls back to Axe as Murphy, multiple gun shots keeps firing.
Murphy falls to his knees, screaming in pain...as Taraq and his soldiers move in.
Murphy slams his final magazine, blood pouring through his NYFD patch, running down both arms. Murphy raises his M4, one last full auto burst, hits three Taliban, as a final shot slams through the front of Murphy’s face blowing him backwards, completely flipping him head over heels landing on his face.
KRISTENSEN
88.
Eyes still open Murphy’s last vision is his Iridium SAT phone. He can die knowing that he was able to make the call.

Hasslert charging toward Musslemen.

HASSLERT

Musslemen looking around realizing the Apaches are not there.

stepping down the mountain. He’s following blood drops.
Tight on beaded stone necklace with seven American Dog Tags hanging from it like human scalps.
Tight on a blood soaked dog tag: “Danny Dietz”
We move across the faces of several of these Afghan warriors They feel more like Comanche Indians than anything else.
Fierce and focused, guns up, they hunt Americans.
70A FURTHER DOWN: 3RD CLIFF EDGE ABOVE VILLAGE 70A
Luttrell and Axe at a major cliff edge, looking back up...guns pointed up mountain.
We pull wide and see just how close Taraq now is to Luttrell and Axe, 100 ft. away, max. Closing in.
On Luttrell - hearing Taraq and his men, whispering to Axe.
LUTTRELL
Come here Axe. Let me see you.
Axe nods, blood slow running from his head shot down the back of the neck. Axe touches the wound.

LUTTRELL
Fifteen minutes brother. Stay

AXE I’ll do it.
LUTTRELL Stay quiet.
A nod from Axe and the two men split up.
Axe moves to his left, Luttrell to his right.
Tight on Axe. Shot up. Blood pouring from head wound. Tough. Grinding it out. Staying low. Deep breathing. Grunting as he crosses the mountain.
Gun fire erupts around him. Turning, spots half a dozen Taliban on him.
Axe pushes deeper into the woods. A hunted animal running out of options.
LUTTRELL
The same. Moving quiet in the other direction.
97.
This is all very silent. Tense....Taraq like a hunting dog, dead quiet, Luttrell and Axe, the hunted, desperately trying to stay quiet.
On Luttrell - trying to move towards a large rock...
His right foot digging in for traction, dislodges a small pebble... on that pebble picking up momentum, hitting smaller pebbles, dislodging more little rocks... A mini avalanche, hitting a bigger rock.
Tight on Luttrell.
Looking down at the small rock slide, hearing its noise....
Shit.
LUTTRELL (CONT’D)
And they open fire again, bullets firing all around Luttrell, both Luttrell and Axe return fire. This is much closer gun fighting...grenades and RPG’s at close quarters. Men behind rocks, guns blazing.

The 47 pulls up, high hover, 80 ft. drop. Tight on Kristensen
His hands around the fast rope....
KRISTENSEN

Shane Patton, can’t help but grin, he’s on his feet moving towards the open door.

SHANE PATTON Couldn’t be more good.
KRISTENSEN
Glorious opportunity here, Mr.

SHANE PATTON

Kristensen has one foot out of the chopper when... Movement on the ground.
50 Cal gunner catches the reflection of something metallic, a small detonation from the ground. Then terrifying sights of incoming ordinance.
RPG!
50 CAL GUNNER
Tight on Kristensen and Patton looking down as the RPG round flies into the chopper right past them, literally into the 47.
99.
74 EXT. A MOMENT OF SILENCE, THEN... 74 The Chinook explodes.
Ripping apart, tilting, rotor blades immediately tearing into treetops then thick tree trunks - like massive buzz saws - the chopper turns and burns.
99A.
Rocks and trees churn, bodies break and burn and die as the big Chinook 47 rips apart exploding and tumbling down the mountain.
DOWN RANGE:

PILOT No fucking way.

SEAL LT.
As the SEALs on the chopper start breaking out the windows firing their M-4’s out the window, Airforce gunmen open up the 50 cals. Massive fire power blasting out from the choppers.
76 MOUNTAIN ABOVE VILLAGE - LATE DAY 76
Marcus looking cross mountain at Axe who has managed to transverse one hundred feet of the mountain and is leading a small pack of Shah’s men away from Luttrell.
Axe starts taking heavy fire. Shot twice through the throat. Falling backwards. Trying to get up. Back to his weapon.
AXE DYING.
Marcus watching helpless from across the mountain. Trying to cover Axe as the Taliban move in on him.
Not all of them have followed Axe because as Marcus turns back an RPG blows ten feet in front of him. Shrapnel and rock smashing into the side of his head.
His Helmet tears off his head.
100.
Tight on Marcus rolling backwards. Falling. Tumbling further down the mountain.
Tight on his helmet, Texas flag painted bold across it. Rolling and smashing down the mountain.
He comes to a hard stop slamming the back of his exposed head into a rock.
Tight on Marcus. Close to unconscious. Very dazed, Very confused.
MARCUS POV.
Distorted visuals. Triple vision. No sound except emerging high pitched ringing. Marcus is deaf.
He stares up at this apoplectic mountain in dazed wonder. 76A OMIT 76A

Taraq and his men hear the incoming Apaches.
Shah orders his men to take cover. The Taliban quickly becoming invisible from the sky.
83B DOWN HILL: 83B
Marcus deaf to the incoming Apaches. Has no idea how close they are. As he falls, gets up, off balance stumbles off a 30 ft drop.
This time not so lucky with his landing, comes down hard, shatters his right shin, bone tears through his skin, compound fracture.
Screaming in pain, Luttrell crawls into a rock crevasse. Hiding, he attempts to clear his head.
We play all of Luttrell’s audio perspective here as deaf. Abstract surges of sound. He’s basically deaf.
The Apaches fly high over head. Missing Luttrell. Disappearing over mountain tops as they keep moving to avoid enemy ground fire.
Struggling to silence his hysterical breathing, Luttrell hides as Taraq and his men move all around him. Luttrell sees shadows of the fighters. He silently starts covering himself with rocks and dirt.
Luttrell well hidden.
We slowly push in on him as his head starts to nod forward. He lifts it. Fighting the powerful urge for sleep. It falls again. He lifts it. Leaning his head back against the crevasse wall.
Taraq and his men back on the hunt. Searching rock to rock.
Tight on Luttrell. Head back. Breathing slower. As Luttrell falls to sleep.
FADE TO BLACK.

STUNNING SUNRISE.
84 INT. LUTTRELL’S HIDE 84
TIGHT ON MARCUS. Looks DEAD. EYES TWITCH. SLOWLY OPEN. LUTTRELL wakes up.
Disoriented. First thing he notices is the bird sitting up on a rock above him. He hears it. Sort of. Faded. Loud then silent. His hearing has partially returned.
LUTTRELL very slowly clears himself from the dirt and rock hide.
Inventories himself, his weapons.
Two magazines, two grenades. No food. No water.
Bleeding has stopped from his gunshot. Leg is fucked up. Shin bone busting out.
Luttrell sits down. Examining his leg. Probing the bone. Rips off his pants exposing his broken leg in UA shorts. Tears welling he bites down on his lips as he resets the broken bone. Jamming it back inside his skin.
Tucking back the bone.
Luttrell packs the puncture wound with dirt. Starts massaging his dead legs. Forcing blood back into them. Deep powerful breathing as he starts to will his body back into life.
104.
85 EXT. LUTTRELL’S HIDE 85
Luttrell slowly moves out of the hide scanning the area for any sign of Taraq or Shah.
Luttrell sees nothing.
The village is close. Couple of hundred yards.
LUTTRELL moves out. Slowly picking his way down towards the village.
At fifty yards Luttrell pulls up. Takes cover behind some rocks. Stares down at the village through his M4 scope.
LUTTRELL’S POV
Early morning. Women light fires.
Buckets of water.
Tight on Luttrell’s blistered, cracked bone dry lips as he stares through his scope at the water.
We can feel his desperate thirst.

His finger slowly off the trigger.
Luttrell lowers his weapon. Looks to his left. LUTTRELL’S POV.
A faint dirt trail below him leading away from the village.
Slowly and silently Luttrell moves out towards that trail.
Away from the village.
TRACKING with Luttrell. Slow going. He starts to put distance between himself and the village.

He’s running out of gas.
Falling, crawling...grinding it out.
He falls. On his hands and knees. Stops, head down. Hears something. Lifts his head. Looks off to his left. A WOLF.
Male, large and powerful.
The wolf studies Luttrell.
Luttrell studies the wolf.
108.
No menace just mutual curiosity.
Luttrell picks himself up.
Studies the wolf closely.
Water drips off the side of the Wolf’s face. His coat seems wet.
Luttrell turns. Listens.
HEARS the SOUND of falling water.
TRACK with Luttrell towards the sound of the water.
Luttrell moves to 20 ft. waterfall, pouring into a beautiful clear pool of crystal clear fresh water.
Luttrell tries to slide down the steep cliff sides of the water pool.
Too excited, moving too fast, Luttrell slips, falling, tumbling. He falls fast into the water.
UNDERWATER.
Luttrell cuts through the water. Like a baptism as the cool water surrounds him. Luttrell stays under water. Eyes closed. Feeling it.
Finally comes up.
SURFACES.
Swims to the shore on his hands and knees.
LUTTRELL drinks. And drinks......
Slurping like a broken animal.
Grabbing for hunks of water plants. Luttrell eats. Shoving the plants into his mouth. Desperate for any kind of energy.
TIGHT on LUTTRELL.
Slowly freezes. Senses something.
Slowly looks up.
LUTTRELL’S POV:
Three Afghan men. One man we recognize as Gulab.

A young Afghan boy.
NOT Taraq’s crew.
Three different men.
One holds a machete.
Luttrell stares back
A moment of silence.

Holds the armed grenade.
The Afghan men appear non pulsed.
Staring down at this broken SEAL. at these men.

a grenade.
LUTTRELL Stay back.
The men just stare with curiosity. Luttrell holds up his grenade.
LUTTRELL (CONT’D)
I don’t care. You understand? I don’t care. I will kill us all.
Finally one of the Afghans. A 30 year old male GULAB, the leader, strong rugged handsome, steps forward. Hands up in peace.
GULAB Not Taliban.
Luttrell studies Gulab. Looks deep into his eyes.
Luttrell looks from Gulab to the other Afghan men. Their faces seem kind. Nothing like the death looks we have seen from the Taliban.
GULAB (CONT’D)
Come.
Gulab slowly stepping to and reaching for Luttrell. Voices heard from deeper into the woods.
Taraq and his crew getting closer.
One of Gulab’s men says something quiet to Gulab.
110.
Gulab reaches his hand out to Luttrell... Luttrell looks deep into Gulab’s eyes.
Armed grenade in one hand, Luttrell slowly reaches his right bleeding hand out.
Tight on two hands grabbing each other.
As they pull him up, out of the stream, voices of Taraq and his men suddenly much closer.
Gulab whispers something to one of his men.
Luttrell is quickly pushed down into a crevasse between two rocks.
A young Afghan boy sits on top of Luttrell hiding him further.
Luttrell eyes wide, clutching his grenade.
The young boy gently patting Luttrell’s back, trying to calm him.
YOUNG BOY (whispering)
Shuuuu....shuuuuu
As Taraq with three Taliban fighters crest the cliff looking down at the pond.
At Gulab and his three men. A young boy sitting on a rock.
A stare off as the armed Taliban look down at the unarmed Gulab and his Villagers.
TARAQ (not particularly
friendly)
From what Village are you?
GULAB

In the CREVASSE.
Luttrell is freaking out. Hyperventilating. The young boy keeps gently patting his back. Taraq studies Gulab on more beat.
TARAQ

Signals that it is clear.
Gulab quickly moves to a very confused Luttrell, pulling him out of the crevasse.
LUTTRELL
Why are you helping me?

No Taliban.
On Luttrell as the Afghans quickly move him into the woods, The little Afghan boy continues patting Luttrell’s leg for comfort.
91 INT. BAGRAM AIR BASE. CJSOTF 91

The Village. Men women, children, animals all staring at this Giant broken American. An alien entering their world.
Marcus staring back in equal confusion. Locking eyes with a 90 year old woman.
The young boy by his side points to the woman. Has a conversation with her. Pointing to Marcus’s Texas leg.

Taraq studies Gulab a beat, then without warning smashes him in the side of the face. Gulab takes a knee. Looks up.

Luttrell tries to fight back. He is too weak, he is kicked and pounded viscously by Taraq and his men. Grenade just out of reach.
Luttrell is flipped on his back. Arms and legs held down as Taraq gets on top of him, knife out.
TARAQ
What base are you from?
Luttrell’s head held back, neck exposed, Taraq moves in with the blade.
TARAQ (CONT’D) What unit are you from?
When the door is kicked open.
Gulab AK-47 aimed at Taraq, two armed villagers behind him. From the windows, an old man with a shotgun. Screaming and chaos. Eight armed Afghans in a small room. Screaming at each other. Guns up.
Taraq freezes. Out the window he sees five more of Gulab’s villagers - guns up.

GULAB
Stay away from this village.
TARAQ
Da yao Americayee da para ba taso toll mrey. Aya taso powhegey

They stare inches apart. Taraq smiles, orders his men out. Taraq stops, turns back, faces the entire village.
TARAQ
You have all made your
choice, you have declared your side and for this all men, women, children will be slaughtered. All of you.

This bed is on fire
With passionate love
The neighbours complain about the noises above
But she only comes when she's on top

[Verse 2]
My therapist said not to see you no more
She said you're like a disease without any cure
She said I'm so obsessed that I'm becoming a bore, oh no
Ah, you think you're so pretty

[Verse 3]
Caught your hand inside a till
Slammed your fingers in the door
Fought with kitchen knives and skewers
Dressed me up in women's clothes
Messed around with gender roles
Line my eyes and call me pretty

[Verse 4]
Moved out of the house, so you moved next door
I locked you out, you cut a hole in the wall
I found you sleeping next to me, I thought I was alone
You're driving me crazy, when are you coming home

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me (What would you do?)
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular? (Tell me, would you?)
Well, baby, I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl (Like you)
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you (Saying ""I do"")
Because

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sittin' on the grass, layin' side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot
My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot, my love
Love, girl, my love, my love

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Now If I wrote you a love note
And made you smile at every word I wrote (What would you do?)
Would that make you wanna change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team? (Tell me, would you?)
See, what's the point in waitin' anymore?
'Cause girl, I've never been more sure (That, baby, it's you)
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you been waitin' for (Just say it, ""I do"")
Because

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side

Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love (So don't give away)

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Shawty cool as a fan, on the move once again (Ay)
But he still has fans from Peru to Japan
Hey, listen, baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan (Nah)
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can
'Cause the girls worldwide throw they hands up high
When you wanna come and kick it with a stand-up guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen with a man so fly
And, babe, with friends so fly, I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle my B.I
They call me Candle Guy (Why?)
Simply 'cause I am on fire (Haha)
I hate to have to cancel my vacation, so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gon' try (Nah)
You don't come, I ain't gon' die
Hold up, what you mean you can't go? Why? (Why?)
Me and your boyfriend, we ain't no tie (Uh-huh)
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high (Man)
Baby, it's obvious that I ain't yo' guy
I ain't gon' lie, I'll fill your space
And forget your face, I swear I will
St. Barths, Anguilla, anywhere I chill (Nice)
Just bring with me any pair, I will (C'mon)

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand

Like, since I been kinda winning, I been condescending
I been spending Earth, Wind and Fire

Albeit, I'm being heartless
Done fought so many demons, I'm exhausted

318,Cannonball,"[Chorus]
I don’t know what was wrong
But I wasn’t as strong
I’ve seen daisies hold cannonballs above them
But if this was a dream
I still know that I’ve seen
Fields of daisies hold cannonballs above them

[Poetry Section]
I’m so far from perfect
You still loved me when I so far from deserved it
If I’m so brave why does looking you in the eye take every ounce of my courage?
I hang my face to the linoleum and count the freckles on the floor
All of us, all of us are a galaxy of tiny little storms
The good and evil in me wage a bloody civil war
The missiles whistle through me then the rebel pistols roar
I shiver and the final slivers of my chivalry retreat my shriveled core
I can’t imagine that I’ll ever be happy like before
Before, before
We’re sitting in a field in Golden Gate Park off Fulton and 4th
And I’ve never felt less alone
Just a block from the home I’ve outgrown
Five feet and forty years to the right from where dad proposed
An inch above this casserole of stones, grass and mud, rusty needles, lost guitar picks, Indian tombs, and dinosaur bones
Everything happened all at once
And the world is spinning like a hubcap, and not just because of the drugs
We hugged and laid there in each others’ arms all night
Even when the sprinklers cried on us we didn’t mind
We had the rest of our lives to be dry
So we stayed until the edges of the sky turned light
I would have stayed until our hair turned white
The mosquitoes arrived to feast on time
Got drunk at our expense, we didn’t mind
We let them bite, we kept on kissing and obliged
Say “bottoms up, you’ve only got til Tuesday so enjoy the ride!”
And I couldn’t imagine that I would ever be unhappy again
And I whispered in your ear that this moment is already a poem
That I just figured out my first tattoo was going to be of bug bites
Decided I’d commemorate their bloody drink by printing three circles on my ankle, perfect and pink in permanent ink
The beautiful wounds that will keep me, you and this moment forever linked
To remind me when I fail myself, when I fail everyone around me
When I misfire and come tearing through your walls
When the cocktail of humiliation and pain poisons my veins
And this carnival of carnage, this mansion of garbage, this parking lot of carcasses, this heartbreak party drains the spirit that remains
That I have been a part of something worthwhile
To remind me of the pleasure of your pulse
The measure of your breath
The rise and fall of our fortunes and our chests
These spectacular triumphs and flops
That even if that moment meant nothing to the universe, it’s the closest thing to God I’ve got
I’m so far from perfect
So far it’s been worth it

[Bridge]
But if this was a dream
I still know that I've seen
Fields of daisies hold cannonballs above them

Me, my brother, and my mother
So if you don't mind, you can step the FUCK off, POPS.. FUCK YOU!

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Had to play catch by myself, what a sorry sight
A pitiful plight, so I pray for a starry night
Please send me a pops before puberty
The things I wouldn't do to see a piece of family unity
Moms always work, I barely see her
I'm startin to get worried without a pops I'll grow to be her
It's a wonder they don't understand kids today
So when I pray, I pray I'll never grow to be that way
And I hope that he answers me
I heard God don't like ugly well take a look at my family
A different father every weekend
Before we get to meet him they break up before the week ends
I'm gettin sick of all the friendships
As soon as we kick it he done split and the whole shit ends quick
How can I be a man if there's no role model?
Strivin to save my soul I stay cold drinkin a forty bottle
I'm so sorry...

Moms had to entertain many men;
Didn't wanna do it but it's time to pay the rent again
I'm gettin a bit older and I'm startin to be a bother;
Moms can't stand me cause I'm lookin like my father
Should I stay or run away? Tell me the answer
Moms ignores me and avoids me like cancer
Grow up rough and it's hard to understand stuff
Moms was tough cause his papa wasn't man enough;
Couldn't stand up to his own responsibilities
Instead of takin care of me, he'd rather live lavishly
That's why I'll never be a father;
Unless you got the time it's a crime; don't even bother
That's when I started hatin' the phony smiles
Said I was an only child
Look at mama's lonely smile!
It's hard for a son to see his mother cry
She only loves you, but has to fuck with these other guys
I'm so sorry...

Man child in the promised land couldn't afford many heroes
Moms was the only one there my pops was a no-show
And ohh -I guess ya didn't know
That I would grow to be so strong
Lookin kinda pale, was it the ale or pops was wrong?
Where was the money that you said, you would send me
Talked on the phone and you sounded so friendly
Ask about school and my welfare
But it's clear, you ain't sincere hey who the hell cares
You think I'm blind but this time I see you comin, Jack!
You grabbed your coat, left us broke, now ain't no runnin back
Ask about my moms like you loved her from the start
Left her in the dark, she fell apart from a broken heart
So don't even start with that ""Born to be a father"" shit
Don't even bother with your dollars I don't need it
I'll bury moms like you left me: all alone, G
Now that I finally found you, stay the fuck away from me
You're so sorry

[Verse 4: 2Pac - impersonating his father]
I never meant to leave but I was wanted
Crossed too many people every house I'd touch was haunted
Had to watch the strangers every brother was a danger;
If I wanted to to keep you breathin, had to be out of range-a
Had to move on, done lost my name and picked a number
Made me watch my back I had no happy home to run to
Maybe it's my fault for being a father livin fast
But livin slow, mean half the dough, and you won't get no ass
Hindsight shows me it was wrong all along
I wanted to make some dough so you would grow to be so strong
It took a little longer than I thought
I slipped, got caught, and sent to jail by the courts
Now I'm doin time and I wish you'd understand
All I ever wanted was for you to be a man
And grow to be the titan you was meant to be
Keep the war fightin by the writings that you sent to me
I'm so sorry...

Instinct leads me to another flow
Every time I hear a brother call a girl a bitch or a ho
Tryna make a sister feel low
You know all of that gots to go
Now everybody knows there's exceptions to this rule
Now don't be gettin' mad, when we playin', it's cool
But don't you be calling me out my name
I bring wrath to those who disrespect me like a dame
That's why I'm talkin', one day I was walkin' down the block
I had my cutoff shorts on right cause it was crazy hot
I walked past these dudes when they passed me
One of 'em felt my booty, he was nasty
I turned around red, somebody was catchin' the wrath
Then the little one said, ""Ha ha, yeah me, bitch,"" and laughed
Since he was with his boys, he tried to break fly
Huh, I punched him dead in his eye

I hit the bottom, there ain't nowhere else to go but up
Bad days at work give you an attitude and you erupt
And take it out on me but that's about enough
You put your hands on me again I'll put your ass in handcuffs
I guess I fell so deep in love I grew dependency
I was too blind to see just how it was affectin' me
All that I knew was you was all the man I had
And I was scared to let you go
Even though you treated me bad
But I don’t want to see my kids see me gettin' beat down by daddy smackin' mommy all around
You say I'm nothin' without ya but I'm nothing' with ya
A man don't really love you if he hits ya

You wear a rag around your head
And you call yourself a ""gangsta bitch""

I saw you wildin', actin' like a fool
I peeped you out the window jumping girls after school
But where did all of this come from?
A minute ago, you was a nerd and nobody ever heard of ya
Now you a wannabe... hard
You barely know your ABC's, please
There's plenty of people out there with triggers ready to pull it
Why you tryna jump in front of the bullet (Young lady) ?
Uh, and real bad girls are the silent type

Saturday mornin' just gettin up
With a hangover smellin' like I fucked
I really can't remember cause I'm still kinda faded
So I close my eyes and thank God that I made it
Now I'm gettin flashbacks of some O.J
With a green glass, says Tanqueray
Took it to the head, gulped it down with the quickness
Now I need a bitch so I can handle my business
What do you know, a freak's in my reach
Threw her on the flo', stuck it in her deep
She's screamin and she's screamin and she's screamin, gettin hoarse
But then I busted a nut, and that was that
So kick the chorus

But them hood bitches, well they ain't no good
To another man well she might be some good cat
But homies in the hood label her as a hood rat

So those with game can fuck
And ooh, she'll clown your ass real fast, if you're quick to nut
And when you're in that thi-ing
She'll make a nigga si-ng

The finest one is on my nuts, she's blowing kisses

328,"A Deeper Love (From ""Sister Act 2"")","Act I
Intro
(General pre-show activity -- actors and techies rush about preparing to perform -- makeup, costuming, etc., a typical backstage scene.  Central curtain is closed, warmers on. Harry enters, places Spavento jacket on chair USL, pulls a flask from his pocket, turns it up to take a drink only to discover that it is empty, which he demonstrates. He slips out the stage door for a pre-show nip, obviously not the first time. Beat. Maestro discovers Spavento jacket and hat. Maestro asks people where Harry is. Everyone responds with a shaking of the head. Finally he pulls Flavio aside.)
M: George! Where the hell is Harry?
Flav: What? I don’t know! Look pal, this isn’t my issue. So he’s a no show. God knows it certainly isn’t the first time. It’s not my beef!
M: It’s your problem now. You’re Spavento!
Flav: See here, Jimmy boy, I’m Flavio and that’s that. You be Spavento, dammit! (Exit.)
M: Fine. If you want something done right you better do it yourself! (Maestro stops and thinks. Yells over his shoulder.) I’d fire the useless drunk myself if we weren't out the door after tonight.
Is: Shut up! The audience will hear, and I don’t need them knowing I’m a member of a troupe of alcoholics.
Co: You’re the biggest lush of us all, Ruth. Everyone knows you are nothing more than a two-bit washed up vaudeville tramp.
Is: Charming. Linda, try not to screw up tonight. I, on the other hand will deliver my greatest performance. I plan to parlay it into the next act of my career.
Co: I hear that the retirement home that is going in on this site is looking for people to empty the bedpans -- a job you actually have experience to perform.
M: Let’s try to get along for one more night. I just hope we can finish up before the power gets shut off. (1:50)

Scene 1
(Pantalone’s house. Audio sf/x - musical flourish. Proscenium curtain opens. Lights up. Maestro enters.)
M: Good evening ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Gilded Lily! There’s a great deal of history in this building -- most recently, plays in the grand and glorious tradition of the commedia dell-arte as performed by our troupe, I Compagni dei Gigli Dorati  -- the Company of the Gilded Lily. Sadly tonight we bid a fond adieu to this once great lady of the theater, as she is slated for the wrecking ball -- and we say hello to Shady Oaks, an exclusive retirement home for the elderly and infirm. It looks as if some of its prospective clientele are among our patrons in the audience tonight. But enough of that, lets get to the show while some of us are still young -- (Aside.) and the power is on. We open our play by introducing Pantalone, one of the vecchii of the city -- rich, powerful -- and a bit of a lech. (Pantalone comes on stage and strikes a pose and “checks out” the ladies in the audience.)  Actually, he’s a lot of a lech. Pantalone isn’t in the best mood today as he is trying to find a husband for his daughter Flaminia. His hopes rest upon the arrival of Captain Spavento, a gallant -- if not completely heroic -- Spanish mercenary due to arrive at any moment. Pantalone further hopes to unite himself in marriage to the lovely Isabella, the much younger widowed daughter of his family’s now-deceased rival -- and his son Oratio’s lover. But the Captain also has heard of Isabella’s legendary beauty, and wishes to win her love . . .  Next we meet Columbina (Columbina enters and poses), Pantalone’s hardworking and mostly trustworthy servant. Saucy, headstrong and uncompromising, she’s the perfect example of a modern working girl -- if you happen to live in the seventeenth century. As we begin our play, we find Columbina attending to her daily chores under the supervision of her master. (3:36)
(Columbina In a huff, cleaning floor on hands and knees.)
Pa: Columbina, everything needs to be perfect for Spavento tonight.  It is imperative that we make a good impression.
Pa: By the way, you missed a spot.
Co: Oh, did I?!
Pa: Hop to it -- you’re not being paid to sit around.
Co: Sitting around?! (To audience.) yes, rag in hand upon my knees, the true position of laziness. (To Pantalone.) If I’m so useless, why don’t you clean it yourself?! (Returns to cleaning.)
Pa: I certainly wouldn’t say useless, you’d be good for something down there. (Beat.)
Co: (Up in his grill.) You dirty old bastard!!!
Pa: How dare you speak to your master this way!
Co: I’m still a woman and I deserve to be treated as such!
Pa: Asking for such treatment will only dig you a deeper hole.
Co: (Raises hand to punch Pantalone.) Why I oughta . . .
Pa: (Raises fists like an old man. They circle one another like old timey boxers.) A woman in hysterics -- how typical . . .
Co: That’s it!
(They proceed to wrestle around -- she puts him in a headlock and tries to force him to the spot on the floor.)
Co: LICK IT!!! LICK IT UP!! LICK IT!!! (Pantalone bites her arm. Columbina shrieks in pain.)
Pa: How dare you pass yourself off as decent help! (Exit.)
Co: (Yells at him.) I’LL GET YOU!!! JUST YOU WAIT!!!
Scene 2
(Franceschina enters.)
Fr: Columbina, have you seen Oratio?
Co: Hello. I’m good, except for this horrid bite on my arm, thanks for asking!
Fr: What bite? Have you seen Oratio?
Co: Who cares about Oratio? Pantalone bit me! Yes, who else?! He has no respect for anyone but himself! I clean, cook and do everything for him and how does he repay me? He bites me! He’s probably rabid -- that would explain a lot. It’s time he learns a lesson.
Co: Let’s see -- how to do it … how to get back at Pantalone . . . I have it! I will convince him that his breath smells as bad as his personality!
Fr: (Interrupting.) Like rotten, atrocious, garbage reeking of death and miserable existence, with a sprinkle of desperation?
Co: Exactly!
Fr: (Eye roll -- sarcastically.) That’s a swell joke! That will really show him.
Co: But that's not all! We’ll convince the old coot that to fix his breath he must remove his nasty old teeth -- which is to say, all of his teeth.
Fr: We’ll convince him?
Co: Yes! We certainly will! Here’s how we’ll do it . . . (Whispers.)
Scene 3
(Enter Pantalone and Flaminia.)
Pa: My dear Flaminia. You have been abroad pursuing your studies for the last decade, but now it is time for you to marry.  You should have no trouble attracting a husband, as you look just like your mother. She possessed a unique beauty that was without compare in all of Italy . . .
Co: (To Franceschina.) Without compare? I’ve seen things in the sewer she reminded me of . . .
Pa: To that end, it is my intention tonight to present you to none other than the famous Captain Spavento, the great Spanish soldier of fortune and world traveller. You are a rare treasure . . .
Co: (To Franceschina.) One man’s treasure is another man’s trash . . .
Pa: . . . and you will be quite happy with him.
Flam: But father, I had hoped that you might reconsider Flavio’s offer of marriage --
Pa: Pish-posh. Flavio is just as loony as his thankfully deceased father No more of this . . . it is only a matter of time before our guest of honor arrives, and you will soon join him in holy wedlock.
Co: (To Franceschina.) More like unholy deadlock . . .
Pa: And once I ask the beautiful -- and more importantly -- available -- Isabella to marry me, (Columbina’s ears prick up.) we can plan a double wedding. Until then, let us go prepare for his arrival.
Flam: But isn’t Oratio in love with Isabella?
Pa: Our Oratio is little more than a boy -- if not physically, then certainly mentally. His feelings for Isabella are only a fleeting whim. What Isabella and I will have together will be forever. (Turning to Columbina.) Columbina, you and that spleeny, knock-kneed gossipmonger must have something you could do to occupy your idleness?
Co: Well we do, master. (Pantalone and Flaminia exit SL.) (1:20) I hate Pantalone.  A better name for him would be -- Poopalone . . . (Both laugh.)
Fr: No, no. More like . . .  Fulla-balon-ay (Both laugh louder.)
Co: I’ve got it: sleeps-alone-ay . . . (Both laugh even louder.)
Co: Don’t go far -- I’ll need your help once I put my plan into action. I just need to talk to a few people first. (Enter Doctor SR.) Speaking of which . . .
Scene 4
Dr: Columbina dear, Could you go and fetch your master for me?
Co: Why?
Dr: I must speak with him about a private fiduciary issue.
Co: What would you give me in return?
Dr: Are you suggesting a quid pro quo arrangement?
Co: Possibly. Could you perhaps partake in a prank?
Dr: That all depends.
Co: On what?
Dr: On whether my participation in said prank will lead to my ipso facto instantaneous remuneration of incurred arrearage.
Co: (Angry.) Your what?!
Dr: Whether I receive the 25 scudi Pantalone owes me.
Co: Oh. I thought for a minute you were getting fresh.
Dr: What is the strategem? (Columbina whispers the plan.)
Dr: How absolutely devious. I can agree to that . . . but only if it will get me my money.
Co: (Lying.) How could it fail? But he is busy now. Can you call back in fifteen minutes?
Dr. I shall return forthwith. (Doctor exits SR.) (1:00)
Scene 5
Who else can I enlist in my plan? (Flavio enters SR.) Oh. Ask and ye shall receive.
Flav: Columbina, I’m desperate -- I need your help.
Co: Well, that’s convenient, Master Flavio, as I need your help.
Flav: I’m afraid I’m not much of a mood.
Co: What’s the matter?
Flav: I have loved Flaminia since we spent our youthful summers together -- and Pantalone, because of his hatred of my father, is attempting to thwart our love.  I have heard that he plans to marry her off to some soldier from far away. How can I compete with that? If I could only do something to make him change his mind and allow her to marry me.
Co: Really?! I don’t know about that, but maybe we can get back at him.
Flav: How?
Co: I need help planning a trick on him.
Flav: What type of trick?  (Too loudly.) I love tricks! (Columbina whispers the trick.)
Flav: Wow. I can do that. But, Columbina . . .
Co: What?
Flav: What about Flaminia? Can you help me win her hand?
Co: Let me think, and I’ll let you know later what I’ve come up with.
Flav: I will. (Exit Flavio.) (1:10)
Scene 6
Co: Now who else? (Realization.) Maybe I can use this new information to enlist Flaminia into my plan. Oh -- and I’ll talk to Oratio. He is so simple, Pantalone will certainly believe him. (Oratio crosses L to R, clearly going out for the day.) My lord Oratio, may I have a word with you?
Or: Certainly -- but make it quick. I have a date.
Co: I have sub-par news for you.
Co: Your father has fallen in love.
Or: Really? How wonderful! With who?
Co: Isabella.
Or: Isabella who?
Co: Your Isabella.
Or: No, that doesn’t make any sense. My dog Isabella died last year, Columbina. And anyway, that’s disgusting.
Co: No, stupid! Your Isabella, the human!
Or: Wait, my Isabella? That’s really disgusting!
Co: I’m afraid so. He wants to send you away to school and then (Gestures swooping.) swoop in.
Or: Why would someone as smart as me need to go to school?
Co: (Gently, clearly aware that Oratio is stupid.) I guess it’s just to get you out of the way?
Or: Yes, that must be it.
Co: Would you be willing to play a trick on Pantalone to teach him a lesson?
Or: What is it?
Co: I need you to talk to him and make him think he has bad breath.
Or: Yes -- (Sudden realization.) Oh! You should ask Flaminia -- she loves to play tricks too.
Co: That is an excellent idea, master -- (Aside) especially considering that you came up with it.
Or. This sounds fun. But what will I say? I sometimes forget things, Franceschina.
Co: I’m Columbina.
Or: Right.
Co: I’ll go find a pen and make you a list. (Thinking out loud to self -- really out loud.) Then I will find Arlecchino and get him to pretend to be a dentist and rip Pantalone’s teeth out of his stupid head.
Or: What?
Co: Nothing. (This answer satisfies Oratio.) Let’s meet back here in a little bit.
Or: Okay. After that, I must go to find Isabella (Exit Columbina.)

Scene 7
(Enter Isabella.)
Or: Isabella -- we need to talk. I’m glad you’re home.
Is: Oratio, this is your home. I came to see you.
Or: (Uncertainly.) Oh.
Is: I worry when you are out by yourself. You remember how you got so lost last time you went out, don’t you?
Or: Oh yes. And I never found any candy.
Is: I know. I tried to tell you where all the -- candy -- was, but you never listen, do you? (She comforts him).
Is: Tell me what’s wrong, Oreo. You look so stricken.
Or: My father is in love with you!
He’s sending me away to school so he can have you all to himself!
Is: No! You aren’t going are you?
Or: I don’t know. He’s my father! Maybe he knows best.
Is: No, Oratio. That would make me very unhappy. You don’t like to make me unhappy, do you? Remember what happened to my husband?
Or: Didn’t he accidentally poison himself while you were very far away and had nothing at all to do with it?
Is: Yes . . . yes, that’s right. But Oratio! You can’t leave me to your father! He’s so . . . old! You are my true love!
Or: I — I love you too, Isabella. But I could never disobey my father. I must go home. (Oratio stands awkwardly, realizing he doesn’t know where he is. Isabella begins to cry melodramatically and runs away SR. Oratio follows her. Columbina enters from SR with pen and sees that Oratio has wandered off.)
Co: Idiot! (Exits SL).

Scene 8
(The road into the city. Enter Spavento and Zanni.)
Sp: Oh Zanni, we are nearly to our destination.
Z: (Sighs.) Yes, captain. Where are we going?
Sp: We are in search of the house of the most beautiful woman ever to walk the face of the earth -- the Isabella.
Z: THE -- Isabella? But I thought you were going to meet someone named Flaminia --
Sp: Silence, Zanni! Never mention the name of that creature in the same sentence as the Isabella. Flaminia is muy fea grande . She brings to mind the horrors of the Battle of Murciélagos Viciosos!
Z: (Mutters.) The battle of vicious bats? Really?
Sp: Must I remind you of my latest incredible adventure?
Z: Oh boy here we go . . .
Sp: We were travelling across the seas aboard our mighty ship, the Gatita Rosada --
Z: Otherwise known as the Pink Kitten —
Sp: SILENCE, ZANNI! As I was saying, we were aboard the Gatita Rosada. It was a stormy night --
Z: Afternoon, sir.
Sp: -- a stormy afternoon, and we were attempting to infiltrate an enemy fortress upon the cliffs. The only way inside was through a deep, dark, cavern below the castle.
Z: Or we probably coulda just asked to go in —
Sp: ZANNI! Hand me my sword, Sujetapapeles  I am going to do my re-enactamento.
(Enter Arlecchino and Arlecchina. Arlecchina begins to mock him and Arlecchino participates and laughs.)
Z: Yes, Captain. (Hands Spavento his sword.)
Sp: As we approached the cave, I gripped my sword, Sujetapapeles, and bravely stood at the bow of the ship --
Z: (Mutters.) More like the stern --
Sp: And then, as we entered the canal, all of a sudden, thousands of dark blood bats attacked me and my ship mates! But I stood against them and slayed them all myself! (Mimes sword fighting.)
Z: But captain, it was only one little bat, remember? And I caught him, see? Look, here he is! (Pulls out of pocket.) I’ve decided to name him Pickles.
Sp: ZANNI! (Points sword at him.) You wound me, bringing back to my memory the scars of battle!
Z: (Sighs.) My apologies, Captain. (Pockets bat.)
Sp: And as I entered the canal thousands of dark blood bats attacked me and my ship mates! But I stood against them and . . . (He notices Arlecchino and Arlecchina who try to behave nonchalantly.)
Sp: (To Arlecchino.) Excuse me, young idiots in the matching vestidos . What is your names?
AO: I am Arlecchino. And this is my little sister Arlecchina.
AA: I’m twelve.
Sp: Your parents didn’t have much imagination when it came to the picking of the names.
AA: (Brandishing an invisible sword, pretending to fight.) Untrue -- I am named after the great knights of old who fought with much bravery.
Sp: (To Arlecchina.) And you?
AA: I’m named after him.
Sp. Are you from yon city?
AO: Maybe.
Sp: I am wondering if you know where is the house of the Isabella?
AO: Who wants to know?
Sp: I am Captain Spavento. (Waits for a reaction, but none is offered.) You must have heard of me, yes?
AO: I don’t think so -- should we have?
Sp: That is unusual. Maybe you know me by my full name -- El Capitano Spavento Fantastico?
Z: Oh, when did you add that last part, master?
Sp: Silence, Zanni!
AO: How do you put up with this guy?
Sp: Quiet, you!
AO: Golly!
AA: Yowzah!
Z:  Jeez, Louise.
AO: Why exactly did you come here?
Sp: I came to gaze upon the glorious cabeza  of the Isabella! Could you help?
AO: Are you sure that’s legal?
Sp: Cah-bay-sah, you idiot -- her head.
AO: Oh. I guess that’s okay. (Arlecchino and Arlecchina huddle to plan. Spavento watches anxiously.)
AO: We could give you the password . . .
Sp: (Excited.) What's the password? (Arlecchino and Arlecchina look around to make sure that nobody is close enough to hear.)
AA and AO: Cinnamon.
Sp and Z: Cinnamon?
AA and AO: Cinnamon.
AO: Welp -- gotta run. (Arlecchino and Arlecchina exit SL in a hurry.)
Sp: Did you hear, Zanni. We are close -- and now I have the password to the house of the Isabella. Let us vamanos!
Z: Coming, master. (Exit.)
Scene 9
(Enter Pantalone, followed by Columbina and Franceschina.)
Co: Master, I need to talk with you about a serious matter.
Pa: What? Are you here to apologize for your ill-treatment of me earlier?
Co: About that. (Gritting teeth.) To show you that I am sincerely sorry, I want to inform you about the latest gossip. I have lately overheard several people commenting on the awful state of your breath.
Pa: Why would I trust you to tell the truth, you mammering, ill-breeding harpy?
Co: If you don’t believe me, ask Franceschina. She is incapable of telling a lie.
Pa: I think I will. Franceschina! Get over here! (Franceschina runs over.) Tell me, would it seem my breath has departed from its usual rosy aroma? (Breathes into her face.)
Fr: (Too scared to speak.) Well, sir, maybe, umm . . .
Pa: Speak up you doe-eyed gnome.
Fr: (Emboldened.) Your breath smells of the chamber pots I’ve avoided emptying for months.
Co: I told you so.
Pa: Curious. (Enter Flavio. Exit Franceschina.)
Scene 10
Flav: Pantalone, I’d like to have a word with you!
Pa: I don’t have time for this you . . . wait a minute. Forget that -- smell my breath. (Breathes into his face.)
Flav: (Gags.) Pantalone, your breath smells like someone who beat a dead horse for twelve hours and then died. On the horse. (As Pantalone turns to breathe into his own hand to smell his breath, Flavio obviously winks at Columbina who signals to him to play it cool and they are almost seen by Pantalone, who looks that them curiously. Flavio exits.)
Scene 11
(Enter the Doctor.)
Dr: Pantalone, I need to speak with you.
Pa: Ah! Good doctor, I require your professional opinion on a certain matter.
Dr: Perhaps I would be more inclined to offer my services if I were to receive some form of monetary incentive? As I recall, you owe me 25 scudi for --
Pa: (Cutting him off and moving him away from Columbina.) We shall not discuss such matters in front of the hired help! I assure you, the issue will be settled in a professional, discreet manner.
Dr: We have not yet achieved a pecuniary quietus.
Pa: All in good time. Now! Tell me how this strikes you. (Breathes in face.)
Dr: (Gagging.) In my opinion as a practitioner of the medical arts, this is an indisputable case of mortificis halitosis , perhaps the worst I have encountered in my entire career. Ergo, you should pursue the immediate extraction of the source of that appalling insufflation.
Pa: I would request that you extract yourself from my company, you money grubbing quack.
Dr: With pleasure. But first, when I will expect my 25 scudi?
Pa: When the pit of everlasting perdition completely glaciates.
Dr. Whatever does that mean?
Pa: Figure it out on your own time. Be gone. (Doctor exits.)
Scene 12
(Enter Flaminia and Oratio. Columbina pulls Oratio to the background to coach him and ""write"" notes on his hand.)
Flam: Father, there’s something we need to talk about.
Pa: What is it, my precious?
Flam: You see, there’s something, a bit abnormal about you.
Pa: It’s certainly not the norm to be both this wealthy and modest.
Flam: Father, your breath, it’s bad. It smells like you ate a handful of stink bugs. You must fix this. (Exit USR.)
Pa: That ungrateful brat! Her tact extends no further than the end of her tiny beard. (:30)
Scene 13
(Oratio approaches Pantalone as ordered by Columbina.)
Pa: Oratio! Deformed issue of my ill-spent seed! I need your help. Does my breath smell a bit, peculiar? (Pantalone breathes in this face.)
Or: (Reads cheat notes on hand as Columbina looks as if the jig is up.) ""Possible words: Ew, foul! Feckel matter! (Pantalone: Fecal?) Bleh! Insert gagging noises. Run away."" (Oratio looks emptily at Pantalone, and exits.)
Pa: (Buying the act.) Curse these foul teeth! I must rid myself of the cause of this terrible breath! Columbina, fetch me a dentist! This ends today.
Co: (Smiling.) As you wish, master.
Scene 14
(Columbina steps US, snaps her fingers, and Arlecchino and Arlecchina enter dressed as dentists with chair and dental tools. Columbina remains.)
AO: Dentist!
AA: Dentist for hire!  Anyone need a dentist?
AO: First-class dentists, ready to pull teeth for a bargain price!
AA: We cure bad breaths!
Pa: Now that’s amazing service. Over here, kind sirs. A dental approach would certainly not be my first choice as a course of action, but one such as myself must keep up appearances. I cannot conduct myself in civilized company with such a upsetting odor radiating from my mouth.
AA: Please, come, sit in our chair! (Pulls Pantalone into the chair and forcefully pushes him down.)
AO: Now, sir, what seems to be the trouble?
Pa: Could you have a look in my mouth? There have been many complaints as of late about my terrible breath. (Both Arlecchino and Arlecchina peer into mouth and make disgusted facial expressions and gag in response to the “smell”. A appears uncomfortable.)
AO: There seems to be a great deal of rot in your lateral incisor, your second bicuspid, and uh . . .
AA: Your third bicameral!
Pa: Okay, what can be done to make my breath smell like roses again? (Looks concerned.)
AO: There’s only one solution. (Pauses.) I need the socrathesbiator! (Arlecchina nodding, hands Arlecchino a tool.) No, no, not the hippocambell realligner! The socrathesbiator! (Arlecchina looks confused, picks up a screwdriver. Arlecchino, exasperated, motions towards a giant pair of pliers in the bag.)
Pa: Okay, okay, okay, slow down. Is this going to hurt?
AO: (Looking to Arlecchina.) Not us.
Pa: In case things get too bad, what’s the safe word? (Arlecchino and Arlecchina look at him, look at each other, and then look back at him and say in unison.) “Cinnamon.”
Pa: What?
AA: (Really excited.) Let’s give him him the anesthetic! (Pantalone, alarmed, tries to get up. Arlecchina hits him on the head with a frypan, the “anesthetic”. Practical sf/x: cowbell. Arlecchino then begins pulling a tooth out with much gusto in a count of one-two-three-yank. Practical sf/x: rasp.)
Pa: “AHHHHHHHH.” Tell me good fellows -- where exactly did you get your dental degrees? (Gasping, Arlecchino and Arlecchina exchange a glance.)
AO: The anesthetic should be kicking in soon! (Arlecchino gestures to Arlecchina, she hits Pantalone with frying pan again. Practical sf/x: cowbell. Arlecchino begins pulling another tooth as before. Practical sf/x: rasp.)
Pa: “AHHHHHHHH.”
AA: Sir please! we need you to remain still we are only two tooths in!
Pa: Only two what?!
AO: Anesthetic! (Arlecchina hits Pantalone with frying pan again. Practical sf/x: cowbell. Arlecchino begins pulling third tooth while Pantalone screams. Practical sf/x: rasp.)
Pa: CINNAMON! CINNAMON! (Reaches up in pain and pulls off Arlecchino’s and Arlecchina’s beards. Realizes the beards are fake.)
AO and AA: (To each other.) Cinnamon. (Arlecchina hits Pantalone with frying pan again. Practical sf/x: cowbell. Arlecchino, Arlecchina and Columbina exit in a hurry.)
Pa: I’ll get you, you maladjusted, half-witted imbeciles -- if it’s the last thing I do! (Pantalone, in pain, drags chair off in pursuit.)",I Compagni Dei Gigli Dorati,1994,"[99, 92, 83, 68, 70, 63, 65, 72, 86]",9

333,Miss You In A Heartbeat,"I believe that there is something deep inside
That shouldn't be from time to time
I sure found out, thought love was such a crime
The more you care, the more you fall

No need to worry, no need to turn away
'Cause it don't matter, anyway
Baby

Ooh, I miss you in a heartbeat
Ooh, I miss you right away
Ooh, I miss you in a heartbeat
'Cause it ain't love if it don't feel that way

When we touch, I just lose my self-control
A sad sensation I can't hide
To love is easy; it ain't easy to walk away
I keep the faith, and there's a reason why

No need to worry, no need to turn away
'Cause it don't matter, anyway
Baby

Ooh, I miss you in a heartbeat
Ooh, I miss you right away
Ooh, I miss you in a heartbeat

And I would never want to cause you pain
I know that there is no excuse
How could I ever treat my baby that way

For a chance just to touch a hand
Or a moment to share
Can't deny the urge, that makes them
Want to lose themselves to the debonair one
Hold me back, the simple fact is
That I'm all that, and I'm always near
One sexy can't perplex me

343,All About Soul,"She waits for me at night, she waits for me in silence
She gives me all her tenderness and takes away my pain
And so far she hasn't run, though I swear she's had her moments
She still believes in miracles while others cry in vain

It's all about soul
It's all about faith and a deeper devotion
It's all about soul
Cause under the love is a stronger emotion
She's got to be strong
Cause so many things getting out of control
Should drive her away
So why does she stay?
It's all about soul

She turns to me sometimes and she asks me what I'm dreaming
And I realize I must have gone a million miles away
And I ask her how she knew to reach out for me at that moment
And she smiles because it's understood there are no words to say

It's all about soul
It's all about knowing what someone is feeling
The woman's got soul
The power of love and the power of healing
This life isn't fair
It's gonna get dark, it's gonna get cold
You've got to get tough, but that ain't enough
It's all about soul

There are people who have lost every trace of human kindness
There are many who have fallen, there are some who still survive
She comes to me at night and she tells me her desires
And she gives me all the love I need to keep my faith alive

It's all about soul
It's all about joy that comes out of sorrow
It's all about soul
Who's standing now and who's standing tomorrow
You've got to be hard
Hard as the rock in that old rock 'n roll
But that's only part, you know in your heart

345,Heaven Help/Spinning Around Over You,"Feed the family they need attention Eat the children to feed intention
Everyone's invited, so bring a friendship. Everyone's invited, bring the butter knife and tension
Born in a power plant, raised by the hour hand ... (?)... my hands for taking a salty grain of sand
Once i learned i was a domesticated package riv-aged by bargain hunters ...(?)... commodities blunders
That's when it finally dawned to me, that i was something to somebody but nothing better than property
Properly embrace the game, its a celebrity but honestly all i wanted out of life was a life that taunted me
It kept dangling dollar bills off fishing poles or driving a family sedan ...(?)...acrylic illustrations that i got hooked
But like I'd go back to that cracked aquarium I so naturally referred to as a debilitated concentration camp
Disguised in a nursing home sense of fashion I'd fasten my home and if I were because sooner or later they're coming to conquer you
They been monitoring your moves So please make a promise that you're honoring the truth

The Heat makes me breathe less. It's time to bleed dreams so the seams seem refreshed
And I no longer feel the need to be what you think is best. Don't worry you will die unimpressed
Born ahead of my time, I never relied on a promise. With development of the mind comes instinct conscience
I think things will be better when I travel further but for now I struggle through the mud
And touch what turns your curiosity around your fear and honesty but now you see it's not so bad, suffocate your frown
Mistakes might crowd the excitement you found, somebody's gotta kill the clown before the laughter's able to drown
The table is round for the square thoughts that I bring to it. Contrast, I'm last when it comes to giving in
I'm living with a vision of a prison that you sit in my decision isn't it fulfilling watching time rot away slowly
But I guess it's how you view it, but I guess it's the influence that's rooted in the uselessness
Clip your wings if you wanna know the truth, just, clip your wings if you want to know the true us

When I was born I rode a rainbow over the swamps of Jupiter. Conquered Lucifer and punched a hole in the lawless universe
It was as dark as can be. But with the faith of a star, I took a giant quantum leap and erased the mark of the beast
The fangs, the flaws I took out didn't phase my force field so I pulled the eyelids over the head and blinked until my eyes peeled
I deal with an ideal of silence and self medications to resist distractions because attractions lead to all attachments
And I'm going through withdrawal I made my way to a cave maybe i made a mistake because company never came close to inflicting their morphing identity processed dissected orange forms swarm the sunset that sinks beyond the endless horizon
I fade, I made a sacrifice, I'm hollowed out, empty. In an after-life where i exist in a hole, in a cell, in the head of a god
But there's nothing to sell now because all i found was a book that I can't
Read because the story teller is hooked in a thread we've weaved into a net
This light has a life of its own with a sweet and (?) mystery completely meant to me the needs of shadow corners
And indeed it's starting to get to me I'm sort of tipping onto one side. It's getting windy outside
And I know because the inside is dizzy. And I'm spinning around, tripping over my expectations and hitting the ground
Pitiful attempts to prevent this pretty (?) from leaving the egg before the hatch
I seem to be bleeding back into the sleepy beings whom a translucent vein that runs deeper than the roots of meaning
Soaked in laughing gas, half awake, that's how you'll find me. Putting on my happy face Asking God ""why are you crying?"" Why...Why are you crying? ""Why you crying?"" It doesn't make sense

I was born inside an open letter to be read and the message says I'm not dead
Alive and breathing, kicking bleeding within so if you cut my skin you will get a slice of heaven
Show and tell hold me now. Close to you and notice who i am one man's (?)
Standing outside in the rain-storm letting water drain down to feed my veins
Now I'm not thirsty anymore. please world don't hurt me anymore when the deserted feel the dreams that seems to be split at the seams
And (break or brake) with a... manage to bake more cake with a (...?...)
First footsteps then (finish?) (Ledger?) the gutter away from mother
So pray for sunny away from home thunder rolls lightning might strike twice never know (?) am now see. Who is he? reflection crooked and glass shattered and mirror broken. Hoping i can awaken out of this place i lay in. awaiting for what?.... Nothing

Maybe we should take some time to be apart

347,Rock My World (Little Country Girl),"[Verse 1]
She's got a T-Top Camaro with a scoop on the hood
And two big speakers blasting Johnny B. Goode
Looking so sweet it ought to be a crime
She plays with my heart and messes with my mind
Acts like Madonna but she listens to Merle
Rock my world little Country girl

She wears snakeskin boots made by Calvin Klein
And cheap sunglasses from the five and dime
All the other girls in school they give her dirty looks
She got an ""A"" in math and never cracked a book
Sure looks good in her denim and pearls
Rock my world little Country girl

[Chorus]
Rock my world
Drag me out on the floor
Dance with me till I can't dance anymore
One-step, two-step, get in a line
I gotta find a way to make you mine

[Verse 2]
I tell her that I love her but it ain't enough
She says I got to learn to loosen up
Get a little wild on Saturday night
But make sure she's home before the morning light
Sunday she's all ribbons and curls
Rock my world little Country girl

[Chorus]
Rock my world
Drag me out on the floor
Dance with me till I can't dance anymore

348,Keep Ya Head Up,"[Intro]
Little something for my godson Elijah
And a little girl named Corin

[Verse 1]
Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh, then the deeper the roots
I give a holla to my sisters on welfare
2Pac cares if don't nobody else care
And I know they like to beat you down a lot
When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep ya head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothin', don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
‘Cause, sister, you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas you up, I just call 'em how I see 'em
You know what makes me unhappy?
When brothers make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women — do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up?
I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep ya head up

[Hook]
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter

[Verse 2]
Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with a local crew and had a smoke or two
And I realize Mama really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay the rent
And in the end it seems I'm headin' for the pen
I try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems the rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up
You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours
They got money for wars but can't feed the poor
Say there ain't no hope for the youth
And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive, ‘cause it's a set-up
And even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up

[Hook]
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter

[Verse 3]
And uh, to all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em
‘Cause I think we can make it; in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more
‘Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
Hell of a hand without a man, feelin' helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dyin' inside, but outside you're lookin' fearless
While tears is rollin' down your cheeks
You steady hopin' things don't fall down this week
‘Cause if it did, you couldn't take it
And don't blame me — I was given this world, I didn't make it
And now my son's gettin' older and older
And cold from havin' the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin' Benz
I'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin' friends
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up
But please, you got to keep ya head up",2Pac,1994,"[58, 54, 50, 42, 40, 37, 24, 21, 12, 12, 14]",11

First show a little respect, change your behavior
Change your attitude, change your plan
There could never really be justice on stolen land
Are you really for peace and equality?

Take the word overseer, like a sample
Repeat it very quickly in a crew, for example
Overseer, overseer, overseer, overseer
Officer, officer, officer, officer
Yeah, officer from overseer
You need a little clarity? Check the similarity!
The overseer rode around the plantation
The officer is off, patrollin' all the nation
The overseer could stop you, ""What you're doing?""
The officer will pull you over just when he's pursuing
The overseer had the right to get ill
And if you fought back, the overseer had the right to kill
The officer has the right to arrest
And if you fight back they put a hole in your chest
(Woop!) They both ride horses
After 400 years, I've got no choices
The police them have a likkle gun
So when I'm on the streets, I walk around with a bigger one
(Woop-woop!) I hear it all day
Just so they can run the light and be upon their way

[Chorus]
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast

[Verse 3]
Check out the message in a rough stylee
The real criminal are the C-O-P
You check for undercover and the one P.D
But just a mere Black man, them wann check me
Them check out me car, for it shine like the sun
But them jealous or them vexed, ‘cause them can't afford one
Black people still slaves up 'til today
But the Black police officer nah see it that way
Him want a salary, him want it
So he put on a badge and kill people for it
My grandfather had to deal with the cops
My great-grandfather dealt with the cops
My great-grandfather had to deal with the cops
And then my great, great, great, great—when it's gonna stop?!

[Chorus]
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast",KRS-One,1994,"[100, 89, 89, 91, 90, 93]",6

355,Award Tour,"[Produced by A Tribe Called Quest]

[Chorus: Dove]
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
New York, NJ, NC, VA
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Oaktown, LA, San Fran, St. John

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
People give your ears so I be sublime
It's enjoyable to know you and your concubines
Niggas, take off your coats, ladies act like gems
Sit down, Indian style, as we recite these hymns
See, lyrically I'm Mario Andretti on the MOMO
Ludicrously speedy, or infectious with the slow-mo
Heard me in the eighties, J.B.'s on ""The Promo""
In my never-ending quest to get the paper on the caper
But now, let me take it to the Queens side
I'm taking it to Brooklyn side
All the residential Questers who invade the air
Hold up a second son, 'cause we almost there
You can be a black man and lose all your soul
You can be white and groove but don't crap the roll
See my shit is universal if you got knowledge of dolo
Or delf or self, see there's no one else
Who can drop it on the angle, acute at that
So, do that, do that, do that, that, that (come on)
Do that, do that, do that, that, that (OK)
Do that, do that, do that, that, that
I'm bugging out but let me get back cause I'm wetting niggas
So run and tell the others 'cause we are the brothers
I learned how to build mics in my workshop class
So give me this award, and let's not make it the last

[Chorus: Dove]
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Chinatown, Spokane, London, Tokyo
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Houston, Delaware, DC, Dallas

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Back in '89 I simply slid into place
Buddy, buddy, buddy all up in your face
A lot of kids was busting rhymes but they had no taste
Some said Quest was wack, but now is that the case?
I have a quest to have a mic in my hand
Without that, it's like Kryptonite and Superman
So Shaheed come in with the sugar cuts
Phife Dawg's my name, but on stage, call me Dynomutt
When was the last time you heard the Phife sloppy
Lyrics anonymous, you'll never hear me copy
Top notch baby, never coming less
Sky's the limit, you gots to believe up in Quest
Sit back, relax, get up out the path
If not that, here's a dancefloor, come move that ass
Non-believers, you can check the stats
I roll with Shaheed and the brother Abstract
Niggas know the time when Quest is in the jam
I never let a statue tell me how nice I am
Coming with more hits than the Braves and the Yankees
Living mad phat like an oversized mampi
The wackest crews try to diss, it makes me laugh
When my track record's longer than a DC-20 aircraft
So, next time that you think you want somethin' here
Make something def or take that garbage to St. Elsewhere

[Chorus: Dove]
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
SC, Maryland, New Orleans, Motown
We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand

We on Award Tour with Muhammad my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Houston, Delaware, DC, Dallas

356,John Deere Green,"[Verse 1]
They were farm kids way down in Dixie
Met in high school in the sixties
Everyone knew it was love from the start
One July, in the midnight hour
He climbed upon the water tower
Stood on the rail and painted a ten-foot heart

[Chorus]
In John Deere green
On a hot summer night
He wrote ""Billy Bob loves Charlene""
In letters three-foot high
And the whole town said that he should have used red
But it looked good to Charlene
In John Deere green

[Verse 2]
They settled down on eighty acres
Raising sweet corn, kids, and tomatoes
They went together like a hand and a glove
On a clear day from their front yard
If you look and know what to look for
Off to the east you can still read his words of love

[Chorus]
In John Deere green
On a hot summer night
He wrote ""Billy Bob loves Charlene""
In letters three-foot high
And the whole town said the boy should have used red
But it looked good to Charlene
In John Deere green

[Verse 3]
Now more than once the town has discovered
Painting over it ain't no use
There ain't no paint in the world that'll cover it
The heart keeps showing through

[Chorus]
In John Deere green
On a hot summer night
He wrote ""Billy Bob loves Charlene""
In letters three-foot high
And the whole town said the fool should have used red
But it looked good to Charlene
In John Deere green

Ah, paint it green boy

In John Deere green
On a hot summer night
He wrote ""Billy Bob loves Charlene""
In letters three-foot high
And the whole town said the boy should have used red
But it looked good to Charlene
In John Deere green

Good man's down, while a bad man's standin tall
Strongest one don't always win them all
Going crazy, going crazy

The way they do my life is going round
Never straight up, sideways, upside down
Brothers livin' six feet underground
Oh got me crazy, I'm so crazy

A poor man lives in happiness
A millionaire evil as he wanna be
A good man going hungry...
'Cause of Time and Chance

A good man's down, while a bad man's standing tall
A strong man don't always, win 'em all

Don't it hurt so bad? (Oh it really hurt so bad)
And it hurt so bad, (Tell me can you feel the pain?)
Don't it hurt so bad (Time and Chance)

It seems I don't get time out anymore
What a change if we set the pace face to face
No one even trying to score
Oh oh I can feel the magic of your touch
And when you move in close a little bit means so much
Ooh yeah, you've got to understand baby
Time out is what I'm here for

One on one I wanna play that game tonight
One on one I know I wanna play that
One on one I wanna play that game tonight
One on one so slow

I think I might know you too well
Wonder what you'd say if you knew that I was coming tonight

Something I can go to the park to
Yeah, there you go, alright
I like that, I like that
It sound dope
Bust 'em in the eye, Shaq!

[Verse 1: Shaq]
You wanna fight? Come fight me!
I'll hit ya with the ""Wa-psh-psh-psh-psh-psh!"" See, see?
I get dirty after dark
I'll treat you like Spielberg, you'll get your ass kicked in in a park (Ooh!)
You don't believe me? The proof is in the puddin'
Been a boy in the hood way before Cuba Gooding
I flip scripts with the mad pa-style, freeze
(Shhh) Music, please!
I dribble rhymes like Basketball-em's
People call me E.T. (What's that, Shaq man?), Extra-Tallem's
You better than Shaq-tack, fool, shut up, liar!
I lean on the Statue of Liberty when I get tired
Than I'll punch you in the stomach, I don't give a heck
(Hey yo, why you booger hook like that?) Yo, she breath on my neck!
People walk around like, yo, they got charged!
But I'm big like Gorilla, 6'7 ain't large!
I kick rhymes like Moo Duk Kwan Do
I smoke-smoke the mic-mic like Cheech and Chong do
You don't like Shaq? Frankly, I don't give a damn
I know I got skills man, I know I got skills man

[Verse 2: Def Jef]
Surprise, look who's back, not a prize from a Cracker Jack
Look at that, it's Def Jef with the Shaq Attack
Flexin', I'll be crackin your back with the boom-boom bap
Pass that mic over here, you ain't gon' want it back
Everybody say I got fat, yep, but so did my wallet
Still ripping rhymes and dropping bombs like Khalid Muhammad
Do yourself a solid, don't flex, you go sex
You know the time, get the high-hat, the Rolex
The way I see, if I was wack like you, I'd be at me
The way I hold it down, you'd swear my name was Gravity
Def Jef with the funk, Def Jef don't front, you know how the name is spelt
I'm making it vital, and jackin' the title, fool, break yourself
Attack the track like Shaq on a whack broad
Coming up with the hits, and I'm coming down with the backboard
Don't fake the funk, just make the sound's up from the trunk
The reason your tape ain't hit the deck is because your hits don't bump
So get back, ain't no hassle, cause you ain't holding nothin'
Keep sticking around, you get beat down like you stole something
Sleep on me and the Shaq and jump your own hand
Cause I know I got skills man, I know I got skills man

[Ad-lib]
Ah yeah, yeah, y'all don't know nothing about this

Nah, nah, let me continue

Mic-checka, the rim and rhyme wrecka, rocks from here to Mecca
(Boom!) Boom shack-a-lack-a-lack-a
I got a hand that'll rock ya cradle
Cream you like cheese, spread you on my bagel
My Ford Explorer boomin' with the trunk of funk
All you jealous punks can't stop my dunks
The brand new like Heavy, built like Chevy, Impala
But Shaq's a smooth balla
(Yeah, but what about rhymin'?) I can hold my own
Knick-knack, Shaq-attack, give a dog a bone
Rhymin is like hoopin', I'm already a legend
Back in the days in the food stamp section
Used to kick rhymes like, ""Baby, baby, baby!""
""Every once, every twice, three times a lady""
Is what I listened to, ridin' with my moms
How you like me now? I drop bombs!
When you see me, please tap my hands
I know I got skills man, I know I got skills man

362,Money In The Ghetto,"[Verse One]
In the ghetto, you think life is hard
Food stamps and to' up cars
Wall to wall dirty orange carpet
Sittin in a bucket, hopin you can start it
And ride around to the liquor store
Can't get a job get drunk some more
You betta stop trippin on dem stereotypes
Cause in the ghetto there's a good life
We ain't starvin like Marvin, won't see no roach
When ya chill wit the rich folks in the hood
You're sittin on leather watchin big screens
Bought by the dope fiends
Smokin, and what about the brother wit the good jobs
Savin money, and workin hard
Bought a house for his wife and kids
Ya only got one life to live
Another brother got some cocaine
You know his face, but don't know his name
You know he got the sack mayn
And he's sittin on a fat bank
Seven cars at his house in the driveway
Benz so clean don't roll it just fly away
Cause folks got money in the ghetto.. yeah you know

[Hook One]
Hey hey hey.. whatcha got to say (There's money in the ghetto)
Hollywoooooood! Havin money in the ghettooo

[Verse Two]
Money in the ghetto ain't nothin new
It's been like that, way before you
Was even born, get up from the down stroke
Chocolate City for the black folks
Say it loud in ya hot pants
Man child in the promised land
I take you back to Iceberg Slim
And all the players that came before him
If you a everyday hustler, get your money
Cause what they do to black man ain't funny
All the time tryin to put us the pen
You get paroled and then they send you again
All the homies in the hood gettin paid
You might have left but the money stayed
In the ghetto, it ain't all about drugs
Gettin paid doin all kinds of stuff
Only rule on the streets is don't get caught
Unless your hustle ain't breakin the law
And even though rich folks got it good
We sittin on 'em fat in the hood
I'm ridin on some gold ones
Smokin dank and it's potent
Ask them fools, cause they know
There's money in the ghetto

Chorus One

[Verse Three]
I got money baby, just tell me the price
Cause Short Dawg ain't nuttin nice
I always hit the town wit my boy Ben Franklin
Spend fo', get an ounce of dank then
Rich nigga get high relaxin
If I bust a Ben Frank' get some Andrew Jacksons
Five twenties for a hundred dollar bill
You know the math, let's make a deal
On the one dollar bill if you look on the front
You find the face of George Washington
Make money baby, that's all I do
That's how I know Thomas Jefferson is on the two
Abraham Lincoln got shot and died
Freed the slaves so they put him on the five
And Hamilton, my old time friend
They put his face on the front of the ten
These are the dead presidents
From the hood and they represent
The American dream for the average minority
Make your money, get some weed and a forty
I'm on the Eastside livin' like a king
Kick back watchin fifty-inch screens
Bounce to the Westside, hit the studio
And spend my money in the ghetto

[Hook Two]
Hey hey hey.. whatcha got to say (They got money in the ghetto)
Hollywoooooood! Havin money in the ghettooo

[Verse Four]
Nowadays if you can't say a rap, or play sports
You might just come up short
And they always say the same things
Don't be a gangster or a dopefiend
Get your high school diploma, go to college
Get a degree and start makin' dollars
Only one thing wrong, and it's a Trip
Inner city schools don't teach us shit
Got us stuck on stupid, Straight S.O.S
Can't get nothin, but they payin the rest
Of them fools
All Around the world in the other countries
They should be spendin that money right here
In the state of California
You graduate and can't spell ""diploma""
Dip to the hood and get rich
Slangin rocks to a smoked-out bitch
No school'll come close to that
A few transaction make my pockets fat
I make a lot of money and it ain't no lie
I'll probably ball 'til the day I die
And if I didn't, so what?
I bet you I'd still come up
Cause there's a whole lot of money in the ghetto.. yeah you know

This song's dedicated
To my homies in that gangsta lean
Why'd you have to go so soon?
It seems like yesterday
We were hangin 'round the hood
Now I'm gonna
Keep your memory alive
Like a homie should

A lifetime of memories
Going down the drain
I'd like to keep steppin'
But I can't get past the pain

I tip my 40 to your memory
Take a drink, and I
Stop to think, and I
I know one day soon
We'll be- We'll be hangin' out

[Chorus]
This is for my homies
This is for my homies, well well
See you when I get there
In that gangsta lean, in that gangsta lean
This is for my homies
This is for my homies, well well
See you when I get there
In that gangsta lean, in that gangsta lean

[Verse 2]
My God, my God
Could you pass on a message for me?
Tell him put down those dice for a second, Lord
Listen to his homie
Could you tell him
I'll never let go of his memory?
So his son will know
He don't have to cry no more
Cause God's got his back, I said God's got his back

A lifetime of memories
Going down the drain
I'd like to keep steppin'
But I can't get past the pain

I tip my 40 to your memory
Take a drink, and I
Stop to think, and I
I know one day soon
We'll be, we'll be hangin out

[Chorus]
This is for my homies
This is for my homies
See you when I get there
In that gangsta lean, in that gangsta lean
This is for my homies
This is for my homies
You know I miss you, you know I miss you, my homie
See you when I get there
In that gangsta lean, in that gangsta lean

[Interlude]
This song is decicated to homies in that gangsta lean
Tommy from Master's Touch
My boy Y-B
And my boy Eibere
And whoever else out there
Thats gotta homie thats in a gangsta lean
And also my boys in the pen
That ain't ever gonna see the street again
Cause you know what?
It dont matter what they was doing while they was here
They couldve been bangin', slangin'
But they ain't here no more
And thats somebody's daddy
Somebody's baby, that's somebody's homie
So go on and let 'em rest while they in that gangsta lean
You know what I'm sayin'?
That's on the real, loc

[Chorus/Outro]
This is for my homies
I can't believe that your gone
See you when I get there
I'll see you, I'll see you, I'll see you
Illlll see you
This is for my homies
Now that your in that gangsta lean, well well well
See you when I get there
I'm so sorry you're gone but I've got to keep on
(This is for my homies)
I gotta keep movin', I gotta keep movin
I gotta keep movin', movin', movin', movin'
(See you when I get there)
I'll see you, I'll see you
One day, someday, homie, someday

""Never ever think of jerkin me""	--] Greg Nice

[ Jordan Knight ]
You should have treated me right
But you left me lonely and cold at night
Since you won't, someone will
Treat me better and be for real

[ NKOTB ]
If you didn't want it, you shoulda let me know
But since you didn't want it, then girl, you got to go
You left me sad and lonely, and ran away from home
So since I'm not your only, then go and fetch your bone

[ Jordan Knight (+ NKOTB) ]
Cause you'se a (dawg)
Dirty dawg (dawg) dirty dawg (dawg)
Ooh, you're a dirty, dirty (dawg)
Dirty dawg (dawg) dirty dawg (dawg)
Ooh, you're so dirty, dirty

""Never ever think of jerkin me""

[ Jordan Knight ]
I gave you all that I can
Till I caught you swingin with another man
But this time you strayed too far
Now you come beggin like the dog you are

[ NKOTB ]
If you didn't want it, you shoulda let me know
But since you didn't want it, then girl, you got to go
Don't think that you can play me, and jerk me all around
You used to be my lady, now your ass is in the pound

Yo (Yo) Why you wanna act like a tramp (tramp)
A wet food stamp?
I think it's time for me to break camp
Had a crush on my man the first time we met
Now what you see is what you get
I lost more than a mill on a gambling bet
So here's the chuckwagon for the dog in you
Here's the KennelRation and the Alpo, too
[ Smooth B ]
Now you know I didn't want her
She tried to back me in a corner
Told her blow the horn like little Jack Horner
Forever forbidden
The fast girls in life, the fast cars, they call 'em kittens
Now they've been known to amaze
But they can't pull one over on me, I got game for days
Save the sap rap for the handicapped
Been around the block and I didn't fall for the dirty trap

They said I was dying versus DNA
My first response; y'all are very deceived
But I get it, I checked the polls and kept my chin up cause I ain't scared to be me
But all that ""grab the nose"" the ""two fives to your chest"" is a style I can barely believe
Even the heart is not beating me with that
So try if you want, I'm daring you P
But off the rip, let me address the fans that are still staring at me
Prolly thinking to yourself, ""Son that's wack""
Well, see, P, our styles are a little different
And they gon' look a lot more live when I (RUN THAT BACK!)
They said I was DYING
FIRST RESPONSE, y'all are very deceived
I CHECKED THE PULSE, KEPT MY CHIN UP, ain't scared to be me
They GRAB THE NOSE, TWO FIVES TO THE CHEST...
By now, y'all are aware of the scheme
When the HEART is NOT BEATING-
Look, I'm a BREATH OF FRESH AIR in this league!
Let's rap, Party!
I can care less when this cat started
You fighting against a star, you not even the nicest in your squad
Take me to your leader like Matt Hardy
Don't slack on me
They should've gave me the cash you got for conducting myself the way grownups do
'Ganik, you could've slid me P's stash he owes from the last event, and some of those bucks too
'Cause your King Of The Dot career against the wall, Nut
Aww, but you at home bruh? Cool
Well, be prepared 'cause every time they book me, I black out
I'm known for doing things you don't show up to!
Y'all chill, hold the clapping
Y'all got me battling the syllable king known for spazzing
Homie acting like he toting gattlings
A TEC shoot, well I'm Lex Luger the Total Package
And I'm in L.A., shooting my shot with Kobe passion
My job commissioning a holy fashion
You just my side work, like rolling napkins
So when I say {speaks Russian} forget multi rapping
I'm talking to Oxxxymiron fans while I stomp you in the ground: that's multitasking
I know at face value, I may not appear ghetto
But growing up, I seen the hand whipping in the kitchen before Daredevil
No money, a lot of times, we literally had to pray for the food
For peace, I would've traded it all
That's why I chose a different path like vocational schools
But you best believe, I seek freedom in God
But the punchline is ambitious, it's known to reach for the stars
You and Pass both from Cali, well y'all can catch C's from the bars
Two-piece and I dodge, I lay 'em both out
Awww, now they two P's in a pod!
Look!
Anybody that had me losing is clueless and illogical
I refuse to let Rufus from Kim Possible think he's doing the improbable
Go ahead, spit your outta context Bible multis, pretend that you way too better
Welcome back, hopefully beating me makes you better

[Round 1: Pnut]
What's poppin', G?
They say you a good rapper but not to me, get chopped in three
From head to toe, that's noggin'/knee
For knockin' me? Katana swing
That motion? Sickness; Dramamine
Drama: mean
If I go snap, eyes roll back, drama queen, common theme
Watch me cook; Paula Deen
Palm the thing, Llama beef, he'll get the picture like texts, it's called a meme
Trauma scene, that's exactly what I planned for you
That blood stain, amber hue
We after you the whole game, code name: Camera Crew
Five people add ten pounds like camera's do
Clap at  you, bring your bitch we bamboo that's Panda food
Ayo, Ness! You're the blackest dude
If there was a biopic for your fans to view
The director would use a black tarp as the cast for you
But back to you
I run up on him like- (That's racist!)
It is racist
I run up on him like, ""What's poppin' Ward? I want a war.""
Fuck an arm and a leg! It'll cost him more
Pop a four, and drain his noodle: that's a pasta pour
But you? I'm walkin' toward
With a bat, man, I X men: comic store
I crop his core, the plan is simple, 30 and over like I'm mature
It pay to take me out like I'm a chore
I for sure dropping his eye like his sight is sore
Cause I came to kill Asian steel, iron ore
I got a blade scratching on A's side like vinyl stores
Spinal cords get tore if he one on one
It's cumbersome, clip around the waist like a cumberbund
You'll go from rocking a Jesus tee to being hung on one!
Come on son, I'm built for this
Fuck three rounds: let's go O.T., A
I don't play in this game: that's a OTA
Large chest, Marquette like the old D. Wade
Do son harm, one arm: I'm OBJ!
So behave, or I met at Opie's way to kill the kid on my terms: that's Roe v. Wade
Listen, if you really got heart, show me, A
Make me a believer, cause we need a breather
To kill you or kill you, I'm eager with either
I ether a preacher who's weaker and weaker
They keep you around cause it's cheaper to keep her
If I reach for a cleaver we speaking in beeper
Cause I hit him on the hip and go deeper and deeper
Til he bleeds from his femur
I let it sink in his Caesar
I'm goin' hard on A. Ward
Bitch, leave it to Beaver!

[Round 2; A. Ward]
Rebuttal game crazy
I did that cause Avocado loves it when I say that
Rebuttal game crazy
And y'all can tell I'm not the kind of dude that be sparking with the steel
One arm like OBJ- you can do like him and get carted off the field!
I'm that nice
Every match I leave it all out in the field
That's why none of these vets get up here and start playing with me
And I didn't bring a million Pnut flips, I kept it to maybe fifty
Cause if Nut goes nuts, man I'm a different type of Saynt
To me the name flips are too redundant, not an option
Rock 'Em, Sock 'Em
Here's a heads-up: you lose in the ring 'cause I move with punches
Don't toy with me, P
They said you nice
I don't buy into the animal that you are
And the twist is I can drop the building outta nowhere: I'm not in Kansas anymore!
But as far as the route to that chain, since the last time we was in Canada with-
Man, this real-life Chiefs vs. Raiders
I got the drive to be on a Hunt out west
And he broke down looking at the Manual for the Carr
I'm that nice!
You are a slave to a style that is not appealing
And every battle rapper in here knows that we can do it just as well
We just understand that it's got a ceiling
So P get to stepping before you receive a remedial lesson
Three weekends of prepping and I still came eager to stretch him
This a eulogy and usually those are suppose to be for reflection
But I figure with me as the reverend
I took initiative and kinda tweaked the direction
I don't need to reach for the piece when speech is the weapon
I'mma put him in a box like he been confessing all of his heathen obsessions
Before the time he get to pick a Hail Mary like a deep interception
Your style? I can only stomach it for awhile like brief indigestion
Fox hound? We gon' talk 'bout what you throw up like a bulimia session
Please, I'm begging you please get to speaking aggressive
Cause you don' picked the wrong one like the recent election
If he get to flexing, I'm with all that
Dunsh in TalkBack, I'm here to leave an impression
Your cheek is affected, your peeps get the message
Your body they rushin' to: that's a senior elective
They make it before the twelves: season eleven
They find P on the spine: the encyclopedia section
Not conscious, people who agree with oppression
And under cupboards like a secret detective, mother-
Whoa
I need to breathe for a second
Oh my, that was almost a Dizaster like Gjonaj but Jesus be the protection
You are basic!
I know you heard it before, I'm not the only messenger
But Cali, your man kind of weak and y'all show the dude love like the Foley wrestler
Fresh Coast? I came here looking for smoke on a higher level
And feel like y'all sold me regular
While I slide on him, no laces, upfront, co-pay ya
Stick and move, Joe Fraiser
Drop P; probation
How's it a rookie move when I let Aaron judge the right before the left swing like Cody Bellinger!?
I'm that nice!
Like I said, three weeks' notice
I ain't mean to hurry the writtens y'all
But y'all still getting nine minutes of Jimz/gems like a Dirrty Prediction blog
Round two

[Round 2: Pnut]
Aye for King Of The Dot, I hate they way they force your face
It's like they overlook the poorest traits and compare porridge with a porter steak
But I get it, he's hungry and dinner is what they orchestrate
But we don't correlate
'Cause I'm fire and got ice...so only me and Cor' relate!
We different
On a scale of ten, I'm over eight
You? Settle for three like fourth and eight
You overate but still get fed even if you over eight
But not us, cause we asked for a meal and wonder where they store the plates
See your rise had a shorter wait
They ain't wanna form you late so formulate
If Ward's on Watch, storm the gates
It's 7:59, we form at 8:00
In two circles like a form of 8
And give him everything that Foreman ate
Fuck Ward, he can't beat me here or in space
I got a corpse in place
So get the worst of this exchange: that's a foreign rate
But it's your mistake
I wig on son, I'm Norman Bates!
Til they force the breaks and leave bud at the bottom like you're the shake
Go ahead, support your faith
Cause honestly, I don't care who you pray to A
If you own the Bible or read a page a day
But pray today cause you've folded to get fly: paper plane
It's battle rap stupid, if you wanna increase the word this ain't he way
So stay away cause you sold out to get here, you pay to play in a major way
You walking the same path Satan paved
'Cause you don't give honor to God
You bootleg the Colts like when Peyton played!
We ain't the same!
Cause me? I'll hop in the ring and fight y'all vets
A nice raw left will leave A. Ward tore: A Tribe Called Quest
You say I wouldn't show? I defy those bets
Do what I do best, and put you outta place, that's a typo text
They say I owe Ness
Compassion, but show less
The world against me despite those threats
At war with the Galaxy: I'm an iOS
I don't stress cause this is where you night go left
Blue caps, Geico texts
I'll run in his church and gravesite it
Shoot the pastor if he don't stay quiet then Daylyt it
I draw on his face, if they riot, they all get a shell, the same diet
Then I finish with Sister Abigail: I'm Bray Wyatt
Wrestling bars never get OLD!
Aye, be happy it's only three rounds cause I was down for writing more
You preach religion, but you FEMA victim
You get washed with a ninth Ward

[Round 3: A. Ward]
All them forced multis and you react, it's like y'all can throw a parade for the geek
""I'll run in ya church""- let me know when you do cause I'll save you a seat
Third round's supposed to be the closer, right?
Well I'ma put my heart in it and have a ball like the new Lakers
See I ain't gonna lot on my mind, I got a few acres, move hater
You don't know what you getting into with this box, I'll loot crate ya
Paul and Silas, I put prayer behind the bars, expect room shakers
Y'all ain't catch that because that's in Act:16
But how are you 37 and act 16?
You collect Pops, apparently Nickelodean shirts and new Vans
I collected trading cards, my mom collected food stamps
We didn't have the newest shoes, never had the cool brands
Fridge full of Juicy Juice, pantry full of soup cans
So keep it hip hop, don't even do as much as shoulder rub me
All he's been doing the whole battle
Spit a million multi's with no substance exposing nothing
Not to mention you got the cult following; Tony Dungy
And y'all let the watered down diva stand on the bars? Coyote Ugly
Well how can he
Think he got more performance or style than me, it's all fallacy
I switch it up for the crowd to see
A different pay grade, we're talking hourly, the salary
Bar after bar you took shots, getting wild G
But just cause you handled a Bender don't mean you can't be hungover...a balcony!
They like, ""Whoa! Why all the aggression Ward?""
Cause you look like the kid in high school that beat my Tetris score
But if it's a bond issue, we can settle it up
I'll put a bounty on your head like President Trump
In a city, my lines lead the numbers like measuring cups
But I'm even better in the hood like Mello and Lux, you disagree?
I'm too comfortable up here y'all. I am too comfortable
You disagree? Unfollow me
You went dormant, I took advantage of your lead son, honestly
I bring up grand bars and hunger so the lead gon' rock wit me
While you watch this new wave pass you before your eyes like beach front property
Bro, you actually think a title shot is something this league will extend you?
Of course not, battle wise you've already reached your potential
Your ceiling is here
I'm not gonna front and act like bar wise a lot of it's trash
You will always be that flight and hotel room or a couple hundred dollars for gas
You lack IT bro
The truth hurts, I could care less if y'all find this foul
You went from battler of the year to here, your hype went down
As far as number one contender, you and 'Ganik had a nice sit down
And you realized a lot of other people involved, well, well, well...who's the side chick now?!
It's YTG, so you know I gotta speak the facts
They want me to point out all the rebounds that blocked you in your recent past
Assist and exposing party fouls, like, ""Who's drink is that?""
I only got a couple minutes before my turn over and I ain't keeping stats
It's A. Ward, I don't care if you faith in battle rap is a bad look
Every event, every city, every venue, I never get up here and act shook
That cat of nine tails, ripped flesh out my savior with glass hooks
Does He love you?
The answer was in his back like math books
Look, I ain't come here to get personal with you
Just know, I brought enough bars to body you and any person that's with-
Shout out to my dude Gully
Man, this man right here knows how to coach a killa
So at GvG 2, somebody give me Rone or Chilla
A. Ward let's go

[Round 3: Pnut]
""He collect Pops, I collect cards"", bro nobody cares
I'll punch your Upper Deck cause you'll never be Top' and you lacking the Flair
You talking 'bout side chicks? Let's talk about yo' girl
Cause she don't like you and she never has
She'll probably piss on your epitaph
Last night I was with your better half she blew/blue Party she Democrat
Fuck you man
See I can rebuttal too

[A. Ward]
No that was written

[Pnut]
Huh?

[A. Ward]
That was written

[Pnut]
No it wasn't
See when it comes to this, you far from better
Get scarred forever and get stomped out with more feet than a yard can measure
The plan is simple, put arms together
Target centers, leave A on his chest, scarlet letters
See we fighting dawg, but ain't a fight in dawg, his bark is better
Cause he promo this and promo that
Followed by a Jesus piece, 'til I'm around his neck like a Jesus piece
I'll never say he's a beast cause he acts religiously
Ass? Delivery
That's a fetus breach and we see through the cover like Yeezus, sheesh
I'm cut throat, I need a sheet so he's deceased
My band's at his house, Pete and Pete and we can eat
So I pepper his grill, shit you can't tell if he's mesquite or he's Mystique

[A. Ward]
I think she just followed me

[Pnut]
Not that the X-Man dummy
That's blue in the face, I'm miles ahead lose you, Drew and the Saints
Put two in his bank than get a royal flush
That's an all black suit using an Ace, I'm losing my faith
In battle rap, cause when it comes to the chain
They say I'm no longer in line for squandering time
Though I conquer and climb any offer assigned
I hop in the ring, rocking The Thing; it's clobbering time
Lager and lime, my bars made a buzz that's water to wine
Then Blackout happened and value went dollar to dime
But let's ponder the crime
Cause they say I no showed and that wasn't true
They named Pete the best battler, shit that wasn't you
Shit they ignored every vote from fans packed in the room
The minute that I had to cancel like, ""We have to review""
Actual news, your plaque needs an asterisk dude
They just found a better Pass scheme and passed it to you
But Travis is cool
He tried to expose me at my expense but I can afford that
Figured if I played by the rules I'd get my award back
And I got me A. Ward back, it's Rorschach
Cause no matter what, we gon' see things differently
And now when they see me in the ring
You change how they view it like green screen imaging
But controversy sells, so I guess I gotta run with that
And it's fucking wack, stupid as a ""run it back""
You take several things of the same category and scheme on it
Like, ""Hey bro, they're words."" They're all relative great
But to get to the point is a hell of a wait
Corinthian, Core in thee end, I'm telling him straight
You just highlight the reach like a tale of the tape
See I ain't trying to get personal with you but this is a personal issue
I kill you and any person that's with you
I got a Mac in the bag like any purse in the venue
I'm a hitman for hire, if I tell you my rates, the perks will offend you
Put this perp' on the menu and see how fast your church will avenge you
So go ahead, keep doing your heavenly schemes and I will never feel son
Cause you're nothing but the fake Chilla and I would fucking kill the real one
But shout out to the real fans
I don't care if you can rap really good or hardly rap
And the next time tell God, tell him ""Party's back!""",King of the Dot,1994,"[83, 76, 67, 60, 51, 35, 34, 33, 31]",9
366,"Family Affair (From ""Addams Family Values"")","War and jingoism might postpone, but could not fully suppress, the class anger that came from the realities of ordinary life. As the twentieth century opened, that anger reemerged. Emma Goldman, the anarchist and feminist, whose political consciousness was shaped by factory work, the Haymarket executions, the Homestead strike, the long prison term of her lover and comrade, Alexander Berkman, the depression of the 1890s, the strike struggles of New York, her own imprisonment on Blackwell's Island, spoke at a meeting some years after the Spanish-American war:

How our hearts burned with indignation against the atrocious Spaniards! .. . But when the smoke was over, the dead buried, and the cost of the war came back to the people in an increase in the price of commodities and rent-that is, when we sobered up from our patriotic spree-it suddenly dawned on us that the cause of the Spanish-American war was the price of sugar. . .. that the lives, blood, and money of the American people were used to protect the interests of the American capitalists.

Mark Twain was neither an anarchist nor a radical. By 1900, at sixty-live, he was a world- acclaimed writer of funny-serious-American-to-the-bone stories. He watched the United States and other Western countries go about the world and wrote in the New York Herald as the century began: ""I bring you the stately matron named Christendom, returning bedraggled, besmirched, and dishonored from pirate raids in Kiao-Chou, Manchuria, South Africa, and the Philippines, with her soul full of meanness, her pocket full of boodle, and her mouth full of pious hypocrisies.""

There were writers of the early twentieth century who spoke for socialism or criticized the capitalist system harshly-not obscure pamphleteers, but among the most famous of American literary figures, whose books were read by millions: Upton Sinclair, Jack London, Theodore Dreiser, Frank Norris.

Upton Sinclair's novel The Jungle, published in 1906, brought the conditions in the meatpacking plants of Chicago to the shocked attention of the whole country, and stimulated demand for laws regulating the meat industry. But also, through the story of an immigrant laborer, Jurgis Rudkus, it spoke of socialism, of how beautiful life might be if people cooperatively owned and worked and shared the riches of the earth. The Jungle was first published in the Socialist newspaper Appeal to Reason; it was then read by millions as a hook, and was translated into seventeen languages.

One of the influences on Upton Sinclair's thinking was a book, People of the Abyss, by Jack London. London was a member of the Socialist party. He had come out of the slums of San Francisco, the child of an unwed mother. He had been a newsboy, a cannery worker, a sailor, a fisherman, had worked in a jute mill and a laundry, hoboed the railroads to the East Coast, been clubbed by a policeman on the streets of New York and arrested for vagrancy in Niagara Falls, watched men beaten and tortured in jail, pirated oysters in San Francisco Bay, read Flaubert, Tolstoy, Melville, and the Communist Manifesto, preached socialism in the Alaskan gold camps in the winter of 1896, sailed 2,000 miles back through the Bering Sea, and became a world-famous writer of adventure books. In 1906, he wrote his novel The Iron Heel, with its warning of a fascist America, its ideal of a socialist brotherhood of man. In the course of it, through his characters, he indicts the system.

In the face of the facts that modern man lives more wretchedly than the cave-man, and that his producing power is a thousand times greater than that of the cave-man, no other conclusion is possible than that the capitalist class has mismanaged .. . criminally and selfishly mismanaged.

And with this attack, the vision:

Let us not destroy those wonderful machines that produce efficiently and cheaply. Let us control them. Let us profit by their efficiency and cheapness. Let us run them for ourselves. That, gentlemen, is socialism... .

It was a time when even a self-exiled literary figure living in Europe and not prone to political statements-the novelist Henry James-could tour the United States in 1904 and see the country as a ""huge Rappacini garden, rank with each variety of the poison-plant of the money passion.""

""Muckrakers,"" who raked up the mud and the muck, contributed to the atmosphere of dissent by simply telling what they saw. Some of the new mass-circulation magazines, ironically enough in the interest of profit, printed their articles: Ida Tarbell's exposure of the Standard Oil Company; Lincoln Steffens's stories of corruption in the major American cities.

By 1900, neither the patriotism of the war nor the absorption of energy in elections could disguise the troubles of the system. The process of business concentration had gone forward; the control by bankers had become more clear. As technology developed and corporations became larger, they needed more capital, and it was the bankers who had this capital. By 1904, more than a thousand railroad lines had been consolidated into six great combinations, each allied with either Morgan or Rockefeller interests. As Cochran and Miller say:

The imperial leader of the new oligarchy was the House of Morgan. In its operations it was ably assisted by the First National Bank of New York (directed by George F. Baker) and the National City Bank of New York (presided over by James Stillman, agent of the Rockefeller interests). Among them, these three men and their financial associates occupied 341 directorships in 112 great corporations. The total resources of these corporations in 1912 was $22,245,000,000, more than the assessed value of all property in the twenty-two states and territories west of the Mississippi River.. ..

Morgan had always wanted regularity, stability, predictability. An associate of his said in 1901:

With a man like Mr. Morgan at the head of a great industry, as against the old plan of many diverse interests in it, production would become more regular, labor would be more steadily employed at better wages, and panics caused by over-production would become a thing of the past.

But even Morgan and his associates were not in complete control of such a system. In 1907, there was a panic, financial collapse, and crisis. True, the very big businesses were not hurt, but profits after 1907 were not as high as capitalists wanted, industry was not expanding as fast as it might, and industrialists began to look for ways to cut costs.

One way was Taylorism. Frederick W. Taylor had been a steel company foreman who closely analyzed every job in the mill, and worked out a system of finely detailed division of labor, increased mechanization, and piecework wage systems, to increase production and profits. In 1911, he published a book on ""scientific management"" that became powerfully influential in the business world. Now management could control every detail of the worker's energy and time in the factory. As Harry Braverman said (Labor and Monopoly Capital), the purpose of Taylorism was to make workers interchangeable, able to do the simple tasks that the new division of labor required-like standard parts divested of individuality and humanity, bought and sold as commodities.

It was a system well fitted for the new auto industry. In 1909, Ford sold 10,607 autos; in 1913, 168,000; in 1914, 248,000 (45 percent of all autos produced). The profit: $30 million.

With immigrants a larger proportion of the labor force (in the Carnegie plants of Allegheny County in 1907, of the 14,359 common laborers, 11,694 were Eastern Europeans), Taylorism, with its simplified unskilled jobs, became more feasible.

In New York City, the new immigrants went to work in the sweatshops. The poet Edwin Markham wrote in Cosmopolitan magazine, January 1907:

In unaired rooms, mothers and fathers sew by day and by night. Those in the home sweatshop must work cheaper than those in the factory sweatshops. ... And the children are called in from play to drive and drudge beside their elders..

All the year in New York and in other cities you may watch children radiating to and from such pitiful homes. Nearly any hour on the East Side of New York City you can see them-pallid boy or spindling girl-their faces dulled, their backs bent under a heavy load of garments piled on head and shoulders, the muscles of the whole frame in a long strain... .

Is it not a cruel civilization that allows little hearts and little shoulders to strain under these grown- up responsibilities, while in the same city, a pet cur is jeweled and pampered and aired on a fine lady's velvet lap on the beautiful boulevards?

The city became a battlefield. On August 10, 1905, the New York Tribune reported that a strike at Federman's bakery on the Lower East Side led to violence when Federman used scab labor to continue producing:

Strikers or their sympathizers wrecked the bake shop of Philip Federman at No. 183 Orchard Street early last night amid scenes of the most tumultuous excitement. Policemen smashed heads right and left with their nightsticks after two of their number had been roughly dealt with by the mob. .. .

There were five hundred garment factories in New York. A woman later recalled the conditions of work:

. .. dangerously broken stairways . .. windows few and so dirty.. .. The wooden floors that were swept once a year. . .. Hardly any other light but the gas jets burning by day and by night. . . the filthy, malodorous lavatory in the dark hall. No fresh drinking water.. . . mice and roaches. . . .

During the winter months . . . how we suffered from the cold. In the summer we suffered from the heat. . ..

In these disease-breeding holes we, the youngsters together with the men and women toiled from seventy and eighty hours a week! Saturdays and Sundays included!... A sign would go up on Saturday afternoon: ""If you don't come in on Sunday, you need not come in on Monday."" ... Children's dreams of a day off shattered. We wept, for after all, we were only children. ...

At the Triangle Shirtwaist Company, in the winter of 1909, women organized and decided to strike. Soon they were walking the picket line in the cold, knowing they could not win while the other factories were operating. A mass meeting was called of workers in the other shops, and Clara Lemlich, in her teens, an eloquent speaker, still bearing the signs of her recent beating on the picket line, stood up: ""I offer a resolution that a general strike be declared now!"" The meeting went wild; they voted to strike.

Pauline Newman, one of the strikers, recalled years later the beginning of the general strike:

Thousands upon thousands left the factories from every side, all of them walking down toward Union Square. It was November, the cold winter was just around the corner, we had no fur coats to keep warm, and yet there was the spirit that led us on and on until we got to some hall. . . .

I can see the young people, mostly women, walking down and not caring what might happen . .. the hunger, cold, loneliness.. .. They just didn't care on that particular day; that was their day.

The union had hoped three thousand would join the strike. Twenty thousand walked out. Every day a thousand new members joined the union, the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, which before this had few women. Colored women were active in the strike, which went on through the winter, against police, against scabs, against arrests and prison. In more than three hundred shops, workers won their demands. Women now became officials in the union. Pauline Newman again:

We tried to educate ourselves. I would invite the girls to my rooms, and we took turns reading poetry in English to improve our understanding of the language. One of our favorites was Thomas Hood's ""Song of the Shirt,"" and another . . . Percy Bysshe Shelley's ""Mask of Anarchy."" ...

""Rise like lions after slumber

In unvanquishable number!

Shake your chains to earth, like dew.

Which in sleep had fallen on you-

Ye are many, they are few!""

The conditions in the factories did not change much. On the afternoon of March 25, 1911, a fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Company that began in a rag bin swept through the eighth, ninth, and tenth floors, too high for fire ladders to reach. The fire chief of New York had said that his ladders could reach only to the seventh floor. But half of New York's 500,000 workers spent all day, perhaps twelve hours, above the seventh floor. The laws said factory doors had to open outward. But at the Triangle Company the doors opened in. The law said the doors could not be locked during working hours, but at the Triangle Company doors were usually locked so the company could keep track of the employees. And so, trapped, the young women were burned to death at their work-tables, or jammed against the locked exit door, or leaped to their deaths down the elevator shafts. The New York World reported:

.. . screaming men and women and boys and girls crowded out on the many window ledges and threw themselves into the streets far below. They jumped with their clothing ablaze. The hair of some of the girls streamed up aflame as they leaped. Thud after thud sounded on the pavements. It is a ghastly fact that on both the Greene Street and Washington Place sides of the building there grew mounds of the dead and dying. .. .

From opposite windows spectators saw again and again pitiable companionships formed in the instant of death-girls who placed their arms around each other as they leaped.

When it was over, 146 Triangle workers, mostly women, were burned or crushed to death. There was a memorial parade down Broadway, and 100,000 marched.

There were more fires. And accidents. And sickness. In the year 1904, 27,000 workers were killed on the job, in manufacturing, transport, and agriculture. In one year, 50,000 accidents took place in New York factories alone. Hat and cap makers were getting respiratory diseases, quarrymen were inhaling deadly chemicals, lithographic printers were getting arsenic poisoning. A New York State Factory Investigation Commission reported in 1912:

Sadie is an intelligent, neat, clean girl, who has worked from the time she got her working papers in embroidery factories.... In her work she was accustomed to use a white powder (chalk or talcum was usual) which was brushed over the perforated designs and thus transferred to the cloth. The design was easily brushed off when made of chalk or of talcum. ... Her last employer therefore commenced using white lead powder, mixed with rosin, which cheapened the work as the powder could not be rubbed off and necessitate restamping.

None of the girls knew of the change in powder, nor of the danger in its use.. . .

Sadie had been a very strong, healthy girl, good appetite and color; she began to be unable to eat. . .. Her hands and feet swelled, she lost the use of one hand, her teeth and gums were blue. When she finally had to stop work, after being treated for months for stomach trouble, her physician advised her to go to a hospital. There the examination revealed the fact that she had lead poisoning.. ..

According to a report of the Commission on Industrial Relations, in 1914, 35,000 workers were killed in industrial accidents and 700,000 injured. That year the income of forty-four families making $1 million or more equaled the total income of 100,000 families earning $500 a year. The record shows an exchange between Commissioner Harris Weinstock of the Commission on Industrial Relations and President John Osgood, head of a Colorado coal company controlled by the Rockefellers:

WEINSTOCK: If a worker loses his life, are his dependents compensated in any way?
OSGOOD: Not necessarily. In some cases they are and in some cases not.
WEINSTOCK: If he is crippled for life is there any compensation?
OSGOOD: No sir, there is none....
WEINSTOCK: Then the whole burden is thrown directly upon their shoulders.
OSGOOD: Yes, sir.
WEINSTOCK: The industry hears none of it?
OSCOOD: No, the industry bears none of it.

Unionization was growing. Shortly after the turn of the century there were 2 million members of labor unions (one in fourteen workers), 80 percent of them in the American Federation of Labor. The AFL was an exclusive union-almost all male, almost all white, almost all skilled workers. Although the number of women workers kept growing-it doubled from 4 million in 1890 to 8 million in 1910, and women were one-fifth of the labor force-only one in a hundred belonged to a union.

Black workers in 1910 made one-third of the earnings of white workers. Although Samuel Gompers, head of the AFL, would make speeches about its belief in equal opportunity, the Negro was excluded from most AFL unions. Gompers kept saying he did not want to interfere with the ""internal affairs"" of the South; ""I regard the race problem as one with which you people of the Southland will have to deal; without the interference, too, of meddlers from the outside.""

In the reality of struggle, rank-and-file workers overcame these separations from time to time. Foner quotes Mary McDowell's account of the formation of a women's union in the Chicago stockyards:

It was a dramatic occasion on that evening, when an Irish girl at the door called out-""A Colored sister asks admission. What shall I do with her?"" And the answer came from the Irish young woman in the chair-""Admit her, of course, and let all of you give her a hearty welcome!""

In New Orleans in 1907 a general strike on the levees, involving ten thousand workers (longshoremen, teamsters, freight handlers), black and white, lasted twenty days. The head of the Negro longshoremen, E. S. Swan, said:

The whites and Negroes were never before so strongly cemented in a common bond and in my 39 years of experience of the levee, I never saw such solidarity. In all the previous strikes the Negro was used against the white man but that condition is now past and both races are standing together for their common interests... .

These were exceptions. In general, the Negro was kept out of the trade union movement. W. E. B. Du Bois wrote in 1915: ""The net result of all this has been to convince the American Negro that his greatest enemy is not the employer who robs him, but his fellow white working-man.""

Racism was practical for the AFL. The exclusion of women and foreigners was also practical. These were mostly unskilled workers, and the AFL, confined mostly to skilled workers, was based on the philosophy of ""business unionism"" (in fact, the chief official of each AFL union was called the ""business agent""), trying to match the monopoly of production by the employer with a monopoly of workers by the union. In this way it won better conditions for some workers, and left most workers out.

AFL officials drew large salaries, hobnobbed with employers, even moved in high society. A press dispatch from Atlantic City, New Jersey, the fashionable seaside resort, in the summer of 1910:

Engaged in a game of bathing suit baseball with President Sam Gompers, Secretary Frank Morrison and other leaders of the A.F. of T,. on the beach this morning, John Mitchell, former head of the mine workers' union, lost a $ 1000 diamond ring presented to him by his admirers after the settlement of the big Pennsylvania coal strike. Capt. George Berke, a veteran life guard, found the ring, whereupon Mitchell peeled a hundred dollar hill from a roll he carried in his pocket and handed it to the captain as a reward for his find.

The well-paid leaders of the AFL were protected from criticism by tightly controlled meetings and by ""goon"" squads-hired toughs originally used against strikebreakers but after a while used to intimidate and beat up opponents inside the union.

In this situation-terrible conditions of labor, exclusivity in union organization-working people wanting radical change, seeing the root of misery in the capitalist system, moved toward a new kind of labor union. One morning in June 1905, there met in a hall in Chicago a convention of two hundred socialists, anarchists, and radical trade unionists from all over the United States. They were forming the I. W. W.-the Industrial Workers of the World. Big Bill Haywood, a leader of the Western Federation of Miners, recalled in his autobiography that he picked up a piece of board that lay on the platform and used it for a gavel to open the convention:

Fellow workers.. . . This is the Continental Congress of the working-class. We are here to confederate the workers of this country into a working-class movement that shall have for its purpose the emancipation of the working class from the slave bondage of capitalism.. .. The aims and objects of this organization shall he to put the working-class in possession of the economic power, the means of life, in control of the machinery of production and distribution, without regard to the capitalist masters.

On the speakers' platform with Haywood were Eugene Debs, leader of the Socialist party, and Mother Mary Jones, a seventy-five-year-old white-haired woman who was an organizer for the United Mine Workers of America. The convention drew up a constitution, whose preamble said:

The working class and the employing class have nothing in common. There can be no peace so long as hunger and want are found among millions of working people and the few, who make up the employing class, have all the good things of life.

Between these two classes a struggle must go on until all the toilers come together on the political as well as on the industrial field, and take and hold that which they produce by their labor, through an economic organization of the working class without affiliation with any political party.. ..

One of the IWW pamphlets explained why it broke with the AFL idea of craft unions:

The directory of unions of Chicago shows in 1903 a total of 56 different unions in the packing houses, divided up still more in 14 different national trades unions of the American Federation of Labor.

What a horrible example of an army divided against itself in the face of a strong combination of employers.. . .

The IWW (or ""Wobblies,"" as they came to be called, for reasons not really clear) aimed at organizing all workers in any industry into ""One Big Union,"" undivided by sex, race, or skills. They argued against making contracts with the employer, because this had so often prevented workers from striking on their own, or in sympathy with other strikers, and thus turned union people into strikebreakers. Negotiations by leaders for contracts replaced continuous struggle by the rank and tile, the Wobblies believed.

They spoke of ""direct action"":

Direct action means industrial action directly by, for, and of the workers themselves, without the treacherous aid of labor misleaders or scheming politicians. A strike that is initiated, controlled, and settled by the workers directly affected is direct action. . .. Direct action is industrial democracy.

One IWW pamphlet said: ""Shall I tell you what direct action means? The worker on the job shall tell the boss when and where he shall work, how long and for what wages and under what conditions.""

The IWW people were militant, courageous. Despite a reputation given them by the press, they did not believe in initiating violence, but did fight back when attacked. In McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania, they led a strike of six thousand workers in 1909 against an affiliate of the U.S. Steel Company, defied the state troopers, and battled with them. They promised to take a trooper's life for every worker killed (in one gun battle four strikers and three troopers were killed), and managed to keep picketing the factories until the strike was won.

The IWW saw beyond strikes:

Strikes are mere incidents in the class war; they are tests of strength, periodical drills in the course of which the workers train themselves for concerted action. This training is most necessary to prepare the masses for the final ""catastrophe,"" the general strike which will complete the expropriation of the employers.

The idea of anarcho-syndicalism was developing strongly in Spain and Italy and France at this time-that the workers would take power, not by seizing the state machinery in an armed rebellion, but by bringing the economic system to a halt in a general strike, then taking it over to use for the good of all. IWW organizer Joseph Ettor said:

If the workers of the world want to win, all they have to do is recognize their own solidarity. They have nothing to do but fold their arms and the world will stop. The workers are more powerful with their hands in their pockets than all the property of the capitalists. . . .

It was an immensely powerful idea. In the ten exciting years after its birth, the IWW became a threat to the capitalist class, exactly when capitalist growth was enormous and profits huge. The IWW never had more than five to ten thousand enrolled members at any one time- people came and went, and perhaps a hundred thousand were members at one time or another. But their energy, their persistence, their inspiration to others, their ability to mobilize thousands at one place, one time, made them an influence on the country far beyond their numbers. They traveled everywhere (many were unemployed or migrant workers); they organized, wrote, spoke, sang, spread their message and their spirit.

They were attacked with all the weapons the system could put together: the newspapers, the courts, the police, the army, mob violence. Local authorities passed laws to stop them from speaking; the IWW defied these laws. In Missoula, Montana, a lumber and mining area, hundreds of Wobblies arrived by boxcar after some had been prevented from speaking. They were arrested one after another until they clogged the jails and the courts, and finally forced the town to repeal its antispeech ordinance.

In Spokane, Washington, in 1909, an ordinance was passed to stop street meetings, and an IWW organizer who insisted on speaking was arrested. Thousands of Wobblies marched into the center of town to speak. One by one they spoke and were arrested, until six hundred were in jail. Jail conditions were brutal, and several men died in their cells, but the IWW won the right to speak.

In Fresno, California, in 1911, there was another free speech fight. The San Francisco Call commented:

It is one of those strange situations which crop up suddenly and are hard to understand. Some thousands of men, whose business it is to work with their hands, tramping and stealing rides, suffering hardships and facing dangers-to get into jail. . . .

In jail they sang, they shouted, they made speeches through the bars to groups that gathered outside the prison. As Joyce Kornbluh reports in her remarkable collection of TWW documents, Rebel Voices:

They took turns lecturing about the class struggle and leading the singing of Wobbly songs. When they refused to stop, the jailor sent for fire department trucks and ordered the fire hoses turned full force on the prisoners. The men used their mattresses as shields, and quiet was only restored when the icy water reached knee-high in the cells.

When city officials heard that thousands more were planning to come into town, they lifted the ban on street speaking and released the prisoners in small groups.

That same year in Aberdeen, Washington, once again laws against free speech, arrests, prison, and, unexpectedly, victory. One of the men arrested, ""Stumpy"" Payne, a carpenter, farm hand, editor of an IWW newspaper, wrote about the experience:

Here they were, eighteen men in the vigor of life, most of whom came long distances through snow and hostile towns by beating their way, penniless and hungry, into a place where a jail sentence was the gentlest treatment that could be expected, and where many had already been driven into the swamps and beaten nearly to death. ... Yet here they were, laughing with boyish glee at tragic tellings that to them were jokes.. . .

But what was the motive behind the actions of these men? . . . Why were they here? Is the call of Brotherhood in the human race greater than any fear or discomfort, despite the efforts of the masters of life for six thousand years to root out that call of Brotherhood from our minds?

In San Diego, Jack White, a Wobbly arrested in a free-speech fight in 1912, sentenced to six months in the county jail on a bread and water diet, was asked if he had anything to say to the court. A stenographer recorded what he said:

The prosecuting attorney, in his plea to the jury, accused me of saying on a public platform at a public meeting, ""To hell with the courts, we know what justice is."" He told a great truth when he lied, for if he had searched the innermost recesses of my mind he could have found that thought, never expressed by me before, but which I express now, ""To hell with your courts, I know what justice is,"" for I have sat in your court room day after day and have seen members of my class pass before this, the so-called bar of justice. I have seen you, Judge Sloane, and others of your kind, send them to prison because they dared to infringe upon the sacred rights of property. You have become blind and deaf to the rights of man to pursue life and happiness, and you have crushed those rights so that the sacred right of property shall be preserved. Then you tell me to respect the law. I do not. I did violate the law, as I will violate every one of your laws and still come before you and say ""To hell with the courts."" ...

The prosecutor lied, but I will accept his lie as a truth and say again so that you, Judge Sloane, may not be mistaken as to my altitude, ""To hell with your courts, I know what justice is.""

There were also beatings, fairings and featherings, defeats. One IWW member, John Stone, tells of being released from the jail at San Diego at midnight with another IWW man and forced into an automobile:

We were taken out of the city, about twenty miles, where the machine stopped. ... a man in the rear struck me with a blackjack several times on the head and shoulders; the other man then struck me on the mouth with his fist. The men in the rear then sprang around and kicked me in the stomach. I then started to run away; and heard a bullet go past me. I stopped. ... In the morning I examined Joe Marko's condition and found that the back of his head had been split open.

In 1916, in Everett, Washington, a boatload of Wobblies was fired on by two hundred armed vigilantes gathered by the sheriff, and five Wobblies were shot to death, thirty-one wounded. Two of the vigilantes were killed, nineteen wounded. The following year-the year the United States entered World War I-vigilantes in Montana seized IWW organizer Frank Little, tortured him, and hanged him, leaving his body dangling from a railroad trestle.

Joe Hill, an IWW organizer, wrote dozens of songs-biting, funny, class-conscious, inspiring-that appeared in IWW publications and in its Little Red Song Book. He became a legend in his time and after. His song ""The Preacher and the Slave"" had a favorite IWW target, the church:

Long-haired preachers come out every night,
Try to tell you what's wrong and what's right;
But when asked how about something to eat
They will answer with voices so sweet:

You will eat, bye and bye,
In that glorious land above the sky;
Work and pray, live on hay,
You'll get pie in the sky when you die.

His song ""Rebel Girl"" was inspired by the strike of women at the textile mills in Lawrence, Massachusetts, and especially by the IWW leader of that strike, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn:

There are women of many descriptions
In this queer world, as everyone knows.
Same are living in beautiful mansions,
And are wearing the finest of clothes.
There are blue-blooded queens and princesses,
Who have charms made of diamonds and pearl,
But the only and Thoroughbred Lady
Is the Rebel Girl.

In November 1915, Joe Hill was accused of killing a grocer in Salt Lake City, Utah, in a robbery. There was no direct evidence presented to the court that he had committed the murder, but there were enough pieces of evidence to persuade a jury to find him guilty. The case became known throughout the world, and ten thousand letters went to the governor in protest, but with machine guns guarding the entrance to the prison, Joe Hill was executed by a firing squad. He had written Bill Haywood just before this: ""Don't waste any time in mourning. Organize.""

The IWW became involved in a set of dramatic events in Lawrence, Massachusetts, in the year 1912, where the American Woolen Company owned four mills. The work force were immigrant families- Portuguese, French-Canadian, English, Irish, Russian, Italian, Syrian, Lithuanian, German, Polish, Belgian-who lived in crowded, flammable wooden tenements. The average wage was $8.76 a week. A woman physician in Lawrence, Dr. Elizabeth Shapleigh, wrote:

A considerable number of the boys and girls the within the first two or three years after beginning work ... thirty-six out of every 100 of all the men and women who work in the mill the before or by the time they are twenty-five years of age.

It was in January, midwinter, when pay envelopes distributed to weavers at one of the mills-Polish women-showed that their wages, already too low to feed their families, had been reduced. They stopped their looms and walked out of the mill. The next day, five thousand workers at another mill quit work, marched to still another mill, rushed the gates, shut off the power to the looms, and called on the other workers to leave. Soon ten thousand workers were on strike.

A telegram went to Joseph Ettor, a twenty-six-year-old Italian, an IWW leader in New York, to come to Lawrence to help conduct the strike. He came. A committee of fifty was set up, representing every nationality among the workers, to make the important decisions. Less than a thousand millworkers belonged to the IWW, but the AFL had ignored the unskilled workers, and so they turned to the IWW'' leadership in the strike.

The IWW organized mass meetings and parades. The strikers had to supply food and fuel for 50,000 people (the entire population of Lawrence was 86,000); soup kitchens were set up, and money began arriving from all over the country-from trade unions, IWW locals, socialist groups, individuals.

The mayor called out the local militia; the governor ordered out the state police. A parade of strikers was attacked by police a few weeks after the strike began. This led to rioting all that day. In the evening, a striker, Anna LoPizzo, was shot and killed. Witnesses said a policeman did it, but the authorities arrested Joseph Ettor and another IWW organizer who had come to Lawrence, a poet named Arturo Giovanitti. Neither was at the scene of the shooting, but the charge was that ""Joseph Ettor and Arturo Giovanitti did incite, procure, and counsel or command the said person whose name is not known to commit the said murder.. ..""

With Ettor, head of the strike committee, in jail, Big Bill Haywood was called in to replace him; other IWW organizers, including Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, came into Lawrence. Now there were twenty-two companies of militia and two troops of cavalry in the city. Martial law was declared, and citizens were forbidden to talk on the street. Thirty-six strikers were arrested, many sentenced to a year in prison. On Tuesday, January 30, a young Syrian striker, John Ramy, was bayoneted to death. But the strikers were still out, and the mills were not working. Ettor said: ""Bayonets cannot weave cloth.""

In February, the strikers began mass picketing, seven thousand to ten thousand pickets in an endless chain, marching through the mill districts, with white armbands: ""Don't be a scab."" But their food was running out and the children were hungry. It was proposed by the New York Call, a Socialist newspaper, that the children of strikers be sent to sympathetic families in other cities to take care of them while the strike lasted. This had been done by strikers in Europe, never in the United States- but in three days, the Call got four hundred letters offering to take children. The IWW and the Socialist party began to organize the children's exodus, taking applications from families who wanted them, arranging medical exams for the youngsters.

On February 10, over a hundred children, aged four to fourteen, left Lawrence for New York City. They were greeted at Grand Central Station by five thousand Italian Socialists singing the ""Marseillaise"" and the ""International."" The following week, another hundred children came to New York, and thirty-five to Barre, Vermont. It was becoming clear: if the children were taken care of, the strikers could stay out, for their spirit was high. The city officials in Lawrence, citing a statute on child neglect, said no more children would he permitted to leave Lawrence.

Despite the city edict, a group of forty children assembled on February 24 to go to Philadelphia. The railroad station was filled with police, and the scene that followed was described to Congressmen by a member of the Women's Committee of Philadelphia:

When the rime approached to depart, the children arranged in a long line, two by two, in orderly procession, with their parents near at hand, were about to make their way to the train when the police closed in on us with their clubs, beating right and left, with no thought of children, who were in the most desperate danger of being trampled to death. The mothers and children were thus hurled in a mass and bodily dragged to a military truck, and even then clubbed, irrespective of the cries of the panic-stricken women and children....

A week after that, women returning from a meeting were surrounded by police and clubbed; one pregnant woman was carried unconscious to a hospital and gave birth to a dead child.

Still, the strikers held out. ""They are always marching and singing,"" reporter Mary Heaton Vorse wrote. ""The tired, gray crowds ebbing and flowing perpetually into the mills had waked and opened their mouths to sing.""

The American Woolen Company decided to give in. It offered raises of 5 to 11 percent (the strikers insisted that the largest increases go to the lowest-paid), time and a quarter for overtime, and no discrimination against those who had struck. On March 14, 1912, ten thousand strikers gathered on the Lawrence Common and, with Bill Haywood presiding, voted to end the strike.

Ettor and Giovanitti went on trial. Support for them had been mounting all over the country. There were parades in New York and Boston; on September 30, fifteen thousand Lawrence workers struck for twenty-four hours to show their support for the two men. After that, two thousand of the most active strikers were fired, but the IWW threatened to call another strike, and they were put back. A jury found Ettor and Giovanitti not guilty, and that afternoon, ten thousand people assembled in Lawrence to celebrate.

The IWW took its slogan ""One Big Union"" seriously. Women, foreigners, black workers, the lowliest and most unskilled of workers, were included when a factory or mine was organized. When the Brotherhood of Timber Workers organized in Louisiana and invited Bill Haywood to speak to them in 1912 (shortly after the Lawrence victory), he expressed surprise that no Negroes were at the meeting. He was told it was against the law to have interracial meetings in Louisiana. Haywood told the convention:

You work in the same mills together. Sometimes a black man and a white man chop down the same tree together. 'You are meeting in convention now to discuss the conditions under which yon labor... . Why not be sensible about this and call the Negroes into the Convention? If it is against the law, this is one time when the law should be broken.

Negroes were invited into the convention, which then voted to affiliate with the TWW.

In 1900 there were 500,000 women office workers-in 1870 there had been 19,000. Women were switchboard operators, store workers, nurses. Half a million were teachers. The teachers formed a leachers League that fought against the automatic firing of women who became pregnant. The following ''Rules for Female Teachers"" were posted by the school board of one town in Massachusetts:

Do not get married.
Do not leave town at any time without permission of the school board.
Do not keep company with men.
Be home between the hours of 8 P.M. and 6 A.M.
Do not loiter downtown, in ice cream stores.
Do not smoke.
Do not get into a carriage with any man except your father or brother.
Do not dress in bright colors.
Do not dye your hair.
Do not wear any dress more than two inches above the ankle.

The conditions of women working in a Milwaukee brewery were described by Mother Mary Jones, who worked there briefly in 1910 (she was close to eighty at this time):

Condemned to slave daily in the wash-room in wet shoes and wet clothes, surrounded with foul- mouthed, brutal foremen ... the poor girls work in the vile smell of sour beer, lifting cases of empty and full bottles weighing from 100 to 150 pounds.. .. Rheumatism is one of the chronic ailments and is closely followed by consumption.. .. The foreman even regulates the time the girls may stay in the toilet room. ... Many of the girls have no home nor parents and are forced to feed and clothe and shelter themselves . . . on $3.00 a week. ...

In the laundries, women organized. In 1909, the Handbook of the Women's Trade Union Industrial League wrote about women in steam laundries:

How would you like to iron a shirt a minute? Think of standing at a mangle just above the washroom with the hot steam pouring up through the floor for 10, 12, 14 and sometimes 17 hours a day! Sometimes the floors are made of cement and then it seems as though one were standing' on hot coals, and the workers are dripping with perspiration.... They are . . . breathing air laden with particles of soda, ammonia, and other chemicals! The Laundry Workers Union ... in one city reduced this long day to 9 hours, and has increased the wages 50 percent.. . .

Labor struggles could make things better, but the country's resources remained in the hands of powerful corporations whose motive was profit, whose power commanded the government of the United States. There was an idea in the air, becoming clearer and stronger, an idea not just in the theories of Karl Marx but in the dreams of writers and artists through the ages: that people might cooperatively use the treasures of the earth to make life better for everyone, not just a few.

Around the turn of the century, strike struggles were multiplying-in the 1890s there had been about a thousand strikes a year; by 1904 there were four thousand strikes a year. Law and military force again and again took the side of the rich. It was a time when hundreds of thousands of Americans began to think of socialism.

Debs wrote in 1904, three years after the formation of the Socialist party:

The ""pure and simple"" trades union of the past does not answer the requirements of today. . . .

The attempt of each trade to maintain its own independence separately and apart from others results in increasing jurisdictional entanglements, fruitful of dissension, strife and ultimate disruption.. . .

The members of a trades union should be taught ... that the labor movement means more, infinitely more, than a paltry increase in wages and the strike necessary to secure it; that while it engages to do all that possibly can he done to better the working conditions of its members, its higher object is to overthrow the capitalist system of private ownership of the tools of labor, abolish wage-slavery and achieve the freedom of the whole working class and, in fact, of all mankind.. ..

What Debs accomplished was not in theory, or analysis, but in expressing eloquently, passionately, what people were feeling. The writer Heywood Broun once quoted a fellow Socialist speaking of Debs: ""That old man with the burning eyes actually believes that there can be such a thing as the brotherhood of man. And that's not the funniest part of it. As long as he's around I believe it myself.""

Eugene Debs had become a Socialist while in jail in the Pullman strike. Now he was the spokesman of a party that made him its presidential candidate five times. The party at one time had 100,000 members, and 1,200 office holders in 340 municipalities. Its main newspaper, Appeal to Reason, for which Debs wrote, had half a million subscribers, and there were many other Socialist newspapers around the country, so that, all together, perhaps a million people read the Socialist press.

Socialism moved out of the small circles of city immigrants-Jewish and German socialists speaking their own languages-and became American. The strongest Socialist state organization was in Oklahoma, which in 1914 had twelve thousand dues-paying members (more than New York State), and elected over a hundred Socialists to local office, including six to the Oklahoma state legislature. There were fifty-five weekly Socialist newspapers in Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and summer encampments that drew thousands of people.

James Green describes these Southwest radicals, in his book Grass-Roots Socialism, as ""indebted homesteaders, migratory tenant farmers, coal miners and railroad workers, 'redbone' lumberjacks from the piney woods, preachers and school teachers from the sunbaked prairies ... village artisans and atheists ... the unknown people who created the strongest regional Socialist movement in United States history."" Green continues:

The Socialist movement . . . was painstakingly organized by scores of former Populists, militant miners, and blacklisted railroad workers, who were assisted by a remarkable cadre of professional agitators and educators and inspired by occasional visits from national figures like Eugene V. Debs and Mother Jones. . . . This core of organizers grew to include indigenous dissenters. ... a much larger group of amateur agitators who canvassed the region selling newspapers, forming reading groups, organizing locals, and making soapbox speeches.

There was almost a religious fervor to the movement, as in the eloquence of Debs. In 1906, after the imprisonment in Idaho of Bill Haywood and two other officers of the Western Federation of Miners on an apparently faked murder charge, Debs wrote a naming article in the Appeal to Reason:

Murder has been plotted and is about to be executed in the name and under the forms of law. . ..

It is a foul plot; a damnable conspiracy; a hellish outrage. ...

If they attempt to murder Moyer, Haywood and their brothers, a million revolutionists, at least, will meet them with guns. .. .

Capitalist courts never have done, and never will do, anything for the working class. . . .

A special revolutionary convention of the proletariat . .. would be in order, and, if extreme measures are required, a general strike could be ordered and industry paralyzed as a preliminary to a general uprising.

If the plutocrats begin the program, we will end it.

Theodore Roosevelt, after reading this, sent a copy to his Attorney General, W. II. Moody, with a note: ""is it possible to proceed against Debs and the proprietor of this paper criminally?""

As the Socialists became more successful at the polls (Debs got 900,000 votes in 1912, double what he had in 1908), and more concerned with increasing that appeal, they became more critical of IWW tactics of ""sabotage"" and ""violence,"" and in 1913 removed Bill Haywood from the Socialist Party Executive Committee, claiming he advocated violence (although some of Debs's writings were far more inflammatory).

Women were active in the socialist movement, more as rank-and-file workers than as leaders-and, sometimes, as sharp critics of socialist policy. Helen Keller, for instance, the gifted blind-mute-deaf woman with her extraordinary social vision, commented on the expulsion of Bill Haywood in a letter to the New York Call:

It is with the deepest regret that I have read the attacks upon Comrade Haywood . .. such an ignoble strife between two factions which should be one, and that, too, at a must critical period in the struggle of the proletariat. ...

What? Are we to put difference of party tactics before the desperate needs of the workers? ... While countless women and children are breaking their hearts and ruining their bodies in long days of toil, we are fighting one another. Shame upon us!

Only 3 percent of the Socialist party's members were women in 1904. At the national convention that year, there were only eight women delegates. But in a few years, local socialist women's organizations, and a national magazine, Socialist Woman, began bringing more women into the party, so that by 1913, 15 percent of the membership was women. The editor of Socialist Woman, Josephine Conger-Kaneko, insisted on the importance of separate groups for women:

In the separate organization the most unsophisticated little woman may soon learn to preside over a meeting, to make motions, and to defend her stand with a little ""speech"". After a year or two of this sort of practice she is ready to work with the men. And there is a mighty difference between working with the men, and simply sitting in obedient reverence under the shadow of their aggressive power.

Socialist women were active in the feminist movement of the early 1990s. According to Kate Richards O'Hare, the Socialist leader from Oklahoma, New York women socialists were superbly organized. During the 1915 campaign in New York for a referendum on women's suffrage, in one day at the climax of the campaign, they distributed 60,000 English leaflets, 50,000 Yiddish leaflets, sold 2,500 one-cent books and 1,500 five-cent hooks, put up 40,000 stickers, and held 100 meetings.

But were there problems of women that went beyond politics and economics, that would not be solved automatically by a socialist system? Once the economic base of sexual oppression was corrected, would equality follow? Battling for the vote, or for anything less than revolutionary change-was that pointless? The argument became sharper as the women's movement of the early twentieth century grew, as women spoke out more, organized, protested, paraded-for the vote, and for recognition as equals in every sphere, including sexual relations and marriage.

Charlotte Perkins Oilman, whose writing emphasized the crucial question of economic equality between the sexes, wrote a poem called ""The Socialist and the Suffragist,"" ending with:

""A lifted world lifts women up,""
The Socialist explained.
""You cannot lift the world at all
While half of it is kept so small,""
the Suffragist maintained.
The world awoke, and tartly spoke:
""Your work is all the same;
Work together or work apart,
Work, each of you, with all your heart-
Just get into the game!""

When Susan Anthony, at eighty, went to hear Eugene Debs speak (twenty-five years before, he had gone to hear her speak, and they had not met since then), they clasped hands warmly, then had a brief exchange. She said, laughing: ""Give us suffrage, and we'll give you socialism,"" Debs replied: ""Give us socialism and we'll give you suffrage.""

There were women who insisted on uniting the two aims of socialism and feminism, like Crystal Eastman, who imagined new ways of men and women living together and retaining their independence, different from traditional marriage. She was a socialist, but wrote once that a woman ""knows that the whole of woman's slavery is not summed up in the profit system, nor her complete emancipation assured by the downfall of capitalism.""

In the first fifteen years of the twentieth century, there were more women in the labor force, more with experience in labor struggles. Some middle-class women, conscious of women's oppression and wanting to do something, were going to college and becoming aware of themselves as not just housewives. The historian William Chafe writes (Women and Equality):

Female college students were infused with a self-conscious sense of mission and a passionate commitment to improve the world. They became doctors, college professors, settlement house workers, business women, lawyers, and architects. Spirited by an intense sense of purpose as well as camaraderie, they set a remarkable record of accomplishment in the face of overwhelming odds. Jane Addams, Grace and Edith Abbott, Alice Hamilton, Julia Lathrop, Florence Kelley-all came out of this pioneering generation and set the agenda of social reform for the first two decades of the 20th century.

They were defying the culture of mass magazines, which were spreading the message of woman as companion, wife, homemaker. Some of these feminists married; some did not. All struggled with the problem of relations with men, like Margaret Sanger, pioneer of birth control education, who suffered a nervous breakdown inside an apparently happy but confining marriage; she had to leave husband and children to make a career for herself and feel whole again. Sanger had written in Woman and the New Race: ""No woman can call herself free who does not own and control her own body. No woman can call herself free until she can choose conscientiously whether she will or will not be a mother.""

It was a complicated problem. Kate Richards O'Hare, for example, believed in the home, but thought socialism would make that better. When she ran for Congress in 1910 in Kansas City she said: ""I long for domestic life, borne and children with every fiber of my being.. . . Socialism is needed to restore the home.""

On the other hand, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn wrote in her autobiography, Rebel Girl:

A domestic life and possibly a large family had no attraction for me. ... I wanted to speak and write, to travel, to meet people, to see places, to organize for the I.W.W. I saw no reason why I, as a woman, should give up my work for this. . . .

While many women in this time were radicals, socialists, anarchists, an even larger number were involved in the campaign for suffrage, and the mass support for feminism came from them. Veterans of trade union struggles joined the suffrage movement, like Rose Schneiderman of the Garment Workers. At a Cooper Union meeting in New York, she replied to a politician who said that women, given the vote, would lose their femininity:

Women in the laundries .. . stand for thirteen or fourteen hours in the terrible steam and heat with their hands in hot starch. Surely these women won't lose any more of their beauty and charm by putting a ballot in a ballot box once a year than they are likely to lose standing in foundries or laundries all year round.

Every spring in New York, the parades for women's suffrage kept growing. In 1912, a news report:

All along Fifth Avenue from Washington Square, where the parade formed, to 57th Street, where it disbanded, were gathered thousands of men and women of New York. They blocked every cross street on the line of march. Many were inclined to laugh and jeer, but none did. The sight of the impressive column of women striding five abreast up the middle of the street stifled all thought of ridicule. .. . women doctors, women lawyers . . . women architects, women artists, actresses and sculptors; women waitresses, domestics; a huge division of industrial workers ... all marched with an intensity and purpose that astonished the crowds that lined the streets.

From Washington, in the spring of 1913, came a New York Times report:

In a woman's suffrage demonstration to-day the capital saw the greatest parade of women in its history.... In the parade over 5000 women passed down Pennsylvania Avenue.... It was an astonishing demonstration. It was estimated ... that 500,000 persons watched the women march for their cause.

Some women radicals were skeptical. Emma Goldman, the anarchist and feminist, spoke her mind forcefully, as always, on the subject of women's suffrage:

Our modern fetish is universal suffrage.. . . The women of Australia and New Zealand can vote, and help make the laws. Are the labor conditions better there?. . .

The history of the political activities of man proves that they have given him absolutely nothing that he could not have achieved in a more direct, less costly, and more lasting manner. As a matter of fact, every inch of ground he has gained has been through a constant fight, a ceaseless struggle for self-assertion, and not through suffrage. There is no reason whatever to assume that woman, in her climb to emancipation, has been, or will be, helped by the ballot. . ..

Her development, her freedom, her independence, must come from and through herself. First, by asserting herself as a personality. Second, by refusing the right to anyone over her body; by refusing to bear children, unless she wants them; by refusing to be a servant to God, the State, society, the husband, the family, etc. by making her life simpler, but deeper and richer.. . . Only that, and not the ballot, will set woman free.. . .

And Helen Keller, writing in 1911 to a suffragist in England:

Our democracy is but a name. We vote? What does that mean? It means that we choose between two bodies of real, though not avowed, autocrats. We choose between Tweedledum and Tweedledee.. . .

You ask for votes for women. What good can votes do when ten-elevenths of the land of Great Britain belongs to 200,000 and only one-eleventh to the rest of the 40,000,000? Have your men with their millions of votes freed themselves from this injustice?

Emma Goldman was not postponing the changing of woman's condition to some future socialist era-she wanted action more direct, more immediate, than the vote. Helen Keller, while not an anarchist, also believed in continuous struggle outside the ballot box. Blind, deaf, she fought with her spirit, her pen. When she became active and openly socialist, the Brooklyn Eagle, which had previously treated her as a heroine, wrote that ""her mistakes spring out of the manifest limitations of her development."" Her response was not accepted by the Eagle, but printed in the New York Call. She wrote that when once she met the editor of the Brooklyn Eagle he complimented her lavishly. ""But now that I have come out for socialism he reminds me and the public that I am blind and deaf and especially liable to error. . . ."" She added:

Oh, ridiculous Brooklyn Eagle! What an ungallant bird it is! Socially blind and deaf, it defends an intolerable system, a system that is the cause of much of the physical blindness and deafness which we are trying to prevent. .. . The Eagle and I are at war. I hate the system which it represents.. .. When it fights back, let it fight fair.... It is not fair fighting or good argument to remind me and others that I cannot see or hear. I can read. I can read all the socialist books I have time for in English, German and French. If the editor of the Brooklyn Eagle should read some of them, he might be a wiser man, and make a better newspaper. If I ever contribute to the Socialist movement the book that I sometimes dream of, I know what I shall name it: Industrial Blindness and Social Deafness.

Mother Jones did not seem especially interested in the feminist movement. She was busy organizing textile workers and miners, and organizing their wives and children. One of her many feats was the organization of a children's march to Washington to demand the end of child labor (as the twentieth century opened, 284,000 children between the ages of ten and fifteen worked in mines, mills, factories). She described this:

In the spring of 1903, I went to Kensington, Pennsylvania, where seventy-five thousand textile workers were on strike. Of this number at least ten thousand were little children. The workers were striking for more pay and shorter hours. Every day little children came into Union Headquarters, some with their hands off, some with the thumb missing, some with their fingers off at the knuckle. They were stooped little things, round shouldered and skinny...

I asked some of the parents if they would let me have their little boys and girls for a week or ten days, promising to bring them back safe and sound. ... A man named Sweeny was marshal.... A few men and women went with me. .. . The children carried knapsacks on their backs in which was a knife and fork, a tin cup and plate.. .. One little fellow had a drum and another had a fife.... We carried banners that said: ... ""We want time to play... .

The children marched through New Jersey and New York and down to Oyster Bay to try to see President Theodore Roosevelt, but he refused to see them. ""But our march bad done its work. We had drawn the attention of the nation to the crime of child labor.""

That same year, children working sixty hours a week in textile mills in Philadelphia went on strike, carrying signs: ""WE WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL!"" ""55 HOURS OR NOTHING!""

One gets a sense of the energy and fire of some of those turn-of-the-century radicals by looking at the police record of Elizabeth Gurley Flynn:

1906-16, Organizer, lecturer for I.W.W.

1918-24, Organizer, Workers Defense Union

Arrested in New York, 1906, free-speech case, dismissed; active in Spokane, Washington, free-speech fight, 1909; arrested, Missoula, Montana, 1909, in free-speech fight of I.W.W., Spokane, Washington, free-speech fight of I.W.W, hundreds arrested; in Philadelphia arrested three times, 1911, at strike; meetings of Baldwin Locomotive Works; active in Lawrence textile strike, 1912; hotel-workers strike, 1912, New York; Paterson textile strike, 1913; defense work for Ettor-Giovanitti case, 1912; Mesaba Range strike, Minnesota, 1916; Everett IWW case, Spokane, Washington, 1916; Joe Hill defense, 1914. Arrested Duluth, Minnesota, 1917, charged with vagrancy under law passed to stop I.W.W. and pacifist speakers, case dismissed. Indicted in Chicago IWW case, 1917... .

Black women faced double oppression. A Negro nurse wrote to a newspaper in 1912:

We poor colored women wage-earners in the South are fighting a terrible battle. ... On the one hand, we are assailed by black men, who should be our natural protectors; and, whether in the cook kitchen, at the washtub, over the sewing machine, behind the baby carriage, or at the ironing board, we are but little more than pack horses, beasts of burden, slaves! ...

In this early part of the twentieth century, labeled by generations of white scholars as ""the Progressive period,"" lynchings were reported every week; it was the low point for Negroes, North and South, ""the nadir,"" as Rayford Logan, a black historian, put it. In 1910 there were 10 million Negroes in the United States, and 9 million of them were in the South.

The government of the United States (between 1901 and 1921, the Presidents were Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, Woodrow Wilson)-whether Republican or Democrat-watched Negroes being lynched, observed murderous riots against blacks in Statesboro, Georgia, Brownsville, Texas, and Atlanta, Georgia, and did nothing.

There were Negroes in the Socialist party, but the Socialist party did not go much out of its way to act on the race question. As Ray Ginger writes of Debs: ""When race prejudice was thrust at Debs, he always publicly repudiated it. He always insisted on absolute equality. But he failed to accept the view that special measures were sometimes needed to achieve this equality.""

Blacks began to organize: a National Afro-American Council formed in 1903 to protest against lynching, peonage, discrimination, disfranchisement; the National Association of Colored Women, formed around the same time, condemned segregation and lynchings. In Georgia in 1906 there was an Equal Rights Convention, which pointed to 260 Georgia Negroes lynched since 1885. It asked the right to vote, the right to enter the militia, to be on juries. It agreed blacks should work hard. ""And at the same time we must agitate, complain, protest and keep protesting against the invasion of our manhood rights.. ,.""

W. E. B. Du Bois, teaching in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1905, sent out a letter to Negro leaders throughout the country, calling them to a conference just across the Canadian border from Buffalo, near Niagara Falls. It was the start of the ""Niagara Movement.""

Du Bois, born in Massachusetts, the first black to receive a Ph.D. degree from Harvard University (1895), had just written and published his poetic, powerful book The Souls of Black Folk. Du Bois was a Socialist sympathizer, although only briefly a party member.

One of his associates in calling the Niagara meeting was William Monroe Trotter, a young black man in Boston, of militant views, who edited a weekly newspaper, the Guardian. In it he attacked the moderate ideas of Booker T. Washington. When, in the summer of 1903, Washington spoke to an audience of two thousand at a Boston church, Trotter and his supporters prepared nine provocative questions, which caused a commotion and led to fistfights. Trotter and a friend were arrested. This may have added to the spirit of indignation which led Du Bois to spearhead the Niagara meeting. The tone of the Niagara group was strong:

We refuse to allow the impression to remain that the Negro-American assents to inferiority, is submissive under oppression and apologetic before insults. Through helplessness we may submit, but the voice of protest of ten million Americans must never cease to assail the ears of their fellows so long as America is unjust.

A race riot in Springfield, Illinois, prompted the formation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in 1910. Whites dominated the leadership of the new organization; Du Bois was the only black officer. He was also the first editor of the NAACP periodical The Crisis. The NAACP concentrated on legal action and education, but Du Bois represented in it that spirit which was embodied in the Niagara movement's declaration: ""Persistent manly agitation is the way to liberty.""

What was clear in this period to blacks, to feminists, to labor organizers and socialists, was that they could not count on the national government. True, this was the ""Progressive Period,"" the start of the Age of Reform; but it was a reluctant reform, aimed at quieting the popular risings, not making fundamental changes.

What gave it the name ""Progressive"" was that new laws were passed. Under Theodore Roosevelt, there was the Meat Inspection Act, the Hepburn Act to regulate railroads and pipelines, a Pure Food and Drug Act. Under Taff, the Mann-Elkins Act put telephone and telegraph systems under the regulation of the Interstate Commerce Commission. In Woodrow Wilson's presidency, the Federal Trade Commission was introduced to control the growth of monopolies, and the Federal Reserve Act to regulate the country's money and banking system. Under Taft were proposed the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution, allowing a graduated income tax, and the Seventeenth Amendment, providing for the election of Senators directly by popular vote instead of by the state legislatures, as the original Constitution provided. Also at this time, a number of states passed laws regulating wages and hours, providing for safety inspection of factories and compensation for injured workmen.

It was a time of public investigations aimed at soothing protest. In 1913 the Pujo Committee of Congress studied the concentration of power in the banking industry, and the Commission on Industrial Relations of the Senate held hearings on labor-management conflict.

Undoubtedly, ordinary people benefited to some extent from these changes. The system was rich, productive, complex; it could give enough of a share of its riches to enough of the working class to create a protective shield between the bottom and the top of the society. A study of immigrants in New York between 1905 and 1915 finds that 32 percent of Italians and Jews rose out of the manual class to higher levels (although not to much higher levels). But it was also true that many Italian immigrants did not find the opportunities inviting enough for them to stay. In one four-year period, seventy-three Italians left New York for every one hundred that arrived. Still, enough Italians became construction workers, enough Jews became businessmen and professionals, to create a middle-class cushion for class conflict.

Fundamental conditions did not change, however, for the vast majority of tenant farmers, factory workers, slum dwellers, miners, farm laborers, working men and women, black and white. Robert Wiebe sees in the Progressive movement an attempt by the system to adjust to changing conditions in order to achieve more stability. ""Through rules with impersonal sanctions, it sought continuity and predictability in a world of endless change. It assigned far greater power to government . .. and it encouraged the centralization of authority."" Harold Faulkner concluded that this new emphasis on strong government was for the benefit of ""the most powerful economic groups.""

Gabriel Kolko calls it the emergence of ""political capitalism,"" where the businessmen took firmer control of the political system because the private economy was not efficient enough to forestall protest from below. The businessmen, Kolko says, were not opposed to the new reforms; they initiated them, pushed them, to stabilize the capitalist system in a time of uncertainty and trouble.

For instance, Theodore Roosevelt made a reputation for himself as a ""trust-buster"" (although his successor, Taft, a ""conservative,"" while Roosevelt was a ""Progressive,"" launched more antitrust suits than did Roosevelt). In fact, as Wiebe points out, two of J. P. Morgan's men- Elbert Gary, chairman of U.S. Steel, and George Perkins, who would later become a campaigner for Roosevelt- ""arranged a general understanding with Roosevelt by which . . . they would cooperate in any investigation by the Bureau of Corporations in return for a guarantee of their companies' legality."" They would do this through private negotiations with the President. ""A gentleman's agreement between reasonable people,"" Wiebe says, with a bit of sarcasm.

The panic of 1907, as well as the growing strength of the Socialists, Wobblies, and trade unions, speeded the process of reform. According to Wiebe: ""Around 1908 a qualitative shift in outlook occurred among large numbers of these men of authority.. . ."" The emphasis was now on ""enticements and compromises."" It continued with Wilson, and ""a great many reform-minded citizens indulged the illusion of a progressive fulfillment.""

What radical critics now say of those reforms was said at the time (1901) by the Bankers' Magazine: ""As the business of the country has learned the secret of combination, it is gradually subverting the power of the politician and rendering him subservient to its purposes. . , .""

There was much to stabilize, much to protect. By 1904, 318 trusts, with capital of more than seven billion dollars, controlled 40% of the U.S. manufacturing.

In 1909, a manifesto of the new Progressivism appeared-a book called The Promise of American Life by Herbert Croly, editor of the New Republic and an admirer of Theodore Roosevelt. He saw the need for discipline and regulation if the American system were to continue. Government should do more, he said, and he hoped to see the ""sincere and enthusiastic imitation of heroes and saints""- by whom he may have meant Theodore Roosevelt.

Richard Hofstadter, in his biting chapter on the man the public saw as the great lover of nature and physical fitness, the war hero, the Boy Scout in the White House, says: ""The advisers to whom Roosevelt listened were almost exclusively representatives of industrial and finance capital-men like Hanna, Robert Bacon, and George W. Perkins of the House of Morgan, Elihu Root, Senator Nelson W. Aldrich ... and James Stillman of the Rockefeller interests."" Responding to his worried brother-in-law writing from Wall Street, Roosevelt replied: ""I intend to be most conservative, but in the interests of the corporations themselves and above all in the interests of the country.""

Roosevelt supported the regulatory Hepburn Act because he feared something worse. He wrote to Henry Cabot Lodge that the railroad lobbyists who opposed the bill were wrong: ""I think they are very shortsighted not to understand that to beat it means to increase the movement for government ownership of the railroads."" His action against the trusts was to induce them to accept government regulation, in order to prevent destruction. He prosecuted the Morgan railroad monopoly in the Northern Securities Case, considering it an antitrust victory, but it hardly changed anything, and, although the Sherman Act provided for criminal penalties, there was no prosecution of the men who had planned the monopoly-Morgan, Harriman, Hill.

As for Woodrow Wilson, Hofstadter points out he was a conservative from the start. As a historian and political scientist, Wilson wrote (The State): ""In politics nothing radically novel may safely be attempted."" He urged ""slow and gradual"" change. This attitude toward labor, Hofstadter says, was ""generally hostile,"" and he spoke of the ""crude and ignorant minds"" of the Populists.

James Weinstein (The Corporate Ideal in the Liberal State) has studied the reforms of the Progressive period, especially the process by which business and government, sometimes with the aid of labor leaders, worked out the legislative changes they thought necessary. Weinstein sees ""a conscious and successful effort to guide and control the economic and social policies of federal, state, and municipal governments by various business groupings in their own long-range interest..."" While the ""original impetus"" for reform came from protesters and radicals, ""in the current century, particularly on the federal level, few reforms were enacted without the tacit approval, if not the guidance, of the large corporate interests."" These interests assembled liberal reformers and intellectuals to aid them in such matters.

Weinstein's definition of liberalism-as a means of stabilizing the system in the interests of big business-is different from that of the liberals themselves. Arthur Schlesinger writes: ""Liberalism in America has been ordinarily the movement on the part of the other sections of society to restrain the power of the business community."" If Schlesinger is describing the hope or intent of these other sections, he may be right. If he is describing the actual effect of these liberal reforms, that restraint has not happened.

The controls were constructed skillfully. In 1900, a man named Ralph Easley, a Republican and conservative, a schoolteacher and journalist, organized the National Civic Federation. Its aim was to get better relations between capital and labor. Its officers were mostly big businessmen, and important national politicians, but its first vice-president, for a long time, was Samuel Gompers of the AFL. Not all big businesses liked what the National Civic Federation was doing. Easley called these critics anarchists, opposed to the rational organization of the system. ""In fact,"" Easley wrote, ""our enemies are the Socialists among the labor people and the anarchists among the capitalists.""

The NCF wanted a more sophisticated approach to trade unions, seeing them as an inevitable reality, therefore wanting to come to agreements with them rather than fight with them: better to deal with a conservative union than face a militant one. After the Lawrence textile strike of 1912, John Golden, head of the conservative AFL Textile Union Workers, wrote Easley that the strike had given manufacturers ""a very rapid education"" and ""some of them are falling all over themselves now to do business with our organization.""

The National Civic Federation did not represent all opinions in the business world; the National Association of Manufacturers didn't want to recognize organized labor in any way. Many businessmen did not want even the puny reforms proposed by the Civic Federation-but the Federation's approach represented the sophistication and authority of the modern state, determined to do what was best for the capitalist class as a whole, even if this irritated some capitalists. The new approach was concerned with the long-range stability of the system, even at the cost, sometimes, of short-term profits.

Thus, the Federation drew up a model workmen's compensation bill in 1910, and the following year twelve states passed laws for compensation or accident insurance. When the Supreme Court said that year that New York's workmen's compensation law was unconstitutional because it deprived corporations of property without due process of law, Theodore Roosevelt was angry. Such decisions, he said, added ""immensely to the strength of the Socialist Party."" By 1920, forty-two states had workmen's compensation laws. As Weinstein says: ""It represented a growing maturity and sophistication on the part of many large corporation leaders who had come to understand, as Theodore Roosevelt often told them, that social reform was truly conservative.""

As for the Federal Trade Commission, established by Congress in 1914 presumably to regulate trusts, a leader of the Civic Federation reported after several years of experience with it that it ""has apparently been carrying on its work with the purpose of securing the confidence of well- intentioned business men, members of the great corporations as well as others.""

In this period, cities also put through reforms, many of them giving power to city councils instead of mayors, or hiring city managers. The idea was more efficiency, more stability. ""The end result of the movements was to place city government firmly in the hands of the business class,"" Weinstein says. What reformers saw as more democracy in city government, urban historian Samuel Hays sees as the centralization of power in fewer hands, giving business and professional men more direct control over city government.

The Progressive movement, whether led by honest reformers like Senator Robert La Follette of Wisconsin or disguised conservatives like Roosevelt (who was the Progressive party candidate for President in 1912), seemed to understand it was fending off socialism. The Milwaukee Journal, a Progressive organ, said the conservatives ""fight socialism blindly . .. while the Progressives fight it intelligently and seek to remedy the abuses and conditions upon which it thrives.""

Frank Munsey, a director of U.S. Steel, writing to Roosevelt, seeing him as the best candidate for 1912, confided in him that the United States must move toward a more ""parental guardianship of the people"" who needed ""the sustaining and guiding hand of the State."" It was ""the work of the state to think for the people and plan for the people,"" the steel executive said.

It seems quite clear that much of this intense activity for Progressive reform was intended to head off socialism. Easley talked of ""the menace of Socialism as evidenced by its growth in the colleges, churches, newspapers."" In 1910, Victor Berger became the first member of the Socialist party elected to Congress; in 1911, seventy-three Socialist mayors were elected, and twelve hundred lesser officials in 340 cities and towns. The press spoke of ""The Rising Tide of Socialism.""

A privately circulated memorandum suggested to one of the departments of the National Civic Federation: ""In view of the rapid spread in the United States of socialistic doctrines,"" what was needed was ""a carefully planned and wisely directed effort to instruct public opinion as to the real meaning Of socialism."" The memorandum suggested that the campaign ""must be very skillfully and tactfully carried out,"" that it ""should not violently attack socialism and anarchism as such"" but should be ""patient and persuasive"" and defend three ideas: ""individual liberty; private property; and inviolability of contract.""

It is hard to say how many Socialists saw clearly how useful reform was to capitalism, but in 1912, a left-wing Socialist from Connecticut, Robert LaMonte, wrote: ""Old age pensions and insurance against sickness, accident and unemployment are cheaper, are better business than jails, poor houses, asylums, hospitals."" He suggested that progressives would work for reforms, but Socialists must make only ""impossible demands,"" which would reveal the limitations of the reformers.

Did the Progressive reforms succeed in doing what they intended- stabilize the capitalist system by repairing its worst defects, blunt the edge of the Socialist movement, restore some measure of class peace in a time of increasingly bitter clashes between capital and labor? To some extent, perhaps. But the Socialist party continued to grow. The IWW continued to agitate. And shortly after Woodrow Wilson took office there began in Colorado one of the most bitter and violent struggles between workers and corporate capital in the history of the country.

This was the Colorado coal strike that began in September 1913 and culminated in the ""Ludlow Massacre"" of April 1914. Eleven thousand miners in southern Colorado, mostly foreign-born- Greeks, Italians, Serbs-worked for the Colorado Fuel & Iron Corporation, which was owned by the Rockefeller family. Aroused by the murder of one of their organizers, they went on strike against low pay, dangerous conditions, and feudal domination of their lives in towns completely controlled by the mining companies. Mother Jones, at this time an organizer for the United Mine Workers, came into the area, fired up the miners with her oratory, and helped them in those critical first months of the strike, until she was arrested, kept in a dungeon like cell, and then forcibly expelled from the state.

When the strike began, the miners were immediately evicted from their shacks in the mining towns. Aided by the United Mine Workers Union, they set up tents in the nearby hills and carried on the strike, the picketing, from these tent colonies. The gunmen hired by the Rockefeller interests-the Baldwin-Felts Detective Agency-using Gatling guns and rifles, raided the tent colonies. The death list of miners grew, but they hung on, drove back an armored train in a gun battle, fought to keep out strikebreakers. With the miners resisting, refusing to give in, the mines not able to operate, the Colorado governor (referred to by a Rockefeller mine manager as ""our little cowboy governor"") called out the National Guard, with the Rockefellers supplying the Guard's wages.

The miners at first thought the Guard was sent to protect them, and greeted its arrivals with flags and cheers. They soon found out the Guard was there to destroy the strike. The Guard brought strikebreakers in under cover of night, not telling them there was a strike. Guardsmen beat miners, arrested them by the hundreds, rode down with their horses parades of women in the streets of Trinidad, the central town in the area. And still the miners refused to give in. When they lasted through the cold winter of 1913-1914, it became clear that extraordinary measures would be needed to break the strike.

In April 1914, two National Guard companies were stationed in the hills overlooking the largest tent colony of strikers, the one at Ludlow, housing a thousand men, women, children. On the morning of April 20, a machine gun attack began on the tents. The miners fired back. Their leader, a Greek named Lou Tikas, was lured up into the hills to discuss a truce, then shot to death by a company of National Guardsmen. The women and children dug pits beneath the tents to escape the gunfire. At dusk, the Guard moved down from the hills with torches, set fire to the tents, and the families fled into the hills; thirteen people were killed by gunfire.

The following day, a telephone linesman going through the ruins of the Ludlow tent colony lifted an iron cot covering a pit in one of the tents and found the charred, twisted bodies of eleven children and two women. This became known as the Ludlow Massacre.

The news spread quickly over the country. In Denver, the United Mine Workers issued a ""Call to Arms""-""Gather together for defensive purposes all arms and ammunition legally available."" Three hundred armed strikers marched from other tent colonies into the Ludlow area, cut telephone and telegraph wires, and prepared for battle. Railroad workers refused to take soldiers from Trinidad to Ludlow. At Colorado Springs, three hundred union miners walked off their jobs and headed for the Trinidad district, carrying revolvers, rifles, shotguns.

In Trinidad itself, miners attended a funeral service for the twenty-six dead at Ludlow, then walked from the funeral to a nearby building, where arms were stacked for them. They picked up rifles and moved into the hills, destroying mines, killing mine guards, exploding mine shafts. The press reported that ""the hills in every direction seem suddenly to be alive with men.""

In Denver, eighty-two soldiers in a company on a troop train headed for Trinidad refused to go. The press reported: ""The men declared they would not engage in the shooting of women and children. They hissed the 350 men who did start and shouted imprecations at them.""

Five thousand people demonstrated in the rain on the lawn in front of the state capital at Denver asking that the National Guard officers at Ludlow be tried for murder, denouncing the governor as an accessory. The Denver Cigar Makers Union voted to send five hundred armed men to Ludlow and Trinidad. Women in the United Garment Workers Union in Denver announced four hundred of their members had volunteered as nurses to help the strikers.

All over the country there were meetings, demonstrations. Pickets marched in front of the Rockefeller office at 26 Broadway, New York City. A minister protested in front of the church where Rockefeller sometimes gave sermons, and was clubbed by the police.

The New York Times carried an editorial on the events in Colorado, which were now attracting international attention. The Times emphasis was not on the atrocity that had occurred, but on the mistake in tactics that had been made. Its editorial on the Ludlow Massacre began: ""Somebody blundered...."" Two days later, with the miners armed and in the hills of the mine district, the Times wrote: ""With the deadliest weapons of civilization in the hands of savage-minded men, there can be no telling to what lengths the war in Colorado will go unless it is quelled by force.. -. The President should turn his attention from Mexico long enough to take stern measures in Colorado.""

The governor of Colorado asked for federal troops to restore order, and Woodrow Wilson complied. This accomplished, the strike petered out. Congressional committees came in and took thousands of pages of testimony. The union had not won recognition. Sixty-six men, women, and children had been killed. Not one militiaman or mine guard had been indicted for crime.

Still, Colorado had been a scene of ferocious class conflict, whose emotional repercussions had rolled through the entire country. The threat of class rebellion was clearly still there in the industrial conditions of the United States, in the undeterred spirit of rebellion among working people- whatever legislation had been passed, whatever liberal reforms were on the books, whatever investigations were undertaken and words of regret and conciliation uttered.

The Times had referred to Mexico. On the morning that the bodies were discovered in the tent pit at Ludlow, American warships were attacking Vera Cruz, a city on the coast of Mexico-bombarding it, occupying it, leaving a hundred Mexicans dead-because Mexico had arrested American sailors and refused to apologize to the United States with a twenty-one-gun salute. Could patriotic fervor and the military spirit cover up class struggle? Unemployment, hard times, were growing in 1914. Could guns divert attention and create some national consensus against an external enemy? It surely was a coincidence-the bombardment of Vera Cruz, the attack on the Ludlow colony. Or perhaps it was, as someone once described human history, ""the natural selection of accidents."" Perhaps the affair in Mexico was an instinctual response of the system for its own survival, to create a unity of fighting purpose among a people torn by internal conflict.

The bombardment of Vera Cruz was a small incident. But in four months the First World War would begin in Europe.",Howard Zinn,1994,"[94, 84]",2
367,I Never Knew Love,"[Verse 1]
Whenever I wake up
And I'd be feeling down
I never realized where I was bound
I heard someone knocking at my door
Asking to come in
I opened the door and let my Jesus in
Now that I wake up
And now longer feeling down
I finally realized where I was bound

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm glad that I opened up the door
To let my Jesus in
He entered my life and gave me peace within

I never knew love until I took up
The time to open the door
And I, I feel satisfied down in my soul
I never knew love until I opened the door

That Jesus gave to me
A song that I sing of love

I feel down in my heart

Hey yo, Doctor, here's another proper track
And it's phat, watch the sniper, time to pay the piper
And let that real shit provoke
See, you's a wannabe 'loc, and you'll get smoked, and I hope
That your fans understand when you talk about sprayin' me
The same records that you makin' is payin' me
Motherfuck Dre! Motherfuck Snoop! Motherfuck Death Row!
Yo, and here comes my left blow
'Cause I'm the E-A-Z-Y-E and this is the season
To let the real motherfuckin' G's in
You're like a kid, you found a pup, and now you're dapper
But tell me, where the fuck you found an anorexic rapper?
Talkin' 'bout who you gon' squabble with and who you shoot
You're only sixty pounds when you're wet and wearin' boots
(Damn, E, they tried to fade you on Dre Day)
But Dre Day only meant Eazy's payday
All of a sudden Dr. Dre is the G Thang
But on his own album cover he was a she-thang

Every day it's a new rapper claimin' to be dapper than the Dresta
Softer than a bitch but portray the role of gangsta
Ain't broke a law in your life
Yet every time you rap you yap about the guns and knife
Just take a good look at the nigga and you'll capture
The fact that the master is simply just an actor
Who mastered the bang and the slang and the mental
Of niggas in Compton, Watts, and South Central
Never ever once have you ran with the turf
But yet in every verse claim you used to do the dirt
But tell me, who's a witness to your fuckin' work?
So you never had no bid'ness, so save the drama, jerk!
Niggas straight kill me, knowin' that they pranksters
This is goin' out to you studio gangstas
See, I did dirt, put in work, and many niggas can vouch that
So since I got stripes, I got the right to rap about that
But niggas like you, I gotta hate ya
'Cause I'm just tired of suburbia niggas
Talkin' about they come from projects
Knowin' you ain't seen the parts of the streets, G
Think you started tryna bang around the time of the peace treaty
Wearin' khakis and mob while you rhyme
Little fag tried to sag, but you're floodin' at the same time
And your set don't accept ya; scared to kick it with your homies
'Cause you know they don't respect ya
So, nigga please, check nuts
Before you step to these muthaphuckkin' real G's

[Verse 3: B.G. Knocc Out]
Well, it's the Knocc Out, definition ""Original baby gangsta""
Approach me like you hard, motherfucker, I'ma bank ya
Shank ya, with my fuckin' shank, if I have to
Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg are fuckin' actors
Pranksters, studio gangstas, busters
But this time you're dealin' with some real motherfuckers
G's, nigga please, don't try to step
'Cause if you do, then a peeled cap is all that would be left
See, young niggas like me will break you off somethin'
Claimin' my city — but Dre, you ain't from Compton
Niggas like y'all is what I call wannabes
And ain't shit compared to real muthaphuckkin' G's

[Hook]
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
Yo, Dre! (What's up?)

[Verse 4: Eazy-E]
I never met a O.G. who never did shit wrong
You tried to diss the Eazy-E, so now, nigga, it's on
You and your Doggy Dogg think that y'all hoggin' shit
Both of you bitches can come and suck my Doggy dick
Beatin' up a bitch don't make you shit, but then again
Some niggas think it makes a man
Damn, it's a trip how a nigga could switch so quick
From wearin' lipstick to smokin' on chronic at picnics
And now you think you're bigger
But to me you ain't nothin' but a bitch-ass nigga
That ain't worth a food stamp
And at Death Row, I hear you gettin' treated like boot camp
Gotta follow your sergeant's directions
Or get your ass pumped with the Smith & Wesson
Learn a lesson from the Eaze
Stay in your place and don't step to real muthaphuckkin' G's

These niggas talking that beef shit
We'll check into it like the room's cheap

Ain't got nothing left to prove, unless I got to prove it in court
Live fast, die young, and leave a beautiful corpse, yes, Lord
My nigga order like twenty bricks
I sent five bricks with four chicks
Riding with these guns, that's carpooling
Bought extra clips when I dove in

Nigga, miss me with that ho shit
Kill all rats, I toast to that
And watch everybody I toast wit
Kill everybody you close with
Just don’t stick your nose in my bullshit
Cause I close it like a clothespin
The people that I rolls with
Will leave holes in what you drove in
If anyone in that car live
You tell that nigga I owe him, yeah
I got my mind right, my money right
My head on my shoulder

And pop up like new toast

My shadow don’t get too close
To that new nigga with my old hoes: kudos
For my niggas on Rikers Island back there playing Uno
Getting swole like Popeye for niggas walking around like Bruno
I’m in the bed with a duo, laid up like two points
AK to your face; knock half off, like coupons
Too cool for school, but I sold cool points to schoolboys
Tell the cops, We don’t name drop, that's like droppin newborns

You so crazy, Tunechi

[Verse 3]
Nigga tell me somethin I don't know
Like where the fuck did my heart go?
And show me somethin I haven’t seen
And give me what helped Martin sleep
On the same night he had a dream
And take me to where I’ve never been
But not to where I never be in
I ain’t never scared, but I’m scared of me
Me vs. Me, I need a referee
Need weaponry, especially if the treasury in jeopardy
Fuck deputy, big letter B
Need equity, need credit cleaned
To trafficking from peddling like everything
From amphetamines to medicine

You can call me Eddie cause I stay ready
My family call me Eduardo
I’m music to these bitches ears
I hit that ass like the wrong note
My bitch bad, with corn rows
With boots on in farm clothes
You can find me prancin in the finest mansion
With the finest dancer with a height advantage
She want cocaine, pills, and weed, liquor and dick
She gotta micro manage
I'm just eatin rappers
They go nice in salads
With some diced up carrots

Now little Lisa's only nine years old
She's tryin to figure out why the world is so cold
Why she's all alone and they never met her family
Momma's always gone and she never met her daddy
Part of her is missin and nobody'll listen
Momma's on drugs gettin high up in the kitchen
Bringin home men at different hours of the night
Startin with some laughs, usually endin in a fight
Sneakin in her room when her momma's knocked out
Tryin to have his way and little Lisa says ouch
She tries to resist but then all he does is beat her
Tries to tell her mom but her momma don't believe her
Lisa's stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get some clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and never come back (Like this)

Teachers ask questions, she's makin up excuses
Bleedin on the inside, cryin on the out
It's only one girl really knows what she's about
Her name is little Stacy and they become friends
Promise that they'll always be tight 'til the end
Until one day lil' Stacy gets shot
A drive-by bullet went stray up on her block
Now Nicole's stuck up in a world on her own

Emotions run deep as she thinks she's in love
So there's no protection, he's usin no glove
Never thinkin 'bout the consequences of her actions
Livin for today and not tomorrow's satisfaction
The days go by and her belly gets big
The father bails out, he ain't ready for a kid
Knowin her momma would blow it all out of proportion
Plus she lives poor so no money for abortion
Erica is stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home

Boi-1da, what's poppin'?
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Countin' money, you know how it goes
Pray the real live forever, man
Pray the fakes get exposed
I want that Ferrari, then I swerve
I want that Bugatti, just to hurt
I ain't rockin' my jewelry, that's on purpose
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it
I don't like how serious they take themselves
I've always been me, I guess I know myself
Shakiness, man, I don't have no time for that
My city too turned up, I'll take the fine for that
This been where you find me at
That's been where you find me at
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling
He put me on to the finer things
Had a job sellin' Girbaud jeans
I had a yellow TechnoMarine
Then Kanye dropped, it was polos and backpacks
Man, that was when Ethan was pushin' a Subaru hatchback
Man, I'm talkin' way before hashtags
I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes

You know how that should go
You know how that should go
Don't fuck with them niggas, they too irrational, woah

[Verse 2]
This is that nasty flow
Top boy in this shit, I'm so international
Reps up is in here
Got P Reign and Chubby and TJ and Winnie and whoa
Yeah, and you know how that should go
I might declare it a holiday as soon as Baka get back on the road
Yeah, but you know how that should go
They so irrational, they don't wanna patch it up
They wanna mash it up, woah
My nigga Jibba, he whip it, I ride in the passenger
I'm way up, I stay up, I'm two up, I'm three up
I had to get back to you, woah
I'm turnin' into a nigga that thinks about money and women
Like 24/7, that's where my life took me
That's just how shit happened to go
And you know
Runnin' through the 6 with my, with my

[Chorus]
I was running through the 6 with my woes
And you know how that should go
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that should go

377,Both Sides Of The Story,"[Verse 1]
Find yourself in the gutter in a lonely part of town
Where death waits in the darkness with a weapon to cut some stranger down
Sleeping with an empty bottle, he's a sad and an empty hearted man
All he needs is a job, and a little respect, so he can get out while he can

[Chorus 1]
We always need to hear both sides of the story
Both sides of the story

[Verse 2]
A neighbourhood peace is shattered it's the middle of the night
Young faces hide in the shadows, while they watch their mother and father fight
He says she's been unfaithful, she says her love for him has gone
And the brother shrugs to his sister and says ""looks like it's just us from now on""

[Chorus 1]
All we always need to hear both sides of the story
We need to hear both sides of the story

[Chorus 2]
And the lights are all on, the world is watching now
People looking for truth, we must not fail them now
Be sure, before we close our eyes
Don't walk away from here
Until you hear both sides

[Verse 3]
Here we are all gathered in what seems to be the center of the storm
Neighbors once friendly now stand each side of the line that has been drawn
They've been fighting here for years, but now there's killing on the streets
While small coffins are lined up sadly, now united in defeat

[Chorus 1]
All we always need to hear both sides of the story

[Chorus 2]
And the lights are all on, the world is watching now
People looking for truth, we must not fail them now
Be sure, before we close our eyes
Don't walk away from here
Until you see both sides

[Verse 4]
White man turns the corner, finds himself within a different world
Ghetto kid grabs his shoulder, throws him up against the wall
He says ""Would you respect me if I didn't have this gun""
""Because without it, I don't get it, and that's why I carry one""

[Outro]
We always need to hear both sides of the story
Both sides of the story
Oh, both sides of the story
Yes, both sides of the story
Oh, both sides of the story
Both sides of the story
Both sides of the story
Both sides of the story
Both sides of the story
Both sides of the story
Both sides of the story
Both sides of the story
Both sides of the story

Both sides of the story

379,Come Clean,"[Produced by DJ Premier]

[Verse 1]
You wanna front—what? Jump up and get bucked
If you're feeling lucky duck then press your luck
I snatch fake-gangster emcees and make 'em faggot flambé
Your nine spray, my mind spray
Malignant mist that'll leave comp' defunct
The result's your remains stuffed in a car trunk
You couldn't come to the jungles of the East popping that yang
You won't survive, get live, catching wreck is our thing
I don't gang bang or shoot out bang bang
The relentless lyrics the only dope I slang
I'm a true master you can check my credentials
'Cause I choose to use my infinite potential
Got a freaky, freaky, freaky, freaky flow
Control the mic like Fidel Castro locked Cuba
So deep that you can't scuba dive
My jive's origin is unknown like the Jubas
I've accumulated honeys all across the map
'Cause I'd rather bust a nut than bust a cap
In your back in fact my rap snaps your sacroiliac
I'm the mack so I don't need to tote a MAC
My attack is purely mental and its nature's not hate
It's meant to wake ya up out of your brainwashed state
Stagnate nonsense, for if you persist
You'll get your snotbox bust you press up on this
I flip, hoes dip, none of the real niggas skip
You don't know enough math to count the mics that I've ripped
Peep the Dirty Rotten scamp as his verbal weapons spit

[Sampled Hook]
Uh-oh! Heads up 'cause we're dropping some shit!
(Scratched x5)

[Verse 2]
Real, rough and rugged, shine like a gold nugget
Every time I pick up the microphone I drug it
Unplug it on chumps with the gangster babble
Leave your nines at home and bring your skills to the battle
You're rattling on and on and ain't saying nothing
That's why you got snuffed when you bumped heads with Dirty Rotten
Have you forgotten I'll tap your jaw?
I also kick like kung fu flicks by Run Run Shaw
Made frauds bleed every time I G'd
'Cause I've perfected my drunken style like Sam Seed
Pseudo psychos, I play like Michael Jackson
When I'm busting ass and breaking backs
Inhale the putrified aroma
Breathe too deep and you'll wind up coma‒
Toast the king I'm hard like a fifth of vodka
And bring your clique 'cause I'm a hard rock knocker
I gotcha out on a limb, about to push you off the plank
Let you draw your chronz but your burner shot blanks
When the East is in the house you should come equipped

[Sampled Hook]
Uh-oh! Heads up 'cause we're dropping some shit!
(Scratched x9)

[Verse 3]
Fly like a jet, sting like a hornet
Knuckleheads get live and set it off if you want it
Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is crushing crews, no joke
With styles more fatal than second hand smoke
Don't provoke the wrath of this rhyme inventor
'Cause I blow up spots like the World Trade Center
Come with the super trooper on his assault mission
The TEC's technique 'cause he's a technician
Wishing he'll go away won't help the weapons stop
The skills are shot 'cause any idiot can let off a Glock
Hard rocks melt in the clutch of the sun toucher
You claim you got beef on the streets, so what ya
Gonna do when real niggas roll up on you
And you don't got your crew
Pull your Glock, hmm...? But you don't got the heart
You was webbed straight from the start
Bought a tool and didn't learn how to use it
Got lost in Brooklyn so you had to lose it
Just for fronting you got that ass whipped

[Sampled Hook]
Uh-oh! Heads up 'cause we're dropping some shit!

380,I'd Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That),"[Intro]
And I would do anything for love
I'd run right into hell and back
I would do anything for love
I'll never lie to you and that's a fact

But I'll never forget the way you feel right now
- Oh no
- No way
And I would do anything for love
But I won't do that,
No I won't do that

Anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No I won't do that

[Verse 1]
And some days it don't come easy
And some days it don't come hard
Some days it don't come at all
And these are the days that never end

And some nights you're breathing fire
And some nights you're carved in ice
Some nights you're like nothing I've ever
Seen before, or will again

[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe I'm crazy
Oh it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me
No one else can save me now but you

As long as the planets are turning
As long as the stars are burning
As long as your dreams are coming true-
You better believe it!

[Chorus]
That I would do anything for love!
And I'll be there till the final act
And I would do anything for love!
And I'll take the vow and seal a pact

But I'll never forgive myself if we don't go all the way
Tonight

And I would do anything for love!
Oh I would do anything for love!
Oh I would do anything for love!
But I won't do that!
No I won't do that!

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that...

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that...

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do that...

[Verse 2]
And some days I pray for Silence
And some days I pray for Soul
Some days I just pray to the God
Of Sex and Drums and Rock 'N' Roll

And some nights I lose the feeling
And some nights I lose control
Some nights I just lose it all
When I watch you dance and the thunder rolls

[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe I'm lonely
That's all I'm qualified to be
There's just one and only
One and only promise I can keep

As long as the wheels are turning
As long as the fires are burning
As long as your prayers are coming true
You better believe it!

[Chorus]
That I would do anything for love!
And you know it's true and thats a fact
I would do anything for love!
And there'll never be no turning back

But I'll never do it better than I do it with you
So long
So long

And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love
But I won't do that, No
No. No, I won't do that!

But I just won't do that...

I would do anything for love
Anything you've been dreaming of
But I just won't do...

But I'll never stop dreaming of you every night of my life
No way

And I would do anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love
But I won't do that
No I won't do that

Ain't nothin' shining more than you, boy

I'm out of my head, out of my mind, oh, I
If you let me, I'll be
Out of my dress and into your arms tonight
Yeah, I'm lost without it
Feels like I'm always waitin'
I need you to come get me
Out of my head, and into your arms tonight
Tonight (yeah)

[Verse 1: Witt Lowry]
I don't mean to make you wait, just the pressure's been gettin' heavy
I know if I fuck us up, we'll be over, done, you'll forget me
Forget me, I'm feelin' bad that I act this way, 'cause you let me
They call me king, but I know my queen will be there to check me
Last year, was runnin' 'round 45th lookin' for SoHo
Last night, was ridin' down Rodeo lookin' for no ho
It's crazy what can change in a year, think that you know though
Go back and forth like a yo-yo, they live their life for the photos
They see me, I'm actin' solo, 'cause I'm afraid to commit
Now can you tell me how I'm different than him, and him, and him?
Yeah, I know I'm always questionin' things, like, girl
Would you say that love cannot be found inside a vow or a ring?
She laughs and says, ""Only material things""
Those are material things, imagine buyin' all my trust with a ring
Imagine spendin' all my love on a fling, got a thing for you
If I had the talent you had, I probably would sing for you, like

I need you to come get me
Out of my head, and into your arms tonight
Tonight (yeah)

[Verse 2: Witt Lowry]
I don't mean to make you wait, or to contemplate about us
My ex, she loved to lie, guess that's why it's harder to trust
I been searchin' to find myself and not get too lost into lust
I heard once that you can try but can't fill from an empty cup
That's no lie, and all I ever say is how I need time
If it was up to you now, you would be mine
I'm on the road more than I'm home and still I find it's only you on my mind
The last three were Gemini, I take that shit as a sign, it's funny
You can't buy time with your money
And you love goin' to the beach whether it's cloudy or sunny
And you love drinkin' all your wine until it hurts in your tummy
You call me, ""Honey, I'm tipsy, and really all I want is for you to love me""
Flashbacks to backroads drivin' back to my side of state
I know I need to tell you I care before it's too late
Before someone steps to the plate, before you decide not to wait
Before you decide not to chase, then you call me up, just to say

I'm out of my head, out of my mind, oh, I

390,"Indo Smoke (From ""Poetic Justice"")","                                      MADAME SWANN AT HOME

A BREAK IN THE NARRATIVE: OLD FRIENDS IN NEW ASPECTS — THE MARQUIS DE NORPOIS — BERGOTTE — HOW I CEASE FOR THE TIME BEING TO SEE GILBERTE: A GENERAL OUTLINE OF THE SORROW CAUSED BY A PARTING AND OF THE IRREGULAR PROCESS OF OBLIVION

    My mother, when it was a question of our having M. de Norpois to dinner for the first time, having expressed her regret that Professor Cottard was away from home, and that she herself had quite ceased to see anything of Swann, since either of these might have helped to entertain the old Ambassador, my father replied that so eminent a guest, so distinguished a man of science as Cottard could never be out of place at a dinner-table, but that Swann, with his ostentation, his habit of crying aloud from the housetops the name of everyone that he knew, however slightly, was an impossible vulgarian whom the Marquis de Norpois would be sure to dismiss as — to use his own epithet — a ‘pestilent’ fellow. Now, this attitude on my father’s part may be felt to require a few words of explanation, inasmuch as some of us, no doubt, remember a Cottard of distinct mediocrity and a Swann by whom modesty and discretion, in all his social relations, were carried to the utmost refinement of delicacy. But in his case, what had happened was that, to the original ‘young Swann’ and also to the Swann of the Jockey Club, our old friend had added a fresh personality (which was not to be his last), that of Odette’s husband. Adapting to the humble ambitions of that lady the instinct, the desire, the industry which he had always had, he had laboriously constructed for himself, a long way beneath the old, a new position more appropriate to the companion who was to share it with him. In this he shewed himself another man. Since (while he continued to go, by himself, to the houses of his own friends, on whom he did not care to inflict Odette unless they had expressly asked that she should be introduced to them) it was a new life that he had begun to lead, in common with his wife, among a new set of people, it was quite intelligible that, in order to estimate the importance of these new friends and thereby the pleasure, the self-esteem that were to be derived from entertaining them, he should have made use, as a standard of comparison, not of the brilliant society in which he himself had moved before his marriage but of the earlier environment of Odette. And yet, even when one knew that it was with unfashionable officials and their faded wives, the wallflowers of ministerial ball-rooms, that he was now anxious to associate, it was still astonishing to hear him, who in the old days, and even still, would so gracefully refrain from mentioning an invitation to Twickenham or to Marlborough House, proclaim with quite unnecessary emphasis that the wife of some Assistant Under-Secretary for Something had returned Mme. Swann’s call. It will perhaps be objected here that what this really implied was that the simplicity of the fashionable Swann had been nothing more than a supreme refinement of vanity, and that, like certain other Israelites, my parents’ old friend had contrived to illustrate in turn all the stages through which his race had passed, from the crudest and coarsest form of snobbishness up to the highest pitch of good manners. But the chief reason — and one which is applicable to humanity as a whole — was that our virtues themselves are not free and floating qualities over which we retain a permanent control and power of disposal; they come to be so closely linked in our minds with the actions in conjunction with which we make it our duty to practise them, that, if we are suddenly called upon to perform some action of a different order, it takes us by surprise, and without our supposing for a moment that it might involve the bringing of those very same virtues into play. Swann, in his intense consciousness of his new social surroundings, and in the pride with which he referred to them, was like those great artists — modest or generous by nature — who, if at the end of their career they take to cooking or to gardening, display a childlike gratification at the compliments that are paid to their dishes or their borders, and will not listen to any of the criticism which they heard unmoved when it was applied to their real achievements; or who, after giving away a canvas, cannot conceal their annoyance if they lose a couple of francs at dominoes

    As for Professor Cottard, we shall meet him again and can study him at our leisure, much later in the course of our story, with the ‘Mistress,’ Mme. Verdurin, in her country house La Raspelière. For the present, the following observations must suffice; first of all, in the case of Swann the alteration might indeed be surprising, since it had been accomplished and yet was not suspected by me when I used to see Gilberte’s father in the Champs-Elysées, where, moreover, as he never spoke to me, he could not very well have made any display of his political relations. It is true that, if he had done so, I might not at once have discerned his vanity, for the idea that one has long held of a person is apt to stop one’s eyes and ears; my mother, for three whole years, had no more noticed the salve with which one of her nieces used to paint her lips than if it had been wholly and invisibly dissolved in some clear liquid; until one day a streak too much, or possibly something else, brought about the phenomenon known as super-saturation; all the paint that had hitherto passed unperceived was now crystallised, and my mother, in the face of this sudden riot of colour, declared, in the best Combray manner, that it was a perfect scandal, and almost severed relations with her niece. With Cottard, on the contrary, the epoch in which we have seen him assisting at the first introduction of Swann to the Verdurins was now buried in the past; whereas honours, offices and titles come with the passage of years; moreover, a man may be illiterate, and make stupid puns, and yet have a special gift, which no amount of general culture can replace — such as the gift of a great strategist or physician. And so it was not merely as an obscure practitioner, who had attained in course of time to European celebrity, that the rest of his profession regarded Cottard. The most intelligent of the younger doctors used to assert — for a year or two, that is to say, for fashions, being themselves begotten of the desire for change, are quick to change also — that if they themselves ever fell ill Cottard was the only one of the leading men to whom they would entrust their lives. No doubt they preferred, socially, to meet certain others who were better read, more artistic, with whom they could discuss Nietzsche and Wagner. When there was a musical party at Mme. Cottard’s, on the evenings when she entertained — in the hope that it might one day make him Dean of the Faculty — the colleagues and pupils of her husband, he, instead of listening, preferred to play cards in another room. Yet everybody praised the quickness, the penetration, the unerring confidence with which, at a glance, he could diagnose disease. Thirdly, in considering the general impression which Professor Cottard must have made on a man like my father, we must bear in mind that the character which a man exhibits in the latter half of his life is not always, even if it is often his original character developed or withered, attenuated or enlarged; it is sometimes the exact opposite, like a garment that has been turned. Except from the Verdurins, who were infatuated with him, Cottard’s hesitating manner, his excessive timidity and affability had, in his young days, called down upon him endless taunts and sneers. What charitable friend counselled that glacial air? The importance of his professional standing made it all the more easy to adopt. Wherever he went, save at the Verdurins’, where he instinctively became himself again, he would assume a repellent coldness, remain silent as long as possible, be peremptory when he was obliged to speak, and not forget to say the most cutting things. He had every opportunity of rehearsing this new attitude before his patients, who, seeing him for the first time, were not in a position to make comparisons, and would have been greatly surprised to learn that he was not at all a rude man by nature. Complete impassivity was what he strove to attain, and even while visiting his hospital wards, when he allowed himself to utter one of those puns which left everyone, from the house physician to the junior student, helpless with laughter, he would always make it without moving a muscle of his face, while even that was no longer recognisable now that he had shaved off his beard and moustache

    But who, the reader has been asking, was the Marquis de Norpois? Well, he had been Minister Plenipotentiary before the War, and was actually an Ambassador on the Sixteenth of May; in spite of which, and to the general astonishment, he had since been several times chosen to represent France on Extraordinary Missions — even as Controller of the Public Debt in Egypt, where, thanks to his great capability as a financier, he had rendered important services — by Radical Cabinets under which a reactionary of the middle classes would have declined to serve, and in whose eyes M. de Norpois, in view of his past, his connexions and his opinions, ought presumably to have been suspect. But these advanced Ministers seemed to consider that, in making such an appointment, they were shewing how broad their own minds were, when the supreme interests of France were at stake, were raising themselves above the general run of politicians, were meriting, from the Journal des Débats itself, the title of ‘Statesmen,’ and were reaping direct advantage from the weight that attaches to an aristocratic name and the dramatic interest always aroused by an unexpected appointment. And they knew also that they could reap these advantages by making an appeal to M. de Norpois, without having to fear any want of political loyalty on his part, a fault against which his noble birth not only need not put them on their guard but offered a positive guarantee. And in this calculation the Government of the Republic were not mistaken. In the first place, because an aristocrat of a certain type, brought up from his cradle to regard his name as an integral part of himself of which no accident can deprive him (an asset of whose value his peers, or persons of even higher rank, can form a fairly exact estimate), knows that he can dispense with the efforts (since they can in no way enhance his position) in which, without any appreciable result, so many public men of the middle class spend themselves — to profess only the ‘right’ opinions, to frequent only the ‘sound’ people. Anxious, on the other hand, to increase his own importance in the eyes of the princely or ducal families which take immediate precedence of his own, he knows that he can do so by giving his name that complement which hitherto it has lacked, which will give it priority over other names heraldically its equals: such as political power, a literary or an artistic reputation, or a large fortune. And so what he saves by avoiding the society of the ineffective country squires, after whom all the professional families run helter-skelter, but of his intimacy with whom, were he to profess it, a prince would think nothing, he will lavish on the politicians who (free-masons, or worse, though they be) can advance him in Diplomacy or ‘back’ him in an election, and on the artists or scientists whose patronage can help him to ‘arrive’ in those departments in which they excel, on everyone, in fact, who is in a position to confer a fresh distinction or to ‘bring off’ a rich marriage

    But in the character of M. de Norpois there was this predominant feature, that, in the course of a long career of diplomacy, he had become imbued with that negative, methodical, conservative spirit, called ‘governmental,’ which is common to all Governments and, under every Government, particularly inspires its Foreign Office. He had imbibed, during that career, an aversion, a dread, a contempt for the methods of procedure, more or less revolutionary and in any event quite incorrect, which are those of an Opposition. Save in the case of a few illiterates — high or low, it makes no matter — by whom no difference in quality is perceptible, what attracts men one to another is not a common point of view but a consanguinity of spirit. An Academician of the kind of Legouvé, and therefore an upholder of the classics, would applaud Maxime Ducamp’s or Mezière’s eulogy of Victor Hugo with more fervour than that of Boileau by Claudel. A common Nationalism suffices to endear Barrés to his electors, who scarcely distinguish between him and M. Georges Berry, but does not endear him to those of his brother Academicians who, with a similar outlook on politics but a different type of mind, will prefer to him even such open adversaries as M. Ribot and M. Deschanel, with whom, in turn, the most loyal Monarchists feel themselves more closely allied than with Maurras or Léon Daudet, although these also are living in the hope of a glorious Restoration. Miserly in the use of words, not only from a professional scruple of prudence and reserve, but because words themselves have more value, present more subtleties of definition to men whose efforts, protracted over a decade, to bring two countries to an understanding, are condensed, translated — in a speech or in a protocol — into a single adjective, colourless in all appearance, but to them pregnant with a world of meaning, M. de Norpois was considered very stiff, at the Commission, where he sat next to my father, whom everyone else congratulated on the astonishing way in which the old Ambassador unbent to him. My father was himself more astonished than anyone. For not being, as a rule, very affable, his company was little sought outside his own intimate circle, a limitation which he used modestly and frankly to avow. He realised that these overtures were an outcome, in the diplomat, of that point of view which everyone adopts for himself in making his choice of friends, from which all a man’s intellectual qualities, his refinement, his affection are a far less potent recommendation of him, when at the same time he bores or irritates one, than are the mere straightforwardness and good-humour of another man whom most people would regard as frivolous or even fatuous. “De Norpois has asked me to dinner again; it’s quite extraordinary; everyone on the Commission is amazed, as he never has any personal relations with any of us. I am sure he’s going to tell me something thrilling, again, about the ‘Seventy war.” My father knew that M. de Norpois had warned, had perhaps been alone in warning the Emperor of the growing strength and bellicose designs of Prussia, and that Bismarck rated his intelligence most highly. Only the other day, at the Opera, during the gala performance given for King Theodosius, the newspapers had all drawn attention to the long conversation which that Monarch had held with M. de Norpois. “I must ask him whether the King’s visit had any real significance,” my father went on, for he was keenly interested in foreign politics. “I know old Norpois keeps very close as a rule, but when he’s with me he opens out quite charmingly.”

    As for my mother, perhaps the Ambassador had not the type of mind towards which she felt herself most attracted. I should add that his conversation furnished so exhaustive a glossary of the superannuated forms of speech peculiar to a certain profession, class and period — a period which, for that profession and that class, might be said not to have altogether passed away — that I sometimes regret that I have not kept any literal record simply of the things that I have heard him say. I should thus have obtained an effect of old-fashioned courtesy by the same process and at as little expense as that actor at the Palais-Royal who, when asked where on earth he managed to find his astounding hats, answered, “I do not find my hats. I keep them.” In a word, I suppose that my mother considered M. de Norpois a trifle ‘out-of-date,’ which was by no means a fault in her eyes, so far as manners were concerned, but attracted her less in the region — not, in this instance, of ideas, for those of M. de Norpois were extremely modern — but of idiom. She felt, however, that she was paying a delicate compliment to her husband when she spoke admiringly of the diplomat who had shewn so remarkable a predilection for him. By confirming in my father’s mind the good opinion that he already had of M. de Norpois, and so inducing him to form a good opinion of himself also, she knew that she was carrying out that one of her wifely duties which consisted in making life pleasant and comfortable for her husband, just as when she saw to it that his dinner was perfectly cooked and served in silence. And as she was incapable of deceiving my father, she compelled herself to admire the old Ambassador, so as to be able to praise him with sincerity. Incidentally she could naturally, and did, appreciate his kindness, his somewhat antiquated courtesy (so ceremonious that when, as he was walking along the street, his tall figure rigidly erect, he caught sight of my mother driving past, before raising his hat to her he would fling away the cigar that he had just lighted); his conversation, so elaborately circumspect, in which he referred as seldom as possible to himself and always considered what might interest the person to whom he was speaking; his promptness in answering a letter, which was so astonishing that whenever my father, just after posting one himself to M. de Norpois, saw his handwriting upon an envelope, his first thought was always one of annoyance that their letters must, unfortunately, have crossed in the post; which, one was led to suppose, bestowed upon him the special and luxurious privilege of extraordinary deliveries and collections at all hours of the day and night. My mother marvelled at his being so punctilious although so busy, so friendly although so much in demand, never realising that ‘although,’ with such people, is invariably an unrecognised ‘because,’ and that (just as old men are always wonderful for their age, and kings extraordinarily simple, and country cousins astonishingly well-informed) it was the same system of habits that enabled M. de Norpois to undertake so many duties and to be so methodical in answering letters, to go everywhere and to be so friendly when he came to us. Moreover she made the mistake which everyone makes who is unduly modest; she rated everything that concerned herself below, and consequently outside the range of, other people’s duties and engagements. The letter which it seemed to her so meritorious in my father’s friend to have written us promptly, since in the course of the day he must have had ever so many letters to write, she excepted from that great number of letters, of which actually it was a unit; in the same way she did not consider that dining with us was, for M. de Norpois, merely one of the innumerable activities of his social life; she never guessed that the Ambassador had trained himself, long ago, to look upon dining-out as one of his diplomatic functions, and to display, at table, an inveterate charm which it would have been too much to have expected him specially to discard when he came to dine with us

    The evening on which M. de Norpois first appeared at our table, in a year when I still went to play in the Champs-Elysées, has remained fixed in my memory because the afternoon of the same day was that upon which I at last went to hear Berma, at a matinée, in Phèdre, and also because in talking to M. de Norpois I realised suddenly, and in a new and different way, how completely the feelings aroused in me by all that concerned Gilberte Swann and her parents differed from any that the same family could inspire in anyone else

    It was no doubt the sight of the depression in which I was plunged by the approach of the New Year holidays, in which, as she herself had informed me, I was to see nothing of Gilberte, that prompted my mother one day, in the hope of distracting my mind, to suggest, “If you are still so anxious to hear Berma, I think that your father would allow you perhaps to go; your grandmother can take you.”

    But it was because M. de Norpois had told him that he ought to let me hear Berma, that it was an experience for a young man to remember in later life, that my father, who had hitherto been so resolutely opposed to my going and wasting my time, with the added risk of my falling ill again, on what he used to shock my grandmother by calling ‘futilities,’ was now not far from regarding this manner of spending an afternoon as included, in some vague way, in the list of precious formulae for success in a brilliant career. My grandmother, who, in renouncing on my behalf the profit which, according to her, I should have derived from hearing Berma, had made a considerable sacrifice in the interests of my health, was surprised to find that this last had become of no account at a mere word from M. de Norpois. Reposing the unconquerable hopes of her rationalist spirit in the strict course of fresh air and early hours which had been prescribed for me, she now deplored, as something disastrous, this infringement that I was to make of my rules, and in a tone of despair protested, “How easily led you are!” to my father, who replied angrily “What! So it’s you that are not for letting him go, now. That is really too much, after your telling us all day and every day that it would be so good for him.”

    M. de Norpois had also brought about a change in my father’s plans in a matter of far greater importance to myself. My father had always meant me to become a diplomat, and I could not endure the thought that, even if I did have to stay for some years, first, at the Ministry, I should run the risk of being sent, later on, as Ambassador, to capitals in which no Gilberte dwelt. I should have preferred to return to the literary career that I had planned for myself, and had been abandoned, years before, in my wanderings along the Guermantes way. But my father had steadily opposed my devoting myself to literature, which he regarded as vastly inferior to diplomacy, refusing even to dignify it with the title of career, until the day when M. de Norpois, who had little love for the more recent generations of diplomatic agents, assured him that it was quite possible, by writing, to attract as much attention, to receive as much consideration, to exercise as much influence, and at the same time to preserve more independence than in the Embassies

    “Well, well, I should never have believed it. Old Norpois doesn’t at all disapprove of your idea of taking up writing,” my father had reported. And as he had a certain amount of influence himself, he imagined that there was nothing that could not be ‘arranged,’ no problem for which a happy solution might not be found in the conversation of people who ‘counted.’ “I shall bring him back to dinner, one of these days, from the Commission. You must talk to him a little, and let him see what he thinks of you. Write something good that you can shew him; he is an intimate friend of the editor of the Deux-Mondes; he will get you in there; he will arrange it all, the cunning old fox; and, upon my soul, he seems to think that diplomacy, nowadays ——!”

    My happiness in the prospect of not being separated from Gilberte made me desirous, but not capable, of writing something good which could be shewn to M. de Norpois. After a few laboured pages, weariness made the pen drop from my fingers; I cried with anger at the thought that I should never have any talent, that I was not ‘gifted,’ that I could not even take advantage of the chance that M. de Norpois’s coming visit was to offer me of spending the rest of my life in Paris. The recollection that I was to be taken to hear Berma alone distracted me from my grief. But just as I did not wish to see any storms except on those coasts where they raged with most violence, so I should not have cared to hear the great actress except in one of those classic parts in which Swann had told me that she touched the sublime. For when it is in the hope of making a priceless discovery that we desire to receive certain impressions from nature or from works of art, we have certain scruples about allowing our soul to gather, instead of these, other, inferior, impressions, which are liable to make us form a false estimate of the value of Beauty. Berma in Andromaque, in Les Caprices de Marianne, in Phèdre, was one of those famous spectacles which my imagination had so long desired. I should enjoy the same rapture as on the day when in a gondola I glided to the foot of the Titian of the Frari or the Carpaccios of San Giorgio dei Schiavoni, were I ever to hear Berma repeat the lines beginning

                         “On dit qu’un prompt départ vous éloigne de
                                 nous, Seigneur — —”

    I was familiar with them from the simple reproduction in black and white which was given of them upon the printed page; but my heart beat furiously at the thought — as of the realisation of a long-planned voyage — that I should at length behold them, bathed and brought to life in the atmosphere and sunshine of the voice of gold. A Carpaccio in Venice, Berma in Phèdre, masterpieces of pictorial or dramatic art which the glamour, the dignity attaching to them made so living to me, that is to say so indivisible, that if I had been taken to see Carpaccios in one of the galleries of the Louvre, or Berma in some piece of which I had never heard, I should not have experienced the same delicious amazement at finding myself at length, with wide-open eyes, before the unique and inconceivable object of so many thousand dreams. Then, while I waited, expecting to derive from Berma’s playing the revelation of certain aspects of nobility and tragic grief, it would seem to me that whatever greatness, whatever truth there might be in her playing must be enhanced if the actress imposed it upon a work of real value, instead of what would, after all, be but embroidering a pattern of truth and beauty upon a commonplace and vulgar web

    Finally, if I went to hear Berma in a new piece, it would not be easy for me to judge of her art, of her diction, since I should not be able to differentiate between a text which was not already familiar and what she added to it by her intonations and gestures, an addition which would seem to me to be embodied in the play itself; whereas the old plays, the classics which I knew by heart, presented themselves to me as vast and empty walls, reserved and made ready for my inspection, on which I should be able to appreciate without restriction the devices by which Berma would cover them, as with frescoes, with the perpetually fresh treasures of her inspiration. Unfortunately, for some years now, since she had retired from the great theatres, to make the fortune of one on the boulevards where she was the ‘star,’ she had ceased to appear in classic parts; and in vain did I scan the hoardings; they never advertised any but the newest pieces, written specially for her by authors in fashion at the moment. When, one morning, as I stood searching the column of announcements to find the afternoon performances for the week of the New Year holidays, I saw there for the first time — at the foot of the bill, after some probably insignificant curtain-raiser, whose title was opaque to me because it had latent in it all the details of an action of which I was ignorant — two acts ofPhèdre with Mme. Berma, and, on the following afternoons, Le Demi-Monde, Les Caprices de Marianne, names which, like that of Phèdre, were for me transparent, filled with light only, so familiar were those works to me, illuminated to their very depths by the revealing smile of art. They seemed to me to invest with a fresh nobility Mme. Berma herself when I read in the newspapers, after the programme of these performances, that it was she who had decided to shew herself once more to the public in some of her early creations. She was conscious, then, that certain stage-parts have an interest which survives the novelty of their first production or the success of a revival; she regarded them, when interpreted by herself, as museum pieces which it might be instructive to set before the eyes of the generation which had admired her in them long ago, or of that which had never yet seen her in them. In thus advertising, in the middle of a column of plays intended only to while away an evening, this Phèdre, a title no longer than any of the rest, nor set in different type, she added something indescribable, as though a hostess, introducing you, before you all go in to dinner, to her other guests, were to mention, casually, amid the string of names which are the names of guests and nothing more, and without any change of tone:—“M. Anatole France.”

    The doctor who was attending me — the same who had forbidden me to travel — advised my parents not to let me go to the theatre; I should only be ill again afterwards, perhaps for weeks, and should in the long run derive more pain than pleasure from the experience. The fear of this might have availed to stop me, if what I had anticipated from such a spectacle had been only a pleasure for which a subsequent pain could so compensate as to cancel it. But what I demanded from this performance — just as from the visit to Balbec, the visit to Venice for which I had so intensely longed — was something quite different from pleasure; a series of verities pertaining to a world more real than that in which I lived, which, once acquired, could never be taken from me again by any of the trivial incidents — even though it were the cause of bodily suffering — of my otiose existence. At best, the pleasure which I was to feel during the performance appeared to me as the perhaps inevitable form of the perception of these truths; and I hoped only that the illness which had been forecast for me would not begin until the play was finished, so that my pleasure should not be in any way compromised or spoiled. I implored my parents, who, after the doctor’s visit, were no longer inclined to let me go to Phèdre. I repeated, all day long, to myself, the speech beginning

                   “On dit qu’un prompt départ vous éloigne de nous                                    — —”

    seeking out every intonation that could be put into it, so as to be able better to measure my surprise at the way which Berma would have found of uttering the lines. Concealed, like the Holy of Holies, beneath the veil that screened her from my gaze, behind which I invested her, every moment, with a fresh aspect, according to which of the words of Bergotte — in the pamphlet that Gilberte had found for me — was passing through my mind; “plastic nobility,” “Christian austerity” or “Jansenist pallor,” “Princess of Troezen and of Cleves” or “Mycenean drama,” “Delphic symbol,” “Solar myth”; that divine Beauty, whom Berma’s acting was to reveal to me, night and day, upon an altar perpetually illumined, sat enthroned hi the sanctuary of my mind, my mind for which not itself but my stern, my fickle parents were to decide whether or not it was to enshrine, and for all time, the perfections of the Deity unveiled, in the same spot where was now her invisible form. And with my eyes fixed upon that inconceivable image, I strove from morning to night to overcome the barriers which my family were putting in my way. But when those had at last fallen, when my mother — albeit this matinée was actually to coincide with the meeting of the Commission from which my father had promised to bring M. de Norpois home to dinner — had said to me, “Very well, we don’t wish you to be unhappy; — if you think that you will enjoy it so very much, you must go; that’s all;” when this day of theatre-going, hitherto forbidden and unattainable, depended now only upon myself, then for the first time, being no longer troubled by the wish that it might cease to be impossible, I asked myself if it were desirable, if there were not other reasons than my parents’ prohibition which should make me abandon my design. In the first place, whereas I had been detesting them for their cruelty, their consent made them now so dear to me that the thought of causing them pain stabbed me also with a pain through which the purpose of life shewed itself as the pursuit not of truth but of loving-kindness, and life itself seemed good or evil only as my parents were happy or sad. “I would rather not go, if it hurts you,” I told my mother, who, on the contrary, strove hard to expel from my mind any lurking fear that she might regret my going, since that, she said, would spoil the pleasure that I should otherwise derive fromPhèdre, and it was the thought of my pleasure that had induced my father and her to reverse their earlier decision. But then this sort of obligation to find a pleasure in the performance seemed to me very burdensome. Besides, if I returned home ill, should I be well again in time to be able to go to the Champs-Elysées as soon as the holidays were over and Gilberte returned? Against all these arguments I set, so as to decide which course I should take, the idea, invisible there behind its veil, of the perfections of Berma. I cast into one pan of the scales “Making Mamma unhappy,” “risking not being able to go on the Champs-Elysées,” and the other, “Jansenist pallor,” “Solar myth,” until the words themselves grew dark and clouded in my mind’s vision, ceased to say anything to me, lost all their force; and gradually my hesitations became so painful that if I had now decided upon the theatre it would have been only that I might bring them to an end, and be delivered from them once and for all. It would have been to fix a term to my sufferings, and no longer in the expectation of an intellectual benediction, yielding to the attractions of perfection, that I would let myself be taken, not now to the Wise Goddess, but to the stern, implacable Divinity, featureless and unnamed, who had been secretly substituted for her behind the veil. But suddenly everything was altered. My desire to go and hear Berma received a fresh stimulus which enabled me to await the coming of the matinée with impatience and with joy; having gone to take up, in front of the column on which the playbills were, my daily station, as excruciating, of late, as that of a stylite saint, I had seen there, still moist and wrinkled, the complete bill of Phèdre, which had just been pasted up for the first time (and on which, I must confess, the rest of the cast furnished no additional attraction which could help me to decide). But it gave to one of the points between which my indecision wavered a form at once more concrete and — inasmuch as the bill was dated not from the day on which I read it but from that on which the performance would take place, and from the very hour at which the curtain would rise — almost imminent, well on the way, already, to its realisation, so that I jumped for joy before the column at the thought that on that day, and at that hour precisely, I should be sitting there in my place, ready to hear the voice of Berma; and for fear lest my parents might not now be in time to secure two good seats for my grandmother and myself, I raced back to the house, whipped on by the magic words which had now taken the place, in my mind, of “Jansenist pallor” and “Solar myth”; —“Ladies will not be admitted to the stalls in hats. The doors will be closed at two o’clock.”

    Alas! that first matinée was to prove a bitter disappointment. My father offered to drop my grandmother and me at the theatre, on his way to the Commission. Before leaving the house he said to my mother: “See that you have a good dinner for us to-night; you remember, I’m bringing de Norpois back with me.” My mother had not forgotten. And all that day, and overnight, Françoise, rejoicing in the opportunity to devote herself to that art of the kitchen — of which she was indeed a past-master, stimulated, moreover, by the prospect of having a new guest to feed, the consciousness that she would have to compose, by methods known to her alone, a dish of beef in jelly — had been living in the effervescence of creation; since she attached the utmost importance to the intrinsic quality of the materials which were to enter into the fabric of her work, she had gone herself to the Halles to procure the best cuts of rump-steak, shin of beef, calves’-feet, as Michelangelo passed eight months in the mountains of Carrara choosing the most perfect blocks of marble for the monument of Julius II— Françoise expended on these comings and goings so much ardour that Mamma, at the sight of her flaming cheeks, was alarmed lest our old servant should make herself ill with overwork, like the sculptor of the Tombs of the Medici in the quarries of Pietrasanta. And overnight Françoise had sent to be cooked in the baker’s oven, shielded with breadcrumbs, like a block of pink marble packed in sawdust, what she called a “Nev’-York ham.” Believing the language to be less rich than it actually was in words, and her own ears less trustworthy, the first time that she heard anyone mention York ham she had thought, no doubt — feeling it to be hardly conceivable that the dictionary could be so prodigal as to include at once a ‘York’ and a ‘New York’— that she had misheard what was said, and that the ham was really called by the name already familiar to her. And so, ever since, the word York was preceded in her ears, or before her eyes when she read it in an advertisement, by the affix ‘New’ which she pronounced ‘Nev’.’ And it was with the most perfect faith that she would say to her kitchen-maid: “Go and fetch me a ham from Olida’s. Madame told me especially to get a Nev’-York.” On that particular day, if Françoise was consumed by the burning certainty of creative genius, my lot was the cruel anxiety of the seeker after truth. No doubt, so long as I had not yet heard Berma speak, I still felt some pleasure. I felt it in the little square that lay in front of the theatre, in which, in two hours’ time, the bare boughs of the chestnut trees would gleam with a metallic lustre as the lighted gas-lamps shewed up every detail of their structure; before the attendants in the box-office, the selection of whom, their promotion, all their destiny depended upon the great artist — for she alone held power in the theatre, where ephemeral managers followed one after the other in an obscure succession — who took our tickets without even glancing at us, so preoccupied were they with their anxiety lest any of Mme. Berma’s instructions had not been duly transmitted to the new members of the staff, lest it was not clearly, everywhere, understood that the hired applause must never sound for her, that the windows must all be kept open so long as she was not on the stage, and every door closed tight, the moment that she appeared; that a bowl of hot water must be concealed somewhere close to her, to make the dust settle: and, for that matter, at any moment now her carriage, drawn by a pair of horses with flowing manes, would be stopping outside the theatre, she would alight from it muffled in furs, and, crossly acknowledging everyone’s salute, would send one of her attendants to find out whether a stage box had been kept for her friends, what the temperature was ‘in front,’ who were in the other boxes, if the programme sellers were looking smart; theatre and public being to her no more than a second, an outermost cloak which she would put on, and the medium, the more or less ‘good’ conductor through which her talent would have to pass. I was happy, too, in the theatre itself; since I had made the discovery that — in contradiction of the picture so long entertained by my childish imagination — there was but one stage for everybody, I had supposed that I should be prevented from seeing it properly by the presence of the other spectators, as one is when in the thick of a crowd; now I registered the fact that, on the contrary, thanks to an arrangement which is, so to speak, symbolical of all spectatorship, everyone feels himself to be the centre of the theatre; which explained to me why, when Françoise had been sent once to see some melodrama from the top gallery, she had assured us on her return that her seat had been the best in the house, and that instead of finding herself too far from the stage she had been positively frightened by the mysterious and living proximity of the curtain. My pleasure increased further when I began to distinguish behind the said lowered curtain such confused rappings as one hears through the shell of an egg before the chicken emerges, sounds which speedily grew louder and suddenly, from that world which, impenetrable by our eyes, yet scrutinised us with its own, addressed themselves, and to us indubitably, in the imperious form of three consecutive hammer-blows as moving as any signals from the planet Mars. And — once this curtain had risen — when on the stage a writing-table and a fireplace, in no way out of the ordinary, had indicated that the persons who were about to enter would be, not actors come to recite, as I had seen them once and heard them at an evening party, but real people, just living their lives at home, on whom I was thus able to spy without their seeing me — my pleasure still endured; it was broken by a momentary uneasiness; just as I was straining my ears in readiness before the piece began, two men entered the theatre from the side of the stage, who must have been very angry with each other, for they were talking so loud that in the auditorium, where there were at least a thousand people, we could hear every word, whereas in quite a small café one is obliged to call the waiter and ask what it is that two men, who appear to be quarrelling, are saying; but at that moment, while I sat astonished to find that the audience was listening to them without protest, drowned as it was in a universal silence upon which broke, presently, a laugh here and there, I understood that these insolent fellows were the actors and that the short piece known as the ‘curtain-raiser’ had now begun. It was followed by an interval so long that the audience, who had returned to their places, grew impatient and began to stamp their feet. I was terrified at this; for just as in the report of a criminal trial, when I read that some noble-minded person was coming, against his own interests, to testify on behalf of an innocent prisoner, I was always afraid that they would not be nice enough to him, would not shew enough gratitude, would not recompense him lavishly, and that he, in disgust, would then range himself on the side of injustice; so now attributing to genius, in this respect, the same qualities as to virtue, I was afraid lest Berma, annoyed by the bad behaviour of so ill-bred an audience — in which, on the other hand, I should have liked her to recognise, with satisfaction, a few celebrities to whose judgment she would be bound to attach importance — should express her discontent and disdain by acting badly. And I gazed appealingly round me at these stamping brutes who were about to shatter, in their insensate rage, the rare and fragile impression which I had come to seek. The last moments of my pleasure were during the opening scenes of Phèdre. The heroine herself does not appear in these first scenes of the second act; and yet, as soon as the curtain rose, and another curtain, of red velvet this time, was parted in the middle (a curtain which was used to halve the depth of the stage in all the plays in which the ‘star’ appeared), an actress entered from the back who had the face and voice which, I had been told, were those of Berma. The cast must therefore have been changed; all the trouble that I had taken in studying the part of the wife of Theseus was wasted. But a second actress now responded to the first. I must, then, have been mistaken in supposing that the first was Berma, for the second even more closely resembled her, and, more than the other, had her diction. Both of them, moreover, enriched their parts with noble gestures — which I could vividly distinguish, and could appreciate in their relation to the text, while they raised and let fall the lovely folds of their tunics — and also with skilful changes of tone, now passionate, now ironical, which made me realise the significance of lines that I had read to myself at home without paying sufficient attention to what they really meant. But all of a sudden, in the cleft of the red curtain that veiled her sanctuary, as in a frame, appeared a woman, and simultaneously with the fear that seized me, far more vexing than Berma’s fear could be, lest someone should upset her by opening a window, or drown one of her lines by rustling a programme, or annoy her by applauding the others and by not applauding her enough; — in my own fashion, still more absolute than Berma’s, of considering from that moment theatre, audience, play and my own body only as an acoustic medium of no importance, save in the degree to which it was favourable to the inflexions of that voice — I realised that the two actresses whom I had been for some minutes admiring bore not the least resemblance to her whom I had come to hear. But at the same time all my pleasure had ceased; in vain might I strain towards Berma’s eyes, ears, mind, so as not to let one morsel escape me of the reasons which she would furnish for my admiring her, I did not succeed in gathering a single one. I could not even, as I could with her companions, distinguish in her diction and in her playing intelligent intonations, beautiful gestures. I listened to her as though I were readingPhèdre, or as though Phaedra herself had at that moment uttered the words that I was hearing, without its appearing that Berma’s talent had added anything at all to them. I could have wished, so as to be able to explore them fully, so as to attempt to discover what it was in them that was beautiful, to arrest, to immobilise for a time before my senses every intonation of the artist’s voice, every expression of her features; at least I did attempt, by dint of my mental agility in having, before a line came, my attention ready and tuned to catch it, not to waste upon preparations any morsel of the precious time that each word, each gesture occupied, and, thanks to the intensity of my observation, to manage to penetrate as far into them as if I had had whole hours to spend upon them, by myself. But how short their duration was! Scarcely had a sound been received by my ear than it was displaced there by another. In one scene, where Berma stands motionless for a moment, her arm raised to the level of a face bathed, by some piece of stagecraft, in a greenish light, before a back-cloth painted to represent the sea, the whole house broke out in applause; but already the actress had moved, and the picture that I should have liked to study existed no longer. I told my grandmother that I could not see very well; she handed me her glasses. Only, when one believes in the reality of a thing, making it visible by artificial means is not quite the same as feeling that it is close at hand. I thought now that it was no longer Berma at whom I was looking, but her image in a magnifying glass. I put the glasses down, but then possibly the image that my eye received of her, diminished by distance, was no more exact; which of the two Bermas was the real? As for her speech to Hippolyte, I had counted enormously upon that, since, to judge by the ingenious significance which her companions were disclosing to me at every moment in less beautiful parts, she would certainly render it with intonations more surprising than any which, when reading the play at home, I had contrived to imagine; but she did not attain to the heights which Œnone or Aricie would naturally have reached, she planed down into a uniform flow of melody the whole of a passage in which there were mingled together contradictions so striking that the least intelligent of tragic actresses, even the pupils of an academy, could not have missed their effect; besides which, she ran through the speech so rapidly that it was only when she had come to the last line that my mind became aware of the deliberate monotony which she had imposed on it throughout

    Then, at last, a sense of admiration did possess me, provoked by the frenzied applause of the audience. I mingled my own with theirs, endeavouring to prolong the general sound so that Berma, in her gratitude, should surpass herself, and I be certain of having heard her on one of her great days. A curious thing, by the way, was that the moment when this storm of public enthusiasm broke loose was, as I afterwards learned, that in which Berma reveals one of her richest treasures. It would appear that certain transcendent realities emit all around them a radiance to which the crowd is sensitive. So it is that when any great event occurs, when on a distant frontier an army is in jeopardy, or defeated, or victorious, the vague and conflicting reports which we receive, from which an educated man can derive little enlightenment, stimulate in the crowd an emotion by which that man is surprised, and in which, once expert criticism has informed him of the actual military situation, he recognises the popular perception of that ‘aura’ which surrounds momentous happenings, and which may be visible hundreds of miles away. One learns of a victory either after the war is over, or at once, from the hilarious joy of one’s hall porter. One discovers the touch of genius in Berma’s acting a week after one has heard her, in the criticism of some review, or else on the spot, from the thundering acclamation of the stalls. But this immediate recognition by the crowd was mingled with a hundred others, all quite erroneous; the applause came, most often, at wrong moments, apart from the fact that it was mechanically produced by the effect of the applause that had gone before, just as in a storm, once the sea is sufficiently disturbed, it will continue to swell, even after the wind has begun to subside. No matter; the more I applauded, the better, it seemed to me, did Berma act. “I say,” came from a woman sitting near me, of no great social pretensions, “she fairly gives it you, she does; you’d think she’d do herself an injury, the way she runs about. I call that acting, don’t you?” And happy to find these reasons for Berma’s superiority, though not without a suspicion that they no more accounted for it than would for that of the Gioconda or of Benvenuto’s Perseus a peasant’s gaping “That’s a good bit of work. It’s all gold, look! Fine, ain’t it?”, I greedily imbibed the strong wine of this popular enthusiasm. I felt, all the same, when the curtain had fallen fer the last time, disappointed that the pleasure for which I had so longed had been no greater, but at the same time I felt the need to prolong it, not to depart for ever, when I left the theatre, from this strange life of the stage which had, for a few hours, been my own, from which I should be tearing myself away, as though I were going into exile, when I returned to my; own home, had I not hoped there to learn a great deal more about Berma from her admirer, to whom I was indebted already for the permission to go to Phèdre, M. de Norpois. I was introduced to him before dinner by my father, who summoned me into his study for the purpose. As I entered, the Ambassador rose, held out his hand, bowed his tall figure and fixed his blue eyes attentively on my face. As the foreign visitors who used to be presented to him, in the days when he still represented France abroad, were all more or less (even the famous singers) persons of note, with regard to whom he could tell, when he met them, that he would be able to say, later on, when he heard then — names mentioned in Paris or in Petersburg, that he remembered perfectly the evening he had spent with them at Munich or Sofia, he had formed the habit of impressing upon them, by his affability, the pleasure with which he was making their acquaintance; but in addition to this, being convinced that in the life of European capitals, in contact at once with all the interesting personalities that passed through them and with the manners and customs of the native populations, one acquired a deeper insight than could be gained from books into the intellectual movement throughout Europe, he would exercise upon each newcomer his keen power of observation, so as to decide at once with what manner of man he had to deal. The Government had not for some time now entrusted to him a post abroad, but still, as soon as anyone was introduced to him, his eyes, as though they had not yet been informed of their master’s retirement, began their fruitful observation, while by his whole attitude he endeavoured to convey that the stranger’s name was not unknown to him. And so, all the time, while he spoke to me kindly and with the air of importance of a man who is conscious of the vastness of his own experience, he never ceased to examine me with a sagacious curiosity, and to his own profit, as though I had been some exotic custom, some historic and instruct tive building or some ‘star’ upon his course. And in this way he gave proof at once, in his attitude towards me, of the majestic benevolence of the sage Mentor and of the zealous curiosity of the young Anacharsis

    He offered me absolutely no opening to the Revue des Deux-Mondes, but put a number of questions to me on what I had been doing and reading; asked what were my own inclinations, which I heard thus spoken of for the first time as though it might be a quite reasonable thing to obey their promptings, whereas hitherto I had always supposed it to be my duty to suppress them. Since they attracted me towards Literature, he did not dissuade me from that course; on the contrary, he spoke of it with deference, as of some venerable personage whose select circle, in Rome or at Dresden, one remembers with pleasure, and regrets only that one’s multifarious duties in life enable one to revisit it so seldom. He appeared to be envying me, with an almost jovial smile, the delightful hours which, more fortunate than himself and more free, I should be able to spend with such a Mistress. But the very terms that he employed shewed me Literature as something entirely different from the image that I had formed of it at Combray, and I realised that I had been doubly right in abandoning my intention. Until now, I had reckoned only that I had not the ‘gift’ for writing; now M. de Norpois took from me the ambition also. I wanted to express to him what had been my dreams; trembling with emotion, I was painfully apprehensive that all the words which I could utter would not be the sincerest possible equivalent of what I had felt, what I had never yet attempted to formulate; that is to say that my words had no clear significance. Perhaps by a professional habit, perhaps by virtue of the calm that is acquired by every important personage whose advice is commonly sought, and who, knowing that he will keep the control of the conversation in his own hands, allows the other party to fret, to struggle, to take his time; perhaps also to emphasize the dignity of his head (Greek, according to himself, despite his sweeping whiskers), M. de Norpois, while anything was being explained to him, would preserve a facial immobility as absolute as if you had been addressing some ancient and unhearing bust in a museum. Until suddenly, falling upon you like an auctioneer’s hammer, or a Delphic oracle, the Ambassador’s voice, as he replied to you, would be all the more impressive, in that nothing in his face had allowed you to guess what sort of impression you had made on him, or what opinion he was about to express

    “Precisely;” he suddenly began, as though the case were now heard and judged, and after allowing me to writhe in increasing helplessness beneath those motionless eyes which never for an instant left my face. “There is the case of the son of one of my friends, which, mutatis mutandis, is very much like yours.” He adopted in speaking of our common tendency the same reassuring tone as if it had been a tendency not to literature but to rheumatics, and he had wished to assure me that it would not necessarily prove fatal. “He too has chosen to leave the Quai d’Orsay, although the way had been paved for him there by his father, and without caring what people might say, he has settled down to write. And certainly, he’s had no reason to regret it. He published two years ago — of course, he’s much older than you, you understand — a book dealing with the Sense of the Infinite on the Western Shore of Victoria Nyanza, and this year he has brought out a little thing, not so important as the other, but very brightly, in places perhaps almost too pointedly written, on the Repeating Rifle in the Bulgarian Army; and these have put him quite in a class by himself. He’s gone pretty far already, and he’s not the sort of man to stop half way; I happen to know that (without any suggestion, of course, of his standing for election) his name has been mentioned several times, in conversation, and not at all unfavourably, at the Academy of Moral Sciences. And so, one can’t say yet, of course, that he has reached the pinnacle of fame, still he has made his way, by sheer industry, to a very fine position indeed, and success — which doesn’t always come only to agitators and mischief-makers and men who make trouble which is usually more than they are prepared to take — success has crowned his efforts.”

    My father, seeing me already, in a few years’ time, an Academician, was tasting a contentment which M. de Norpois raised to the supreme pitch when, after a momentary hesitation in which he appeared to be calculating the possible consequences of so rash an act, he handed me his card and said: “Why not go and see him yourself? Tell him I sent you. He may be able to give you some good advice,” plunging me by his words into as painful a state of anxiety as if he had told me that, next morning, I was to embark as cabin-boy on board a sailing ship, and to go round the world

    My Aunt Léonie had bequeathed to me, together with all sorts of other things and much of her furniture, with which it was difficult to know what to do, almost all her unsettled estate — revealing thus after her death an affection for me which I had hardly suspected in her lifetime. My father, who was trustee of this estate until I came of age, now consulted M. de Norpois with regard to several of the investments. He recommended certain stocks bearing a low rate of interest, which he considered particularly sound, notably English consols and Russian four per cents. “With absolutely first class securities such as those,” said M. de Norpois, “even if your income from them is nothing very great, you may be certain of never losing any of your capital.” My father then told him, roughly, what else he had bought. M. de Norpois gave a just perceptible smile of congratulation; like all capitalists, he regarded wealth as an enviable thing, but thought it more delicate to compliment people upon their possessions only by a half-indicated sign of intelligent sympathy; on the other hand, as he was himself immensely rich, he felt that he shewed his good taste by seeming to regard as considerable the meagre revenues of his friends, with a happy and comforting resilience to the superiority of his own. He made amends for this by congratulating my father, without hesitation, on the “composition” of his list of investments, selected “with so sure, so delicate, so fine a taste.” You would have supposed, to hear him, that he attributed to the relative values of investments, and even to investments themselves, something akin to aesthetic merit. Of one, comparatively recent and still little known, which my father mentioned, M. de Norpois, like the people who have always read the books of which, you imagine, you yourself alone have ever heard, said at once, “Ah, yes, I used to amuse myself for some time with watching it in the papers; it was quite interesting,” with the retrospective smile of a regular subscriber who has read the latest novel already, in monthly instalments, in his magazine. “It would not be at all a bad idea to apply for some of this new issue. It is distinctly attractive; they are offering it at a most tempting discount.” But when he came to some of the older investments, my father, who could not remember their exact names, which it was easy to confuse with others of the same kind, opened a drawer and shewed the securities themselves to the Ambassador. The sight of them enchanted me. They were ornamented with cathedral spires and allegorical figures, like the old, romantic editions that I had pored over as a child. All the products of one period have something in common; the artists who illustrate the poetry of their generation are the same artists who are employed by the big financial houses. And nothing reminds me so much of the monthly parts of Notre-Dame de Paris, and of various books by Gérard de Nerval, that used to hang outside the grocer’s door at Combray, than does, in its rectangular and flowery border, supported by recumbent river-gods, a ‘personal share’ in the Water Company

    The contempt which my father had for my kind of intelligence was so far tempered by his natural affection for me that, in practice, his attitude towards anything that I might do was one of blind indulgence. And so he had no qualm about telling me to fetch a little ‘prose poem’ which I had made up, years before, at Combray, while coming home from a walk. I had written it down in a state of exaltation which must, I felt certain, infect everyone who read it. But it was not destined to captivate M. de Norpois, for he handed it back to me without a word

    My mother, who had the most profound respect for all my father’s occupations, came in now, timidly, to ask whether dinner might be served. She was afraid to interrupt a conversation in which she herself could have no part. And indeed my father was continually reminding the Marquis of some useful suggestion which they had decided to make at the next meeting of the Commission; speaking in the peculiar tone always adopted, when in a strange environment by a pair of colleagues — as exclusive, in this respect, as two young men from the same college — whose professional routine has furnished them with a common fund of memories to which the others present have no access, and to which they are unwilling to refer before an audience

    But the absolute control over his facial muscles to which M. de Norpois had attained allowed him to listen without seeming to hear a word. At last my father became uneasy. “I had thought,” he ventured, after an endless preamble, “of asking the advice of the Commission . . . ” Then from the face of the noble virtuoso, who had been sitting inert as a player in an orchestra sits until the moment comes for him to begin his part, were uttered, with an even delivery, on a sharp note, and as though they were no more than the completion (but scored for a different voice) of the phrase that my father had begun, the words: “of which you will not hesitate, of course, to call a meeting; more especially as the present members are all known to you personally, and there may be a change any day.” This was not in itself a very remarkable ending. But the immobility that had preceded it made it detach itself with the crystal clarity, the almost malicious unexpectedness of those phrases in which the piano, silent until then,‘takes up at a given moment, the violoncello to which one has just been listening, in a Mozart concerto

    “Well, did you enjoy your matinée?” asked my father, as we moved to the dining-room; meaning me to ‘shew off,’ and with the idea that my enthusiasm would give M. de Norpois a good opinion of me. “He has just been to hear Berma. You remember, we were talking about it the other day,” he went on, turning towards the diplomat, in the same tone of retrospective, technical, mysterious allusiveness as if he had been referring to a meeting of the Commission

    “You must have been enchanted, especially if you had never heard her before. Your father was alarmed at the effect that the little jaunt might have upon your health, which is none too good, I am told, none too robust. But I soon set his mind at rest. Theatres to-day are not what they were even twenty years ago. You have more or less comfortable seats now, and a certain amount of ventilation, although we have still a long way to go before we come up to Germany or England, which in that respect as in many others are immeasurably ahead of us. I have never seen Mme. Berma in Phèdre, but I have always heard that she is excellent in the part. You were charmed with her, of course?”

    M. de Norpois, a man a thousand times more intelligent than myself, must know that hidden truth which I had failed to extract from Berma’s playing; he knew, and would reveal it to me; in answering his question I would implore him to let me know in what that truth consisted; and he would tell me, and so justify me in the longing that I had felt to see and hear the actress. I had only a moment, I must make what use I could of it and bring my cross-examination to bear upon the essential points. But what were they? Fastening my whole attention upon my own so confused impressions, with no thought of making M. de Norpois admire me, but only that of learning from him the truth that I had still to discover, I made no attempt to substitute ready-made phrases for the words that failed me — I stood there stammering, until finally, in the hope of provoking him into declaring what there was in Berma that was admirable, I confessed that I had been disappointed

    “What’s that?” cried my father, annoyed at the bad impression which this admission of my failure to appreciate the performance must make on M. de Norpois, “What on earth do you mean; you didn’t enjoy it? Why, your grandmother has been telling us that you sat there hanging on every word that Berma uttered, with your eyes starting out of your head; that everyone else in the theatre seemed quite bored, beside you.”

    “Oh, yes, I was listening as hard as I could, trying to find out what it was that was supposed to be so wonderful about her. Of course, she’s frightfully good, and all that . . . ”

    “If she is ‘frightfully good,’ what more do you want?”

    “One of the things that have undoubtedly contributed to the success of Mme. Berma,” resumed M. de Norpois, turning with elaborate courtesy towards my mother, so as not to let her be left out of the conversation, and in conscientious fulfilment of his duty of politeness to the lady of the house, “is the perfect taste that she shews in selecting her parts; thus she can always be assured of success, and success of the right sort. She hardly ever appears in anything trivial. Look how she has thrown herself into the part of Phèdre. And then, she brings the same good taste to the choice of her costumes, and to her acting. In spite of her frequent and lucrative tours in England and America, the vulgarity — I will not say of John Bull; that would be unjust, at any rate to the England of the Victorian era — but of Uncle Sam has not infected her. No loud colours, no rant. And then that admirable voice, which has been of such service to her, with which she plays so delightfully — I should almost be tempted to describe it as a musical instrument!”

    My interest in Berma’s acting had continued to grow ever since the fall of the curtain, because it was then no longer compressed within the limits of reality; but I felt the need to find explanations for it; moreover it had been fixed with the same intensity, while Berma was on the stage, upon everything that she offered, in the indivisibility of a living whole, to my eyes and ears; there was nothing separate or distinct; it welcomed, accordingly, the discovery of a reasonable cause in these tributes paid to the simplicity, to the good taste of the actress, it attracted them to itself by its power of absorption, seized hold of them, as the optimism of a drunken man seizes hold of the actions of his neighbour, in each of which he finds an excuse for emotion. “He is right!” I told myself. “What a charming voice, what an absence of shrillness, what simple costumes, what intelligence to have chosen Phèdre. No; I have not been disappointed!”

    The cold beef, spiced with carrots, made its appearance, couched by the Michelangelo of our kitchen upon enormous crystals of jelly, like transparent blocks of quartz

    “You have a chef of the first order, Madame,” said M. de Norpois, “and that is no small matter. I myself, who have had, when abroad, to maintain a certain style in housekeeping, I know how difficult it often is to find a perfect master-cook. But this is a positive banquet that you have set before us!”

    And indeed Françoise, in the excitement of her ambition to make a success, for so distinguished a guest, of a dinner the preparation of which had been obstructed by difficulties worthy of her powers, had given herself such trouble as she no longer took when we were alone, and had recaptured her incomparable Combray manner

    “That is a thing you can’t get in a chophouse — in the best of them, I mean; a spiced beef in which the jelly does not taste of glue and the beef has caught the flavour of the carrots; it is admirable! Allow me to come again,” he went on, making a sign to shew that he wanted more of the jelly. “I should be interested to see how your Vatel managed a dish of quite a different kind; I should like, for instance, to see him tackle a boeuf Stroganoff.”

    M. de Norpois, so as to add his own contribution to the gaiety of the repast, entertained us with a number of the stories with which he was in the habit of regaling his colleagues in “the career,” quoting now some ludicrous sentence uttered by a politician, an old offender, whose sentences were always long and packed with incoherent images, now some monumental epigram of a diplomat, sparkling with attic salt. But, to tell the truth, the criterion which for him set apart these two kinds of phrase in no way resembled that which I was in the habit of applying to literature.. Most of the finer shades escaped me; the words which he repeated with derision seemed to me not to differ very greatly from those which he found remarkable. He belonged to the class of men who, had we come to discuss the books that I liked, would have said: “So you understand that, do you? I must confess that I do not understand, I am not initiated;” but I could have matched his attitude, for I did not grasp the wit or folly, the eloquence or pomposity which he found in a statement or a speech, and the absence of any perceptible reason for one’s being badly and the other’s well expressed made that sort of literature seem more mysterious, more obscure to me than any other. I could distinguish only that to repeat what everybody else was thinking was, in politics, the mark not of an inferior but of a superior mind. When M. de Norpois made use of certain expressions which were ‘common form’ in the newspapers, and uttered them with emphasis, one felt that they became an official pronouncement by the mere fact of his having employed them, and a pronouncement which would provoke a string of comment

    My mother was counting greatly upon the pineapple and truffle salad. But the Ambassador, after fastening for a moment on the confection the penetrating gaze of a trained observer, ate it with the inscrutable discretion of a diplomat, and without disclosing to us what he thought of it. My mother insisted upon his taking some more, which he did, but saying only, in place of the compliment for which she was hoping: “I obey, Madame, for I can see that it is, on your part, a positive ukase!”

    “We saw in the ‘papers that you had a long talk with King Theodosius,” my father ventured

    “Why, yes; the King, who has a wonderful memory for faces, was kind enough to remember, when he noticed me in the stalls, that I had had the honour to meet him on several occasions at the Court of Bavaria, at a time when he had never dreamed of his oriental throne — to which, as you know, he was summoned by a European Congress, and indeed had grave doubts about accepting the invitation, regarding that particular sovereignty as unworthy of his race, the noblest, heraldically speaking, in the whole of Europe. An aide-de-camp came down to bid me pay my respects to his Majesty, whose command I hastened, naturally, to obey.”

    “And I trust, you are satisfied with the results of his visit?”

    “Enchanted! One was justified in feeling some apprehension as to the manner in which a Sovereign who is still so young would handle a situation requiring tact, particularly at this highly delicate juncture. For my own part, I reposed entire confidence in the King’s political sense. But I must confess that he far surpassed my expectations. The speech that he made at the Elysée, which, according to information that has come to me from a most authoritative source, was composed, from beginning to end, by himself, was fully deserving of the interest that it has aroused in all quarters. It was simply masterly; a trifle daring, I quite admit, but with an audacity which, after all, has been fully justified by the event. Traditional diplomacy is all very well in its way, but in practice it has made his country and ours live in an hermetically sealed atmosphere in which it was no longer possible to breathe. Very well! There is one method of letting in fresh air, obviously not one of the methods which one could officially recommend, but one which King Theodosius might allow himself to adopt — and that is to break the windows. Which he accordingly did, with a spontaneous good humour that delighted everybody, and also with an aptness in his choice of words in which one could at once detect the race of scholarly princes from whom he is descended through his mother. There can be no question that when he spoke of the ‘affinities’ that bound his country to France, the expression, rarely as it may occur in the vocabulary of the Chancellories, was a singularly happy one. You see that literary ability is no drawback, even in diplomacy, even upon a throne,” he went on, turning for a moment to myself. “The community of interests had long been apparent, I quite admit, and the relations of the two Powers were excellent. Still, it needed putting into words. The word was what we were all waiting for, it was chosen with marvellous aptitude; you have seen the effect it had. For my part, I must confess I applauded openly.”

    “Your friend M. de Vaugoubert will be pleased, after preparing for the agreement all these years.”

    “All the more so that his Majesty, who is quite incorrigible, really, in some ways, had taken care to spring it on him as a surprise. And it did come as a complete surprise, incidentally, to everyone concerned, beginning with the Foreign Minister himself, who — I have heard — did not find it at all to his liking. It appears that someone spoke to him about it and that he replied, pretty sharply, and loud enough to be overheard by the people on either side of them: ‘I have been neither consulted nor informed!’ indicating clearly by that that he declined to accept any responsibility for the consequences. I must own that the incident has given rise to a great deal of comment, and I should not go so far as to deny,” he went on with a malicious smile, “that certain of my colleagues, for whom the supreme law appears to be that of inertia, may have been shaken from their habitual repose. As for Vaugoubert, you are aware that he has been bitterly attacked for his policy of bringing that country into closer relations with France, which must have been more than ordinarily painful to him, he is so sensitive, such an exquisite nature. I can amply testify to that, since, for all that he is considerably my junior, I have had many dealings with him, we are friends of long standing and I know him intimately. Besides, who could help knowing him? His is a heart of crystal. Indeed, that is the one fault that there is to be found with him; it is not necessary for the heart of a diplomat to be as transparent as all that. Still, that does not prevent their talking of sending him to Rome, which would be a fine rise for him, but a pretty big plum to swallow. Between ourselves, I fancy that Vaugoubert, utterly devoid of ambition as he is, would be very well pleased, and would by no means ask for that cup to pass from him. For all we know, he may do wonders down there; he is the chosen candidate of the Consulta, and for my part I can see him very well placed, with his artistic leanings, in the setting of the Farnese Palace and the Caracci Gallery. At least you would suppose that it was impossible for any one to hate him; but there is a whole camarilla collected round King Theodosius which is more or less held in fief by the Wilhelmstrasse, whose inspiration its members dutifully absorb, and these men have done everything in their power to checkmate him. Not only has Vaugoubert had to face these backstairs intrigues, he has had to endure also the insults of a gang of hireling pamphleteers who later on, being like every subsidised journalist the most arrant cowards, have been the first to cry quits, but in the interval had not shrunk from hurling at our Representative the most fatuous accusations that the wit of irresponsible fools could invent. For a month and more Vaugoubert’s enemies had been dancing round him, howling for his scalp,” M. de Norpois detached this word with shacp emphasis. “But forewarned is forearmed; as for their insults, he spurned them with his foot!” he went on with even more determination, and with so fierce a glare in his eye that for a moment we forgot our food. “In the words of a fine Arab proverb, ‘The dogs may bark; the caravan goes on!’” After launching this quotation M. de Norpois paused and examined our faces, to see what effect it had had upon us. Its effect was great, the proverb being familiar to us already. It had taken the place, that year, among people who ‘really counted,’ of “He who sows the wind shall reap the whirlwind,” which was sorely in need of a rest, not having the perennial freshness of “Working for the King of Prussia.” For the culture of these eminent men was an alternate, if not a tripartite and triennial culture. Of course, the use of quotations such as these, with which M. de Norpois excelled in jewelling his articles in the Revue, was in no way essential to their appearing solid and well-informed. Even without the ornament which the quotations supplied, it sufficed that M. de Norpois should write at a given point (as he never failed to write): “The Court of St. James’s was not the last to be sensible of the peril,” or “Feeling ran high on the Singers’ Bridge, which with anxious eyes was following the selfish but skilful policy of the Dual Monarchy,” or “A cry of alarm sounded from Montecitorio,” or yet again, “That everlasting double-dealing which is so characteristic of the Ballplatz.” By these expressions the profane reader had at once recognised and had paid deference to the diplomat de carrière. But what had made people say that he was something more than that, that he was endowed with a superior culture, had been his careful use of quotations, the perfect example of which, at that date, was still: “Give me a good policy and I will give you good finances, to quote the favourite words of Baron Louis“: for we had not yet imported from the Far East: “Victory is on the side that can hold out a quarter of an hour longer than the other,as the Japanese say.” This reputation for immense literary gifts, combined with a positive genius for intrigue which he kept concealed beneath a mask of indifference, had secured the election of M. de Norpois to the Académie des Sciences Morales. And there were some who even thought that he would riot be out of place in the Académie Française, on the famous day when, wishing to indicate that it was only by drawing the Russian Alliance closer that we could hope to arrive at an understanding with Great Britain, he had not hesitated to write: “Be it clearly understood in the Quai d’Orsay, be it taught henceforward in all the manuals of geography, which appear to be incomplete in this respect, be his certificate of graduation remorselessly withheld from every candidate who has not learned to say, ‘If all roads lead to Rome, nevertheless the way from Paris to London runs of necessity through St. Petersburg.’”

    “In short,” M. de Norpois went on, addressing my father, “Vaugoubert has won himself considerable distinction from this affair, quite beyond anything on which he can have reckoned. He expected, you understand, a correctly worded speech (which, after the storm-clouds of recent years, would have been something to the good) but nothing more. Several persons who had the honour to be present have assured me that it is impossible, when one merely reads the speech, to form any conception of the effect that it produced when uttered — when articulated with marvellous clearness of diction by the King, who is a master of the art of public speaking and in that passage underlined every possible shade of meaning. I allowed myself, in this connexion, to listen to a little anecdote which brings into prominence once again that frank, boyish charm by which King Theo-dosius has won so many hearts. I am assured that, just as he uttered that word ‘affinities,’ which was, of course, the startling innovation of the speech, and one that, as you will see, will provoke discussion in the Chancellories for years to come, his Majesty, anticipating the delight of our Ambassador, who was to find in that word the seal, the crown set upon all his labours, on his dreams, one might almost say, and, in a word, his marshal’s baton, made a half turn towards Vaugoubert and fixing upon him his arresting gaze, so characteristic of the Oettingens, fired at him that admirably chosen word ‘affinities,’ a positive treasure-trove, uttering it in a tone which made it plain to all his hearers that it was employed of set purpose and with full knowledge of the circumstances. It appears that Vaugoubert found some difficulty in mastering his emotion, and I must confess that, to a certain extent, I can well understand it. Indeed, a person who is entirely to be believed has told me, in confidence, that the King came up to Vaugoubert after the dinner, when His Majesty was holding an informal court, and was heard to say, ‘Well, are you satisfied with your pupil, my dear Marquis?’

    “One thing, however,” M. de Norpois concluded, “is certain; and that is that a speech like that has done more than twenty years of negotiation towards bringing the two countries together, uniting their ‘affinities,’ to borrow the picturesque expression of Theodosius II. It is no more than a word, if you like, but look what success it has had, how the whole of the European press is repeating it, what interest it has aroused, what a new note it has struck. Besides it is distinctly in the young Sovereign’s manner. I will not go so far as to say that he lights upon a diamond of that water every day. But it is very seldom that, in his prepared speeches, or better still in the impulsive flow of his conversation, he does not reveal his character — I was on the point of saying ‘does not affix his signature’— by the use of some incisive word. I myself am quite free from any suspicion of partiality in this respect, for I am stoutly opposed to all innovations in terminology. Nine times out of ten they are most dangerous.”

    “Yes, I was thinking, only the other day, that the German Emperor’s telegram could not be much to your liking,” said my father

    M. de Norpois raised his eyes to heaven, as who should say, “Oh, that fellow!” before he replied: “In the first place, it is an act of ingratitude. It is more than a crime; it is a blunder, and one of a crassness which I can describe only as pyramidal! Indeed, unless some one puts a check on his activities, the man who has got rid of Bismarck is quite capable of repudiating by degrees the whole of the Bismarckian policy; after which it will be a leap in the dark.”

    “My husband tells me, sir, that you are perhaps going to take him to Spain one summer; that will be nice for him; I am so glad.”

    “Why, yes; it is an idea that greatly attracts me; I amuse myself, planning a tour. I should like to go there with you, my dear fellow. But what about you, Madame; have you decided yet how you are going to spend your holidays?”

    “I shall perhaps go with my son to Balbec, but I am not certain.”

    “Oh, but Balbec is quite charming, I was down that way a few years ago. They are beginning to build some very pretty little-villas there; I think you’ll like the place. But may I ask what has made you choose Balbec?”

    “My son is very anxious to visit some of the churches in that neighbourhood, and Balbec church in particular. I was a little afraid that the tiring journey there, and the discomfort of staying in the place might be too much for him. But I hear that they have just opened an excellent hotel, in which he will be able to get all the comfort that he requires.”

    “Indeed! I must make a note of that, for a certain person who will not turn up her nose at a comfortable hotel.”

    “The church at Balbec is very beautiful, sir, is it not?” I inquired, repressing my sorrow at learning that one of the attractions of Balbec consisted in its pretty little villas

    “No, it is not bad; but it cannot be compared for a moment with such positive jewels in stone as the Cathedrals of Rheims and Chartres, or with what is to my mind the pearl among them all, the Sainte-Chapelle here in Paris.”

    “But, surely, Balbec church is partly romanesque, is it not?”

    “Why, yes, it is in the romanesque style, which is to say very cold and lifeless, with no hint in it anywhere of the grace, the fantasy of the later gothic builders, who worked their stone as if it had been so much lace. Balbec church is well worth a visit, if you are in those parts; it is decidedly quaint; on a wet day, when you have nothing better to do, you might look inside; you will see the tomb of Tourville.”

    “Tell me, were you at the Foreign Ministry dinner last night?” asked my father. “I couldn’t go.”

    “No,” M. de Norpois smiled, “I must confess that I renounced it for a party of a very different sort. I was dining with a lady whose name you may possibly have heard, the beautiful Mme. Swann.” My mother checked an impulsive movement, for, being more rapid in perception than my father, she used to alarm herself on his account over things which only began to upset him a moment later. Anything unpleasant that might occur to him was discovered first by her, just as bad news from France is always known abroad sooner than among ourselves. But she was curious to know what sort of people the Swanns managed to entertain, and so inquired of M. de Norpois as to whom he had met there

    “Why, my dear lady, it is a house which (or so it struck me) is especially attractive to gentlemen. There were several married men there last night, but their wives were all, as it happened, unwell, and so had not come with them,” replied the Ambassador with a mordancy sheathed in good-humour, casting on each of us a glance the gentleness and discretion of which appeared to be tempering while in reality they deftly intensified its malice

    “In all fairness,” he went on, “I must add that women do go to the house, but women who belong rather — what shall I say — to the Republican world than to Swann’s” (he pronounced it “Svann’s”) “circle. Still, you can never tell. Perhaps it will turn into a political or a literary salon some day. Anyhow, they appear to be quite happy as they are. Indeed, I feel that Swann advertises his happiness just a trifle too blatantly. He told us the names of all the people who had asked him and his wife out for the next week, people with whom there was no particular reason to be proud of being intimate, with a want of reserve, of taste, almost of tact which I was astonished to remark in so refined a man. He kept on repeating, ‘We haven’t a free evening!’ as though that had been a thing to boast of, positively like a parvenu, and he is certainly not that. For Swann had always plenty of friends, women as well as men, and without seeming over-bold, without the least wish to appear indiscreet, I think I may safely say that not all of them, of course, nor even the majority of them, but one at least, who is a lady of the very highest rank, would perhaps not have shewn herself inexorably averse from the idea of entering upon relations with Mme. Swann, in which case it is safe to assume that more than one sheep of the social flock would have followed her lead. But it seems that there has been no indication on Swann’s part of any movement in that direction

    “What do I see? A Nesselrode pudding! As well! I declare, I shall need a course at Carlsbad after such a Lucullus-feast as this

    “Possibly Swann felt that there would be too much resistance to overcome. The marriage — so much is certain — was not well received. There has been some talk of his wife’s having money, but that is all humbug. Anyhow, the whole affair has been looked upon with disfavour. And then, Swann has an aunt who is excessively rich and in an admirable position socially, married to a man who, financially speaking, is a power. Not only has she refused to meet Mme. Swann, she has actually started a campaign to force her friends and acquaintances to do the same. I do not mean to say that anyone who moves in a good circle in Paris has shewn any actual incivility to Mme. Swann. . . . No! A hundred times no! Quite apart from her husband’s being eminently a man to take up the challenge. Anyhow, there is one curious thing about it, to see the immense importance that Swann, who knows so many and such exclusive people, attaches to a society of which the best that can be said is that it is extremely mixed. I myself, who knew him in the old days, must admit that I felt more astonished than amused at seeing a man so well-bred as he is, so much at home in the best houses, effusively thanking the Chief Secretary to the Minister of Posts for having come to them, and asking him whether Mme. Swann might take the liberty of calling upon his wife. He must feel something of an exile, don’t you know; evidently, it’s quite a different world. I don’t think, all the same, that Swann is unhappy. It is true that for some years before the marriage she was always trying to blackmail him in a rather disgraceful way; she would take the child away whenever Swann refused her anything. Poor Swann, who is as unsophisticated as he is, for all that, sharp, believed every time that the child’s disappearance was a coincidence, and declined to face the facts. Apart from that, she made such continual scenes that everyone expected that, from the day she attained her object and was safely married, nothing could possibly restrain her and that their life would be a hell on earth. Instead of which, just the opposite has happened. People are inclined to laugh at the way in which Swann speaks of his wife; it’s become a standing joke. Of course, one could hardly expect that, conscious, more or less of being a —(you remember Molière’s line) he would go and proclaim it urbi et orbi; still that does not prevent one from finding a tendency in him to exaggerate when he declares that she makes an excellent wife. And yet that is not so far from the truth as people imagine. In her own way — which is not, perhaps, what all husbands would prefer, but then, between you and me, I find it difficult to believe that Swann, who has known her for ever so long and is far from being an utter fool, did not know what to expect — there can be no denying that she does seem to have a certain regard for him. I do not say that she is not flighty, and Swann himself has no fault to find with her for that, if one is to believe the charitable tongues which, as you may suppose, continue to wag. But she is distinctly grateful to him for what he has done for her, and, despite the fears that were everywhere expressed of the contrary, her temper seems to have become angelic.”

    This alteration was perhaps not so extraordinary as M. de Norpois professed to find it. Odette had not believed that Swann would ever consent to marry her; each time that she made the suggestive announcement that some man about town had just married his mistress she had seen him stiffen into a glacial silence, or at the most, if she were directly to challenge him, asking: “Don’t you think it very nice, a very fine thing that he has done, for a woman who sacrificed all her youth to him?” had heard him answer dryly: “But I don’t say that there’s anything wrong in it. Everyone does what he himself thinks right.” She came very near, indeed, to believing that (as he used to threaten in moments of anger) he was going to leave her altogether, for she had heard it said, not long since, by a woman sculptor, that “You cannot be surprised at anything men do, they’re such brutes,” and impressed by the profundity of this maxim of pessimism she had appropriated it for herself, and repeated it on every possible occasion with an air of disappointment which seemed to imply: “After all, it’s not impossible in any way; it would be just my luck.” Meanwhile all the virtue had gone from the optimistic maxim which had hitherto guided Odette through life: “You can do anything with men when they’re in love with you, they’re such idiots!” a doctrine which was expressed on her face by the same tremor of an eyelid that might have accompanied such words as: “Don’t be frightened; he won’t break anything.” While she waited, Odette was tormented by the thought of what one of her friends, who had been married by a man who had not lived with her for nearly so long as Odette herself had lived with Swann, and had had no child by him, and who was now in a definitely respectable position, invited to the balls at the Elysée and so forth, must think of Swann’s behaviour. A consultant more discerning than M. de Norpois would doubtless have been able to diagnose that it was this feeling of shame and humiliation that had embittered Odette, that the devilish characteristics which she displayed were no essential part of her, no irremediable evil, and so would easily have foretold what had indeed come to pass, namely that a new rule of life, the matrimonial, would put an end, with almost magic swiftness, to these painful incidents, of daily occurrence but in no sense organic. Practically everyone was surprised at the marriage, and this, in itself, is surprising. No doubt very few people understand the purely subjective nature of the phenomenon that we call love, or how it creates, so to speak, a fresh, a third, a supplementary person, distinct from the person whom the world knows by the same name, a person most of whose constituent elements are derived from ourself, the lover. And so there are very few who can regard as natural the enormous proportions that a creature comes to assume in our eyes who is not the same as the creature that they see. It would appear, none the less, that so far as Odette was concerned people might have taken into account the fact that if, indeed, she had never entirely understood Swann’s mentality, at least she was acquainted with the titles, and with all the details of his studies, so much so that the name of Vermeer was as familiar to her as that of her own dressmaker; while as for Swann himself she knew intimately those traits of character of which the rest of the world must remain ignorant or merely laugh at them, and only a mistress or a sister may gain possession of the revealing, cherished image; and so strongly are we attached to such eccentricities, even to those of them which we are most anxious to correct, that it is because a woman comes in time to acquire an indulgent, an affectionately mocking familiarity, such as we ourselves have with them, or our relatives have, that amours of long standing have something of the sweetness and strength of family affection. The bonds that unite us to another creature receive their consecration when that creature adopts the same point of view as ourself in judging one of our imperfections. And among these special traits there were others, besides, which belonged as much to his intellect as to his character, which, all the same, because they had their roots in the latter, Odette had been able more easily to discern. She complained that when Swann turned author, when he published his essays, these characteristics were not to be found in them as they were in his letters, or in his conversation, where they abounded. She urged him to give them a more prominent place. She would have liked that because it was these things that she herself preferred in him, but since she preferred them because they were the things most typical of himself, she was perhaps not wrong in wishing that they might be found in his writings. Perhaps also she thought that his work, if endowed with more vitality, so that it ultimately brought him success, might enable her also to form what at the Verdurins’ she had been taught to value above everything else in the world — a salon

    Among the people to whom this sort of marriage appeared ridiculous, people who in their own case would ask themselves, “What will M. de Guermantes think, what will Bréauté say when I marry Mlle, de Montmorency?”, among the people who cherished that sort of social ideal would have figured, twenty years earlier, Swann himself, the Swarm who had taken endless pains to get himself elected to the Jockey Club, and had reckoned at that time on making a brilliant marriage which, by consolidating his position, would have made him one of the most conspicuous figures in Paris. Only, the visions which a marriage like that suggests to the mind of the interested party need, like all visions, if they are not to fade away and be altogether lost, to receive sustenance from without. Your most ardent longing is to humiliate the man who has insulted you. But if you never hear of him again, having removed to some other place, your enemy will come to have no longer the slightest importance for you. If one has lost sight for a score of years of all the people on whose account one would have liked to be elected to the Jockey Club or the Institute, the prospect of becoming a member of one or other of those corporations will have ceased to tempt one. Now fully as much as retirement, ill-health or religious conversion, protracted relations with a woman will substitute fresh visions for the old. There was not on Swann’s part, when he married Odette, any renunciation of his social ambitions, for from these ambitions Odette had long ago, in the spiritual sense of the word, detached him. Besides, had he not been so detached, his marriage would have been all the more creditable. It is because they imply the sacrifice of a more or less advantageous position to a purely private happiness that, as a general rule, ‘impossible’ marriages are the happiest of all. (One cannot very well include among the ‘impossible’ marriages those that are made for money, there being no instance on record of a couple, of whom the wife or even the husband has thus sold himself, who have not sooner or later been admitted into society, if only by tradition, and on the strength of so many precedents, and so as not to have two conflicting standards.) Perhaps, on the other hand, the artistic, if not the perverse side of Swann’s nature would in any event have derived a certain amount of pleasure from coupling with himself, in one of those crossings of species such as Mendelians practise and mythology records, a creature of a different race, archduchess or prostitute, from contracting a royal alliance or from marrying beneath him. There had been but one person in all the world whose opinion he took into consideration whenever he thought of his possible marriage with Odette; that was, and from no snobbish motive, the Duchesse de Guermantes. With whom Odette, on the contrary, was but little concerned, thinking only of those people whose position was immediately above her own, rather than in so vague an empyrean. But when Swann in his daydreams saw Odette as already his wife he invariably formed a picture of the moment in which he would take her — her, and above all her daughter — to call upon the Princesse des Laumes (who was shortly, on the death of her father-in-law, to become Duchesse de Guermantes). He had no desire to introduce them anywhere else, but his heart would soften as he invented — uttering their actual words to himself — all the things that the Duchess would say of him to Odette, and Odette to the Duchess, the affection that she would shew for Gilberte, spoiling her, making him proud of his child. He enacted to himself the scene of this introduction with the same precision in each of its imaginary details that people shew when they consider how they would spend, supposing they were to win it, a lottery prize the amount of which they have arbitrarily determined. In so far as a mental picture which accompanies one of our resolutions may be said to be its motive, so it might be said that if Swann married Odette it was in order to present her and Gilberte, without anyone’s else being present, without, if need be, anyone’s else ever coming to know of it, to the Duchesse de Guermantes. We shall see how this sole social ambition that he had entertained for his wife and daughter was precisely that one the realisation of which proved to be forbidden him by a veto so absolute that Swann died in the belief that the Duchess would never possibly come to know them. We shall see also that, on the contrary, the Duchesse de Guermantes did associate with Odette and Gilberte after the death of Swann. And doubtless he would have been wiser — seeing that he could attach so much importance to so small a matter — not to have formed too dark a picture of tie future, in this connexion, but to have consoled himself with the hope that the meeting of the ladies might indeed take place when he was no longer there to enjoy it. The laborious process of causation which sooner or later will bring about every possible effect, including (consequently) those which one had believed to be most nearly impossible, naturally slow at times, is rendered slower still by our impatience (which in seeking to accelerate only obstructs it) and by our very existence, and comes to fruition only when we have ceased to desire it — have ceased, possibly, to live. Was not Swann conscious of this from his own experience, had there not been already, in his life, as it were a préfiguration of what was to happen after his death, a posthumous happiness in this marriage with this Odette whom he had passionately loved — even if she had not been pleasing to him at first sight — whom he had married when he no longer loved her, when the creature that, in Swann, had so longed to live, had so despaired of living all its life in company with Odette, when that creature was extinct?

    I began next to speak of the Comte de Paris, to ask whether he was not one of Swann’s friends, for I was afraid lest the conversation should drift away from him. “Why, yes!” replied M. de Norpois, turning towards me and fixing upon my modest person the azure gaze in which floated, as in their vital element, his immense capacity for work and his power of assimilation. And “Upon my word,” he added, once more addressing my father, “I do not think that I shall be overstepping the bounds of the respect which I have always professed for the Prince (although without, you understand, maintaining any personal relations with him, which would inevitably compromise my position, unofficial as that may be), if I tell you of a little episode which is not without point; no more than four years ago, at a small railway station in one of the countries of Central Europe, the Prince happened to set eyes on Mme. Swann. Naturally, none of his circle ventured to ask his Royal Highness what he thought of her. That would not have been seemly. But when her name came up by chance in conversation, by certain signs — imperceptible, if you like, but quite unmistakable — the Prince appeared willing enough to let it be understood that his impression of her had, in a word, been far from unfavourable.”

    “But there could have been no possibility, surely, of her being presented to the Comte de Paris?” inquired my father

    “Well, we don’t know; with Princes one never does know,” replied M. de Norpois. “The most exalted, those who know best how to secure what is due to them, are as often as not the last to let themselves be embarrassed by the decrees of popular opinion, even by those for which there is most justification, especially when it is a question of their rewarding a personal attachment to themselves. Now it is certain that the Comte de Paris has always most graciously recognised the devotion of Swann, who is, for that matter, a man of character, in spite of it all.”

    “And what was your own impression, your Excellency? Do tell us!” my mother asked, from politeness as well as from curiosity

    All the energy of the old connoisseur broke through the habitual moderation of his speech as he answered: “Quite excellent!”

    And knowing that the admission that a strong impression has been made on one by a woman takes its place, provided that one makes it in a playful tone, in a certain category of the art of conversation that is highly appreciated, he broke into a little laugh that lasted for several seconds, moistening the old diplomat’s blue eyes and making his nostrils, with their network of tiny scarlet veins, quiver. “She is altogether charming!”

    “Was there a writer of the name of Bergotte at this dinner, sir?” I asked timidly, still trying to keep the conversation to the subject of the Swanns

    “Yes, Bergotte was there,” replied M. de Norpois, inclining his head courteously towards me, as though in his desire to be pleasant to my father he attached to everything connected with him a real importance, even to the questions of a boy of my age who was not accustomed to see such politeness shewn to him by persons of his. “Do you know him?” he went on, fastening on me that clear gaze, the penetration of which had won the praise of Bismarck

    “My son does not know him, but he admires his work immensely,” my mother explained

    “Good heavens!” exclaimed M. de Norpois, inspiring me with doubts of my own intelligence far more serious than those that ordinarily distracted me, when I saw that what I valued a thousand thousand times more than myself, what I regarded as the most exalted thing in the world, was for him at the very foot of the scale of admiration. “I do not share your son’s point of view. Bergotte is what I call a flute-player: one must admit that he plays on it very agreeably, although with a great deal of mannerism, of affectation. But when all is said, it is no more than that, and that is nothing very great. Nowhere does one find in his enervated writings anything that could be called construction. No action — or very little — but above all no range. His books fail at the foundation, or rather they have no foundation at all. At a time like the present, when the ever-increasing complexity of life leaves one scarcely a moment for reading, when the map of Europe has undergone radical alterations, and is on the eve, very probably, of undergoing others more drastic still, when so many new and threatening problems are arising on every side, you will allow me to suggest that one is entitled to ask that a writer should be something else than a fine intellect which makes us forget, amid otiose and byzantine discussions of the merits of pure form, that we may be overwhelmed at any moment by a double tide of barbarians, those from without and those from within our borders. I am aware that this is a blasphemy against the sacrosanct school of what these gentlemen term ‘Art for Art’s sake,’ but at this period of history there are tasks more urgent than the manipulation of words in a harmonious manner. Not that Bergotte’s manner is not now and then quite attractive. I have no fault to find with that, but taken as a whole, it is all very precious, very thin, and has very little virility. I can now understand more easily, when I bear in mind your altogether excessive regard for Bergotte, the few lines that you shewed me just now, which it would have been unfair to you not to overlook, since you yourself told me, in all simplicity, that they were merely a childish scribbling.” (I had, indeed, said so, but I did not think anything of the sort.) “For every sin there is forgiveness, and especially for the sins of youth. After all, others as well as yourself have such sins upon their conscience, and you are not the only one who has believed himself to be a poet in his day. But one can see in what you have shewn me the evil influence of Bergotte. You will not, of course, be surprised when I say that there was in it none of his good qualities, since he is a past-master in the art — incidentally quite superficial — of handling a certain style of which, at your age, you cannot have acquired even the rudiments. But already there is the same fault, that paradox of stringing together fine-sounding words and only afterwards troubling about what they mean. That is putting the cart before the horse, even in Bergotte’s books. All those Chinese puzzles of form, all these deliquescent mandarin subtleties seem to me to be quite futile. Given a few fireworks, let off prettily enough by an author, and up goes the shout of genius. Works of genius are not so common as all that! Bergotte cannot place to his credit — does not carry in his baggage, if I may use the expression — a single novel that is at all lofty in its conception, any of those books which one keeps in a special corner of one’s library. I do not discover one such in the whole of his work. But that does not exclude the fact that, with him, the work is infinitely superior to the author. Ah! there is a man who justifies the wit who insisted that one ought never to know an author except through his books. It would be impossible to imagine an individual who corresponded less to his — more pretentious, more pompous, less fitted for human society. Vulgar at some moments, at others talking like a book, and not even like one of his own, but like a boring book, which his, to do them justice, are not — such is your Bergotte. He has the most confused mind, alembicated, what our ancestors called a diseur de phébus, and he makes the things that he says even more unpleasant by the manner in which he says them. I forget for the moment whether it is Loménie or Sainte-Beuve who tells us that Vigny repelled people by the same eccentricity. But Bergotte has never given us a Cinq-Mars, or a Cachet Rouge, certain pages of which are regular anthology pieces.”

    Paralysed by what M. de Norpois had just said to me with regard to the fragment which I had submitted to him, and remembering at the same time the difficulties that I experienced when I attempted to write an essay or merely to devote myself to serious thought, I felt conscious once again of my intellectual nullity and that I was not born for a literary life. Doubtless in the old days at Combray certain impressions of a very humble order, or a few pages of Bergotte used to plunge me into a state of musing which had appeared to me to be of great value. But this state was what my poem in prose reflected; there could be no doubt that M. de Norpois had at once grasped and had seen through the fallacy of what I had discovered to be beautiful simply by a mirage that must be entirely false since the Ambassador had not been taken in by it. He had shewn me, on the other hand, what an infinitely unimportant place was mine when I was judged from outside, objectively, by the best-disposed and most intelligent of experts. I felt myself to be struck speechless, overwhelmed; and my mind, like a fluid which is without dimensions save those of the vessel that is provided for it, just as it had been expanded a moment ago so as to fill all the vast capacity of genius, contracted now, was entirely contained in the straitened mediocrity in which M. de Norpois had of a sudden enclosed and sealed it

    “Our first introduction — I speak of Bergotte and myself ——” he resumed, turning to my father, “was somewhat beset with thorns (which is, after all, only another way of saying that it was not lacking in points). Bergotte — some years ago, now — paid a visit to Vienna while I was Ambassador there; he was presented to me by the Princess Metternich, came and wrote his name, and expected to be asked to the Embassy. Now, being in a foreign country as the Representative of France, to which he has after all done some honour by his writings, to a certain extent (let us say, to be quite accurate, to a very slight extent), I was prepared to set aside the unfavourable opinion that I hold of his private life. But he was not travelling alone, and he actually let it be understood that he was not to be invited without his companion. I trust that I am no more of a prude than most men, and, being a bachelor, I was perhaps in a position to throw open the doors of the Embassy a little wider than if I had been married and the father of a family. Nevertheless, I must admit that there are depths of degradation to which I should hesitate to descend, while these are rendered more repulsive still by the tone, not moral, merely — let us be quite frank and say moralising — that Bergotte takes up in his books, where one finds nothing but perpetual and, between ourselves, somewhat wearisome analyses, torturing scruples, morbid remorse, and all for the merest peccadilloes, the most trivial naughtinesses (as one knows from one’s own experience), while all the time he is shewing such an utter lack of conscience and so much cynicism in his private life. To cut a long story short, I evaded the responsibility, the Princess returned to the charge, but without success. So that I do not suppose that I appear exactly in the odour of sanctity to the gentleman, and I am not sure how far he appreciated Swann’s kindness in inviting him and myself on the same evening. Unless of course it was he who asked for the invitation. One can never tell, for really he is not normal. Indeed that is his sole excuse.”

    “And was Mme. Swann’s daughter at the dinner?” I asked M. de Norpois, taking advantage, to put this question, of a moment in which, as we all moved towards the drawing-room, I could more easily conceal my emotion than would have been possible at table, where I was held fast in the glare of the lamplight

    M. de Norpois appeared to be trying for a moment to remember; then: “Yes, you mean a young person of fourteen or fifteen? Yes, of course, I remember now that she was introduced to me before dinner as the daughter of our Amphitryon. I may tell you that I saw but little of her; she retired to bed early. Or else she went out to see a friend — I forget. But I can see that you are very intimate with the Swann household.”

    “I play with Mlle. Swann in the Champs-Elysées, and she is delightful.”

    “Oh! so that is it, is it? But I assure you, I thought her charming. I must confess to you, however, that I do not believe that she will ever be anything like her mother, if I may say as much without wounding you in a vital spot.”

    “I prefer Mlle. Swann’s face, but I admire her mother, too, enormously; I go for walks in the Bois simply in the hope of seeing her pass.”

    “Ah! But I must tell them that; they will be highly flattered.”

    While he was uttering these words, and for a few seconds after he had uttered them, M. de Norpois was still in the same position as anyone else who, hearing me speak of Swann as an intelligent man, of his family as respectable stockbrokers, of his house as a fine house, imagined that I would speak just as readily of another man equally intelligent, of other stockbrokers equally respectable, of another house equally fine; it was the moment in which a sane man who is talking to a lunatic has not yet perceived that his companion is mad. M. de Norpois knew that there was nothing unnatural in the pleasure which one derived from looking at pretty women, that it was a social convention, when anyone spoke to you of a pretty woman with any fervour, to pretend to think that he was in love with her, and to promise to further his designs. But in saying that he would speak of me to Gilberte and her mother (which would enable me, like an Olympian deity who has taken on the fluidity of a breath of wind, or rather the aspect of the old greybeard whose form Minerva borrows, to penetrate, myself, unseen, into Mme. Swann’s drawing-room, to attract her attention, to occupy her thoughts, to arouse her gratitude for my admiration, to appear before her as the friend of an important person, to seem to her worthy to be invited by her in the future and to enter into the intimate life of her family), this important person who was going to make use, in my interests, of the great influence which he must have with Mme. Swann inspired in me suddenly an affection so compelling that I had difficulty in restraining myself from kissing his gentle hands, white and crumpled, which looked as though they had been left lying too long in water. I even sketched in the air an outline of that impulsive movement, but this I supposed that I alone had observed. For it is difficult for any of us to calculate exactly on what scale his words or his gestures are apparent to others. Partly from the fear of exaggerating our own importance, and also because we enlarge to enormous proportions the field over which the impressions formed by other people in the course of their lives are obliged to extend, we imagine that the accessories of our speech and attitudes scarcely penetrate the consciousness, still less remain in the memory of those with whom we converse, It is, we may suppose, to a prompting of this sort that criminals yield when they ‘touch up’ the wording of a statement already made, thinking that the new variant cannot be confronted with any existing version. But it is quite possible that, even in what concerns the millennial existence of the human race, the philosophy of the journalist, according to which everything is destined to oblivion, is less true than a contrary philosophy which would predict the conservation of everything. In the same newspaper in which the moralist of the ‘Paris column’ says to us of an event, of a work of art, all the more forcibly of a singer who has enjoyed her ‘crowded hour’: “Who will remember this in ten years’ time?” overleaf does not the report of the Académie des Inscriptions speak often of a fact, in itself of smaller importance, of a poem of little merit, which dates from the epoch of the Pharaohs and is now known again in its entirety? Is it not, perhaps, just the same in our brief life on earth? And yet, some years later, in a house in which M. de Norpois, who was also calling there, had seemed to me the most solid support that I could hope to find, because he was the friend of my father, indulgent, inclined to wish us all well, and besides, by his profession and upbringing, trained to discretion, when, after the Ambassador had gone, I was told that he had alluded to an evening long ago when he had seen the moment in which I was just going to kiss his hands, not only did I colour up to the roots of my hair but I was stupefied to learn how different from all that I had believed were not only the manner in which M. de Norpois spoke of me but also the constituents of his memory: this tittle-tattle enlightened me as to the incalculable proportions of absence and presence of mind, of recollection and forgetfulness which go to form the human intelligence; and I was as marvellously surprised as on the day on which I read for the first time, in one of Maspero’s books, that we had an exact list of the sportsmen whom Assurbanipal used to invite to his hunts, a thousand years before the Birth of Christ

    “Oh, sir,” I assured M. de Norpois, when he told me that he would inform Gilberte and her mother how much I admired them, “if you would do that, if you would speak of me to Mme. Swann, my whole life would not be long enough for me to prove my gratitude, and that life would be all at your service. But I feel bound to point out to you that I do not know Mme. Swann, and that I have never been introduced to her.”

    I had added these last words from a scruple of conscience, and so as not to appear to be boasting of an acquaintance which I did not possess. But while I was uttering them I felt that they were already superfluous, for from the beginning of my speech of thanks, with its chilling ardour, I had seen flitting across the face of the Ambassador an expression of hesitation and dissatisfaction, and in his eyes that vertical, narrow, slanting look (like, in the drawing of a solid body in perspective, the receding line of one of its surfaces), that look which one addresses to the invisible audience whom one has within oneself at the moment when one is saying something that one’s other audience, the person whom one has been addressing — myself, in this instance — is not meant to hear. I realised in a flash that these phrases which I had pronounced, which, feeble as they were when measured against the flood of gratitude that was coursing through me, had seemed to me bound to touch M. de Norpois and to confirm his decision upon an intervention which would have given him so little trouble and me so much joy, were perhaps (out of all those that could have been chosen, with diabolical malice, by persons anxious to do me harm) the only ones that could result in making him abandon his intention. Indeed, when he heard me speak, just as at the moment when a stranger with whom we have been exchanging — quite pleasantly — our impressions, which we might suppose to be similar to his, of the passers-by, whom we have agreed in regarding as vulgar, reveals suddenly the pathological abyss that divides him from us by adding carelessly, as he runs his hand over his pocket: “What a pity, I haven’t got my revolver here; I could have picked off the lot!” M. de Norpois, who knew that nothing was less costly or more easy than to be commended to Mme. Swann and taken to her house, and saw that to me, on the contrary, such favours bore so high a price and were consequently, no doubt, of great difficulty, thought that the desire, apparently normal, which I had expressed must cloak some different thought, some suspect intention, some pre-existent fault, on account of which, in the certainty of displeasing Mme. Swann, no one hitherto had been willing to undertake the responsibility for conveying a message to her from me. And I understood that this office was one which he would never discharge, that he might see Mme. Swann daily, for years to come, without ever mentioning my name. He did indeed ask her, a few days later, for some information which I required, and charged my father to convey it to me. But he had not thought it his duty to tell her at whose instance he was inquiring. So she would never discover that I knew M. de Norpois and that I hoped so greatly to be asked to her house; and this was perhaps a less misfortune than I supposed. For the second of these discoveries would probably not have added much to the efficacy, in any event uncertain, of the first. In Odette the idea of her own life and of her home awakened no mysterious disturbance; a person who knew her, who came to see her, did not seem to her a fabulous creature such as he seemed to me who would have flung a stone through Swann’s windows if I could have written upon it that I knew M. de Norpois; I was convinced that such a message, even when transmitted in so brutal a fashion, would have done far more to exalt me in the eyes of the lady of the house than it would have prejudiced her against me. But even if I had been capable of understanding that the mission which M. de Norpois did not perform must have remained futile, nay, more than that, might even have damaged my credit with the Swanns, I should not have had the courage, had he shewn himself consenting, to release the Ambassador from it, and to renounce the pleasure — however fatal its consequences might prove — of feeling that my name and my person were thus brought for a moment into Gilberte’s presence, in her unknown life and home

    After M. de Norpois had gone my father cast an eye over the evening paper; I dreamed once more of Berma. The pleasure which I had found in listening to her required to be made complete, all the more because it had fallen far short of what I had promised myself; and so it at once assimilated everything that was capable of giving it nourishment, those merits, for uir stance, which M. de Norpois had admitted that Berma possessed, and which my mind had absorbed at one draught, like a dry lawn when water is poured on it. Then my father handed me the newspaper, pointing me out a paragraph which ran more or less as follows:—-

    The performance of Phèdre, given this afternoon before an enthusiastic audience, which included the foremost representatives of society and the arts, as well as the principal critics, was for Mme. Berma, who played the heroine, the occasion of a triumph as brilliant as any that she has known in the course of her phenomenal career. We shall discuss more fully in a later issue this performance, which is indeed an event in the history of the stage; for the present we need only add that the best qualified judges are unanimous in the pronouncement that such an interpretation sheds an entirely new light on the part of Phèdre, which is one of the finest and most studied of Racine’s creations, and that it constitutes the purest and most exalted manifestation of dramatic art which it has been the privilege of our generation to witness

    Immediately my mind had conceived this new idea of “the purest and most exalted manifestation of dramatic art,” it, the idea, sped to join the imperfect pleasure which I had felt in the theatre, added to it a little of what was lacking, and their combination formed something so exalting that I cried out within myself: “What a great artist!” It may doubtless be argued that I was not absolutely sincere. But let us bear in mind, rather, the numberless writers who, dissatisfied with the page which they have just written, if they read some eulogy of the genius of Chateaubriand, or evoke the spirit of some great artist whose equal they aspire to be, by humming to themselves, for instance, a phrase of Beethoven, the melancholy of which they compare with what they have been trying to express in prose, are so filled with that idea of genius that they add it to their own productions, when they think of them once again, see them no longer in the light in which at first they appeared, and, hazarding an act of faith in the value of their work, say to themselves: “After all!” without taking into account that, into the total which determines their ultimate satisfaction, they have introduced the memory of marvellous pages of Chateaubriand which they assimilate to their own, but of which, in cold fact, they are not the authors; let us bear in mind the numberless men who believe in the love of a mistress on the evidence only of her betrayals; all those, too, who are sustained by the alternative hopes, either of an incomprehensible survival of death, when they think, inconsolable husbands, of the wives whom they have lost but have not ceased to love, or, artists, of the posthumous glory which they may thus enjoy; or else the hope of complete extinction which comforts them when their thoughts turn to the misdeeds that otherwise they must expiate after death; let us bear in mind also the travellers who come home enraptured by the general beauty of a tour of which, from day to day, they have felt nothing but the tedious incidents; and let us then declare whether, in the communal life that is led by our ideas in the enclosure of our minds, there is a single one of those that make us most happy which has not first sought, a very parasite, and won from an alien but neighbouring idea the greater part of the strength that it originally lacked

    My mother appeared none too well pleased that my father no longer thought of ‘the career’ for myself. I fancy that, anxious before all things that a definite rule of life should discipline the eccentricity of my nervous system, what she regretted was not so much seeing me abandon diplomacy as the prospect of my devoting myself to literature. But “Let him alone!” my father protested; “the main thing is that a man should find pleasure in his work. He is no longer a child. He knows pretty well now what he likes, it is not at all probable that he will change, and he is quite capable of deciding for himself what will make him happy in life.” That evening, as I waited for the time to arrive when, thanks to the freedom of choice which they allowed me, I should or should not begin to be happy in life, my father’s words caused me great uneasiness. At all times his unexpected kindnesses had, when they were manifested, prompted in me so keen a desire to kiss, above where his beard began, his glowing cheeks, that if I did not yield to that desire, it was simply because I was afraid of annoying him. And on that day, as an author becomes alarmed when he sees the fruits of his own meditation, which do not appear to him to be of great value since he does not separate them from himself, oblige a publisher to choose a kind of paper, to employ a fount of type finer, perhaps, than they deserve, I asked myself whether my desire to write was of sufficient importance to justify my father in dispensing so much generosity. But apart from that, when he spoke of my inclinations as no longer liable to change, he awakened in me two terrible suspicions. The first was that (at a time when, every day, I regarded myself as standing upon the threshold of a life which was still intact and would not enter upon its course until the following morning) my existence was already begun, and that, furthermore, what was yet to follow would not differ to any extent from what had already elapsed. The second suspicion, which was nothing more, really, than a variant of the first, was that I was not situated somewhere outside the realm of Time, but was subject to its laws, just like the people in novels who, for that reason, used to plunge me in such depression when I read of their lives, down at Combray, in the fastness of my wicker sentry-box. In theory one is aware that the earth revolves, but in practice one does not perceive it, the ground upon which one treads seems not to move, and one can live undisturbed. So it is with Time in one’s life. And to make its flight perceptible novelists are obliged, by wildly accelerating the beat of the pendulum, to transport the reader in a couple of minutes over ten, or twenty, or even thirty years. At the top of one page we have left a lover full of hope; at the foot of the next we meet him again, a bowed old man of eighty, painfully dragging himself on his daily walk about the courtyard of an almshouse, scarcely replying to what is said to him, oblivious of the past. In saying of me, “He is no longer a child,” “His tastes will not change now,” and so forth, my father had suddenly made me apparent to myself in my position in Time, and caused me the same kind of depression as if I had baen, not yet the enfeebled old pensioner, but one of those heroes of whom the author, in a tone of indifference which is particularly galling, says to us at the end of a book: “He very seldom comes up now from the country. He has finally decided to end his days there.”

    Meanwhile my father, so as to forestall any criticism that we might feel tempted to make of our guest, said to my mother: “Upon my word, old Norpois was rather ‘typical,’ as you call it, this evening, wasn’t he? When he said that it would not have been ‘seemly’ to ask the Comte de Paris a question, I was quite afraid you would burst out laughing.”

    “Not at all!” answered my mother. “I was delighted to see a man of his standing, and age too, keep that sort of simplicity, which is really a sign of straightforwardness and good-breeding.”

    “I should think so, indeed! That does not prevent his having a shrewd and discerning mind; I know him well, I see him at the Commission, remember, where he is very different from what he was here,” exclaimed my father, who was glad to see that Mamma appreciated M. de Norpois, and anxious to persucde her that he was even superior to what she supposed, because a cordial nature exaggerates a friend’s qualities with as much pleasure as a mischievous one finds in depreciating them. “What was it that he said, again —‘With Princes one never does know.’ . . .?”

    “Yes, that was it. I noticed it at the time; it was very neat. You can see that he has a vast experience of life.”

    “The astonishing thing is that he should have been dining with the Swanns, and that he seems to have found quite respectable people there, officials even. How on earth can Mme. Swann have managed to catch them?”

    “Did you notice the malicious way he said: ‘It is a house which is especially attractive to gentlemen!’?”

    And each of them attempted to reproduce the manner in which M. de Norpois had uttered these words, as they might have attempted to capture some intonation of Bressant’s voice or of Thiron’s in L’Aventurière or in theGendre de M. Poirier. But of all his sayings there was none so keenly relished as one was by Françoise, who, years afterwards, even, could not ‘keep a straight face’ if we reminded her that she had been qualified by the Ambassador as ‘a chef of the first order,’ a compliment which my mother had gone in person to transmit to her, as a War Minister publishes the congratulations addressed to him by a visiting Sovereign after the grand review. I, as it happened, had preceded my mother to the kitchen. For I had extorted from Françoise, who though opposed to war was cruel, that she would cause no undue suffering to the rabbit which she had to kill, and I had had no report yet of its death. Françoise assured me that it had passed away as peacefully as could be desired, and very swiftly. “I have never seen a beast like it; it died without uttering a word; you would have thought it was dumb.” Being but little versed in the language of beasts I suggested that the rabbit had not, perhaps, a cry like the chicken’s. “Just wait till you see,” said Françoise, filled with contempt for my ignorance, “if rabbits don’t cry every bit as much as chickens. Why, they are far noisier.” She received the compliments of M. de Norpois with the proud simplicity, the joyful and (if but for the moment) intelligent expression of an artist when someone speaks to him of his art. My mother had sent her when she first came to us to several of the big restaurants to see how the cooking there was done. I had the same pleasure, that evening, in hearing her dismiss the most famous of them as mere cookshops that I had had long ago, when I learned with regard to theatrical artists that the hierarchy of their merits did not at all correspond to that of their reputations. “The Ambassador,” my mother told her, “assured me that he knows no place where he can get cold beef and soufflés as good as yours.” Françoise, with an air of modesty and of paying just homage to the truth, agreed, but seemed not at all impressed by the title ‘Ambassador’; she said of M. de Norpois, with the friendliness due to a man who had taken her for a chef: “He’s a good old soul, like me.” She had indeed hoped to catch sight of him as he arrived, but knowing that Mamma hated their standing about behind doors and in windows, and thinking that Mamma would get to know from the other servants or from the porter that she had been keeping watch (for Françoise saw everywhere nothing but ‘jealousies’ and ‘tale-bearings,’ which played the same grim and unending part in her imagination as do for others of us the intrigues of the Jesuits or the Jews), she had contented herself with a peep from the kitchen window, ‘so as not to have words with Madame,’ and beneath the momentary aspect of M. de Norpois had ‘thought it was Monsieur Legrand,’ because of what she called his ‘agelity’ and in spite of their having not a single point in common. “Well,” inquired my mother, “and how do you explain that nobody else can make a jelly as well as you — when you choose?” “I really couldn’t say how that becomes about,” replied Françoise, who had established no very clear line of demarcation between the verb ‘to come,’ in certain of its meanings at least, and the verb ‘to become.’ She was speaking the truth, if not the whole truth, being scarcely more capable — or desirous — of revealing the mystery which ensured the superiority of her jellies or her creams than a leader of fashion the secrets of her toilet or a great singer those of her song. Their explanations tell us little; it was the same with the recipes furnished by our cook. “They do it in too much of a hurry,” she went on, alluding to the great restaurants, “and then it’s not all done together. You want the beef to become like a sponge, then it will drink up all the juice to the last drop. Still, there was one of those Cafés where I thought they did know a little bit about cooking. I don’t say it was altogether my jelly, but it was very nicely done, and the soufflés had plenty of cream.” “Do you mean Henry’s?” asked my father (who had now joined us), for he greatly enjoyed that restaurant in the Place Gaillon where he went regularly to club dinners. “Oh, dear no!” said Françoise, with a mildness which cloaked her profound contempt. “I meant a little restaurant. At that Henry’s it’s all very good, sure enough, but it’s not a restaurant, it’s more like a — soup-kitchen.” “Weber’s, then?” “Oh, no, sir, I meant a good restaurant. Weber’s, that’s in the Rue Royale; that’s not a restaurant, it’s a drinking-shop. I don’t know that the food they give you there is even served. I think they don’t have any tablecloths; they just shove it down in front of you like that, with a take it or leave it.” “Giro’s?” “Oh! there I should say they have the cooking done by ladies of the world.” (‘World’ meant for Françoise the under-world.) “Lord! They need that to fetch the boys in.” We could see that, with all her air of simplicity, Françoise was for the celebrities of her profession a more disastrous ‘comrade’ than the most jealous, the most infatuated of actresses. We felt, all the same, that she had a proper feeling for her art and a respect for tradition; for she went on: “No, I mean a restaurant where they looked as if they kept a very good little family table. It’s a place of some consequence, too. Plenty of custom there. Oh, they raked in the coppers there, all right.” Françoise, being an economist, reckoned in coppers, where your plunger would reckon in gold. “Madame knows the place well enough, down there to the right along the main boulevards, a little way back.” The restaurant of which she spoke with this blend of pride and good-humoured tolerance was, it turned out, the Café Anglais

    When New Year’s Day came, I first of all paid a round of family visits with Mamma who, so as not to tire me, had planned them beforehand (with the aid of an itinerary drawn up by my father) according to districts rather than to degrees of kinship. But no sooner had we entered the drawing-room of the distant cousin whose claim to being visited first was that her house was at no distance from ours, than my mother was horrified to see standing there, his present of marrons glacés or déguisés in his hand, the bosom friend of the most sensitive of all my uncles, to whom he would at once go and report that we had not begun our round with him. And this uncle would certainly be hurt; he would have thought it quite natural that we should go from the Madeleine to the Jardin des Plantes, where he lived, before stopping at Saint-Augustin, on our way to the Rue de l’Ecole de Médecine

    Our visits ended (my grandmother had dispensed us from the duty of calling on her, since we were to dine there that evening), I ran all the way to the Champs-Elysées to give to our own special stall-keeper, with instructions to hand it over to the person who came to her several times a week from the Swanns to buy gingerbread, the letter which, on the day when my friend had caused me so much anxiety, I had decided to send her at the New Year, and in which I told her that our old friendship was vanishing with the old year, that I would forget, now, my old sorrows and disappointments, and that, from this first day of January, it was a new friendship that we were going to cement, one so solid that nothing could destroy it, so wonderful that I hoped that Gilberte would go out of her way to preserve it in all its beauty, and to warn me in time, as I promised to warn her, should either of us detect the least sign of a peril that might endanger it. On our way home Françoise made me stop at the corner of the Rue Royale, before an open-air stall from which she selected for her own stock of presents photographs of Pius IX and Raspail, while for myself I purchased one of Berma. The innumerable admiration which that artist excited gave an air almost of poverty to this one face that she had to respond with, unalterable and precarious as are the garments of people who have not a ‘change,’ this face on which she must continually expose to view only the tiny dimple upon her upper lip, the arch of her eyebrows, a few other physical peculiarities always the same, which, when it came to that, were at the mercy of a burn or a blow. This face, moreover, could not in itself have seemed to me beautiful, but it gave me the idea, and consequently the desire to kiss it by reason of all the kisses that it must have received, for which, from its page in the album, it seemed still to be appealing with that coquettishly tender gaze, that artificially ingenuous smile. For our Berma must indeed have felt for many young men those longings which she confessed under cover of the personality of Phaedra, longings of which everything, even the glamour of her name which enhanced her beauty and prolonged her youth, must render the gratification so easy to her. Night was falling; I stopped before a column of playbills, on which was posted that of the piece in which she was to appear on January 1. A moist and gentle breeze was blowing. It was a time of day and year that I knew; I suddenly felt a presentiment that New Year’s Day was not a day different from, the rest, that it was not the first day of a new world, in which, I might, by a chance that had never yet occurred, that was still intact, make Gilberte’s acquaintance afresh, as at the Creation of the World, as though the past had no longer any existence, as though there had been obliterated, with the indications which I might have preserved for my future guidance, the disappointments which she had sometimes brought me; a new world in which nothing should subsist from the old — save one thing, my desire that Gilberte should love me. I realised that if my heart hoped for such a reconstruction, round about it, of a universe that had not satisfied it before, it was because my heart had not altered, and I told myself that there was no reason why Gilberte’s should have altered either; I felt that this new friendship was the same, just as there is no boundary ditch between their forerunners and those new years which our desire for them, without being able to reach and so to modify them, invests, unknown to themselves, with distinctive names. I might dedicate this new year, if I chose, to Gilberte, and as one bases a religious system upon the blind laws of nature, endeavour to stamp New Year’s Day with the particular image that I had formed of it; but in vain, I felt that it was not aware that people called it New Year’s Day, that it was passing in a wintry dusk in a manner that was not novel to me; in the gentle breeze that floated about the column of playbills I had recognised, I had felt reappear the eternal, the universal substance, the familiar moisture, the unheeding fluidity of the old days and years

    I returned to the house. I had spent the New Year’s Day of old men, who differ on that day from their juniors, not because people have ceased to give them presents but because they themselves have ceased to believe in the New Year. Presents I had indeed received, but not that present which alone could bring me pleasure, namely a line from Gilberte. I was young still, none the less, since I had been able to write her one, by means of which I hoped, in telling her of my solitary dreams of love and longing, to arouse similar dreams in her. The sadness of men who have grown old lies in their no longer even thinking of writing such letters, the futility of which their experience has shewn

    After I was in bed, the noises of the street, unduly prolonged upon this festive evening, kept me awake. I thought of all the people who were ending the night in pleasure, of the lover, the troop, it might be, of debauchees who would be going to meet Berma at the stage-door after the play that I had seen announced for this evening. I was not even able, so as to calm the agitation which that idea engendered in me during my sleepless night, to assure myself that Berma was not, perhaps, thinking about love, since the lines that she was reciting, which she had long and carefully rehearsed, reminded her at every moment that love is an exquisite thing, as of course she already knew, and knew so well that she displayed its familiar pangs — only enriched with a new violence and an unsuspected sweetness — to her astonished audience; and yet each of them had felt those pangs himself. I lighted my candle again, to look once more upon her face. At the thought that it was, no doubt, at that very moment being caressed by those men whom I could not prevent from giving to Berma and receiving from her joys superhuman but vague, I felt an emotion more cruel than voluptuous, a longing that was aggravated presently by the sound of a horn, as one hears it on the nights of the Lenten carnival and often of other public holidays, which, because it then lacks all poetry, is more saddening, coming from a toy squeaker, than “at evening, in the depth of the woods.” At that moment, a message from Gilberte would perhaps not have been what I wanted. Our desires cut across one another’s paths, and in this confused existence it is but rarely that a piece of good fortune coincides with the desire that clamoured for it

    I continued to go to the Champs-Elysées on fine days, along streets whose stylish pink houses seemed to be washed (because exhibitions of water-colours were then at the height of fashion) in a lightly floating atmosphere. It would be untrue to say that in those days the palaces of Gabriel struck me as being of greater beauty, or even of another epoch than the adjoining houses. I found more style, and should have supposed more antiquity if not in the Palais de l’Industrie at any rate in the Troca-déro. Plunged in a restless sleep, my adolescence embodied in one uniform vision the whole of the quarter through which it might be strolling, and I had never dreamed that there could be an eighteenth century building in the Rue Royale, just as I should have been astonished to learn that the Porte-Saint-Martin and the Porte-Saint-Denis, those glories of the age of Louis XIV, were not contemporary with the most recently built tenements in the sordid regions that bore their names. Once only one of Gabriel’s palaces made me stop for more than a moment; that was because, night having fallen, its columns, dematerialised by the moonlight, had the appearance of having been cut out in pasteboard, and by recalling to me a scene in the operetta Orphée aux Enfers gave me for the first time an impression of beauty

    Meanwhile Gilberte never came to the Champs-Elysées. And yet it was imperative that I should see her, for I could not so much as remember what she was like. The questing, anxious, exacting way that we have of looking at the person we love, our eagerness for the word which shall give us or take from us the hope of an appointment for the morrow, and, until that word is uttered, our alternative if not simultaneous imaginings of joy and of despair, all these make our observation, in the beloved object’s presence, too tremulous to be able to carry away a clear impression of her. Perhaps, also, that activity of all the senses at once which endeavours to learn from the visible aspect alone what lies behind it is over-indulgent to the thousand forms, to the changing fragrance, to the movements of the living person whom as a rule, when we are not in love, we regard as fixed in one permanent position. Whereas the beloved model does not stay still; and our mental photographs of her are always blurred. I did not rightly know how Gilberte’s features were composed, save in the heavenly moments when she disclosed them to me; I could remember nothing but her smile. And not being able to see again that beloved face, despite every effort that I might make to recapture it, I would be disgusted to find, outlined in my memory with a maddening precision of detail, the meaningless, emphatic faces of the man with the wooden horses and of the barley-sugar woman; just as those who have lost a dear friend whom they never see even while they are asleep, are exasperated at meeting incessantly in their dreams any number of insupportable creatures whom it is quite enough to have known in the waking world. In their inability to form any image of the object of their grief they are almost led to assert that they feel no grief. And I was not far from believing that, since I could not recall the features of Gilberte, I had forgotten Gilberte herself, and no longer loved her. At length she returned to play there almost every day, setting before me fresh pleasures to desire, to demand of her for the morrow, indeed making my love for her every day, in this sense, a new love. But an incident was to change once again, and abruptly, the manner in which, at about two o’clock every afternoon, the problem of my love confronted me. Had M. Swann intercepted the letter that I had written to his daughter, or was Gilberte merely confessing to me long after the event, and so that I should be more prudent in future, a state of things already long established? As I was telling her how greatly I admired her father and mother, she assumed that vague air, full of reticence and kept secrets, which she invariably wore when anyone spoke to her of what she was going to do, her walks, drives, visits — then suddenly expressed it with: “You know, they can’t abide you!” and, slipping from me like the Undine that she was, burst out laughing. Often her laughter, out of harmony with her words, seemed, as music seems, to be tracing an invisible surface on another plane. M. and Mme. Swann did not require Gilberte to give up playing with me, but they would have been just as well pleased, she thought, if we had never begun. They did not look upon our relations with a kindly eye; they believed me to be a young person of low moral standard and imagined that my influence over their daughter must be evil. This type of unscrupulous young man whom the Swanns thought that I resembled, I pictured him to myself as detesting the parents of the girl he loved, flattering them to their faces but, when he was alone with her, making fun of them, urging her on to disobey them and, when once he had completed his conquest, not allowing them even to set eyes on her again. With these characteristics (though they are never those under which the basest of scoundrels recognises himself) how vehemently did my heart contrast the sentiments that did indeed animate it with regard to Swann, so passionate, on the contrary, that I never doubted that, were he to have the least suspicion of them, he must repent of his condemnation of me as of a judicial error. All that I felt about him I made bold to express to him in a long letter which I entrusted to Gilberte, with the request that she would deliver it. She consented. Alas! so he saw in me an even greater impostor than I had feared; those sentiments which I had supposed myself to be portraying, in sixteen pages, with such amplitude of truth, so he had suspected them; in short, the letter that I had written him, as ardent and as sincere as the words that I had uttered to M. de Norpois, met with no more success. Gilberte told me next day, after taking me aside behind a clump of laurels, along a little path by which we sat down on a couple of chairs, that as he read my letter, which she had now brought back to me, her father had shrugged his shoulders, with: “All this means nothing; it only goes to prove how right I was.” I, who knew the purity of my intentions, the goodness of my soul, was furious that my words should not even have impinged upon the surface of Swann’s ridiculous error. For it was an error; of that I had then no doubt. I felt that I had described with such accuracy certain irrefutable characteristics of my generous sentiments that, if Swann had not at once reconstructed these from my indications, had not come to ask my forgiveness and to admit that he had been mistaken, it must be because these noble sentiments he had never himself experienced, which would make him incapable of understanding the existence of them in other people

    Well, perhaps it was simply that Swann knew that generosity is often no more than the inner aspect which our egotistical feelings assume when we have not yet named and classified them. Perhaps he had recognised in the sympathy that I expressed for him simply an effect — and the strongest possible proof — of my love for Gilberte, by which, and not by any subordinate veneration of himself, my subsequent actions would be irresistibly controlled. I was unable to share his point of view, since I had not succeeded in abstracting my love from myself, in forcing it back into the common experience of humanity, and thus suffering, experimentally, its consequences; I was in despair. I was obliged to leave Gilberte for a moment; Françoise had called me. I must accompany her into a little pavilion covered in a green trellis, not unlike one of the disused toll-houses of old Paris, in which had recently been installed what in England they call a lavatory but in France, by an ill-informed piece of anglomania, ‘water-closets.’ The old, damp walls at the entrance, where I stood waiting for Françoise, emitted a chill and fusty smell which, relieving me at once of the anxieties that Swann’s words, as reported by Gilberte, had just awakened in me, pervaded me with a pleasure not at all of the same character as other pleasures, which leave one more unstable than before, incapable of retaining them, of possessing them, but, on the contrary, with a consistent pleasure on which I could lean for support, delicious, soothing, rich with a truth that was lasting, unexplained and certain. I should have liked, as long ago in my walks along the Guermantes way, to endeavour to penetrate the charm of this impression which had seized hold of me, and, remaining there motionless, to interrogate this antiquated emanation which invited me not to enjoy the pleasure which it was offering me only as an ‘extra,’ but to descend into the underlying reality which it had not yet disclosed to me. But the tenant of the establishment, an elderly dame with painted cheeks and an auburn wig, was speaking to me. Françoise thought her ‘very well-to-do indeed.’ Her ‘missy’ had married what Françoise called ‘a young man of family,’ which meant that he differed more, in her eyes, from a workman than, in Saint-Simon’s, a duke did from a man ‘risen from the dregs of the people.’ No doubt the tenant, before entering upon her tenancy, had met with reverses. But Françoise was positive that she was a ‘marquise,’ and belonged to the Saint-Ferréol family. This ‘marquise’ warned me not to stand outside in the cold, and even opened one of her doors for me, saying: “Won’t you go inside for a minute? Look, here’s a nice, clean one, and I shan’t charge you anything.” Perhaps she just made this offer in the spirit in which the young ladies at Gouache’s, when we went in there to order something, used to offer me one of the sweets which they kept on the counter under glass bells, and which, alas, Mamma would never allow me to take; perhaps with less innocence, like an old florist whom Mamma used to have in to replenish her flower-stands, who rolled languishing eyes at me as she handed me a rose. In any event, if the ‘marquise’ had a weakness for little boys, when she threw open to them the hypogean doors of those cubicles of stone in which men crouch like sphinxes, she must have been moved to that generosity less by the hope of corrupting them than by the pleasure which all of us feel in displaying a needless prodigality to those whom we love, for I have never seen her with any other visitor except an old park-keeper

    A moment later I said good-bye to the ‘marquise,’ and went out accompanied by Françoise, whom I left to return to Gilberte. I caught sight of her at once, on a chair, behind the clump of laurels. She was there so as not to be seen by her friends: they were playing at hide-and-seek. I went and sat down by her side. She had on a flat cap which drooped forwards over her eyes, giving her the same ‘underhand,’ brooding, crafty look which I had remarked in her that first time at Comb ray. I asked her if there was not some way for me to have it out with her father, face to face. Gilberte said that she had suggested that to him, but that he had not thought it of any use. “Look,” she went on, “don’t go away without your letter; I must run along to the others, as they haven’t caught me.”

    Had Swann appeared on the scene then before I had recovered it, this letter, by the sincerity of which I felt that he had been so unreasonable in not letting himself be convinced, perhaps he would have seen that it was he who had been in the right. For as I approached Gilberte, who, leaning back in her chair, told me to take the letter but did not hold it out to me, I felt myself so irresistibly attracted by her body that I said to her: “Look! You try to stop me from getting it; we’ll see which is the stronger.”

    She thrust it behind her back; I put my arms round her neck, raising the plaits of hair which she wore over her shoulders, either because she was still of an age for that or because her mother chose to make her look a child for a little longer so that she herself might still seem young; and we wrestled, locked together. I tried to pull her towards me, she resisted; her cheeks, inflamed by the effort, were as red and round as two cherries; she laughed as though I were tickling her; I held her gripped between my legs like a young tree which I was trying to climb; and, in the middle of my gymnastics, when I was already out of breath with the muscular exercise and the heat of the game, I felt, as it were a few drops of sweat wrung from me by the effort, my pleasure express itself in a form which I could not even pause for a moment to analyse; immediately I snatched the letter from her. Whereupon Gilberte said, good-naturedly:

    “You know, if you like, we might go on wrestling for a little.”

    Perhaps she was dimly conscious that my game had had another object than that which I had avowed, but too dimly to have been able to see that I had attained it. And I, who was afraid that she had seen (and a slight recoil, as though of offended modesty which she made and checked a moment later made me think that my fear had not been unfounded), agreed to go on wrestling, lest she should suppose that I had indeed no other object than that, after which I wished only to sit quietly by her side

    On my way home I perceived, I suddenly recollected the impression, concealed from me until then, towards which, without letting me distinguish or recognise it, the cold, almost sooty smell of the trellised pavilion had borne me. It was that of my uncle Adolphe’s little sitting-room at Combray, which had indeed exhaled the same odour of humidity. But I could not understand, and I postponed the attempt to discover why the recollection of so trivial an impression had given me so keen a happiness. It struck me, however, that I did indeed deserve the contempt of M. de Norpois; I had preferred, hitherto, to all other writers, one whom he styled a mere ‘flute-player’ and a positive rapture had been conveyed to me, not by any important idea, but by a mouldy smell

    For some time past, in certain households, the name of the Champs-Elysées, if a visitor mentioned it, would be greeted by the mother of the family with that air of contempt which mothers keep for a physician of established reputation whom they have (or so they make out) seen make too many false diagnoses to have any faith left in him; people insisted that these gardens were not good for children, that they knew of more than one sore throat, more than one case of measles and any number of feverish chills for which the Champs must be held responsible. Without venturing openly to doubt the maternal affection of Mamma, who continued to let me play there, several of her friends deplored her inability to see what was as plain as daylight

    Neurotic subjects are perhaps less addicted than any, despite the time-honoured phrase, to ‘listening to their insides’: they can hear so many things going on inside themselves, by which they realise later that they did wrong to let themselves be alarmed, that they end by paying no attention to any of them. Their nervous systems have so often cried out to them for help, as though from some serious malady, when it was merely because snow was coming, or because they had to change their rooms, that they have acquired the habit of paying no more heed to these warnings than a soldier who in the heat of battle perceives them so little that he is capable, although dying, of carrying on for some days still the life of a man in perfect health. One morning, bearing arranged within me all my regular disabilities, from whose constant, internal circulation I kept my mind turned as resolutely away as from the circulation of my blood, I had come running into the dining-room where my parents were already at table, and — having assured myself, as usual, that to feel cold may mean not that one ought to warm oneself but that, for instance, one has received a scolding, and not to feel hungry that it is going to rain, and not that one ought not to eat anything — had taken my place between them when, in the act of swallowing the first mouthful of a particularly tempting cutlet, a nausea, a giddiness stopped me, the feverish reaction of a malady that had already begun, the symptoms of which had been masked, retarded by the ice of my indifference, but which obstinately refused the nourishment that I was not in a fit state to absorb. Then, at the same moment, the thought that they would stop me from going out if they saw that I was unwell gave me, as the instinct of self-preservation gives a wounded man, the strength to crawl to my own room, where I found that I had a temperature of 104, and then to get ready to go to the Champs-Elysées. Through the languid and vulnerable shell which encased them, my eager thoughts were urging me towards, were clamouring for the soothing delight of a game of prisoner’s base with Gilberte, and an hour later, barely able to keep on my feet, but happy in being by her side, I had still the strength to enjoy it

    Françoise, on our return, declared that I had been ‘taken bad,’ that I must have caught a ‘hot and cold,’ while the doctor, who was called in at once, declared that he ‘preferred’ the ‘severity,’ the ‘virulence’ of the rush of fever which accompanied my congestion of the lungs, and would be no more than ‘a fire of straw,’ to other forms, more ‘insidious’ and ‘septic.’ For some time now I had been liable to choking fits, and our doctor, braving the disapproval of my grandmother, who could see me already dying a drunkard’s death, had recommended me to take, as well as the caffeine which had been prescribed to help me to breathe, beer, champagne or brandy when I felt an attack coming. These attacks would subside, he told me, in the ‘euphoria’ brought about by the alcohol. I was often obliged, so that my grandmother should allow them to give it to me, instead of dissembling, almost to make a display of my state of suffocation. On the other hand, as soon as I felt an attack coming, never being quite certain what proportions it would assume, I would grow distressed at the thought of my grandmother’s anxiety, of which I was far more afraid than of my own sufferings. But at the same time my body, either because it was too weak to keep those sufferings secret, or because it feared lest, in their ignorance of the imminent disaster, people might demand of me some exertion which it would have found impossible or dangerous, gave me the need to warn my grandmother of my attacks with a punctiliousness into which I finally put a sort of physiological scruple. Did I perceive in myself a disturbing symptom which I had not previously observed, my body was in distress so long as I had not communicated it to my grandmother. Did she pretend to pay no attention, it made me insist. Sometimes I went too far; and that dear face, which was no longer able always to control its emotion as in the past, would allow an expression of pity to appear, a painful contraction. Then my heart was wrung by the sight of her grief; as if my kisses had had power to expel that grief, as if my affection could give my grandmother as much joy as my recovery, I flung myself into her arms. And its scruples being at the same time calmed by the certainty that she now knew the discomfort that I felt, my body offered no opposition to my reassuring her. I protested that this discomfort had been nothing, that I was in no sense to be pitied, that she might be quite sure that I was now happy; my body had wished to secure exactly the amount of pity that it deserved, and, provided that someone knew that it ‘had a pain’ in its right side, it could see no harm in my declaring that this pain was of no consequence and was not an obstacle to my happiness; for my body did not pride itself on its philosophy; that was outside its province. Almost every day during my convalescence I passed through these crises of suffocation. One evening, after my grandmother had left me comparatively well, she returned to my room very late and, seeing me struggling for breath, “Oh, my poor boy,” she exclaimed, her face quivering with sympathy, “you are in dreadful pain.” She left me at once; I heard the outer gate open, and in a little while she came back with some brandy which she had gone out to buy, since there was none in the house. Presently I began to feel better. My grandmother, who was rather flushed, seemed ‘put out’ about something, and her eyes had a look of weariness and dejection

    “I shall leave you alone now, and let you get the good of this improvement,” she said, rising suddenly to go. I detained her, however, for a kiss, and could feel on her cold cheek something moist, but did not know whether it was the dampness of the night air through which she had just passed. Next day, she did not come to my room until the evening, having had, she told me, to go out. I considered that this shewed a surprising indifference to my welfare, and I had to restrain myself so as not to reproach her with it

    As my chokings had persisted long after any congestion remained that could account for them, my parents asked for a consultation with Professor Cottard. It is not enough that a physician who is called in to treat cases of this sort should be learned. Brought face to face with symptoms which may or may not be those of three or four different complaints, it is in the long run his instinct, his eye that must decide with which, despite the more or less similar appearance of them all, he has to deal. This mysterious gift does not imply any superiority in the other departments of the intellect, and a creature of the utmost vulgarity, who admires the worst pictures, the worst music, in whose mind there is nothing out of the common, may perfectly well possess it. In my case, what was physically evident might equally well have been due to nervous spasms, to the first stages of tuberculosis, to asthma, to a toxi-alimentary dyspnoea with renal insufficiency, to chronic bronchitis, or to a complex state into which more than one of these factors entered. Now, nervous spasms required to be treated firmly, and discouraged, tuberculosis with infinite care and with a ‘feeding-up’ process which would have been bad for an arthritic condition such as asthma, and might indeed have been dangerous in a case of toxi-alimentary dyspnoea, this last calling for a strict diet which, in return, would be fatal to a tuberculous patient. But Cottard’s hesitations were brief and his prescriptions imperious. “Purges; violent and drastic purges; milk for some days, nothing but milk. No meat. No alcohol.” My mother murmured that I needed, all the same, to be ‘built up,’ that my nerves were already weak, that drenching me like a horse and restricting my diet would make me worse. I could see in Cottard’s eyes, as uneasy as though he were afraid of missing a train, that he was asking himself whether he had not allowed his natural good-humour to appear. He was trying to think whether he had remembered to put on his mask of coldness, as one looks for a mirror to see whether one has not forgotten to tie one’s tie. In his uncertainty, and, so as, whatever he had done, to put things right, he replied brutally: “I am not in the habit of repeating my instructions. Give me a pen. Now remember, milk! Later on, when we have got the crises and the agrypnia by the throat, I should like you to take a little clear soup, and then a little broth, but always with milk; au lait! You’ll enjoy that, since Spain is all the rage just now; ollé, ollé!” His pupils knew this joke well, for he made it at the hospital whenever he had to put a heart or liver case on a milk diet. “After that, you will gradually return to your normal life. But whenever there is any coughing or choking — purges, injections, bed, milk!” He listened with icy calm, and without uttering a word, to my mother’s final objections, and as he left us without having condescended to explain the reasons for this course of treatment, my parents concluded that it had no bearing on my case, and would weaken me to no purpose, and so they did not make me try it. Naturally they sought to conceal their disobedience from the Professor, and to succeed in this avoided all the houses in which he was likely to be found. Then, as my health became worse, they decided to make me follow out Cottard’s prescriptions to the letter; in three days my ‘rattle’ and cough had ceased, I could breathe freely. Whereupon we realised that Cottard, while finding, as he told us later on, that I was distinctly asthmatic, and still more inclined to ‘imagine things,’ had seen that what was really the matter with me at the moment was intoxication, and that by loosening my liver and washing out my kidneys he would get rid of the congestion of my bronchial tubes and thus give me back my breath, my sleep and my strength. And we realised that this imbecile was a clinical genius. At last I was able to get up. But they spoke of not letting me go any more to the Champs-Elysées. They said that it was because the air there was bad; but I felt sure that this was only a pretext so that I should not see Mlle. Swann, and I forced myself to repeat the name of Gilberte all the time, like the native tongue which peoples in captivity endeavour to preserve among themselves so as not to forget the land that they will never see again. Sometimes my mother would stroke my forehead with her hand, saying: “So little boys don’t tell Mamma their troubles any more?” And Françoise used to come up to me every day with: “What a face, to be sure! If you could just see yourself I Anyone would think there was a corpse in the house.” It is true that, if I had simply had a cold in the head, Françoise would have assumed the same funereal air. These lamentations pertained rather to her ‘class’ than to the state of my health. I could not at the time discover whether this pessimism was due to sorrow or to satisfaction. I decided provisionally that it was social and professional

    One day, after the postman had called, my mother laid a letter upon my bed. I opened it carelessly, since it could not bear the one signature that would have made me happy, the name of Gilberte, with whom I had no relations outside the Champs-Elysées. And lo, at the foot of the page, embossed with a silver seal representing a man’s head in a helmet, and under him a scroll with the device Per viam rectam, beneath a letter written in a large and flowing hand, in which almost every word appeared to be underlined, simply because the crosses of the ‘t’s’ ran not across but over them, and so drew a line beneath the corresponding letters of the word above, it was indeed Gilberte’s signature and nothing else that I saw. But because I knew that to be impossible upon a letter addressed to myself, the sight of it, unaccompanied by any belief in it, gave me no pleasure. For a moment it merely struck an impression of unreality on everything round about me. With lightning rapidity the impossible signature danced about my bed, the fireplace, the four walls. I saw everything sway, as one does when one falls from a horse, and I asked myself whether there was not an existence altogether different from the one I knew, in direct contradiction of it, but itself the true existence, which, being suddenly revealed to me, filled me with that hesitation which sculptors, in representing the Last Judgment, have given to the awakening dead who find themselves at the gates of the next world. “My dear Friend,” said the letter, “I hear that you have been very ill and have given up going to the Champs-Eîysées. I hardly ever go there either because there has been such an enormous lot of illness. But I’m having my friends to tea here every Monday and Friday. Mamma asks me to tell you that it will be a great pleasure to us all if you will come too, as soon as you are well again, and we can have some more nice talks here, just like the Champs-Elysées. Good-bye, dear friend; I hope that your parents will allow you to come to tea very often. With all my kindest regards. GILBERTE.”

    While I was reading these words, my nervous system was receiving, with admirable promptitude, the news that a piece of great good fortune had befallen me. But my mind, that is to say myself, and in fact the party principally concerned, was still in ignorance. Such good fortune, coming from Gilberte, was a thing of which I had never ceased to dream; a thing wholly in my mind, it was, as Leonardo says of painting, cosa mentale. Now, a sheet of paper covered with writing is not a thing that the mind assimilates at once. But as soon as I had finished reading the letter, I thought of it, it became an object of my dreams, became, it also, cosa mentale, and I loved it so much already that every few minutes I must read it, kiss it again. Then at last I was conscious of my happiness

    Life is strewn with these miracles, for which people who are in love can always hope. It is possible that this one had been artificially brought about by my mother who, seeing that for some time past I had lost all interest in life, may have suggested to Gilberte to write to me, just as, when I was little and went first to the sea-side, so as to give me some pleasure in bathing, which I detested because it took away my breath, she used secretly to hand to the man who was to ‘dip’ me marvellous boxes made of shells, and branches of coral, which I believed that I myself had discovered lying at the bottom of the sea. However, with every occurrence which, in our life and among its contrasted situations, bears any relation to love, it is best to make no attempt to understand it, since in so far as these are inexorable, as they are unlooked-for, they appear to be governed by magic rather than by rational laws. When a multi-millionaire — who for all his millions is quite a charming person — sent packing by a poor and unattractive woman with whom he has been living, calls to his aid, in his desperation, all the resources of wealth, and brings every worldly influence to bear without succeeding in making her take him back, it is wiser for him, in the face of the implacable obstinacy of his mistress, to suppose that Fate intends to crush him, and to make him die of an affection of the heart, than to seek any logical explanation. These obstacles, against which lovers have to contend, and which their imagination, over-excited by suffering, seeks in vain to analyse, are contained, as often as not, in some peculiar characteristic of the woman whom they cannot bring back to themselves, in her stupidity, in the influence acquired over her, the fears suggested to her by people whom the lover does not know, in the kind of pleasures which, at the moment, she is demanding of life, pleasures which neither her lover nor her lover’s wealth can procure for her. In any event, the lover is scarcely in a position to discover the nature of these obstacles, which her woman’y cunning hides from him and his own judgment, falsified by love, prevents him from estimating exactly. They may be compared with those tumours which the doctor succeeds in reducing, but without having traced them to their source. Like them these obstacles remain mysterious but are temporary. Only they last, as a rule, longer than love itself. And as that is not a disinterested passion, the lover who is no longer in love does not seek to know why the woman, neither rich nor virtuous, with whom he was in love refused obstinately for years to let him continue to keep her

    Now the same mystery which often veils from our eyes the reason for a catastrophe, when love is in question, envelops just as frequently the suddenness of certain happy solutions, such as had come to me with Gilberte’s letter. Happy, or at least seemingly happy, for there are few solutions that can really be happy when we are dealing with a sentiment of such a kind that every satisfaction which we can bring to it does no more, as a rule, than dislodge some pain. And yet sometimes a respite is granted us, and we have for a little while the illusion that we are healed

    So far as concerns this letter, at the foot of which Françoise declined to recognise Gilberte’s name, because the elaborate capital ‘G’ leaning against the undotted ‘i’ looked more like an ‘A,’ while the final syllable was indefinitely prolonged by a waving flourish, if we persist in looking for a rational explanation of the sudden reversal of her attitude towards me which it indicated, and which made me so radiantly happy, we may perhaps find that I was to some extent indebted for it to an incident which I should have supposed, on the contrary, to be calculated to ruin me for ever in the sight of the Swann family. A short while back, Bloch had come to see me at a time when Professor Cottard, whom, now that I was following his instructions, we were again calling in, happened to be in my room. As his examination of me was over, and he was sitting with me simply as a visitor because my parents had invited him to stay to dinner, Bloch was allowed to come in. While we were all talking, Bloch having mentioned that he had heard it said that Mme. Swann was very fond of me, by a lady with whom he had been dining the day before, who was herself very intimate with Mme. Swann, I should have liked to reply that he was most certainly mistaken, and to establish the fact (from the same scruple of conscience that had made me proclaim it to M. de Norpois, and for fear of Mme. Swann’s taking me for a liar) that I did not know her and had never spoken to her. But I had not the courage to correct Bloch’s mistake, because I could see quite well that it was deliberate, and that, if he invented something that Mme. Swann could not possibly have said, it was simply to let us know (what he considered flattering to himself, and was not true either) that he had been dining with one of that lady’s friends. And so it fell out that, whereas M. de Norpois, on learning that I did not know but would very much like to know Mme. Swann, had taken great care to avoid speaking to her about me, Cottard, who was her doctor also, having gathered from what he had heard Bloch say that she knew me quite well and thought highly of me, concluded that to remark, when next he saw her, that I was a charming young fellow and a great friend of his could not be of the smallest use to me and would be of advantage to himself, two reasons which made him decide to speak of me to Odette whenever an opportunity arose

    Thus at length I found my way into that abode from which was wafted even on to the staircase the scent that Mme. Swann used, though it was embalmed far more sweetly still by the peculiar, disturbing charm that emanated from the life of Gilberte. The implacable porter, transformed into a benevolent Eumenid, adopted the custom, when I asked him if I might go upstairs, of indicating to me, by raising his cap with a propitious hand, that he gave ear to my prayer. Those windows which, seen from outside, used to interpose between me and the treasures within, which were not intended for me, a polished, distant and superficial stare, which seemed to me the very stare of the Swanns themselves, it fell to my lot, when in the warm weather I had spent a whole afternoon with Gilberte in her room, to open them myself, so as to let in a little air, and even to lean over the sill of one of them by her side, if it was her mother’s ‘at home’ day, to watch the visitors arrive who would often, raising their heads as they stepped out of their carriages, greet me with a wave of the hand, taking me for some nephew of their hostess. At such moments Gilberte’s plaits used to brush my cheek. They seemed to me, in the fineness of their grain, at once natural and supernatural, and in the strength of their constructed tracery, a matchless work of art, in the composition of which had been used the very grass of Paradise. To a section of them, even infinitely minute, what celestial herbary would I not have given as a reliquary. But since I never hoped to obtain an actual fragment of those plaits, if at least I had been able to have their photograph, how far more precious than one of a sheet of flowers traced by Vinci’s pencil! To acquire one of these, I stooped — with friends of the Swanns, and even with photographers — to servilities which did not procure for me what I wanted, but tied me for life to a number of extremely tiresome people

    Gilberte’s parents, who for so long had prevented me from seeing her, now — when I entered the dark hall in which hovered perpetually, more formidable and more to be desired than, at Versailles of old, the apparition of the King, the possibility of my encountering them, in which too, invariably, after butting into an enormous hat-stand with seven branches, like the Candlestick in Holy Writ, I would begin bowing confusedly before a footman, seated among the skirts of his long grey coat upon the wood-box, whom in the dim light I had mistaken for Mme. Swann — Gilberte’s parents, if one of them happened to be passing at the moment of my arrival, so far from seeming annoyed would come and shake hands with a smile, and say:

    “How d’e do?” (They both pronounced it in the same clipped way, which, you may well imagine, once I was back at home, I made an incessant and delightful practice of copying.) “Does Gilberte know you’re here? She does? Then I’ll leave you to her.”

    Better still, the tea-parties themselves to which Gilberte invited her friends, parties which for so long had seemed to me the most insurmountable of the barriers heaped up between her and myself, became now an opportunity for uniting us of which she would inform me in a few lines, written (because I was still a comparative stranger) upon sheets that were always different. One was adorned with a poodle embossed in blue, above a fantastic inscription in English with an exclamation mark after it; another was stamped with an anchor, or with the monogram G. S. preposterously elongated in a rectangle which ran from top to bottom of the page, or else with the name Gilberte, now traced across one corner in letters of gold which imitated my friend’s signature and ended in a flourish, beneath an open umbrella printed in black, now enclosed in a monogram in the shape of a Chinaman’s hat, which contained all the letters of the word in capitals without its being possible to make out a single one of them. At last, as the series of different writing-papers which Gilberte possessed, numerous as it might be, was not unlimited, after a certain number of weeks I saw reappear the sheet that bore (like the first letter she had written me) the motto Per vaim rectam, and over it the man’s head in a helmet, set in a medallion of tarnished silver. And each of them was chosen, on one day rather than another, by virtue of a certain ritual, as I then supposed, but more probably, as I now think, because she tried to remember which of them she had already used, so as never to send the same one twice to any of her correspondents, of those at least whom she took special pains to please, save at the longest possible intervals. As, on account of the different times of their lessons, some of the friends whom Gilberte used to invite to her parties were obliged to leave just as the rest were arriving, while I was still on the stairs I could hear escaping from the hall a murmur of voices which, such was the emotion aroused in me by the imposing ceremony in which I was to take part, long before I had reached the landing, broke all the bonds that still held me to my past life, so that I did not even remember that I was to take off my muffler as soon as I felt too hot, and to keep an eye on the clock so as not to be late in getting home. That staircase, besides, aîl of wood, as they were built about that time in certain houses, in keeping with that Henri II style which had for so long been Odette’s ideal though she was shortly to lose interest in it, and furnished with a placard, to which there was no equivalent at home, on which one read the words: “NOTICE. The lift must not be taken downstairs,” seemed to me a thing so marvellous that I told my parents that it was an ancient staircase brought from ever so far away by M. Swann. My regard for the truth was so great that I should not have hesitated to give them this information even if I had known it to be false, for it alone could enable them to feel for the dignity of the Swanns’ staircase the same respect that I felt myself. It was just as, when one is talking to some ignorant person who cannot understand in what the genius of a great physician consists, it is as well not to admit that he does not know how to cure a cold in the head. But since I had no power of observation, since, as a general rule, I never knew either the name or the nature of things that were before my eyes, and could understand only that when they were connected with the Swanns they must be extraordinary, I was by no means certain that in notifying my parents of the artistic value and remote origin of the staircase I was guilty of falsehood. It did not seem certain; but it must have seemed probable, for I felt myself turn very red when my father interrupted me with: “I know those houses; I have been in one; they are all alike; Swann just has several floors in one; it was Berlier built them all.” He added that he had thought of taking a flat in one of them, but that he had changed his mind, finding that they were not conveniently arranged, and that the landings were too dark. So he said; but I felt instinctively that my mind must make the sacrifices necessary to the glory of the Swanns and to my own happiness, and by a stroke of internal authority, in spite of what I had just heard, I banished for ever from my memory, as a good Catholic banishes Renan’s Vie de Jésus, the destroying thought that their house was just an ordinary flat in which we ourselves might have been living

    Meanwhile on those tea-party days, pulling myself up the staircase step by step, reason and memory already cast off like outer garments, and myself no more now than the sport of the basest reflexes, I would arrive in the zone in which the scent of Mme. Swann greeted my nostrils. I felt that I could already behold the majesty of the chocolate cake, encircled by plates heaped with little cakes, and by tiny napkins of grey damask with figures on them, as required by convention but peculiar to the Swanns. But this unalterable and governed whole seemed, like Kant’s necessary universe, to depend on a supreme act of free will. For when we were all together in Gilberte’s little sitting-room, suddenly she would look at the clock and exclaim:

    “I say! It’s getting a long time since luncheon, and we aren’t having dinner till eight. I feel as if I could eat something. What do you say?”

    And she would make us go into the dining-room, as sombre as the interior of an Asiatic Temple painted by Rembrandt, in which an architectural cake, as gracious and sociable as it was imposing, seemed to be enthroned there in any event, in case the fancy seized Gilberte to discrown it of its chocolate battlements and to hew down the steep brown slopes of its ramparts, baked in the oven like the bastions of the palace of Darius. Better still, in proceeding to the demolition of that Babylonitish pastry, Gilberte did not consider only her own hunger; she inquired also after mine, while she extracted for me from the crumbling monument a whole glazed slab jewelled with scarlet fruits, in the oriental styje. She asked me even at what o’clock my parents were dining, as if I still knew, as if the disturbance that governed me had allowed to persist the sensation of satiety or of hunger, the notion of dinner or the picture of my family in my empty memory and paralysed stomach. Alas, its paralysis was but momentary. The cakes that I took without noticing them, a time would come when I should have to digest them. But that time was still remote. Meanwhile Gilberte was making ‘my’ tea. I went on drinking it indefinitely, whereas a single cup would keep me awake for twenty-four hours. Which explains why my mother used always to say: “What a nuisance it is; he can never go to the Swarms’ without coming home ill.” But was I aware even, when I was at the Swanns’, that it was tea that I was drinking? Had I known, I should have taken it just the same, for even supposing that I had recovered for a moment the sense of the present, that would not have restored to me the memory of the past or the apprehension of the future. My imagination was incapable of reaching to the distant tune in which I might have the idea of going to bed, and the need to sleep

    Gilberte’s girl friends were not all plunged in that state of intoxication in which it is impossible to make up one’s mind. Some of them refused tea! Then Gilberte would say, using a phrase highly fashionable that year: “I can see I’m not having much of a success with my tea!” And to destroy more completely any idea of ceremony, she would disarrange the chairs that were drawn up round the table, with: “We look just like a wedding breakfast. Good lord, what fools servants are!”

    She nibbled her cake, perched sideways upon a cross-legged seat placed at an angle to the table. And then, just as though she could have had all those cakes at her disposal without having first asked leave of her mother, when Mme. Swann, whose ‘day’ coincided as a rule with Gilberte’s tea-parties, had shewn one of her visitors to the door, and came sweeping in, a moment later, dressed sometimes in blue velvet, more often in a black satin gown draped with white lace, she would say with an air of astonishment: “I say, that looks good, what you’ve got there. It makes me quite hungry to see you all eating cake.”

    “But, Mamma, do! We invite you!” Gilberte would answer

    ####

    “Thank you, no, my precious; what would my visitors say? I’ve still got Mme. Trombert and Mme. Cottard and Mme. Bontemps; you know dear Mme. Bontemps never pays very short visits, and she has only just come. What would all those good people say if I never went back to them? If no one else calls, I’ll come in again and have a chat with you (which will be far more amusing) after they’ve all gone. I really think I’ve earned a little rest; I have had forty-five different people to-day, and forty-two of them told me about Gérôme’s picture! But you must come alone one of these days,” she turned to me, “and take ‘your’ tea with Gilberte. She will make it for you just as you like it, as you have it in your own little ‘studio,’” she went on, flying off to her visitors, as if it had been something as familiar to me as my own habits (such as the habit that I should have had of taking tea, had I ever taken it; as for my ‘studio,’ I was uncertain whether I had one or not) that I had come to seek in this mysterious world. “When can you come? To-morrow? We will make you ‘toast’ every bit as good as you get at Colombin’s. No? You are horrid!”— for, since she also had begun to form a salon, she had borrowed Mme. Verdurin’s mannerisms, and notably her tone of petulant autocracy. ‘Toast’ being as incomprehensible to me as ‘Colombin’s,’ this further promise could not add to my temptation. It will appear stranger still, now that everyone uses such expressions — and perhaps even at Combray they are creeping in — that I had not at first understood of whom Mme. Swann was speaking when I heard her sing the praises of our old ‘nurse.’ I did not know any English; I gathered, however, as she went on that the word was intended to denote Françoise. I who, in the Champs-Elysées, had been so terrified of the bad impression that she must make, I now learned from Mme. Swann that it was all the things that Gilberte had told them about my ‘nurse’ that had attracted her husband and her to me. “One feels that she is so devoted to you; she must be nice!” (At once my opinion of Françoise was diametrically changed. By the same token, to have a governess equipped with a waterproof and a feather in her hat no longer appeared quite so essential.) Finally I learned from some words which Mme. Swann let fall with regard to Mme. Blatin (whose good nature she recognised but dreaded her visits) that personal relations with that lady would have been of less value to me than I had supposed, and would not in any way have improved my standing with the Swanns

    If I had now begun to explore, with tremors of reverence and joy the faery domain which, against all probability, had opened to me its hitherto locked approaches, this was still only in my capacity as a friend of Gilberte. The kingdom into which I was received was itself contained within another, more mysterious still, in which Swann and his wife led their supernatural existence and towards which they made their way, after taking my hand in theirs, when they crossed the hall at the same moment as myself but in the other direction. But soon I was to penetrate also to the heart of the Sanctuary. For instance, Gilberte might be out when I called, but M. or Mme. Swann was at home. They would ask who had rung, and on being told that it was myself would send out to ask me to come in for a moment and talk to them, desiring me to use in one way or another, and with this or that object in view, my influence over their daughter. I reminded myself of that letter, so complete, so convincing, which I had written to Swann only the other day, and which he had not deigned even to acknowledge. I marvelled at the impotence of the mind, the reason and the heart to effect the least conversion, to solve a single one of those difficulties which, in the sequel, life, without one’s so much as knowing what steps it has taken, so easily unravels. My new position as the friend of Gilberte, endowed with an excellent influence over her, entitling me now to enjoy the same favours as if, having had as a companion at some school where they had always put me at the head of my class the son of a king, I had owed to that accident the right of informal entry into the palace and to audiences in the throne-room, Swann, with an infinite benevolence and as though he were not over-burdened with glorious occupations, would make me go into his library and there let me for an hour on end respond in stammered monosyllables, timid silences broken by brief and incoherent bursts of courage, to utterances of which my emotion prevented me from understanding a single word; would shew me works of art and books which he thought likely to interest me, things as to which I had no doubt, before seeing them, that they infinitely surpassed in beauty anything that the Louvre possessed or the National Library, but at which I found it impossible to look. At such moments I should have been grateful to Swann’s butler, had he demanded from me my watch, my tie-pin, my boots, and made me sign a deed acknowledging him as my heir: in the admirable words of a popular expression of which, as of the most famous epics, we do not know who was the author, although, like those epics, and with all deference to Wolff and his theory, it most certainly had an author, one of those inventive, modest souls such as we come across every year, who light upon such gems as ‘putting a name to a face,’ though their own names they never let us learn, I did not know what I was doing. All the greater was my astonishment, when my visit was prolonged, at finding to what a zero of realisation, to what an absence of happy ending those hours spent in the enchanted dwelling led me. But my disappointment arose neither from the inadequacy of the works of art that were shewn to me nor from the impossibility of fixing upon them my distracted gaze. For it was not the intrinsic beauty of the objects themselves that made it miraculous for me to be sitting in Swann’s library, it was the attachment to those objects — which might have been the ugliest in the world — of the particular feeling, melancholy and voluptuous, which I had for so many years localised in that room and which still impregnated it; similarly the multitude of mirrors, of silver-backed brushes, of altars to Saint Anthony of Padua, carved and painted by the most eminent artists, her friends, counted for nothing in the feeling of my own unworthiness and of her regal benevolence which was aroused in me when Mme. Swann received me for a moment in her own room, in which three beautiful and impressive creatures, her principal and second and third maids, smilingly prepared for her the most marvellous toilets, and towards which, on the order conveyed to me by the footman in knee-breeches that Madame wished to say a few words to me, I would make my way along the tortuous path of a corridor all embalmed, far and near, by the precious essences which exhaled without ceasing from her dressing-room a fragrance exquisitely sweet

    When Mme. Swann had returned to her visitors, we could still hear her talking and laughing, for even with only two people in the room, and as though she had to cope with all the ‘good friends’ at once, she would raise her voice, ejaculate her words, as she had so often in the ‘little clan’ heard its ‘Mistress’ do, at the moments when she ‘led the conversation.’ The expressions which we have borrowed from other people being those which, for a time at least, we are fondest of using, Mme. Swann used to select at one time those which she had learned from distinguished psople whom her husband had not managed to prevent her from getting to know (it was from them that she derived the mannerism which consists in suppressing the article or demonstrative pronoun, in French, before an adjective qualifying a person’s name), at another time others more plebeian (such as “It’s a mere nothing!” the favourite expression of one of her friends), and used to make room for them in all the stories which, by a habit formed among the ‘little clan,’ she loved to tell about people. She would follow these up automatically with, “I do love that story!” or “Do admit, it’s a verygood story!” which came to her, through her husband, from the Guermantes, whom she did not know

    Mme. Swann had left the dining-room, but her husband, who had just returned home, made his appearance among us in turn.’ “Do you know if your mother is alone, Gilberte?” “No, Papa, she has still some people.” “What, still? At seven o’clock! It’s appalling! The poor woman must be absolutely dead. It’s odious.” (At home I had always heard the first syllable of this word pronounced with a long ‘o,’ like ‘ode,’ but M. and Mme. Swann made it short, as in ‘odd.’) “Just think of it; ever since two o’clock this afternoon!” he went on, turning to me. “And Camille tells me that between four and five he let in at least a dozen people. Did I say a dozen? I believe he told me fourteen. No, a dozen; I don’t remember. When I came home I had quite forgotten it was her ‘day,’ and when I saw all those carriages outside the door I thought there must be a wedding in the house. And just now, while I’ve been in the library for a minute, the bell has never stopped ringing; upon my word, it’s given me quite a headache. And are there a lot of them in there still?” “No; only two.” “Who are they, do you know?” “Mme. Cottard and Mme. Bontemps.” “Oh! the wife of the Chief Secretary to the Minister of Posts.” “I know her husband’s a clerk in some Ministry or other, but I don’t know what he does.” Gilberte assumed a babyish manner

    “What’s that? You silly child, you talk as if you were two years old. What do you mean; ‘a clerk in some Ministry or other’ indeed! He is nothing less than Chief Secretary, chief of the whole show, and what’s more — what on earth am I thinking of? Upon my word, I’m getting as stupid as yourself; he is not the Chief Secretary, he’s the Permanent Secretary.”

    “I don’t know, I’m sure; does that mean a lot, being Permanent Secretary?” answered Gilberte, who never let slip an opportunity of displaying her own indifference to anything that gave her parents cause for vanity. (She may, of course, have considered that she only enhanced the brilliance of such an acquaintance by not seeming to attach any undue importance to it.)

    “I should think it did ‘mean a lot’!” exclaimed Swann, who preferred to this modesty, which might have left me in doubt, a more explicit mode of speech. “Why it means simply that he’s the first man after the Minister. In fact, he’s more important than the Minister, because it is he that does all the work. Besides, it appears that he has immense capacity, a man quite of the first rank, a most distinguished individual. He’s an Officer of the Legion of Honour. A delightful man, he is, and very good-looking too.”

    (This man’s wife, incidentally, had married him against everyone’s wishes and advica because he was a ‘charming creature.’ He had, what may be sufficient to constitute a rare and delicate whole, a fair, silky beard, good features, a nasal voice, powerful lungs and a glass eye.)

    “I may tell you,” he added, turning again to me, “that I am greatly amused to see that lot serving in the present Government, because they are Bontemps of the Bontemps-Chenut family, typical old-fashioned middle-class people, reactionary, clerical, tremendously strait-laced. Your grandfather knew quite well — at least by name and by sight he must have known old Chenut, the father, who never tipped the cabmen more than a ha’penny, though he was a rich enough man for those days, and the Baron Bréau-Chenut. All their money went in the Union Générale smash — you’re too young to remember that, of course — and, gad! they’ve had to get it back as best they could.”

    “He’s the uncle of a little girl who used to come to my lessons, in a class a long way below mine, the famous ‘Albertine.’ She’s certain to be dreadfully ‘fast’ when she’s older, but just now she’s the quaintest spectacle.”

    “She is amazing, this daughter of mine. She knows everyone.”

    “I don’t know her. I only used to see her going about, and hear them calling ‘Albertine’ here, and ‘Albertine’ there. But I do know Mme. Bontemps, and I don’t like her much either.”

    “You are quite wrong; she is charming, pretty, intelligent. In fact, she’s quite clever. I shall go in and say how d’e do to her, and ask her if her husband thinks we’re going to have war, and whether we can rely on King Theodosius. He’s bound to know, don’t you think, since he’s in the counsels of the gods.”

    It was not thus that Swann used to talk in days gone by; but which of us cannot call to mind some royal princess of limited intelligence who let herself be carried off by a footman, and then, ten years later, tried to get back into society, and found that people were not very willing to call upon her; have we not found her spontaneously adopting the language of all the old bores, and, when we referred to some duchess who was at the height of fashion, heard her say: “She came to see me only yesterday,” or “I live a very quiet life.” So that it is superfluous to make a study of manners, since we can deduce them all from psychological laws

    The Swanns shared this eccentricity of people who have not many friends; a visit, an invitation, a mere friendly word from some one ever so little prominent were for them events to which they aspired to give full publicity. If bad luck would have it that the Verdurins were in London when Odette gave a rather smart dinner-party, arrangements were made by which some common friend was to ‘cable’ a report to them across the Channel. Even the complimentary letters and telegrams received by Odette the Swanns were incapable of keeping to themselves. They spoke of them to their friends, passed them from hand to hand. Thus the Swanns’ drawing-room reminded one of a seaside hotel where telegrams containing the latest news are posted up on a board

    Still, people who had known the old Swann not merely outside society, as I had known him, but in society, in that Guermantes set which, with certain concessions to Highnesses and Duchesses, was almost infinitely exacting in the matter of wit and charm, from which banishment was sternly decreed for men of real eminence whom its members found boring or vulgar — such people might have been astonished to observe that their old Swann had ceased to be not only discreet when he spoke of his acquaintance, but difficult when he was called upon to enlarge it. How was it that Mme. Bontemps, so common, so ill-natured, failed to exasperate him? How could he possibly describe her as attractive? The memory of the Guermantes set must, one would suppose, have prevented him; as a matter of fact it encouraged him. There was certainly among the Guermantes, as compared with the great majority of groups in society, taste, indeed a refined taste, but also a snobbishness from which there arose the possibility of a momentary interruption in the exercise of that taste. If it were a question of some one who was not indispensable to their circle, of a Minister for Foreign Affairs, a Republican and inclined to be pompous, or of an Academician who talked too much, their taste would be brought to bear heavily against him, Swann would condole with Mme. de Guermantes on having had to sit next to such people at dinner at one of the Embassies, and they would a thousand times rather have a man of fashion, that is to say a man of the Guermantes kind, good for nothing, but endowed with the wit of the Guermantes, some one who was ‘of the same chapel’ as themselves. Only, a Grand Duchess, a Princess of the Blood, should she dine often with Mme. de Guermantes, would soon find herself enrolled in that chapel also, without having any right to be there, without being at all so endowed. But with the simplicity of people in society, from the moment they had her in their houses they went out of their way to find her attractive, since they were unable to say that it was because she was attractive that they invited her. Swann, coming to the rescue of Mme. de Guermantes, would say to her after the Highness had gone: “After all, she’s not such a bad woman; really, she has quite a sense of the comic. I don’t suppose for a moment that she has mastered the Critique of Pure Reason; still, she is not unattractive.” “Oh, I do so entirely agree with you!” the Duchess would respond. “Besides, she was a little frightened of us all; you will see that she can be charming.” “She is certainly a great deal less devastating than Mme. X——” (the wife of the talkative Academician, and herself a remarkable woman) “who quotes twenty volumes at you.” “Oh, but there isn’t any comparison between them.” The faculty of saying such things as these, and of saying them sincerely, Swann had acquired from the Duchess, and had never lost. He made use of it now with reference to the people who came to his house. He forced himself to distinguish, and to admire in them the qualities that every human being will display if we examine him with a prejudice in his favour, and not with the distaste of the nice-minded; he extolled the merits of Mme. Bon-temps, as he had once extolled those of the Princesse de Parme, who must have been excluded from the Guermantes set if there had not been privileged terms of admission for certain Highnesses, and if, when they presented themselves for election, no consideration had indeed been paid except to wit and charm. We have seen already, moreover, that Swann had always an inclination (which he was now putting into practice, only in a more lasting fashion) to exchange his social position for another which, in certain circumstances, might suit him better. It is only people incapable of analysing, in their perception, what at first sight appears indivisible who believe that one’s position is consolidated with one’s person. One and the same man, taken at successive points in his life, will be found to breathe, at different stages on the social ladder, in atmospheres that do not of necessity become more and more refined; whenever, in any period of our existence, we form or re-form associations with a certain environment, and feel that we can move at ease in it and are made comfortable, we begin quite naturally to make ourselves fast to it by putting out roots and tendrils

    In so far as Mme. Bontemps was concerned, I believe also that Swann, in speaking of her with so much emphasis, was not sorry to think that my parents would hear that she had been to see his wife. To tell the truth, in our house the names of the people whom Mme. Swann was gradually getting to know pricked our curiosity more than they aroused our admiration. At the name of Mme. Trombert, my mother exclaimed: “Ah! That’s a new recruit, and one who will bring in others.” And as though she found a similarity between the somewhat summary, rapid and violent manner in which Mme. Swann acquired her friends, as it were by conquest, and a Colonial expedition, Mamma went on to observe: “Now that the Tromberts have surrendered, the neighbouring tribes will not be long in coming in.” If she had passed Mme. Swann in the street, she would tell us when she came home: “I saw Mme. Swann in all her war-paint; she must have been embarking on some triumphant offensive against the Massachutoes, or the Cingalese, or the Tromberts.” And so with all the new people whom I told her that I had seen in that somewhat composite and artificial society, to which they had often been brought with great difficulty and from widely different surroundings, Mamma would at once divine their origin, and, speaking of them as of trophies dearly bought, would say: “Brought back from an Expedition against the so-and-so!”

    As for Mme. Cottard, my father was astonished that Mme. Swann could find anything to be gained by getting so utterly undistinguished a woman to come to her house, and said: “In spite of the Professor’s position, I must say that I cannot understand it.” Mamma, on the other hand, understood quite well; she knew that a great deal of the pleasure which a woman finds in entering a class of society different from that in which she has previously lived would be lacking if she had no means of keeping her old associates informed of those others, relatively more brilliant, with whom she has replaced them. Therefore, she requires an eye-witness who may be allowed to penetrate this new, delicious world (as a buzzing, browsing insect bores its way into a flower) and will then, as the course of her visits may carry her, spread abroad, or so at least one hopes, with the tidings, a latent germ of envy and of wonder. Mme. Cottard, who might have been created on purpose to fill this part, belonged to that special category in a visiting list which Mamma (who inherited certain facets of her father’s turn of mind) used to call the ‘Tell Sparta’ people. Besides — apart from another reason which did not come to our knowledge until many years later — Mme. Swann, in inviting this good-natured, reserved and modest friend, had no need to fear lest she might be introducing into her drawing-room, on her brilliant ‘days,’ a traitor or a rival. She knew what a vast number of homely blossoms that busy worker, armed with her plume and card-case, could visit in a single afternoon. She knew the creature’s power of dissemination, and, basing her calculations upon the law of probability, was led to believe that almost certainly some intimate of the Verdurins would be bound to hear, within two or three days, how the Governor of Paris had left cards upon her, or that M. Verdurin himself would be told how M. Le Hault de Pressagny, the President of the Horse Show, had taken them, Swann and herself, to the King Theodosius gala; she imagined the Verdurins as informed of these two events, both so flattering to herself and of these alone, because the particular materialisations in which we embody and pursue fame are but few in number, by the default of our own minds which are incapable of imagining at one time all the forms which, none the less, we hope — in a general way — that fame will not fail simultaneously to assume for our benefit

    Mme. Swann had, however, met with no success outside what was called the ‘official world.’ Smart women did not go to her house. It was not the presence there of Republican ‘notables’ that frightened them away. In the days of my early childhood, conservative society was to the last degree worldly, and no ‘good’ house would ever have opened its doors to a Republican. The people who lived in such an atmosphere imagined that the impossibility of ever inviting an ‘opportunist’— still more, a ‘horrid radical’— to their parties was something that would endure for ever, like oil-lamps and horse-drawn omnibuses. But, like a kaleidoscope which is every now and then given a turn, society arranges successively in different orders elements which one would have supposed to be immovable, and composes a fresh pattern. Before I had made my first Communion, ladies on the ‘right side’ in politics had had the stupefaction of meeting, while paying calls, a smart Jewess. These new arrangements of the kaleidoscope are produced by what a philosopher would call a ‘change of criterion.’ The Dreyfus case brought about another, at a period rather later than that in which I began to go to Mme. Swann’s, and the kaleidoscope scattered once again its little scraps of colour. Everything Jewish, even the smart lady herself, fell out of the pattern, and various obscure nationalities appeared in its place. The most brilliant drawing-room in Paris was that of a Prince who was an Austrian and ultra-Catholic. If instead of the Dreyfus case there had come a war with Germany, the base of the kaleidoscope would have been turned in the other direction, and its pattern reversed. The Jews having shewn, to the general astonishment, that they were patriots also, would have kept their position, and no one would have cared to go any more, or even to admit that he had ever gone to the Austrian Prince’s. All this does not, however, prevent the people who move in it from imagining, whenever society is stationary for the moment, that no further change will occur, just as in spite of having witnessed the birth of the telephone they decline to believe in the aeroplane. Meanwhile the philosophers of journalism are at work, castigating the preceding epoch, and not only the kind of pleasures in which it indulged, which seem to them to be the last word in corruption, but even the work of its artists and philosophers, which have no longer the least value in their eyes, as though they were indissolubly linked to the successive moods of fashionable frivolity. The one thing that does not change is that at any and every time it appears that there have been ‘great changes.’ At the time when I went to Mme. Swann’s the Dreyfus storm had not yet broken, and some of the more prominent Jews were extremely powerful. None more so than Sir Rufus Israels, whose wife, Lady Israels, was Swann’s aunt. She had not herself any intimate acquaintance so distinguished as her nephew’s, while he, since he did not care for her, had never much cultivated her society, although he was, so far as was known, her heir. But she was the only one of Swann’s relatives who had any idea of his social position, the others having always remained in the state of ignorance, in that respect, which had long been our own. When, from a family circle, one of its members emigrates into ‘high society’— which to him appears a feat without parallel until after the lapse of a decade he observes that it has been performed in other ways and for different reasons by more than one of the men whom he knew as boys — he draws round about himself a zone of shadow, a terra incognita, which is clearly visible in its minutest details to all those who inhabit it with him, but is darkest night and nothingness to those who may not penetrate it but touch its fringe without the least suspicion of its existence in their midst. There being no news agency to furnish Swann’s lady cousins with intelligence of the people with whom he consorted, it was (before his appalling marriage, of course) with a smile of condescension that they would tell one another, over family dinner-tables, that they had spent a ‘virtuous’ Sunday in going to see ‘cousin Charles,’ whom (regarding him as a ‘poor relation’ who was inclined to envy their prosperity,) they used wittily to name, playing upon the title of Balzac’s story, Le Cousin Bête. Lady Israels, however, was letter-perfect in the names and quality of the people who lavished upon Swann a friendship of which she was frankly jealous. Her husband’s family, which almost equalled the Rothschilds in importance, had for several generations managed the affairs of the Orleans Princes. Lady Israels, being immensely rich, exercised a wide influence, and had employed it so as to ensure that no one whom she knew should be ‘at home’ to Odette. One only had disobeyed her, in secret, the Comtesse de Marsantes. And then, as ill luck would have it, Odette having gone to call upon Mme. de Marsantes, Lady Israels had entered the room almost at her heels. Mme. de Marsantes was on tenter-hooks. With the craven impotence of those who are at liberty to act as they choose, she did not address a single word to Odette, who thus found little encouragement to press further the invasion of a world which, moreover, was not at all that into which she would have liked to be welcomed. In this complete detachment of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, Odette continued to be regarded as the illiterate ‘light woman,’ utterly different from the respectable ladies, ‘well up’ in all the minutest points of genealogy, who endeavoured to quench by reading biographies and memoirs their thirst for the aristocratic relations with which real life had omitted to provide them. And Swann, for his part, continued no doubt to be the lover in whose eyes all these peculiarities of an old mistress would appear lovable or at least inoffensive, for I have often heard his wife profess what were really social heresies, without his attempting (whether from lingering affection for her, loss of regard for society or weariness of the effort to make her perfect) to correct them. It was perhaps also another form of the simplicity which for so long had misled us at Combray, and which now had the effect that, while he continued to know, on his own account at least, many highly distinguished people, he did not make a point, in conversation in his wife’s drawing-room, of our seeming to feel that they were of the smallest importance. They had, indeed, less than ever for Swann, the centre of gravity of his life having been displaced. In any case, Odette’s ignorance of social distinctions was so dense that if the name of the Princesse de Guermantes were mentioned in conversation after that of the Duchess, her cousin, “So those ones are Princes, are they?” she would exclaim; “Why, they’ve gone up a step.” Were anyone to say “the Prince,” in speaking of the Duc de Chartres, she would put him right with, “The Duke, you mean; he is Duc de Chartres, not Prince.” As for the Duc d’Orléans, son of the Comte de Paris: “That’s funny; the son is higher than the father!” she would remark, adding, for she was afflicted with anglomania, “ThoseRoyalties are so dreadfully confusing!”— while to someone who asked her from what province the Guermantes family came she replied, “From the Aisne.”

    But, so far as Odette was concerned, Swann was quite blind, not merely to these deficiencies in her education but to the general mediocrity of her intelligence. More than that; whenever Odette repeated a silly story Swann would sit listening to his wife with a complacency, a merriment, almost an admiration into which some survival of his desire for her must have entered; while in the same conversation, anything subtle, anything deep even that he himself might say would be listened to by Odette with an habitual lack of interest, rather curtly, with impatience, and would at times be sharply contradicted. And we must conclude that this enslavement of refinement by vulgarity is the rule in many households, when we think, conversely, of all the superior women who yield to the blandishments of a boor, merciless in his censure of their most delicate utterances, while they go into ecstasies, with the infinite indulgence of love, over the feeblest of his witticisms. To return to the reasons which prevented Odette, at this period, from making her way into the Faubourg Saint-Germain, it must be observed that the latest turn of the social kaleidoscope had been actuated by a series of scandals. Women to whose houses one had been going with entire confidence had been discovered to be common prostitutes, if not British spies. One would, therefore, for some time to come expect people (so, at least, one supposed) to be, before anything else, in a sound position, regular, settled, accountable. Odette represented simply everything with which one had just severed relations, and was incidentally to renew them at once (for men, their natures not altering from day to day, seek in every new order a continuance of the old) but to renew them by seeking it under another form which would allow one to be innocently taken in, and to believe that it was no longer the same society as before the disaster. However, the scapegoats of that society and Odette were too closely alike. People who move in society are very short-sighted; at the moment in which they cease to have any relations with the Israelite ladies whom they have known, while they are asking themselves how they are to fill the gap thus made in their lives, they perceive, thrust into it as by the windfall of a night of storm, a new lady, an Israelite also; but by virtue of her novelty she is not associated in their minds with her predecessors, with what they are convinced that they must abjure. She does not ask that they shall respect her God. They take her up. There was no question of anti-semitism at the time when I used first to visit Odette. But she was like enough to it to remind people of what they wished, for a while, to avoid

    As for Swann himself, he was still a frequent visitor of several of his former acquaintance, who, of course, were all of the very highest rank. And yet when he spoke to us of the people whom he had just been to see I noticed that, among those whom he had known in the old days, the choice that he made was dictated by the same kind of taste, partly artistic, partly historic, that inspired him as a collector. And remarking that it was often some great lady or other of waning reputation, who interested him because she had been the mistress of Liszt or because one of Balzac’s novels was dedicated to her grandmother (as he would purchase a drawing if Chateaubriand had written about it) I conceived a suspicion that we had, at Combray, replaced one error, that of regarding Swann as a mere stockbroker, who did not go into society, by another, when we supposed him to be one of the smartest men in Paris. To be a friend of the Comte de Paris meant nothing at all. Is not the world full of such ‘friends of Princes,’ who would not be received in any house that was at all ‘exclusive’? Princes know themselves to be princes, and are not snobs; besides, they believe themselves to be so far above everything that is not of their blood royal that great nobles and ‘business men’ appear, in the depths beneath them, to be practically on a level

    But Swann went farther than this; not content with seeking in society, such as it was, when he fastened upon the names which, inscribed upon its roll by the past, were still to be read there, a simple artistic and literary pleasure, he indulged in the slightly vulgar diversion of arranging as it were social nosegays by grouping heterogeneous elements, bringing together people taken at hazard, here, there and everywhere. These experiments in the lighter side (or what was to Swann the lighter side) of sociology did not stimulate an identical reaction, with any regularity, that is to say, in each of his wife’s friends. “I’m thinking of asking the Cottards to meet the Duchesse de Vendôme,” he would laughingly say to Mme. Bontemps, in the appetised tone of an epicure who has thought of, and intends to try the substitution, in a sauce, of cayenne pepper for cloves. But this plan, which was, in fact, to appear quite humorous, in an archaic sense of the word, to the Cottards, had also the power of infuriating Mme. Bontemps. She herself had recently been presented by the Swanns to the Duchesse de Vendôme, and had found this as agreeable as it seemed to her natural. The thought of winning renown from it at the Cottards’, when she related to them what had happened, had been by no means the least savoury ingredient of her pleasure. But like those persons recently decorated who, their investiture once accomplished, would like to see the fountain of honour turned off at the main, Mme. Bontemps would have preferred that, after herself, no one else in her own circle of friends should be made known to the Princess. She denounced (to herself, of course) the licentious taste of Swann who, in order to gratify a wretched aesthetic whim, was obliging her to scatter to the winds, at one swoop, all the dust that she would have thrown in the eyes of the Cottards when she told them about the Duchesse de Vendôme. How was she even to dare to announce to her husband that the Professor and his wife were in their turn to partake of this pleasure, of which she had boasted to him as though it were unique. And yet, if the Cottards could only be made to know that they were being invited not seriously but for the amusement of their host! It is true that the Bontemps had been invited for the same reason, but Swann, having acquired from the aristocracy that eternal ‘Don Juan’ spirit which, in treating with two women of no importance, makes each of them believe that it is she alone who is seriously loved, had spoken to Mme. Bontemps of the Duchesse de Vendôme as of a person whom it was clearly laid down that she must meet at dinner. “Yes, we’re determined to have the Princess here with the Cottards,” said Mme. Swann a few weeks later; “My husband thinks that we might get something quite amusing out of that conjunction.” For if she had retained from the ‘little nucleus’ certain habits dear to Mme. Verdurin, such as that of shouting things aloud so as to be heard by all the faithful, she made use, at the same time, of certain expressions, such as ‘conjunction,’ which were dear to the Guermantes circle, of which she thus felt unconsciously and at a distance, as the sea is swayed by the moon, the attraction, though without being drawn perceptibly closer to it. “Yes, the Cottards and the Duchesse de Vendôme. Don’t you think that might be rather fun?” asked Swann. “I think they’ll be exceedingly ill-assorted, and it can only lead to a lot of bother; people oughtn’t to play with fire, is what I say!” snapped Mme. Bontemps, furious. She and her husband were, all the same, invited, as was the Prince d’Agrigente, to this dinner, which Mme. Bontemps and Cottard had each two alternative ways of describing, according to whom they were telling about it. To one set Mme. Bontemps for her part, and Cottard for his would say casually, when asked who else had been of the party: “Only the Prince d’Agrigente; it was all quite intimate.” But there were others who might, alas, be better informed (once, indeed, some one had challenged Cottard with: “But weren’t the Bontemps there too?” “Oh, I forgot them,” Cottard had blushingly admitted to the tactless questioner whom he ever afterwards classified among slanderers and speakers of evil). For these the Bontemps and Cottards had each adopted, without any mutual arrangement, a version the framework of which was identical for both parties, their own names alone changing places. “Let me see;” Cottard would say, “there were our host and hostess, the Due and Duchesse de Vendôme —” (with a satisfied smile) “Professor and Mme. Cottard, and, upon my soul, heaven only knows how they got there, for they were about as much in keeping as hairs in the soup, M. and Mme. Bontemps!” Mme. Bontemps would recite an exactly similar ‘piece,’ only it was M. and Mme. Bontemps who were named with a satisfied emphasis between the Duchesse de Vendôme and the Prince d’Agrigente, while the ‘also ran,’ whom finally she used to accuse of having invited themselves, and who completely spoiled the party, were the Cottards

    When he had been paying calls Swann would often come home with little time to spare before dinner. At that point in the evening, six o’clock, when in the old days he had felt so wretched, he no longer asked himself what Odette might be about, and was hardly at all concerned to hear that she had people still with her, or had gone out. He recalled at times that he had once, years ago, tried to read through its envelope a letter addressed by Odette to Forcheville. But this memory was not pleasing to him, and rather than plumb the depth of shame that he felt in it he preferred to indulge in a little grimace, twisting up the corners of his mouth and adding, if need be, a shake of the head which signified “What does it all matter?” In truth, he considered now that the hypothesis by which he had often been brought to a standstill in days gone by, according to which it was his jealous imagination alone that blackened what was in reality the innocent life of Odette — that this hypothesis (which after all was beneficent, since, so long as his amorous malady had lasted, it had diminished his sufferings by making them seem imaginary) was not the truth, that it was his jealousy that had seen things in the right light, and that if Odette had loved him better than he supposed, she had deceived him more as well. Formerly, while his sufferings were still keen, he had vowed that, as soon as he should have ceased to love Odette, and so to be afraid either of vexing her or of making her believe that he loved her more than he did, he would afford himself the satisfaction of elucidating with her, simply from his love of truth and as a historical point, whether or not she had had Forcheville in her room that day when he had rung her bell and rapped on her window without being let in, and she had written to Forcheville that it was an uncle of hers who had called. But this so interesting problem, of which he was waiting to attempt the solution only until his jealousy should have subsided, had precisely lost all interest in Swann’s eyes when he had ceased to be jealous. Not immediately, however. He felt no other jealousy now with regard to Odette than what the memory of that day, that afternoon spent in knocking vainly at the little house in the Rue La Pérouse, had continued to excite in him; as though his jealousy, not dissimilar in that respect from those maladies which appear to have their seat, their centre of contagion less in certain persons than in certain places, in certain houses, had had for its object not so much Odette herself as that day, that hour in the irrevocable past when Swann had beaten at every entrance to her house in turn. You would have said that that day, that hour alone had caught and preserved a few last fragments of the amorous personality which had once been Swann’s, and that there alone could he now recapture them. For a long time now it had made no matter to him that Odette had been false to him, and was false still. And yet he had continued for some years to seek out old servants of Odette, so strongly in him persisted the painful curiosity to know whether on that day, so long ago, at six o’clock, Odette had been in bed with Forcheville. Then that curiosity itself had disappeared, without, however, his abandoning his investigations. He continued the attempt to discover what no longer interested him, because his old ego though it had shrivelled to the extreme of decrepitude still acted mechanically, following the course of preoccupations so utterly abandoned that Swann could not now succeed even in forming an idea of that anguish — so compelling once that he had been unable to foresee his ever being delivered from it, that only the death of her whom he loved (death which, as will be shewn later on in this story, by a cruel example, in no way diminishes the sufferings caused by jealousy) seemed to him capable of making smooth the road, then insurmountably barred to him, of his life

    But to bring to light, some day, those passages in the life of Odette to which he owed his sufferings had not been Swann’s only ambition; he had in reserve that also of wreaking vengeance for his sufferings when, being no longer in love with Odette, he should no longer be afraid of her; and the opportunity of gratifying this second ambition had just occurred, for Swann was in love with another woman, a woman who gave him — grounds for jealousy, no, but who did all the same make him jealous, because he was not capable, now, of altering his way of making love, and it was the way he had used with Odette that must serve him now for another. To make Swann’s jealousy revive it was not essential that this woman should be unfaithful, it sufficed that for any reason she was separated from him, at a party for instance, where she was presumably enjoying herself. That was enough to reawaken in him the old anguish, that lamentable and inconsistent excrescence of his love, which held Swann ever at a distance from what she really was, like a yearning to attain the impossible (what this young woman really felt for him, the hidden longing that absorbed her days, the secret places of her heart), for between Swann and her whom he loved this anguish piled up an unyielding mass of already existing suspicions, having their cause in Odette, or in some other perhaps who had preceded Odette, allowing this now ageing lover to know his mistress of the moment only in the traditional and collective phantasm of the ‘woman who made him jealous,’ in which he had arbitrarily incarnated his new love. Often, however, Swann would charge his jealousy with the offence of making him believe in imaginary infidelities; but then he would remember that he had given Odette the benefit of the same argument and had in that been wrong. And so everything that the young woman whom he loved did in those hours when he was not with her appeared spoiled of its innocence in his eyes. But whereas at that other time he had made a vow that if ever he ceased to love her whom he did not then imagine to be his future wife, he would implacably exhibit to her an indifference that would at length be sincere, so as to avenge his pride that had so long been trampled upon by her — of those reprisals which he might now enforce without risk to himself (for what harm could it do him to be taken at his word and deprived of those intimate moments with Odette that had been so necessary to him once), of those reprisals he took no more thought; with his love had vanished the desire to shew that he was in love no longer. And he who, when he was suffering at the hands of Odette, would have looked forward so keenly to letting her see one day that he had fallen to a rival, now that he was in a position to do so took infinite precautions lest his wife should suspect the existence of this new love

    * * *

    It was not only in those tea-parties, on account of which I had formerly had the sorrow of seeing Gilberte leave me and go home earlier than usual, that I was henceforth to take part, but the engagements that she had with her mother, to go for a walk or to some afternoon party, which by preventing her from coming to the Champs-Elysées had deprived me of her, on those days when I loitered alone upon the lawn or stood before the wooden horses — to these outings M. and Mme. Swann henceforth admitted me, I had a seat in their landau, and indeed it was me that they asked if I would rather go to the theatre, to a dancing lesson at the house of one of Gilberte’s friends, to some social gathering given by friends of her parents (what Odette called ‘a little meeting’) or to visit the tombs at Saint-Denis

    On days when I was going anywhere with the Swanns I would arrive at the house in time for déjeuner, which Mme. Swann called ‘le lunch’; as one was not expected before half-past twelve, while my parents in those days had their meal at a quarter past eleven, it was not until they had risen from the table that I made my way towards that sumptuous quarter, deserted enough at any hour, but more particularly just then, when everyone had gone indoors. Even on winter days of frost, if the weather held, tightening every few minutes the knot of a gorgeous necktie from Charvet’s and looking to see that my varnished boots were not getting dirty, I would roam to and fro among the avenues, waiting until twenty-seven minutes past the hour. I could see from afar in the Swanns’ little garden-plot the sunlight glittering like hoar frost from the bare-boughed trees. It is true that the garden boasted but a pair of them. The unusual hour presented the scene in a new light. Into these pleasures of nature (intensified by the suppression of habit and indeed by my physical hunger) the thrilling prospect of sitting down to luncheon with Mme. Swann was infused; it did not diminish them, but taking command of them trained them to its service; so that if, at this hour when ordinarily I did not perceive them, I seemed now to be discovering the fine weather, the cold, the wintry sunlight, it was all as a sort of preface to the creamed eggs, as a patina, a cool and coloured glaze applied to the decoration of that mystic chapel which was the habitation of Mme. Swann, and in the heart of which there were, by contrast, so much warmth, so many scents and flowers

    At half-past twelve I would finally make up my mind to enter that house which, like an immense Christmas stocking, seemed ready to bestow upon me supernatural delights. (The French name ‘Noël’ was, by the way, unknown to Mme. Swann and Gilberte, who had substituted for it the English ‘Christmas,’ and would speak of nothing but ‘Christmas pudding,’ what people had given them as ‘Christmas presents’ and of going away — the thought of which maddened me with grief —‘for Christmas.’ At home even, I should have thought it degrading to use the word ‘Noël,’ and always said ‘Christmas,’ which my father considered extremely silly.)

    I encountered no one at first but a footman who after leading me through several large drawing-rooms shewed me into one that was quite small, empty, its windows beginning to dream already in the blue light of afternoon; I was left alone there in the company of orchids, roses and violets, which, like people who are kept waiting in a room beside you but do not know you, preserved a silence which their individuality as living things made all the more impressive, and received coldly the warmth of a glowing fire of coals, preciously displayed behind a screen of crystal, in a basin of white marble over which it spilled, now and again, its perilous rubies

    I had sat down, but I rose hurriedly on hearing the door opened; it was only another footman, and then a third, and the minute result chat their vainly alarming entrances and exits achieved was to put a little more coal on the fire or water in the vases. They departed, I found myself alone, once that door was shut which Mme. Swann was surely soon going to open. Of a truth, I should have been less ill at ease in a magician’s cave than in this little waiting-room where the fire appeared to me to be performing alchemical transmutations as in Klingsor’s laboratory. Footsteps sounded afresh, I did not rise, it was sure to be just another footman; it was M. Swann. “What! All by yourself? What is one to do; that poor wife of mine has never been able to remember what time means! Ten minutes to one. She gets later every day. And you’ll see, she will come sailing in without the least hurry, and imagine she’s in heaps of time.” And as he was still subject to neuritis, and as he was becoming a trifle ridiculous, the fact of possessing so unpunctual a wife, who came in so late from the Bois, forgot everything at her dressmaker’s and was never in time for luncheon made Swann anxious for his digestion but flattered his self-esteem

    He shewed me his latest acquisitions and explained their interest to me, but my emotion, added to the unfamiliarity of being still without food at this hour, sweeping through my mind left it void, so that while able to speak I was incapable of hearing. Anyhow, so far as the works of art in Swann’s possession were concerned, it was enough for me that they were contained in his house, formed a part there of the delicious hour that preceded luncheon. The Gioconda herself might have appeared there without giving me any more pleasure than one of Mme. Swann’s indoor gowns, or her scent bottles

    I continued to wait, alone or with Swann, and often with Gilberte, come in to keep us company. The arrival of Mme. Swann, prepared for me by all those majestic apparitions, must (so it seemed to me) be something truly immense. I strained my ears to catch the slightest sound. But one never finds quite as high as one has been expecting a cathedral, a wave in a storm, a dancer’s leap in the air; after those liveried footmen, suggesting the chorus whose processional entry upon the stage leads up to and at the same time diminishes the final appearance of the queen, Mme. Swann, creeping furtively in, with a little otter-skin coat, her veil lowered to cover a nose pink-tipped by the cold, did not fulfil the promises lavished, while I had been waiting, upon my imagination

   But if she had stayed at home all morning, when she arrived in the drawing-room she would be clad in a wrapper of crêpe-de-Chine, brightly coloured, which seemed to me more exquisite than any of her dresses

    Sometimes the Swanns decided to remain in the house all afternoon, and then, as we had had luncheon so late, very soon I must watch setting, beyond the garden-wall, the sun of that day which had seemed to me bound to be different from other days; then in vain might the servants bring in lamps of every size and shape, burning each upon the consecrated altar of a console, a card-table, a corner-cupboard, a bracket, as though for the celebration of some strange and secret rite; nothing extraordinary transpired in the conversation, and I went home disappointed, as one often is in one’s childhood after the midnight mass

    But my disappointment was scarcely more than mental. I was radiant with happiness in this house where Gilberte, when she was still not with us, was about to appear and would bestow on me in a moment, and for hours to come, her speech, her smiling and attentive gaze, just as I had caught it, that first time, at Combray. At the most I was a trifle jealous when I saw her so often disappear into vast rooms above, reached by a private staircase. Obliged myself to remain in the drawing-room, like a man in love with an actress who is confined to his stall ‘in front’ and wonders anxiously what is going on behind the scenes, in the green-room, I put to Swann, with regard to this other part of the house questions artfully veiled, but in a tone from which I could not quite succeed in banishing the note of uneasiness. He explained to me that the place to which Gilberte had gone was the linen-room, offered himself to shew it to me, and promised me that whenever Gilberte Had occasion to go there again he would insist upon her taking me with her. By these last words and the relief which they brought me Swann at once annihilated for me one of those terrifying interior perspectives at the end of which a woman with whom we are in love appears so remote. At that moment I felt for him an affection which I believed to be deeper than my affection for Gilberte. For he, being the master over his daughter, was giving her to me, whereas she, she withheld herself now and then, I had not the same direct control over her as I had indirectly through Swann. Besides, it was she whom I loved and could not, therefore look upon without that disturbance, without that desire for something more which destroys in us, in the presence of one whom we love, the sensation of loving

    As a rule, however, we did not stay indoors, we went out. Sometimes, before going to dress, Mme. Swann would sit down at the piano. Her lovely hands, escaping from the pink, or white, or, often, vividly coloured sleeves of her crêpe-de-Chine wrapper, drooped over the keys with that same melancholy which was in her eyes but was not in her heart. It was on one of those days that she happened to play me the part of Vinteuil’s sonata that contained the little phrase of which Swann had been so fond. But often one listens and hears nothing, if it is a piece of music at all complicated to which one is listening for the first time. And yet when, later on, this sonata had been played over to me two or three times I found that I knew it quite well. And so it is not wrong to speak of hearing a thing for the first time. If one had indeed, as one supposes, received no impression from the first hearing, the second, the third would be equally ‘first hearings’ and there would be no reason why one should understand it any better after the tenth. Probably what is wanting, the first time, is not comprehension but memory. For our memory, compared to the complexity of the impressions which it has to face while we are listening, is infinitesimal, as brief as the memory of a man who in his sleep thinks of a thousand things and at once forgets them, or as that of a man in his second childhood who cannot recall, a minute afterwards, what one has just been saying to him. Of these multiple impressions our memory is not capable of furnishing us with an immediate picture. But that picture gradually takes shape, and, with regard to works which we have heard more than once, we are like the schoolboy who has read several times over before going to sleep a lesson which he supposed himself not to know, and finds that he can repeat it by heart next morning. It was only that I had not, until then, heard a note of the sonata, whereas Swann and his wife could make out a distinct phrase that was as far beyond the range of my perception as a name which one endeavours to recall and in place of which one discovers only a void, a void from which, an hour later, when one is not thinking about them, will spring of their own accord, in one continuous flight, the syllables that one has solicited in vain. And not only does one not seize at once and retain an impression of works that are really great, but even in the content of any such work (as befell me in the case of Vinteuil’s sonata) it is the least valuable parts that one at first perceives. Thus it was that I was mistaken not only in thinking that this work held nothing further in store for me (so that for a long time I made no effort to hear it again) from the moment in which Mme. Swann had played over to me its most famous passage; I was in this respect as stupid as people are who expect to feel no astonishment when they stand in Venice before the front of Saint Mark’s, because photography has already acquainted them with the outline of its domes. Far more than that, even when I had heard the sonata played from beginning to end, it remained almost wholly invisible to me, like a monument of which its distance or a haze in the atmosphere allows us to catch but a faint and fragmentary glimpse. Hence the depression inseparable from one’s knowledge of such works, as of everything that acquires reality in time. When the least obvious beauties of Vinteuil’s sonata were revealed to me, already, borne by the force of habit beyond the reach of my sensibility, those that I had from the first distinguished and preferred in it were beginning to escape, to avoid me. Since I was able only in successive moments to enjoy all the pleasures that this sonata gave me, I never possessed it in its entirety: it was like life itself. But, less disappointing than life is, great works of art do not begin by giving us all their best. In Vinteuil’s sonata the beauties that one discovers at once are those also of which one most soon grows tired, and for the same reason, no doubt, namely that they are less different from what one already knows. But when those first apparitions have withdrawn, there is left for our enjoyment some passage which its composition, too new and strange to offer anything but confusion to our mind, had made indistinguishable and so preserved intact; and this, which we have been meeting every day and have not guessed it, which has thus been held in reserve for us, which by the sheer force of its beauty has become invisible and has remained unknown, this comes to us last of all. But this also must be the last that we shall relinquish. And we shall love it longer than the rest because we have taken longer to get to love it. The time, moreover, that a person requires — as I required in the matter of this sonata — to penetrate a work of any depth is merely an epitome, a symbol, one might say, of the years, the centuries even that must elapse before the public can begin to cherish a masterpiece that is really new. So that the man of genius, to shelter himself from the ignorant contempt of the world, may say to himself that, since one’s contemporaries are incapable of the necessary detachment, works written for posterity should be read by posterity alone, like certain pictures which one cannot appreciate when one stands too close to them. But, as it happens, any such cowardly precaution to avoid false judgments is doomed to failure; they are inevitable. The reason for which a work of genius is not easily admired from the first is that the man who has created it is extraordinary, that few other men resemble him. It was Beethoven’s Quartets themselves (the Twelfth, Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth) that devoted half a century to forming, fashioning and enlarging a public for Beethoven’s Quartets, marking in this way, like every great work of art, an advance if not in artistic merit at least in intellectual society, largely composed to-day of what was not to be found when the work first appeared, that is to say of persons capable of enjoying it. What artists call posterity is the posterity of the work of art. It is essential that the work (leaving out of account, for brevity’s sake, the contingency that several men of genius may at the same time be working along parallel lines to create a more instructed public in the future, a public from which other men of genius shall reap the benefit) shall create its own posterity. For if the work were held in reserve, were revealed only to posterity, that audience, for that particular work, would be not posterity but a group of contemporaries who were merely living half-a-century later in time. And so it is essential that the artist (and this is what Vinteuil had done), if he wishes his work to be free to follow its own course, shall launch it, wherever he may find sufficient depth, confidently outward bound towards the future. And yet this interval of time, the true perspective in which to behold a work of art, if leaving it out of account is the mistake made by bad judges, taking it into account is at times a dangerous precaution of the good. No doubt one can easily imagine, by an illusion similar to that which makes everything on the horizon appear equidistant, that all the revolutions which have hitherto occurred in painting or in music did at least shew respect for certain rules, whereas that which immediately confronts us, be it impressionism, a striving after discord, an exclusive use of the Chinese scale, cubism, futurism or what you will, differs outrageously from all that have occurred before. Simply because those that have occurred before we are apt to regard as a whole, forgetting that a long process of assimilation has melted them into a continuous substance, varied of course but, taking it as a whole, homogeneous, in which Hugo blends with Molière. Let us try to imagine the shocking incoherence that we should find, if we did not take into account the future, and the changes that it must bring about, in a horoscope of our own riper years, drawn and presented to us in our youth. Only horoscopes are not always accurate, and the necessity, when judging a work of art, of including the temporal factor in the sum total of its beauty introduces, to our way of thinking, something as hazardous, and consequently as barren of interest, as every prophecy the non-fulfilment of which will not at all imply any inadequacy on the prophet’s part, for the power to summon possibilities into existence or to exclude them from it is not necessarily within the competence of genius; one may have had genius and yet not have believed in the future of railways or of flight, or, although a brilliant psychologist, in the infidelity of a mistress or of a friend whose treachery persons far less gifted would have foreseen

    If I did not understand the sonata, it enchanted me to hear Mme. Swann play. Her touch appeared to me (like her wrappers, like the scent of her staircase, her cloaks, her chrysanthemums) to form part of an individual and mysterious whole, in a world infinitely superior to that in which the mind is capable of analysing talent. “Attractive, isn’t it, that Vinteuil sonata?” Swann asked me. “The moment when night is darkening among the trees, when the arpeggios of the violin call down a cooling dew upon the earth. You must admit that it is rather charming; it shews all the static side of moonlight, which is the essential part. It is not surprising that a course of radiant heat such as my wife is taking, should act on the muscles, since moonlight can prevent the leaves from stirring. That is what he expresses so well in that little phrase, the Bois de Boulogne plunged in a cataleptic trance. By the sea it is even more striking, because you have there the faint response of the waves, which, of course, you can hear quite distinctly, since nothing else dares to move. In Paris it is the other way; at the most, you may notice unfamiliar lights among the old buildings, the sky brightened as though by a colourless and harmless conflagration, that sort of vast variety show of which you get a hint here and there. But in Vinteuil’s little phrase, and in the whole sonata for that matter, it is not like that; the scene is laid in the Bois; in the gruppetto you can distinctly hear a voice saying: ‘I can almost see to read the paper!’” These words from Swann might have falsified, later on, my impression of the sonata, music being too little exclusive to inhibit absolutely what other people suggest that we should find in it. But I understood from other words which he let fall that this nocturnal foliage was simply that beneath whose shade in many a restaurant on the outskirts of Paris he had listened on many an evening to the little phrase. In place of the profound significance that he had so often sought in it, what it recalled now to Swann were the leafy boughs, arranged, wreathed, painted round about it (which it gave him the desire to see again because it seemed to him to be their inner, their hidden self, as it were their soul); was the whole of one spring season which he had not been able to enjoy before, not having had — feverish and moody as he then was — enough strength of body and mind for its enjoyment, which, as one puts by for an invalid the dainties that he has not been able to eat, it had kept in store for him. The charm that he had been made to feel by certain evenings in the Bois, a charm of which Vinteuil’s sonata served to remind him, he could not have recaptured by questioning Odette, although she, as well as the little phrase, had been his companion there. But Odette had been merely his companion, by his side, not (as the phrase had been) within him, and so had seen nothing — nor would she, had she been a thousand times as comprehending, have seen anything of that vision which for no one among us (or at least I was long under the impression that this rule admitted no exception) can be made externally visible. “It is rather charming, don’t you think,” Swann continued, “that sound can give a reflection, like water, or glass. It is curious, too, that Vinteuil’s phrase now shews me only the things to which I paid no attention then. Of my troubles, my loves of those days it recalls nothing, it has altered all my values.” “Charles, I don’t think that’s very polite to me, what you’re saying.” “Not polite? Really, you women are superb! I was simply trying to explain to this young man that what the music shews — to me, at least — is not for a moment ‘Free-will’ or ‘In Tune with the Infinite,’ but shall we say old Verdurin in his frock coat in the palm-house at the Jardin d’Acclimatation. Hundreds of times, without my leaving this room, the little phrase has carried me off to dine with it at Armenonville. Gad, it is less boring, anyhow, than having to go there with Mme. de Cambremer.” Mme. Swann laughed. “That is a lady who is supposed to have been violently in love with Charles,” she explained, in the same tone in which, shortly before, when we were speaking of Vermeer of Delft, of whose existence I had been surprised to find her conscious, she had answered me with: “I ought to explain that M. Swann was very much taken up with that painter at the time he was courting me. Isn’t that so, Charles dear?” “You’re not to start saying things about Mme. de Cambremer!” Swann checked her, secretly flattered. “But I’m only repeating what I’ve been told. Besides, it seems that she’s an extremely clever woman; I don’t know her myself. I believe she’s very pushing, which surprises me rather in a clever woman. But everyone says that she was quite mad about you; there’s no harm in repeating that.” Swann remained silent as a deaf-mute which was in a way a confirmation of what she had said, and a proof of his own fatuity. “Since what I’m playing reminds you of the Jardin d’Acclimatation,” his wife went on, with a playful semblance of being offended, “we might take him there some day in the carriage, if it would amuse him. It’s lovely there just now, and you can recapture your fond impressions! Which reminds me, talking of the Jardin d’Acclimatation, do you know, this young man thought that we were devotedly attached to a person whom I cut, as a matter of fact, whenever I possibly can, Mme. Blatin! I think it is rather crushing for us, that she should be taken for a friend of ours. Just fancy, dear Dr. Cottard, who never says a harsh word about anyone, declares that she’s positively contagious.” “A frightful woman! The one thing to be said for her is that she is exactly like Savonarola. She is the very image of that portrait of Savonarola, by Fra Bartolomeo.” This mania which Swann had for finding likenesses to people in pictures was defensible, for even what we call individual expression is — as we so painfully discover when we are in love and would fain believe in the unique reality of the beloved — something diffused and general, which can be found existing at different periods. But if one had listened to Swann, the processions of the Kings of the East, already so anachronistic when Benozzo Gozzoli introduced in their midst various Medici, would have been even more so, since they would have included the portraits of a whole crowd of men, contemporaries not of Gozzoli but of Swann, subsequent, that is to say not only by fifteen centuries to the Nativity but by four more to the painter himself. There was not missing from those trains, according to Swann, a single living Parisian of any note, any more than there was from that act in one of Sardou’s plays, in which, out of friendship for the author and for the leading lady, and also because it was the fashion, all the best known men in Paris, famous doctors, politicians, barristers, amused themselves, each on a different evening, by ‘walking on.’ “But what has she got to do with the Jardin d’Acclimatation?” “Everything!” “What? You don’t suggest that she’s got a sky-blue behind, like the monkeys?” “Charles, you really are too dreadful! I was thinking of what the Cingalese said to her. Do tell him, Charles; it really is a gem.” “Oh, it’s too silly. You know, Mme. Blatin loves asking people questions, in a tone which she thinks friendly, but which is really overpowering.” “What our good friends on the Thames call ‘patronising,’” interrupted Odette. “Exactly. Well, she went the other day to the Jardin d’Acclimatation, where they have some blackamoors — Cingalese, I think I heard my wife say; she is much ‘better up’ in ethnology than I am.” “Now, Charles, you’re not to make fun of poor me.”

    “I’ve no intention of making fun, I assure you. Well, to continue, she went up to one of these black fellows with ‘Good morning, nigga!’ . . . ” “Oh, it’s too absurd!” “Anyhow, this classification seems to have displeased the black. ‘Me nigga,’ he shouted (quite furious, don’t you know), to Mme. Blatin, ‘me nigga; you, old cow!’” “I do think that’s so delightful! I adore that story. Do say it’s a good one. Can’t you see old Blatin standing there, and hearing him: ‘Me nigga; you, old cow’?” I expressed an intense desire to go there and see these Cingalese, one of whom had called Mme. Blatin an old cow. They did not interest me in the least. But I reflected that in going to the Jardin d’Acclimatation, and again on our way home, we should pass along that Allée des Acacias in which I had loved so, once, to gaze on Mme. Swann, and that perhaps Coquelin’s mulatto friend, to whom I had never managed to exhibit myself in the act of saluting her, would see me there, seated at her side, as the victoria swept by

    During those minutes in which Gilberte, having gone to ‘get ready,’ was not in the room with us, M. and Mme. Swann would take delight in revealing to me all the rare virtues of their child. And everything that I myself observed seemed to prove the truth of what they said. I remarked that, as her mother had told me, she had not only for her friends but for the servants, for the poor, the most delicate attentions carefully thought out, a desire to give pleasure, a fear of causing annoyance, translated into all sorts of trifling actions which must often have meant great inconvenience to her. She had done some ‘work’ for our stall-keeper in the Champs-Elysées, and went out in the snow to give it to her with her own hands, so as not to lose a day. “You have no idea how kind-hearted she is, she won’t let it be seen,” her father assured me. Young as she was, she appeared far more sensible already than her parents. When Swann boasted of his wife’s grand friends Gilberte would turn away, and remain silent, but without any air of reproaching him, for it seemed inconceivable to her that her father could be subjected to the slightest criticism. One day, when I had spoken to her of Mlle. Vinteuil, she said to me:

    “I shall never know her, for a very good reason, and that is that she was not nice to her father, by what one hears, she gave him a lot of trouble. You can’t understand that any more than I, can you; I’m sure you could no more live without your papa than I could, which is quite natural after all. How can one ever forget a person one has loved all one’s life?”

    And once when she was making herself particularly endearing to Swann, as I mentioned this to her when he was out of the room:

    “Yes, poor Papa, it is the anniversary of his father’s death, just now. You can understand what he must be feeling; you do understand, don’t you; you and I feel the same about things like that. So I just try to be a little less naughty than usual.” “But he doesn’t ever think you naughty. He thinks you’re quite perfect.” “Poor Papa, that’s because he’s far too good himself.”

    But her parents were not content with singing the praises of Gilberte — that same Gilberte, who, even, before I had set eyes on her, used to appear to me standing before a church, in a landscape of the He de France, and later, awakening in me not dreams now but memories, was embowered always in a hedge of pink hawthorn, in the little lane that I took when I was going the Méséglise way. Once when I had asked Mme. Swann (and had made an effort to assume the indifferent tone of a friend of the family, curious to know the preferences of a child), which among all her playmates Gilberte liked the best, Mme. Swann replied: “But you ought to know a great deal better than I do. You are in her confidence, her great favourite, her ‘chum,’ as the English say.”

    It appears that in a coincidence as perfect as this was, when reality is folded over to cover the ideal of which we have so long been dreaming, it completely hides that ideal, absorbing it in itself, as when two geometrical figures that are congruent are made to coincide, so that there is but one, whereas we would rather, so as to give its full significance to our enjoyment, preserve for all those separate points of our desire, at the very moment in which we succeed in touching them, and so as to be quite certain that they are indeed themselves, the distinction of being intangible. And our thought cannot even reconstruct the old state so as to confront the new with it, for it has no longer a clear field: the acquaintance that we have made, the memory of those first, unhoped-for moments, the talk to which we have listened are there now to block the passage of our consciousness, and as they control the outlets of our memory far more than those of our imagination, they react more forcibly upon our past, which we are no longer able to visualise without taking them into account, than upon the form, still unshaped, of our future. I had been able to believe, year after year, that the right to visit Mme. Swann was a vague and fantastic privilege to which I should never attain; after I had spent a quarter of an hour in her drawing-room, it was the period in which I did not yet know her that was become fantastic and vague like a possibility which the realisation of an alternative possibility has made impossible. How was I ever to dream again of her dining-room as of an inconceivable place, when I could not make the least movement in my mind without crossing the path of that inextinguishable ray cast backwards to infinity, even ino my own most distant past, by the lobster à l’Américaine which I had just been eating? And Swann must have observed in his own case a similar phenomenon; for this house in which he entertained me might be regarded as the place into which had flowed, to coincide and be lost in one another, not only the ideal dwelling that my imagination had constructed, but another still, that which his jealous love, as inventive as any fantasy of mine, had so often depicted to him, that dwelling common to Odette and himself which had appeared so inaccessible once, on evenings when Odette had taken him home with Forcheville to drink orangeade with her; and what had flowed in to be absorbed, for him, in the walls and furniture of the dining-room in which we now sat down to luncheon was that unhoped-for paradise in which, in the old days, he could not without a pang imagine that he would one day be saying to their butler those very words, “Is Madame ready yet?” which I now heard him utter with a touch of impatience mingled with self-satisfaction. No more than, probably, Swann himself could I succeed in knowing my own happiness, and when Gilberte once broke out: “Who would ever have said that the little girl you watched playing prisoners’ base, without daring to speak to her, would one day be your greatest friend, and you would go to her house whenever you liked?” she spoke of a change the occurrence of which I could verify only by observing it from without, finding no trace of it within myself, for it was composed of two separate states on both of which I could not, without their ceasing to be distinct from one another, succeed in keeping my thoughts fixed at one and the same time

    And yet this house, because it had been so passionately desired by Swann, must have kept for him some of its attraction, if I was to judge by myself for whom it had not lost all its mystery. That singular charm in which I had for so long supposed the life of the Swanns to be bathed I had not completely exorcised from their house on making my own way into it; I had made it, that charm, recoil, overpowered as it must be by the sight of the stranger, the pariah that I had been, to whom now Mme. Swann pushed forward graciously for him to sit in it an armchair exquisite, hostile, scandalised; but all round me that charm, in my memory, I can still distinguish. Is it because, on those days on which M. and Mme. Swann invited me to luncheon, to go out afterwards with them and Gilberte, I imprinted with my gaze — while I sat waiting for them there alone — on the carpet, the sofas, the tables, the screens, the pictures, the idea engraved upon my mind that Mme. Swann, or her husband, or Gilberte was about to enter the room? Is it because those objects have dwelt ever since in my memory side by side with the Swanns, and have gradually acquired something of their personal character? Is it because, knowing that the Swanns passed their existence among all those things, I made of all of them as it were emblems of the private lives, of those habits of the Swanns from which I had too long been excluded for them not to continue to appear strange to me, even when I was allowed the privilege of sharing in them? However it may be, always when I think of that drawing-room which Swann (not that the criticism implied on his part any intention to find fault with his wife’s taste) found so incongruous — because, while it was still planned and carried out in the style, half conservatory, half studio, which had been that of the rooms in which he had first known Odette, she had, none the less, begun to replace in its medley a quantity of the Chinese ornaments, which she now felt to be rather gimcrack, a trifle dowdy, by a swarm of little chairs and stools and things upholstered in old Louis XIV silks; not to mention the works of art brought by Swann himself from his house on the Quai d’Orléans — it has kept in my memory, on the contrary, that composite, heterogeneous room, a cohesion, a unity, an individual charm never possessed even by the most complete, the least spoiled of such collections that the past has bequeathed to us, or the most modern, alive and stamped with the imprint of a living personality; for we alone can, by our belief that they have an existence of their own, give to certain of the things that we see a soul which they afterwards keep, which they develop in our minds. All the ideas that I had formed of the hours, different from those that exist for other men, passed by the Swanns in that house which was to their life what the body is to the soul, and must give expression to its singularity, all those ideas were rearranged, amalgamated — equally disturbing and indefinite throughout — in the arrangement of the furniture, the thickness of the carpets, the position of the windows, the ministrations of the servants. When, after luncheon, we went in the sunshine to drink our coffee in the great bay window of the drawing-room, while Mme. Swann was asking me how many lumps of sugar I took, it was not only the silk-covered stool which she pushed towards me that emitted, with the agonising charm that I had long ago felt — first among the pink hawthorn and then beside the clump of laurels — in the name of Gilberte, the hostility that her parents had shewn to me, which this little piece of furniture seemed to have so well understood, to have so completely shared that I felt myself unworthy, and found myself almost reluctant to set my feet on its defenceless cushion; a personality, a soul was latent there which linked it secretly to the light of two o’clock in the afternoon, so different from any other light, in the gulf in which there played about our feet its sparkling tide of gold out of which the bluish crags of sofas and vaporous carpet beaches emerged like enchanted islands; and there was nothing, even to the painting by Rubens hung above the chimney-piece, that was not endowed with the same quality and almost the same intensity of charm as the laced boots of M. Swann, and that hooded cape, the like of which I had so dearly longed to wear, whereas now Odette would beg her husband to go and put on another, so as to appear more smart, whenever I did them the honour of driving out with them. She too went away to change her dress — not heeding my protestations that no ‘outdoor’ clothes could be nearly so becoming as the marvellous garment of crêpe-de-Chine or silk, old rose, cherry-coloured, Tiepolo pink, white, mauve, green, red or yellow, plain or patterned, in which Mme. Swann had sat down to luncheon and which she was now going to take off. When I assured her that she ought to go out in that costume, she laughed, either in scorn of my ignorance or from delight in my compliment. She apologised for having so many wrappers, explaining that they were the only kind of dress in which she felt comfortable, and left us, to go and array herself in one of those regal toilets which imposed their majesty on all beholders, and yet among which I was sometimes summoned to decide which of them I preferred that she should put on

    In the Jardin d’Acclimatation, how proud I was when we had left the carriage to be walking by the side of Mme. Swann! While she strolled carelessly on, letting her cloak stream on the air behind her, I kept eyeing her with an admiring gaze to which she coquettishly responded in a lingering smile. And now, were we to meet one or other of Gilberte’s friends, boy or girl, who saluted us from afar, I would in my turn be looked upon by them as one of those happy creatures whose lot I had envied, one of those friends of Gilberte who knew her family and had a share in that other part of her life, the part which was not spent in the Champs-Elysées

    Often upon the paths of the Bois or the Jardin we passed, we were greeted by some great lady who was Swann’s friend, whom he perchance did not see, so that his wife must rally him with a “Charles! Don’t you see Mme. de Montmorency?” And Swann, with that amicable smile, bred of a long and intimate friendship, bared his head, but with a slow sweeping gesture, with a grace peculiarly his own. Sometimes the lady would stop, glad of an opportunity to shew Mme. Swann a courtesy which would involve no tiresome consequences, by which they all knew that she would never seek to profit, so thoroughly had Swann trained her in reserve. She had none the less acquired all the manners of polite society, and however smart, however stately the lady might be, Mme. Swann was invariably a match for her; halting for a moment before the friend whom her husband had recognised and was addressing, she would introduce us, Gilberte and myself, with so much ease of manner, would remain so free, so tranquil in her exercise of courtesy, that it would have been hard to say, looking at them both, which of the two was the aristocrat. The day on which we went to inspect the Cingalese, on our way home we saw coming in our direction, and followed by two others who seemed to be acting as her escort, an elderly but still attractive woman cloaked in a dark mantle and capped with a little bonnet tied beneath her chin with a pair of ribbons. “Ah! Here is someone who will interest you!” said Swann. The old lady, who had come within a few yards of us, now smiled at us with a caressing sweetness. Swann doffed his hat. Mme. Swann swept to the ground in a curtsey and made as if to kiss the hand of the lady, who, standing there like a Winterhalter portrait, drew her up again and kissed her cheek. “There, there; will you put your hat on, you!” she scolded Swann in a thick and almost growling voice, speaking like an old and familiar friend. “I am going to present you to Her Imperial Highness,” Mme. Swann whispered. Swann drew me aside for a moment while his wife talked of the weather and of the animals recently added to the Jardin d’Acclimatation, with the Princess. “That is the Princesse Mathilde,” he told me; “you know who’ I mean, the friend of Flaubert, Sainte-Beuve, Dumas. Just fancy, she’s the niece of Napoleon I. She had offers of marriage from Napoleon III and the Emperor of Russia. Isn’t that interesting? Talk to her a little. But I hope she won’t keep us standing here for an hour! . . . I met Taine the other day,” he went on, addressing the Princess, “and he told me that your Highness was vexed with him.” “He’s behaved like a perfect peeg!” she said gruffly, pronouncing the word cochon as though she referred to Joan of Arc’s contemporary, Bishop Cauchon. “After his article on the Emperor I left my card on him with p. p. c. on it.” I felt the surprise that one feels on opening the Correspondence of that Duchesse d’Orléans who was by birth a Princess Palatine. And indeed Princesse Mathilde, animated by sentiments so entirely French, expressed them with a straightforward bluntness that recalled the Germany of an older generation, and was inherited, doubtless, from her Wuerttemberg mother. This somewhat rude and almost masculine frankness she softened, as soon as she began to smile, with an Italian languor. And the whole person was clothed in a dress so typically ‘Second Empire’ that — for all that the Princess wore it simply and solely, no doubt, from attachment to the fashions that she had loved when she was young — she seemed to have deliberately planned to avoid the slightest discrepancy in historic colour, and to be satisfying the expectations of those who looked to her to evoke the memory of another age. I whispered to Swann to ask her whether she had known Musset. “Very slightly, sir,” was the answer, given in a tone which seemed to feign annoyance at the question, and of course it was by way of a joke that she called Swann ‘Sir,’ since they were intimate friends. “I had him to dine once. I had invited him for seven o’clock. At half-past seven, as he had not appeared, we sat down to dinner. He arrived at eight, bowed to me, took his seat, never opened his lips, went off after dinner without letting me hear the sound of his voice. Of course, he was dead drunk. That hardly encouraged me to make another attempt.” We were standing a little way off, Swann and I. “I hope this little audience is not going to last much longer,” he muttered, “the soles of my feet are hurting. I cannot think why my wife keeps on making conversation. When we get home it will be she that complains of being tired, and she knows I simply cannot go on standing like this.” For Mme. Swann, who had had the news from Mme. Bontemps, was in the course of telling the Princess that the Government, having at last begun to realise the depth of its depravity, had decided to send her an invitation to be present on the platform in a few days’ time, when the Tsar Nicholas was to visit the Invalides. But the Princess who, in spite of appearances, in spite of the character of her circle, which consisted mainly of artists and literary people, had remained at heart and shewed herself, whenever she had to take action, the niece of Napoleon, replied: “Yes, Madame, I received it this morning, and I sent it back to the Minister, who must have had it by now. I told him that I had no need of an invitation to go to the Invalides. If the Government desires my presence there, it will not be on the platform, it will be in our vault, where the Emperor’s tomb is. I have no need of a card to admit me there. I have my keys. I go in and out when I choose. The Government has only to let me know whether it wishes me to be present or not. But if I do go to the Invalides, it will be down below there or nowhere at all.” At that moment we were saluted, Mme. Swann and I, by a young man who greeted her without stopping, and whom I was not aware that she knew; it was Bloch. I inquired about him, and was told that he had been introduced to her by Mme. Bontemps, and that he was employed in the Minister’s secretariat, which was news to me. Anyhow, she could not have seen him often — or perhaps she had not cared to utter the name, hardly ‘smart’ enough for her liking, of Bloch, for she told me that he was called M. Moreul. I assured her that she was mistaken, that his name was Bloch. The Princess gathered up the train that flowed out behind her, while Mme. Swann gazed at it with admiring eyes. “It is only a fur that the Emperor of Russia sent me,” she explained, “and as I have just been to see him I put it on, so as to shew him that I’d managed to have it made up as a mantle.” “I hear that Prince Louis has joined the Russian Army; the Princess will be very sad at losing him,” went on Mme. Swann, not noticing her husband’s signals of distress. “That was a fine thing to do. As I said to him, ‘Just because there’s been a soldier, before, in the family, that’s no reason!’” replied the Princess, alluding with this abrupt simplicity to Napoleon the Great. But Swann could hold out no longer. “Ma’am, it is I that am going to play the Prince, and ask your permission to retire; but, you see, my wife has not been so well, and I do not like her to stand still for any time.” Mme. Swann curtseyed again, and the Princess conferred upon us all a celestial smile, which she seemed to have summoned out of the past, from among the graces of her girlhood, from the evenings at Compiègne, a smile which glided, sweet and unbroken, over her hitherto so sullen face; then she went on her way, followed by the two ladies in waiting, who had confined themselves, in the manner of interpreters, of children’s or invalids’ nurses, to punctuating our conversation with insignificant sentences and superfluous explanations. “You should go and write your name in her book, one day this week,” Mme. Swann counselled me. “One doesn’t leave cards upon these ‘Royalties,’ as the English call them, but she will invite you to her house if you put your name down.”

    Sometimes in those last days of winter we would go, before proceeding on our expedition, into one of the small picture-shows that were being given at that time, where Swann, as a collector of mark, was greeted with special deference by the dealers in whose galleries they were held. And in that still wintry weather the old longing to set out for the South of France and Venice would be reawakened in me by those rooms in which a springtime, already well advanced, and a blazing sun cast violet shadows upon the roseate Alpilles and gave the intense transparency of emeralds to the Grand Canal. If the weather were inclement, we would go to a concert or a theatre, and afterwards to one of the fashionable tearooms. There, whenever Mme. Swann had anything to say to me which she did not wish the people at the next table, or even the waiters who brought our tea, to understand, she would say it in English, as though that had been a secret language known to our two selves alone. As it happened everyone in the place knew English — I only had not yet learned the language, and was obliged to say so to Mme. Swann in order that she might cease to make, on the people who were drinking tea or were serving us with it, remarks which I guessed to be uncomplimentary without either my understanding or the person referred to losing a single word

    Once, in the matter of an afternoon at the theatre, Gilberte gave me a great surprise. It was precisely the day of which she had spoken to me some time back, on which fell the anniversary of her grandfather’s death. We were to go, she and I, with her governess, to hear selections from an opera, and Gilberte had dressed with a view to attending this performance, and wore the air of indifference with which she was in the habit of treating whatever we might be going to do, with the comment that it might be anything in the world, no matter what, provided that it amused me and had her parents’ approval. Before luncheon, her mother drew us aside to tell us that her father was vexed at the thought of our going to a theatre on that day. This seemed to me only natural. Gilberte remained impassive, but grew pale with an anger which she was unable to conceal; still she uttered not a word. When M. Swann joined us his wife took him to the other end of the room and said something in his ear. He called Gilberte, and they went together into the next room. We could hear their raised voices. And yet I could not bring myself to believe that Gilberte, so submissive, so loving, so thoughtful, would resist her father’s appeal, on such a day and for so trifling a matter. At length Swann reappeared with her, saying: “You heard what I said. Now you may do as you like.”

    Gilberte’s features remained compressed in a frown throughout luncheon, after which we retired to her room. Then suddenly, without hesitating and as though she had never at any point hesitated over her course of action: “Two o’clock!” she exclaimed. “You know the concert begins at half past.” And she told her governess to make haste

    “But,” I reminded her, “won’t your father be cross with you?”

    “Not the least little bit!”

    “Surely, he was afraid it would look odd, because of the anniversary.”

    “What difference can it make to me what people think? I think it’s perfectly absurd to worry about other people in matters of sentiment. We feel things for ourselves, not for the public. Mademoiselle has very few pleasures; she’s been looking forward to going to this concert. I am not going to deprive her of it just to satisfy public opinion.”

    “But, Gilberte,” I protested, taking her by the arm, “it is not to satisfy public opinion, it is to please your father.”

    “You are not going to pass remarks upon my conduct, I hope,” she said sharply, plucking her arm away

    * * *

    A favour still more precious than their taking me with them to the Jardin d’Acclimatation, the Swanns did not exclude me even from their friendship with Bergotte, which had been at the root of the attraction that I had found in them when, before I had even seen Gilberte, I reflected that her intimacy with that godlike elder would have made her, for me, the most passionately enthralling of friends, had not the disdain that I was bound to inspire in her forbidden me to hope that she would ever take me, in his company, to visit the towns that he loved. And lo, one day, came an invitation from Mme. Swann to a big luncheon-party. I did not know who else were to be the guests. On my arrival I was disconcerted, as I crossed the hall, by an alarming incident. Mme. Swann seldom missed an opportunity of adopting any of those customs which pass as fashionable for a season, and then, failing to find support, are speedily abandoned (as, for instance, many years before, she had had her ‘private hansom,’ or now had, printed in English upon a card inviting you to luncheon, the words, ‘To meet,’ followed by the name of some more or less important personage). Often enough these usages implied nothing mysterious and required no initiation. Take, for instance, a minute innovation of those days, imported from England; Odette had made her husband have some visiting cards printed on which the name Charles Swann was preceded by ‘Mr.’. After the first visit that I paid her, Mme. Swann had left at my door one of these ‘pasteboards,’ as she called them. No one had ever left a card on me before; I felt at once so much pride, emotion, gratitude that, scraping together all the money I possessed, I ordered a superb basket of camellias and had it sent to Mme. Swann. I implored my father to go and leave a card on her, but first, quickly, to have some printed on which his name should bear the prefix ‘Mr.’. He vouchsafed neither of my prayers; I was in despair for some days, and then asked myself whether he might not after all have been right. But this use of ‘Mr.,’ if it meant nothing, was at least intelligible. Not so with another that was revealed to me on the occasion of this luncheon-party, but revealed without any indication of its purport. At the moment when I was about to step from the hall into the drawing-room the butler handed me a thin, oblong envelope upon which my name was inscribed. In my surprise I thanked him; but I eyed the envelope with misgivings. I no more knew what I was expected to do with it than a foreigner knows what to do with one of those little utensils that they lay by his place at a Chinese banquet. I noticed that it was gummed down; I was afraid of appearing indiscreet, were I to open it then and there; and so I thrust it into my pocket with an air of knowing all about it. Mme. Swann had written to me a few days before, asking me to come to luncheon with ‘just a few people.’ There were, however, sixteen of us, among whom I never suspected for a moment that I was to find Bergotte. Mme. Swann, who had already ‘named’ me, as she called it, to several of her guests, suddenly, after my name, in the same tone that she had used in uttering it (in fact, as though we were merely two of the guests at her party, who ought each to feel equally flattered on meeting the other), pronounced that of the sweet Singer with the snowy locks. The name Bergotte made me jump like the sound of a revolver fired at me point blank, but instinctively, for appearance’s sake, I bowed; there, straight in front of me, as by one of those conjurers whom we see standing whole and unharmed, in their frock coats, in the smoke of a pistol shot out of which a pigeon has just fluttered, my salute was returned by a young common little thick-set peering person, with a red nose curled like a snail-shell and a black tuft on his chin. I was cruelly disappointed, for what had just vanished in the dust of the explosion was not only the feeble old man, of whom no vestige now remained; there was also the beauty of an immense work which I had contrived to enshrine in the frail and hallowed organism that I had constructed, like a temple, expressly for itself, but for which no room was to be found in the squat figure, packed tight with blood-vessels, bones, muscles, sinews, of the little man with the snub nose and black beard who stood before me. All the Bergotte whom I had slowly and delicately elaborated for myself, drop by drop, like a stalactite, out of the transparent beauty of his books, ceased (I could see at once) to be of any use, the moment I was obliged to include in him the snail-shell nose and to utilise the little black beard; just as we must reject as worthless the solution of a problem the terms of which we have not read in full, having failed to observe that the total must amount to a specified figure. The nose and beard were elements similarly ineluctable, and all the more aggravating in that, while forcing me to reconstruct entirely the personage of Bergotte, they seemed further to imply, to produce, to secrete incessantly a certain quality of mind, alert and self-satisfied, which was not in the picture, for such a mind had no connexion whatever with the sort of intelligence that was diffused throughout those books, so intimately familiar to me, which were permeated by a gentle and godlike wisdom. Starting from them, I should never have arrived at that snail-shell nose; but starting from the nose, which did not appear to be in the slightest degree ashamed of itself, but stood out alone there like a grotesque ornament fastened on his face, I must proceed in a diametrically opposite direction from the work of Bergotte, I must arrive, it would seem, at the mentality of a busy and preoccupied engineer, of the sort who when you accost him in the street thinks it correct to say: “Thanks, and you?” before you have actually inquired of them how they are, or else, if you assure them that you have been charmed to make their acquaintance, respond with an abbreviation which they imagine to be effective, intelligent and up-to-date, inasmuch as it avoids any waste of precious time on vain formalities: “Same here!” Names are, no doubt, but whimsical draughtsmen, giving us of people as well as of places sketches so little like the reality that we often experience a kind of stupor when we have before our eyes, in place of the imagined, the visible world (which, for that matter, is not the true world, our senses being little more endowed than our imagination with the art of portraiture, so little, indeed, that the final and approximately lifelike pictures which we manage to obtain of reality are at least as different from the visible world as that was from the imagined). But in Bergotte’s case, my preconceived idea of him from his name troubled me far less than my familiarity with his work, to which I was obliged to attach, as to the cord of a balloon, the man with the little beard, without knowing whether it would still have the strength to raise him from the ground. It seemed quite clear, however, that it really was he who had written the books that I had so greatly enjoyed, for Mme. Swann having thought it incumbent upon her to tell him of my admiration for one of these, he shewed no surprise that she should have mentioned this to him rather than to any other of the party, nor did he seem to regard her action as due to a misapprehension, but, swelling out the frock coat which he had put on in honour of all these distinguished guests with a body distended in anticipation of the coming meal, while his mind was completely occupied by other, more real and more important considerations, it was only as at some finished episode in his early life, as though one had made an illusion to a costume of the Duc de Guise which he had worn, one season, at a fancy dress ball, that he smiled as he bore his mind back to the idea of his books; which at once began to fall in my estimation (dragging down with them the whole value of Beauty, of the world, of life itself), until they seemed to have been merely the casual amusement of a man with a little beard. I told myself that he must have taken great pains over them, but that, if he had lived upon an island surrounded by beds of pearl-oysters, he would instead have devoted himself to, and would have made a fortune out of, the pearling trade. His work no longer appeared to me so inevitable. And then I asked myself whether originality did indeed prove that great writers were gods, ruling each one over a kingdom that was his alone, or whether all that was not rather make-believe, whether the differences between one man’s book and another’s were not the result of their respective labours rather than the expression of a radical and essential difference between two contrasted personalities

    Meanwhile we had taken our places at the table. By the side of my plate I found a carnation, the stalk of which was wrapped in silver paper. It embarrassed me less than the envelope that had been handed to me in the hall, which, however, I had completely forgotten. This custom, strange as it was to me, became more intelligible when I saw all the male guests take up the similar carnations that were lying by their plates and slip them into the buttonholes of their coats. I did as they had done, with the air of spontaneity that a free-thinker assumes in church, who is not familiar with the order of service but rises when everyone else rises and kneels a moment after everyone else is on his knees. Another usage, equally strange to me but less ephemeral, disquieted me more. On the other side of my plate was a smaller plate, on which was heaped a blackish substance which I did not then know to be caviare. I was ignorant of what was to be done with it but firmly determined not to let it enter my mouth

    Bergotte was sitting not far from me and I could hear quite well everything that he said. I understood then the impression that M. de Norpois had formed of him. He had indeed a peculiar ‘organ’; there is nothing that so much alters the material qualities of the voice as the presence of thought behind what one is saying; the resonance of one’s diphthongs, the energy of one’s labials are profoundly affected — in fact, one’s whole way of speaking. His seemed to me to differ entirely from his way of writing, and even the things that he said from those with which he filled his books. But the voice issues from behind a mask through which it is not powerful enough to make us recognise, at first sight, a face which we have seen uncovered in the speaker’s literary style. At certain pobts in the conversation, when Bergotte, by force of habit, began to talk in a way which no one but M. de Norpois would have thought affected or unpleasant, it was a long time before I discovered an exact correspondence with the parts of his books in which his form became so poetic and so musical. At those points I could see in what he was saying a plastic beauty independent of whatever his sentences might mean, and as human speech reflects the human soul, though without expressing it as does literary style, Bergotte appeared almost to be talking nonsense, intoning certain words and, if he were secretly pursuing, beneath them, a single image, stringing them together uninterruptedly on one continuous note, with a wearisome monotony. So that a pretentious, emphatic and monotonous opening was a sign of the rare aesthetic value of what he was saying, and an effect, in his conversation, of the same power which, in his books, produced that harmonious flow of imagery. I had had all the more difficulty in discovering this at first since what he said at such moments, precisely because it was the authentic utterance of Bergotte, had not the appearance of being Bergotte’s. It was an abundant crop of clearly defined ideas, not included in that ‘Bergotte manner’ which so many story-tellers had appropriated to themselves; and this dissimilarity was probably but another aspect — made out with difficulty through the stream of conversation, as an eclipse is seen through a smoked glass — of the fact that when one read a page of Bergotte it was never just what would have been written by any of those lifeless imitators who, nevertheless, in newspapers and in books, adorned their prose with so many ‘Bergottish’ images and ideas. This difference in style arose from the fact that what was meant by ‘Bergottism’ was, first and foremost, a priceless element of truth hidden in the heart of everything, whence it was extracted by that great writer, by virtue of his genius, and that this extraction, and not simply the perpetration of ‘Bergottisms,’ was my sweet Singer’s aim in writing. Though, it must be added, he continued to perpetrate them in spite of himself, and because he was Bergotte, so that, in one sense, every fresh beauty in his work was the little drop of Bergotte buried at the heart of a thing which he had distilled from it. But if, for that reason, each of those beauties was related to all the rest, and had a ‘family likeness,’ yet each remained separate and individual, as was the act of discovery that had brought it to the light of day; new, and consequently different from what was called the Bergotte manner, which was a loose synthesis of all the ‘Bergottisms’ already invented and set forth by him in writing, with no indication by which men who lacked genius might forecast what would be his next discovery. So it is with all great writers, the beauty of their language is as incalculable as that of a woman whom we have never seen; it is creative, because it is applied to an external object of which, and not of their language or its beauty, they are thinking, to which they have not yet given expression. An author of memorials of our time, wishing to write without too obviously seeming to be writing like Saint-Simon, might, on occasion, give us the first line of his portrait of Villars: “He was a rather tall man, dark . . . with an alert, open, expressive physiognomy,” but what law of determinism could bring him to the discovery of Saint-Simon’s next line, which begins with “and, to tell the truth, a trifle mad”? The true variety is in this abundance of real and unexpected elements, in the branch loaded with blue flowers which thrusts itself forward, against all reason, from the spring hedgerow that seemed already overcharged with blossoms, whereas the purely formal imitation of variety (and one might advance the same argument for all the other qualities of style) is but a barren uniformity, that is to say the very antithesis of variety, and cannot, in the work of imitators, give the illusion or recall other examples of variety save to a reader who has not acquired the sense of it from the masters themselves

    And so — just as Bergotte’s way of speaking would no doubt have been charming if he himself had been merely an amateur repeating imitations of Bergotte, whereas it was attached to the mind of Bergotte, at work and in action, by essential ties which the ear did not at once distinguish — so it was because Bergotte applied that mind with precision to the reality which pleased him that his language had in it something positive, something over-rich, disappointing those who expected to hear him speak only of the ‘eternal torrent of forms,’ and of the ‘mystic thrills of beauty.’ Moreover the quality, always rare and new, of what he wrote was expressed in his conversation by so subtle a manner of approaching a question, ignoring every aspect of it that was already familiar, that he appeared to be seizing hold of an unimportant detail, to be quite wrong about it, to be speaking in paradox, so that his ideas seemed as often as not to be in confusion, for each of us finds lucidity only in those ideas which are in the same state of confusion as his own. Besides, as all novelty depends upon the elimination, first, of the stereotyped attitude to which we have grown accustomed, and which has seemed to us to be reality itself, every new conversation, as well as all original painting and music, must always appear laboured and tedious. It is founded upon figures of speech with which we are not familiar, the speaker appears to us to be talking entirely in metaphors; and this wearies us, and gives us the impression of a want of truth. (After all, the old forms of speech must in their time have been images difficult to follow when the listener was not yet cognisant of the universe which they depicted. But he has long since decided that this must be the real universe, and so relies confidently upon it.) So when Bergotte — and his figures appear simple enough to-day — said of Cottard that he was a mannikin in a bottle, always trying to rise to the surface, and of Brichot that “to him even more than to Mme. Swann the arrangement of his hair was a matter for anxious deliberation, because, in his twofold preoccupation over his profile and his reputation, he had always to make sure that it was so brushed as to give him the air at once of a lion and of a philosopher,” one immediately felt the strain, and sought a foothold upon something which one called more concrete, meaning by that more ordinary. These unintelligible words, issuing from the mask that I had before my eyes, it was indeed to the writer whom I admired that they must be attributed, and yet they could not have been inserted among his books, in the form of a puzzle set in a series of different puzzles, they occupied another plane and required a transposition by means of which, one day, when I was repeating to myself certain phrases that I had heard Bergotte use, I discovered in them the whole machinery of his literary style, the different elements of which I was able to recognise and to name in this spoken discourse which had struck me as being so different

    >From a less immediate point of view the special way, a little too meticulous, too intense, that he had of pronouncing certain words, certain adjectives which were constantly recurring in his conversation, and which he never uttered without a certain emphasis, giving to each of their syllables a separate force and intoning the last syllable (as for instance the word visage, which he always used in preference to figure, and enriched with a number of superfluous v’s and s’s and g’s, which seemed all to explode from his outstretched palm at such moments) corresponded exactly to the fine passages in which, in his prose, he brought those favourite words into the light, preceded by a sort of margin and composed in such a way in the metrical whole of the phrase that the reader was obliged, if he were not to make a false quantity, to give to each of them its full value. And yet one did not find in the speech of Bergotte a certain luminosity which in his books, as in those of some other writers, often modified in the written phrase the appearance of its words. This was doubtless because that light issues from so profound a depth that its rays do not penetrate to our spoken words in the hours in which, thrown open to others by the act of conversation, we are to a certain extent closed against ourselves. In this respect, there were more intonations, there was more accent in his books than in his talk; an accent independent of the beauty of style, which the author himself has possibly not perceived, for it is not separable from his most intimate personality. It was this accent which, at the moments when, in his books, Bergotte was entirely natural, gave a rhythm to the words — often at such times quite insignificant — that he wrote. This accent is not marked on the printed page, there is nothing there to indicate it, and yet it comes of its own accord to his phrases, one cannot pronounce them in any other way, it is what was most ephemeral and at the same time most profound in the writer, and it is what will bear witness to his true nature, what will say whether, despite all the austerity that he has expressed he was gentle, despite all his sensuality sentimental

    Certain peculiarities of elocution, faint traces of which were to be found in Bergotte’s conversation, were not exclusively his own; for when, later on, I came to know his brothers and sisters, I found those peculiarities much more accentuated in their speech. There was something abrupt and harsh in the closing words of a light and spirited utterance, something faint and dying at the end of a sad one. Swann, who had known the Master as a boy, told me that in those days one used to hear on his lips, just as much as on his brothers’ and sisters’, those inflexions, almost a family type, shouts of violent merriment interspersed with murmurings of a long-drawn melancholy, and that in the room in which they all played together he used to perform his part, better than any of them, in their symphonies, alternately deafening and subdued. However characteristic it may be, the sound that escapes from human lips is fugitive and does not survive the speaker. But it was not so with the pronunciation of the Bergotte family. For if it is difficult ever to understand, even in the Meistersinger, how an artist can invent music by listening to the twittering of birds, yet Bergotte had transposed and fixed in his written language that manner of dwelling on words which repeat themselves in shouts of joy, or fall, drop by drop, in melancholy sighs. There are in his books just such closing phrases where the accumulated sounds are prolonged (as in the last chords of the overture of an opera which cannot come to an end, and repeats several times over its supreme cadence before the conductor finally lays down his baton), in which, later on, I was to find a musical equivalent for those phonetic ‘brasses’ of the Bergotte family. But in his own case, from the moment in which he transferred them to his books, he ceased instinctively to make use of them in his speech. From the day on which he had begun to write — all the more markedly, therefore, in the later years in which I first knew him — his voice had lost this orchestration for ever

    These young Bergottes — the future writer and his brothers and sisters — were doubtless in no way superior, far from it, to other young people, more refined, more intellectual than themselves, who found the Bergottes rather ‘loud that is to say a trifle vulgar, irritating one by the witticisms which characterised the tone, at once pretentious and puerile, of their household. But genius, and even what is only great talent, springs less from seeds of intellect and social refinement superior to those of other people than from the faculty of transposing, and so transforming them. To heat a liquid over an electric lamp one requires to have not the strongest lamp possible, but one of which the current can cease to illuminate, can be diverted so as instead of light to give heat. To mount the skies it is not necessary to have the most powerful of motors, one must have a motor which, instead of continuing to run along the earth’s surface, intersecting with a vertical line the horizontal which it began by following, is capable of converting its speed into ascending force. Similarly the men who produce works of genius are not those who live in the most delicate atmosphere, whose conversation is most brilliant or their culture broadest, but those who have had the power, ceasing in a moment to live only for themselves, to make use of their personality as of a mirror, m such a way that their life, however unimportant it may be socially, and even, in a sense, intellectually speaking, is reflected by it, genius consisting in the reflective power of the writer and not in the intrinsic quality of the scene reflected. The day on which young Bergotte succeeded in shewing to the world of his readers the tasteless household in which he had passed his childhood, and the not very amusing conversations between himself and his brothers, on that day he climbed far above the friends of his family, more intellectual and more distinguished than himself; they in their fine Rolls Royces might return home expressing due contempt for the vulgarity of the Bergottes; but he, with his modest engine which had at last left the ground, he soared above their heads

    But there were other characteristics of his elocution which it was not with the members of his family, but with certain contemporary writers, that he must share. Younger men, who were beginning to repudiate him as a master and disclaimed any intellectual affinity to him in themselves, displayed their affinity without knowing it when they made use of the same adverbs, the same prepositions that he incessantly repeated, when they constructed their sentences in the same way, spoke in the same quiescent, lingering tone, by a reaction from the eloquent, easy language of an earlier generation. Perhaps these young men — we shall come across some of whom this may be said — had never known Bergotte. But his way of thinking, inoculated into them, had led them to those alterations of syntax and of accent which bear a necessary relation to originality of mind. A relation which, incidentally, requires to be traced. Thus Bergotte, if he owed nothing to any man for his manner of writing, derived his manner of speaking from one of his early associates, a marvellous talker to whose ascendancy he had succumbed, whom he imitated, unconsciously, in his conversation, but who himself, being less gifted, had never written any really outstanding book. So that if one had been in quest of originality in speech, Bergotte must have been labelled a disciple, a writer at second-hand, whereas, influenced by his friend only so far as talk went, he had been original and creative in his writings. Doubtless again, so as to distinguish himself from the previous generation, too fond as it had been of abstractions, of weighty commonplaces, when Bergotte wished to speak favourably of a book, what he would bring into prominence, what he would quote with approval would always be some scene that furnished the reader with an image, some picture that had no rational significance. “Ah, yes!” he would exclaim, “it is quite admirable! There is a little girl in an orange shawl. It is excellent!” or again, “Oh, yes, there is a passage in which there is a regiment marching along the street; yes, it is excellent!” As for style, he was not altogether of his time (though he remained quite exclusively of his race, abominating Tolstoy, George Eliot, Ibsen and Dostoievsky), for the word that always came to his lips when he wished to praise the style of any writer was ‘mild.’ “Yes, you know I like Chateaubriand better in Atalathan in René; he seems to me to be ‘milder.’” He said the word like a doctor who, when his patient assures him that milk will give him indigestion, answers, “But, you know, it’s very ‘mild’.” And it is true that there was in Bergotte’s style a kind of harmony similar to that for which the ancients used to praise certain of their orators in terms which we now find it hard to understand, accustomed as we are to our own modern tongues in which effects of that kind are not sought

    He would say also, with a shy smile, of pages of his own for which some one had expressed admiration: “I think it is more or less true, more or less accurate; it may be of some value perhaps,” but he would say this simply from modesty, as a woman to whom one has said that her dress, or her daughter, is charming replies, “It is comfortable,” or “She is a good girl.” But the constructive instinct was too deeply implanted in Bergotte for him not to be aware that the sole proof that he had built usefully and on the lines of truth lay in the pleasure that his work had given, to himself first of all and afterwards to his readers. Only many years later, when he no longer had any talent, whenever he wrote anything with which he was not satisfied, so as not to have to suppress it, as he ought to have done, so as to be able to publish it with a clear conscience he would repeat, but to himself this time: “After all, it is more or less accurate, it must be of some value to the country.” So that the phrase murmured long ago among his admirers by the insincere voice of modesty came in the end to be whispered in the secrecy of his heart by the uneasy tongue of pride. And the same words which had served Bergotte as an unwanted excuse for the excellence of his earliest works became as it were an ineffective consolation to him for the hopeless mediocrity of the latest

    A kind of austerity of taste which he had, a kind of determination to write nothing of which he could not say that it was ‘mild,’ which had made people for so many years regard him as a sterile and precious artist, a chiseller of exquisite trifles, was on the contrary the secret of his strength, for habit forms the style of the writer just as much as the character of the man, and the author who has more than once been patient to attain, in the expression of his thoughts, to a certain kind of attractiveness, in so doing lays down unalterably the boundaries of his talent, just as if he yields too often to pleasure, to laziness, to the fear of being put to trouble, he will find himself describing in terms which no amount of revision can modify, the forms of his own vices and the limits of his virtue

    If, however, despite all the analogies which I was to perceive later on between the writer and the man, I had not at first sight, in Mme. Swann’s drawing-room, believed that this could be Bergotte, the author of so many divine books, who stood before me, perhaps I was not altogether wrong, for he himself did not, in the strict sense of the word, ‘believe’ it either. He did not believe it because he shewed a great assiduity in the presence of fashionable people (and yet he was not a snob), of literary men and journalists who were vastly inferior to himself. Of course he had long since learned, from the suffrage of his readers, that he had genius, compared to which social position and official rank were as nothing. He had learned that he had genius, but he did not believe it because he continued to simulate deference towards mediocre writers in order to succeed, shortly, in becoming an Academician, whereas the Academy and the Faubourg Saint-Germain have no more to do with that part of the Eternal Mind which is the author of the works of Bergotte than with the law of causality or the idea of God. That also he knew, but as a kleptomaniac knows, without profiting by the knowledge, that it is wrong to steal. And the man with the little beard and snail-shell nose knew and used all the tricks of the gentleman who pockets your spoons, in his efforts to reach the coveted academic chair, or some duchess or other who could dispose of several votes at the election, but while on his way to them he would endeavour to make sure that no one who would consider the pursuit of such an object a vice in him should see what he was doing. He was only half-successful; one could hear, alternating with the speech of the true Bergotte, that of the other Bergotte, ambitious, utterly selfish, who thought it not worth his while to speak of any but his powerful, rich or noble friends, so as to enhance his own position, he who in his books, when he was really himself, had so well portrayed the charm, pure as a mountain spring, of poverty

    As for those other vices to which M. de Norpois had alluded, that almost incestuous love, which was made still worse, people said, by a want of delicacy in the matter of money, if they contradicted, in a shocking manner, the tendency of his latest novels, in which he shewed everywhere a regard for what was right and proper so painfully rigid that the most innocent pleasures of their heroes were poisoned by it, and that even the reader found himself turning their pages with a sense of acute discomfort, and asked himself whether it was possible to go on living even the quietest of lives, those vices did not at all prove, supposing that they were fairly imputed to Bergotte, that his literature was a lie and all his sensitiveness mere play-acting. Just as in pathology certain conditions similar in appearance are due, some to an excess, others to an insufficiency of tension, of secretion and so forth, so there may be vice arising from supersensitiveness just as much as from the lack of it. Perhaps it is only in really vicious lives that the moral problem can arise in all its disquieting strength. And of this problem the artist finds a solution in the terms not of his own personal life but of what is for him the true life, a general, a literary solution. As the great Doctors of the Church began often, without losing their virtue, by acquainting themselves with the sins of all mankind, out of which they extracted their own personal sanctity, so great artists often, while being thoroughly wicked, make use of their vices in order to arrive at a conception of the moral law that is binding upon us all. It is the vices (or merely the weaknesses and follies) of the circle in which they live, the meaningless conversation, the frivolous or shocking lives of their daughters, the infidelity of their wives, or their own misdeeds that writers have most often castigated in their books, without, however, thinking it necessary to alter their domestic economy or to improve the tone of their households. And this contrast had never before been so striking as it was in Bergotte’s time, because, on the one hand, in proportion as society grew more corrupt, our notions of morality were increasingly exalted, while on the other hand the public were now told far more than they had ever hitherto known about the private lives of literary men; and on certain evenings in the theatre people would point out the author whom I had so greatly admired at Combray, sitting at the back of a box the mere composition of which seemed an oddly humorous, or perhaps keenly ironical commentary upon — a brazen-faced denial of — the thesis which he had just been maintaining in his latest book. Not that anything which this or that casual informant could tell me was of much use in helping me to settle the question of the goodness or wickedness of Bergotte. An intimate friend would furnish proofs of his hardheartedness; then a stranger would cite some instance (touching, since he had evidently wished it to remain hidden) of his real depth of feeling. He had behaved cruelly to his wife. But in a village inn, where he had gone to spend the night, he had stayed on to watch over a poor woman who had tried to drown herself, and when he was obliged to continue his journey had left a large sum of money with the landlord, so that he should not turn the poor creature out, but see that she got proper attention. Perhaps the more the great writer was developed in Bergotte at the expense of the little man with the beard, so much the more his own personal life was drowned in the flood of all the lives that he imagined, until he no longer felt himself obliged to perform certain practical duties, for which he had substituted the duty of imagining those other lives. But at the same time, because he imagined the feelings of others as completely as if they had been his own, whenever he was obliged, for any reason, to talk to some person who had been unfortunate (that is to say in a casual encounter) he would, in doing so, take up not his own personal standpoint but that of the sufferer himself, a standpoint in which he would have been horrified by the speech of those who continued to think of their own petty concerns in the presence of another’s grief. With the result that he gave rise everywhere to justifiable rancour and to undying gratitude

    Above all, he was a man who in his heart of hearts loved nothing really except certain images and (like a miniature set in the floor of a casket) the composing and painting of them in words. For a trifle that some one had sent him, if that trifle gave him the opportunity of introducing one or two of these images, he would be prodigal in the expression of his gratitude, while shewing none whatever for an expensive present. And if he had had to plead before a tribunal, he would inevitably have chosen his words not for the effect that they might have on the judge but with an eye to certain images which the judge would certainly never have perceived

    That first day on which I met him with Gilberte’s parents, I mentioned to Bergotte that I had recently been to hear Berma in Phèdre; and he told me that in the scene in which she stood with her arm raised to the level of her shoulder — one of those very scenes that had been greeted with such applause — she had managed to suggest with great nobility of art certain classical figures which, quite possibly, she had never even seen, a Hesperid carved in the same attitude upon a metope at Olympia, and also the beautiful primitive virgins on the Erechtheum

    “It may be sheer divination, and yet I fancy that she visits the museums. It would be interesting to ‘establish’ that.” (‘Establish’ was one of those regular Bergotte expressions, and one which various young men who had never met him had caught from him, speaking like him by some sort of telepathic suggestion.)

    “Do you mean the Cariatides?” asked Swann

    “No, no,” said Bergotte, “except in the scene where she confesses her passion to Oenone, where she moves her hand exactly like Hegeso on the stele in the Ceramic, it is a far more primitive art that she revives. I was referring to the Korai of the old Erechtheum, and I admit that there is perhaps nothing quite so remote from the art of Racine, but there are so many things already in Phèdre, . . . that one more . . . Oh, and then, yes, she is really charming, that little sixth century Phaedra, the rigidity of the arm, the lock of hair ‘frozen into marble,’ yes, you know, it is wonderful of her to have discovered all that. There is a great deal more antiquity in it than in most of the books they are labelling ‘antique’ this year.”

    As Bergotte had in one of his volumes addressed a famous invocation to these archaic statues, the words that he was now uttering were quite intelligible to me and gave me a fresh reason for taking an interest in Berma’s acting. I tried to picture her again in my mind, as she had looked in that scene in which I remembered that she had raised her arm to the level of her shoulder. And I said to myself, “There we have the Hesperid of Olympia; there we have the sister of those adorable suppliants on the Acropolis; there is indeed nobility in art!” But if these considerations were to enhance for me the beauty of Berma’s gesture, Bergotte should have put them into my head before the performance. Then, while that attitude of the actress was actually existing in flesh and blood before my eyes, at that moment in which the thing that was happening had still the substance of reality, I might have tried to extract from it the idea of archaic sculpture. But of Berma in that scene all that I retained was a memory which was no longer liable to modification, slender as a picture which lacks that abundant perspective of the present tense where one is free to delve and can always discover something new, a picture to which one cannot retrospectively give a meaning that is not subject to verification and correction from without. At this point Mme. Swann joined in the conversation, asking me whether Gilberte had remembered to give me what Bergotte had written aboutPhèdre, and adding, “My daughter is such a scatter-brain!” Bergotte smiled modestly and protested that they were only a few pages, of no importance. “But it is perfectly charming, that little pamphlet, that little ‘tract’ of yours!” Mme. Swann assured him, to shew that she was a good hostess, to make the rest of us think that she had read Bergotte’s essay, and also because she liked not merely to flatter Bergotte, but to make a selection for herself out of what he wrote, to control his writing. And it must be admitted that she did inspire him, though not in the way that she supposed. But when all is said there is, between what constituted the smartness of Mme. Swann’s drawing-room and a whole side of Bergotte’s work, so close a correspondence that either of them might serve among elderly men to-day, as a commentary upon the other

    I let myself go in telling him what my impressions had been. Often Bergotte disagreed, but he allowed me to go on talking. I told him that I had liked the green light which was turned on when Phaedra raised her arm. “Ah! The designer will be glad to hear that; he is a real artist. I shall tell him you liked it, because he is very proud of that effect. I must say, myself, that I do not care for it very much, it drowns everything in a sort of aqueous vapour, little Phaedra standing there looks too like a branch of coral on the floor of an aquarium. You will tell me, of course, that it brings out the cosmic aspect of the play. That is quite true. All the same, it would be more appropriate if the scene were laid in the Court of Neptune. Oh yes, of course, I know the Vengeance of Neptune does come into the play. I don’t suggest for a moment that we should think only of Port-Royal, but after all the story that Racine tells us is not the ‘Loves of the Sea-Urchins.’ Still, it is what my friend wished to have, and it is very well done, right or wrong, and it’s really quite pretty when you come to look at it. Yes, so you liked that, did you; you understood what it meant, of course; we feel the same about it, don’t we, really; it is a trifle unbalanced, what he’s done, you agree with me, but on the whole it is very clever of him.” And so, when Bergotte had to express an opinion which was the opposite of my own, he in no way reduced me to silence, to the impossibility of framing any reply, as M. de Norpois would have done. This does not prove that Bergotte’s opinions were of less value than the Ambassador’s; far from it. A powerful idea communicates some of its strength to him who challenges it. Being itself a part of the riches of the universal Mind, it makes its way into, grafts itself upon the mind of him whom it is employed to refute, slips in among the ideas already there, with the help of which, gaining a little ground, he completes and corrects it; so that the final utterance is always to some extent the work of both parties to a discussion. It is to ideas which are not, properly speaking, ideas at all, to ideas which, founded upon nothing, can find no support, no kindred spirit among the ideas of the adversary, that he, grappling with something which is not there, can find no word to say in answer. The arguments of M. de Norpois (in the matter of art) were unanswerable simply because they were without reality

    Since Bergotte did not sweep aside my objections, I confessed to him that they had won the scorn of M. de Norpois. “But he’s an old parrot!” was the answer. “He keeps on pecking you because he imagines all the time that you’re a piece of cake, or a slice of cuttle-fish.” “What’s that?” asked Swann. “Are you a friend of Norpois?” “He’s as dull as a wet Sunday,” interrupted his wife, who had great faith in Bergotte’s judgment, and was no doubt afraid that M. de Norpois might have spoken ill of her to us. “I tried to make him talk after dinner; I don’t know if it’s his age or his indigestion, but I found him too sticky for words. I really thought I should have to ‘dope’ him.” “Yes, isn’t he?” Bergotte chimed in. “You see, he has to keep his mouth shut half the time so as not to use up all the stock of inanities that hold his shirt-front down and his white waistcoat up.” “I think that Bergotte and my wife are both very hard on him,” came from Swann, who took the ‘line,’ in his own house, of a plain, sensible man. “I quite see that Norpois cannot interest you very much, but from another point of view,” (for Swann made a hobby of collecting scraps of ‘real life’) “he is quite remarkable, quite a remarkable instance of a lover. When he was Secretary at Rome,” he went on, after making sure that Gilberte could not hear him, “he had, here in Paris, a mistress with whom he was madly in love, and he found time to make the double journey every week, so as to see her for a couple of hours. She was, as it happens, a most intelligent woman, and is quite attractive to this day; she is a dowager now. And he has had any number of others since then. I’m sure I should have gone stark mad if the woman I was in love with lived in Paris and I was kept shut up in Rome. Nervous men ought always to love, as the lower orders say, ‘beneath’ them, so that their women have a material inducement to do what they tell them.” As he spoke, Swann realised that I might be applying this maxim to himself and Odette, and as, even among superior beings, at the moment when you and they seem to be soaring together above the plane of life, their personal pride is still basely human, he was seized by a violent ill-will towards me. But this was made manifest only in the uneasiness of his glance. He said nothing more to me at the time. Not that this need surprise us. When Racine (according to a story the truth of which has been exploded, though the theme of it may be found recurring every day in Parisian life) made an illusion to Scarron in front of Louis XIV, the most powerful monarch on earth said nothing to the poet that evening. It was on the following day, only, that he fell

    But as a theory requires to be stated as a whole, Swann, after this momentary irritation, and after wiping his eyeglass, finished saying what was in his mind in these words, words which were to assume later on in my memory the importance of a prophetic warning, which I had not had the sense to take: “The danger of that kind of love, however, is that the woman’s subjection calms the man’s jealousy for a time but also makes it more exacting. After a little he will force his mistress to live like one of those prisoners whose cells they keep lighted day and night, to prevent their escaping. And that generally ends in trouble.”

    I reverted to M. de Norpois. “You must never trust him; he has the most wicked tongue!” said Mme. Swann in an accent which seemed to me to indicate that M. de Norpois had been ‘saying things’ about her, especially as Swann looked across at his wife with an air of rebuke, as though to stop her before she went too far

    Meanwhile Gilberte, who had been told to go and get ready for our drive, stayed to listen to the conversation, and hovered between her mother and her father, leaning affectionately against his shoulder. Nothing, at first sight, could be in greater contrast to Mme. Swann, who was dark, than this child with her red hair and golden skin. But after looking at them both for a moment one saw in Gilberte many of the features — for instance, the nose cut short with a sharp, unfaltering decision by the unseen sculptor whose chisel repeats its work upon successive generations — the expression, the movements of her mother; to take an illustration from another form of art, she made one think of a portrait that was not a good likeness of Mme. Swann, whom the painter, to carry out some whim of colouring, had posed in a partial disguise, dressed to go out to a party in Venetian ‘character.’ And as not merely was she wearing a fair wig, but every atom of a swarthier complexion had been discharged from her flesh which, stripped of its veil of brownness, seemed more naked, covered simply in rays of light shed by an internal sun, this ‘make-up’ was not just superficial but was incarnate in her; Gilberte had the appearance of embodying some fabulous animal or of having assumed a mythological disguise. This reddish skin was so exactly that of her father that nature seemed to have had, when Gilberte was being created, to solve the problem of how to reconstruct Mme. Swann piecemeal, without any material at her disposal save the skin of M. Swann. And nature had utilised this to perfection, like a master carver who makes a point of leaving the grain, the knots of his wood in evidence. On Gilberte’s face, at the corner of a perfect reproduction of Odette’s nose, the skin was raised so as to preserve intact the two beauty spots of M. Swann. It was a new variety ot Mme. Swann that was thus obtained, growing there by her side like a white lilac-tree beside a purple. At the same time it did not do to imagine the boundary line between these two likenesses as definitely fixed. Now and then, when Gilberte smiled, one could distinguish the oval of her father’s cheek upon her mother’s face, as though some one had mixed them together to see what would result from the blend; this oval grew distinct, as an embryo grows into a living shape, it lengthened obliquely, expanded, and a moment later had disappeared. In Gilberte’s eyes there was the frank and honest gaze of her father; this was how she had looked at me when she gave me the agate marble and said, “Keep it, to remind yourself of our friendship.” But were one to put a question to Gilberte, to ask her what she had been doing, then one saw in those same eyes the embarrassment, the uncertainty, the prevarication, the misery that Odette used in the old days to shew, when Swann asked her where she had been and she gave him one of those lying answers which, in those days, drove the lover to despair and now made him abruptly change the conversation, as an incurious and prudent husband. Often in the Champs-Elysées I was disturbed by seeing this look on Gilberte’s face. But as a rule my fears were unfounded. For in her, a purely physical survival of her mother, this look (if nothing else) had ceased to have any meaning. It was when she had been to her classes, when she must go home for some lesson, that Gilberte’s pupils executed that movement which, in time past, in the eyes of Odette, had been caused by the fear of disclosing that she had, during the day, opened the door to one of her lovers, or was — at that moment in a hurry to be at some trysting-place. So one could see the two natures of M. and Mme. Swann ebb and flow, encroaching alternately one upon the other in the body of this Mélusine

    It is, of course, common knowledge that a child takes after both its-father and its mother. And yet the distribution of the merits and defects which it inherits is so oddly planned that, of two good qualities which seemed inseparable in one of the parents you will find but one in the child, and allied to that very fault in the other parent which seemed most irreconcilable with it. Indeed, the incarnation of a good moral quality in an incompatible physical blemish is often one of the laws of filial resemblance. Of two sisters, one will combine with the proud bearing of her father the mean little soul of her mother; the other, abundantly endowed with the paternal intelligence, will present it to the world in the aspect which her mother has made familiar; her mother’s shapeless nose and scraggy bosom are become the bodily covering of talents which you had learned to distinguish beneath a superb presence. With the result that of each of the sisters one can say with equal justification that it is she who takes more after one or other of her parents. It is true that Gilberte was an only child, but there were, at the least, two Gilbertes. The two natures, her father’s and her mother’s, did more than just blend themselves in her; they disputed the possession of her — and yet one cannot exactly say that, which would let it be thought that a third Gilberte was in the meantime suffering by being the prey of the two others. Whereas Gilberte was alternately one and the other, and at any given moment no more than one of the two, that is to say incapable, when she was not being good, of suffering accordingly, the better Gilberte not being able at the time, on account of her momentary absence, to detect the other’s lapse from virtue. And so the less good of the two was free to enjoy pleasures of an ignoble kind. When the other spoke to you from the heart of her father, she held broad views, you would have liked to engage with her upon a fine and beneficent enterprise; you told her so, but, just as your arrangements were being completed, her mother’s heart would already have resumed its control; hers was the voice that answered; and you were disappointed and vexed — almost baffled, as in the face of a substitution of one person for another — by an unworthy thought, an insincere laugh, in which Gilberte saw no harm, for they sprang from what she herself at that moment was. Indeed, the disparity was at times so great between these two Gilbertes that you asked yourself, though without finding an answer, what on earth you could have said or done to her, last time, to find her now so different. When she herself had arranged to meet you somewhere, not only did she fail to appear, and offer no excuse afterwards, but, whatever the influence might have been that had made her change her mind, she shewed herself in so different a character when you did meet her that you might well have supposed that, taken in by a likeness such as forms the plot of theMenaechmi, you were now talking to some one not the person who had so politely expressed her desire to see you, had she not shewn signs of an ill-humour which revealed that she felt herself to be in the wrong, and wished to avoid the necessity of an explanation

    “Now then, run along and get ready; you’re keeping us waiting,” her mother reminded her

    “I’m so happy here with my little Papa; I want to stay just for a minute,” replied Gilberte, burying her head beneath the arm of her father, who passed his fingers lovingly through her bright hair

    Swann was one of those men who, having lived for a long time amid the illusions of love, have seen the prosperity that they themselves brought to numberless women increase the happiness of those women without exciting in them any gratitude, any tenderness towards their benefactors; but in their child they believe that they can feel an affection which, being incarnate in their own name, will enable them to remain in the world after their death. When there should no longer be any Charles Swann, there would still be a Mlle. Swann, or a Mme. something-else, néeSwann, who would continue to love the vanished father. Indeed, to love him too well, perhaps, Swann may have been thinking, for he acknowledged Gilberte’s caress with a “Good girl!” in that tone, made tender by our apprehension, to which, when we think of the future, we are prompted by the too passionate affection of a creature who is destined to survive us. To conceal his emotion, he joined in our talk about Berma. He pointed out to me, but in a detached, a listless tone, as though he wished to remain to some extent unconcerned in what he was saying, with what intelligence, with what an astonishing fitness the actress said to Oenone, “You knew it!” He was right. That intonation at least had a value that was really intelligible, and might therefore have satisfied my desire to find incontestable reasons for admiring Berma. But it was by the very fact of its clarity that it did not at all content me. Her intonation was so ingenious, so definite in intention and in its meaning, that it seemed to exist by itself, so that any intelligent actress might have learned to use it. It was a fine idea; but whoever else should conceive it as fully must possess it equally. It remained to Berma’s credit that she had discovered it, but is one entitled to use the word ‘discover’ when the object in question is something that would not be different if one had been given it, something that does not belong essentially to one’s own nature seeing that some one else may afterwards reproduce it?

    “Upon my soul, your presence among us does raise the tone of the conversation!” Swann observed to me, as though to excuse himself to Bergotte; for he had formed the habit, in the Guermantes set, of entertaining great artists as if they were just ordinary friends whom one seeks only to make eat the dishes that they like, play the games, or, in the country, indulge in whatever form of sport they please. “It seems to me that we’re talking a great deal of art,” he went on. “But it’s so nice, I do love it!” said Mme. Swann, throwing me a look of gratitude, as well from good nature as because she had not abandoned her old aspirations towards a more intellectual form of conversation. After this it was to others of the party, and principally to Gilberte, that Bergotte addressed himself. I had told him everything that I felt with a freedom which had astonished me, and was due to the fact that, having acquired with him, years before (in the course of all those hours of solitary reading, in which he was to me merely the better part of myself), the habit of sincerity, of frankness, of confidence, I was less frightened by him than by a person with whom I should have been talking for the first time. And yet, for the same reason, I was greatly disturbed by the thought of the impression that I must have been making on him, the contempt that I had supposed he would feel for my ideas dating not from that afternoon but from the already distant time in which I had begun to read his books in our garden at Combray. And yet I ought perhaps to have reminded myself that, since it was in all sincerity, abandoning myself to the train of my thoughts, that I had felt, on the one hand, so intensely in sympathy with the work of Bergotte and on the other hand, in the theatre, a disappointment the reason of which I did not know, those two instinctive movements which had both carried me away could not be so very different from one another, but must be obedient to the same laws; and that that mind of Bergotte which I had loved in his books could not be anything entirely foreign and hostile to my disappointment and to my inability to express it. For my intelligence must be a uniform thing, perhaps indeed there exists but a single intelligence, in which everyone in the world participates, towards which each of us from the position of his own separate body turns his eyes, as in a theatre where, if everyone has his own separate seat, there is on the other hand but a single stage. Of course, the ideas which I was tempted to seek to disentangle were probably not those whose depths Bergotte usually sounded in his books. But if it were one and the same intelligence which we had, he and I, at our disposal, he must, when he heard me express those ideas, be reminded of them, cherish them, smile upon them, keeping probably, in spite of what I supposed, before his mind’s eye a whole world of intelligence other than that an excerpt of which had passed into his books, an excerpt upon which I had based my imagination of his whole mental universe. Just as priests, having the widest experience of the human heart, are best able to pardon the sins which they do not themselves commit, so genius, having the widest experience of the human intelligence, can best understand the ideas most directly in opposition to those which form the foundation of its own writings. I ought to have told myself all this (though, for that matter, it was none too consoling a thought, for the benevolent condescension of great minds has as a corollary the incomprehension and hostility of small; and one derives far less happiness from the friendliness of a great writer, which one finds expressed, failing a more intimate association, in his books, than suffering from the hostility of a woman whom one did not choose for her intelligence but cannot help loving). I ought to have told myself all this, but I did not; I was convinced that I had appeared a fool to Bergotte, when Gilberte whispered in my ear:

    “You can’t think how delighted I am, because you have made a conquest of my great friend Bergotte. He’s been telling Mamma that he found you extremely intelligent.”

    “Where are we going?” I asked her. “Oh, wherever you like; you know, it’s all the same to me.” But since the incident that had occurred on the anniversary of her grandfather’s death I had begun to ask myself whether Gilberte’s character was not other than I had supposed, whether that indifference to what was to be done, that wisdom, that calm, that gentle and constant submission did not indeed conceal passionate longings which her self-esteem would not allow to be visible and which she disclosed only by her sudden resistance whenever by any chance they were frustrated. As Bergotte lived in the same neighbourhood as my parents, we left the house together; in the carriage he spoke to me of my health. “Our friends were telling me that you had been ill. I am very sorry. And yet, after all, I am not too sorry, because I can see quite well that you are able to enjoy the pleasures of the mind, and they are probably what mean most to you, as to everyone who has known them.”

    Alas, what he was saying, how little, I felt, did it apply to myself, whom all reasoning, however exalted it might be, left cold, who was happy only in moments of pure idleness, when I was comfortable and well; I felt how purely material was everything that I desired in life, and how easily I could dispense with the intellect. As I made no distinction among my pleasures between those that came to me from different sources, of varying depth and permanence, I was thinking, when the moment came to answer him, that I should have liked an existence in which I was on intimate terms with the Duchesse de Guermantes, and often came across, as in the old toll-house in the Champs-Elysées, a chilly smell that would remind me of Combray. But in this ideal existence which I dared not confide to him the pleasures of the mind found no place

    “No, sir, the pleasures of the mind count for very little with me; it is not them that I seek after; indeed I don’t even know that I have ever tasted them.”

    “You really think not?” he replied. “Well, it may be, no, wait a minute now, yes, after all that must be what you like best, I can see it now clearly, I am certain of it.”

    As certainly, he did not succeed in convincing me; and yet I was already feeling happier, less restricted. After what M. de Norpois had said to me, I had regarded my moments of dreaming, of enthusiasm, of self-confidence as purely subjective and barren of truth. But according to Bergotte, who appeared to understand my case, it seemed that it was quite the contrary, that the symptom I ought to disregard was, in fact, my doubts, my disgust with myself. Moreover, what he had said about M. de Norpois took most of the sting out of a sentence from which I had supposed that no appeal was possible

    “Are you being properly looked after?” Bergotte asked me. “Who is treating you?” I told him that I had seen, and should probably go on seeing, Cottard. “But that’s not at all the sort of man you want!” he told me. “I know nothing about him as a doctor. But I’ve met him at Mme. Swann’s. The man’s an imbecile. Even supposing that that doesn’t prevent his being a good doctor, which I hesitate to believe, it does prevent his being a good doctor for artists, for men of intelligence. People like you must have suitable doctors, I would almost go so far as to say treatment and medicines specially adapted to themselves. Cottard will bore you, and that alone will prevent his treatment from having any effect. Besides, the proper course of treatment cannot possibly be the same for you as for any Tom, Dick or Harry. Nine tenths of the ills from which intelligent people suffer spring from their intellect. They need at least a doctor who understands their disease. How do you expect that Cottard should be able to treat you, he has made allowances for the difficulty of digesting sauces, for gastric trouble, but he has made no allowance for the effect of reading Shakespeare. So that his calculations are inaccurate in your case, the balance is upset; you see, always the little bottle-imp bobbing up again. He will find that you have a dilated stomach; he has no need to examine you for it, since he has it already in his eye. You can see it there, reflected in his glasses.” This manner of speaking tired me greatly; I said to myself, with the stupidity of common sense: “There is no more any dilated stomach reflected in Professor Cottard’s glasses than there are inanities stored behind the white waistcoat of M. de Norpois.” “I should recommend you, instead,” went on Bergotte, “to consult Dr. du Boulbon, who is quite an intelligent man.” “He is a great admirer of your books,” I replied. I saw that Bergotte knew this, and I decided that kindred spirits soon come together, that one has few really ‘unknown friends.’ What Bergotte had said to me with respect to Cottard impressed me, while running contrary to everything that I myself believed. I was in no way disturbed by finding my doctor a bore; I expected of him that, thanks to an art the laws of which were beyond me, he should pronounce on the subject of my health an infallible oracle, after consultation of my entrails. And I did not at all require that, with the aid of an intellect, in which I easily outstripped him, he should seek to understand my intellect, which I pictured to myself merely as a means, of no importance in itself, of trying to attain to certain external verities. I doubted greatly whether intellectual people required a different form of hygiene from imbeciles, and I was quite prepared to submit myself to the latter kind. “I’ll tell you who does need a good doctor, and that is our friend Swann,” said Bergotte. And on my asking whether he was ill, “Well, don’t you see, he’s typical of the man who has married a whore, and has to swallow a hundred serpents every day, from women who refuse to meet his wife, or men who were there before him. You can see them in his mouth, writhing. Just look, any day you’re there, at the way he lifts his eyebrows when he comes in, to see who’s in the room.” The malice with which Bergotte spoke thus to a stranger of the friends in whose house he had so long been received as a welcome guest was as new to me as the almost amorous tone which, in that house, he had constantly been adopting to speak to them. Certainly a person like my great-aunt, for instance, would have been incapable of treating any of us with that politeness which I had heard Bergotte lavishing upon Swann. Even to the people whom she liked, she enjoyed saying disagreeable things. But behind their backs she would never have uttered a word to which they might not have listened. There was nothing less like the social ‘world’ than our society at Combray. The Swanns’ house marked a stage on the way towards it, towards its inconstant tide. If they had not yet reached the open sea, they were certainly in the lagoon. “This is all between ourselves,” said Bergotte as he left me outside my own door. A few years later I should have answered: “I never repeat things.” That is the ritual phrase of society, from which the slanderer always derives a false reassurance. It is what I should have said then and there to Bergotte, for one does not invent all one’s speeches, especially when one is acting merely as a card in the social pack. But I did not yet know the formula. What my great-aunt, on the other hand, would have said on a similar occasion was: “If you don’t wish it to be repeated, why do you say it?” That is the answer of the unsociable, of the quarrelsome. I was nothing of that sort: I bowed my head in silence

    Men of letters who were in my eyes persons of considerable importance had had to plot for years before they succeeded in forming with Bergotte relations which continued to the end to be but dimly literary, and never emerged beyond the four walls of his study, whereas I, I had now been installed among the friends of the great writer, at the first attempt and without any effort, like a man who, instead of standing outside in a crowd for hours in order to secure a bad seat in a theatre, is shewn in at once to the best, having entered by a door that is closed to the public. If Swann had thus opened such a door to me, it was doubtless because, just as a king finds himself naturally inviting his children’s friends into the royal box, or on board the royal yacht, so Gilberte’s parents received their daughter’s friends among all the precious things that they had in their house, and the even more precious intimacies that were enshrined there. But at that time I thought, and perhaps was right in thinking, that this friendliness on Swann’s part was aimed indirectly at my parents. I seemed to remember having heard once at Combray that he had suggested to them that, in view of my admiration for Bergotte, he should take me to dine with him, and that my parents had declined, saying that I was too young, and too easily excited to ‘go out’ yet. My parents, no doubt, represented to certain other people (precisely those who seemed to me the most marvellous) something quite different from what they were to me, so that, just as when the lady in pink had paid my father a tribute of which he had shewn himself so unworthy, I should have wished them to understand what an inestimable present I had just received, and to testify their gratitude to that generous and courteous Swann who had offered it to me, or to them rather, without seeming any more to be conscious of its value than is, in Luini’s fresco, the charming Mage with the arched nose and fair hair, to whom, it appeared, Swann had at one time been thought to bear a striking resemblance

    Unfortunately, this favour that Swann had done me, which, as I entered the house, before I had even taken off my greatcoat, I reported to my parents, in the hope that it would awaken in their hearts an emotion equal to my own, and would determine them upon some immense and decisive act of politeness towards the Swanns, did not appear to be greatly appreciated by them. “Swann introduced you to Bergotte? An excellent friend for you, charming society!” cried my father, ironically. “It only wanted that!” Alas, when I had gone on to say that Bergotte was by no means inclined to admire M. de Norpois:

    “I dare say!” retorted my father. “That simply proves that he’s a foolish and evil-minded fellow. My poor boy, you never had much common sense, still, I’m sorry to see you fall among a set that will finish you off altogether.”

    Already the mere fact of my frequenting the Swanns had been far from delighting my parents. This introduction to Bergotte seemed to them a fatal but natural consequence of an original mistake, namely their own weakness in controlling me, which my grandfather would have called a ‘want of circumspection.’ I felt that I had only, in order to complete their ill humour, to tell them that this perverse fellow who did not appreciate M. de Norpois had found me extremely intelligent. For I had observed that whenever my father decided that anyone, one of my school friends for instance, was going astray — as I was at that moment — if that person had the approval of somebody whom my father did not rate high, he would see in this testimony the confirmation of his own stern judgment. The evil merely seemed to him more pronounced. I could hear him already exclaiming, “Of course, it all hangs together,” an expression that terrified me by the vagueness and vastness of the reforms the introduction of which into my quiet life it seemed to threaten. But since, were I not to tell them what Bergotte had said of me, even then nothing could efface the impression my parents had formed, that this should be made slightly worse mattered little. Besides, they seemed to me so unfair, so completely mistaken, that not only had I not any hope, I had scarcely any desire to bring them to a more equitable point of view. At the same time, feeling, as the words came from my lips, how alarmed they would be by the thought that I had found favour in the sight of a person who dismissed clever men as fools and had earned the contempt of all decent people, praise from whom, since it seemed to me a thing to be desired, would only encourage me in wrongdoing, it was in faltering tones and with a slightly shamefaced air that, coming to the end of my story, I flung them the bouquet of: “He told the Swanns that he had found me extremely intelligent.” Just as a poisoned dog, in a field, rushes, without knowing why, straight to the grass which is the precise antidote to the toxin that he has swallowed, so I, without in the least suspecting it, had said the one thing in the world that was capable of overcoming in my parents this prejudice with respect to Bergotte, a prejudice which all the best reasons that I could have urged, all the tributes that I could have paid him, must have proved powerless to defeat. Instantly the situation changed

    “Oh! He said that he found you intelligent,” repeated my mother. “I am glad to hear that, because he is a man of talent.”

    “What! He said that, did he?” my father joined in. “I don’t for a moment deny his literary distinction, before which the whole world bows; only it is a pity that he should lead that scarcely reputable existence to which old Norpois made a guarded allusion, when he was here,” he went on, not seeing that against the sovran virtue of the magic words which I had just repeated the depravity of Bergotte’s morals was little more able to contend than the falsity of his judgment

    But, my dear,” Mamma interrupted, “we’ve no proof that it’s true. People say all sorts of things. Besides M. de Norpois may have the most perfect manners in the world, but he’s not always very good-natured, especially about people who are not exactly his sort.”

    “That’s quite true; I’ve noticed it myself,” my father admitted

    “And then, too, a great deal ought to be forgiven Bergotte, since he thinks well of my little son,” Mamma went on, stroking my hair with her fingers and fastening upon me a long and pensive gaze

    My mother had not, indeed, awaited this verdict from Bergotte before telling me that I might ask Gilberte to tea whenever I had friends coming. But I dared not do so for two reasons. The first was that at Gilberte’s there was never anything else to drink but tea. Whereas at home Mamma insisted on there being a pot of chocolate as well. I was afraid that Gilberte might regard this as ‘common’; and so conceive a great contempt for us. The other reason was a formal difficulty, a question of procedure which I could never succeed in settling. When I arrived at Mme. Swann’s she used to ask me: “And how is your mother?” I had made several overtures to Mamma to find out whether she would do the same when Gilberte came to us, a point which seemed to me more serious than, at the Court of Louis XIV, the use of ‘Monseigneur.’ But Mamma would not hear of it for a moment

    “Certainly not. I do not know Mme. Swann.”

    “But neither does she know you.”

    “I never said she did, but we are not obliged to behave in exactly the same way about everything. I shall find other ways of being civil to Gilberte than Mme. Swann has with you.”

    But I was unconvinced, and preferred not to invite Gilberte

    Leaving my parents, I went upstairs to change my clothes and on emptying my pockets came suddenly upon the envelope which the Swanns’ butler had handed me before shewing me into the drawing-room. I was now alone. I opened it; inside was a card on which I was told the name of the lady whom I ought to have ‘taken in’ to luncheon

    It was about this period that Bloch overthrew my conception of the world and opened for me fresh possibilities of happiness (which, for that matter, were to change later on into possibilities of suffering), by assuring me that, in contradiction of all that I had believed at the time of my walks along the Méséglise way, women never asked for anything better than to make love. He added to this service a second, the value of which I was not to appreciate until much later; it was he who took me for the first time into a disorderly house. He had indeed told me that there were any number of pretty women whom one might enjoy. But I could see them only in a vague outline for which those houses were to enable me to substitute actual human features. So that if I owed to Bloch — for his ‘good tidings’ that beauty and the enjoyment of beauty were not inaccessible things, and that we have acted foolishly in renouncing them for all time — a debt of gratitude of the same kind that we owe to an optimistic physician or philosopher who has given us reason to hope for length of days in this world and not to be entirely cut off from it when we shall have passed beyond the veil, the houses of assignation which I began to frequent some years later — by furnishing me with specimens of beauty, by allowing me to add to the beauty of women that element which we are powerless to invent, which is something more than a mere summary of former beauties, that present indeed divine, the one present that we cannot bestow upon ourselves, before which faint and fail all the logical creations of our intellect, and which we can seek from reality alone: an individual charm — deserved to be ranked by me with those other benefactors more recent in origin but of comparable utility (before finding which we used to imagine without any warmth the seductive charms of Mantegna, of Wagner, of Siena, by studying other painters, hearing other composers, visiting other cities): namely illustrated editions of the history of painting, symphonic concerts and handbooks to ‘Mediaeval Towns.’ But the house to which Bloch led me (and which he himself, for that matter, had long ceased to visit), was of too humble a grade, its denizens were too inconspicuous and too little varied to be able to satisfy my old or to stimulate new curiosities. The mistress of this house knew none of the women with whom one asked her to negotiate, and was always suggesting others whom one did not want. She boasted to me of one in particular, one of whom, with a smile full of promise (as though this had been a great rarity and a special treat) she would whisper: “She is a Jewess! Doesn’t that make you want to?” (That, by the way, was probably why the girl’s name was Rachel.) And with a silly and affected excitement which, she hoped, would prove contagious, and which ended in a hoarse gurgle, almost of sensual satisfaction: “Think of that, my boy, a Jewess! Wouldn’t that be lovely? Rrrr!” This Rachel, of whom I caught a glimpse without her seeing me, was dark and not good looking, but had an air of intelligence, and would pass the tip of her tongue over her lips as she smiled, with a look of boundless impertinence, at the ‘boys’ who were introduced to her and whom I could hear making conversation. Her small and narrow face was framed in short curls of black hair, irregular as though they were outlined in pen-strokes upon a wash-drawing in Indian ink. Every evening I promised the old woman who offered her to me with a special insistence, boasting of her superior intelligence and her education, that I would not fail to come some day on purpose to make the acquaintance of Rachel, whom I had nicknamed “Rachel when from the Lord.” But the first evening I had heard her, as she was leaving the house, say to the mistress: “That’s settled then; I shall be free to-morrow, if you have anyone you won’t forget to send for me.”

    And these words had prevented me from recognising her as a person because they had made me classify her at once in a general category of women whose habit, common to all of them, was to come there in the evening to see whether there might not be a louis or two to be earned. She would simply vary her formula, saying indifferently: “If you want me” or “If you want anybody.”

    The mistress, who was not familiar with Halévy’s opera, did not know why I always called the girl “Rachel when from the Lord.” But failure to understand a joke has never yet made anyone find it less amusing, and it was always with a whole-hearted laugh that she would say to me:

    “Then there’s nothing doing to-night? When am I going to fix you up with ‘Rachel when from the Lord’? Why do you always say that, ‘Rachel when from the Lord’? Oh, that’s very smart, that is. I’m going to make a match of you two. You won’t be sorry for it, you’ll see.”

    Once I was just making up my mind, but she was ‘in the press,’ another time in the hands of the hairdresser, an elderly gentleman who never did anything for the women except pour oil on their loosened hair and then comb it. And I grew tired of waiting, even though several of the humbler frequenters of the place (working girls, they called themselves, but they always seemed to be out of work), had come to mix drinks for me and to hold long conversations to which, despite the gravity of the subjects discussed, the partial or total nudity of the speakers gave an attractive simplicity. I ceased moreover to go to this house because, anxious to present a token of my good-will to the woman who kept it and was in need of furniture, I had given her several pieces, notably a big sofa, which I had inherited from my aunt Léonie. I used never to see them, for want of space had prevented my parents from taking them in at home, and they were stored in a warehouse. But as soon as I discovered them again in the house where these women were putting them to their own uses, all the virtues that one had imbibed in the air of my aunt’s room at Combray became apparent to me, tortured by the cruel contact to which I had abandoned them in their helplessness! Had I outraged the dead, I should not have suffered such remorse. I returned no more to visit their new mistress, for they seemed to me to be alive, and to be appealing to me, like those objects, apparently inanimate, in a Persian fairy-tale, in which are embodied human souls that are undergoing martyrdom and plead for deliverance. Besides, as our memory presents things to us, as a rule, not in their chronological sequence but as it were by a reflexion in which the order of the parts is reversed, I remembered only long afterwards that it was upon that same sofa that, many years before, I had tasted for the first time the sweets of love with one of my girl cousins, with whom I had not known where to go until she somewhat rashly suggested our taking advantage of a moment in which aunt Léonie had left her room

    A whole lot more of my aunt Léonie’s things, and notably a magnificent set of old silver plate, I sold, in spite of my parents’ warnings, so as to have more money to spend, and to be able to send more flowers to Mme. Swann who would greet me, after receiving an immense basket of orchids, with: “If I were your father, I should have you up before the magistrate for this.” How was I to suppose that one day I might regret more than anything the loss of my silver plate, and rank certain other pleasures more highly than that (which would have shrunk perhaps into none at all) of bestowing favours upon Gilberte’s parents. Similarly, it was with Gilberte in my mind, and so as not to be separated from her, that I had decided not to enter a career of diplomacy abroad. It is always thus, impelled by a state of mind which is destined not to last, that we make our irrevocable decisions. I could scarcely imagine that that strange substance which was housed in Gilberte, and from her permeated her parents and her home, leaving me indifferent to all things else, could be liberated from her, could migrate into another person. The same substance, unquestionable, and yet one that would have a wholly different effect on me. For a single malady goes through various evolutions, and a delicious poison can no longer be taken with the same impunity when, with the passing of the years, the heart’s power of resistance has diminished

    My parents meanwhile would have liked to see the intelligence that Bergotte had discerned in me made manifest in some remarkable achievement. When I still did not know the Swanns I thought that I was prevented from working by the state of agitation into which I was thrown by the impossibility of seeing Gilberte when I chose. But, now that their door stood open to me, scarcely had I sat down at my desk than I would rise and run to them. And after I had left them and was at home again, my isolation was only apparent, my mind was powerless to swim against the stream of words on which I had allowed myself mechanically to be borne for hours on end. Sitting alone, I continued to fashion remarks such as might have pleased or amused the Swanns, and to make this pastime more entertaining I myself took the parts of those absent players, I put to myself imagined questions, so chosen that my brilliant epigrams served merely as happy answers to them. Though conducted in silence, this exercise was none the less a conversation and not a meditation, my solitude a mental society in which it was not I myself but other imaginary speakers who controlled my choice of words, and in which I felt as I formulated, in place of the thoughts that I believed to be true, those that came easily to my mind, and involved no introspection from without, that kind of pleasure, entirely passive, which sitting still affords to anyone who is burdened with a sluggish digestion

    Had I been less firmly resolved upon setting myself definitely to work, I should perhaps have made an effort to begin at once. But since my resolution was explicit, since within twenty-four hours, in the empty frame of that long morrow in which everything was so well arranged because I myself had not yet entered it, my good intentions would be realised without difficulty, it was better not to select an evening on which I was ill-disposed for a beginning for which the following days were not, alas, to shew themselves any more propitious. But I was reasonable. It would have been puerile, on the part of one who had waited now for years, not to put up with a postponement of two or three days. Confident that by the day after next I should have written several pages, I said not a word more to my parents of my decision; I preferred to remain patient for a few hours and then to bring to a convinced and comforted grandmother a sample of work that was already under way. Unfortunately the morrow was not that vast, external day to which I in my fever had looked forward. When it drew to a close, my laziness and my painful struggle to overcome certain internal obstacles had simply lasted twenty-four hours longer. And at the end of several days, my plans not having matured, I had no longer the same hope that they would be realised at once, no longer the courage, therefore, to subordinate everything else to their realisation: I began again to keep late hours, having no longer, to oblige me to go to bed early on any evening, the certain hope of seeing my work begun next morning. I needed, before I could recover my creative energy, several days of relaxation, and the only time that my grandmother ventured, in a gentle and disillusioned tone, to frame the reproach: “Well, and that work of yours; aren’t we even to speak of it now?” I resented her intrusion, convinced that in her inability to see that my mind was irrevocably made up, she had further and perhaps for a long time postponed the execution of my task, by the shock which her denial of justice to me had given my nerves, since until I had recovered from that shock I should not feel inclined to begin my work. She felt that her scepticism had charged blindly into my intention. She apologised, kissing me: “I am sorry; I shall not say anything again,” and, so that I should not be discouraged, assured me that, from the day on which I should be quite well again, the work would come of its own accord from my superfluity of strength

    Besides, I said to myself, in spending all my time with the Swanns, am I not doing exactly what Bergotte does? To my parents it seemed almost as though, idle as I was, I was leading, since it was spent in the same drawing-room with a great writer, the life most favourable to the growth of talent. And yet the assumption that anyone can be dispensed from having to create that talent for himself, from within himself, and can acquire it from some one else, is as impossible as it would be to suppose that a man can keep himself in good health, in spite of neglecting all the rules of hygiene and of indulging in the worst excesses, merely by dining out often in the company of a physician. The person, by the way, who was most completely taken in by this illusion, which misled me as well as my parents, was Mme. Swann. When I explained to her that I was unable to come, that I must stay at home and work, she looked as though she were thinking that I made a great fuss about nothing, that there was something foolish as well as ostentatious in what I had said

    “But Bergotte is coming, isn’t he? Do you mean that you don’t think it good, what he writes? It will be better still, very soon,” she went on, “for he is more pointed, he concentrates more in newspaper articles than in his books, where he is apt to spread out too much. I’ve arranged that in future he’s to do the leading articles in the Figaro. He’ll be distinctly the ‘right man in the right place’ there.” And, finally, “Come! He will tell you, better than anyone, what you ought to do.”

    And so, just as one invites a gentleman ranker to meet his colonel, it was in the interests of my career, and as though masterpieces of literature arose out of ‘getting to know” people, that she told me not to fail to come to dinner with her next day, to meet Bergotte

    And so there was not from the Swanns any more than from my parents, that is to say from those who, at different times, had seemed bound to place obstacles in my way, any further opposition to that pleasant existence in which I might see Gilberte as often as I chose, with enjoyment if not with peace of mind. There can be no peace of mind in love, since the advantage one has secured is never anything but a fresh starting-point for further desires. So long as I had not been free to go to her, having my eyes fixed upon that inaccessible goal of happiness, I could not so much as imagine the fresh grounds for anxiety that lay in wait for me there. Once the resistance of her parents was broken, and the problem solved at last, it began to set itself anew, and always in different terms. Each evening, on arriving home, I reminded myself that I had things to say to Gilberte of prime importance, things upon which our whole friendship hung, and these things were never the same. But at least I was happy, and no further menace arose to threaten my happiness. One was to appear, alas, from a quarter in which I had never detected any peril, namely from Gilberte and myself. And yet I ought to have been tormented by what, on the contrary, reassured me, by what I mistook for happiness. We are, when we love, in an abnormal state, capable of giving at once to an accident, the most simple to all appearance and one that may at any moment occur, a serious-aspect which that accident by itself would not bear. What makes us so happy is the presence in our heart of an unstable element which we are perpetually arranging to keep in position, and of which we cease almost to be aware so long as it is not displaced. Actually, there is in love a permanent strain of suffering which happiness neutralises, makes conditional only, procrastinates, but which may at any moment become what it would long since have been had we not obtained what we were seeking, sheer agony

    On several occasions I felt that Gilberte was anxious to put off my visits. It is true that when I was at all anxious to see her I had only to get myself invited by her parents who were increasingly persuaded of my excellent influence over her. “Thanks to them,” I used to think, “my love is running no risk; the moment I have them on my side, I can set my mind at rest; they have full authority over Gilberte.” Until, alas, I detected certain signs of impatience which she allowed to escape her when her father made me come to the house, almost against her will, and asked myself whether what I had regarded as a protection for my happiness was not in fact the secret reason why that happiness could not endure

    The last time that I called to see Gilberte, it was raining; she had been asked to a dancing lesson in the house of some people whom she knew too slightly to be able to take me there with her. In view of the dampness of the air I had taken rather more caffeine than usual. Perhaps on account of the weather, or because she had some objection to the house in which this party was being given, Mme. Swann, as her daughter was leaving the room, called her back in the sharpest of tones: “Gilberte!” and pointed to me, to indicate that I had come there to see her and that she ought to stay with me. This ‘Gilberte!’ had been uttered, or shouted rather, with the best of intentions towards myself, but from the way in which Gilberte shrugged her shoulders as she took off her outdoor clothes I divined that her mother had unwittingly hastened the gradual evolution, which until then it had perhaps been possible to arrest, which was gradually drawing away from me my friend. “You don’t need to go out dancing every day,” Odette told her daughter, with a sagacity acquired, no doubt, in earlier days, from Swann. Then, becoming once more Odette, she began speaking to her daughter in English. At once it was as though a wall had sprung up to hide from me a part of the life of Gilberte, as though an evil genius had spirited my friend far away. In a language that we know, we have substituted for the opacity of sounds, the perspicuity of ideas. But a language which we do not know is a fortress sealed, within whose walls she whom we love is free to play us false, while we, standing without, desperately alert in our impotence, can see, can prevent nothing. So this conversation in English, at which, a month earlier, I should merely have smiled, interspersed with a few proper names in French which did not fail to accentuate, to give a point to my uneasiness, had, when conducted within a few feet of me by two motionless persons, the same degree of cruelty, left me as much abandoned and alone as the forcible abduction of my companion. At length Mme. Swann left us. That day, perhaps from resentment against myself, the unwilling cause of her not going out to enjoy herself, perhaps also because, guessing her to be angry with me, I was precautionally colder than usual with her, the face of Gilberte, divested of every sign of joy, bleak, bare, pillaged, seemed all afternoon to be devoting a melancholy regret to the pas-de-quatre in which my arrival had prevented her from going to take part, and to be defying every living creature, beginning with myself, to understand the subtle reasons that had determined in her a sentimental attachment to the boston. She confined herself to exchanging with me, now and again, on the weather, the increasing violence of the rain, the fastness of the clock, a conversation punctuated with silences and monosyllables, in which I lashed myself on, with a sort of desperate rage, to the destruction of those moments which we might have devoted to friendship and happiness. And on each of our remarks was stamped, as it were, a supreme harshness, by the paroxysm of their stupefying unimportance, which at the same time consoled me, for it prevented Gilberte from being taken in by the banality of my observations and the indifference of my tone. In vain was my polite: “I thought, the other day, that the clock was slow, if anything”; she evidently understood me to mean: “How tiresome you are being!” Obstinately as I might protract, over the whole length of that rain-sodden afternoon, the dull cloud of words through which no fitful ray shone, I knew that my coldness was not so unalterably fixed as I pretended, and that Gilberte must be fully aware that if, after already saying it to her three times, I had hazarded a fourth repetition of the statement that the evenings were drawing in, I should have had difficulty in restraining myself from bursting into tears. When she was like that, when no smile filled her eyes or unveiled her face, I cannot describe the devastating monotony that stamped her melancholy eyes and sullen features. Her face, grown almost livid, reminded me then of those dreary beaches where the sea, ebbing far out, wearies one with its faint shimmering, everywhere the same, fixed in an immutable and low horizon. At length, as I saw no sign in Gilberte of the happy change for which I had been waiting now for some hours, I told her that she was not being nice. “It is you that are not being nice,” was her answer. “Oh, but surely ——!” I asked myself what I could have done, and, finding no answer, put the question to her. “Naturally, you think yourself nice!” she said to me with a laugh, and went on laughing. Whereupon I felt all the anguish that there was for me in not being able to attain to that other, less perceptible, plane of her mind which her laughter indicated. It seemed, that laughter, to mean: “No, no, I’m not going to let myself be moved by anything that you say, I know you’re madly in love with me, but that leaves me neither hot nor cold, for I don’t care a rap for you.” But I told myself that, after all, laughter was not a language so well defined that I could be certain of understanding what this laugh really meant. And Gilberte’s words were affectionate. “But how am I not being nice?” I asked her. “Tell me; I will do anything you want.” “No; that wouldn’t be any good. I can’t explain.” For a moment I was afraid that she thought that I did not love her, and this was for me a fresh agony, no less keen, but one that required treatment by a different conversational method. “If you knew how much you were hurting me you would tell me.” But this pain which, had she doubted my love for her, must have rejoiced her, seemed instead to make her more angry. Then, realising my mistake, making up my mind to pay no more attention to what she said, letting her (without bothering to believe her) assure me: “I do love you, indeed I do; you will see one day,” (that day on which the guilty are convinced that their innocence will be made clear, and which, for some mysterious reason, never happens to be the day on which their evidence is taken), I had the courage to make a sudden resolution not to see her again, and without telling her of it yet since she would not have believed me

    Grief that is caused one by a person with whom one is in love can be bitter, even when it is interpolated among preoccupations, occupations, pleasures in which that person is not directly involved and from which our attention is diverted only now and again to return to it. But when such a grief has its birth — as was now happening — at a moment when the happiness of seeing that person fills us to the exclusion of all else, the sharp depression that then affects our spirits, sunny hitherto, sustained and calm, lets loose in us a raging tempest against which we know not whether we are capable of struggling to the end. The tempest that was blowing in my heart was so violent that I made my way home baffled, battered, feeling that I could recover my breath only by retracing my steps, by returning, upon whatever pretext, into Gilberte’s presence. But she would have said to herself: “Back again! Evidently I can go to any length with him; he will come back every time, and the more wretched he is when he leaves me the more docile he’ll be.” Besides, I was irresistibly drawn towards her in thought, and those alternative orientations, that mad careering between them of the compass-needle within me, persisted after I had reached home, and expressed themselves in the mutually contradictory letters to Gilberte which I began to draft

    I was about to pass through one of those difficult crises which we generally find that we have to face at various stages in life, and which, for all that there has been no change in our character, in our nature (that nature which itself creates our loves, and almost creates the women whom we love, even to their faults), we do not face in the same way on each occasion, that is to say at every age. At such moments our life is divided, and so to speak distributed over a pair of scales, in two counterpoised pans which between them contain it all. In one there is our desire not to displease, not to appear too humble to the creature whom we love without managing to understand her, but whom we find it more convenient at times to appear almost to disregard, so that she shall not have that sense of her own indis-pensability which may turn her from us; in the other scale there is a feeling of pain — and one that is not localised and partial only — which cannot be set at rest unless, abandoning every thought of pleasing the woman and of making her believe that we can dispense with her, we go at once to find her. When we withdraw from the pan in which our pride lies a small quantity of the will-power which we have weakly allowed to exhaust itself with increasing age, when we add to the pan that holds our suffering a physical pain which we have acquired and have let grow, then, instead of the courageous solution that would have carried the day at one-and-twenty, it is the other, grown too heavy and insufficiently balanced, that crushes us down at fifty. All the more because situations, while repeating them-.selves, tend to alter, and there is every likelihood that, in middle life or in old age, we shall have had the grim satisfaction of complicating our love by an intrusion of habit which adolescence, repressed by other demands upon it, less master of itself, has never known

    I had just written Gilberte a letter in which I allowed the tempest of my wrath to thunder, not however without throwing her the lifebuoy of a few words disposed as though by accident on the page, by clinging to which my friend might be brought to a reconciliation; a moment later, the wind having changed, they were phrases full of love that I addressed to her, chosen for the sweetness of certain forlorn expressions, those ‘nevermores’ so touching to those who pen them, so wearisome to her who will have to read them, whether she believe them to be false and translate ‘nevermore’ by ‘this very evening, if you want me,’ or believe them to be true and so to be breaking the news to her of one of those final separations which make so little difference to our lives when the other person is one with whom we are not in love. But since we are incapable, while we are in love, of acting as fit predecessors of the next persons whom we shall presently have become, and who will then be in love no longer, how are we to imagine the actual state of mind of a woman whom, even when we are conscious that we are of no account to her, we have perpetually represented in our musings as uttering, so as to lull us into a happy dream or to console us for a great sorrow, the same speeches that she would make if she loved us. When we come to examine the thoughts, the actions of a woman whom we love, we are as completely at a loss as must have been, face to face with the phenomena of nature, the world’s first natural philosophers, before their science had been elaborated and had cast a ray of light over the unknown. Or, worse still, we are like a person in whose mind the law of causality barely exists, a person who would be incapable, therefore, of establishing any connexion between one phenomenon and another, to whose eyes the spectacle of the world would appear unstable as a dream. Of course I made efforts to emerge from this incoherence, to find reasons for things. I tried even to be ‘objective’ and, to that end, to bear well in mind the disproportion that existed between the importance which Gilberte had in my eyes and that, not only which I had in hers, but which she herself had in the eyes of other people, a disproportion which, had I failed to remark it, would have involved my mistaking mere friendliness on my friend’s part for a passionate avowal, and a grotesque and debasing display on my own for the simple and graceful movement with which we are attracted towards a pretty face. But I was afraid also of falling into the contrary error, in which I should have seen in Gilberte’s unpunctuality in keeping an appointment an irremediable hostility. I tried to discover between these two perspectives, equally distorting, a third which would enable me to see things as they really were; the calculations I was obliged to make with that object helped to take my mind off my sufferings; and whether in obedience to the laws of arithmetic or because I had made them give me the answer that I desired, I made up my mind that next day I would go to the Swanns’, happy, but happy in the same way as people who, having long been tormented by the thought of a journey which they have not wished to make, go no farther than to the station and return home to unpack their boxes. And since, while one is hesitating, the bare idea of a possible resolution (unless one has rendered that idea sterile by deciding that one will make no resolution) develops, like a seed in the ground, the lineaments, every detail of the emotions that will be born from the performance of the action, I told myself that it had been quite absurd of me to be as much hurt by the suggestion that I should not see Gilberte again as if I had really been about to put that suggestion into practice, and that since, on the contrary, I was to end by returning to her side, I might have saved myself the expense of all those vain longings and painful acceptances. But this resumption of friendly relations lasted only so long as it took me to reach the Swanns’; not because their butler, who was really fond of me, told me that Gilberte had gone out (a statement the truth of which was confirmed, as it happened, the same evening, by people who had seen her somewhere), but because of the manner in which he said it. “Sir, the young lady is not at home; I can assure you, sir, that I am speaking the truth. If you wish to make any inquiries I can fetch the young lady’s maid. You know very well, sir, that I would do everything in my power to oblige you, and that if the young lady was at home I would take you to her at once.” These words being of the only kind that is really important, that is to say spontaneous, the kind that gives us a radiograph shewing the main points, at any rate, of the unimaginable reality which would be wholly concealed beneath a prepared speech, proved that in Gilberte’s household there was an impression that I bothered her with my visits; and so, scarcely had the man uttered them before they had aroused in me a hatred of which I preferred to make him rather than Gilberte the victim; he drew upon his own head all the angry feelings that I might have had for my friend; freed from these complications, thanks to his words, my love subsisted alone; but his words had, at the same time, shewn me that I must cease for the present to attempt to see Gilberte. She would be certain to write to me, to apologise. In spite of which, I should not return at once to see her, so as to prove to her that I was capable of living without her. Besides, once I had received her letter, Gilberte’s society was a thing with which I should be more easily able to dispense for a time, since I should be certain of finding her ready to receive me whenever I chose. All that I needed in order to support with less pain the burden of a voluntary separation was to feel that my heart was rid of the terrible uncertainty whether we were not irreconcilably sundered, whether she had not promised herself to another, left Paris, been taken away by force. The days that followed resembled the first week of that old New Year which I had had to spend alone, without Gilberte. But when that week had dragged to its end, then for one thing my friend would be coming again to the Champs-Elysées, I should be seeing her as before; I had been sure of that; for another thing, I had known with no less certainty that so long as the New Year holidays lasted it would not be worth my while to go to the Champs-Elysées, which meant that during that miserable week, which was already ancient history, I had endured my wretchedness with a quiet mind because there was blended in it neither fear nor hope. Now, on the other hand, it was the latter of these which, almost as much as my fear of what might happen, rendered intolerable the burden of my grief. Not having had any letter from Gilberte that evening, I had attributed this to her carelessness, to her other occupations, I did not doubt that I should find something from her in the morning’s post. This I awaited, every day, with a beating heart which subsided, leaving me utterly prostrate, when I had found in it only letters from people who were not Gilberte, or else nothing at all, which was no worse, the proofs of another’s friendship making all the more cruel those of her indifference. I transferred my hopes to the afternoon post. Even between the times at which letters were delivered I dared not leave the house, for she might be sending hers by a messenger. Then, the time coming at last when neither the postman nor a footman from the Swanns’ could possibly appear that night, I must procrastinate my hope of being set at rest, and thus, because I believed that my sufferings were not destined to last, I was obliged, so to speak, incessantly to renew them. My disappointment was perhaps the same, but instead of just uniformly prolonging, as in the old days, an initial emotion, it began again several times daily, starting each time with an emotion so frequently renewed that it ended — it, so purely physical, so instantaneous a state — by becoming stabilised, so consistently that the strain of waiting having hardly time to relax before a fresh reason for waiting supervened, there was no longer a single minute in the day in which I was not in that state of anxiety which it is so difficult to bear even for an hour. So my punishment was infinitely more cruel than in those New Year holidays long ago, because this time there was in me, instead of the acceptance, pure and simple, of that punishment, the hope, at every moment, of seeing it come to an end. And yet at this state of acceptance I ultimately arrived; then I understood that it must be final, and I renounced Gilberte for ever, in the interests of my love itself and because I hoped above all that she would not retain any contemptuous memory of me. Indeed, from that moment, so that she should not be led to suppose any sort of lover’s spite on my part, when she made appointments for me to see her I used often to accept them and then, at the last moment, write to her that I was prevented from coming, but with the same protestations of my disappointment that I should have made to anyone whom I had not wished to see. These expressions of regret, which we keep as a rule for people who do not matter, would do more, I imagined, to persuade Gilberte of my indifference than would the tone of indifference which we affect only to those whom we love. When, better than by mere words, by a course of action indefinitely repeated, I should have proved to her that I had no appetite for seeing her, perhaps she would discover once again an appetite for seeing me. Alas! I was doomed to failure; to attempt, by ceasing to see her, to reawaken in her that inclination to see me was to lose her for ever; first of all, because, when it began to revive, if I wished it to last I must not give way to it at once; besides, the most agonising hours would then have passed; it was at this very moment that she was indispensable to me, and I should have liked to be able to warn her that what presently she would have to assuage, by the act of seeing me again, would be a grief so far diminished as to be no longer (what a moment ago it would still have been), nor the thought of putting an end to it, a motive towards surrender, reconciliation, further meetings. And then again, later on, when I should at last be able safely to confess to Gilberte (so far would her liking for me have regained its strength) my liking for her, the latter, not having been able to resist the strain of so long a separation, would have ceased to exist; Gilberte would have become immaterial to me. I knew this, but I could not explain it to her; she would have assumed that if I was pretending that I should cease to love her if I remained for too long without seeing her, that was solely in order that she might summon me back to her at once. In the meantime, what made it easier for me to sentence myself to this separation was the fact that (in order to make it quite clear to her that despite my protestations to the contrary it was my own free will and not any conflicting engagement, not the state of my health that prevented me from seeing her), whenever I knew beforehand that Gilberte would not be in the house, was going out somewhere with a friend and would not be home for dinner, I went to see Mme. Swann who had once more become to me what she had been at the time when I had such difficulty in seeing her daughter and (on days when the latter was not coming to the Champs-Elysées) used to repair to the Allée des Acacias. In this way I should be hearing about Gilberte, and could be certain that she would in due course hear about me, and in terms which would shew her that I was not interested in her. And I found, as all those who suffer find, that my melancholy condition might have been worse. For being free at any time to enter the habitation in which Gilberte dwelt, I constantly reminded myself, for all that I was firmly resolved to make no use of that privilege, that if ever my pain grew too sharp there was a way of making it cease. I was not unhappy, save only from day to day. And even that is an exaggeration. How many times in an hour (but now without that anxious expectancy which had strained every nerve of me in the first weeks after our quarrel, before I had gone again to the Swanns’) did I not repeat to myself the words of the letter which, one day soon, Gilberte would surely send, would perhaps even bring to me herself. The perpetual vision of that imagined happiness helped me to endure the desolation of my real happiness. With women who do not love Us, as with the ‘missing,’ the knowledge that there is no hope left does not prevent our continuing to wait for news. We live on tenterhooks, starting at the slightest sound; the mother whose son has gone to sea on some perilous voyage of discovery sees him in imagination every moment, long after the fact of his having perished has been established, striding into the room, saved by a miracle and in the best of health. And this strain of waiting, according to the strength of her memory and the resistance of her bodily organs, either helps her on her journey through the years, at the end of which she will be able to endure the knowledge that her son is no more, to forget gradually and to survive his loss, or else it kills her

    On the other hand, my grief found consolation in the idea that my love must profit by it. Each visit that I paid to Mme. Swann without seeing Gilberte was a cruel punishment, but I felt that it correspondingly enhanced the idea that Gilberte had of me

    Besides, if I always took care, before going to see Mme. Swann, that there should be no risk of her daughter’s appearing, that arose, it is true, from my determination to break with her, but no less perhaps from that hope of reconciliation which overlay my intention to renounce her (very few of such intentions are absolute, at least in a continuous form, in this human soul of ours, one of whose laws, confirmed by the unlooked-for wealth of illustration that memory supplies, is intermittence), and hid from me all that in it was unbearably cruel. As for that hope, I saw clearly how far it was chimerical. I was like a pauper who moistens his dry crust with fewer tears if he assures himself that, at any moment, a total stranger is perhaps going to leave him the whole of his fortune. We are all of us obliged, if we are to make reality endurable, to nurse a few little follies in ourselves. Now my hope remained more intact — while at the same time our separation became more effectual — if I refrained from meeting Gilberte. If I had found myself face to face with her in her mother’s drawing-room, we might perhaps have uttered irrevocable words which would have rendered our breach final, killed my hope and, on the other hand, by creating a fresh anxiety, reawakened my love and made resignation harder

    Ever so long ago, before I had even thought of breaking with her daughter, Mme. Swann had said to me: “It is all very well your coming to see Gilberte; I should like you to come sometimes for my sake, not to my ‘kettledrums,’ which would bore you because there is such a crowd, but on the other days, when you will always find me at home if you come fairly late.” So that I might be thought, when I came to see her, to be yielding only after a long resistance to a desire which she had expressed in the past. And very late in the afternoon, when it was quite dark, almost at the hour at which my parents would be sitting down to dinner, I would set out to pay Mme. Swann a visit, in the course of which I knew that I should not see Gilberte, and yet should be thinking only of her. In that quarter, then looked upon as remote, of a Paris darker than Paris is to-day, where even in the centre there was no electric light in the public thoroughfares and very little in private houses, the lamps of a drawing-room situated on the ground level, or but slightly raised above it, as were the rooms in which Mme. Swann generally received her visitors, were enough to lighten the street, and to make the passer-by raise his eyes, connecting with their glow, as with its apparent though hidden cause, the presence outside the door of a string of smart broughams. This passer-by was led to believe, not without a certain emotion, that a modification had been effected in this mysterious cause, when he saw one of the carriages begin to move; but it was merely a coachman who, afraid of his horses’ catching cold, started them now and again on a brisk walk, all the more impressive because the rubber-tired wheels gave the sound of their hooves a background of silence from which it stood out more distinct and more explicit

    The ‘winter-garden,’ of which in those days the passer-by generally caught a glimpse, in whatever street he might be walking, if the drawing-room did not stand too high above the pavement, is to be seen to-day only in photogravures in the gift-books of P. J. Stahl, where, in contrast to the infrequent floral decorations of the Louis XVI drawing-rooms now in fashion — a single rose or a Japanese iris in a long-necked vase of crystal into which it would be impossible to squeeze a second — it seems, because of the profusion of indoor plants which people had then, and of the absolute want of style in their arrangement, as though it must have responded in the ladies whose houses it adorned to some living and delicious passion for botany rather than to any cold concern for lifeless decoration. It suggested to one, only on a larger scale, in the houses of those days, those tiny, portable hothouses laid out on New Year’s morning beneath the lighted lamp — for the children were always too impatient to wait for daylight — among all the other New Year’s presents but the loveliest of them all, consoling them with its real plants which they could tend as they grew for the bareness of the winter soil; and even more than those little houses themselves, those winter-gardens were like the hothouse that the children could see there at the same time, portrayed in a delightful book, another of their presents, and one which, for all that it was given not to them but to Mlle. Lili, the heroine of the story, enchanted them to such a pitch that even now, when they are almost old men and women, they ask themselves whether, in those fortunate years, winter was not the loveliest of the seasons. And inside there, beyond the winter-garden, through the various kinds of arborescence which from the street made the lighted window appear like the glass front of one of those children’s playthings, pictured or real, the passer-by, drawing himself up on tiptoe, would generally observe a man in a frock coat, a gardenia or a carnation in his buttonhole, standing before a seated lady, both vaguely outlined, like two intaglios cut in a topaz, in the depths of the drawing-room atmosphere clouted by the samovar — then a recent importation — with steam which may very possibly be escaping from it still to-day, but to which, if it does, we are grown so accustomed now that no one notices it. Mme. Swann attached great importance to her ‘tea’; she thought that she shewed her originality and expressed her charm when she said to a man, “You will find me at home any day, fairly late; come to tea!” so that she allowed a sweet and delicate smile to accompany the words which she pronounced with a fleeting trace of English accent, and which her listener duly noted, bowing solemnly in acceptance, as though the invitation had been something important and uncommon which commanded deference and required attention. There was another reason, apart from those given already, for the flowers’ having more than a merely ornamental part in Mme. Swann’s drawing-room, and this reason pertained not to the period, but, in some degree, to the former life of Odette. A great courtesan, such as she had been, lives largely for her lovers, that is to say at home, which means that she comes in time to live for her home. The things that one sees in the house of a ‘respectable’ woman, things which may of course appear to her also to be of importance, are those which are in any event of the utmost importance to the courtesan. The culminating point of her day is not the moment in which she dresses herself for all the world to see, but that in which she undresses herself for a man. She must be as smart in her wrapper, in her nightgown, as in her outdoor attire. Other women display their jewels, but as for her, she lives in the intimacy of her pearls. This kind of existence imposes on her as an obligation and ends by giving her a fondness for luxury which is secret, that is to say which comes near to being disinterested. Mme. Swann extended this to include her flowers. There was always beside her chair an immense bowl of crystal filled to the brim with Parma violets or with long white daisy-petals scattered upon the water, which seemed to be testifying, in the eyes of the arriving guest, to some favourite and interrupted occupation, such as the cup of tea which Mme. Swann would, for her own amusement, have been drinking there by herself; an occupation more intimate still and more mysterious, so much so that one felt oneself impelled to apologise on seeing the flowers exposed there by her side, as one would have apologised for looking at the title of the still open book which would have revealed to one what had just been read by — and so, perhaps, what was still in the mind of Odette. And unlike the book the flowers were living things; it was annoying, when one entered the room to pay Mme. Swann a visit, to discover that she was not alone, or if one came home with her not to find the room empty, so prominent a place in it, enigmatic and intimately associated with hours in the life of their mistress of which one knew nothing, did those flowers assume which had not been made ready for Odette’s visitors but, as it were, forgotten there by her, had held and would hold with her again private conversations which one was afraid of disturbing, the secret of which one tried in vain to read, fastening one’s eyes on the moist purple, the still liquid water-colour of the Parma violets. By the end of October Odette would begin to come home with the utmost punctuality for tea, which was still known, at that time, as ‘five-o’clock tea,’ having once heard it said, and being fond of repeating that if Mme. Verdurin had been able to form a salon it was because people were always certain of finding her at home at the same hour. She imagined that she herself had one also, of the same kind, but freer, senza rigore as she used to say. She saw herself figuring thus as a sort of Lespinasse, and believed that she had founded a rival salon by taking from the du Defiant of the little group several of her most attractive men, notably Swann himself, who had followed her in her secession and into her retirement, according-to a version for which one can understand that she had succeeded in gaining credit among her more recent friends, ignorant of what had passed, though without convincing herself. But certain favourite parts are played by us so often before the public and rehearsed so carefully when we are alone that we find it easier to refer to their fictitious testimony than to that of a reality which we have almost entirely forgotten. On days on which Mme. Swann had not left the house, one found her in a wrapper of crêpe-de-Chine, white as the first snows of winter, or, it might be, in one of those long pleated garments of moussettne-de-soie, which seemed nothing more than a shower of white or rosy petals, and would be regarded to-day as hardly suitable for winter, though quite wrongly. For these light fabrics and soft colours gave to a woman — in the stifling warmth of the drawing-rooms of those days, with their heavily curtained doors, rooms of which the most effective thing that the society novelists of the time could find to say was that they were ‘exquisitely cushioned’— the same air of coolness that they gave to the roses which were able to stay in the room there by her side, despite the winter, in the glowing flesh tints of their nudity, as though it were already spring. By reason of the muffling of all sound in the carpets, and of the remoteness of her cosy retreat, the lady of the house, not being apprised of your entry as she is to-day, would continue to read almost until you were standing before her chair, which enhanced still further that sense of the romantic, that charm of a sort of secret discovery, which we find to-day in the memory of those gowns, already out of fashion even then, which Mme. Swann was perhaps alone in not having discarded, and which give us the feeling that the woman who wore them must have been the heroine of a novel because most of us have scarcely set eyes on them outside the pages of certain of Henry Gréville’s tales. Odette had, at this time, in her drawing-room, when winter began, chrysanthemums of enormous size and a variety of colours such as Swann, in the old days, certainly never saw in her drawing-room in the Rue La Pérouse. My admiration for them — when I went to pay Mme. Swann one of those melancholy visits during which, prompted by my sorrow, I discovered in her all the mystical poetry of her character as the mother of that Gilberte to whom she would say on the morrow: “Your friend came to see me yesterday,”— sprang, no doubt, from my sense that, rose-pale like the Louis XIV silk that covered her chairs, snow-white like her crêpe-de-Chine wrapper, or of a metallic red like her samovar, they superimposed upon the decoration of the room another, a supplementary scheme of decoration, as rich, as delicate in its colouring, but one which was alive and would last for a few days only. But I was touched to find that these chrysanthemums appeared less ephemeral than, one might almost say, lasting, when I compared them with the tones, as pink, as coppery, which the setting sun so gorgeously displays amid the mists of a November afternoon, and which, after seeing them, before I had entered the house, fade from the sky, I found again inside, prolonged, transposed on to the flaming palette of the flowers. Like the fires caught and fixed by a great colourist from the impermanence of the atmosphere and the sun, so that they should enter and adorn a human dwelling, they invited me, those chrysanthemums, to put away all my sorrows and to taste with a greedy rapture during that ‘tea-time’ the too fleeting joys of November, of which they set ablaze all around me the intimate and mystical glory. Alas, it was not in the conversations to which I must listen that I could hope to attain to that glory; they had but little in common with it. Even with Mme. Cottard, and although it was growing late, Mme. Swann would assume her most caressing manner to say: “Oh, no, it’s not late, really; you mustn’t look at the clock; that’s not the right time; it’s stopped; you can’t possibly have anything else to do now, why be in such a hurry?” as she pressed a final tartlet upon the Professor’s wife, who was gripping her card-case in readiness for flight

    “One simply can’t tear oneself away from this house!” observed Mme. Bontemps to Mme. Swann, while Mme. Cottard, in her astonishment at hearing her own thought put into words, exclaimed: “Why, that’s just what I always say myself, what I tell my own little judge, in the court of conscience!” winning the applause of the gentlemen from the Jockey Club, who had been profuse in their salutations, as though confounded at such an honour’s being done them, when Mme. Swann had introduced them to this common and by no means attractive little woman, who kept herself, when confronted with Odette’s brilliant friends, in reserve, if not on what she herself called ‘the defensive,’ for she always used stately language to describe the simplest happenings. “I should never have suspected it,” was Mme. Swann’s comment, “three Wednesdays running you’ve played me false.” “That’s quite true, Odette; it’s simply ages, it’s an eternity since I saw you last. You see, I plead guilty; but I must tell you,” she went on with a vague suggestion of outraged modesty, for although a doctor’s wife she would never have dared to speak without periphrasis of rheumatism or of a chill on the kidneys,” that I have had a lot of little troubles. As we all have, I dare say. And besides that I’ve had a crisis among my masculine domestics. I’m sure, I’m no more imbued with a sense of my own authority than most ladies; still I’ve been obliged, just to make an example you know, to give my Vatel notice; I believe he was looking out anyhow for a more remunerative place. But his departure nearly brought about the resignation of my entire ministry. My own maid refused to stay in the house a moment longer; oh, we have had some Homeric scenes. However I held fast to the reins through thick and thin; the whole affair’s been a perfect lesson, which won’t be lost on me, I can tell you. I’m afraid I’m boring you with all these stories about servants, but you know as well as I do what a business it is when one is obliged to set about rearranging one’s household

    “Aren’t we to see anything of your delicious child?” she wound up. “No, my delicious child is dining with a friend,” replied Mme. Swann, and then, turning to me: “I believe she’s written to you, asking you to come and see her to-morrow. And your babies?” she went on to Mme. Cottard. I breathed a sigh of relief. These words by which Mme. Swann proved to me that I oould see Gilberte whenever I chose gave me precisely the comfort which I had come to seek, and which at that time made my visits to Mme. Swann so necessary. “No, I’m afraid not; I shall write to her, anyhow, this evening. Gilberte and I never seem to see one another now,” I added, pretending to attribute our separation to some mysterious agency, which gave me a further illusion of being in love, supported as well by the affectionate way in which I spoke of Gilberte and she of me. “You know, she’s simply devoted to you,” said Mme. Swann. “Really, you won’t come to-morrow?” Suddenly my heart rose on wings; the thought had just struck me —“After all, why shouldn’t I, since it’s her own mother who suggests it?” But with the thought I fell back into my old depression. I was afraid now lest, when she saw me again, Gilberte might think that my indifference of late had been feigned, and it seemed wiser to prolong our separation. During these asides Mme. Bontemps had been complaining of the insufferable dulness of politicians’ wives, for she pretended to find everyone too deadly or too stupid for words, and to deplore her husband’s official position. “Do you mean to say you can shake hands with fifty doctors’ wives, like that, one after the other?” she exclaimed to Mme. Cottard, who, unlike her, was full of the kindest feelings for everybody and of determination to do her duty in every respect. “Ah! you’re a law-abiding woman! You see, in my case’, at the Ministry, don’t you know, I simply have to keep it up, of course. It’s too much for me, I can tell you; you know what those officials’ wives are like, it’s all I can do not to put my tongue out at them. And my niece Albertine is just like me. You really wouldn’t believe the impudence that girl has. Last week, on my ‘day,’ I had the wife of the Under Secretary of State for Finance, who told us that she knew nothing at all about cooking. ‘But surely, ma’am,’ my niece chipped in with her most winning smile, ‘you ought to know everything about it, after all the dishes your father had to wash.’” “Oh, I do love that story; I think it’s simply exquisite!” cried Mme. Swann. “But certainly on the Doctor’s consultation days you should make a point of being ‘at home,’ among your flowers and books and all your pretty things,” she urged Mme. Cottard. “Straight out like that! Bang! Right in the face; bang! She made no bones about it, I can tell you! And she’d never said a word to me about it, the little wretch; she’s as cunning as a monkey. You are lucky to be able to control yourself; I do envy people who can hide what is in their minds.” “But I’ve no need to do that, Mme. Bontemps, I’m not so hard to please,” Mme. Cottard gently expostulated. “For one thing, I’m not in such a privileged position,” she went on, slightly raising her voice as was her custom, as though she were underlining the point of her remark, whenever she slipped into the conversation any of those delicate courtesies, those skilful flatteries which won her the admiration and assisted the career of her husband. “And besides I’m only too glad to do anything that can be of use to the Professor.”

    “But, my dear, it isn’t what one’s glad to do; it’s what one is able to do! I expect you’re not nervous. Do you know, whenever I see the War Minister’s wife making faces, I start copying her at once. It’s a dreadful thing to have a temperament like mine.”

    “To be sure, yes,” said Mme. Cottard, “I’ve heard people say that she had a twitch; my husband knows someone else who occupies a very high position, and it’s only natural, when gentlemen get talking together . . . ”

    “And then, don’t you know, it’s just the same with the Chief of the Registry; he’s a hunchback. Whenever he comes to see me, before he’s been in the room five minutes my fingers are itching to stroke his hump. My husband says I’ll cost him his place. What if I do! A fig for the Ministry! Yes, a fig for the Ministry! I should like to have that printed as a motto on my notepaper. I can see I am shocking you; you’re so frightfully proper, but I must say there’s nothing amuses me like a little devilry now and then. Life would be dreadfully monotonous without it.” And she went on talking about the Ministry all the time, as though it had been Mount Olympus. To change the conversation, Mme. Swann turned to Mme. Cottard: “But you’re looking very smart to-day. Redfern fecit?”

    “No, you know, I always swear by Rauthnitz. Besides, it’s only an old thing I’ve had done up.” “Not really! It’s charming!”

    “Guess how much. . . . No, change the first figure!”

    “You don’t say so! Why, that’s nothing; it’s given away! Three times that at least, I should have said.” “You see how history comes to be written,” apostrophised the doctor’s wife. And pointing to a neck-ribbon which had been a present from Mme. Swann: “Look, Odette! Do you recognise this?”

    Through the gap between a pair of curtains a head peeped with ceremonious deference, making a playful pretence of being afraid of disturbing the party; it was Swann. “Odette, the Prince d’Agrigente is with me in the study. He wants to know if he may pay his respects to you. What am I to tell him?” “Why, that I shall be delighted,” Odette would reply, secretly flattered, but without losing anything of the composure which came to her all the more easily since she had always, even in her ‘fast’ days, been accustomed to entertain men of fashion. Swann disappeared to deliver the message, and would presently return with the Prince, unless in the meantime Mme. Verdurin had arrived. When he married Odette Swann had insisted on her ceasing to frequent the little clan. (He had several good reasons for this stipulation, though, had he had none, he would have made it just the same in obedience to a law of ingratitude which admits no exception, and proves that every ‘go-between’ is either lacking in foresight or else singularly disinterested.) He had conceded only that Odette and Mme. Verdurin might exchange visits once a year, and even this seemed excessive to some of the ‘faithful,’ indignant at the insult offered to the ‘Mistress’ who for so many years had treated Odette and even Swann himself as the spoiled children of her house. For if it contained false brethren who ‘failed’ upon certain evenings in order that they might secretly accept an invitation from Odette, ready, in the event of discovery, with the excuse that they were anxious to meet Bergotte (although the Mistress assured them that he never went to the Swanns’, and even if he did, had no vestige of talent, really — in spite of which she was making the most strenuous efforts, to quote one of her favourite expressions, to ‘attract’ him), the little group had its ‘die-hards’ also. And these, though ignorant of those conventional refinements which often dissuade people from the extreme attitude one would have liked to see them adopt in order to annoy some one else, would have wished Mme. Verdurin, but had never managed to prevail upon her, to sever all connection with Odette, and thus deprive Odette of the satisfaction of saying, with a mocking laugh: “We go to the Mistress’s very seldom now, since the Schism. It was all very well while my husband was still a bachelor, but when one is married, you know, it isn’t always so easy. . . . If you must know, M. Swann can’t abide old Ma Verdurin, and he wouldn’t much like the idea of my going there regularly, as I used to. And I, as a dutiful spouse, don’t you see . . .?” Swann would accompany his wife to their annual evening there but would take care not to be in the room when Mme. Verdurin came to call. And so, if the ‘Mistress’ was in the drawing-room, the Prince d’Agrigente would enter it alone. Alone, too, he was presented to her by Odette, who preferred that Mme. Verdurin should be left in ignorance of the names of her humbler guests, and so might, seeing more than one strange face in the room, be led to believe that she was mixing with the cream of the aristocracy, a device which proved so far successful that Mme. Verdurin said to her husband, that evening, with profound contempt: “Charming people, her friends! I met all the fine flower of the Reaction!” Odette was living, with respect to Mme. Verdurin, under a converse illusion. Not that the latter’s salon had ever begun, at that time, to develop into what we shail one day see it to have become. Mme. Verdurin had not yet reached the period of incubation in which one dispenses with one’s big parties, where the few brilliant specimens recently acquired would be lost in too numerous a crowd, and prefers to wait until the generative force of the ten righteous whom one has succeeded in attracting shall have multiplied those ten seventyfold. As Odette was not to be long now in doing, Mme. Verdurin did indeed entertain the idea of ‘Society’ as her final objective, but her zone of attack was as yet so restricted, and moreover so remote from that in which Odette had some chance of arriving at an identical goal, of breaking the line of defence, that the latter remained absolutely ignorant of the strategic plans which the ‘Mistress’ was elaborating. And it was with the most perfect sincerity that Odette, when anyone spoke to her of Mme. Verdurin as a snob, would answer, laughing, “Oh, no, quite the opposite! For one thing, she never gets a chance of being a snob; she doesn’t know anyone. And then, to do her justice, I must say that she seems quite pleased not to know anyone. No, what she likes are her Wednesdays, and people who talk well.” And in her heart of hearts she envied Mme. Verdurin (for all that she did not despair of having herself, in so eminent a school, succeeded in acquiring them) those arts to which the ‘Mistress’ attached such paramount importance, albeit they did but discriminate, between shades of the Non-existent, sculpture the void, and were, properly speaking, the Arts of Nonentity: to wit those, in the lady of a house, of knowing how to ‘bring people together,’ how to ‘group,’ to ‘draw out,’ to ‘keep in the background,’ to act as a ‘connecting link.’

    In any case, Mme. Swann’s friends were impressed when they saw in her house a lady of whom they were accustomed to think only as in her own, in an inseparable setting of her guests, amid the whole of her little group which they were astonished to behold thus suggested, summarised, assembled, packed into a single armchair in the bodily form of the ‘Mistress,’ the hostess turned visitor, muffled in her cloak with its grebe trimming, as shaggy as the white skins that carpeted that drawing-room embowered in which Mme. Verdurin was a drawing-room in herself. The more timid among the women thought it prudent to retire, and using the plural, as people do when they mean to hint to the rest of the room that it is wiser not to tire a convalescent who is out of bed for the first time: “Odette,” they murmured, “we are going to leave you.” They envied Mme. Cottard, whom the ‘Mistress’ called by her Christian name. “Can I drop you anywhere?” Mme. Verdurin asked her, unable to bear the thought that one of the faithful was going to remain behind instead of following her from the room. “Oh, but this lady has been so very kind as to say, she’ll take me,” replied Mme. Cottard, not wishing to appear to be forgetting, when approached by a more illustrious personage, that she had accepted the offer which Mme. Bontémps had made of driving her home behind her cockaded coachman. “I must say that I am always specially grateful to the friends who are so kind as to take me with them in their vehicles. It is a regular godsend to me, who have no Automedon.” “Especially,” broke in the ‘Mistress,’ who felt that she must say something, since she knew Mme. Bontémps slightly and had just invited her to her Wednesdays, “as at Mme. de Crécy’s house you’re not very near home. Oh, good gracious, I shall never get into the way of saying Mme. Swann!” It was a recognised pleasantry in the little clan, among those who were not overendowed with wit, to pretend that they could never grow used to saying ‘Mme. Swann.’ “I have been so accustomed to saying Mme. de Crécy that I nearly went wrong again!” Only Mme. Verdurin, when she spoke to Odette, was not content with the nearly, but went wrong on purpose. “Don’t you feel afraid, Odette, living out in the wilds like this? I’m sure I shouldn’t feel at all comfortable, coming home after dark. Besides, it’s so damp. It can’t be at all good for your husband’s eczema. You haven’t rats in the house, I hope!” “Oh, dear no. What a horrid idea!” “That’s a good thing; I was told you had. I’m glad to know it’s not true, because I have a perfect horror of the creatures, and I should never have come to see you again. Goodbye, my dear child, we shall meet again soon; you know what a pleasure it is to me to see you. You don’t know how to put your chrysanthemums in water,” she went on, as she prepared to leave the room, Mme. Swann having risen to escort her. “They are Japanese flowers; you must arrange them the same way as the Japanese.” “I do not agree with Mme. Verdurin, although she is the Law and the Prophets to me in all things! There’s no one like you, Odette, for finding such lovely chrysanthemums, or chrysanthema rather, for it seems that’s what we ought to call them now,” declared Mme. Cottard as soon as the ‘Mistress’ had shut the door behind her. “Dear Mme. Verdurin is not always very kind about other people’s flowers,” said Odette sweetly. “Whom do you go to, Odette,” asked Mme. Cottard, to forestall any further criticism of the ‘Mistress.’ “Lemaître? I must confess, the other day in Lemaître’s window I saw a huge, great pink bush which made me do something quite mad.” But modesty forbade her to give any more precise details as to the price of the bush, and she said merely that the Professor, “and you know, he’s not at all a quicktempered man,” had ‘waved his sword in the air’ and told her that she “didn’t know what money meant.” “No, no, I’ve no regular florist except Debac.” “Nor have I,” said Mme. Cottard, “but I confess that I am unfaithful to him now and then with Lachaume.” “Oh, you forsake him for Lachaume, do you; I must tell Debac that,” retorted Odette, always anxious to shew her wit, and to lead the conversation in her own house, where she felt more at her ease than in the little clan. “Besides, Lachaume is really becoming too dear; his prices are quite excessive, don’t you know; I find his prices impossible!” she added, laughing

    Meanwhile Mme. Bontemps, who had been heard a hundred times to declare that nothing would induce her to go to the Verdurins’, delighted at being asked to the famous Wednesdays, was planning in her own mind how she could manage to attend as many of them as possible. She was not’ aware that Mme. Verdurin liked people not to miss a single one; also she was one of those people whose company is but little sought, who, when a hostess invites them to a series of parties, do not accept and go to them without more ado, like those who know that it is always a pleasure to see them, whenever they have a moment to spare and feel inclined to go out; people of her type deny themselves it may be the first evening and the third, imagining that their absence will be noticed, and save themselves up for the second and fourth, unless it should happen that, having heard from a trustworthy source that the third is to be a particularly brilliant party, they reverse the original order, assuring their hostess that “most unfortunately, we had another engagement last week.” So Mme. Bontemps was calculating how many Wednesdays there could still be left before Easter, and by what means she might manage to secure one extra, and yet not appear to be thrusting herself upon her hostess. She relied upon Mme. Cottard, whom she would have with her in the carriage going home, to give her a few hints. “Oh, Mme. Bontemps, I see you getting up to go; it is very bad of you to give the signal for flight like that! You owe me some compensation for not turning up last Thursday. . . . Come, sit down again, just for a minute. You can’t possibly be going anywhere else before dinner. Really, you won’t let yourself be tempted?” went on Mme. Swann, and, as she held out a plate of cakes, “You know, they’re not at all bad, these little horrors. They don’t look nice, but just taste one, I know you’ll like it.” “On the contrary, they look quite delicious,” broke in Mme. Cottard. “In your house, Odette, one is never short of victuals. I have no need to ask to see the trade-mark; I know you get everything from Rebattet. I must say that I am more eclectic. For sweet biscuits and everything of that sort I repair, as often as not, to Bourbonneux. But I agree that they simply don’t know what an ice means. Rebattet for everything iced, and syrups and sorbets; they’re past masters. As my husband would say, they’re the ne plus ultra.” “Oh, but we just make these in the house. You won’t, really?” “I shan’t be able to eat a scrap of dinner,” pleaded Mme. Bontemps, “but I will just sit down again for a moment; you know, I adore talking to a clever woman like you.” “You will think me highly indiscreet, Odette, but I should so like to know what you thought of the hat Mme. Trombert had on. I know, of course, that big hats are the fashion just now. All the same, wasn’t it just the least little bit exaggerated? And compared to the hat she came to see me in the other day, the one she had on just now was microscopic!” “Oh no, I am not at all clever,” said Odette, thinking that this sounded well. “I am a perfect simpleton, I believe everything people say, and worry myself to death over the least thing.” And she insinuated that she had, just at first, suffered terribly from the thought of having married a man like Swann, who had a separate life of his own and was unfaithful to her. Meanwhile the Prince d’Agrigente, having caught the words “I am not at all clever,” thought it incumbent on him to protest; unfortunately he had not the knack of repartee. “Tut, tut, tut, tut!” cried Mme. Bontemps, “Not clever; you!” “That’s just what I was saying to myself —‘What do I hear?’,” the Prince clutched at this straw, “My ears must have played me false!” “No, I assure you,” went on Odette, “I am really just an ordinary woman, very easily shocked, full of prejudices, living in my own little groove and dreadfully ignorant.” And then, in case he had any news of the Baron de Charlus, “Have you seen our dear Baronet?” she asked him. “You, ignorant!” cried Mme. Bontemps. “Then I wonder what you’d say of the official world, all those wives of Excellencies who can talk of nothing but their frocks. . . . Listen to this, my friend; not more than a week ago I happened to mention Lohengrin to the Education Minister’s wife. She stared at me, and said ‘Lohengrin? Oh, yes, the new review at the Folies-Bergères. I hear it’s a perfect scream!’ What do you say to that, eh? You can’t help yourself; when people say things like that it makes your blood boil. I could have struck her. Because I have a bit of a temper of my own. What do you say, sir;” she turned to me, “was I not right?” “Listen,” said Mme. Cottard, “people can’t help answering a little off the mark when they’re asked a thing like that point blank, without any warning. I know something about it, because Mme. Verdurin also has a habit of putting a pistol to your head.” “Speaking of Mme. Verdurin,” Mme. Bontemps asked Mme. Cottard, “do you know who will be there on Wednesday? Oh, I’ve just remembered that we’ve accepted an invitation for next Wednesday. You wouldn’t care to dine with us on Wednesday week? We could go on together to Mme. Verdurin’s. I should never dare to go there by myself; I don’t know why it is, that great lady always terrifies me.” “I’ll tell you what it is,” replied Mme. Cottard, “what frightens you about Mme. Verdurin is her organ. But you see everyone can’t have such a charming organ as Mme. Swann. Once you’ve found your tongue, as the ‘Mistress’ says, the ice will soon be broken. For she’s a very easy person, really, to get on with. But I can quite understand what you feel; it’s never pleasant to find oneself for the first time in a strange country.” “Won’t you dine with us, too?” said Mme. Bontemps to Mme. Swann. “After dinner we could all go to the Verdurins’ together, ‘do a Verdurin’; and even if it means that the ‘Mistress’ will stare me out of countenance and never ask me to the house again, once we are there we’ll just sit by ourselves and have a quiet talk, I’m sure that’s what I should like best.” But this assertion can hardly have been quite truthful, for Mme. Bontemps went on to ask: “Who do you think will be there on Wednesday week? What will they be doing? There won’t be too big a crowd, I hope!” “I certainly shan’t be there,” said Odette. “We shall just look in for a minute on the last Wednesday of all. If you don’t mind waiting till then ——” But Mme. Bontemps did not appear to be tempted by the proposal

    Granted that the intellectual distinction of a house and its smartness are generally in inverse rather than direct ratio, one must suppose, since Swann found Mme. Bontemps attractive, that any forfeiture of position once accepted has the consequence of making us less particular with regard to the people among whom we have resigned ourselves to finding entertainment, less particular with regard to their intelligence as to everything else about them. And if this be true, men, like nations, must see their culture and even their language disappear with their independence. One of the effects of this indulgence is to aggravate the tendency which after a certain age we have towards finding pleasure in speeches that are a homage to our own turn of mind, to our weaknesses, an encouragement to us to yield to them; that is the age at which a great artist prefers to the company of original minds that of pupils who have nothing in common with him save the letter of his doctrine, who listen to him and offer incense; at which a man or woman of mark, who is living entirely for love, will find that the most intelligent person in a gathering is one perhaps of no distinction, but one who has shewn by some utterance that he can understand and approve what is meant by an existence devoted to gallantry, and has thus pleasantly excited the voluptuous instincts of the lover or mistress; it was the age, too, at which Swann, in so far as he had become the husband of Odette, enjoyed hearing Mme. Bontemps say how silly it was to have nobody in one’s house but duchesses (concluding from that, quite the contrary of what he would have decided in the old days at the Verdurins’, that she was a good creature, extremely sensible and not at all a snob) and telling her stories which made her ‘die laughing’ because she had not heard them before, although she always ‘saw the point’ at once, liked flattering her for his own amusement. “Then the Doctor is not mad about flowers, like you?” Mme. Swann asked Mme. Cottard. “Oh, well, you know, my husband is a sage; be practises moderation in all things. Yet, I must admit, he has a passion.” Her eye aflame with malice, joy, curiosity, “And what is that, pray?” inquired Mme. Bontemps. Quite simply Mme. Cottard answered her, “Reading.” “Oh, that’s a very restful passion in a husband!” cried Mme. Bontemps suppressing an impish laugh. “When the Doctor gets a book in his hands, you know!” “Well, that needn’t alarm you much . . . ” “But it does, for his eyesight. I must go now and look after him, Odette, and I shall come back on the very first opportunity and knock at your door. Talking of eyesight, have you heard that the new house Mme. Verdurin has just bought is to be lighted by electricity? I didn’t get that from my own little secret service, you know, but from quite a different source; it was the electrician himself, Mildé, who told me. You see, I quote my authorities! Even the bedrooms, he says, are to have electric lamps with shades which will filter the light. It is evidently a charming luxury, for those who can afford it. But it seems that our contemporaries must absolutely have the newest thing if it’s the only one of its kind in the world. Just fancy, the sister-in-law of a friend of mine has had the telephone installed in her house! She can order things from her tradesmen without having to go out of doors! I confess that I’ve made the most bare-faced stratagems to get permission to go there one day, just to speak into the instrument. It’s very tempting, but more in a friend’s house than at home. I don’t think I should like to have the telephone in my establishment. Once the first excitement is over, it must be a perfect racket going on all the time. Now, Odette, I must be off; you’re not to keep Mme. Bontemps any longer, she’s looking after me. I must absolutely tear myself away; you’re making me behave in a nice way, I shall be getting home after my husband!”

    And for myself also it was time to return home, before I had tasted those wintry delights of which the chrysanthemums had seemed to me to be the brilliant envelope. These pleasures had not appeared, and yet Mme. Swann did not look as though she expected anything more. She allowed the servants to carry away the tea-things, as who should say “Time, please, gentlemen!” And at last she did say to me: “Really, must you go? Very well; good-bye!” I felt that I might have stayed there without encountering those unknown pleasures, and that my unhappiness was not the cause of my having to forego them. Were they to be found, then, situated not upon that beaten track of hours which leads one always to the moment of departure, but rather upon some cross-road unknown to me along which I ought to have digressed? At least, the object of my visit had been attained; Gilberte would know that I had come to see her parents when she was not at home, and that I had, as Mme. Cottard had incessantly assured me, “made a complete conquest, first shot, of Mme. Verdurin,” whom, she added, she had never seen ‘make so much’ of anyone. (“You and she must have hooked atoms.”) She would know that I had spoken of her as was fitting, with affection, but that I had not that incapacity for living without our seeing one another which I believed to be at the root of the boredom that she had shewn at our last meetings. I had told Mme. Swann that I should not be able to see Gilberte again. I had said this as though I had finally decided not to see her any more. And the letter which I was going to send Gilberte would be framed on those lines. Only to myself, to fortify my courage, I proposed no more than a supreme and concentrated effort, lasting a few days only. I said to myself: “This is the last time that I shall refuse to meet her; I shall accept the next invitation.” To make our separation less difficult to realise, I did not picture it to myself as final. But I knew very well that it would be

    The first of January was exceptionally painful to me that winter. So, no doubt, is everything that marks a date and an anniversary when we are unhappy. But if our unhappiness is due to the loss of some dear friend, our suffering consists merely in an unusually vivid comparison of the present with the past. There was added to this, in my case, the unexpressed hope that Gilberte, having intended to leave me to take the first steps towards a reconciliation, and discovering that I had not taken them, had been waiting only for the excuse of New Year’s Day to write to me, saying: “What is the matter? I am madly in love with you; come, and let us explain things properly; I cannot live without seeing you.” As the last days of the old year went by, such a letter began to seem probable. It was, perhaps, nothing of the sort, but to make us believe that such a thing is probable the desire, the need that we have for it suffices. The soldier is convinced that a certain interval of time, capable of being indefinitely prolonged, will be allowed him before the bullet finds him, the thief before he is taken, men in general before they have to die. That is the amulet which preserves people — and sometimes peoples — not from danger but from the fear of danger, in reality from the belief in danger, which in certain cases allows them to brave it without their actually needing to be brave. It is confidence of this sort, and with as little foundation, that sustains the lover who is counting upon a reconciliation, upon a letter. For me to cease to expect a letter it would have sufficed that I should have ceased to wish for one. However unimportant one may know that one is in the eyes of her whom one still loves, one attributes to her a series of thoughts (though their sum-total be indifference) the intention to express those thoughts, a complication of her inner life in which one is the constant object possibly of her antipathy but certainly of her attention. But to imagine what was going on in Gilberte’s mind I should have required simply the power to anticipate on that New Year’s Day what I should feel on the first day of any of the years to come, when the attention or the silence or the affection or the coldness of Gilberte would pass almost unnoticed by me and I should not dream, should not even be able to dream of seeking a solution of problems which would have ceased to perplex me. When we are in love, our love is too big a thing for us to be able altogether to contain it within us. It radiates towards the beloved object, finds in her a surface which arrests it, forcing it to return to its starting-point, and it is this shock of the repercussion of our own affection which we call the other’s regard for ourselves, and which pleases us more then than on its outward journey because we do not recognise it as having originated in ourselves. New Year’s Day rang out all its hours without there coming to me that letter from Gilberte. And as I received a few others containing greetings tardy or retarded by the overburdening of the mails at that season, on the third and fourth of January I hoped still, but my hope grew hourly more faint. Upon the days that followed I gazed through a mist of tears. This undoubtedly meant that, having been less sincere than I thought in my renunciation of Gilberte, I had kept the hope of a letter from her for the New Year. And seeing that hope exhausted before I had had time to shelter myself behind another, I suffered as would an invalid who had emptied his phial of morphia without having another within his reach. But perhaps also in my case — and these two explanations are not mutually exclusive, for a single feeling is often made up of contrary elements — the hope that I entertained of ultimately receiving a letter had brought to my mind’s eye once again the image of Gilberte, had reawakened the emotions which the expectation of finding myself in her presence, the sight of her, her way of treating me had aroused in me before. The immediate possibility of a reconciliation had suppressed in me that faculty the immense importance of which we are apt to overlook: the faculty of resignation. Neurasthenics find it impossible to believe the friends who assure them that they will gradually recover their peace of mind if they will stay in bed and receive no letters, read no newspapers. They imagine that such a course will only exasperate their twitching nerves. And similarly lovers, who look upon it from their enclosure in a contrary state of mind, who have not begun yet to make trial of it, are unable to believe in the healing power of renunciation

    In consequence of the violence of my palpitations, my doses of caffeine were reduced; the palpitations ceased. Whereupon I asked myself whether it was not to some extent the drug that had been responsible for the anguish that I had felt when I came near to quarrelling with Gilberte, an anguish which I had attributed, on every recurrence of it, to the distressing prospect of never seeing my friend again or of running the risk of seeing her only when she was a prey to the same ill-humour. But if this medicine had been at the root of the sufferings which my imagination must in that case have interpreted wrongly (not that there would be anything extraordinary in that, seeing that, among lovers, the most acute mental suffering assumes often the physical identity of the woman with whom they are living), it had been, in that sense, like the philtre which, long after they have drunk of it, continues to bind Tristan to Isolde. For the physical improvement which the reduction of my caffeine effected almost at once did not arrest the evolution of that grief which my absorption of the toxin had perhaps — if it had not created it — at any rate contrived to render more acute

    Only, as the middle of the month of January approached, once my hopes of a letter on New Year’s Day had been disappointed, once the additional disturbance that had come with their disappointment had grown calm, it was my old sorrow, that of ‘before the holidays,’ which began again. What was perhaps the most cruel thing about it was that I myself was its architect, unconscious, wilful, merciless and patient. The one thing that mattered, my relations with Gilberte, it was I who was labouring to make them impossible by gradually creating out of this prolonged separation from my friend, not indeed her indifference, but what would come to the same thing in the end, my own. It was to a slow and painful suicide of that part of me which was Gilberte’s lover that I was goading myself with untiring energy, with a clear sense not only of what I was presently doing but of what must result from it in the future; I knew not only that after a certain time I should cease to love Gilberte, but also that she herself would regret it and that the attempts which she would then make to see me would be as vain as those that she was making now, no longer because I loved her too well but because I should certainly be in love with some other woman whom I should continue to desire, to wait for, through hours of which I should not dare to divert any particle of a second to Gilberte who would be nothing to me then. And no doubt at that very moment in which (since I was determined not to see her again, unless after a formal request for an explanation or a full confession of love on her part, neither of which was in the least degree likely to come to me now) I had already lost Gilberte, and loved her more than ever, and could feel all that she was to me better than in the previous year when, spending all my afternoons in her company, or as many as I chose, I believed that no peril threatened our friendship — no doubt at that moment the idea that I should one day entertain identical feelings for another was odious to me, for that idea carried me away beyond the range of Gilberte, my love and my sufferings. My love, my sufferings in which through my tears I attempted to discern precisely what Gilberte was, and was obliged to recognise that they did not pertain exclusively to her but would, sooner or later, be some other woman’s portion. So that — or such, at least, was my way of thinking then — we are always detached from our fellow-creatures; when a man loves one of them he feels that his love is not labelled with their two names, but may be born again in the future, may have been born already in the past for another and not for her. And in the time when he is not in love, if he makes up his mind philosophically as to what it is that is inconsistent in love, he will find that the love of which he can speak unmoved he did not, at the moment of speaking, feel, and therefore did not know, knowledge in these matters being intermittent and not outlasting the actual presence of the sentiment. That future in which I should not love Gilberte, which my sufferings helped me to divine although my imagination was not yet able to form a clear picture of it, certainly there would still have been time to warn Gilberte that it was gradually taking shape, that its coming was, if not imminent, at least inevitable, if she herself, Gilberte, did not come to my rescue and destroy in the germ my nascent indifference. How often was I not on the point of writing, or of going to Gilberte to tell her: “Take care. My mind is made up. What I am doing now is my supreme effort. I am seeing you now for the last time. Very soon I shall have ceased to love you.” But to what end? By what authority should I have reproached Gilberte for an indifference which, not that I considered myself guilty on that count, I too manifested towards everything that was not herself? The last time! To me, that appeared as something of immense significance, because I was in love with Gilberte. On her it would doubtless have made just as much impression as those letters in which our friends ask whether they may pay us a visit before they finally leave the country, an offer which, like those made by tiresome women who are in love with us, we decline because we have pleasures of our own in prospect. The time which we have at our disposal every day is elastic; the passions that we feel expand it, those that we inspire contract it; and habit fills up what remains

    Besides, what good would it have done if I had spoken to Gilberte; she would not have understood me. We imagine always when we speak that it is our own ears, our own mind that are listening. My words would have come to her only in a distorted form, as though they had had to pass through the moving curtain of a waterfall before they reached my friend, unrecognisable, giving a foolish sound, having no longer any kind of meaning. The truth which one puts into one’s words does not make a direct path for itself, is not supported by irresistible evidence. A considerable time must elapse before a truth of the same order can take shape in the words themselves. Then the political opponent who, despite all argument, every proof that he has advanced to damn the votary of the rival doctrine as a traitor, will himself have come to share the hated conviction by which he who once sought in vain to disseminate it is no longer bound. Then the masterpiece of literature whidi for the admirers who read it aloud seemed to make self-evident the proofs of its excellence, while to those who listened it presented only a senseless or commonplace image, will by these too be proclaimed a masterpiece, but too late for the author to learn of their discovery. Similarly in love the barriers, do what one may, cannot be broken down from without by him whom they maddeningly exclude; it is when he is no longer concerned with them that suddenly, as the result of aft effort directed from elsewhere, accomplished within the heart of her who did not love him, those barriers which he has charged without success will fall to no advantage. If I had come to Gilberte to tell her of my future indifference and the means of preventing it, she would have assumed from my action that my love for her, the need that I had of her, were even greater than I had supposed, and her distaste for the sight of me would thereby have been increased. And incidentally it is quite true that it was that love for her which helped me, by means of the incongruous states of mind which it successively produced in me, to foresee, more clearly than she herself could, the end of that love. And yet some such warning I might perhaps have addressed, by letter or with my own lips, to Gilberte, after a long enough interval, which would render her, it is true, less indispensable to me, but would also have proved to her that she was not so indispensable. Unfortunately certain persons — of good or evil intent — spoke of me to her in a fashion which must have led her to think that they were doing so at my request. Whenever I thus learned that Cottard, my own mother, even M. de Norpois had by a few ill-chosen words rendered useless all the sacrifice that I had just been making, wasted all the advantage of my reserve by giving me, wrongly, the appearance of having emerged from it, I was doubly angry. In the first place I could no longer reckon from any date but the present my laborious and fruitful abstention which these tiresome people had, unknown to me, interrupted and so brought to nothing. And not only that; I should have less pleasure in seeing Gilberte, who would think of me now no longer as containing myself in dignified resignation, but as plotting in the dark for an interview which she had scorned to grant me. I cursed all the idle chatter of people who so often, without any intention of hurting us or of doing us a service, for no reason, for talking’s sake, often because we ourselves have not been able to refrain from talking in their presence, and because they are indiscreet (as we ourselves are), do us, at a crucial moment, so much harm. It is true that in the grim operation performed for the eradication of our love they are far from playing a part equal to that played by two persons who are in the habit, from excess of good nature in one and of malice in the Other, of undoing everything at the moment when everything is on the point of being settled. But against these two persons we bear no such grudge as against the inopportune Cottards of this world, for the latter of them is the person whom we love and the former is ourself

    Meanwhile, since on almost every occasion of my going to see her Mme. Swann would invite me to come to tea another day, with her daughter, and tell me to reply directly to her, I was constantly writing to Gilberte, and in this correspondence I did not choose the expressions which might, I felt, have won her over, sought only to carve out the easiest channel for the torrent of my tears. For, like desire, regret seeks not to be analysed but to be satisfied. When one begins to love, one spends one’s time, not in getting to know what one’s love really is, but in making it possible to meet next day. When one abandons love one seeks not to know one’s grief but to offer to her who is causing it that expression of it which seems to one the most moving. One says the things which one feels the need of saying, and which the other will not understand, one speaks for oneself alone. I wrote: “I had thought that it would not be possible. Alas, I see now that it is not so difficult.” I said also: “I shall probably not see you again;” I said it while I continued to avoid shewing a coldness which she might think affected, and the words, as I wrote them, made me weep because I felt that they expressed not what I should have liked to believe but what was probably going to happen. For at the next request for a meeting which she would convey to me I should have again, as I had now, the courage not to yield, and, what with one refusal and another, I should gradually come to the moment when, by virtue of not having seen her again, I should not wish to see her. I wept, but I found courage enough to sacrifice, I tasted the sweets of sacrificing the happiness of being with her to the probability of seeming attractive to her one day, a day when, alas, my seeming attractive to her would be immaterial to me. Even the supposition, albeit so far from likely, that at this moment, as she had pretended during the last visit that I had paid her, she loved me, that what I took for the boredom which one feels in the company of a person of whom one has grown tired had been due only to a jealous susceptibility, to a feint of indifference analogous to my own, only rendered my decision less painful. It seemed to me that in years to come, when we had forgotten one another, when I should be able to look back and tell her that this letter which I was now in course of writing had not been for one moment sincere, she would answer, “What, you really did love me, did you? If you had only known how I waited for that letter, how I hoped that you were coming to see me, how I cried when I read it.” The thought, while I was writing it, immediately on my return from her mother’s house, that I was perhaps helping to bring about that very misunderstanding, that thought, by the sadness in which it plunged me, by the pleasure of imagining that I was loved by Gilberte, gave me the impulse to continue my letter

    If, at the moment of leaving Mme. Swann, when her tea-party ended, I was thinking of what I was going to write to her daughter, Mme. Cottard, as she departed, had been filled with thoughts of a wholly different order. On her little ‘tour of inspection’ she had not failed to congratulate Mme. Swann on the new ‘pieces,’ the recent ‘acquisitions’ which caught the eye in her drawing-room. She could see among them some, though only a very few, of the things that Odette had had in the old days in the Rue La Pérouse, for instance her animals carved in precious stones, her fetishes

    For since Mme. Swann had picked up from a friend whose opinion she valued the word ‘dowdy’— which had opened to her a new horizon because it denoted precisely those things which a few years earlier she had considered ‘smart’— all those things had, one after another, followed into retirement the gilded trellis that had served as background to her chrysanthemums, innumerable boxes of sweets from Giroux’s, and the coroneted note-paper (not to mention the coins of gilt pasteboard littered about on the mantelpieces, which, even before she had come to know Swann, a man of taste had advised her to sacrifice). Moreover in the artistic disorder, the studio-like confusion of the rooms, whose walls were still painted in sombre colours which made them as different as possible from the white-enamelled drawing-rooms in which, a little later, you were to find Mme. Swann installed, the Far East recoiled more and more before the invading forces of the eighteenth century; and the cushions which, to make me ‘comfortable,’ Mme. Swann heaped up and buffeted into position behind my back were sprinkled with Louis XV garlands and not, as of old, with Chinese dragons. In the room in which she was usually to be found, and of which she would say, “Yes, I like this room; I use it a great deal. I couldn’t live with a lot of horrid vulgar things swearing at me all the time; this is where I do my work ——” though she never stated precisely at what she was working. Was it a picture? A book, perhaps, for the hobby of writing was beginning to become common among women who liked to ‘do something,’ not to be quite useless. She was surrounded by Dresden pieces (having a fancy for that sort of porcelain, which she would name with an English accent, saying in any connexion: “How pretty that is; it reminds me of Dresden flowers,”), and dreaded for them even more than in the old days for her grotesque figures and her flower-pots the ignorant handling of her servants who must expiate, every now and then, the anxiety that they had caused her by submitting to outbursts of rage at which Swann, the most courteous and considerate of masters, looked on without being shocked. Not that the clear perception of certain weaknesses in those whom we love in any way diminishes our affection for them; rather that affection makes us find those weaknesses charming. Rarely nowadays was it in one of those Japanese wrappers that Odette received her familiars, but rather in the bright and billowing silk of a Watteau gown whose flowering foam she made as though to caress where it covered her bosom, and in which she immersed herself, looked solemn, splashed and sported, with such an air of comfort, of a cool skin and long-drawn breath, that she seemed to look on these garments not as something decorative, a mere setting for herself, but as necessary, in the same way as her ‘tub’ or her daily ‘outing,’ to satisfy the requirements of her style of beauty and the niceties of hygiene. She used often to say that she would go without bread rather than give up ‘art’ and ‘having nice things about her,’ and that the burning of the ‘Gioconda’ would distress her infinitely more than the destruction, by the same element, of ‘millions’ of the people she knew. Theories which seemed paradoxical to her friends, but made her pass among them as a superior woman, and qualified her to receive a visit once a week from the Belgian Minister, so that in the little world whose sun she was everyone would have been greatly astonished to learn that elsewhere — at the Verdurins’, for instance — she was reckoned a fool. It was this vivacity of expression that made Mme. Swann prefer men’s society to women’s. But when she criticised the latter it was always from the courtesan’s standpoint, singling out the blemishes that might lower them in the esteem of men, a lumpy figure, a bad complexion, inability to spell, hairy legs, foul breath, pencilled eyebrows. But towards a woman who had shewn her kindness or indulgence in the past she was more lenient, especially if this woman were now in trouble. She would defend her warmly, saying: “People are not fair to her. I assure you, she’s quite a nice woman really.”

    It was not only the furniture of Odette’s drawing-room, it was Odette herself that Mme. Cottard and all those who had frequented the society of Mme. de Crécy would have found it difficult, if they had not seen her for some little time, to recognise. She seemed to be so much younger. No doubt this was partly because she had grown stouter, was in better condition, seemed at once calmer, more cool, more restful, and also because the new way in which she braided her hair gave more breadth to a face which was animated by an application of pink powder, and into which her eyes and profile, formerly too prominent, seemed now to have been reabsorbed. But another reason for this change lay in the fact that, having reached the turning-point of life, Odette had at length discovered, or invented, a physiognomy of her own, an unalterable ‘character,’ a ‘style of beauty’ and on her incoherent features — which for so long, exposed to every hazard, every weakness of the flesh, borrowing for a moment, at the slightest fatigue, from the years to come, a sort of flickering shadow of anility, had furnished her, well or ill, according to how she was feeling, how she was looking, with a countenance dishevelled, inconstant, formless and attractive — had now set this fixed type, as it were an immortal youthfulness

    Swann had in his room, instead of the handsome photographs that were now taken of his wife, in all of which the same cryptic, victorious expression enabled one to recognise, in whatever dress and hat, her triumphant face and figure, a little old daguerreotype of her, quite plain, taken long before the appearance of this new type, so that the youth and beauty of Odette, which she had not yet discovered when it was taken, appeared to be missing from it. But it is probable that Swann, having remained constant, or having reverted to a different conception of her, enjoyed in the slender young woman with pensive eyes and tired features, caught in a pose between rest and motion, a more Botticellian charm. For he still liked to recognise in his wife one of Botticelli’s figures. Odette, who on the other hand sought not to bring out but to make up for, to cover and conceal the points in herself that did not please her, what might perhaps to an artist express her ‘character’ but in her woman’s eyes were merely blemishes, would not have that painter mentioned in her presence. Swann had a wonderful scarf of oriental silk, blue and pink, which he had bought because it was exactly that worn by Our Lady in the Magnificat. But Mme. Swann refused to wear it. Once only she allowed her husband to order her a dress covered all over with daisies, cornflowers, forget-me-nots and campanulas, like that of the Primavera. And sometimes in the evening, when she was tired, he would quietly draw my attention to the way in which she was giving, quite unconsciously, to her pensive hands the uncontrolled, almost distraught movement of the Virgin who dips her pen into the inkpot that the angel holds out to her, before writing upon the sacred page on which is already traced the word ‘Magnificat.’ But he added, “Whatever you do, don’t say anything about it to her; if she knew she was doing it, she would change her pose at once.”

    Save at these moments of involuntary relaxation, in which Swann essayed to recapture the melancholy cadence of Botticelli, Odette seemed now to be cut out in a single figure, wholly confined within a line which, following the contours of the woman, had abandoned the winding paths, the capricious re-entrants and salients, the radial points, the elaborate dispersions of the fashions of former days, but also, where it was her anatomy that went wrong by making unnecessary digressions within or without the ideal circumference traced for it, was able to rectify, by a bold stroke, the errors of nature, to make up, along a whole section of its course, for the failure as well of the human as of the textile element. The pads, the preposterous ‘bustle’ had disappeared, as well as those tailed corsets which, projecting under the skirt and stiffened by rods of whalebone, had so long amplified Odette with an artificial stomach and had given her the appearance of being composed of several incongruous pieces which there was no individuality to bind together. The vertical fall of fringes, the curve of trimmings had made way for the inflexion of a body which made silk palpitate as a siren stirs the waves, gave to cambric a human expression now that it had been liberated, like a creature that had taken shape and drawn breath, from the long chaos and nebulous envelopment of fashions at length dethroned. But Mme. Swann had chosen, had contrived to preserve some vestiges of certain of these, in the very thick of the more recent fashions that had supplanted them. When in the evening, finding myself unable to work and feeling certain that Gilberte had gone to the theatre with friends, I paid a surprise visit to her parents, I used often to find Mme. Swann in an elegant dishabille the skirt of which, of one of those rich dark colours, blood-red or orange, which seemed always as though they meant something very special, because they were no longer the fashion, was crossed diagonally, though not concealed, by a broad band of black lace which recalled the flounces of an earlier day. When on a still chilly afternoon in Spring she had taken me (before my rupture with her daughter) to the Jardin d’Acclimatation, under her coat, which she opened or buttoned up according as the exercise made her feel warm, the dog-toothed border of her blouse suggested a glimpse of the lapel of some non-existent waistcoat such as she had been accustomed to wear, some years earlier, when she had liked their edges to have the same slight indentations; and her scarf — of that same ‘Scotch tartan’ to which she had remained faithful, but whose tones she had so far softened, red becoming pink and blue lilac, that one might almost have taken it for one of those pigeon’s-breast taffetas which were the latest novelty — was knotted in such a way under her chin, without one’s being able to make out where it was fastened, that one could not help being reminded of those bonnet-strings which were — now no longer worn. She need only ‘hold out’ like this for a little longer and young men attempting to understand her theory of dress would say: “Mme. Swann is quite a period in herself, isn’t she?” As in a fine literary style which overlays with its different forms and so strengthens a tradition which lies concealed among them, so in Mme. Swann’s attire those half-hinted memories of waistcoats or of ringlets, sometimes a tendency, at once repressed, towards the ‘all aboard,’ or even a distant and vague allusion to the ‘chase me’ kept alive beneath the concrete form the unfinished likeness of other, older forms which you would not have succeeded, now, in making a tailor or a dressmaker reproduce, but about which your thoughts incessantly hovered, and enwrapped Mme. Swann in a cloak of nobility — perhaps because the sheer uselessness of these fripperies made them seem meant to serve some more than utilitarian purpose, perhaps because of the traces they preserved of vanished years, or else because there was a sort of personality permeating this lady’s wardrobe, which gave to the most dissimilar of her costumes a distinct family likeness. One felt that she did not dress simply for the comfort or the adornment of her body; she was surrounded by her garments as by the delicate and spiritualised machinery of a whole form of civilisation

    When Gilberte, who, as a rule, gave her tea-parties on the days when her mother was ‘at home,’ had for some reason to go out, and I was therefore free to attend Mme. Swann’s ‘kettledrum,’ I would find her dressed in one of her lovely gowns, some of which were of taffeta, others of gros-grain, or of velvet, or of crêpe-de-Chine, or satin or silk, gowns which, not being loose like those that she generally wore in the house but buttoned up tight as though she were just going out in them, gave to her stay-at-home laziness on those afternoons something alert and energetic. And no doubt the daring simplicity of their cut was singularly appropriate to her figure and to her movements, which her sleeves appeared to be symbolising in colours that varied from day to day: one would have said that there was a sudden determination in the blue velvet, an easy-going good humour in the white taffeta, and that a sort of supreme discretion full of dignity in her way of holding out her arm had, in order to become visible, put on the appearance, dazzling with the smile of one who had made great sacrifices, of the black crêpe-de-Chine. But at the same time these animated gowns took from the complication of their trimmings, none of which had any practical value or served any conceivable purpose, something detached, pensive, secret, in harmony with the melancholy which Mme. Swann never failed to shew, at least in the shadows under her eyes and the drooping arches of her hands. Beneath the profusion of sapphire charms, enamelled four-leaf clovers, silver medals, gold medallions, turquoise amulets, ruby chains and topaz chestnuts there would be, on the dress itself, some design carried out in colour which pursued across the surface of an inserted panel a preconceived existence of its own, some row of little satin buttons, which buttoned nothing and could not be unbuttoned, a strip of braid that sought to please the eye with the minuteness, the discretion of a delicate reminder; and these, as well as the trinkets, had the effect — for otherwise there would have been no possible justification of their presence — of disclosing a secret intention, being a pledge of affection, keeping a secret, ministering to a superstition, commemorating a recovery from sickness, a granted wish, a love affair or a ‘philippine.’ And now and then in the blue velvet of the bodice a hint of ‘slashes,’ in the Henri II style, in the gown of black satin a slight swelling which, if it was in the sleeves, just below the shoulders, made one think of the ‘leg of mutton’ sleeves of 1830, or if, on the other hand, it was beneath the skirt, with its Louis XV paniers, gave the dress a just perceptible air of being ‘fancy dress’ and at all events, by insinuating beneath the life of the present day a vague reminiscence of the past, blended with the person of Mme. Swann the charm of certain heroines of history or romance. And if I were to draw her attention to this: “I don’t play golf,” she would answer, “like so many of my friends. So I should have no excuse for going about, as they do, in sweaters.”

    In the confusion of her drawing-room, on her way from shewing out one visitor, or with a plateful of cakes to ‘tempt’ another, Mme. Swann as she passed by me would take me aside for a moment: “I have special instructions from Gilberte that you are to come to luncheon the day after to-morrow. As I wasn’t sure of seeing you here, I was going to write to you if you hadn’t come.” I continued to resist. And this resistance was costing me steadily less and less, because, however much one may love the poison that is destroying one, when one has compulsorily to do without it, and has had to do without it for some time past, one cannot help attaching a certain value to the peace of mind which one had ceased to know, to the absence of emotion and suffering. If one is not altogether sincere in assuring oneself that one does not wish ever to see again her whom one loves, one would not be a whit more sincere in saying that one would like to see her. For no doubt one can endure her absence only when one promises oneself that it shall not be for long, and thinks of the day on which one shall see her again, but at the same time one feels how much less painful are those daily recurring dreams of a meeting immediate and incessantly postponed than would be an interview which might be followed by a spasm of jealousy, with the result that the news that one is shortly to see her whom one loves would cause a disturbance which would be none too pleasant. What one procrastinates now from day to day is no longer the end of the intolerable anxiety caused by separation, it is the dreaded renewal of emotions which can lead to nothing. How infinitely one prefers to any such interview the docile memory which one can supplement at one’s pleasure with dreams, in which she who in reality does not love one seems, far from that, to be making protestations of her love for one, when one is by oneself; that memory which one can contrive, by blending gradually with it a portion of what one desires, to render as pleasing as one may choose, how infinitely one prefers it to the avoided interview in which one would have to deal with a creature to whom one could no longer dictate at one’s pleasure the words that one would like to hear on her lips, but from whom one would meet with fresh coldness, unlooked-for violence. We know, all of us, when we no longer love, that forgetfulness, that even a vague memory do not cause us so much suffering as an ill-starred love. It was of such forgetfulness that in anticipation I preferred, without acknowledging it to myself, the reposeful tranquillity

    Moreover, whatever discomfort there may be in such a course of psychical detachment and isolation grows steadily less for another reason, namely that it weakens while it is in process of healing that fixed obsession which is a state of love. Mine was still strong enough for me to be able to count upon recapturing my old position in Gilberte’s estimation, which in view of my deliberate abstention must, it seemed to me, be steadily increasing; in other words each of those calm and melancholy days on which I did not see her, coming one after the other without interruption, continuing too without prescription (unless some busy-body were to meddle in my affairs), was a day not lost but gained. Gained to no purpose, it might be, for presently they would be able to pronounce that I was healed. Resignation, modulating our habits, allows certain elements of our strength to be indefinitely increased. Those — so wretchedly inadequate — that I had had to support my grief, on the first evening of my rupture with Gilberte, had since multiplied to an incalculable power. Only, the tendency which everything that exists has to prolong its own existence is sometimes interrupted by sudden impulses to which we give way with all the fewer scruples over letting ourselves go since we know for how many days, for how many months even we have been able, and might still be able to abstain. And often it is when the purse in which we hoard our savings is nearly full that we undo and empty it, it is without waiting for the result of our medical treatment and when we have succeeded in growing accustomed to it that we abandon it. So, one day, when Mme. Swann was repeating her familiar statement of what a pleasure it would be to Gilberte to see me, thus putting the happiness of which I had now for so long been depriving myself, as it were within arm’s length, I was stupefied by the realisation that it was still possible for me to enjoy that pleasure, and I could hardly wait until next day, when I had made up my mind to take Gilberte by surprise, in the evening, before dinner

    What helped me to remain patient throughout the long day that followed was another plan that I had made. From the moment in which everything was forgotten, in which I was reconciled to Gilberte, I no longer wished to visit her save as a lover. Every day she should receive from me the finest flowers that grew. And if Mme. Swann, albeit she had no right to be too severe a mother, should forbid my making a daily offering of flowers, I should find other gifts, more precious and less frequent. My parents did not give me enough money for me to be able to buy expensive things. I thought of a big bowl of old Chinese porcelain which had been left to me by aunt Léonie, and of which Mamma prophesied daily that Françoise would come running to her with an “Oh, it’s all come to pieces!” and that that would be the end of it. Would it not be wiser, in that case, to part with it, to sell it so as to be able to give Gilberte all the pleasure I could. I felt sure that I could easily get a thousand francs for it. I had it tied up in paper; I had grown so used to it that I had ceased altogether to notice it; parting with it had at least the advantage of making me realise what it was like. I took it with me as I started for the Swanns’, and, giving the driver their address, told him to go by the Champs-Elysées, at one end of which was the shop of a big dealer in oriental things, who knew my father. Greatly to my surprise he offered me there and then not one thousand but ten thousand francs for the bowl. I took the notes with rapture. Every day, for a whole year, I could smother Gilberte in roses and lilac. When I left the shop and got into my cab again the driver (naturally enough, since the Swanns lived out by the Bois) instead of taking the ordinary way began to drive me along the Avenue des Champs-Elysées. He had just passed the end of the Rue de Berri when, in the failing light, I thought I saw, close to the Swanns’ house but going in the other direction, going away from it, Gilberte, who was walking slowly, though with a firm step, by the side of a young man with whom she was conversing, but whose face I could not distinguish. I stood up in the cab, meaning to tell the driver to stop; then hesitated. The strolling couple were already some way away, and the parallel lines which their leisurely progress was quietly drawing were on the verge of disappearing in the Elysian gloom. A moment later, I had reached Gilberte’s door. I was received by Mme. Swann. “Oh! she will be sorry!” was my greeting, “I can’t think why she isn’t in. She came home just now from a lesson, complaining of the heat, and said she was going out for a little fresh air with another girl.” “I fancy I passed her in the Avenue des Champs-Elysées.” “Oh, I don’t think it can have been. Anyhow, don’t mention it to her father; he doesn’t approve of her going out at this time of night. Must you go? Good-bye.” I left her, told my driver to go home the same way, but found no trace of the two walking figures. Where had they been? What were they saying to one another in the darkness so confidentially?

    I returned home, desperately clutching my windfall of ten thousand francs, which would have enabled me to arrange so many pleasant surprises for that Gilberte whom now I had made up my mind never to see again. No doubt my call at the dealer’s had brought me happiness by allowing me to expect that in future, whenever I saw my friend, she would be pleased with me and grateful. But if I had not called there, if my cabman had not taken the Avenue des Champs-Elysées, I should not have seen Gilberte with that young man. Thus a single action may have two contradictory effects, and the misfortune that it engenders cancel the good fortune that it has already brought one. There had befallen me the opposite of what so frequently happens. We desire some pleasure, and the material means of obtaining it are lacking. “It is a mistake,” Labruyère tells us, “to be in love without an ample fortune.” There is nothing for it but to attempt a gradual elimination of our desire for that pleasure. In my case, however, the material means had been forthcoming, but at the same moment, if not by a logical effect, at any rate as a fortuitous consequence of that initial success, my pleasure had been snatched from me

    As, for that matter, it seems as though it must always be. As a rule, however, not on the same evening on which we have acquired what makes it possible. Usually, we continue to struggle and to hope for a little longer. But the pleasure can never be realised. If we succeed in overcoming the force of circumstances, nature at once shifts the battle-ground, placing it within ourselves, and effects a gradual change in our heart until it desires something other than what it is going to obtain. And if this transposition has been so rapid that our heart has not had time to change, nature does not, on that account, despair of conquering us, in a manner more gradual, it is true, more subtle, but no less efficacious. It is then, at the last moment, that the possession of our happiness is wrested from us, or rather it is that very possession which nature, with diabolical cleverness, uses to destroy our happiness. After failure in every quarter of the domain of life and action, it is a final incapacity, the mental incapacity for happiness, that nature creates in us. The phenomenon, of happiness either fails to appear, or at once gives way to the bitterest of reactions

    I put my ten thousand francs in a drawer. But they were no longer of any use to me. I ran through them, as it happened, even sooner than if I had sent flowers every day to Gilberte, for when evening came I was always too wretched to stay in the house and used to go and pour out my sorrows upon the bosoms of women whom I did not love. As for seeking to give any sort of pleasure to Gilberte, I no longer thought of that; to visit her house again now could only have added to my sufferings. Even the sight of Gilberte, which would have been so exquisite a pleasure only yesterday, would no longer have sufficed me. For I should have been miserable all the time that I was not actually with her. That is how a woman, by every fresh torture that she inflicts on us, increases, often quite unconsciously, her power over us and at the same time our demands upon her. With each injury that she does us, she encircles us more and more completely, doubles our chains — but halves the strength of those which hitherto we had thought adequate to bind her in order that we might retain our own peace of mind. Only yesterday, had I not been afraid of annoying Gilberte, I should have been content to ask for no more than occasional meetings, which now would no longer have contented me and for which I should now have substituted quite different terms. For in this respect love is not like war; after the battle is ended we renew the fight with keener ardour, which we never cease to intensify the more thoroughly we are defeated, provided always that we are still in a position to give battle. This was not my position with regard to Gilberte. Also I preferred, at first, not to see her mother again. I continued, it is true, to assure myself that Gilberte did not love me, that I had known this for ever so long, that I could see her again if I chose, and, if I did not choose, forget her in course of time. But these ideas, like a remedy which has no effect upon certain complaints, had no power whatsoever to obliterate those two parallel lines which I kept on seeing, traced by Gilberte and the young man as they slowly disappeared along the Avenue des Champs-Elysées. This was a fresh misfortune, which like the rest would gradually lose its force, a fresh image which would one day present itself to my mind’s eye completely purged of every noxious element that it now contained, like those deadly poisons which one can handle without danger, or like a crumb of dynamite which one can use to light one’s cigarette without fear of an explosion. Meanwhile there was in me another force which was striving with all its might to overpower that unwholesome force which still shewed me, without alteration, the figure of Gilberte walking in the dusk: to meet and to break the shock of the renewed assaults of memory, I had, toiling effectively on the other side, imagination. The former force did indeed continue to shew me that couple walking in the Champs-Elysées, and offered me other disagreeable pictures drawn from the past, as for instance Gilberte shrugging her shoulders when her mother asked her to stay and entertain me. But the other force, working upon the canvas of my hopes, outlined a future far more attractively developed than this poor past which, after all, was so restricted. For one minute in which I saw Gilberte’s sullen face, how many were there in which I planned to my own satisfaction all the steps that she was to take towards our reconciliation, perhaps even towards our betrothal. It is true that this force, which my imagination was concentrating upon the future, it was drawing, for all that, from the past. I was still in love with her whom, it is true, I believed that I detested. But whenever anyone told me that I was looking well, or was nicely dressed, I wished that she could have been there to see me. I was irritated by the desire that many people shewed about this time to ask me to their houses, and refused all their invitations. There was a scene at home because I did not accompany my father to an official dinner at which the Bontemps were to be present with their niece Albertine, a young girl still hardly more than a child. So it is that the different periods of our life overlap one another. We scornfully decline, because of one whom we love and who will some day be of so little account, to see another who is of no account to-day, with whom we shall be in love to-morrow, with whom we might, perhaps, had we consented to see her now, have fallen in love a little earlier and who would thus have put a term to our present sufferings, bringing others, it is true, in their place. Mine were steadily growing less. I had the surprise of discovering in my own heart one sentiment one day, another the next, generally inspired by some hope or some fear relative to Gilberte. To the Gilberte whom I kept within me. I ought to have reminded myself that the other, the real Gilberte, was perhaps entirely different from mine, knew nothing of the regrets that I ascribed to her, was thinking probably less about me, not merely than I was thinking about her but that I made her be thinking about me when I was closeted alone with my fictitious Gilberte, wondering what really were her feelings with regard to me and so imagining her attention as constantly directed towards myself

    During those periods in which our bitterness of spirit, though steadily diminishing, still persists, a distinction must be drawn between the bitterness which comes to us from our constantly thinking of the person herself and that which is revived by certain memories, some cutting speech, some word in a letter that we have had from her. The various forms which that bitterness can assume we shall examine when we come to deal with another and later love affair; for the present it must suffice to say that, of these two kinds, the former is infinitely the less cruel. That is because our conception of the person, since it dwells always within ourselves, is there adorned with the halo with which we are bound before long to invest her, and bears the marks if not of the frequent solace of hope, at any rate of the tranquillity of a permanent sorrow. (It must also be observed that the image of a person who makes us suffer counts for little if anything in those complications which aggravate the unhappiness of love, prolong it and prevent our recovery, just as in certain maladies the cause is insignificant beyond comparison with the fever which follows it and the time that must elapse before our convalescence.) But if the idea of the person whom we love catches and reflects a ray of light from a mind which is on the whole optimistic, it is not so with those special memories, those cutting words, that inimical letter (I received only one that could be so described from Gilberte); you would say that the person herself dwelt in those fragments, few and scattered as they were, and dwelt there multiplied to a power of which she falls ever so far short in the idea which we are accustomed to form of her as a whole. Because the letter has not — as the image of the beloved creature has — been contemplated by us in the melancholy calm of regret; we have read it, devoured it in the fearful anguish with which we were wrung by an unforeseen misfortune. Sorrows of this sort come to us in another way; from without; and it is along the road of the most cruel suffering that they have penetrated to our heart. The picture of our friend in our mind, which we believe to be old, original, authentic, has in reality been refashioned by her many times over. The cruel memory is not itself contemporary with the restored picture, it is of another age, it is one of the rare witnesses to a monstrous past. But inasmuch as this past continues to exist, save in ourselves, who have been pleased to substitute for it a miraculous age of gold, a paradise in which all mankind shall be reconciled, those memories, those letters carry us back to reality, and cannot but make us feel, by the sudden pang they give us, what a long way we have been borne from that reality by the baseless hopes engendered daily while we waited for something to happen. Not that the said reality is bound always to remain the same, though that does indeed happen at times. There are in our life any number of women whom we have never wished to see again, and who have quite naturally responded to our in no way calculated silence with a silence as profound. Only in their case as we never loved them, we have never counted the years spent apart from them, and this instance, which would invalidate our whole argument, we are inclined to forget when we are considering the healing effect of isolation, just as people who believe in presentiments forget all the occasions on which their own have not ‘come true.’

    But, after a time, absence may prove efficacious. The desire, the appetite for seeing us again may after all be reborn in the heart which at present contemns us. Only, we must allow time. Now the demands which we ourselves make upon time are no less exorbitant than those of a heart in process of changing. For one thing, time is the very thing that we are least willing to allow, for our own suffering is keen and we are anxious to see it brought to an end. And then, too, the interval of time which the other heart needs to effect its change our own heart will have spent in changing itself also, so that when the goal which we had set ourselves becomes attainable it will have ceased to count as a goal, or to seem worth attaining. This idea, however, that it will be attainable, that what, when it no longer spells any good fortune to us, we shall ultimately secure is not good fortune, this idea embodies a part, but a part only of the truth. Our good fortune accrues to us when we have grown indifferent to it. But the very fact of our indifference will have made us less exacting, and allow us in retrospect to feel convinced that we should have been in raptures over our good fortune had it come at a time when, very probably, it would have seemed to us miserably inadequate. People are not very hard to satisfy nor are they very good judges of matters in which they take no interest. The friendly overtures of a person whom we no longer love, overtures which strike us, in our indifference to her, as excessive, would perhaps have fallen a long way short of satisfying our love. Those tender speeches, that invitation or acceptance, we think only of the pleasure which they would have given us, and not of all those other speeches and meetings by which we should have wished to see them immediately followed, which we should, as likely as not, simply by our avidity for them, have precluded from ever happening. So that we can never be certain that the good fortune which comes to us too late, when we are no longer in love, is altogether the same as that good fortune the want of which made us, at one time, so unhappy. There is only one person who could decide that; our ego of those days; he is no longer with us, and were he to reappear, no doubt that would be quite enough to make our good fortune — whether identical or not — vanish

    Pending these posthumous fulfilments of a dream in which I should not, when the time came, be greatly interested, by dint of my having to invent, as in the days when I still hardly knew Gilberte, speeches, letters in which she implored my forgiveness, swore that she had never loved anyone but myself and besought me to marry her, a series of pleasant images incessantly renewed came by degrees to hold a larger place in my mind than the vision of Gilberte and the young man, which had nothing now to feed upon. At this point I should perhaps have resumed my visits to Mme. Swann but for a dream that came to me, in which one of my friends, who was not, however, one that I could identify, behaved with the utmost treachery towards me and appeared to believe that I had been treacherous to him. Abruptly awakened by the nain which this dream had given me, and finding that it persisted after I was awake, I turned my thoughts back to the dream, racked my brains to discover who could have been the friend whom I had seen in my sleep, the sound of whose name — a Spanish name — was no longer distinct in my ears. Combining Joseph’s part with Pharaoh’s, I set to work to interpret my dream. I knew that, when one is interpreting a dream, it is often a mistake to pay too much attention to the appearance of the people one saw in it, who may perhaps have been disguised or have exchanged faces, like those mutilated saints on the walls of cathedrals which ignorant archaeologists have restored, fitting the body of one to the head of another and confusing all their attributes and names. Those that people bear in a dream are apt to mislead us. The person with whom we are in love is to be recognised only by the intensity of the pain that we suffer. From mine I learned that, though transformed while I was asleep into a young man, the person whose recent betrayal still hurt me was Gilberte. I remembered then that, the last time I had seen her, on the day when her mother had forbidden her to go out to a dancing-lesson, she had, whether in sincerity or in make-believe, declined, laughing in a strange manner, to believe in the genuineness of my feeling for her. And by association this memory brought back to me another. Long before that, it had been Swann who would not believe in my sincerity, nor that I was a suitable friend for Gilberte. In vain had I written to him, Gilberte had brought back my letter and had returned it to me with the same incomprehensible laugh. She had not returned it to me at once: I remembered now the whole of that scene behind the clump of laurels. As soon as one is unhappy one becomes moral. Gilberte’s recent antipathy for me seemed to me a judgment delivered on me by life for my conduct that afternoon. Such judgments one imagines one can escape because one looks out for carriages when one is crossing the street, and avoids obvious dangers. But there are others that take effect within us. The accident comes from the side to which one has not been looking, from inside, from the heart. Gilberte’s words: “If you like, we might go on wrestling,” made me shudder. I imagined her behaving like that, at home perhaps, in the linen-room, with the young man whom I had seen escorting her along the Avenue des Champs-Elysées. And so, just as when, a little time back, I had believed myself to be calmly established in a state of happiness, it had been fatuous in me, now that I had abandoned all thought of happiness, to take for granted that at least I had grown and was going to remain calm. For, so long as our heart keeps enshrined with any permanence the image of another person, it is not only our happiness that may at any moment be destroyed; when that happiness has vanished, when we have suffered, and, later, when we have succeeded in lulling our sufferings to sleep, the thing then that is as elusive, as precarious as ever our happiness was, is our calm. Mine returned to me in the end, for the cloud which, lowering our resistance, tempering our desires, has penetrated, in the train of a dream, the enclosure of our mind, is bound, in course of time, to dissolve, permanence and stability being assured to nothing in this world, not even to grief. Besides, those whose suffering is due to love are, as we say of certain invalids, their own physicians. As consolation can come to them only from the person who is the cause of their grief, and as their grief is an emanation from that person, it is there, in their grief itself, that they must in the end find a remedy: which it will disclose to them at a given moment, for as long as they turn it over in their minds this grief will continue to shew them fresh aspects of the loved, the regretted creature, at one moment so intensely hateful that one has no longer the slightest desire to see her, since before finding enjoyment in her company one would have first to make her suffer, at another so pleasant that the pleasantness in which one has invested her one adds to her own stock of good qualities and finds in it a fresh reason for hope. But even although the anguish that had reawakened in me did at length grow calm, I no longer wished — except just occasionally — to visit Mme. Swann. In the first place because, among those who love and have been forsaken, the state of incessant — even if unconfessed — expectancy in which they live undergoes a spontaneous transformation, and, while to all appearance unchanged, substitutes for its original elements others that are precisely the opposite. The first were the consequences of — a reaction from — the painful incidents which had upset us. The tension of waiting for what is yet to come is mingled with fear, all the more since we desire at such moments, should no message come to us from her whom we love, to act for ourselves, and are none too confident of the success of a step which, once we have taken it, we may find it impossible to follow up. But presently, without our having noticed any change, this tension, which still endures, is sustained, we discover, no longer by our recollection of the past but by anticipation of an imaginary future. From that moment it is almost pleasant. Besides, the first state, by continuing for some time, has accustomed us to living in expectation. The suffering that we felt during those last meetings survives in us still, but is already lulled to sleep. We are in no haste to arouse it, especially as we do not see very clearly what to ask for now. The possession of a little more of the woman whom we love would only make more essential to us the part that we did not yet possess, which is bound to remain, whatever happens, since our requirements are begotten of our satisfactions, an irreducible quantity

    Another, final reason came later on to reinforce this, and to make me discontinue altogether my visits to Mme. Swann. This reason, slow in revealing itself, was not that I had now forgotten Gilberte but that I must make every effort to forget her as speedily as possible. No doubt, now that the keen edge of my suffering was dulled, my visits to Mme. Swann had become once again, for what sorrow remained in me, the sedative and distraction which had been so precious to me at first. But what made the sedative efficacious made the distraction impossible, namely that with these visits the memory of Gilberte was intimately blended. The distraction would be of no avail to me unless it was employed to combat a sentiment which the presence of Gilberte no longer nourished, thoughts, interests, passions in which Gilberte should have no part. These states of consciousness, to which the person whom we love remains a stranger, then occupy a place which, however small it may be at first, is always so much reconquered from the love that has been in unchallenged possession of our whole soul. We must seek to encourage these thoughts, to make them grow, while the sentiment which is no more now than a memory dwindles, so that the new elements introduced into our mind contest with that sentiment, wrest from it an ever increasing part of our soul, until at last the victory is complete. I decided that this was the only way in which my love could be killed, and I was still young enough, still courageous enough to undertake the attempt, to subject myself to that most cruel grief which springs from the certainty that, whatever time one may devote to the effort, it will prove successful in the end. The reason I now gave in my letters to Gilberte for refusing to see her was an allusion to some mysterious misunderstanding, wholly fictitious, which was supposed to have arisen between her and myself, and as to which I had hoped at first that Gilberte would insist upon my furnishing her with an explanation. But, as a matter of fact, never, even in the most insignificant relations in life, does a request for enlightenment come from a correspondent who knows that an obscure, untruthful, incriminating sentence has been written on purpose, so that he shall protest against it, and is only too glad to feel, when he reads it, that he possesses — and to keep in his own hands — the initiative in the coming operations. For all the more reason is this so in our more tender relations, in which love is endowed with so much eloquence, indifference with so little curiosity. Gilberte having never appeared to doubt nor sought to learn more about this misunderstanding, it became for me a real entity, to which I referred anew in every letter. And there is in these baseless situations, in the affectation of coldness, a sort of fascination which tempts one to persevere in them. By dint of writing: “Now that our hearts are sundered,” so that Gilberte might answer: “But they are not. Do explain what you mean,” I had gradually come to believe that they were. By constantly repeating, “Life may have changed for us, it will never destroy the feeling that we had for one another,” in the hope of hearing myself, one day, say: “But there has been no change, the feeling is stronger now than ever it was,” I was living with the idea that life had indeed changed, that we should keep only the memory of a feeling which no longer existed, as certain neurotics, from having at first pretended to be ill, end by becoming chronic invalids. Now, whenever I had to write to Gilberte, I brought my mind back to this imagined change, which, being now tacitly admitted by the silence which she preserved with regard to it in her replies, would in future subsist between us. Then Gilberte ceased to make a point of ignoring it. She too adopted my point of view; and, as in the speeches at official banquets, when the foreign Sovereign who is being entertained adopts practically the same expressions as have just been used by the Sovereign who is entertaining him, whenever I wrote to Gilberte: “Life may have parted us; the memory of the days when we knew one another will endure,” she never failed to respond: “Life may have parted us; it cannot make us forget those happy hours which will always be dear to us both,” (though we should have found it hard to say why or how ‘Life’-had parted us, or what change had occurred). My sufferings were no longer excessive. And yet, one day when I was telling her in a letter that I had heard of the death of our old barley-sugar woman in the Champs-Elysées, as I wrote the words: “I felt at once that this would distress you, in me it awakened a host of memories,” I could not restrain myself from bursting into tears when I saw that I was speaking in the past tense, as though it were of some dead friend, now almost forgotten, of this love of which in spite of myself I had never ceased to think as of a thing still alive, or one that at least might be born again. Nothing can be more affectionate than this sort of correspondence between friends who do not wish to see one another any more. Gilberte’s letters to me had all the delicate refinement of those which I used to write to people who did not matter, and shewed me the same apparent marks of affection, which it was so pleasant for me to receive from her

    But, as time went on, every refusal to see her disturbed me less. And as she became less dear to me, my painful memories were no longer strong enough to destroy by their incessant return the growing pleasure which I found in thinking of Florence, or of Venice. I regretted, at such moments, that I had abandoned the idea of diplomacy, and had condemned myself to a sedentary existence, in order not to be separated from a girl whom I should not see again and had already almost forgotten. We construct our house of life to suit another person, and when at length it is ready to receive her that person does not come; presently she is dead to us, and we live on, a prisoner within the walls which were intended only for her. If Venice seemed to my parents to be a long way off, and its climate treacherous, it was at least quite easy for me to gov without tiring myself, and settle down at Balbec. But to do that I should have had to leave Paris, to forego those visits thanks to which, infrequent as they were, I might sometimes hear Mme. Swann telling me about her daughter. Besides, I was beginning to find in them various pleasures in which Gilberte had no part

    When spring drew round, and with it the cold weather, during an icy Lent and the hailstorms of Holy Week, as Mme. Swann began to find it cold in the house, I used often to see her entertaining her guests in her furs, her shivering hands and shoulders hidden beneath the gleaming white carpet of an immense rectangular muff and a cape, both of ermine, which she had not taken off on coming in from her drive, and which suggested the last patches of the snows of winter, more persistent than the rest, which neither the heat of the fire nor the advancing season had succeeded in melting. And the whole truth about these glacial but already flowering weeks was suggested to me in this drawing-room, which soon I should be entering no more, by other more intoxicating forms of whiteness, that for example of the guelder-roses clustering, at the summits of their tall bare stalks, like the rectilinear trees in pre-Raphaelite paintings, their balls of blossom, divided yet composite, white as annunciating angels and breathing a fragrance as of lemons. For the mistress of Tansonville knew that April, even an ice-bound April, was not barren of flowers, that winter, spring, summer are not held apart by barriers as hermetic as might be supposed by the town-dweller who, until the first hot day, imagines the world as containing nothing but houses that stand naked in the rain. That Mme. Swann was content with the consignments furnished by her Combray gardener, that she did not, by the intervention of her own ‘special’ florist, fill up the gaps left by an insufficiently powerful magic with subsidies borrowed from a precocious Mediterranean shore, I do not for a moment suggest, nor did it worry me at the time. It was enough to fill me with longing for country scenes that, overhanging the loose snowdrifts of the muff in which Mme. Swann kept her hands, the guelder-rose snow-balls (which served very possibly in the mind of my hostess no other purpose than to compose, on the advice of Bergotte, a ‘Symphony in White’ with her furniture and her garments) reminded me that what the Good Friday music in Parsifal symbolised was a natural miracle which one could see performed every year, if one had the sense to look for it, and, assisted by the acid and heady perfume of the other kinds of blossom, which, although their names were unknown to me, had brought me so often to a standstill to gaze at them on my walks round Combray, made Mme. Swann’s drawing-room as virginal, as candidly ‘in bloom,’ without the least vestige of greenery, as overladen with genuine scents of flowers as was the little lane by Tansonville

    But it was still more than I could endure that these memories should be recalled to me. There was a risk of their reviving what little remained of my love for Gilberte. Besides, albeit I no longer felt the least distress during these visits to Mme. Swann, I extended the intervals between them and endeavoured to see as little of her as possible. At most, since I continued not to go out of Paris, I allowed myself an occasional walk with her. Fine weather had come at last, and the sun was hot. As I knew that before luncheon Mme. Swann used to go out every day for an hour, and would stroll for a little in the Avenue du Bois, near the Etoile — a spot which, at that time, because of the people who used to collect there to gaze at the ‘swells’ whom they knew only by name, was known as the ‘Shabby-Genteel Club’— I persuaded my parents, on Sundays (for on weekdays I was busy all morning), to let me postpone my luncheon until long after theirs, until a quarter past one, and go for a walk before it. During May, that year, I never missed a Sunday, for Gilberte had gone to stay with friends in the country. I used to reach the Arc de Triomphe about noon. I kept watch at the entrance to the Avenue, never taking my eyes off the corner of the side-street along which Mme. Swann, who had only a few yards to walk, would come from her house. As by this time many of the people who had been strolling there were going home to luncheon, those who remained were few in number and, for the most part, fashionably dressed. Suddenly, on the gravelled path, unhurrying, cool, luxuriant, Mme. Swann appeared, displaying around her a toilet which was never twice the same, but which I remember as being typically mauve; then she hoisted and unfurled at the end of its long stalk, just at the moment when her radiance was most complete, the silken banner of a wide parasol of a shade that matched the showering petals of her gown. A whole troop of people escorted her; Swann himself, four or five fellows from the Club, who had been to call upon her that morning or whom she had met in the street: and their black or grey agglomeration, obedient to her every gesture, performing the almost mechanical movements of a lifeless setting in which Odette was framed, gave to this woman, in whose eyes alone was there any intensity, the air of looking out in front of her, from among all those men, as from a window behind which she had taken her stand, and made her emerge there, frail but fearless, in the nudity of her delicate colours, like the apparition of a creature of a different species, of an unknown race, and of almost martial strength, by virtue of which she seemed by herself a match for all her multiple escort. Smiling, rejoicing in the fine weather, in the sunshine which had not yet become trying, with the air of calm assurance of a creator who has accomplished his task and takes no thought for anything besides; certain that her clothes — even though the vulgar herd should fail to appreciate them — were the smartest anywhere to be seen, she wore them for herself and for her friends, naturally, without exaggerated attention to them but also without absolute detachment; not preventing the little bows of ribbon upon her bodice and skirt from floating buoyantly upon the air before her, like separate creatures of whose presence there she was not unconscious, but was indulgent enough to let them play if they chose, keeping their own rhythm, provided that they accompanied her where she led the way; and even upon her mauve parasol, which, as often as not, she had not yet ‘put up’ when she appeared on the scene, she let fall now and then, as though upon a bunch of Parma violets, a gaze happy and so kindly that, when it was fastened no longer upon her friends but on some inanimate object, her eyes still seemed to smile. She thus kept open, she made her garments occupy that interval of smartness, of which the men with whom she was on the most familiar terms respected both the existence and its necessity, not without shewing a certain deference, as of profane visitors to a shrine, an admission of their own ignorance, an interval over which they recognised that their friend had (as we recognise that a sick man has over the special precautions that he has to take, or a mother over her children’s education) a competent jurisdiction. No less than by the court which encircled her and seemed not to observe’ the passers-by, Mme. Swann by the lateness of her appearance there at once suggested those rooms in which she had spent so long, so leisurely a morning and to which she must presently return for luncheon; she seemed to indicate their proximity by the unhurrying ease of her progress, like the turn that one takes up and down one’s own garden; of those rooms one would have said that she was carrying about her still the cool, the indoor shade. But for that very reason the sight of her gave me only a stronger sensation of open air and warmth. All the more because, being assured in my own mind that, in accordance with the liturgy, with the ritual in which Mme. Swann was so profoundly versed, her clothes were connected with the time of year and of day by a bond both inevitable and unique, I felt that the flowers upon the stiff straw brim of her hat, the baby-ribbons upon her dress, had been even more naturally born of the month of May than the flowers in gardens and in woods; and to learn what latest change there was in weather or season I had not to raise my eyes higher than to her parasol, open and outstretched like another, a nearer sky, round, clement, mobile, blue. For these rites, if they were of sovereign importance, subjugated their glory (and, consequently, Mme. Swann her own) in condescending obedience to the day, the spring, the sun, none of which struck me as being sufficiently flattered that so elegant a woman had been graciously pleased not to ignore their existence, and had chosen on their account a gown of a brighter, of a thinner fabric, suggesting to me, by the opening of its collar and sleeves, the moist warmness of the throat and wrists that they exposed — in a word, had taken for them all the pains that a great personage takes who, having gaily condescended to pay a visit to common folk in the country, whom everyone, even the most plebeian, knows, yet makes a point of donning, for the occasion, suitable attire. On her arrival I would greet Mme. Swann, she stop me and say (in English) ‘Good morning,’ and smile. We would walk a little way together. And I learned then that these canons according to which she dressed, it was for her own satisfaction that she obeyed them, as though yielding to a Superior Wisdom of which she herself was High Priestess: for if it should happen that, feeling too warm, she threw open or even took off altogether and gave me to carry the jacket which she had intended to keep buttoned up, I would discover in the blouse beneath it a thousand details of execution which had had every chance of remaining there unperceived, like those parts of an orchestral score to which the composer has devoted infinite labour albeit they may never reach the ears of the public: or in the sleeves of the jacket that lay folded across my arm I would see, I would drink in slowly, for my own pleasure or from affection for its wearer, some exquisite detail, a deliciously tinted strip, a lining of mauve satinette which, ordinarily concealed from every eye, was yet just as delicately fashioned as the outer parts, like those gothic carvings on a cathedral, hidden on the inside of a balustrade eighty feet from the ground, as perfect as are the bas-reliefs over the main porch, and yet never seen by any living man until, happening to pass that way upon his travels, an artist obtains leave to climb up there among them, to stroll in the open air, sweeping the whole town with a comprehensive gaze, between the soaring towers

    What enhanced this impression that Mme. Swann was walking in the Avenue as though along the paths of her own garden, was — for people ignorant of her habit of ‘taking exercise’— that she had come there on foot, without any carriage following, she whom, once May had begun, they were accustomed to see, behind the most brilliant ‘turn-out,’ the smartest liveries in Paris, gently and majestically seated, like a goddess, in the balmy air of an immense victoria on eight springs. On foot Mme. Swann had the appearance — especially as her pace began to slacken in the heat of the sun — of having yielded to curiosity, of committing an ‘exclusive’ breach of all the rules of her code, like those Crowned Heads who, without consulting anyone, accompanied by the slightly scandalised admiration of a suite which dares not venture any criticism, step out of their boxes during a gala performance and visit the lobby of the theatre, mingling for a moment or two with the rest of the audience. So between Mme. Swann and themselves the crowd felt that there existed those barriers of a certain kind of opulence which seem to them the most insurmountable that there are. The Faubourg Saint-Germain may have its barriers also, but these are less ‘telling’ to the eyes and imagination of the ‘shabby-genteel.’ These latter, when in the presence of a real personage, more simple, more easily mistaken for the wife of a small professional or business man, less remote from the people, will not feel the same sense of their own inequality, almost of their unworthiness, as dismays them when they encounter Mme. Swann. Of course women of that sort are not themselves dazzled, as the crowd are, by the brilliance of their apparel, they have ceased to pay any attention to it, but only because they have grown used to it, that is to say have come to look upon it more and more as natural and necessary, to judge their fellow creatures according as they are more or less initiated into these luxurious ways: so that (the grandeur which they allow themselves to display or discover in others being wholly material, easily verified, slowly acquired, the lack of it hard to compensate) if such women place a passer-by in the lowest rank of society, it is by the same instinctive process that has made them appear to him as in the highest, that is to say instinctively, at first sight, and without possibility of appeal. Perhaps that special class of society which included in those days women like Lady Israels, who mixed with the women of the aristocracy, and Mme. Swann, who was to get to know them later on, that intermediate class, inferior to the Faubourg Saint-Germain, since it ‘ran after’ the denizens of that quarter, but superior to everything that was not of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, possessing this peculiarity that, while already detached from the world of the merely rich, it was riches still that it represented, but riches that had been canalised, serving a purpose, swayed by an idea that was artistic, malleable gold, chased with a poetic design, taught to smile; perhaps that class — in the same form, at least, and with the same charm — exists no longer. In any event, the women who were its members would not satisfy to-day what was the primary condition on which they reigned, since with advancing age they have lost — almost all of them — their beauty. Whereas it was (just as much as from the pinnacle of her noble fortune) from the glorious zenith of her ripe and still so fragrant summer that Mme. Swann, majestic, smiling, kind, as she advanced along the Avenue du Bois, saw like Hypatia, beneath the slow tread of her feet, worlds revolving. Various young men as they passed looked at her anxiously, not knowing whether their vague acquaintance with her (especially since, having been introduced only once, at the most, to Swann, they were afraid that he might not remember them) was sufficient excuse for their venturing to take off their hats. And they trembled to think of the consequences as they made up their minds, asking themselves whether the gesture, so bold, so sacrilegious a tempting of providence, would not let loose the catastrophic forces of nature or bring down, upon them the vengeance of a jealous god. It provoked only, like the winding of a piece of clockwork, a series of gesticulations from little, responsive bowing figures, who were none other than Odette’s escort, beginning with Swann himself, who raised his tall hat lined in green leather with an exquisite courtesy, which he had acquired in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, but to which was no longer wedded the indifference that he would at one time have shewn. Its place was now taken (as though he had been to some extent permeated by Odette’s prejudices) at once by irritation at having to acknowledge the salute of a person who was none too well dressed and by satisfaction at his wife’s knowing so many people, a mixed sensation to which he gave expression by saying to the smart friends who walked by his side: “Whatl another! Upon my word, I can’t imagine where my wife picks all these fellows up!” Meanwhile, having greeted with a slight movement of her head the terrified youth, who had already passed out of sight though his heart was still beating furiously, Mme. Swann turned to me: “Then it’s all over?” she put it to me, “You aren’t ever coming to see Gilberte again? I’m glad you make an exception of me, and are not going to ‘drop’ me straight away. I like seeing you, but I used to like also the influence you had over my daughter. I’m sure she’s very sorry about it, too. However, I mustn’t bully you, or you’ll make up your mind at once that you never want to set eyes on me again.” “Odette, Sagan’s trying to speak to you!” Swann called his wife’s attention. And there, indeed, was the Prince, as in some transformation scene at the close of a play, or in a circus, or an old painting, wheeling his horse round so as to face her, in a magnificent heroic pose, and doffing his hat with a sweeping theatrical and, so to speak, allegorical flourish in which he displayed all the chivalrous courtesy of a great noble bowing in token of his respect for Woman, were she incarnate in a woman whom it was impossible for his mother or his sister to know. And at every moment, recognised in the depths of the liquid transparency and of the luminous glaze of the shadow which her parasol cast over her, Mme. Swann was receiving the salutations of the last belated horsemen, who passed as though in a cinematograph taken as they galloped in the blinding glare of the Avenue, men from the clubs, the names of whom, which meant only celebrities to the public, Antoine de Castellane, Adalbert de Montmorency and the rest — were for Mme. Swann the familiar names of friends. And as the average span of life, the relative longevity of our memories of poetical sensations is much greater than that of our memories of what the heart has suffered, long after the sorrows that I once felt on Gilberte’s account have faded and vanished, there has survived them the pleasure that I still derive — whenever I close my eyes and read, as it were upon the face of a sundial, the minutes that are recorded between a quarter past twelve and one o’clock in the month of May — from seeing myself once again strolling and talking thus with Mme. Swann beneath her parasol, as though in the coloured shade of a wistaria bower",Marcel Proust,1994,"[96, 97, 91, 80, 86, 86]",6

[Verse 1:]
Worked all day long
I need a man whose back is real strong

393,The River Of Dreams,"In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
From the mountains of faith
To a river so deep
I must be looking for something
Something sacred I lost
But the river is wide
And it's too hard to cross

And even though I know the river is wide
I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore
And try to cross to the opposite side
So I can finally find out what I've been looking for

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the valley of fear
To a river so deep
And I've been searching for something
Taken out of my soul
Something I would never lose
Something somebody stole

I don't know why I go walking at night
But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore
I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
Until I find what it is that I've been looking for

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the jungle of doubt
To a river so deep
I know I'm searching for something
Something so undefined
That it can only be seen
By the eyes of the blind

In the middle of the night

I'm not sure about a life after this
God knows I've never been a spiritual man
Baptized by the fire, I wade into the river
That runs to the promised land

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the desert of truth
To the river so deep
We all end in the ocean
We all start in the streams
We're all carried along
By the river of dreams

In the middle of the night

*repeat x3*

[Verse 1: Dray]

Well I'mma freakit like this and then my nigga Books is next
The crew is from the sewer and the crew is Das EFX
I wrecks cause when I flex I gots to rip it
Excuse me it's the fluid makes me woozy when I sip it
I'm wicked so let me kick it, I got my crew in
I rips just for kicks, I got more chicks than Perdue and
I pick em, pluck em, stuck em with my cock and
No my name ain't Santa but here's somethin for your stockin'
I'm rockin', I gotcha clockin' I'm from the under-
Ground so check my sound because it's bound to make ya wonder

Chorus:

Well I'mma freakit like that, and I'mma freakit like this
Well I'mma freakit like that, and I'mma freakit like this
Well I'mma freakit like that, and I'mma freakit like this
Well I'mma freakit like that, and watch me freakit like this

[Verse 2: Books]

Well I'mma freakit like that with more maneovers than the Heimlich
When I rhyme with the Krayz vertebraes in your spine get
Chills, rippin up the skills, I'm like awesome
And if the mic was Spades, well then my style would run a Boston
So just buckle up and I'll be glad to blast that ass
Out the socket when I rock it like NASA
And plus I'm gettin hysterical wit my lyrical concoctions
I take it to the top then hook up my pops and
I'm dope when I'm swingin more hits than the Oakland A's
I freakit like dat and then I'm swayz

Chorus:

Well I'mma freakit like this, and I'mma freakit like that
*repeat x3*

[Verse 3: Dray]

Well I'mma freakit like this because I be doper than the dopest
I focus on the mic and if you like this you can quote this
I wrote this, I smoke this mic until it's heated
This kid he tried to battle me but then he got defeated
I'm weeded, no bleep that, no keep that, no sell-out
Cause if I ever do you know my crew'll get the hell out
I'm quick with the lingo, my thing go for days
I flip it when I rip it cause I like what it pays
I'm dip dodge dope, y'know I'm gonna getcha
Cause now I rush the mic just like a batter rushed the pitcher

Chorus:

Well I'm freakit like that, and I'mma freakit like this
*repeat x3*

[Verse 4: Books]

Well I'mma freakit like that cause, Black, I bust caps with rough raps
And plus I does the stuff that, flips scripts and dust chaps
Off with the quickness, I'm wicked with the propaganda
And hot damn, I got more props than that Fox Samantha
The hickory-dick slickest nigga wit thee
Raps that sound nifty, weight around a pound sixty
I'm freakin the rap flurries with a black skullie hat on
I'm screamin on chumps like niggas do me from the platform
I'm dope, when I'm swingin more hits than the Oakland A's
I freakit like dat and then I'm swayz

Been with some beautiful girls

One thing still amazes me
Just like a miracle, you have to see to believe

(Cause) God blessed Texas
With His own hand
Brought down angels from the promised land
Gave 'em a place where they could dance
If you wanna see heaven, brother, here's your chance
I've been sent to spread the message

First, He let the sun shine
Then He made the waters deep
Then He gave us moonlight
For all the world to see
Well everybody knows that the Lord works in mysterious ways
He took a rest, then on the very next day

All I can say is that my life is pretty plain
I like watching the puddles gather rain
And all I can do is just pour some tea for two
And speak my point of view, but it's not sane
It's not sane

I just want someone to say to me
""I'll always be there when you wake""
You know, I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today
So stay with me and I'll have it made (I'll have it made)

[Verse 2]
And I don't understand why I sleep all day
And I start to complain that there's no rain
And all I can do is read a book to stay awake
And it rips my life away, but it's a great escape
Escape

All I can say is that my life is pretty plain
You don't like my point of view

For example, ten minutes can't go past without you brushing my thoughts
That's fourteen forty a day so I'll say a hundred and forty four times
I think about you or something like that
Lost match, the fucking thought of you with somebody else
I don't like that; cellular convos getting left in the wrong
'Cause I get so fucking mad when you don't write back
This isn't a song, I just happen to rhyme when I get emo
And find time to write facts, fuck

Crazy who makes me the happiest can make me the saddest
Look Alice, let's get lost in your wonder-er-land, fuck an atlas
You're perfectly perfect for me
What the fuck is this, practice?
Actually, if you even consider leaving
I'll lose a couple screws in due time, I'll stop breathing
And you'll see the meaning of stalking
When I pop out the dark to find you
And that new dude that you're seeing with an attitude
Then proceed to fuck up your evening
Make sure you never meet again like goddamn vegans
'Cause when I hear your name I can not stop cheesing
I love you so much that my heart stops beating when you're leaving
And I'm grieving and my heart starts bleeding
Life without you has no goddamn meaning
Sorry—I'm passive-aggressive for no goddamn reason
It's that my mood change like these goddamn seasons
I fall for you, but I love you

When you're sure you've had enough
Of this life, well, hang on

[Chorus]
Don't let yourself go
'Cause everybody cries
And everybody hurts
Sometimes

[Verse 2]
Sometimes everything is wrong
Now it's time to sing along
When your day is night alone (Hold on, hold on)
If you feel like letting go (Hold on)
If you think you've had too much
Of this life, well, hang on

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody hurts
Take comfort in your friends
And everybody hurts

[Bridge]
Don't throw your hand
Oh, no
Don't throw your hand
If you feel like you're alone
No, no, no, you're not alone

[Verse 3]
If you're on your own in this life
The days and nights are long
When you think you've had too much
Of this life to hang on

[Chorus]
Well, everybody hurts
Sometimes, everybody cries
And everybody hurts
Sometimes
And everybody hurts
Sometimes

[Outro]
So, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Everybody hurts
No, no, no, no, no, you're not alone",R.E.M.,1994,"[92, 74, 68, 67]",4

So whappn Dre tell em whe di fuck a gwaan nuh

[Verse 1]
Creeping down the back street on D's
I got my Glock cocked, cause niggas want these
No soon as I said it, seems I got sweated
By some nigga with a TEC-9, trying to take mine
You wanna make noise, make noise
I make a phone call
My niggas coming like the Gotti boys
Bodies being found on Greenleaf
With their fucking heads cut off
Motherfucker, I'm Dre
So listen to the play-by-play, day-by-day
Rolling in my '4 with 16 switches
And got sounds for the bitches
Clocking all the riches
Got the hollow points for the snitches
So would you just walk on by
Cause I'm too hard to lift
And no, this ain't Aerosmith
It's the motherfucking D-R-E
From the C-P-T
On a rhyming spree, a straight G
Hop back as I pop my top, you trip
I let the hollow points commence to pop, pop, pop
Yeah, cause if it don't stop
I have to put my shit in reverse
Go back and take another spot

[Refrain: Snoop Dogg + Dr. Dre]
Cause I'm rolling in my 6-4
With all the niggas saying

[Hook: Jewell & Ruben Cruz + Dr. Dre]

Hell yeah
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
With all the niggas saying
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
Hell yeah
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride

[Verse 2]
Just another motherfucking day for Dre, so I begin like this
No medallions, dreadlocks or black fists
It's just that gangsta glare
With gangsta raps
That gangsta shit
Makes a gangs of snaps
(Uh, word to the motherfucking streets)
And word to these hyped-ass lyrics and dope beats
That I hit you with
That I get you with
As I groove in my '4 on D's
Hitting the switches
Bitches relax, while I get my proper swerve on
Bumping like a motherfucker ready to get my serve on
But before I hit the dope spot
Gotta get the chronic
The Remy Martin and my soda pop
Now I'm smelling like indo-nesia
Bus stop full of fly bitches and skeezers
On my dick cause my '4 on hit
Pancake, front and back, side to side, and all that shit
So when I crawl, I comes correct
Now, if your bitch in my shit, it's your bitch you check, nigga
Now let the Chevrolet slide
As I dip and make a trip to the south side
Yeah

[Refrain: Snoop Dogg + Dr. Dre]
Rolling in my 6-4
With all the bitches saying

[Hook: Jewell + Dr. Dre]
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
Hell yeah
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
With all the motherfucking bitches saying
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
Know what I'm saying?
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride

[Verse 3]
Check this out
The sun went down when I hit Slauson
On my way to the strip
Now I'm just flossin'
Checking my rearview
Cause niggas, they will do
Jack moves, black fools cause I smack fools
Try to set me up for a 2-11
Fuck around and get caught up in a (1-8-7)
But I don't represent no gangbang
Some niggas like lynching
But I just watch 'em hang
So on and so on
Why don't you let me roll on?
I remember back in the days when I used to have to get my stroll on
Didn't nobody wanna speak
Now everybody peeping out they window
When they hear me beating up the street
Is it Dre? Is it Dre?
That's what they say
Every single motherfucking day
Yo, but I ain't tripping, I'm just kicking it
While my D's keep spinning and these hoes keep grinning I be

[Refrain: Snoop Dogg + Dr. Dre]
Rolling in my 6-4
With everybody saying

[Outro: Jewell + Parliament-Funkadelic (Dr. Dre)]
Swing down, I wanna ride

406,The Song Remembers When,"I was standing at the counter
I was waiting for the change
When I heard that old familiar music start
It was like a lighted match
Had been tossed into my soul
It was like a dam had broken in my heart

After taking every detour
Getting lost and losing track
So that even if I wanted
I could not find my way back
After driving out the memory
Of the way things might have been
After I'd forgotten all about us
The song remembers when

We were rolling through the Rockies
We were up above the clouds
When a station out of Jackson played that song
And it seemed to fit the moment
And the moment seemed to freeze
When we turned the music up and sang along

And there was a God in Heaven
And the world made perfect sense
We were young and were in love
And we were easy to convince
We were headed straight for Eden
It was just around the bend
And though I have forgotten all about it
The song remembers when

I guess something must have happened
And we must have said goodbye
And my heart must have been broken
Though I can't recall just why
The song remembers when

Well, for all the miles between us
And for all the time that's passed
You would think I haven't gotten very far
And I hope my hasty heart
Will forgive me just this once
If I stop to wonder how on Earth you are

But that's just a lot of water
Underneath a bridge I burned
And there's no use in backtracking
Around corners I have turned
Still I guess some things we bury
Are just bound to rise again
For even if the whole world has forgotten
The song remembers when
Yeah, and even if the whole world has forgotten
The song remembers when",Trisha Yearwood,1994,"[98, 90, 82, 82]",4
407,Here Come The Lords,"[DoItAll] Hey yo Funke wake up!
[Mr. Funke] Huh?
[DoItAll] Turn your radio up!
[Mr. Funke] What?!
[DoItAll] It's us!
[Mr. Funke] It's US?!
[DoItAll] Yeah listen to the cut!
It's our style!
[Mr. Funke] Our style?
[DoItAll] Your style
[Mr. Funke] Stop brother
[DoItAll] Aiyyo nigga wake up, ""let me show you some-thin!""
Listen to the way they flip the metaphors and phrases
Listen, listen, it's drivin me CRA-ZY
Cause everytime I do a style and flip it kind of simple
Brothers say, ""That's fat,"" and do it on the demo
From a demo to a promo now a hit on the radio
Next thing you know, they'll be doing our video
[Mr. Funke] Same one?
[DoItAll] Same one! Concepts, whole nine
And crazy similarities to the whole rhyme
I'm not worried though (why?) I'm flippin hits from the grill
And in the underground only real stays real, so umm
Check the skills, the skills are kinda ill and yo
Here Come the Lords, cause we're here to make a kill!

(Here Come the Lords) 7X

[Mr. Funke] Aiyyo, Marley!
[Marley] Aiyyo whassup knocka?
[Mr. Funke] Do you hear these suckas tryin to clock the Lord Chief Rocka
[Marley] Yeah I hear em, they're just a bunch of clones on your bone
[Mr. Funke] Hold up, I'm tryin to figure out where could they get my style from
Aiyyo wait a minute, remember the tape you shopped around a while back?
[Marley] Yo what, wasn't that your boys?
[Mr. Funke] Now they got our stuff down pat!
[Marley] Yo man don't sweat it, just show em why they call you Mr. Funke
Yo Lord Jazz, pass me some of that Brass Brass Monkey

[Mr. Funke]
Here Come the Lords, Here Come the Lords, Mr. Funke don't you see me?
I told you we were comin, you suckas didn't believe me
The Skipper, my Lords style stick like Jack the Ripper
I'm hangin other rappers like your girl hangs on my zipper
Lord Jazz, hit me one time, make it funky
Stop being stingy knocka, pass that Brass Monkey
I step, off a stage, everyone knows, who I am
Grab the mic like Teddy Riley and I _Jam_ (chicka, aawww, Jam)
Give me the mic and watch me wax that ass *horn sample*
Keep the camera moving cause I'm kinda fast *horn sample*
You can trip, you can flip, you could even slip or dip
But you'll never ever rip, Funke style as good as this
Because you sound like you're drugged, you might as well be a singer
Your whimsy couldn't touch me if your name was Sticky Fingaz
So when I come around, don't try to be down, don't try to be down
Just dig the sound, cause here comes the Lords of the Underground

(Here Come the Lords) 7X

[DoItAll]
Well umm, open up the doors and yell, Here Come the Lords
Yell it loud yell it loud, let me hear it from a crowd
I packs em, _In the Closet_ like Michael Jackson
And love to hear the girls go OOH when I'm rockin
So catch it, no stutter in my flow but I wrecks it
And caught you on the dillz from my jam called _Check It_
Check it check it check it check it microphone check it
Yeah, you went wild, cause your moms digs my records
So come on, I'm takin you where the sun don't shine
The underground, but everything is fine
I rhyme, copacetic, unless it gets hectic
Your vocal chords'll get CRACKED, you gets no chloraseptic
So hit em, so chill, chill man chill
I know who used to be but now who's _Top Bill_
Well it's me, and yes, I am back by the Funke
Marley filled the House with Hits so you know The Lords are chunky
We stink, like pee-eww, funk from my shoe
But what about this funk, can two brothers like us do
But get down like James Brown and rock the whole town
Hah! And now The Lords have broke ground

408,Come Inside,"[Chorus]
(Let me) let me, come inside

(Let me) turn down all the lights
(I'll make you) I'll make you feel alright, tonight
Come inside, come inside

[Verse 1]
I'm thinking about you
The last time we made love

So many things that I dream of
I wanna do with you baby
And tonight won't be the same
I wanna come inside I like to hear you call my name

[Bridge 1]
(Slowly) I'll give it to you baby
(Only) if you promise me you'll let your mind run free
Grab a hold and love me totally
I wanna slip and slide dip and dive
Do everything to make it alright tonight
Just let me come inside, oh baby

[Chorus]
(Let me) let me, come inside

If you want me, if you need me
(Let me) turn down all the lights

Just a kiss, I'll taste your sweet sweet lips
All of the passion I have inside of me
I know you won't forget

409,Hopelessly,"[Verse 1]
Staring eyes wide open, gazin' into nothin', runnin' in place again
Going through the motions, in and out as the oceans, repeatin'
Numb to the silence, to the absence of emotion
The sum of the script, nothin' but a click in the rotation, yeah
Sick of the peace of mind that goes along with keepin' on, and I
Can't keep on keepin' on

[Chorus]
Feels like I'm stuck here suspended, at best underwhelming
What's wrong with me? (With me)
My conscious is calling, but the world isn't all it's cracked up to be
I'm hopelessly hopeful (Hopeful, hopelessly hopeful)
That I'm not stuck here suspended
In a world I pretended was right for me (For me), for me

[Post-Chorus]
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
What's wrong with me?
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Strung out on the same old, got an itch for somethin' painful
To feel somethin' real once, to remind myself it's not in my head
Sick of the calm coincidin' with stickin' in and with the line
Can't keep on keepin' on, it all just

[Chorus]
Feels like I'm stuck here suspended, at best underwhelming
What's wrong with me? (With me)
My conscious is calling, but the world isn't all it's cracked up to be
I'm hopelessly hopeful (Hopeful, hopelessly hopeful)
That I'm not stuck here suspended
In a world I pretended was right for me (For me), for me

[Bridge]
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
What's wrong with me?
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
When I close my eyes
(Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh)
When I leave the light
(Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh)

[Chorus]
Inside it feels like I'm stuck here suspended, at best underwhelming
What's wrong with me? (With me)
My conscious is calling, but the world isn't all it's cracked up to be
I'm hopelessly hopeful (Hopeful, hopelessly hopeful)
That I'm not stuck here suspended

[Starlito]
Bitch I got a plug, I lucked up, he got the cheapest ticket
Loudest reefer in the city and I keep it with me
Solo, don’t give a fuck, I got that heater with me
A-a-a-and I'm on it, so that means she can get it
And though my blunt is, I'm far beyond lit
Let's just be honest, I'm a Lebron, bitch
King, you on that nonsense
And if that shit read ""Starlito don’t rip,"" that’s a typo!
Here go Don Trip

[Don Trip]
Mr. Don Trip, Eastside gunsmith
Pockets both clumpy, drums hold hundreds
Yeah I got it covered, get more pussy than a convent
And ye ain't getting none unless she drunk shit
Yeah yo money funny but I got no time for nonsense
I got good humorous, wrist colder than a drumstick
I'm just tryna eat and fast money sound scrumptious
Bitch I got more bills than the library of congress
Still in the trap with a couple bowls of mean green
And I don’t wanna talk or testify, though I've seen things
All about my cake like Ho-Ho’s and Ring Dings
Don Trip and Starlito, we can be the dream team, really
Pistol dirty, leave the scene clean
Lito smoking on some shit I swear look like a string bean
I still make the money fast gotta count it slow
Now bitch I'm goin' in like I found a hole, there we go

[Starlito]
They put me in the mix, I'm up with hope and down with dope
Mc with a Hammer spike my Fanta quarter pound to blow
Now I'm thrown, paranoid to blow up, can't trust shit
This gun dirty and ain't got no safety, can't touch this
Either speakers or a shotty, I keep something in the trunk
And my shooters also snorters, you know pumps and a bump
Hammer time, turn this mother out, understand me?
I do what I want to do say what I wanna say, yeah, Addams Family
Trip, that’s my family, stepbrother, actually
Gotta pray just to make it through the day
And I got that strap with me
In the event of confrontation, it speaks on behalf of me
And she's not a good listener so she say blast me or I have to leave
Gone

[Don Trip]
Nice assist, I got the shot when you pass it back to me
Ridin' with a dirty strap, a couple stacks and a sack of weed
Lay yo bitch down, drippin' wet like she at the beach
But you just yo baby back, Applebees, actually
Try me if you want to become an amputee
I got AK, SK, HK, PK, even .223
My heart pump blood at 2 degrees, I'm cold as ice, no jewelry
And bitch, I been through hell so all this heat is nothing new to me
Truthfully

[Starlito]
We go hard, there ain't much more to explain, nigga
Glad y'all came! Thought it was over? Well it ain't, nigga!

[Don Trip]
Ok, I admit life's a bitch, but I can't quit her
Bitch I ball like Star but I can't dribble
Yeah you rap niggas jokin but I ain't tickled
I'm countin money right now so I can't giggle
Slang everything but Advil
Baby, I'm so deep in that water, you think I had gills
Lil pretty bitch look bad in a glass heel
She suck a hundred dicks and blame it on that half a pill

[Starlito]
Bring the yoppers where your momma and your dad live
It’ll be much louder than a Waka! Flocka! ad-lib
Should never gave her that half a pill
Now I can't get her ass to chill
She intrigued about the shit I rap about and how I do that for real
It went like this, I had a deal' didn’t work, I had to deal
For cash money, ironic; but the chronic in a vacuum-seal
I go hard in the paint like dry bristles
And before I buy some pussy, I probably buy a pistol
And before I die, I'm looking into buying Krystal
Sell squares all night, what's on my menu?
Greens, yams, rolls, uh-uh, no soul food
Said I go ham and hard as a motherfucker before those dudes

[Don Trip]
Fuck y'all picking at me for? Gotta be more than the reefer
I pay my nigga to sneak up, crawl down and delete ya
You rap niggas got your feet up, old ass nigga can't keep up
Yeah y'all got your dough but to me and my folk, y'all look like pizza
I'm balling, bitch, and I'm G’d up, same price for my features
But all these eggs I got for sale, turn any day into Easter
Pound bag like tree shrubs, open, you just see buds
I know I'm offensive but I don’t give an-y fuck

[Starlito]
And I don’t think anyone really wants to see us
I'm in the cut rollin up, I'm on my Wiz Khalifa
Let him tell it, I don’t need blunts, oh well, more for me cuz
If Trip Dale, then you can call me Brennan
And find me in the trees bruh
What happened with all these reruns
Ask Shirley, she'd agree
I mean so the only person see it is me
I got a nigga with an attitude, Eazy-E
Kick a bitch out like, ""Beat it, b""
Or Pam; know you like, ""Damn, that was Kanye's line""
Well, really it was Wayne's line, this ain't the time, but
I go ham! Damn that was my song
Coulda sworn I put it out a year or so ago, but, maybe I'm wrong
Few radio spins, I was doin my than
Did the remix with Gucci Mane
Matter of fact, you can Google it, man
Just type in: LITO

[Don Trip]
More flow than a speedboat, still here chasin the Cheetos
All I see is c-notes, but I live by the g-code
Eff your name then peacoats, red dots, and deep scopes
Bitch I'm here for war like 10-HUT, 3-4
Married to all this sweet dough one here in the gazebo
Bring a tear on my eye and a ring to my hand
As I read my vows to my b-roll
R.I.P to Sweet Jones, this pimp shit got me on
Take a bad bitch and feed her shrimp plates and a T-bone
My license plate read ""KINGKONG,"" extended magazines on
My forty Glock put a bitch nigga to sleep and tell them dream on
My neighborhood is the green zone
So come get you some green son
I would show mercy to y'all rap niggas
But Star keep throwin more beats on

[Starlito]
Nah bro ya can't blame me
You got me back rapping so you can't leave
Might change beats but won't change teams
Grind hard, just aim-squeeze
Trash bag gang, same thing, I fuck yo main squeeze
Don’t tell him that he cold or it'll go to his head... brainfreeze
Let me tell you bout my ‘ponent my brother just didn’t know it
He was cryogenically frozen
Then I tried to steal his mojo then freeze
I was blue on Mortal Kombat, you might catch a chill on contact
You’ll see it when I breethe my finishin move will make you freeze
I ain't talkin 'bout me, I'm talkin 'bout my heart
Just in case you followed all that
Evil cold-hearted killer for what I'm 'bout to do to this track
Freeze, red light, green light go, told me my shit clean I know
Pipes loud as the weed I blow, green a long way fee fi foe
Fumble through the guap but dropping dimes Is just not possible
Still hang with the robbers too, fuck a nigga paper like a prostitute
Whoop a nigga ass, then pop him too
Lookin at the lane while I'm watching the news
My young nigga say, ""What I got to do?""
Drop a whole bag on a robber crew

[Don Trip]
Tell em, ""This our block, y'all got to move""
It's either that or we gotta shoot
Ain't a goddamn thing that a cop could do
It be another half an hour before they got to you
My block much too hot to snooze
So around her, heat's not optional
I might cop me a block or two, eagles, hawks, and cardinals
I'm cold enough to get freezer-burn
Send 50 stacks to my legal firm
Chillin in the trap with a bad bitch
And that bitch might need a perm
But you ain't bout money, why be concerned?
I stuff my shit like a taxidermist
But y'all wanna eat with me and my gang
Bring a lunchbox and pack a thermos

[Starlito]
And a thermal, freeze me, polo to my feet
And my lil four-four yelling, ""Squeeze me!""
Loco with those vocals, I know they're supposed to treat me
But all I know is dro, you’ll find Waldo before you see a C

[Starlito]
We should do this again
It's been very constructive

[Don Trip]
Shout out to the Trash Bag Gang
Sittin fat’s a way of life… Haaah
I know I prolly take shit too far (I do)
But life is too short you dont get two starts (you don't)
The game’s been the same we only get new scars
And i’m one of a kind they don’t make new parts
I’m ice cold i prolly got a blue heart
And I never leave my team like Joe Dumars
Course I keep the iron though i dont use starch
And these niggas scared of bread they don’t do carbs
I would really hate to have to cause you harm
But if life’s really a beach you gettin thrown to the sharks
I dont want the foul’s, all i wanna do is ball
As long as i start we won't lose or draw
And we can clash like a bat to a ball
No fair fights we bringing straps to the brawl
Fuck a peace treaty we attack when it’s war
Don’t you ever turn your back to a sword
I gotta problem? yeah I know
Cause I never learned how to let shit go
So we get it poppin, bitch i promise
That i’m gon make this bitch explode
Cause bitch im throwed, i said bitch im throwed
I said bitch im throwed, i said bitch im throwed
See we get it poppin, bitch i promise
That i’m gon make this bitch explode
Cause bitch i’m throwed

[Starlito]
Boomerang throwed, when i come back i’m shootin off
Smoking like a dual exhaust, hit this all you do is cough
I ain’t got nothin to prove to y'all, but most these dudes is soft
Try me i won’t say one word, but the tool'l talk
I’m throwed, make my money out on the road
And i get money out in these streets
Still got nothin for none of these hoes
Aw naw ain’t on nothin but the dro
In case you wanna know why my eyes so low
Niggas ain't straight, bitches ain't shit
In case you wanna know why I fly solo
Trash Bag Gang, nigga Grind Hard
Anything else, I don’t know
Any other questions? I just wanna rap
Just ask it to my .44
It might bark and bite soon as the hammer strike
My bitch somewhere flippin O’s, she think she Vanna White
And she blow me ‘fore i go out, candle light
Sneaky lil freaky lil bitch, I can’t stand the type
I’ll get mad at her, prolly call your girl, on a random night
Then just pull up, fuck, get on bout my business, i ain't stayin the night
Lito!

[Don Trip]
I gotta problem? yeah I know
Cause I never learned how to let shit go
So we get it poppin, bitch i promise

See we get it poppin, bitch i promise
That i’m gon make this bitch explode
Cause bitch i’m throwed

[Don Trip]
Lil rap niggas say they got beef with me
They upset cause i refuse to let em eat with me
And it cost a couple thousand dollars just to speak with me
I’m wide awake but his lady wanna sleep wit me
I’ll keep ballin in this bitch long as i keep winning
At this rate i’ll hit a home run each inning
I’m all about my dollars, so you can keep your pennies
Sorry, keep your two cents, we don’t need any
After fast money and cheap women
But i’m smart, i know better than to skeet in em
Sean John denim plus I got my heat in em
You know that iron hot enough to put a crease in em
I got my suit and briefcase, bitch i mean business
And i only been to court as a defendant
Jumpin right back in the trap soon as the beat finish
And i told my plug we can meet in 3 minutes

Thanks anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Your opinion doesnt matter over here
But thanks anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
No your opinion never mattered over here
Thanks anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Your opinion doesnt matter over here
But thanks anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
No your opinion never mattered over here


[Starlito]
LITO! (how you spell that?) IDGAF

Find me in the trap, nigga how you catch a animal?
East side gorilla clique, a pack of wild cannibals
Eatin emcee’s, and oyu dont stand a chance with us

Ready for a gunfight, who the lucky challenger?
Everyday a payday, check your calendar

413,As Long As I Can Dream,"I watch the leaves fall to the ground
Suddenly we belled the sun
I carry on the season down
As time's sarander then to now
They said nothings go chemister
But hope will fade away
This is only that I can dream I know
When winter went go very spring We Know
And that's the life inside all me
This is all that I can dream

The sun will say I am moving rise
Now I did expord the simple lines
The stars brights before my eyes
Never mind it in my life
This is only that I can dream I know
When winter went to spring we know

And that's the life inside all me
This is all that I can dream

I close my eyes make a wish
What the way go heres from theres
All I need is a room and the time my through
Like a girl always in the green
And this is only that I can dream I know
When winter went to spring we know
And that's the life inside all me
This is all I can dream

This is only that I can dream I'll show
This is no one that it's heart can go

414,"Soul To Squeeze (From ""Coneheads"")","[Round 1: Mike P]
So it's Mike P versus Chef Trez
I gave Smack that ""Are you for real face?""
Aight bet
Since you Chef why don't tell me how this meal (mil) taste?
To create a wave to serve you that'd be cool Chef
But in the kitchen you gonna always be second to cook
You ain't sous (Tsu) Chef
For those who oppose my presence (presents),my gift from me to you
They done lied to, I'ma lie to you
You praying to the east
Leave it to me to help you to see the truth
I'll rip heads off, son for cats with drive thinking they need a roof
So treat my personal space like a secret and well keep it between me and you
It hurts, and you thought Mike P would be feasible
They gave you a plate thinking you eat
And my hand shout out the bottom like Beetlejuice!
I ain't black and white, suited for crazy shit
Slay ya bitch, it's kid games
Two hands to her face soon as I peek a boo
It's chess moves and you sound pawn
Which means you opposition to a Bishop
I feel (Philly) these cats but just don't choke until you a round off
And to it assist a row (Cyssero) of rappers it's so backwards
I mean why help em up when I can just bomb on a man that's self destructive?
Is your soul bold?
Stone Cold: ya head'll hit the can
Arms out for acting yellow here
Tell Trez to get a cab
In your mom's crib while she's showering playing Demolition Man
Wesley snipes she'll be staring at old weapons through the glass
Think White Men Can't Jump, metal in my hand
Woody Harrelson: Trez, this shit never gonna jam!
Pussy you get the same right twice, deja vu setting
Cookout, chef will get his bell rung like the food ready
Dude deadly, dig a grave and ditch a wack fuck
They knew I bombing on Chef like the kitchen backed up
I don't rap with a mind attached
Playing Atomic Attack, chef tie aprons right?
So I'll put a strap behind his back
What you present to the table ain't appealing face facts
You can't cook for shit Chef, I should've sent the plate back
Fist to guns, I'll still take life with a pound out
Any knife will put a clown down
Try to Air Mike I'll lace up on a loud mouth
Mike P turn into Mike Jai White with a roundhouse
I'll deck a goon, crescent moon
You don't even know hot to close a round out
But as soon as I found I was going at Trez
I asked the world for energy, to start throwing at Trez
You wanna go cool (Goku) if I drop the ball I'll throw it at Trez
What I got to put in super sayan or somethin'?
To leave a spirit bomb you got to make every round go over the head
And don't gas up the tank
I'll give em all the boom, he don't play right
I call an audible
I twist caps, I can't pour out but the 40 do
I'm onto you, break into your house & start sorting through
I left the crib looking Angry Fan's shorty room
And you league hop
Man, you like a relief pitcher
You fuckin' fiend, how you left the Bullpen to pitch that bullshit to another team
I should bring that shit to his house
Jurassic Park; you'll see Jackson sat down with a cig' (Sig) in his mouth
I got a plan now, there'll be a man down
I leave to South Park, I told Ike/Kyle, ""Leave this bro cold wit' a can' mouth""
You fryin' Chef? Let's see how it pan out
I Jay Blac, we can get it shakin' in front of the cam', I'm tired of hand outs
MAC-10, I ain't only rappin' for the moment
Got a bad bitch? Tell her whine, I'm attracted to the motions
Had her back bent, threw a condom on, lit candles for the aroma
Kick the door like ""I'm strapped in! I'll clap you in a coma!
Madness!
You gettin' shot or grazed that's goin' past your clique
You thought this would be a pro test (protest) take a knee, you gettin' Kaepernicked
And you just got engaged to yo' girl, well that's a savage trick
Cause she know when yo' pussy ass die tonight, she claimin' half ya shit
Time bwoy

[Round 1: Chef Trez]
I say this nigga Mike P was better than [?]
Nigga that's how you do shit?
True shit, nigga you a bitch and you won't move shit
Peek a boo? Nigga I'm too slick

All these gimmicks after Daylyt beat yo' ass, nigga I see the gay in you
Hold on, what did he say? Uhhh, somethin' 'bout Angry Fan wife or whatever
Well these caps homeless and you nice, right? Can they stay wit' you?
I said you never really won a battle, nigga body somethin'
Mike P top five? Aight somebody frontin'
Y'all know the last league I was in, but since I came back I've been highly buzzin'
Shit changed since my return from the Pen, I'm Bobby Johnson
You only here cause Gjonaj fucked up, so I'ma need this guy to relax
Cause you can die where you at, I'll rob to attack so don't back slick
Or slick back at the door, this white bitch can get surprised with a MAC
Or if I don't feel he (Philly) real when I cross Mike the trey shootin'; Iverson back
I proved I was a Smooth Criminal since Ryda, you know what you got into
But I'm up to Speed, Demon did well but he did not get you
But it's all Bad cause now you got issues
It's in my Human Nature
Y'all gave Mike, Jack son, you should've known I can Rock With You
I'm blessed with greatness, accept the date, Chef will bake him
Big gun raisin, shit heavy, look like I'm hesitatin'
Blow your legs from under you, make 'em stand out that's decorations
Then blow his brains to God, put his mind in a peaceful place; meditation
She was cuffin' the sack, goin' side-to-side like she Egyptian
You ain't like that bar? It wasn't a crazy written?
You took a cold ass haymaker and started thinkin' gay shit
Aight you trippin', well it's different fam'
Aim two guns at his head, I click the can's
Your head will get rocked between two fifth, that's the Egyptian Dance
I'm armed, peep, sneak by him wit' the large piece
On my tip toes, gotta creep slow, so he don't hear the soft squeeze, gotta get close
Caught bro off of Broad Street, went behind Mike wit' the metal like I'm givin' an award speech
This shit like Marshall Lars
You think you could rock T in the ring and bring death after?
Well I'ma champ, this won't be a loss or a tie, I'm the best bastard
But you though? Surrounded by TEC clappers
You ready for what I'm sin say (sensei), yes and it'll bow (BAOW) in front of you
Yes master, nah, nah let me put that last line in the pot and [?] up somethin' nice
You gunnin', right?
You just a backpacker that wanna write against Smack rappers
I'm meant for the shit, you just fuckin' hype
Well I dump it twice, trap rapper
All you hear is ""bow bow"" in front of Mike
But they say you ill
I'm like, ""Who gon' kill me?"" They say you will
Dude chill, I watched your career and seen you build
But the truth still, this my home
The only time this we see police (Pulice) get a round off in my Station is Fruitville
Now somebody gon' lose, right?
It's either me or you so fallin' back what you need to do
I mean are you decent? True
But y'all gon' be shocked wit' this one
Cause done bit off more than P can chew (Pikachu)
Nigga act brave, I'll shut a pussy down quicker than Backpage
Shots hit him, now white boy movin' slow as his body in Max Payne
You can get popped while rappin', another cat slayed
This infrared, ain't on a King Of The Dot contract
So there can be dots in front of you on this Smack stage
And what's up with the Hadouken
They said are you gonna Ryu kick
Blue fist, kung fu shit
Cause when you got punched in that battle...you forgot ya whole movement
Crazy thing is he ain't fight back
He looked at him like, ""Why you hittin' me? I ain't do shit.""
The whole seen was Ludacris, you should've tried to Move Bitch
But you say I need work, well you need work too nigga
You know URL not fuckin' witchu the right way, did that hurt you nigga?
I'm just sayin', everybody gettin' better names than yours the same
The plans don't concern you killer
They wasn't gonna book you after daylight (Daylyt), you got a curfew nigga
Just remember, without me, you wouldn't be on Born Legacy
You'll just be another Yellow Tape nigga under Born's legacy
Time bwoy

[Round 2: Mike P]
Those rebuttals was crazy as hell boy
I'm impressed
Whatchu hit me wit' like, three of them thangs?
Good rhymin' Trez
But I'll still steal a show, get rough housed, I'll dot a Trez
I set this battle up cause I got the Juice, get the queue (Q), especially after that lil' Ryda mess (Radames)
Got a deck, if it's green you talkin' I'll let a clip fly
Roll up on some keep shit, get loud and leave the kid fried
Bong ya, rasta smoke, black Eagle to lift guy
I left 'Rez (res) on the pipe like I ain't that eager to get high
You told Ryda, ""I'm like the lunch lady, wit' the trey (tray) I'll diss (dish) you kids.""
Yeah I know ya bitch ass ain't say it, you prolly wish you did
He had the scorpion pound, behind the back, it took outta place
But me? I Sub Zeros, with a low pound that blew (blue) by the waist
I'm wit' the shit tonight, clip and pipe
Ya mom get it, that bitch could die
You'll pass a day after I'll lay ya hoe down, that Carrie Fisher life
Got young ones, 21 Savage, they'll get to slice
I'll carve a cross on ya forehead...it's a knife
Pick a fight, this a human vs an Annunaki
Head shot, blew his head red like Lil' Yachty
Timbs close him up now
I'll stomp ya head til' ya Peanut live on the street
""I'm ten toes the fuck down!""
Pussy! Pussy!
Ya arrogance done left the best out the bag
This is Mike P workin' versus Trez makin' trash
Knew I'd leave you laid out, dome hit, NOME 6
You'll hear Smack, then outta nowhere ya chest (Chess) facin' Ave
You had a gay Egyptian dance vs Ryda, that was some different mo'
You pretended to hold- man pause, I do it different though
Your girl was on my shit, tryin' to pop her head up to prevent the choke
So in order to hold her head down I had to hit them folks
This a bulls eye, Bullseye and I'm fit to throw a dart
Have a set execution, French Revolution, I'll rip a bone apart (Bonaparte)
Was sent here, to put the lights out, soon as he show a spark
I X-Men with a blade out the pocket that's Logan sharp
Split ya shit, ribs to chin, I know an Ark 2 animal
You wanna free ya way off this boat with a Genesis
He told me, ""Look, the rhyme amazin'. Better book, alarm is blazin'
I'm Chef Trez.""
Bitch you can't even cook up a conversation
But you here now, cry tears clown
You a sad joke, Mariah Carey, you done kicked off this year on a bad note
Mad quotes, knew to slit man throat
I gotta be bakin' (bacon) so the Chef cracked and white whipped
This bag dope, Neo life
The fight plugged into me, you can see The Matrix
I'm The One to drop zeros in code, you'll be a matrix
Reach and break it
You write like kids in class rushin' last night's homework in before the teacher take it
Trez be like, ""I'm a real OG. And you a chump scrap
Chopper on the whip if I get mad. I'll bust caps
The price? Ya life if you bust back.""
You get the deuce deuce then the nine mil', I charge the .22, plus tax
You don't know how I take on Day'
Rum Nitty the only time ya ID Mike's fake on stage
Boy I used to put drugs on the menus, hella weight copped
Tay Roc, I almost pushed Drugz in the venues
I said I brought metal for poor situations: I'm a cheap bastard
Punch after punch, Trez ain't know I was a speed-bagger
Old pistol, shoot like a new pistol, it's remastered
Blow ya brains on ya bitch, turn the girl of ya dreams into a dream catcher
Ya boo can see the top guy
Schoolin' me, do not try
Ya left ya last class, Trez: ya truancy is not wise
Move at me wit' foolery and you will see a stock rise
The red dot follow Trez: our UAV is online!
But we like those little kids arguin' on the bike, for real
This shit be a joke
I'm a grown ass man, Trez like, ""Man, you don't even smoke.""
Smoke?
Man every time yo' daddy whoop ya ass you cry
Stop bein' bold
Chef Trez, bitch you burnt a ham sandwich
Why the fuck you didn't just eat it cold?
Time, man

[Round 2: Chef Trez]
Outta all that bullshit you just said bro, I don't really believe nothin'
On stage doin' all this Mortal Kombat bullshit, well this geek frontin'
Nigga it is Sub Zero when that heat dumpin'
I'm crouched down, two arms together, like I'm tryin' to freeze somethin'
But it's ""Mike P, god shockin' gift, I'm bringin' thunder
Marketing genius, my Facebook Live does bangin' numbers
You're one dimensional, I hate your style, you're not ready
You should've waited longer
I swear, since I got decked in my first battle, I've hated punchers""
Nigga fuck you
Since I can't hook off on you for real like I tryin' to
I'm just gonna punch this whole fuckin' round to remind you
Why try to mix wit' the Chef?
Throat shot, Mark Henry, he'll dread missin' his neck
Or different approach given him wreck
I'll let two blast off, bad cough
That's a pound in front of his mouth and a fifth to his chest
Pay respect when you face the Chef
They wasn't gon' put you on this shit sucka
You couldn't smoke and fry Day' (Friday) so they removed you; he Chris Tucker
You wasn't ready for Day' he proved you was a wack writer
Y'all remember Pokemon? Well it's crazy
You wanted URL to send a Quill (Cyndaquil) but ya plan backfired
But niggas say I'm low key petty and childish and that's annoyin' me
So I'll go to his house like a lil' kid with a new toy to see
Break in, hear Mike in the bathroom, here goes the lil' boy in me
Shots fly through the door, now it's P (pee) all over the toiletseat
I say my pen different like I was surrounded by guns and drugs, don't get shit twisted
Sub wit' the white, that's a MAC wit' the 'cane, I'm big pimpin'
The OG's forced that fat ass chopper in my hand like, ""You wit' the shits? Grip it.""
Now I'm Smokey in Friday, see how they set me up with these big bitches?
Who confused this guy?
Got him thinkin' he can kill me off the league, well you can try
But this shot for both of us determines what happens next, it's do or die
Aww fuck it, the deuce arrives
You got two 2s? Better shoot wit' pride
As soon as he raise both, his head get popped, he crucified
Clip sparker, Yellow Tape ya Gang, right? Well it gets darker
I'm automatic, no missed targets
This Yellow bitch will get caught wit' a MAC (Mack); Miss Parker
Abuse blocks, tool pops, smooth shot
Henny sippers get wet up, comin' after hours (ours) like skinny dippers
This risky nigga, you can get popped, my crew really killers
We hella deep, like a couple midgets, that's too (two) many (mini) niggas
This square is hatin', he think he over the head but very basic
A rim grazin' dunker, yeah we give you your props, but you barely made it
Get mad, I'll air and blaze it
Dum dums, Jim Carrey made it
A bald head, make it hard for Mike to move; Gary Payton
I fought wit' lions, tigers and bears, but you don't think that the Chef is above you?
You can't war wit' animals, he Denzel in Training Day, police (Pulice) losin' respect in the jungle
This flow bull, but I'ma continue what Mike started
They say I should try barkin' against Mike before I'm slaughtered
Look at that, now the Chef cookin' fast, it's a light order
You ordered 'Lyt but that Watts was too bright on that 'Lyt order
Take the lights off ya, I'm darker, the Night Crawler
Say ""goodnight"" partner
I'm cuttin' ya life shorter
Get ya brains pushed back
You can't see the gun? Try harder
Cause the fo' fo' still (steel) in reach like my father
Are you fuckin' clueless? Nigga these shits we clutchin' ruthless
And I will rob you for everything you got, don't be fuckin' stupid
Hit his block like, ""Yo that's Mike P's crib"" then rush into it
Spot him and snatch Mike (mic) up quick; ""Yo cut the music""
Ave battled him and took off right after abusin' him
I mean Smack gave you chances, but battles you kept losin' 'em
I seen a window of opportunity, get Mike to agree so I can reach a bigger stage then ruin him
See he just like a mic, he ain't been official unless another rapper usin' him

[Round 3: Mike P]
Quick question yo
Ah, when fans think Trez, what y'all think?
Tight lines, scheming, great king, bossin', buckin' heads, eager to be the best veteran?
Yeah that's weird because when I think Trez I think:
Night time, sneezing, aching, coughing, stuffy head, fever so you can rest medicine
I went from fly Quill to Nyquil
Maybe it's me
Can y'all imagine Trez puttin' a baby to sleep?
Like, ""How you wanna sleep baby? I don't stop wit' the harm
You'll get the bye bye (ba ba) in ya mouth, pass the sock to ya mom
You'll get laid down in the crib wit' metal over ya top wit' the charms
Or the bald head come over the shoulder after you get rocked wit' these arms! Awwww""
Boy I'm Leo on the balcony, I'm dishin' out these upper case L's
That dumb talk will get a tagged tongue, get this sucka fake 12's
You jaw jap and I'll shove a TEC down
Gun'll blow, Muppet Show, you won't hear a word comin' out of Chef mouth
You can't grab the moment, off of raps alone, Trez act the boldest
I grab the boulders, throw 'em, bat at ya shoulder
Bad ass who jokin' cause static Trez, 'matics Trez, I return to bad habits Trez
Soon as you stress me out, I'm goin' back to smokin'
BAM! A left cross to his head, he got his dome hooked
BAM! The impact of the four done got his ho shook
BANG! The meat slid off the ribs like it was slow cooked
BANG! He passed wit' his eyes closed that's called a no look
Not done, I took blood from his head and did his boo greasy
Slapped a hand print on that ass, too easy
She didn't recognize the bald head, I thought she knew Beasley
Chin shot, turn your whole cheek red, now she Glueazy
Aye, boy stop it you lost conscious, you should've got black balled, Norbes blocked it
Cold world Trez and you a false prophet
Now my biggest fans get to see guard dropping, career clocked in
Time runs out while Michael Koor watches
And before I'm one step closer to be on NOME poppin'
I cracked open a small door to put your poor stock in
Said you'll never lose to a white boy; stop it
Til this white boy punched you outta the ring; Bernard Hopkins
Box, nobody holdin' Michael down
I flash back like puttin' cards in a bike wheel to get the motorcycle sound
You couldn't last throwin' hands, your Chef T man is drunk
The right hand; Coneheads, you'll go to sleep standin' up
I got power now, since I was the rookie myself
You're here, literally, because of me Trez I booked it myself
This a mirror match, yeah, til I took a look at myself
And pushed Chef to the side like, ""I'll cook it myself.""
I had my sights on Trez, I followed him for weeks at a distance
Got a mold out of his door, made a key for the entrance
Waited for nightfall, it came so I creepily entered
Had a secret treat for dawg, you know, sneaked in a biscuit
The fo' fo', surprisingly low, caught him and his queen in the kitchen
He said, ""Mike Pulice?"" I said, ""Police?"" Put the beam to his missus
And said, ""Chef Trez! Bro are you seein' the mission?!""
He said, ""My bad, my bad it's P.U.L.I.C.E. and not P.-""
""Oooh you think it's a difference.""
Boy I molly crooks, I carry the heat that Riley took
I'm an Annunaki, I followed the Hammurabi book
Get ya shit pushed back, one blink and his body took
Six shots, Chef on the floor like he was drinkin' while he cook
Bad wreckage, you can peep past records
Look at the vinyl Chef, you've been to all these cookin' comps', meet the final chef
This the end of my third, and the start of ya downward spiral
Chef get cracked with Cognac, Henny everywhere, wanna be viral Chef?

[Round 3: Chef Trez]
I say, how you the best wit' rhymin' when you not electrifyin'?
Need new wiring, I battled dudes, went to war wit' plenty crews
And improved tryin' shit, never lose
I got Iron skin, I've been to new environments
I walked through the doors ready for work, ""Are you hiring?""
The police blast rounds at a black crowd til one of layin' flat down
But y'all accept police in this sport, so I'm mad now
I get violated in the streets for lookin' like a hoodlum, every time y'all pass round
So let me return the favor, now police (Pulice) get the pat down!
""Oh Mike P has moments"", dude, that is just bogus
No matter what he brought, nothin' he do gonna help my opponent
But what he does have on this battle, Eminem, one shot, and you gonna Lose Yourself in the moment
But the same angles every battle? That's wild weak
You not real but they don't buy it, Mike's fake; Canal Street
""Kill the Chef"", ""body Trez"", ""Mike 3-0""; child please
I'm in front of Mike tryin' to make a soul lift; I'm Al Green
My type great, this guy type fake
Why fly my way to get a kill? These rounds hittin' home, the drive-by way
Vampire, we seen you die by Day'
My only question, what the fuck is a moment, to a nigga wit' a highlight tape?
Let's go then, wear a vest or protect yo' chin
You ain't a real shooter, you just rap 'bout it
Them fairy tales gon' end
You hold a gun like when you shoot? That's a ""hell on"" then
That's like basketball, coach said, ""When you shoot, keep ya elbow in.""
And you said you used to slit ya wrists, right? See you a sucka nigga
That's white boy shit to the max P and they ain't fuckin' witcha
But my question, how you on stage talkin' like a fuckin' killer?
Bitch you couldn't kill yourself, how you gon' body another nigga?
Sad part is, you'll do anything so you don't get neglected
But you say I battle too much, well I don't expect for you to respect it
I got homies locked up, some of this battle money gets sent to them corrections
Cause they wouldn't be calling collect if I wasn't makin' collections
I do this shit so they can see the exit
Know there's ways to beat oppression
Write down your thoughts and rhyme, keep a positive mind to beat depression
You was strung out at one point, so even I hope you see the message
I receive my blessings, y'all nerds might not like it, but the streets accept it
I go through shit 24/7, the struggle had me out my mind young
So I face my problems night and day, why would I run?
Sleep is the cousin of death, so I'll sleep when my time done
Cause I'd rather have bags under my eyes than be inside one
Ain't no snappin' on the beast, this ain't them niggas you battled who just be rhymin'
Now you rappin' wit' a leash
You Mike P, I'm Mike Lowry, that's a Bad Boy that Will black on the police (Pulice)
I be wild as shit, a young nigga doin' this, and my talent sick
I'm 22, a grown ass man, but don't try me like a child and shit
Y'all gave blood a chance to mix wit' P (pee) like some symptoms after dialysis
Well tryin' to nap on me? Got him wrapped up, that's sleep paralysis
Let's talk about your career, against Haixan you was an average guy
Against Tink you lost, but held ya own with some massive lines
Daylyt taught you a lesson, that's expected, ain't that surpised
But then you played Ricky, thought it was gon' be an easy walk but ain't make it out that Ave alive
And if you can't stand the heat stay the fuck outta the kitchen
I done cooked another nigga...",URLtv,1994,"[57, 60]",2

Yeahhh, torture, motherfucker, what?
Torture, nigga, what?
What? I'll fuckin', I'll fuckin' tie you to a fuckin' bedpost
With your ass cheeks spread out and shit, right?
Put a hanger on a fuckin' stove and let that shit sit there for like a half hour, take it off and stick it in your ass slow like tss
Yeah, I'll fuckin', yeah, I'll fuckin' lay your nuts on a fuckin' dresser, just your nuts layin' on a fuckin' dresser, and bang them shits with a spiked fuckin' bat
Ooh whassup? Blaow!
I'll fuckin', I'll fuckin', pull your fuckin' tongue out your fuckin'
Mouth and stab the shit with a rusty screwdriver, blaoww!
I'll fuckin', I'll fuckin', I'll fuckin' hang you by your fuckin' dick off A fuckin' 12 sto-story building out this motherfucker
I'll fuckin', I'll fuckin', sew your asshole closed, and keep feedin' you And feedin' you, and feedin' you, and feedin' you
Yo, roll the dice, yo, roll the dice
Yo, so it's goin' down like that, huh? Yeah?

[Verse 1: Method Man]
Hey, you, get off my cloud!
You don't know me and you don't know my style
Who be gettin' flam when they come to a jam?
Here I am, here I am, the Method Man
Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake, hey! The Method Man
Don't eat Skippy, Jif or Peter Pan
Peanut butter 'cause I'm not butter
In fact, I snap back like a rubber
Band, I be Sam, Sam-I-Am
And I don't eat green eggs and ham
Style will hit ya, wham! Then goddamn
You'll be like, ""Oh shit, that's the jam!""
Turn it up, now hear me get buck w-w-wild
I'm about to blow, light me up
Upside, downside, inside and outside
Hittin' you from every angle, there's no doubt I
Am the one and only Method Man
The master of the plan, rappin' shit like Saran
Wrap, with some of this and some of that
Hold up (what?) I tawt I tat I putty tat
Over there, but I think he best to beware
Of the diggy dog shit right here
Yippy yippy yay yippy yah yippy yo
Like Deck said, this ain't your average flow
Comin' like rah ooh ah achie kah
Tell me, how you like it so far, baby paw?
The poetry's in motion, coast to coast and
Rub it on your skin like lotion
What's the commotion? Oh my Lord
Another cord chopped by the Wu-Tang sword
""Hey, hey, hey!"" like Fat Albert
It's the Method Man, ain't no if ands about it
It's the Method

[Break: Method Man]
All right, y'all, get your White Owls
Get your meth, get your skins
Don't forget your forty
And we gonna do it like this

[Bridge: Method Man]
I got fat bags of skunk
I got White Owl blunts
And I'm about to go get lifted
Yes, I'm about to go get lifted
I got myself a forty
I got myself a shorty
And I'm about to go and stick it
Yes, I'm about to go and stick it, uhh

[Verse 2: Method Man]
H-U-F-F, huff, and I puff
Blow like snow when the cold wind's blowin'
Zoooom, I hit the mic like boom!
Wrote a song about it, like to hear it? Here it goes
Question, what exactly is a panty raider?
Ill behavior, savior or major flavor
All of the above, oh yeah, plus seducer
Also, flam, I'm the man, call me super
Not an average Joe with an average flow
Doin' average things with average hoes
Yo, I'm super, I'll make a bitch squirm
For my Super Sperm (check it)
Check it, I give it to you raw butt-naked
I smell sess, pass the method
Let's get lifted as I kick ballistic
Missiles and shoot game like a pistol
Clip is loaded when I click bang (bang!)
A Wu-Tang slug hits your brain
J-U-M-P, jump, and I thump
Make girls rumps like pump and Humpty Hump
Wild, the Shaolin style is all in me
Child, the whole damn isle is callin' me
P-A-N-T-Y R-A-I-D-E-R, mad raw, I don't fry
Meaning, no one can burn or toss and turn me
Ooh, I be the super sperm
Chim chiminy chim chim cher-ee
Freak a flow and flow fancy free
Now, how many licks does it take
For me to hit the Tootsie Roll center of a break?
Peep and don't sleep, the crew's mad deep (Wu-Tang!)
Fadin' motherfuckers like bleach
So to each and every crew
You're clear like glass, I can see right through
Your whole damn posse be catchin' 'em all, 'cause you vic'd
And you didn't have friends to begin with, I'm…

416,93 'til Infinity,"[Intro: Tajai]
Yo, whassup? This is Tajai of the mighty Souls of Mischief crew
I'm chillin' with my man Phesto, my man A-Plus
And my man Op', you know he's dope (Yo, yo, yeah)
But right now, y'know, we just maxin' in the studio
We hailin' from East Oakland, California
And, um, sometime,s it gets a little hectic out there
(Haha, we just chilling)
But right now, yo, we gonna up you on how we just chill

[Verse 1: Opio]
Dial the seven digits, call up Bridgette
Her man's a midget; plus she got friends, yo, I can dig it
Here's a 40, swig it, you know it's frigid
I got 'em chillin' in the cooler, break out the ruler
Damn! That's the fattest stog' I ever seen
The weather's heat in Cali
Gettin' weeded makes it feel like Maui
Now we feel the good vibrations
So many females, so much inspiration

[Verse 2: A-Plus]
I get inspired by the blunts too! (Too)
I'll front you (You), if you hang with a bunk crew (Chump)
I roam the strip for bones to pick
When I find one, I'm done
Take her home and quickly do this (Yep)
I need not explain this (Nah)
A-Plus is famous, so get the Amos

[Verse 3: Tajai]
Hey, Miss! Who's there? I'm through there
No time to do hair; the flick's at eight, so get straight
You look great–let's grub now
A rubdown sounds flavor, later there's the theatre (That's nice shit)
We in the cut, the cinema was mediocre
Take her to the crib so I can stroke her

[Verse 4: Phesto]
Kids get broke for their skins when I'm in
Close range, I throws game at your dip
Like handball, ‘cause the man's all that
All phat, I be the chill from 93 'til

[Hook: Souls of Mischief]
Yeah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
Uh-huh, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill… from 93 'til

[Verse 5: A-Plus]
Huh, my black Timbs do me well (Yeah)
When I see a fool and he says he heard me tell (What?)
Another person's busy-ness, I cause dizziness
Until you stop acting like a silly bitch

[Verse 6: Phesto]
Yo, crews are jealous 'cause we get props
The cops wanna stop our fun, but the top
Is where we're dwellin', swell and fat, no sleep
I work fit, and jerks get their hoes sweeped
Under their noses, this bro's quick
They hit blunts and flip once
I'm chillin', ‘cause my crew's close, kid

[Verse 7: Tajai]
I'm posted, most kids accept this as cool
I exit, ‘cause I'm an exception to the rule (Or not!)
I'm steppin' to the cool spots where crews flock
To snare a dip, or see where the shit that's flam-bee
Blam leakin' out his pocket
So I got tons of indo and go to the Owen's basement
My ace been fattenin' up tracks
Time to get prolific with the whiz kid

[Verse 8: Opio]
Greenbacks in stacks, don't even ask
Who got the fat sacks? We can max pumpin' fat tracks
Exchangin' facts about impacts, ‘cause in facts
My freestyle talent overpowers, brothers can't hack it
They lack wit, we got the mack shit
'93 to infinity–kill all that wack shit!

[Hook: Souls of Mischief]
Ah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
Yeah, this is how we chill from 93 'til (Uh-huh)
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 until
This is how we chill from 93 'til (Yeah)

[Verse 9: Phesto]
I be coolin', school's in session, but I'm fresh in
Rappin', so I take time off to never rhyme soft
I'm off on my own shit
With my own clique, roll many backroads
With a fat stog' and blunts, foldin' runts
Holdin' stunts captive with my persona
Plus a bomber, zestin'
Niggas is testin' my patience, but I stay fresh, and …

[Verse 10: Tajai]
Restin' at the mall, attendance on 'noid (Get off!)
But I am shoppin' for my wish to exploit
Some ill fits, some new kicks
I often do this, ‘cause it's the pits not being dipped

[Verse 11: Opio]
Flipped! The flyer attire females desire
Baby, you can step to this if you admire
The ex...traordinary, dapper rapper
Keep tabs on your main squeeze before I tap her

[Verse 12: A-Plus]
I mack her, attack her with the smoothness
I do this, peepin' what my crew gets, huh! (Shit)
Loot, props, respect, and blunts to pass
Crews talk shit, but in my face, they kiss my ass (Smack!)
They bite flows, but we make up new ones
If you're really dope, why ain't you signed yet?
But I get my loot from Jive/Zomba, I'ma bomb ya
You will see, from now 'til infinity

[Hook: Souls of Mischief]
Ahhh (Yeah), this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
Huh! This is how we chill from 93 'til
Yeah! This is how we chill from 93 'til
Aww, yeah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
Yeah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til

[Outro: Souls of Mischief]
Haha! Just coolin' out, y'know what I'm sayin'?
But, but who's chillin' around the land, y'know?
Yo, who's chillin'? I think I know who's chillin'
Yeah, tell me who's chillin' then, Plus
Casual–you know he's chillin'
Yo, Pep Love–he gotta be chillin'
Jay-Biz–you know he's chillin'
Ayo, man, my—my man Snupe is chillin', man
Yo, Mike G–you know he's here chillin'
Yeah, my man Mike P–you know he gotta chill
Del the Funky Homosapien is chillin'
Aye, aye, my man Domino–yo, he's chillin'
Yeah…& it's like that, yeah
Yeah, ill
I could do that

418,Send Me A Lover,"I wasn't searching
To end this hurting
But out of nowhere
You made me feel
I cried about it
I lied about it
And tried to doubt
This could be real
You've touched me far too much
I'm letting go of all the pain
I'm into you in every way
Send me a lover
Someone to believe in
Please send me someone I can hold
Baby now
Send me a lover
A new beginning
Someone to take away the cold
And give me back
What I've been missing
All the love that lays and waits inside your heart
It still astounds me
The way you found me
It's almost too good
To be true
From our first meeting
I had the feeling
The rest of my life
I'd spend with you
I can't just turn my back
On everything I've heard you say
I'm into you in every way
Chorus
I thought that love was only a word
I'd never feel
All the passion I hold inside
Was simply just a dream
Out of your heart you gave to me
I know it's real
And I've fallen
So in love with you

419,Better Than You,"[DAVID]
I hope this won't sound impolite
Or come across as too forthright
But, even though you seem alright, I...
Think I'm better than you!

Now please do keep this thought in mind
That's just my personal conviction
You're smart and fun
You're sweet and kind
I'd call our friendship an addiction

Your shoes are shined, your breath dulce
But still I find I have to say I
Think I might be better than you!

[DANIEL]
You seem impressed with what you've shown
But I don't find it that compelling
You've sung my praise, but not your own
And well, I think that's pretty telling

But while we're on the subject of
How I'm superb and leagues above
You
Ought to know I'm number one!

I know that might be hard to swallow
(La La La La!)
This hurts you just as much as me
(Oooh...)
But when this song is sung then you and I'll know
That you're just a nobody!

[DAVID]
Well, friend I don't know what to say
[DANIEL]
Try starting with your resignation
[DAVID]
Lets end this in the finale
[DANIEL]
I'm dying in anticipation

[DAVID]
You're really great, but let me state
You denigrate and seem to hate
The fact I'll break you, abdicate
Before I can asphyxiate, I
Think I might be better than you!
Don't hate me because it's true!
Just know
I'm
Better than...
[DANIEL]
You've been outdone
Now I've really won
But it was fun
Your end's begun, and...
Now I know I'm better than you!
And I'll prove it to you too!
So watch as I identify
The skill to show I qualify
Like keeping up this camp charade
And tricking kids to drink kool-aid to sacrifice them-
Oh, wait...",Miles Luna,1994,[90],1
