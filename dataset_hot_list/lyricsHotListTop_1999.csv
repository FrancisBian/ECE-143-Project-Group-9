0,Smooth,"[Verse 1]
Man, it's a hot one
Like seven inches from the midday sun
I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone
But you stay so cool
My mu√±equita, my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason, the step in my groove

[Chorus]
And if you say this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth
And it's just like the ocean under the moon
It's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth
Gimme your heart, make it real, or else forget about it

[Verse 2]
I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it would be a crying shame
In every breath and every word
I hear your name calling me out
Out from the barrio, you hear my rhythm from your radio
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow
Turning you round and round

[Chorus]
And if you say this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth
And it's just like the ocean under the moon
It's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth
Gimme your heart, make it real, or else forget about it

[Chorus]
And it's just like the ocean under the moon
It's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth

1,Back At One,"[Verse 1]
It's undeniable
That we should be together
It's unbelievable how I used to say that I'd fall never
The basis is need to know, if you don't know just how I feel
Then let me show you now that I'm for real
If all things in time, time will reveal
Yeah

[Chorus]
One, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl, it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me, and
Four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I start back at one
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
It's so incredible the way things work themselves out
And all emotional, once you know what it's all about, babe
And undesirable for us to be apart
Never would've made it very far
'Cause you know you've got the keys to my heart
'Cause...

[Bridge]
Say farewell to the dark of night, I see the coming of the sun
I feel like a little child whose life has just begun
You came and breathed new life into this lonely heart of mine
You threw out the life-line just in the nick of time

2,I Wanna Love You Forever,"[Verse 1]
You set my soul at ease
Chased darkness out of view
Left your desperate spell on me
Say you feel it too
I know you do
I've got so much more to give
This can't die, I yearn to live
Pour yourself all over me
And I'll cherish every drop here on my knees

[Chorus]
I wanna love you forever
And this is all I'm asking of you
10,000 lifetimes together
Is that so much for you to do?
'Cause from the moment that I saw your face
And felt the fire in your sweet embrace
I swear I knew
I'm gonna love you forever, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
My mind fails to understand
What my heart tells me to do
And I'd give up all I have just to be with you
And that would do
I've always been taught to win
And I never thought I'd fall
Be at the mercy of a man
I've never been
Now I only want to be right where you are

I'm gonna love you forever
Whoa, oh-oh

[Bridge]
In my life, I've learned that heaven never waits, no
Let's take this now before it's gone like yesterday, no
'Cause when I'm with you, there's nowhere else
That I would ever wanna be, no
I'm breathing for the next second I can feel you loving me
I'm gonna love...

[Chorus]
I wanna lover you forever
Oh, and this is all I'm asking of you
10,000 lifetimes together (My love)

3,I Knew I Loved You,"[Verse 1]
Maybe it's intuition
But some things you just don't question
Like in your eyes, I see my future in an instant
And there it goes, I think I've found my best friend

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that it might sound more than a little
Crazy, but I believe...

[Chorus]
I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

[Verse 2]
There's just no rhyme or reason
Only this sense of completion
And in your eyes, I see the missing pieces
I'm searching for, I think I found my way home

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that it might sound more than a little
Crazy, but I believe...

4,My Love Is Your Love,"(clap your hands, yall its alright....)

If tomorrow is judgement day (sing mommy)
And I'm standin' on the front line
And the Lord ask me what I did with my life
I will say I spent it with you

If I wake up in WW 3
I see destruction and poverty
And I feel like I want to go home
It's okay if your commin' with me

Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of this world couldn't hold us

If I lose my fame and fortune
And I'm homeless on the street
And I'm sleepin' in Grand Central Station
It's okay if you're sleepin' with me

As the years they pass us by
We stay young through each other's eyes
And no matter how old we get
It's okay as long as I got you babe

[Chorus]

If I should die this very day
Don't cry, cause on earth we wasn't meant to stay
And no matter what people say
I'll be waiting for you after judgement day

I need to know if you about cuttin'
Or you about frontin', baby, I need to know

[Verse 1]
I spent my last eight checks-s-s on a neck-e-lace
So I better get some sex for this, shit
She wanna sip up on the Crissy Cris
Like it's Christ-e-mas and I'm St. Nicholas
I got her and her sister in that white Benz, dyke twins
I ain't gon' lie, they only fives but together they ten
And would I do 'em again? Hmmm, hmmm
It's like old folks pissin' 'cause it all depends
And it's no coke sniffin', just juice and gin
Grey Goose to get you loose then hit the nigga producin'
The track that got you movin', this track got you movin'
So crazy you don't know what you doin'
You been telling them jokes, and it's not a rumor
I like a girl with a sense of humor
To give me head 'til it ache and it's not a tumor
So let me know what's goin down 'fore I pay for this room 'cause

[Chorus]
I need to know, you down to do whatever?
Down to get it poppin'? Down to get topless? Ohh
I need to know if you about cuttin'
Or you about frontin', baby, I need to know

[Verse 2]
Now if you got it, you got it
And if you don't then you probably won't
Sissy nigga call 'em maricon
I never hit a lady but my game might abuse 'em
Buy 'em boots just to tell 'em that I Jimmy Choose 'em
Take 'em back to confuse 'em
So she don't know if she comin' or goin'
'Cause mami, after I'm cummin', I'm goin'
Back to the show, just frontin' and flowin'
Jewelry stuntin' and glowin', this life is somethin', I know it
And I been known to have a ho or two
'Cause my diamonds yellow like a smoker tooth
I tell 'em step into the vocal booth
Roll a joint, smoke a few, after that I'm pokin' you
After that, it's over, boo, baby, grab your coat and voom

[Chorus]
I need to know, you down to do whatever?
Down to get it poppin'? Down to get topless? Ohh
I need to know if you about cuttin'
Or you about frontin', baby, I need to know

[Verse 3]
Now there's three different levels to relationships
Pollyin' at the club with 'em, talkin', gettin' affectionate
Leavin' and havin' sex with 'em, kickin' 'em out
Trickin' on models, dimes and rats
Now I don't get into that, I kick that habit
I just keep 'em impressed, let 'em seat in the Lex
Never eat 'em unless that fuckin' cat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket, I'm lyin'
I got a nine in my pants and baby, I'm just dyin' for a chance
Who ready to fuck? You ready to fuck off the sizzurp?
Says she ready to cut, then she grabs my scissors
She probably look good, but what's scary to me
Henny make hoes look like Halle Berry to me

Uh, say what? say what? say what?
So baby tell me what's up
Can we ascend to higher heights
And when the path gets rough
We can give into brighter nights breathe with peace
Expound by leaps, and soul to reap, our souls to keep
The passion's deep, and filled with heat
Living this life on the hustle, I barely get enough time
You know me from the platinum, how I stack them and shine
You see a lot of contenders, they try to end up in my world
A reputation known as the untouchable girl
I'm moving on now, trying to make a change in my ways
Be the best that I can be to last me all of my days
Now we can blaze pathways or just take our time
Better holla if ya hear me cause Left Eye gon' shine
My eyes don't lie, see how they glisten when you pass me by
You and I don't need permission to be unified
Surely I done seen and heard of many places
Then I travelled around the world, seen many faces
Don't let another one get near me if you wanna be true
And show me that nobody else can do it better than you
So if you're serious, I'm curious to see what you got
But love is furious cause I believe in blowing up spots

Wonderin' where you are, I wish

Wish for you on a falling star, wondering where you are
Do I ever cross your mind in the warm sunshine?

Never know what she means to me, I fell for the girl that's on TV

Met her at a counter affair
She wore a green dress and everybody was there
Felt out of place
Till she looked into my eyes

Shook your hand around 9 p.m
And I'm never gonna be the same again
Never had to be on a movie screen
To be the leading lady in all my dreams

Shooby-doo-wop and Scooby Snacks, met a fly girl and I can't relax
The only problem is she's a movie star, oh
My friends, they won't believe me if they could only see me
At the risk of soundin' cheesy, I think I fell for the girl on TV

Do I ever cross your mind in the warm sunshine?
She's from the City of Angels like Betty Davis, James Dean, and Gable

They wanna take a picture and they're glad she came
But I just wanna be there when she's down, down

Never had to be on a movie screen
Cause she's the leading lady in all my dreams, come on

Wish you on a falling star, wondering where you are
Do I ever cross your mind in the warm sunshine?
She's from the City of Angels like Betty Davis, James Dean and Gable
Never know what she means to me, I fell for the girl that's on TV

Wish for you on a fallin' star, wonderin' where you are

11,Waiting For Tonight,"[Verse 1]
I went walking down the Boulevard
Past the skateboards and the beggars
I was out looking in the windows
Just out walking, letting my mind roam
If she hung around too much I might take her for granted
But when I was away, she seemed an angel
The only one who really cared about me
The only one without an angle
For so long I've been lonely
Now I'm too weak to fight

I've been waiting for tonight

Oh I've been waiting 'round
For a night like this

I'm gonna trust my intuition
I'm gonna hope I don't get lost

Hey, Matt
Yeah, Tim?
Hey, you talked to Marc lately?
Uh, haven't really talked to him but he looks pretty, uh, down
""He looks pretty, uh, down?""
Yeah, well, maybe we should cheer him up then
What do you, uh, suppose we should do?
Well, does he like butter tarts?

[Verse 1: Marc]
I was lying on the grass of Sunday morning of last week
Indulging in my self-defeat
My mind was thugged, all laced and bugged, all twisted, wrong and beat
A comfortable three feet deep
Now the fuzzy stare from not being there on a confusing morning week
Impaired my tribal lunar speak
And of course you can't become if you only say what you would have done
So I missed a million miles of fun

[Chorus: Marc & (Sharon)]
I know it's up for me
(If you steal my sunshine)
Making sure I'm not in too deep
(If you steal my sunshine)
Keeping versed and on my feet

[Spoken: Tim & Chad]
Chad, come here, come here, come here
Wow, look at her
I know
Man, I've never seen Sharon look so bad before
I did once before, but this is pretty bad
Yeah, what do you think she got up to last night?
Well, I... Sharon, I love you!

[Verse 2: Sharon]
I was frying on the bench slide in the park across the street
L-A-T-E-R that week
My sticky paws were into making straws out of big fat slurpy treats
An incredible eight-foot heap
Now the funny glare to pay a gleaming tare in a staring under heat
Involved an under usual feat
And I'm not only among but I invite who I want to come
So I missed a million miles of fun

[Chorus: Marc & (Sharon)]
I know it's up for me
(If you steal my sunshine)
Making sure I'm not in too deep
(If you steal my sunshine)
Keeping versed and on my feet

Where the ballers don't play courtside

And ride for they brothers
Throw up they C's up and B's up and courts high
And I touched my first 45
When Jordan was wearing that 45
And I couldn't ball, I was like 4'5""
So I stayed inside writing up more rhymes
Well of course I
Had problems with thugs
Who told me that I couldn't get any love
In the city I'm from
Don't know why
I stay here, never said bye
Dad said no, Mom said try
Shorty said who? Now says hi
Teacher sighs
Said what you gonna do
When you leave school
And I said I...

More fire, more fire
As I get higher and higher
My bars get tighter than Rikers

Come on then
I hope you saving your tires
Don't buy my CD
Just to see me
Before the day I expire
I am here Permanente
I swear my name could be Kaiser
No fat lady's gonna sing
Skinny chicks in my choir
And life's a bitch
But I swear that bitch couldn't be finer

No clue till we die

I'm flying first class, like my homeroom's in the sky
And I...

They asking me, Vizzy you really prepared?
I say hell yea, where's my chair?
Keep your throne, leave my wings
I am grown, off something
That got me flyer and feeling super, I am Mario 3

Because I see 'em falling to the strong point
One by one they losin' down the line
A fifty fucked roll or duck pose
Oh nigga, pay me mine! (""Damn nigga!"")
I grab the dice, place your price, all you men are mice
Riffin' as I'm sippin' on a Heineken and gettin' nice
I shake them up, they papes is gettin' deader
Nigga sittin on a Beretta
Said he wanna bet that I don't throw a better
Now the game is surrounded by some money hungry bitches
I put the kisses on my fists and rolled the triple sixes
And once again it be the point that I shoot
That be puttin' crazy loot
In the pocket of my army suit
Now who wanna come fo' another round?
I rolled a fo', a six, hold up
Now I seen a fuckin' pound
Yeah, you niggas know what the name of the game is
I'm in yo' anus
Cee-lo, you know, that shit that made a nigga famous
Hookers up on the ding-dong, I can't go wrong
Rollin' for two hours long and still rollin' strong

[Hook]
4, 5, 6 is in the mix, I'm hittin' them with trips
Headcrack, time to get the bread, black!
4, 5, 6 is in the mix, I'm hittin' them with trips
""Bettin' Grants with the cee-lo champs""

[Verse 2]
I make 'em sweat from beginners to the vets, I'm a threat
Some niggas double up on they fifty bets
I gotta be nice to the dice, so I'm talkin' to 'em
I step back, gave a tap on the sidewalk and threw 'em
Nigga went and put his foot in the way, see
And tried to ace me
Now I got niggas rollin' to that bitch Tracy
Yeah, but Tracy ain't too gentle
Niggas thought she was simple
And loses with two deuces and a fuckin' pimple (""A loser!"")
I crack another brew, sit back and watch what niggas do
Who threw that two? You? I'm rollin' the whole fuckin' crew
One by one niggas come payin', that fell to the trey and
Furlough inside the bait, that's what a nigga sayin'
Your luck is tough, I'm makin' enough to buy a kilo
Uh-oh, look out below, I think I rolled another cee-lo
Pick up my crap, niggas don't get back a dime of that
And keep my hand right by my waist where my nine is at
One more chance and niggas quit, that's on zero
Broke, cryin' broke, I'm doin' backstrokes in cee-notes
Crazy pockets are empty, what a god damn shame
Niggas you know the name of the game
Word the fuck up!

I wake up every morning on a multi-million mission
I call my Cali bitch and told her I'm on the way to visit
My nigga said he'll sell me a hundred for 250
Deal done, a hundred of 'em on the way to Memphis
I stopped in Texas and poured up a pint with Paul Wall
Slam dunking P's around this bitch like John Wall
Nah I'm a Memphis nigga, I slam them bitches like Marc Gasol
R.I.P. to Ida Mae and free all my dogs
I put it all on the line, that's what made me
Mama was drinking when she was pregnant, that's why I'm crazy
I told the major labels ""fuck you, pay me""
Fuck you think this is? I just had my new baby
The fuck you think this is? I ain't shit like these rappers
I'm laughing at 'em 'cus them niggas being fake as wrestlers
Sold out shows, bad bitches, and trappers
I got the streets going stupid, free my nigga Gucci

[Hook]
Whats up with that Dolph nigga? Whats the big deal?
Half a million dollar pack, that's a big flip
You ain't gotta bump my shit nigga, yo bitch will
I see straight through you pussy niggas like a windshield
Send a hundred shots through a pussy nigga windshield
I like my bitches small waist, booty real big
Welcome to Dolph World, that's where I live
I asked God to help me find a plug and do it real big

[Verse 2]
In Dolph World, that's where I live
In the hood, that's where I chill
On the west coast, that's where I sco'
Dirty Texas tea, that's what I po'
Two thousand Franklins stashed in the flo'
She thick then I might put dick in yo ho
Why they love me? Whats the big deal?
Grown ass man still riding big wheel
Push the turbo button, watch the coupe fishtail

26,Get Gone,"[Verse 1]
How many times do I have to say
To get away, get gone?
Flip your shit past another lass's
Humble dwelling
You got your game, made your shot
And you got away with a lot
But I'm not turned on
So put away that meat you're selling

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I do know what's good for me
And I've done what I could for you
But you're not benefiting
And yet I'm sitting
Singing again, sing, sing again

[Chorus]
How can I deal with this
If he won't get with this?
Am I gonna heal from this?
He won't admit to it
Nothing to figure out
I gotta get him out
It's time the truth was out
That he don't give a shit about me

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I do know what's good for me
And I've done what I could for you
But you're not benefiting
And yet I'm sitting
Singing again, sing, sing again

How can I deal with this
If he won't get with this?
Am I gonna heal from this?
He won't admit to it
Nothing to figure out
I gotta get him out
It‚Äôs time the truth was out
That he don't give a shit about me

[Verse 2]
How many times can it escalate
Till it elevates to a place I can't breathe?
And I must decide, if you must deride
That I'm much obliged to up and go
I'll idealize, then realize
That it's no sacrifice because the price is paid
And there's nothing left to grieve
Fuckin' go

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I've done what I've could for you
And I do know what's good for me
And I'm not benefiting
Instead I'm sitting
Singing again, singing again, singing again
Sing, sing again

How can I deal with this
If he won't get with this?
Am I gonna heal from this?
He won't admit to it
Nothing to figure out

30,He Didn't Have To Be,"[Verse 1]
When a single mom goes out on a date with somebody new
It always winds up feelin' more like a job interview
My momma used to wonder if she'd ever meet someone
Who wouldn't find out about me and then turn around and run

[Verse 2]
I met the man I call my dad when I was five years old
He took my mom out to a movie and for once I got to go
A few months later I remember lyin' there in bed
I overheard him pop the question and prayed that she'd say yes

[Chorus]
And then all of a sudden, oh, it seemed so strange to me
How we went from somethin's missin' to a family
Lookin' back all I can say about all the things he did for me
Is I hope I'm at least half the dad that he didn't have to be

[Verse 3]
I met the girl that's now my wife about three years ago
We had the perfect marriage but we wanted somethin' more
Now here I stand surrounded by our family and friends
Crowded 'round the nursery window as they bring the baby in

[Chorus]
And now all of a sudden, oh, it seems so strange to me
How we've gone from somethin's missin' to a family
Lookin' through the glass I think about the man that's standin' next to me

And lookin' back all I can say about all the things he did for me
Is I hope I'm at least half the dad that he didn't have to be

Love rules the world, you feel me

[R. Kelly-Hook]
He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

[Verse 1]
When it hurt I ease the pain girl, caress your frame
Get them worries off your brain girl, I'm in your corner
Do what you want, it's your thing girl, I persist and try but
We one in the same girl, it ain't a game
So I can't play with you, I wanna lay with you
Stay with you, pray with you, grow old and gray with you
In good and bad times, we'll always make it through
Cause what we got is true, no matter what they say to you
I could straight lace you, not just appearance
Stimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits
Be that voice of reason when you ain't tryna hear it
You want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it
Sit her on the sofa, get a little closer
Touch you right, do it like a man's suppose to
Knew you was the one, that's why I chose you
Cause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Your soul ain't a toy, you ain't dealin' with a boy
Feel emptiness inside? I can fill that void
When you spend time with your woman and listen
It shines more than any baguette diamond can glisten
I can't impress you with the cars and the wealth
Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself
I'd rather show you it's heartfelt, make your heart melt
And prove to you you're more important than anything else
Worthwhile, special like my first child
When I see your face it's always like the first time
Our eyes met, I knew we'd be together in a tri-jet
I wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet
Hold you, mold you, don't know, let me show you
Ain't no tellin' what we could grow to
Let it be known, I told you
And I'mma be there for whatever you go through, my love's true

[Hook]

[R. Kelly-Bridge]
Don't let him sing you a sad song (No baby)
Waiting for love like this too long
(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on him, baby)
All that you need I can give you
(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on)
I do, satisfy you
(You don't have to wait on him)

[Verse 3]
I'm the light when you can't see
I'm that air when you can't breathe
I'm that feeling when you can't leave
Some doubt, some believe, some lie, cheat, and deceive
So it's only you and me
When you weak, I'll make you strong, here's where you belong
I ain't perfect, but I promise I won't do you wrong
Keep you away from harm, my love is protected
I'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected
I'll just make you aware of what we have is rare
In the moment of despair, I'm the courage when you're scared
Loyal, down for you, soon as I saw you
Wanted to be there cause I could hold it down for you
Be around for you, plant seeds in the soil
Make love all night, bending bed coils
You're a queen, therefore I treat you royal
This is all for you, cause I simply adore you

[Verse 1: Meg Donnelly & Milo Manheim, Both]
I know it might be crazy
But did you hear the story?
I think I heard it vaguely
A girl and a zombie
Oh, tell me more, boy
Yeah
Sounds like a fantasy
Oh, what could go so wrong
With a girl and a zombie
You're from the perfect paradise
And I'm living on the darker side
Ooh, I've got a feeling
If you get to know me
Right from the start you caught my eye
And something inside me came to life
Ooh, I've got a feeling
If you get to know me

Someday
This could be, this could be ordinary
Someday
Could we be something extraordinary?
You and me side by side

We're gonna be someday
We're gonna be someday
Someday, someday
We're gonna be someday

Girl, you look delicious
Oh, I mean gorgeous
Well, now you're getting fearless
No, I'm just rooting for us
If different was a super power
We'd be so flawless
Yeah, we could make these two worlds ours
I'm rooting for us
Two lonely hearts meet in the dark
Imagine it now they start a spark
You got my attention
What happens next, then?
Movies and long walks in the park
Hanging out anywhere we want
I like the way you're thinking
I can almost see it

[Chorus: Meg Donnelly & Milo Manheim, Both]
Someday
This could be, this could be ordinary

She says, ""Where have you been?""

To be waiting for what is mine
To be hating what I am

Want a love that is based on truth, not just dare

So don't just say things that I've already heard
Don't want your body without your soul

If right now you decide
That you are not ready to settle down

These times are trouble
And these times are good
There always gonna be
They rise and they fall
We take them all the way that we should
Together you and me
Forsaking them all

Deep in the night
And by the light of day
It always looks the same
True love always does
Here by your side or a million miles away
Nothin' is ever gonna change the way I feel
The way it is, is the way that it was

Chorus:
When I said I do, I meant that I will
Til' the end of all time
Be faithful and true, devoted to you
That's what I had in mind, when I said I do

Well this whole world keeps changin'
And the world stays the same
For all who came before
And it goes hand in hand

Only you and I can undo
All that we became
That makes us so much more (so much more)
Than a woman and a man

After everything
That comes and goes around
Has only passed us by
Here alone in our dreams

I know there's a lonely heart
In every lost and found
But forever you and I will be the ones
Who found out what forever means

You know that I'll always be there for you

45,What Do You Say,"What do you say when your too fucked up
Whatcha your girlfriend say when I smack that butt
What do you say when ya run outta drugs
And baby whatcha say when you bust a nut

LL.Cool J needed love like
Dirt nasty need some drugs like
My baby dick needs a tug like right now
So hop that ass in the bath tub
What do I do when im too fucked up
Can't keep it up cause her boob job sucks
And what does she do when I whip it out
Close her eyes and open her mouth
I think I need a intervention
C-c-c-coke ,dope ,weed ,and then perscription
So listen up little children
Dirt diggler you be illin'
Im feelin kinda drowsy
Dont do drugs without me

What do you say when your too fucked up
Whatcha girlfriend say when I smack that butt
What do you say when you run outta drugs
And baby whatcha say when you bust a nut

Whatcha gonna do when you get too faded
And the date you with wanna get X rated
Andre legacy I stay sedated
Put me in the wheel chair and get me on the plane bitch
F-f-f-famous for bein opiated
Up in this club I fell asleep on the table
Tip the waitress pinch the ass
I gave her my number
The kid's got panache, lick on my stash
It ain't that easy livin this fast

Forget to pass corn beef and hash
Horny little bitches like to call me their dad
It ain't that bad put my dick in they mouth
And my nose in they coke bag

What do you say when your too fucked up
Whatcha girlfriend say when I smack that butt
What do you say when you run outta drugs
And baby whatcha say when you bust a nut

What im gonna do when im all washed up
And that bitch that I like to fuck with won't come
I could try my luck with a penis pump
Go get me some intravenous love
Birds and bees and worms and slugs
Turn to me or turn to drugs
Word on the street is I stink like a bum
But its hard to take a shower when ya can't wake up
What do I do when there ain't none left
Make a call to the pony express
Garuntee 40 minutes or less
Costs a bit more but only bring the best
Ever seen a bitch in the brand new dress
With a fat old man tryin to look all fresh
Well i've been with the worst and the best
And I could n't even tell the difference

What do you say when your too fucked up
Whatcha girlfriend say when I smack that butt
What do you say when you run outta drugs
And baby whatcha say when ya bust a nut

What do you say when your too fucked up
Whatcha girlfriend say when I smack that butt",Mickey Avalon,1999,"[46, 51, 56, 63, 69, 71, 71, 76, 88]",9
46,The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire),"[Verse 1: Ariana, Elizabeth]
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows
A turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

[Chorus: Ariana, Elizabeth, Both]
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly-y

To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said, many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

I would give up everything
Before I'd separate myself from you

I was all by myself for the longest time
So cold inside
And the hurt from the heartache would not subside
I felt like dying
Until you saved my life

When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life

I will give you everything
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

I'll be alright

See, I was so desolate before you came to me
Looking back
I guess it shows that we were destined
To shine over the rain, to appreciate
The gift of what we have
And I'd go through it all over again
To be able to feel
This way

[Chorus: 98¬∞ with ad-libs from Mariah Carey & Joe]
Thank God I found you

Sometimes love goes from sunshine to rain
I'm under this umbrella and I'm calling your name

And you know I don't wanna lose that, cause I still believe

I still believe in love, I still believe in us
I hope you believe in us, the way I believe in us, you don't see
Cause what you don't see is when we don't speak I really don't sleep, I wanna talk to you
And if I'd have the world in my hands I'd give it all to ya
I wanna know if you feeling, the way that I'm feeling

All the many days you were on my mind
Visions of me with you all the time
I do whatever puts a smile on my baby's face
My best friend and you can never be replaced

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Yuh, yo
I'm on that homicide, suicide, drama like Islamabad
Under God, goin' overboard like the Amistad
Ringin' bells, it was 2012 back in ‚Äò95
I made it out alive, now, finally, I've arrived
But still threw back to all my other blue black
People that's stickin' to it like mice to a glue trap
My work speak for itself, so I don't interrupt
I am an expert, this is no beginner's luck
If you denyin' the truth, then I don't give a fuck
Otherwise, get your hands and your antennas up
As we go into our initial decent, I'm alive, but only fifty percent
I‚Äôm prayin' God give me the strength

[Chorus: Main Event West]
It‚Äôs like somebody turned on the light (Turned on the light)
It‚Äôs like somebody started a fire and I feel so alive
Finally, I‚Äôve realized that I don't have to tell myself twice
I know that you've changed my whole life
And if I know there‚Äôs one thing that‚Äôs the truth
I know I‚Äôd be lost if I lost you

What am I gonna do?
(Here in my life, just you and I)
My best friend and you can never be replaced

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
They say tomorrow‚Äôs not promised today
But today I promise if we don‚Äôt make our own way, somebody‚Äôll take it from us
Snatch it like rats to cheese
So, Lord, help me please 'cause I rather die on my feet than to live on my knees
Living like I‚Äôm bulletproof
Cockin' the Glock and aim and shoot
My future‚Äôs ever clear, a 180 proof
So I open the bottle then swallow my pride and drink the pain away
I take shots and just lay up then fade away
Dreamin' of better days, dreamin' of better pay
But we got our work cut out for us, so we better pray
Pray to uphold the weak, not for eternal sleep
But if I die, I pray the Lord my soul to keep

[Chorus: Main Event West]
It‚Äôs like somebody turned on the light (Turned on the light)
It‚Äôs like somebody started a fire and I feel so alive
Finally, I‚Äôve realized that I don't have to tell myself twice

And if I know there‚Äôs one thing that‚Äôs the truth

From a woman who said she was through and calmly walked away
I tried to smile, and did a while; but it felt so outta place
Did you ever hear of a clown with tear drops streaming down his face?

[Chorus]
Pop a top, again
I think I'll have another round
Set em' up my friend
Then I'll be gone and you can let some other fool sit down

[Verse 2]
Home for me, is misery, and here I'm wasting time
Cause a row of fools on a row of stools is not what's on my mind
But then you see her leaving me. It's not what I perfer
So, it's either here just drinking beer or at home remembering her

Pop a top, again

[Verse 3: Will Smith]
I remember trying to count how old I'd be
When the clock struck twelve in the year 2G
Medianoche finally near
This will be that anthem amongst the cheers
Just the man to usher it in
Big Will bringing the heat
K-Ci bringing the plan
Ringing it in, waiting for the ball to drop
That 2000 vault we breaking the lock
Let hip-hop keep blazing the charts
May the past keep a warm spot in your heart
May the future hold more joy then pain
Hands in the air waiting for confetti to rain

[K-Ci:]
Its here and I like it
Gonna pack the dance floor
Rock the dance floor
Here it comes another year
Come on everyone, new millennium
Here it comes another year
Everyone, new millennium

[Bridge: Will Smith]
There's a party tonight
Everybody was drinking
The house was screaming
And the bass was shaking
And it won't be long
Till everybody knowing at twelve o'clock
At 12 o'clock
Say what? Say what? Say what? What?

[K-Ci:]
Here it comes another year
Come on everyone, new millennium
Here it comes another year

While my lil' B.G.'s on the bus puttin' out cigarette butts
But me, personally, playboy I don't give a fuck
And I'mma always show love to my cut
Hit the club, light the bitch up
The Cash Money motto is to drink 'til we throw up
Nigga point the ho out, guaranteed I can fuck
Woadie, I'm tattooed and balled up
Medallion iced up, Rolex bezelled up
And my pinky ring is platinum plus
Earrings be trillion cut and my grill be slugged up
My heart filled with anger cause nigga I don't give a fuck
Stack my cheese up, cause one day I'ma give this street life up
Beef I don't discuss, a nigga outta line gon' get his motherfuckin' head bust
Cash Money Millionaires plus
Don't touch sum'in nigga you can't fuck
Twenty inches TV is a must
By the year two thousand I'm gut out my bus

[Verse 2: Lil' Turk]
A lil' nigga seventeen playin' with six figures
Got so much ice you can skate on a nigga
When you see Cash Money you know we stay flossin'
Catch ya girl down bad ya know we straight tossin'
I ain't seen a clique yet that can stunt like mine
I ain't seen a Maro that can run like mine
1999, and it's our turn to shine
Fifty or better on our wrist and they all blind
Pourin' vodka 'til I die drank 'til I faint
'Til a nigga tell me I need another drank
My nigga Baby told me work nigga trick to them hoes
Nigga Baby told me work nigga better than treatin' yo nose
I'm the freak of the clique
Keep it on the tuck
So I creep on a bitch and I play it the raw
Never sleep with a bitch, keep it real with my niggas
Never weep for a bitch, never weep for a bitch nigga

But I break you know I'm sayin' so
This is how it goes, damn

[Verse 1]
Last year, Valentine's Day
You would just warmly say
""Babe I love you, love you, babe I swear""
Held you when you were sick, even...
The whole time I'd think to myself
This isn't fair

[Pre-Chorus]
What is this I see? (NO)
You don't come home to me (oh no)
When you don't come home to me (man)
Can't deal, can't bear
You keep tellin' me lies

Look, I found her red coat and you're (bitch)
Caught out there!

[Verse 2]
So sick of your games
I'll set your truck to flames
And watch it blow up, blow up, tell me
How you gonna see her now?
So far from sincere
Fabrications in my ear
Drive me so far up the wall, I come slidin' down

[Pre-Chorus]
What is this I see (I don't believe this)
You don't come home to me
When you don't come home to me
I can't deal, can't bear (I won't)

She's so raunchy, so vulgar
Not me, why the hell her?
Look she dresses, a mess (Look at her)
What do you see? (I don't know)
It's not all about cash (hell no)
Nor how much you flash
How I dress is a reflection of me

[Pre-Chorus]
What is this I see
You don't come home to me
When you don't come home to me
Can't deal, can't bear (told you I won't)
You keep tellin' me lies
But to your surprise
Look I got something for y'all since you're
Caught out there

64,Something Like That,"[Intro: Dr. Dre and MC Ren]
Ah yeah, yo Ren, yo ready to do this shit?
Yeah, Dre, let's rip shit up
Hey yo, Yella Boy, why don't you kick me one of them funky ass beats?
Yo, we got my homeboy Eazy E in the house
Yeah, Compton's definitely in the house
Yo Ren, what we gonna call this shit? Tell 'em what yo name is
Yeah something like that
Alright, let's kick this shit on the one
Kick it

[Verse 1: MC Ren and Dr. Dre]
Back by demand, now it's big as fuck
Because you as the public, you should know what's up
""Compton's in the House"" was more than gold, it was a hit
Cause it was based on some crazy shit
So our final conclusion has been permitted
Punks made us a target and knew that we'd hit it
But that was a part of showbiz
Hey yo, homeboy, why don't you tell 'em what your name is

[Verse 2: MC Ren and Dr. Dre]
Well for the record it's Ren, and for the street it's villain
And strapped with a gat, it's more like Matt Dillon
On ""Gunsmoke"", but not a man of the law
I'm just the baddest motherfucker that you ever saw
See, I peep and then I creep on a fool
Get my blood pressure high, but still stay cool
Dig a grave of a nigga lookin' up to me
That really had the nerve that he could fuck with me
Who was the man in the mask, while I was waitin' to ask
You know, it's MC Ren kickin' mucho ass
Gettin' respect in showbiz
Hey yo homeboy, what's up?
Why don't you tell 'em what your name is?

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
Dre, the motherfuckin' doctor, bitch hopper
The sucker-motherfucker stopper
Back with a vocal track that's a fresh one
So now, let's get the motherfuckin' session
Goin', flowin'. It's time to start throwin' - rhymes
So keep in mind all the suckers I'm blowin'
Cause I'm a start showin' the time
Never sayin' I'm the best and just goin' for mine
Unlike a lotta suckers who claim they're gettin' busy
When their records only make good frisbees
You need to quit runnin' off the mouth
Stop and think before you put some whack bullshit out
It's not difficult, in fact it's kinda simple
To create something funky that's original
You either talkin' 'bout the place to be
Who you are, what you got, or about a sucker MC

[Interlude: Dr. Dre and MC Ren]
Oh yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about, Ren
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, I know what you're sayin', Dre, but you still ain't told 'em enough, man
Alright, alright
Well, let's kick one more verse right here, alright
Kick it

[Verse 4: MC Ren & Dr. Dre]
This is portable, something to fuck with yo ear
Ren and Dre will appear when the sound is clear
To fuck it up like we always do, and that's the trick
Sayin' some shit to make the bitches wanna suck our dicks
But it's an everyday thang
Communicating to y'all with the Compton slang
Compton's back in the house and your appartment
So open your door, by the way, so we can start it
Test the monitors and call this mic
Cause the way we feel, we're gonna fuck it up tonight
I got my mic in my hand, with a hell of a grip
Bitches screamin' and shit, now it's a trip
Waitin' for the grand finale, or the end
Or stupid rhymes set by Dre and Ren
Well, like a kid, we get new shoes and go faster
Smilin', like hell, as we move past the
Suckers, the motherfuckers with the ego hype
Well we're positive and they're on a negative type
And if think we're about to quit...
Motherfucker you ain't heard shit

[Dre]
Yeah, that shit was funky, you know what I'm sayin', Ren ?
[Ren]
I know what you're sayin', this is MC Ren and Dr.Dre
Cold kickin' it in the place
[Dre]
Ah yeah, my mellow Eazy E in the house
Yella Boy in the house
My boy Ice Cube
Arabian Prince cold rockin' shit
[Ren]
Oh yeah, hey, I'm a say whassup to my homeboys from CMW
[Dre]
Yeah, hey, yo Ren, whatta we gonna call this shit?
""Tell'em what yo name is?""

[Verse 1]
This nigga lookin' like love
No doubt sophisticated thug keep me guessin'
Said it would be a blessin' just to watch you undressin'
Callin' you daddy, late nights I'm layin' on your chest and
Stay reminiscin' 'bout the rest and, and how they less than
Tryna come between what we share, can't compare (Never)
Could have been left, but when it's mine, I never share
Fight to the death if need be to prove that
Wounds from your wars, other bitches couldn't soothe that
Broke from a bad back, I'm holdin' you down
Doin' dirt with other bitches but them other fishes drown
Locked in, for however long, I'm playin' it smart
Court dates in other cities, there, I'm playin' my part
Wifey, in ya life see forever be us
Passenger side of a Bentley or the number 2 bus
Tell the whole world, papi, Eve don't want nobody else
With other niggas pick and choose, but you, I'm keepin' for myself

[Chorus]
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him

[Verse 2]
All my peoples thinkin' I'm delirious, but the love I feel is serious
Couples of the world, no comparing us
Been through fist fights with niggas when I see it escalate
I'm the getaway driver, so my nigga can escape
Pull my ice for the bail, spending nights in jail
Drawing hearts on the wall with our names around the cell
It may be a little craziness, maybe I'm blind
But for me to leave now, lookin' for love would take a lifetime
So I'm keepin' mine, fuckin' keep me blind
Feels like heaven when we makin' love, controllin' my spine
Wine and dine, I don't need that as long as long as you with me
And you bitches thinkin' that you competition, come and get me
My position is held, some try and all fail
Pussy piece a mothafucka, uh-huh, good enough to sell
Never leave his baby girl, mad 'cause he claim me
Only thug in the hood that was wild enough to tame me (C'mon)

[Chorus]
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him (Yeah)
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him (Yeah)

[Verse 3]
I'm the bitch he'll never leave, helped him build his luxuries
Carry stories that can hurt him, still he only trustin' me
Secrets never leave my mouth, even if they torture me
Always taught to hold the ground, that's why I'll always be his queen
Did some dumb shit, see him in the party, start to flip
Curse him out on the regular just to make him sick
Disappear for a day or two to test his loyal ground
Keep my dogs on a short leash, controllin' the growl
Open wide, I don't give a fuck, I'm swallowin' my pride
And he fast to blast a cat that he think be on the prowl
But I'll never let him go, temper flare, let it go
Always be his extra back bone, quick to let a nigga know
Always by his side, Eve the apple in his eye
Us together ain't no stopping snatchin' pieces of the pie
Us together in our own world, what's his becomes mine
Exceed eternity with him we'll stand the test of time (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever

I ain't seen my lady in days, I been out on these streets so long
Late night to the early morn, I been such a rolling stone
And I just wanna make it home (make it home)
To you (to you, to you, to you)
Blinded by all these street lights, up late, can't sleep nights
My stomach growling, I ain't eating right, my mind gone, I ain't thinking right
I ain't tryna just be getting by, don't want a slice, I want the pie
American dreaming, days of a heathen running up in your building at night
Masked up, this ain't trick or treat, one wrong move they finna squeeze
We ain't come for peace, you can bend your knees and pray all day
They waiting on me to give an a-okay, then the K gon' spray
But today's your day, I'mma let you live, I'mma let you pay
Back everything you ever said to me so start with the thing that you said to me

I'm a motherfuckin' roamer! Stoned up
Feeling like I'm in a coma, hold up
I got some money I should tend to, gotta get to it
I don't mean to Matthew Kemp you, but shit you
Ain't heard a nigga thorough, it ain't perfect, but I work
And that purple that I got got me on slur with all my words
Thats my word, thats my boy too, yall dont really know what Ive gone through
Now me, Stalley, and Meek wanna see Ross get the A-Rod loot
Big play, hot juice, Drama called and you're Carl Lewis
My opponents so obtuse, even if they alone they not top two
I'm in Ohio watching Kyrie and Samardo hoopin'
Work loud, chokin', all your reefer, it's soft spoken

It's not hot that you be calling me, stressing me
Paging my beeper you're just non-stop
And it's not hot that you be leaving me messages

But it was game you had me fooled
Cause 20 minutes after I gave you my number
You already had my mailbox full

So what, you bought a pair of shoes

Open up a throttle and stir a little dust
Just look at her face she ain‚Äôt a fooling me

We ride back and forth 'til we run out of light
Take it to the barn put it up for the night
Climb up in the loft sit and talk with the radio on

She wants a little farm and a yard full of kids
One more teeny weenie ride before take her home

Who could be the boss? Look up to the cross
Stranded in the land of the lost
Standin' up, I'm sideways
I'm blazin' up the path, runnin' on the highways of rap
Choked up by the smoke and the charcoal
A lotta stamps and brands, we like a bar code
I'm bashin' all the media strikes to keep the media dykes
As reinforcement for the fight
And that alone'll keep John Gotti on the phone
I'm tangled in the zone, I got the bees on the track
Where the fuck you at? (Tical!)
Let me hear you pigeons run ya mouth now (Shut the fuck up!)
I'm pluggin' in them social skills that keep my total bills
Over a million the last time I checked it
Thank God, I'm blessed with a mind that'll wreck it
Wait until the second round and knock 'em out

They call me Big John Studd, my middle name Mud
Dirty water flow, too much for you thug
They can't stand the flood ‚Äì what up, doc?
Hold big gun like Elmer Fudd,  the sureshot
Mr. Meth I'm unplugged (learn!)
Temperatures too hot for sunblock (burn!)
Playin' wit' minds that get you state time
Locked behind 12 bars from a great mind
Killa bees in the club wit' this ladybug
Brought a sword to the dance floor to cut a rug
Love is love all day, til' they throw slugs
And take another life in cold blood, can't feel me 'til its your blood
Murder rates tremendous, crime is endless
Same shit different day, Father forgive us
They know not what they do, all praise is due
I'm big like E-Z and Big Bambu

Comin' through your stereo, why risk it?
Lifestyles of the prolific and gifted
Eight essential vitamins and minerals, delicious
Word on the street is, they bit my thesis
Knocked out they front teefes, tryin' to taste mine
Actin' like they heard it through the grapevine
Dope fiendin' for the bassline, to provide rhyme
Pharmaceuticals, hard as nails to the cuticles

Kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, and then jet

Maybe we can meet up on the sun
Discretion is advised for the blood of virgin eyes
We limpin' on the track with the Method
So get the sunblock, you gettin' one-shot
Until you dissolve, I revolve around everything you got
From outta nowhere, prepare, you be blinded by the glare
I told you not to stare, now you're turned into stone
Without a microphone, but don't you forget you're in a zone
So shut the fuck up, and take that shit back
'Cause all your shit's wack (Doo doo is doo doo)
When its weighed out like that

78,The Great Beyond,"[Verse 1]
I've watched the stars fall silent from your eyes
All the sights that I have seen
I can't believe that I believed
I wished that you could see
There's a new planet in the solar system
There is nothing up my sleeve

[Hook]
I'm pushing an elephant up the stairs
I'm tossing up punch lines that were never there
Over my shoulder a piano falls
Crashing to the ground

[Verse 2]
In all this talk of time, talk is fine
But I don't want to stay around
Why can't we pantomime
Just close our eyes and sleep sweet dreams
Me and you with wings on our feet

[Hook]
I'm pushing an elephant up the stairs
I'm tossing up punch lines that were never there
Over my shoulder a piano falls
Crashing to the ground

[Chorus]
I'm breaking through, I'm bending spoons
I'm keeping flowers in full bloom
I'm looking for answers from the great beyond

[Verse 3]
I want the humming birds, the dancing bears
Sweetest dreams of you
I look into the stars
I look into the moon

I'm pushing an elephant up the stairs

Good morn' or evening, friends
Smile, you recordin'?

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Slammin' Bentley doors like we invented doors
20 years ago we drove Bentley Azures
We drinkin' Cristal then
Yeah, kept the tray on me like Chris Paul then
Drinkin' Ace of Spades like it's codeine now
Tryna put a million on the whole team now
Push through the pain so we can see new life
So all the ladies havin' babies, see ya sacrifice
Mama had four kids, but she's a lesbian
Had to pretend so long that she's a thespian
Had to hide in the closet, so she medicate
Society shame and the pain was too much to take
Cried tears of joy when you fell in love
Don't matter to me if it's a him or her
I just wanna see you smile through all the hate
Marie Antoinette, baby, let 'em eat cake

[Chorus: JAY-Z & Stevie Wonder]
Bad times turn to good memories, smile
Even when I'm gone and you remember me, smile
Good times never fade away, smile
Even if I'm not with you here today, smile
Good morn' or evening, friends

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Far as draft picks, my name did not get called
Bet before I go I put a billion on the board
Hall of Fame Hov, I did it all without a pen
Y'all knew that was comin', I had to remind y'all again, huh?
Flyin' paper planes through the projects
Now the whole projects on my jet
Now you see the real in the front row
In every one of y'all televised shows
Super facts
Niggas switched sides, traded pride, we don't do all that
A loss ain't a loss, it's a lesson
Appreciate the pain, it‚Äôs a blessin'

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
I mastered my aesthetics
I know you often heard me wax poetic
'Bout bein' back in the Lexus
But trust me, that was nothin', a nigga up in
The hundreds of millions, I have no ceilings
Ah, this that feelin', I'm that boy
Anita Baker's ""You Bring Me Joy"" slappin' out of the toy
The separation is clear in my rear-view mirror
Objects is further than they appear
Oh yeah, I was born with a pair, playin' for high stakes
Norman's Cay, he looked up and out of the Lear
How niggas can't relate?
Fuck a slice of the apple pie, want my own cake
In charge of my own fate, respect Jimmy Iovine
But he gotta respect the Elohim as a whole new regime
And niggas playin' for power, huh
So our music is ours, niggas own their own houses
Ours was, ""Fuck you, pay me""
Now it's, ""Fuck payin' me, I pay you
Put the rest away for Blue""
That blood money I giggle at it
Can't even support my miss' habit
Jewelry shoppin' in Pa- all ya jewelers should be embarrassed
Huh, blood diamonds drippin' with guilt, I still ain't trippin'
That's life, winners and losers
Drug dealers and abusers, America likes me ruthless
My therapist said I relapsed
I said, ""Pre-haps I Freudian slipped in European whips""
God sent me to break the chain, I'm the true and livin'
God in the flesh, the rest of these niggas is vain
A stain on the white suit, inferior IQ
Niggas'll rip your shit off TIDAL just to spite you
Ahhhh, what did I do? 'Cept try to free you
Niggas'll love you but hate you 'cause they can't be you
Dump 'em all in the bayou, uh
Everybody wave bye to the guy you thought you could lie to
This was meant to be a haiku, huh
But my story's too wide to fit inside the line or two
Oh, these that drugs, heron flow, I spaz on the stove
This is Hov, no flex zone, nigga, who lied to you?
Look, you a pedestrian, don't ever question the security I provided you
Oh y'all thought I was washed? I'm at the cleaners
Launderin' dirty money like the Teamsters, huh
Shout out to Hoffa back home, he in the church
When I heard you got booked, that shit hurt
Feel for you bro, we know the system don't work
Take a young nigga freedom over some dirt
Yet it's legal in Colorado, yet, we deny
Black entrepreneurs, free enterprise
That's why it's a black market, that's why it's called the trap
That's why it's called the projects 'cause it's exactly that
All these people was gon' kill me, heh
'Cause the more I reveal me, the more they 'fraid of the real me
Welcome back Carter, smile

[Outro: Gloria Carter]
Living in the shadow
Can you imagine what kind of life it is to live?
In the shadows people see you as happy and free
Because that's what you want them to see
Living two lives, happy, but not free
You live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or the person you love
The world is changing and they say it's time to be free
But you live with the fear of just being me
Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be
No harm for them, no harm for me
But life is short, and it's time to be free
Love who you love, because life isn't guaranteed

86,Guerrilla Radio,"[Verse 1]
Transmission, third World War, third round
A decade of the weapon of sound above ground
No shelter if you're looking for shade
I lick shots at the brutal charade
As the polls close like a casket, on truth devoured
A silent play on the shadow of power
A spectacle monopolized
The camera's eyes on choice disguised
Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil?
Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?
Yes, a spectacle monopolized
They hold the reins, stole your eyes
All the Fistagons, the bullets, and bombs
Who stuff the banks, who staff the party ranks
More for Gore, or the son of a drug lord
None of the above, fuck it, cut the cord!

[Chorus]
Lights out, guerrilla radio!
Turn that shit up!
Lights out, guerrilla radio!
Turn that shit up!
Lights out, guerrilla radio!
Turn that shit up!
Lights out, guerrilla radio!

[Verse 2]
Contact, I hijacked the frequencies
Blockin' the beltway, move on DC!
Way past the days of bombin' MCs'
Sound off, Mumia go on be free!
Who got 'em? Yo, check the federal file
All you pendejos know the trial was vile
An army of pigs try to silence my style
Off 'em all out that box, it's my radio dial!

[Chorus]
Lights out, guerrilla radio!
Turn that shit up!
Lights out, guerrilla radio!
Turn that shit up!
Lights out, guerrilla radio!
Turn that shit up!

87,Notorious B.I.G.,"[Intro: The Notorious B.I.G.]
(""Fuck all you hoes!"" Get a grip, motherfucker!)
Yeah, this album is dedicated
To all the teachers that told me I'd never amount to nothin'
To all the people that lived above the buildings that I was hustlin' in front of
Called the police on me when I was just tryin' to make some money to feed my daughter (it's all good)
And all the niggas in the struggle
You know what I'm sayin'? It's all good, baby baby

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed in Bamb√∫, sippin' on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number, same hood, it's all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

[Chorus: Total & Puff Daddy]
You know very well (Yeah)
Who you are (Money, hoes and clothes)
Don't let 'em hold you down (Bankrolls, yeah, haha)
Reach for the stars (It's all good)
You had a goal (C'mon)
But not that many (It's all good)
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty (Check it)

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach
And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
The Mo√´t and Aliz√© keep me pissy, girls used to diss me
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rapping stuff
I was too used to packing gats and stuff
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the East Coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Living life without fear
Puttin' five karats in my baby girl ear
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

[Chorus: Total & Puff Daddy]
You know very well (C'mon)
Who you are (Bankrolls)
Don't let 'em hold you down (Clothes)
Reach for the stars (Mansions)
You had a goal
But not that many (It's all good)
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty ('94)

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
When I was dead broke, man, I couldn't picture this
50-inch screen, money-green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is loungin'
Celebrating every day, no more public housin'
Thinkin' back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps an Ac' with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip Champagne when we thirsty
Uh, damn right I like the life I live
'Cause I went from negative to positive and it's all (It's all good, nigga)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

[Chorus: Total, The Notorious B.I.G. & Puff Daddy]
You know very well (Money)
Who you are (Hoes and clothes)
Don't let 'em hold you down (Bankrolls)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
Reach for the stars (That's right)
You had a goal (It's all good)
But not that many (All good)
'Cause you're the only one (East coast, represent)
I'll give you good and plenty (C'mon)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

Representin' B-Town in the house (Biggie Smalls)

Then you know it was meant to be (meant to be), meant to be

97,Still D.R.E.,"[Produced by Dr. Dre, Scott Storch and Mel-Man]

[Intro: Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre]
Yeah, nigga, we're still fuckin' with you
Still waters run deep
Still Snoop Dogg and D.R.E.
'99, nigga,  guess who's back
Still, still doin' that shit Andre?
Oh for sho'
Yeah
Check me out

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg]
It's still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
‚ÄòCause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How? Nigga, my last album was The Chronic
They wanna know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they wanna know how I feel about it
(If you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still puffin' my leaves, still fuck with the beats
Still not lovin' police (Uh-uh)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (For sho')
Still got love for the streets, reppin' 213 (For life)
Still the beats bang, still doin' my thang
Since I left ain't too much changed, still

[Hook: Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre]
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them lo-los, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dippin' again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doin' 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali weed: I smoke 'til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire 'til you're soakin' in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since ""Turn Off the Lights"" from the World Class Wreckin Cru
I'm still at it, after mathematics
In the home of drive-bys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through, then I get skin, D.R.E.

[Hook: Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre]
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world

And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg]
It ain't nothin' but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether you're coolin' on the corner with your fly bitch
Laid back in the shack, play this track
I'm representin' for the gangstas all across the world
Still (Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king, but the ace is back
(So if you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre be the name, still runnin' the game
Still got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't trippin', love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more livin' hard
Barbeques every day, drivin' fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless (Still)

[Hook: Snoop Dogg (& Dr. Dre)]
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world

Yo, alot of people be steppin to us like
Y'all from San Francisco right?
Nah G we show alot of love
For the state of California from Humboldt to Oceanside ya dig
But L.A. is where it all happens for the Dub and Thes One
All you MC's say L.A. when you on stage
And when you do spit that hot verse
We gonna make it happen man

[Verse One: Double K]
Who wanna test?
We lickin' off shots in the west
We make believers out the best
Lay the weak to rest
In southern Californ' now ain't no place like this
Half the stuff y'all doin' we created this shit
So don't be saggin young buck in the presence of this
Don't even come from the city and you runnin your lip
I'm 'bout to make a call get the news van out
Explain to Tritia Toyota on how your crew ran out
We comin live from the trey two three area code
Mad clouds of smoke and ain't no room for snow
Ah, sucka niggas with sucka beats
Stay in the back seat and buckle up for the ride
I'm chillin with bad guys
And got time on my side
Cause this is my city this is where I live
And if ya bring bad vibes I got something to give
Hangin out under the sun is an everyday thang
And gettin crazy in the labs the only way I bang
Don't step to me with that mean face
Buddy I'm all smiles and I'm countin the miles
Down Crescent Heights boulevard
Home of the stars
Get ya pulled out ya car for frontin' too hard
Just listen, you ain't down with the streets my brotha?
I can forsee in your future there's some runnin for cover
Alot of y'all talk a good game
But ain't playin
I learned about the hood and now a field is where your stayin
Fools be givin you the mad dog after the show
Cause we ain't feelin them flows
Or your designer clothes
There's phony people in L.A. I counted its alot
And if they ain't a snitch or a bullin', they're claimin your block
Just get it right its Crescent Heights, all day, all night
The community where I was raised
Livin my days
Wishin I could be the mayor i'd deport you fools
And send you back to squareland cause over here we rule?
Authentic people in the town
Throw up your dub take a drag
It's Double K signin off from the home of the bodybags

[Verse Two: Thes One]
Now about five years after they kill Creeper
The hot Wrestling move was the sleeper
Drug dealers rock beepers
T tops, jerry curls, jelly flip flops for girls
C.B.'s on the strip and a commercial for World on Wheels I whistle to my crew up on the block
The COLORS soundtrack rocked the Fatburger jukebox
My L.A. U.S.C. memories are emery sticks who filed down clowns
Claimin the same tricks on this turf
My roots go deep like turbo Nerf
And the cops still sweat us
I roll on all blocks like I'm sellin paletas
And rock the bells
Home of the drive-by where they pop the shells
I eat at Chano's and La Barca, not Taco Bell
And if you're not from the city then you should probably bail
Cause alot of cats are implants
Claimin L.A with something to say and something to prove in
At the shows with the flows and they think the crowd's groovin
Its like the 405 at 5:30 nobodys movin
I'm tired of non-recognition losin the mission to proven to cats
That my soundtracks and L.A. hat
When newjacks jock New York rap on a block
With a palm tree it makes me sick
All you underground producers get off Premier's dick and just (chill)
I'm headed back to Pedro to sit up on the hill
Next to the Korean bell eatin Busy Bee
Watchin waves swell high visibility Catalina and sail boats
Hollywood hip hop soaps and sit-com dreams
I make morphine for beat fiends
Support L.A. teens stay trippin with Cal Green
O.G. Jerry Duffey when I'm on your screen
I'm friends with neighborhood crack heads
And I know (?Ben?)
L.A. is the place where I solve my problems
In it i'll never fear
I'll always stay here
Cause when I'm in L.A. my family's there

While you listening to the words that I wrote on the disc

AK is my heat, everyday in the street 'til I lay six feet
QB, PJs, and we playing for keeps
Jewelry, cars and Jeeps is my motto
Four-fives with the hollows, silencers on the nozzles
Pop bottles with those who left here

The aim for the head and chest years

Let Nastradamus tell us what time it is
I was the first one on that Don shit
First nigga to sing a hook on some TJ Swan shit
Black ski masks up in the projects, camoulflage, full clips
Run up in your crib, tie up your bitch
Weigh the bricks and we loco, so broke, brown coke won't sell
Spending your money on weed, smoke and hotels
Hood rats and bullet wound up females
Got babies by hustlers and niggas in jail
Slinging for chips and fiends with burnt finger tips
Base heads, killed cab drivers just for a hit
A week later, sporting Gators, getting thrills
Our honies wearing Gucci high heels
She come to scoop me, I chill
Leave the streets alone for a sec
Hit the sky bar on sunset, then the sex is so high-tech

But where you at now, you lamp, laid and max now
Where Bravehearts put they rap down in honor of your name, you a legend
And they don't understand how you CEO from heaven
But that's another level, brethren
Two G's, we got the type fam with MAC-11's
We do squeeze, thought it's not right
But that's the zone that we left in
Bentleys, Porches, Piaget watches
Sick with the bread, Lamborghini trucks topless
Laptops with 100 gigabytes, ninja bikes
And we all roll dice, for each other's ice
And how does one guy multiply to more than five wise guys?
But only one man, only the mind's eye can understand that I'm...

I'll put a gun to those cocksuckers, fuck them in the ass
Oh god, I sound like a gay boy who has just lost his fuckin' sex toy to fuck his married partner who as a big hairy torso and a cut foreskin, being gay is a god damn sin, what am I saying
I sin too, I fuck minds, kick and kill people who are kind
I hate very nice people, we all should be bad
I'm so glad, I have a plan to kill my ex girlfriends dad
Fuck this, I'm a downright asshole
Yeah, fuck my life sometimes cause I just don't know what to do
I just have a mind of a sinner so please kill my ex girlfriend so I can bin her
I will not do it in the damn winter, maybe in the summer
Life is a bummer and she didn't even let me bum her
[Chorus]
A wire sparks faster than a fire flame
I get so bored more so I need more fame
I can't even find shit, I can only find my own toxic spit
I have a genie in a bottle and that's it
I have a genie in a bottle, not coming out to grant my wish
[Verse 2]
I rarely find reasons to say, I just can't find anything to do
I sometimes want to sit down and sniff some glue
I might die from it, dying from that shit is like dying from a hit by the most strongest cunt in the whole damn world
Twirl in circles and then fall from dizyness, not a moment to miss
Running away from bullies back at school, never wanted to compete in things
If I did anyway, the kids would just pick on me
Even if the teacher is here, she would bully me too
I would just put a bomb on it, theifs going in more than a day to break in and steal shit, a camera too
Maybe there was a reason, gotta do what you gotta do
I would break in too, if I could
I would and I will, maybe after it I might take a E pill
I'm easin' still, breezin' and the drug ready to kill

A wire sparks faster than a fire flame
I get so bored more so I need more fame
I can't even find shit, I can only find my own toxic spit

Droppin' dope and sick beats in my bedroom, my father shouting at me to turn the shit down
Lower the sound and rap lower like I am wispering the lyrics
Checkin' my YouTube statics, SoundCloud and my Myspace
I'm pacin, shit I'm racin' a fucker and ready to fall flat on my face
I joined the am and I just thank myself and them
I've got a tool to boost my shit, my music
I keep losin' shit and I hate it, fuck it
I'm beginning to turn mad, not weird but bad
I think I might just go damn funny, I have a sore tummy
I got a fever ready to dance and I am not a believer
My girlfriend tellin' me lies a lot so it has to take a lot for me to believe her
I'm a god damn downright dick, I just can't listen to Burnsyboy without bein' and feelin' damn sick
I'm a sick slick, Burnsyboy will die
Fuck him, he has no wonder why
Maybe he does but who cares
I'll pull every hair out of him so he has no hairs

But I, I, I did you wrong, I admit I did
But now I'm facing the rest of my life alone, whoa

[Chorus]
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darling you'd still be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then darling you, you'd still be mine
Oh I'd never hurt you (If I could turn back)
Never do you wrong (If I could turn back)
And never leave your side (If I could turn back)
If I could turn back the hands
There'd be nothing I wouldn't do for you (If I could turn back)
Forever honest and true to you (If I could turn back)
If you accept me back in your heart, I love you (If I could turn back the hands)
(If I could turn back)
Oh oh, that would be my will
(If I could turn back)
Darling I'm begging you to take me by the hands
(If I could turn back the hands)
I'm going down, yes I am
(If I could turn back)
Down on my bended knee, yeah
(If I could turn back)
And I'm gonna be right there until you return to me
(If I could turn back the hands) Oh oh oh
(If I could turn back)
If I could just turn back that little clock on the wall

107,All Star,"[Verse 1]
Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

[Chorus]
Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

[Verse 2]
It's a cool place, and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how 'bout yours?
That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored

[Chorus]
Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star

Somebody once asked
Could I spare some change for gas?
""I need to get myself away from this place""
I said, ""Yep, what a concept

108,I'm Already Taken,"[Verse 1]
My little third grade hand wrote I love you
On a note of yellow paper
And sent it to the front of the row to a little blonde-haired girl
The blonde-haired girl just opened it and read it to herself
I was so embarrassed when she turned around and said

[Chorus]
I'm already taken
You spoke up too late
I love somebody else
So you'll just have to wait

[Verse 2]
The years flew by so quickly
And there we were in junior high
I realized that I still loved her so
So I called her up and told her exactly how I felt
Then she said there's something that you really ought to know

[Chorus]
I'm already taken
You spoke up too late
I love somebody else
So you'll just have to wait

[Bridge]
So wait I did and never changed my love for that little blonde-haired girl
Who's now the mother of our little blonde-haired boy
Who's to our hearts so close

[Verse 3]
I hate to think how fast he's growing up
Last night I overheard them as she tucked him into bed
He said, Mommy, will you marry me?
And this is what she said

[Chorus]
I'm already taken
You spoke up too late
I love your daddy, son
So you'll just have to wait

109,Beauty,"[Intro]
A thousand pieces in a jigsaw of beautiful mistakes
The debris of beauty flickers
In the sadness of a smile
It‚Äôs the perfection of your imperfection

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Beauty's when you just got out the shower
Hair still dripping, wrapped up in a towel
Beauty's when you ready in a hour
Them long legs, I call 'em the Twin Towers
You put that arch in it, put your hand on your hip
Put your hair in a bun, and you handle the shit
Beauty‚Äôs when the strut compliments sass
You know ya booty look good with ya confident ass (shit)
Straight up, but the rest swerve
You know it's beauty when the smile is her best curve
That's real beauty, no makeup shit
The girl you dream about, and wanna wake up with
Wait until I'm looking then you throw it at me
Go down on me, then you look up at me
Awhh man, that shit right there
Probably give your ex nightmares

[Interlude: Wale]
Miss Brooklyn New York
I'll give you whatever to get to your heart
Know your worth baby girl, love
This Soul Tape shit
Never make shift, all naturale
Put it down
Young Ralph, let's get it

[Verse 2: Wale]
Beauty is knowing nobody's real as you
Truly condolences for that pairs of shoes
Killing the scene, this type of love will make you complete
Now roll the weed and get the munchies, she be the cuisine
When Im her jeans I'm still in tune with the inner being
Her inner thoughts, her worst fears she give to me
Beauty is loyalty to the fullest
'Cause cupid made me a target for she had received a bullet
For she I get super deep, maybe speed up
Before I pull out and sex is a weapon
But beauty don‚Äôt need a bullet
Beauty is the beauty that her mother gave her
May you be guarded by God, me and grandmamas angels
It's God given, never complicated
A lot of niggas talking, I don‚Äôt have the heart to say it
The heart to tell you they see potential in how you do it
I pray you know your worth
When niggas don't notice your beauty, truly

[Outro: Fabolous]
You see, beauty isn't a rush
It's a process, sometimes it's slow
Yeah, I mean there's beauty in everything, ya know
You just gotta recognize it
Shoutout to the people who do
And I feel sorry for the people who don't

She's a rainbow and she loves the peaceful life
Knows I'll go crazy if I don't go crazy tonight
There's a part of me in the chaos that's quiet
And there's a part of you that wants me to riot
Everybody needs to cry or needs to spit
Every sweet tooth needs just a little hit
Every beauty needs to go out with an idiot
How can you stand next to the truth and not see it?

[Pre-Chorus]
A change of heart comes slow

[Chorus]
It's not a hill, it's a mountain
As you start out the climb
Do you believe me, or are you doubting
We're gonna make it all the way to the light
But I know I'll go crazy if I don't go crazy tonight

[Verse 2]
Every generation gets a chance to change the world
Pity the nation that won't listen to your boys and girls
Cos the sweetest melody is the one we haven't heard
Is it true that perfect love drives out all fear?
The right to appear ridiculous is something I hold dear
Oh, but a change of heart comes slow

[Chorus]
It's not a hill, it's a mountain
As you start out the climb
Listen for me, I'll be shouting
That we're gonna make it all the way to the light
But you now I'll go crazy if I don't go crazy tonight

Baby, baby, baby, I know I'm not alone
Baby, baby, baby, I know I'm not alone

113,A Man Ain't Made Of Stone,"I was supposed to be the rock
That you could stand on
Stronger than an old oak tree
But all you ever wanted was the one thing
I never let you see
The tender side of me
I tried to be a mountain, solid and strong
All it took was your leaving to know I was wrong
A man ain't made of stone
A man ain't made of steel
The way I feel right now
I thought I'd never feel
Sometimes all it takes
Is facing the night alone
And that's when you know
A man ain't made of stone
In this world of mine there was no room for weakness
I covered every crack in the wall
But there ain't no way that I can keep this secret
'Cause when you go like Jericho I fall
You thought I wouldn't shatter
Would I even care?
But there's more to what I'm made of
Than this broken heart can bare
A man ain't made of stone
A man ain't made of steel
The way I feel right now
I thought I'd never feel
Sometimes all it takes
Is facing the night alone
And that's when you know
A man ain't made of stone
Sometimes all it takes
Is facing the night alone
And that's when you know

I have slept upon your pew
I've dreamed of the divinity
Inside and out of you
I want it more than truth
I can taste it on my breath

Just for a little, a little death

So I'll come by and see you again

I will not touch upon your grace

To get the feeling right
We started making out
And she took off my pants

And that's about the time she walked away from me

Nine o' clock, home alone, paging you

Only bubble baths and back rubs
Hit me back, girl I hope, you hurry cause

I'm so anxious
So meet me at 11:30, I love the way you're talkin' dirty
Said, I'm so anxious
Girl could you quit this stallin', you know I'm a sexaholic

[Verse 2]
It's 10:10, where you been?
Did you get my message?
(Your expression is telling me that you've been thinkin' the same thang)
The same thang I've been thinkin'
You say you're working
Well hit me just as soon as your shift is over
And I'll be waiting, cause I can't sleep for reminiscing
Reminiscing about you and what we do, Hit me back
Ooooohh (And hope you hurry)

121,Cowboy,"[Verse 1]
Knock-knock, mothafucks, it's me, Mr. Clusterfuck
What, when, where, how, like who gives a fuck
Golf Wang M-O-B, mopping niggas ante up
Ain't been this fucking sick since brain cancer ate my Granny up
Rest in peace or lie in it, life ain't got no light in it
Darker than that closet that nigga Frankie was hiding in
Open it, dope in it, Bobby where's my fucking pipe?
Dress my little dick as Ike, twenty says I hit your wife
This is life, truthfully I just want to fly some kites
Grab Salem and Slater and go around, riding bikes
Get some ice cream, Golf Wang Roscoe's for the night
To skate around and do annoying shit that older peeps despise
Nigga fuck it though, going hard as riga mo
Got a nigga dollars and a couple cracker kids at shows
Cracked a couple kids in the head with this cast
Had a blast out in Europe, had a Swedish bitch licking toes
That's how it goes, designing clothes
Cats on everything, cats on everything
You think all this money will make a happy me?
But I'm 'bout as lonely as crackers that supermodels eat
Everybody's sparking but me, and I keep coughing
Can't keep calm in this spot's hot box and I'm getting nauseous
Hop in the car, ride to Saugus, and head straight to the office
Pissed off at Jasper because that's some faggot shit called ""Pink Dolphin""
I roll here on a mean unicorn
Green hat, Vans, Golf top is the team uniform
Downing that Capri Sun, tighten my bandana up
Something like a lez, I'm forgetting my damn manners cause

[Chorus]
I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy

[Verse 2]
When you're alone thoughts start coming in
Punching in that dark lock box and they start rummaging
Shit you've got to battle with, wishing they could skedaddle
But it makes your shadow say none, fun and grab the gun again
I needed to get out of the house
So I hit the Dead Sams, and we went biking it out
In a black hoodie, with an Arizona and a bag of Skittles
Just to see what all that fucking hype is about
Now everytime you see a roach you think of me, ay?
Cause everytime I see one I think what his parents would say
In court saying I ate him, I wasn't present that day
I was with Whitney smoking, sitting at the dock of the bay

[Chorus]
I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy

[Verse 3]
Do you know how weird it is knowing I make a bunch of cheese
While my friends can't afford little pizzas from Little Caesars
And their whole goal is to roll up and smoke bowls
So I don't feel bad when they not eating
(But you still treating us, you punk bitch)
Wolf Haley got more methods than Pinkman
I'm never civil, fuck Lincoln, 'Preme out the bag it's no wrinkles
I'm okie dokie and loopy and booboo nana and caca
If you think I'm fucking koo-koo, try talking to my shrink then

Some flicker of love
That still shines through

I am too young to be this stressed out
Tell me to wear this dress out

Outta my bed, outta my bed

134,Lightning Does The Work,"You know nothin's gettin' done
When talk is all you hear
Like someone revvin' up a truck
They never put in gear
But you don't see a cowboy run his mouth
And strut around
He just takes the bull by the horns
And throws him to the ground
Takin' care of business not just puttin' on a show
When it gets down to it, everybody knows

It ain't the smoke, it's the fire that gets the burnin' done
If it wasn't for the bullet, nobody'd fear the gun
It ain't the bark, it ain't the growl, it's the bite that hurts
Thunder's just a noise, boys, lightnin' does the work

You can talk about the farm or you can plow the ground
Argue with a rusty nail or hammer it on down
You can stand there in the dark cussin' at the night
Or you can just reach out your hand and turn on the light
There ain't no limit in this life to how far you can get
But if you're goin' all the way you gotta break a sweat

It ain't the smoke, it's the fire that gets the burnin' done
If it wasn't for the bullet, nobody'd fear the gun
It ain't the bark, it ain't the growl, it's the bite that hurts
Thunder's just a noise, boys, lightnin' does the work

I've heard thunder talkin' up a storm
Rattlin' my windows and knockin' on my door
But I've seen lightnin' blow a cypress tree in half
The thunder's busy talkin', and lightnin's kickin'

--- Instrumental ---

It ain't the smoke, it's the fire that gets the burnin' done
If it wasn't for the bullet, nobody'd fear the gun
It ain't the bark, it ain't the growl, it's the bite that hurts
Thunder's just a noise, boys, lightnin' does the work

Thunder's just a noise, boys, lightnin' does the work

It's gonna getcha, getcha good...",Chad Brock,1999,"[93, 88, 86, 86, 89, 89, 90, 93, 95, 97, 97, 97]",12

We're not that different at all

Yes you'll be in my heart
From this day on
Now and forever more

Don't listen to them
'Cause what do they know
We need each other, to have, to hold

When destiny calls you, you must be strong
I may not be with you
But you've got to hold on
They'll see in time, I know
We'll show them together

Cause you'll be in my heart
Believe me, you'll be in my heart
I'll be there from this day on

140,Jigga My N****,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we‚Äôre counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever

Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture

So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation

While rap has evolved, there‚Äôs no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard‚Äôs Hot Rap Songs chart, we‚Äôre counting down the top 100 songs in the tally‚Äôs quarter-century history.

141,Summer Girls,"[Intro]
Yeah, I like it when the girls stop by in the summer
Do you remember, do you remember
When we met that summer?

[Hook]
New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly when girls stop by
For the summer, for the summer
I like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone since that summer, since that summer

[Verse 1]
Hip hop, marmalade, spick-and-span
Met you one summer and it all began
You're the best girl that I ever did see
The great Larry Bird, Jersey 33
When you take a sip, you buzz like a hornet
Billy Shakespeare wrote a whole bunch of sonnets
Call me Willy Whistle 'cause I can't speak, baby
Somethin' in your eyes really drove me crazy
Now I can't forget you and it makes me mad
Left one day and never came back
Stayed all summer, then went back home
Macaulay Culkin was in Home Alone
Fell deep in love, but now we ain't speakin'
Michael J. Fox was Alex P. Keaton
When I met you, I said my name is Rich
You look like a girl from Abercrombie & Fitch

[Hook]
New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly when girls stop by
For the summer, for the summer
I like girls that wear Abercrombie and Fitch
I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone since that summer, since that summer

[Verse 2]
Cherry Pez, Coke Crush, Rock Stud, Boogie
Used to hate school, so I had to play hookie
Always been hip to the B-boy style
Known to act wild and make a girl smile
Love New Edition and the Candy Girl
Reminds me of you 'cause you rock my world
You come from Georgia, where the peaches grow
They drink lemonade and speak real slow
You love hip hop and rock and roll
Dad took off when you were four years old
There was a good man named Paul Revere
I feel much better, baby, when you're near
You love Fun Dip and Cherry Coke
I like the way you laugh when I tell a joke
When I met you, I said my name was Rich
You looked like a girl from Abercrombie & Fitch

New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly when girls stop by
For the summer, for the summer

I'd take her if I had one wish
But she's been gone since that summer, since that summer

[Verse 3]
In the summertime, girls got it goin' on
Shake and wiggle to a hip hop song
Summertime girls are the kind I like
I'll steal your honey, like I stole your bike
Boogaloo Shrimp and pogo sticks
My mind takes me back there oh so quick
Let you off the hook, like my man Mr. Limpet
Think about that summer and I bug 'cause I miss it
I like The Color Purple, macaroni and cheese
Ruby red slippers and a bunch of trees
Call you up, but what's the use?
I like Kevin Bacon, but I hate Footloose
Came in the door, I said it before
I think I'm over you, but I'm really not sure
When I met you, I said my name was Rich
You looked like a girl From Abercrombie & Fitch

[Hook]
New Kids On The Block had a bunch of hits
Chinese food makes me sick
And I think it's fly when girls stop by

But she's been gone since that summer, since that summer

Summer girls come and summer girls go
Some are worthwhile, and some are s- so
Summer girls come and summer girls go
Some are worthwhile, and some are so so

When we first met
You stole my heart away
Your love was incredible
Then you began to change

Now all you do is make me cry
Gave you my everything baby

So I'm leaving
It's all about you
And not about me

When we get in a fight
I'm be the first to apologize
Even if it was you who did wrong
Can't please you, can't go on
No matter what I do for you
It's never any good for you
Why you got to complain, it's insane
I can't stay

Repeat 1 (2x)

[Black Thought]:
Oh I see you got the Samsonite set out
For what to jet out?
What you can't take it no more
So you got to get out
Your back broke from that last straw
Oh you on the next plane out
Head games making it hard to maintain
Got a hypocritical love doing the same thing
Situation Kool and the Gang
To bursting in flames
And how relationships change
Worse than the pain for really
Your attitude kill me
Look at you in the doorway
Trying to ice grill me
Your heavy heart hurting
From trying to not feel me
Come in girl and put your suitcase down
We'll work it out as soon as I'm back from out of town
For now just stick around
I'll reach out from the airport
Soon as I hit the ground
Let's try to stay afloat in this sand
And not drown love
I know the time, I hear you calling out for real
You got to realize US is what is's all about

Dear Jacob
I won't take up too much of you time
I know you're trying to get your video game-grind on
And that's fine
Just gimme a second to empty my face
Before I hit the road again to go and win this paper chase
I've been watching you and
I'm proud of you man
You're growing up to be the best man that you possibly can
I know you understand
Why I go out of town
I also know my days are colder when you're not around
Sometimes I wonder what it's like to be adapted to the fact
That daddy never lived inside the same shack
And sometimes I get this pain in my stomach's pit
It's what I get
I'm convinced it's my punishment
For those nights I got drunk and let go at some bar
In some city with some people I don't know
For all the times that the lines on your face
Reminded me of the days before the dragonflies escaped
It trips me out how you pick up all my traits
From the way that you spit to the fists that you make
I watch the way you try to keep your mom happy
Daddy learned that from you
You're supposed to learn that from daddy
I can't teach much when it comes to women
I drive safe and slow but don't know nothing 'bout the engine
You're doing good little man that's all I really meant
I love you
You're my best friend, thanks for listening

[Verse 2: Slug]
Dear Craig, what up bones? How it goes?
Yeah, me? Well, you know, you know, same old, same old
Sorry that the phone calls ain't too routine
Just been runnin' around the globe tryin' to do my thing
Sometimes the weeks fly a little too fast
And sometimes I go to sleep a little too trashed
Other times I'm not sittin' on enough cash
And other times today feels too much like the past
Sometimes at night I would watch y'all fight
A child wonderin'
Why your life just ain't alright?
What's the violence about? Why's it in my house?
And even the memories are turned up too loud
Yeah, I got some issues in my head
Knew we should've started fixing 'em back when she left you
I'm not trying to get you down, I know you're different now
But your little man just wants you to listen now
I'm over 30, can't maintain relations
All these women want to hurt me and I just don't have the patience
I can't trust them, and they're not much help
When they start to push and pull the buttons I don't trust myself
What pride, fists, and words just might do?
I'm afraid of my fate, don't wanna turn out like you
I've never hit a woman
I won't do coke
And for that alone I love you and I want to thank you, old man

[Verse 3: Slug]
Dear Sean, what's going on? Not much to say
Just checkin' in with you, trying to see what's wrong today
I know there's gotta be something kicking your bruises
How's the love? How's the music? How's the self-abusiveness?
Got a lot to lose, it's breaking your shoulders
So you let your paranoia place your bets for you
Too many cigarettes, messing up your voice
Too many arguments, trying to test your poise
The only women that love you are fans and family
Mom has no choice, but fans leave you randomly
No heavy rotation in any location
You're not ready to face that you have no steady vocation
Plus you're getting old, your raps are exhausted
Stop it, everybody knows that you've lost it
Singing for these kids you don't know
When you should be at home with your own instead you're on the telephone
Fighting with your girl like it's you against the world
Another drunk hotel bedroom corner, curled up like a naked fetus
Come and save him Jesus
Place him back in time before the Reaganomics and Adidas
Sometimes you're not impressed with the work you've done
And love isn't love if you didn't hurt someone

Not because I look like Tyson Beckford
With the charm of Robert Redford
Oozing out my ears
But what she sees
Are my faults and indecisions
My insecure conditions
And the tears upon the pillow that I shed

She don't care about my big screen
Or my collection of DVD's
Things like that just never mattered much to her
Plus she don't watch too much TV

And she don't care that I can fly her
To places she ain't never been

Or because I'm such a hottie (sigh)
I like her for her
Not because she's phat like Cindy Crawford
She has got so much to offer
Why does she waste all her time with me?
There must be something there that I don't see

She likes me for me
Not because I'm tough like Dirty Harry
Make her laugh just like Jim Carrey
Unlike the ""Cable Guy""

But you'd be wrong
You'd be wrong

If you say that you love me
More than anybody
Than anyone's ever been loved before
As much as you love me
Baby I'll still love you
Baby I'll still love you more

And for every kiss
I'll kiss you back a hundred times
And for everything you do
I'll just do more
And for all the love you give
I'll give you so much back you'll see
Got so much love for you inside

If you say that you love me

Kaboom kaboom the platoon came on in eight limbs and timbs
Broke rims smoked sims whoop dogs with bent rims
For the real and the raw from whoo'd up with the law
I never kill for the thrill but I cut for the cause
Smokin' budda with a hoota' get better prices from looters
Shake my shell with the shooters leed a luga with duga
Some say modeling and acting mean Treach is selling
(man he's Sellin')
While I'm yelling first a felon with my gat at ya melon (BOOYAH)
Hella heated, I'm too ill for them to beat it
We the most cheated most weeded most needed
You best believe it
Lets take the tapes jam for me, stand for me
Your'e damned to be without the jamboree

[Vinnie]
We've put it down since the days of high school
And everywhere we Mark we rule
Naughty's about to raise our stock
And we didn't come to brag about what we got nigga
We came to rock
We blew the spot taking the streets to pac
You'd be thug-style for a while then cold rolled our jock
Using the last few years as our evidence
Niggas been tryin' to duplicate the mixture ever since
You live in value reprimanding
If you challenge me I guarantee
When we finish I'll be the last man standing
Fuck what you heard naughty is forever in demand
When Kay drop tracks all the party people jammin'

I ask the thugs who have mercy in these days is dirty
I'm still sturdy and flirty till my derby for jersey
The funk is pass-booted lights-camera-shoot it
I just did it to do it that's why I suit it and boot it
Here's the graphic niggas is just tattered and added
Orgy's are automatic from back-traffic to addicts
Crush the cabbage straight from the savage to lavish
We rip those who rat it thats why your click had it
(?dog?) cats to cuchies for me its lootchie then hootchies
Cause we'll drop a cuzzie that leaves your whole label woozy
And shitty and dizzy because your whole city miss me
And whip out they titties
And from they kiddies throw me 50's in bundles of 100's
And make every hater want it
Drunk and blunt it knock onto the hottest nigga comin'
Kay scratch and cut ya no matta what you make or
Wanna come and touch her the punani rusher like Usher

I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered
For just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away?
Away

I do recall now the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July 9th
The beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

[Chorus]
But now I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

[Verse 2]
I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I roll my eyes and then
You pull me in
I'm not much for dancing
But for you I did

Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

[Chorus]
And I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

[Bridge]
So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are

And I hope the sun shines
And it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you
You wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

[Chorus]
So I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this

One foot getting deeper
With a broken mirror and a blown-out speaker
I ain't got much else to lose

I'm faded

Been jaded
I've been dusted

I find myself here all the time

Found another goat I try to put the blame on
And now I'm stepping on all the cracks
So I guess there ain't no use

Missed the bus

How can it be, that right here with me
There's an angel, it's a miracle

Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep
When I look into your eyes I know that it's true

In all of creation, all things great and small
You are the one that surpasses them all
More precious than any diamond or pearl
They broke the mold when you came in this world

And I'm trying hard to figure out
Just how I ever did without
The warmth of your smile, the heart of a child
It's deep inside, and leaves me purified

They make me think of all you said

As you watch from heaven up above I know you're shining down I wish you werearound but you've gone away to a place where someday you and I will meet eachother, and forever
I pray that we'll always be together
You couldn't even sleep alone because you said that it was scary without me
Your tender heart will probably be hurt
Can I not go with you
Watching you, who can not fall asleep from the pain

173,Southern Gul,"Citation:415 F.Supp. 429 (S.D. Fla. 1975)

JAMES LAWRENCE KING, District Judge.
FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAWEastern Air Lines, Inc., hereafter Eastern, and Gulf Oil Corporation, hereafter Gulf, have enjoyed a mutually advantageous business relationship involving the sale and purchase of aviation fuel for several decades.

This controversy involves the threatened disruption of that historic relationship and the attempt, by Eastern, to enforce the most recent contract between the parties. On March 8, 1974 the correspondence and telex communications between the corporate  entities culminated in a demand by Gulf that Eastern must meet its demand for a price increase or Gulf would shut off Eastern's supply of jet fuel within fifteen days.

Eastern responded by filing its complaint with this court, alleging that Gulf had breached its contract and requesting preliminary and permanent mandatory injunctions requiring Gulf to perform the contract in accordance with its terms. By agreement of the parties, a preliminary injunction preserving the status quo was entered on March 20, 1974, requiring Gulf to perform its contract and directing Eastern to pay in accordance with the contract terms, pending final disposition of the case.

Gulf answered Eastern's complaint, alleging that the contract was not a binding requirements contract, was void for want of mutuality, and, furthermore, was ""commercially impracticable"" within the meaning of Uniform Commercial Code ¬ß 2-615; Fla. Stat. ¬ß¬ß 672.614 and 672.615.

The extraordinarily able advocacy by the experienced lawyers for both parties produced testimony at the trial from internationally respected experts who described in depth economic events that have, in recent months, profoundly affected the lives of every American.
THE CONTRACTOn June 27, 1972, an agreement was signed by the parties which, as amended, was to provide the basis upon which Gulf was to furnish jet fuel to Eastern at certain specific cities in the Eastern system. Said agreement supplemented an existing contract between Gulf and Eastern which, on June 27, 1972, had approximately one year remaining prior to its expiration.

The contract is Gulf's standard form aviation fuel contract and is identical in all material particulars with the first contract for jet fuel, dated 1959, between Eastern and Gulf and, indeed, with aviation fuel contracts antedating the jet age. It is similar to contracts in general use in the aviation fuel trade. The contract was drafted by Gulf after substantial arm's length negotiation between the parties. Gulf approached Eastern more than a year before the expiration of the then-existing contracts between Gulf and Eastern, seeking to preserve its historic relationship with Eastern. Following several months of negotiation, the contract, consolidating and extending the terms of several existing contracts, was executed by the parties in June, 1972, to expire January 31, 1977.

The parties agreed that this contract, as its predecessor, should provide a reference to reflect changes in the price of the raw material from which jet fuel is processed, i.e., crude oil, in direct proportion to the cost per gallon of jet fuel.

Both parties regarded the instant agreement as favorable, Eastern, in part, because it offered immediate savings in projected escalations under the existing agreement through reduced base prices at the contract cities; while Gulf found a long term outlet for a capacity of jet fuel coming on stream from a newly completed refinery, as well as a means to relate anticipated increased cost of raw material (crude oil) directly to the price of the refined product sold. The previous Eastern/Gulf contracts contained a price index clause which operated to pass on to Eastern only one-half of any increase in the price of crude oil. Both parties knew at the time of contract negotiations that increases in crude oil prices would be expected, were ""a way of life"", and intended that those increases be borne by Eastern in a direct proportional relationship of crude oil cost per barrel to jet fuel cost per gallon.

Accordingly, the parties selected an indicator (West Texas Sour); a crude which is bought and sold in large volume and was thus a reliable indicator of the market value of crude oil. From June 27, 1972 to the fall of 1973, there were in effect various forms of U.S. government imposed price controls which at once controlled the price of crude oil generally, West Texas Sour specifically, and hence the price of jet fuel. As the government authorized increased prices of crude those increases were in turn reflected in the cost of jet fuel. Eastern has paid a per gallon increase under the contract from 11 cents to 15 cents (or some 40%).

The indicator selected by the parties was ""the average of the posted prices for West Texas sour crude, 30.0-30.9 gravity of Gulf Oil Corporation, Shell Oil Company, and Pan American Petroleum Corporation"". The posting of crude prices under the contract ""shall be as listed for these companies in Platts Oilgram Service‚ÄîCrude Oil Supplement""

""Posting"" has long been a practice in the oil industry. It involves the physical placement at a public location of a price bulletin reflecting the current price at which an oil company will pay for a given barrel of a specific type of crude oil. Those posted price bulletins historically have, in addition to being displayed publicly, been mailed to those persons evincing interest therein, including sellers of crude oil, customers whose price of product may be based thereon, and, among others, Platts Oilgram, publishers of a periodical of interest to those related to the oil industry.

In recent years, the United States has become increasingly dependent upon foreign crude oil, particularly from the ""OPEC"" nations most of which are in the Middle East. OPEC was formed in 1970 for the avowed purpose of raising oil prices, and has become an increasingly cohesive and potent organization as its member nations have steadily enhanced their equity positions and their control over their oil production facilities. Nationalization of crude oil resources and shutdowns of production and distribution have become a way of life for oil companies operating in OPEC nations, particularly in the volatile Middle East. The closing of the Suez Canal and the concomitant interruption of the flow of Mid-East oil during the 1967 ""Six-Day War"", and Libya's nationalization of its oil industry during the same period, are only some of the more dramatic examples of a trend that began years ago. By 1969 ""the handwriting was on the wall"" in the words of Gulf's foreign oil expert witness, Mr. Blackledge.

During 1970 domestic United States oil production ""peaked""; since then it has declined while the percentage of imported crude oil has been steadily increasing. Unlike domestic crude oil, which has been subject to price control since August 15, 1971, foreign crude oil has never been subject to price control by the United States Government. Foreign crude oil prices, uncontrolled by the Federal Government, were generally lower than domestic crude oil prices in 1971 and 1972; during 1973 foreign prices ""crossed"" domestic prices; by late 1973 foreign prices were generally several dollars per barrel higher than controlled domestic prices. It was during late 1973 that the Mid-East exploded in another war, accompanied by an embargo (at least officially) by the Arab oil-producing nations against the United States and certain of its allies. World prices for oil and oil products increased.

Mindful of that situation and for various other reasons concerning the nation's economy, the United States government began a series of controls affecting the oil industry culminating, in the fall of 1973, with the implementation of price controls known as ""two-tier"". In practice ""two-tier"" can be described as follows: taking as the bench mark the number of barrels produced from a given well in May of 1972, that number of barrels is deemed ""old"" oil. The price of ""old"" oil then is frozen by the government at a fixed level. To the extent that the productivity of a given well can be increased over the May, 1972, production, that increased production is deemed ""new"" oil. For each barrel of ""new"" oil produced, the government authorized the release from price controls of an equivalent number of barrels from those theretofore designated ""old"" oil. For example, from a well which in May of 1972, produced 100 barrels of oil; all of the production of that well would, since the imposition of ""two-tier"" in August of 1973, be ""old"" oil. Increased productivity to 150 barrels would result in 50 barrels of ""new"" oil and 50 barrels of ""released"" oil; with the result that 100 barrels of the 150 barrels produced from the well would be uncontrolled by the ""two-tier"" pricing system, while the 50 remaining barrels of ""old"" would remain government price controlled.

The implementation of ""two-tier"" was completely without precedent in the history of government price control action. Its impact, however, was nominal, until the imposition of an embargo upon the exportation of crude oil by certain Arab countries in October, 1973. Those countries deemed sympathetic to Israel were embargoed from receiving oil from the Arab oil producing countries. The United States was among the principal countries affected by that embargo, with the result that it experienced an immediate ""energy crises.""

Following closely after the embargo, OPEC (Oil Producing Export Countries) unilaterally increased the price of their crude to the world market some 400% between September, 1973, and January 15, 1974. Since the United States domestic production was at capacity, it was dependent upon foreign crude to meet its requirements. New and released oil (uncontrolled) soon reached parity with the price of foreign crude, moving from approximately $5 to $11 a barrel from September, 1974 to January 15, 1974.

Since imposition of ""two-tier"", the price of ""old oil"" has remained fixed by government action, with the oil companies resorting to postings reflecting prices they will pay for the new and released oil, not subject to government controls. Those prices, known as ""premiums"", are the subject of supplemental bulletins which are likewise posted by the oil companies and furnished to interested parties, including Platts Oilgram.

Platts, since the institution of ""two-tier"" has not published the posted prices of any of the premiums offered by the oil companies in the United States, including those of Gulf Oil Corporation, Shell Oil Company and Pan American Petroleum, the companies designated in the agreement. The information which has appeared in Platts since the implementation of ""two-tier"" with respect to the price of West Texas Sour crude oil has been the price of ""old"" oil subject to government control.

Under the court's restraining order, entered in this cause by agreement of the parties, Eastern has been paying for jet fuel from Gulf on the basis of the price of ""old"" West Texas Sour crude oil as fixed by government price control action, i.e., $5 a barrel. Approximately 40 gallons of finished jet fuel product can be refined from a barrel of crude.
Against this factual background we turn to a consideration of the legal issues.
I
THE ""REQUIREMENTS"" CONTRACTGulf has taken the position in this case that the contract between it and Eastern is not a valid document in that it lacks mutuality of obligation; it is vague and indefinite; and that it renders Gulf subject to Eastern's whims respecting the volume of jet fuel Gulf would be required to deliver to the purchaser Eastern.

The contract talks in terms of fuel ""requirements"". The parties have interpreted this provision to mean that any aviation  fuel purchased by Eastern at one of the cities covered by the contract, must be bought from Gulf. Conversely, Gulf must make the necessary arrangements to supply Eastern's reasonable good faith demands at those same locations. This is the construction the parties themselves have placed on the contract and it has governed their conduct over many years and several contracts.
In early cases, requirements contracts were found invalid for want of the requisite definiteness, or on the grounds of lack of mutuality. Many such cases are collected and annotated at 14 A.L.R. 1300.

As reflected in the foregoing annotation, there developed rather quickly in the law the view that a requirements contract could be binding where the purchaser had an operating business. The ""lack of mutuality"" and ""indefiniteness"" were resolved since the court could determine the volume of goods provided for under the contract by reference to objective evidence of the volume of goods required to operate the specified business. Therefore, well prior to the adoption of the Uniform Commercial Code, case law generally held requirements contracts binding. See 26 A.L.R.2d 1099, 1139.

The Uniform Commercial Code, adopted in Florida in 1965, specifically approves requirements contracts in F.S. 672.306 (U.C.C. ¬ß 2-306(1)).
(1) A term which measures the quantity by the output of the seller or the requirements of the buyer means such actual output or requirements as may occur in good faith, except that no quantity unreasonably disproportionate to any stated estimate or in the absence of a stated estimate to any normal or otherwise comparable prior output or requirements may be tendered or demanded.The Uniform Commercial Code Official Comment interprets ¬ß 2-306(1) as follows:
2. Under this Article, a contract for output or requirements is not too indefinite since it is held to mean the actual good faith output or requirements of the particular party. Nor does such a contract lack mutuality of obligation since, under this section, the party who will determine quantity is required to operate his plant or conduct his business in good faith and according to commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade so that his output or requirements will approximate a reasonably foreseeable figure. Reasonable elasticity in the requirements is expressly envisaged by this section and good faith variations from prior requirements are permitted even when the variation may be such as to result in discontinuance. A shut-down by a requirements buyer for lack of orders might be permissible when a shut-down merely to curtail losses would not.

The essential test is whether the party is acting in good faith.

Similarly, a sudden expansion of the plant by which requirements are to be measured would not be included within the scope of the contract as made but normal expansion undertaken in good faith would be within the scope of this section. One of the factors in an expansion situation would be whether the market price has risen greatly in a case in which the requirements contract contained a fixed price. Reasonable variation of an extreme sort is exemplified in Southwest Natural Gas Co. v. Oklahoma Portland Cement Co., 102 F.2d 630 (C.C.A. 10, 1939).Some of the prior Gulf-Eastern contracts have included the estimated fuel requirements for some cities covered by the contract while others have none. The particular contract contains an estimate for Gainesville, Florida requirement.
The parties have consistently over the years relied upon each other to act in good faith in the purchase and sale of the required quantities of aviation fuel specified in the contract. During the course of the contract, various estimates have been exchanged from time to time, and, since the advent of the petroleum allocations programs, discussions of estimated requirements have been on a monthly (or more frequent) basis.
The court concludes that the document is a binding and enforceable requirements contract.
II
BREACH OF CONTRACTGulf suggests that Eastern violated the contract between the parties by manipulating its requirements through a practice known as ""fuel freighting"" in the airline industry. Requirements can vary from city to city depending on whether or not it is economically profitable to freight fuel. This fuel freighting practice in accordance with price could affect lifting from Gulf stations by either raising such liftings or lowering them. If the price was higher at a Gulf station, the practice could have reduced liftings there by lifting fuel in excess of its actual operating requirements at a prior station, and thereby not loading fuel at the succeeding high price Gulf station. Similarly where the Gulf station was comparatively cheaper, an aircraft might load more heavily at the Gulf station and not load at other succeeding non-Gulf stations.

The court however, finds that Eastern's performance under the contract does not constitute a breach of its agreement with Gulf and is consistent with good faith and established commercial practices as required by U.C.C. ¬ß2-306.

""Good Faith"" means ""honesty in fact in the conduct or transaction concerned"" U.C.C. ¬ß1-201(19). Between merchants, ""good faith"" means ""honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade""; U.C.C. ¬ß2-103(1)(b) and Official Comment 2 of U.C.C. ¬ß2-306. The relevant commercial practices are ""courses of performance,"" ""courses of dealing"" and ""usages of trade.""[6]

Throughout the history of commercial aviation, including 30 years of dealing between Gulf and Eastern, airlines' liftings of fuel by nature have been subject to substantial daily, weekly, monthly and seasonal variations, as they are affected by weather, schedule changes, size of aircraft, aircraft load, local airport conditions, ground time, availability of fueling facilities, whether the flight is on time or late, passenger convenience, economy and efficiency of operation, fuel taxes, into-plane fuel service charges, fuel price, and, ultimately, the judgment of the flight captain as to how much fuel he wants to take.

All these factors are, and for years have been, known to oil companies, including Gulf, and taken into account by them in their fuel contracts. Gulf's witnesses at trial pointed to certain examples of numerically large ""swings"" in monthly liftings by Eastern at various Gulf stations. Gulf never complained of this practice and apparently accepted it as normal procedure. Some of the ""swings"" were explained by the fueling of a single aircraft for one flight, or by the addition of one schedule in mid-month. The evidence establishes that Eastern, on one occasion, requested 500,000 additional gallons for one month at one station, without protest from Gulf, and that Eastern increased its requirements at another station more than 50 percent year to year, from less than 2,000,000 to more than 3,000,000 gallons, again, without Gulf objection.

The court concludes that fuel freighting is an established industry practice, inherent in the nature of the business. The evidence clearly demonstrated that the practice has long been part of the established courses of performance and dealing between Eastern and Gulf. As the practice of ""freighting"" or ""tankering"" has gone on unchanged and unchallenged for many years accepted as a fact of life by Gulf without complaint, the court is reminded of Official Comment 1 to U.C.C. ¬ß2-208:
The parties themselves know best what they have meant by their words of agreement and their action under that agreement is the best indication of what that meaning was.From a practical point of view, ""freighting"" opportunities are very few, according to the uncontradicted testimony, as the airline must perform its schedules in consideration of operating realities. There is no suggestion here that Eastern is operating at certain Gulf stations but taking no fuel at all. The very reason Eastern initially desired a fuel contract was because the airline planned to take on fuel, and had to have an assured source of supply.

If a customer's demands under a requirements contract become excessive, U.C.C. ¬ß2-306 protects the seller and, in the appropriate case, would allow him to refuse to deliver unreasonable amounts demanded (but without eliminating his basic contract obligation); similarly, in an appropriate case, if a customer repeatedly had no requirements at all, the seller might be excused from performance if the buyer suddenly and without warning should descend upon him and demand his entire inventory, but the court is not called upon to decide those cases here.

Rather, the case here is one where the established courses of performance and dealing between the parties, the established usages of the trade, and the basic contract itself all show that the matters complained of for the first time by Gulf after commencement of this litigation are the fundamental given ingredients of the aviation fuel trade to which the parties have accommodated themselves successfully and without dispute over the years.
The practical interpretation given to their contracts by the parties to them while they are engaged in their performance, and before any controversy has arisen concerning them, is one of the best indications of their true intent, and courts that adopt and enforce such a construction are not likely to commit serious error.Manhattan Life Ins. Co. of New York v. Wright, 126 F. 82, 87 (8th Cir. 1903). Accord, Spindler v. Kushner, 284 So. 2d 481, 484 (Fla. App. 1973).

The court concludes that Eastern has not violated the contract.
III
COMMERCIAL IMPRACTICABILITYGulf's commercial impracticability defenses are premised on two sections of the Uniform Commercial Code specifically ¬ß¬ß2-614 (F.S. 672.614) and 2-615 (F.S. 672.615). The former does not require notice while the latter does.

Eastern argues that U.C.C. ¬ß2-615 is procedurally inapplicable as Gulf did not give Eastern the notice mandated by the section.
""c) The seller must notify the buyer seasonably that there will be delay or nondelivery and, when allocation is required under paragraph (b), of the estimated quota thus made available for the buyer.""At worst, however, Eastern had specific notice of Gulf's intention to rely on this section when Gulf filed its memorandum of law in opposition to Eastern's motion for summary judgment in the summer, 1974. Gulf also raised this section as an affirmative defense when it filed its answer in the fall, 1974 and is therefore entitled to a ruling. Official Comments 4 and 8 to U.C.C. ¬ß2-615 provide:
4. Increased cost alone does not excuse performance unless the rise in cost is due to some unforeseen contingency which alters the essential nature of the performance. Neither is a rise or a collapse in the market in itself a justification, for that is exactly the type of business risk which business contracts made at fixed prices are intended to cover. But a severe shortage of raw materials or of supplies due to a contingency such as war, embargo, local crop failure, unforeseen shutdown of major sources of supply or the like, which either causes a marked increase in cost or altogether prevents the seller from securing supplies necessary to his performance, is within the contemplation of this section. (See Ford & Sons, Ltd., v. Henry Leetham & Sons, Ltd., 21 Com.Cas. 55 (1915, K.B.D.).)

* * * * * *

8. The provisions of this section are made subject to assumption of greater liability by agreement and such agreement is to be found not only in the expressed terms of the contract but in the circumstances surrounding the contracting, in trade usage and the like. Thus the exemptions of this section do not apply when the contingency in question is sufficiently foreshadowed at the time of contracting to be included among the business risks which are fairly to be regarded as part of the dickered terms, either consciously or as a matter of reasonable, commercial interpretation from the circumstances. (See Madeirense Do Brasil, S.A. v. Stulman-Emrick Lumber Co., 147 F.2d, 399 (C.C.A. 2 Cir. 1945).).In short, for U.C.C. ¬ß2-615 to apply there must be a failure of a pre-supposed condition, which was an underlying assumption of the contract, which failure was unforeseeable, and the risk of which was not specifically allocated to the complaining party. The burden of proving each element of claimed commercial impracticability is on the party claiming excuse. Ocean Air Tradeways, Inc. v. Arkay Realty Corp., 480 F.2d 1112, 1117 (9th Cir. 1973).

The modern U.C.C. ¬ß2-615 doctrine of commercial impracticability has its roots in the common law doctrine of frustration or impossibility and finds its most recognized illustrations in the so-called ""Suez Cases"", arising out of the various closings of the Suez Canal and the consequent increases in shipping costs around the Cape of Good Hope. Those cases offered little encouragement to those who would wield the sword of commercial impracticability. As a leading British case arising out of the 1957 Suez closure declared, the unforeseen cost increase that would excuse performance ""must be more than merely onerous or expensive. It must be positively unjust to hold the parties bound."" Ocean Tramp Tankers v. V/O Sovfracht (The Eugenia), 2 Q.B. 226, 239 (1964). To the same effect are Tsakiroglou and Co. Ltd. v. Noblee Thore G.m.b.H., 2 Q.B. 348 (1960), aff'd, A.C. 93 (1962), and Caparanoyoti & Co., Ltd. v. E. T. Green, Ltd., 1 Q.B. 131, 148 (1959). These British precedents were followed by the District of Columbia Circuit, which gave specific consideration to U.C.C. 2-615, Comment 4, in Transatlantic Financing Corp. v. United States, 124 U.S.App.D.C. 183, 363 F.2d 312, 319 (1966).

Other recent American cases similarly strictly construe the doctrine of commercial impracticability. For example, one case found no U.C.C. defense, even though costs had doubled over the contract price, the court stating, ""It may have been unprofitable for defendant to have supplied the pickers, but the evidence does not establish that it was impossible. A mere showing of unprofitability, without more, will not excuse the performance of a contract.""   Schafer v. Sunset Packing Co., 256 Or. 539, 474 P.2d 529, 530 (1970).

Recently, the Seventh Circuit has stated: ""The fact that performance has become economically burdensome or unattractive is not sufficient for performance to be excused"". We will not allow a party to a contract to escape a bad bargain merely because it is burdensome"". ""[T]he buyer has a right to rely on the party to the contract to supply him with goods regardless of what happens to the market price. That is the purpose for which such contracts are made,"" Neal-Cooper Grain C. v. Texas Gulf Sulfur Co., 508 F.2d 283, 293, 294 (7th Cir. 1974). To the same effect are American Trading and Production Corporation v. Shell International Marine Ltd., 453 F.2d 939 (2d Cir. 1972); United States v. Wegematic Corp., 360 F.2d 674 (2d Cir. 1966); Whitlock Corp. v. United States, 159 F.Supp. 602, 606, 142 Ct.Cl. 758 (1958); Maple Farms, Inc. v. City School District, 76 Misc.2d 1080, 352 N.Y.S.2d 784 (Sup.Ct. 1974); Perry v. Champlain Oil Co., Inc., 101 N.H. 97, 134 A.2d 65, 67 (1957). See also, Ballou v. Basic Construction Co., 407 F.2d 1137, 1141 (4th Cir. 1969); Natus Corp. v. United States, 371 F.2d 450, 456, 178 Ct.Cl. 1 (1967); and Portland Section of Council of Jewish Women v. Sisters of Charity, 266 Or. 448, 513 P.2d 1183 (1973).

Gulf's argument on commercial impracticability has two strings to its bow. First, Gulf contends that the escalator indicator does not work as intended by the parties by reason of the advent of so-called ""two-tier"" pricing under Phase IV government price controls.  Second, Gulf alleges that crude oil prices have risen substantially without a concomitant rise in the escalation indicator, and, as a result, that performance of the contract has become commercially impracticable.

The short and dispositive answer to Gulf's first argument under U.C.C. ¬ß2-615, that the price escalation indicator (posting in Platt's Oilgram Crude Oil Supplement) no longer reflects the intent of the parties by reason of the so-called ""two-tier"" pricing structure, is that the language of the contract is clear and unambiguous. The contract does not require interpretation and requires no excursion into the subjective intention of the parties. The intent of the parties is clear from the four corners of the contract; they intended to be bound by the specified entries in Platt's, which has been published at all times material here, which is published today, and which prints the contract reference prices. Prices under the contract can be and still are calculated by reference to Platt's publication.

It should be noted that Platt's Oilgram Crude Oil Supplement states on its face that its postings since the advent of ""two-tier"" are basically comparable to the postings historically quoted in Platt's, and that postings listed in Platt's were price controlled at the time of negotiation and execution of the contract, just as they are today and have been at all times in between. In addition, Gulf's expert witness Mr. Coates testified that oil companies, including Gulf, continue to use ""old oil"" prices (the prices reported in Platt's) for contracts between themselves. Finally, as to the indicator crude (West Texas Sour) there is no showing that the Platt's postings do not reflect the market price for that oil today. The testimony is in substantial dispute but the court finds, with respect to domestic oil, some 60 percent of Gulf's 1974 domestic production was old oil. With respect to foreign crude oil, domestic prices were considerably lower than imported price at the beginning of the period in question so that the West Texas Sour Crude postings unquestionably did not reflect foreign crude oil postings. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary it may be reasonably inferred that virtually all transactions in West Texas Sour Crude Oil take place at the postings reflected in Platt's, since most of the production in that field is ""old"" oil.

With regard to Gulf's contention that the contract has become ""commercially impracticable"" within the meaning of U.C.C. ¬ß2-615, because of the increase in market price of foreign crude oil and certain domestic crude oils, the court finds that the tendered defense has not been proved. On this record the court cannot determine how much it costs Gulf to produce a gallon of jet fuel for sale to Eastern, whether Gulf loses money or makes a profit on its sale of jet fuel to Eastern, either now or at the inception of the contract, or at any time in between. Gulf's witnesses testified that they could not make such a computation. The party undertaking the burden of establishing ""commercial impracticability"" by reason of allegedly increased raw material costs undertakes the obligation of showing the extent to which he has suffered, or will suffer, losses in performing his contract. The record here does not substantiate Gulf's contention on this fundamental issue.

Gulf presented evidence tending to show that its ""costs"" of crude oil have increased dramatically over the past two years.

However, the ""costs"" to which Gulf adverts are unlike any ""costs"" that might arguably afford ground for any of the relief sought here. Gulf's claimed ""costs"" of an average barrel of crude oil at Gulf's refineries (estimated by Gulf's witness Davis at about $10.00 currently, and about $9.50 during 1974) include intra-company profits, as the oil moved from Gulf's overseas and domestic production departments to its refining department. The magnitude of that profit was not revealed.

With respect to Gulf's foreign crude oil ""costs"", the record shows that at the very time Gulf was in the process of repudiating its contract with Eastern (January 1974), Gulf's profit margin on foreign crude oil brought into the United States (Cabindan and Nigerian) was approximately $4.43 to $3.88 per barrel compared with profits of $0.92 and $0.88 respectively, one year earlier.[11] That margin may now have declined, but the record discloses that Gulf's overseas subsidiaries have enjoyed substantial profits from crude oil transactions and that those profits are included in the ""average"" crude oil ""costs"" of which Gulf now complains. The ""transfer"" prices at which Gulf ""sells"" its foreign oil to its domestic subsidiaries are set by a pricing committee in Gulf's Pittsburgh home office. Intra-company profit can be and is allocated among those 400-plus corporate subsidiaries of Gulf, largely through the transfer price device, to optimize overall benefit to the corporation, as documents from the committee reveal. Internal memoranda from the pricing committee introduced into evidence showed for instance that the committee had before it the view of one of its tax experts that every $1 increase in Nigerian oil prices resulted in a 50 to 90 cent benefit to the company; other memoranda describe how profits might be assigned, through intercompany sales, to various other offshore subsidiaries to obtain favorable tax treatment for the purpose of maximizing the advantages to the corporation for the benefit of the parent corporation. Similarly, there are memoranda reflecting a policy of charging the highest prices possible to the United States.

In like manner, the ""per barrel"" cost calculations which Gulf introduced at trial reflect ""in house"" profits from Gulf's domestic production. During the discovery process, Gulf developed for Eastern certain  ""cost"" figures. Those data show that a Gulf-produced barrel of domestic crude oil is reflected on Gulf's books at a cost of approximately $2.44 for the nine-month period ending September 30, 1974. Yet, for purposes of computing an overall average ""cost"" to Gulf of a barrel of crude oil for trial purposes (estimated by Gulf's economist witness Davis on the stand at about $9.50 for that period), Gulf used, not the $2.44 actual booked cost, but a ""transfer"" price, equal to ""postings"" and including intra-company profit. To the extent ""old oil"" postings are reflected in the domestic oil ""transfer price"", the intra-company profit would be on the order of $2.76 per barrel, measured against the $5.20 posting listed in Platt's for West Texas Sour Crude; ""new"" oil ""transfer prices"" would include an even larger profit margin. Gulf estimated that some 70 percent of domestic oil going into Gulf's refineries was its own proprietary production.

Again, these are not the kinds of ""costs"" against which to measure hardship, real or imagined, under the Uniform Commercial Code. Under no theory of law can it be held that Gulf is guaranteed preservation of its intra-company profits, moving from the left-hand to the right-hand, as one Gulf witness so aptly put it. The burden is upon Gulf to show what its real costs are, not its ""costs"" inflated by its internal profits at various levels of the manufacturing process and located in various foreign countries.

No criticism is implied of Gulf's rational desire to maximize its profits and take every advantage available to it under the laws. However, these factors cannot be ignored in approaching Gulf's contention that it has been unduly burdened by crude oil price increases.

No such hardship has been established. On the contrary, the record clearly establishes that 1973, the year in which the energy crises began, was Gulf's best year ever, in which it recorded some $800 million in net profits after taxes. Gulf's 1974 year was more than 25% better than 1973's record $1,065,000,000 profits were booked by Gulf in 1974 after paying all taxes.

For the foregoing reasons, Gulf's claim of hardship giving rise to ""commercial impracticability"" fails.

But even if Gulf had established great hardship under U.C.C. ¬ß2-615, which it has not, Gulf would not prevail because the events associated with the so-called energy crises were reasonably foreseeable at the time the contract was executed. If a contingency is foreseeable, it and its consequences are taken outside the scope of U.C.C. ¬ß2-615, because the party disadvantaged by fruition of the contingency might have protected himself in his contract, Ellwood v. Nutex Oil Co., 148 S.W.2d 862 (Tex.Civ.App.1941).

The foreseeability point is illustrated by Foster v. Atlantic Refining Co., 329 F.2d 485, 489 (5th Cir. 1964). There an oil company sought release from a gas royalty contract because the royalty provisions of the contract did not contain an escalation clause, with the result that the oil company came to receive a far smaller share of the royalties than it would then have been able to obtain on the market. Citing Ellwood, id., with approval, the Fifth Circuit answered the oil company's argument as follows:
(O)ne who unconditionally obligates himself to do a thing possible of performance, must be held to perform it (citing cases); and though performance, subsequent to the contract, may become difficult or even impossible, (this) does not relieve the promisor, and particularly where he might have foreseen the difficulty and impossibility (citing cases).The record is replete with evidence as to the volatility of the Middle East situation, the arbitrary power of host governments to control the foreign oil market, and repeated interruptions and interference with the normal commercial trade in crude oil. Even without the extensive evidence present in the record, the court would be justified in taking judicial notice of the fact that oil has been used as a political weapon with increasing success by the oil-producing nations for many years, and Gulf was well aware of and assumed the risk that the OPEC nations would do exactly what they have done.

With respect to Gulf's argument that ""two-tier"" was not ""foreseeable"", the record shows that domestic crude oil prices were controlled at all material times, that Gulf foresaw that they might be de-controlled, and that Gulf was constantly urging to the Federal Government that they should be de-controlled. Government price regulations were confused, constantly changing, and uncertain during the period of the negotiation and execution of the contract. During that time frame, high ranking Gulf executives, including some of its trial witnesses, were in constant repeated contact with officials and agencies of the Federal Government regarding petroleum policies and were well able to protect themselves from any contingencies.

Even those outside the oil industry were aware of the possibilities. Eastern's principal contract negotiator advised his superior in recommending this contract to him:
While Gulf is apparently counting on crude price increases, such increases are a fact of life for the future, except as the government may inhibit by price controls, therefore all suppliers have such anticipation.

1975 is the year during which the full effect of energy shortages will be felt in the United States according to most estimates.Knowing all the factors, Gulf drafted the contract and tied the escalation to certain specified domestic postings in Platt's. The court is of the view that it is bound thereby.

The court is further of the opinion that U.C.C. ¬ß2-614(2) is not applicable to this case. It provides:
(2) If the agreed means or manner of payment fails because of domestic or foreign governmental regulation, the seller may withhold or stop delivery unless the buyer provides a means or manner of payment which is commercially a substantial equivalent. If delivery has already been taken, payment by the means or in the manner provided by the regulation discharges the buyer's obligation unless the regulation is discriminatory, oppressive or predatory.It is clear that this section dealing with ""means or manner of payment"" speaks, by way of illustration, to the blocking by governmental interference with the contemplated mode of monetary exchange. (e.g., when a contract provides for payment in gold specie and the government subsequently forbids payment in gold). No such issue appears in the case at bar and U.C.C. ¬ß2-614 is inapposite here.
IV
REMEDYHaving found and concluded that the contract is a valid one, should be enforced, and that no defenses have been established against it, there remains for consideration the proper remedy.

The Uniform Commercial Code provides that in an appropriate case specific performance may be decreed. This case is a particularly appropriate one for specific performance. The parties have been operating for more than a year pursuant to a preliminary injunction requiring specific performance of the contract and Gulf has stipulated that it is able to perform. Gulf presently supplies Eastern with 100,000,000 gallons of fuel annually or 10 percent of Eastern's total requirements. If Gulf ceases to supply this fuel, the result will be chaos and irreparable damage.

Under the U.C.C. a more liberal test in determining entitlement to specific performance has been established than the test one must meet for classic equitable relief. U.C.C. ¬ß2-716(1); Kaiser Trading Co. v. Associated Metals & Minerals Corp., 321 F.Supp. 923, 932 (N.D.Cal.1970), appeal dismissed per curiam 443 F.2d 1364 (9th Cir. 1971).

It has previously been found and concluded that Eastern is entitled to Gulf's fuel at the prices agreed upon in the contract. In the circumstances, a decree of specific performance becomes the ordinary and natural relief rather than the extraordinary one. The parties are before the court, the issues are squarely framed, they have been clearly resolved in Eastern's favor, and it would be a vain, useless and potentially harmful exercise to declare that Eastern has a valid contract, but leave the parties to their own devices. Accordingly, the preliminary injunction heretofore entered is made a permanent injunction and the order of this court herein.
CONCLUSIONSFor the foregoing reasons, the court makes the following ultimate findings of fact and conclusions of law:

The court has jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter of this litigation.
The contract at issue is a valid requirements contract.
The contract was performed by the parties in accordance with its terms up to and including December 31, 1973, and Eastern has continued so to perform since that time.
On December 31, 1973, Gulf breached the contract by declaring it no longer to be in effect.
The contract is not lacking in mutuality nor is it commercially impracticable, and Eastern has performed its obligations thereunder.
Eastern is entitled to enforcement of the contract, and the preliminary injunction heretofore issued, requiring specific performance according to the terms of the contract, be and the same is hereby made permanent.
DONE and ORDERED in chambers at the United States Courthouse for the Southern District of Florida, Miami, Florida this 20th day of October, 1975.

Footnotes:

[1] Eastern's complaint as filed, and as subsequently amended, contained other counts, alleging tort, antitrust, and FEA violations. Gulf successfully moved to strike those counts from the complaint, alleging that because the preliminary injunction was granted as Eastern had prayed, Eastern did not suffer the damages alleged in its complaint.

[2] Gulf also, in addition to answering the complaint, filed a counterclaim, asking the court to set a price for jet fuel to be provided under the contract. By agreement of counsel, consideration of the counterclaim was deferred pending disposition of Eastern's breach of contract count, it being understood that if Eastern prevailed on its claim, Gulf's counterclaim would stand dismissed as moot.

[4] ""Gulf agrees to sell and deliver to Eastern, and Eastern agrees to purchase, receive and pay for their requirements of Gulf Jet A and Gulf Jet A-1 at the locations listed. . . .""

[5] A requirements contract under the U.C.C. may speak of ""requirements"" alone, or it may include estimates, or it may contain maximums and minimums. In any case, the consequences are the same, as Official Comments 2 and 3 indicate. Comment 2 is set out in the text above. Comment 3 provides:
""3. If an estimate of output or requirements is included in the agreement, no quantity unreasonably disproportionate to it may be tendered or demanded. Any minimum or maximum set by the agreement shows a clear limit on the intended elasticity. In similar fashion, the agreed estimate is to be regarded as a center around which the parties intend the variation to occur.""[6] U.C.C. ¬ß2-208(1) defines ""course of performance"" as those ""repeated occasions for performance by either party with knowledge of the nature of the performance and opportunity for objection to it by the other.""

U.C.C. ¬ß1-205(1) defines ""course of dealing"" as ""a sequence of previous conduct between the parties to a particular transaction which is fairly to be regarded as establishing a common basis of understanding for interpreting their expressions and other conduct.""

U.C.C. ¬ß1-205(2) defines ""usage of trade"" as ""any practice or method of dealing having such regularity of observance in a place, vocation or trade as to justify an expectation that it will be observed with respect to the transaction in question.""
U.C.C. ¬ß2-208(2) provides that ""express terms shall control course of performance and course of performance shall control both course of dealings and usage of trade.""

[8] The average price paid by Eastern to Gulf has risen more than 40% over the life of the contract.

[9] The parties have stipulated that Eastern has been paying prices mandated by the contract terms.

[10] Gulf's contention that the publication of the postings has been ""suspended"" and therefore that a proviso of Article II of the contract, declaring the consequences of ""suspension"", has been triggered, is without merit. The Proviso deals, in the clearest of terms, with Platt's ceasing to publish either in toto or in regard to the specified postings, neither of which is the case here. Furthermore, the proviso contains its own prescription for remedial action in the case of suspension, including notice and substitution of other indicators. Gulf has never attempted to follow the prescribed remedy; thus its argument fails for procedural as well as substantive reasons.

[11] Gulf's international oils expert, Mr. Blackledge testified that foreign oil costs were up four-fold during 1973-74 but Gulf's profits also went up four-fold in that period.

174,Fortunate,"[Verse 1]
I highly doubt that y'all think about sex
Anywhere near as often as I think about death
Go ahead and shout at the top of your lungs
But don't wake the baby up, we got a lot to get done
That little light indicates a connection
And if it's all the same I'd like to make a suggestion
See, if everybody on this comet agreed
We could set the clock to whenever we want it to be
I just might just modify the mileage
I don't know much, but I'm confident the fight's fixed
So high that I feel like a pilot
Falling out the sky full of brilliant brightness
Hurry up, stir me up
You gotta learn the words before the whole Earth burning, but
We wouldn't even need to recognize your birthday
If you were the center of the universe in the first place
If I had feathers I would fly away
If I felt fresher in fur I would hibernate
If I ever figured out how to communicate
Maybe then we could accumulate
For now face the wall, I ain't the same as y'all
A real friend wouldn't make you take the fall
Sometimes life'll try to break your balls
With the long list of missed wakeup calls

You know I wanna feel special
Walk around the festival carrying a big stuffed animal
I try not to make a mess though
Gotta stay sensible, ain't nobody coming with the antidote
I wanna watch you grow
And I wanna leave the planet better off than it was handed to me
And I don't know, there's possibility
So I settle for selling my soul to the slaves of the land of the free
I don't wanna leave my family tree behind
I don't want no one to miss me like I miss you
But I don't wanna take up too much time
I'm not trying to run away from the line we drew
The sunshine seems to feel so seamless
The soldier is a dreamer and a realist
And history sealed this
Taught me that a hero ain't nothing but a field trip
Nah, I know you're down to do something profound
Put a stick in the ground to prove you was around
No amount of time will ever be considered enough
I'm trying to tether it up and live forever through love

I'm pretty sure of it

When you come home tonight
And turn on the light
Don't you be surprised to find

[Chorus 1]
My little good-byes
Empty hangers by the closet door
Lipstick tube on the bathroom floor
My little good-byes
Unpaid bills by the kitchen phone
I took the Beatles, left Billy Joel
Little good-byes, little good-byes

I'm sure, you're sure I'll be back in just an hour or two
You'll tape a Hallmark to my door
They always said it better than you
And if you're wondering
When you're gonna hear from me
Well, take a real good look around boy
And it won't hard to see
When you come home tonight and turn on the light
Don't you be surprised to find

[Chorus 2]
My little good-byes
Took your favorite Dodger's hat
Left the litter, but I took the cat
My little good-byes
Loaded up the TV in the back of my car
Have fun watching the VCR
Little good-byes, oh baby, little good-byes

[Bridge]
So, cry to your mama
And your sympathetic friends and tell'em
And tell them how the story ends

[Chorus 3]
My little good-byes
Took the hourglass, left the sand
Now you got time on your hands
My little good-byes
Took the statue from Japan
Funny little Buddha man

[Chorus 4]
My little good-byes
Change my voice on the machine
Or there'll be little good-byes with every ring
My little good-byes
Left the pictures and took the frame
I've got the umbrella, here comes the rain
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Little good-byes
Rain - yeah, yeah, yeah

I blink twice 'til my eyes close on my face
Deep breaths, struggling to reach home base
Awkward nigga, motherfucker, this is a race
God made me great, so I been invisible to hate
Partly humane, part of the same, part of the game
Used to smoke a Parliament before I partied with my pain
And Bacardi was the same, 151 to your brain
But I'd rather beg my pardon than to party with you lames

[Chorus: Meechy Darko]
Fuck money, fuck friends, fuck family
Fuck pussy, fuck drugs, fuck sanity
I don't give a shit, why?
'Cause ignorance is bliss, right

Fuck the jury, fuck the judge in the nightgown
I don't give a shit, why?
'Cause ignorance is bliss, right

[Verse 2: Zombie Juice]
Sit back and analyze my life like Montana did white
All the bitches I hit, and all the bitches I might
Clearly underrated amongst all the favorite
But fuck it, my style's like Magic Speed Seduction
I'ma keep smoking 'til my lungs collapse
And fuck y'all laws, I'ma keep my straps
Setting the plans, controlling mine and reaching the land
I'm better off dead, somebody fill my head up with lead
Dropped out of high school, lint in my pocket
I picked up the profit, the block bitching, bitches is hawking
Grandma don't want me, Grandpa kinda lonely
Pay my dues, wear my jewels, refuse, never I lose
But fuck that, on my last dollar and my bus pass
Fucking with some niggas that'll give a mother fuck
Who fucking with us? No one fucking with us, time to reconsider
Zombie gang, walking dead, none iller

Fuck money, fuck friends, fuck family
Fuck pussy, fuck drugs, fuck sanity

Fuck your faculty, your fans, and your music
Fuck the engineer and the nigga that produced it
Fuck your religion, your god, and your guidance
Tell Virgin Mary time for Meech to pop that hymen
Fuck the moon, fuck the stars, fuck Venus and Mars
Fuck a Rolex and diamond ring with them flashy cars
Fuck the last supper, fuck your church and its gospel
Fuck them halfway dead niggas in the hospital
Fuck my left lung, fuck my right lung
Fuck my chrome gun, fuck my black gun
Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
Drop five bombs, fuck that I'm on
Like the mic I record with, fuck global warming
Fuck heaven and hell, purgatory
Fuck the pastor, fuck you for giving him offering
Fucking exhausted from all these fucks
I'm fucking off this nigga, what the fuck

182,Lately,"[Intro: Witt Lowry]
Yeah

[Verse 1: Witt Lowry]
Lately, I been reminded, they say that time's of the essence
You pulled me deep from the trenches, I guess we're here for confessions
And lately, I been reminded that love is patient and blind
I could write a million lines and never find the words to define us
I know it's best not to rush
I know you're unsure of your worth, I know how deep that can cut
He broke you down, so you don't feel much, there's forty-thousand strings
Holding back our past precaution, not often I let you in
It's not often you let me in, I get it, I mean why would you to
Take a chance on me then? I get it, I mean why should you?
'Cause me, I'm just a waiter with lucid dreams of the music
And you, you could find any guy, open mind in a student
I say it, in case we lose it, I hope that that never happens
I know our love runs deeper than just lust and attraction
I guess it's all the little things lately that make me think
I remember nights by the beach and us laughin' 'til we can't breathe
Or that CVS down the street, I don't know if you would agree
But I think

[Chorus: Dia Frampton]
Someday I'll change for you
Right now I'm tryna get better
Old flames still burn like new
Some ties are hard to sever
And these walls don't lie, all they speak is truth
In this empty room, all I see is you
Someday I'll change for you
Right now I'm tryna get better

[Verse 2: Witt Lowry]
Lately, I been reminded that love is all that is timeless
The pain you paint on your face, I see strength behind both your eyelids
And lately I been reminded, I'm flawed, and nobody's perfect
The distance isn't easy, but nothin' is when it's worth it
I'm workin' to bring your wall down, I sense the weight that you carry
I wish you would let it all out and trust me, because I can't see
I wish you wouldn't compare me, he loved you without your clothes
But no, he's never seen you naked, never seen into your soul
And I love the way I see your mind wander when I get deep with you
I wonder why you cry when I tell you that I believe in you
I wish that I could take away the pain of how he treated you
My favorite nights were nights when it felt like it were just me and you
Damn, and if you ever cannot stand me
I hope that I made an impact and showed your heart what love can be
Envision us with a family, envision us where it's sandy
I feel you bringin' me closer in love with lovin' what can be
I know

[Chorus: Dia Frampton]
Someday I'll change for you
Right now I'm tryna get better
Old flames still burn like new
Some ties are hard to sever
And these walls don't lie, all they speak is truth
In this empty room, all I see is you
Someday I'll change for you
Right now I'm tryna get better

[Verse 3: Witt Lowry]
I think about the nights you cried as you reminisce on your parents
And the way you know that money can't buy love is apparent
You're self-conscious of your ears, your hair's always down when you wear it
And you know I never drink when I'm Sak√© drunk, it's apparent
I know, I just love watching you grow, you feel the weight on my soul
I always mess with a temp, I'm always hot when you're cold
And if they told us our love was just for a season
I want you to know I loved you, I gave my all and I mean it
I know‚Ä¶

[Chorus: Dia Frampton]
Someday I'll change for you
Right now I'm tryna get better

What up brown skin, your body smellin' like cinnamon
Hair in a bun, your toes done so feminine
Heard you suck your teeth like, oh no here we go again
Let me get your name so I can be more genuine
No need to front, the kid knows you got many friends
Many mens who waitin' to stake a claim on it
Put they name down just to spit some game on it
But fuck friends I'm tryna set the mood
You know, go at you hard like most records that's sold
Spit propaganda at you to you break down and fold
You look confused miss thing like I'm speakin' in code
76-64 press pound hello
Are you listenin' now? Did I get your attention?
Undivided? Because you used to be undecided
Now you looking fluxed like those chicks with they nose stuck up
Just put your number down girl what the fuck

[Refrain: Phonte]
Hey yo that's alright girl, whatever you say
Whatever you say, whatever you say
Yo that's alright girl, whatever you say
Whatever you say, whatever you say
Don't worry bout it girl, whatever you say
Whatever you say, whatever you say
Ok alright, whatever you say
Whatever you say, whatever you say

[Verse 2: Phonte]
Ayo, I usually play the background
You know clean cut, soft spoken, well dressed
Dipped out straight chillin', when I'm in the club, yo
Sippin' the Sprite with the ill lemon mixed in it
Sippin' on it I was just chillin', til I saw you
That's when my heart stopped, knees gave
Head sweatin', jaws locked, I was sweating you
Like goddamn, girl, you got a nigga going buckwild
Mesmerized, starstruck, I was thinking maybe we can go out
Like to the movies or the Applebees, Blockbuster, state fair
But you looked at me and said, ""Fuck that!
You just a herb with no money and no Jeep and no condo
And I thought that Little Brother had a record deal""
Ok I see where you going now, wanna sweat a nigga
When you think he got a cash advance
And some personal time but fuck that
I got your head still bobbin' and my verse didn't rhyme
So it's whatever girl

[Refrain: Phonte]
Hey yo that's alright girl, whatever you say
Whatever you say, whatever you say
Yo that's alright girl, whatever you say

Don't worry bout it girl, whatever you say
Whatever you say, whatever you say
Ok alright, whatever you say
Whatever you say, whatever you say

[Verse 3: Rapper Big Pooh & Phonte]
Check it so what I'm chubby, y'all chicks still love me
Like to rub on my tummy while I tell you somethin' funny
Whisper in your ear 'til them panties go fallin'
What's my name (Big Pooh) yea that's what she be callin'
Oh yea I know I'm husky but chicks still love me
3 o'clock still have they ass running to Waffle House fa me
Be feelin' on that ass till my name they be calling and shit
Get 'em so wet they make a Freudian slip
And fall down into my verbal abyss
That's straight Reservoir Dog style
Perfecto, served with a kiss
Mwah, baby, it's just like this no need to fight it
Invite it try me out you just might like it
American pie shit try anything out once
Forever stained your memory like white shirts and punch
I get the hunch that a nigga's on your menu
Do me a favor girl, come check me at the next venue

[Outro: Rapper Big Pooh, Phonte, & Both]
Hey yo Big Pooh check this out
You go to your girls' house and I'm a go to mine
Cause I know my girl is definitely mad
Cause it took us too long to do this album
Yo I hear what you saying
Let's just pump the music up and count our money
Hey you well check this out
Yo 9th turn the bass down and
Just let the beat keep on rockin
And we out of here
Yo what happened to ""peace""?

And wines and dines me
Took me home to meet his mama
How he loves me

Give it one more try
Before you give up on love

Have a show with fifty million viewers?

Struggling day to day just trying to get this paper
Hoping the day would come when things would go my way
But now I'm living lavish and all I do is hear them say

Did you ever think that you would have these hits?
Did you ever think that you would be the don?
Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn?
Did you ever think that you would be this paid?
Were there times when your ass was real afraid?
Did you ever think that you would sell out tours?

187,Who Needs Pictures,"[Verse 1]
There's an old Kodak camera in my dresser drawer
I ran across it just this afternoon
And I realized that I don't ever use it anymore
In fact last time I did I think it was with you

[Verse 2]
When we were down in Cozumel
We had the whole beach to ourselves
And it's crazy now to think
That it's all there on that film
And I could take it to the store
To be developed, but what for
I can still see everything just fine
And who needs pictures with a memory like mine

[Verse 3]
Standing there I couldn't help but think about
Everything that might be on that roll
I think it even has another trip we took
I guess that must've been at least three years ago

[Verse 4]
When we were down in Baton Rouge
And there wasn't much to do
So we drove into New Orleans every afternoon
And I swear that you would think
That it was only yesterday
Cause I can still see everything just fine
Who needs pictures with a memory like mine

[Verse 5]
Somewhere in my closet
There's a cardboard box just sitting on a shelf
It's full of faded memories
And it's been there ever since the night you left

[Verse 6]
Oh, just forgotten photographs
To remind me of the past
Oh, but I can still see everything just fine
Who needs pictures with a memory like mine
Yeah, who needs pictures with a memory like mine",Brad Paisley,1999,"[97, 86, 69, 65, 67, 68, 67, 67, 67, 68, 75, 78, 85]",13

Aiyyo my song's on, I gotta get my grub on some to-to

Pullin more hoes off the looks (you gettin' jelly)
You wan' hate me? Cause your wifey, wants a autograph?
From the look in her eyes, I can see she wants more than that
When I see fat asses I make fat passes like quarterback
Beatnuts is ALLA THAT, your shit, ALL THE WACK
Open can-dela, if you foolin' wit my cheddah
Hardrock, ever since, junior high escuela
Fly fella, takin my beats, to make your crowd get up
I'm fed up, niggas wanna bring it -- WHATEVER!
I'mma storm your pa-rade (pa-rade) blow your legs off
With a gre-nade, now you flappin', like a mermaid
Yappin off, bitch you cough at the lips
While I'm at the bar, baggin', the bartender tips
Then I bag this chick, with a, ""Hi,"" and the eye
She did the butterfly, rubbin' her ass, against my buttonfly
I could already imagine my shit stuck inside
Everytime I strike, haters be like, ""Dat fucking guy!""

To the killers who be lovin' the chicas and champagne

Players who be pimpin' the hoes with no brains
Front watch a nigga get shot from close range
The most range, crazy motherfucker won't change
Beatnuts, forever diehard, you want pain?
Cause you walkin' outta here breathin' is insane
Flip a beat fast, you leave the club with a heat rash
You got a weak stash, came in the club with a free pass
I ain't even know they made a Roley for your cheap ass
Makin me laugh, you was in jail wearin' kneepads
Now the beef has gotten over your head
It's over you dead, Ranger Rover, both of your legs
Till both of us said, platinum gettin' took this year

Wanna belong in, wanna belong in

But if you're really going away
Here's some final words from me

Baby, write this down, take a little note
To remind you in case you didn't know
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go
Write this down

Take my words and read them every day
Keep them close by, don't you let them fade away
So you'll remember what I forgot to say
Write this down

[Verse 2]
I'll sign it at the bottom of the page
I'll swear under oath
Cause every single word is true
And I think you need to know

So use it as a bookmark
Stick it on your refrigerator door
Hang it in a picture frame up above the mantel
Where you'll see it for sure

Because now a nigga hot enough to fuck with one of Satan' hoes
And she can't tell the difference, I been through hell conditions
Wishing for air conditioning, feeling God was never listening
Now I'm on television, and did I fail to mention?
Your bitch is tired of missionary, boy you failed the mission
Speaking of positions just witness how I elevate it
Real niggas celebrate it, finger fuck whoever hate it
My life accelerated, but had to wait my turn
Then I redecorated, that mean my tables turned
Live life, might as well, only way to learn
Is try and fail, clientele the only way to earn
So if you're selling crack, or if you're selling rap
Make sure it's mean so them fiends keep on coming back

Guess it's something like your girl, nigga it ain't came yet

It's like we all headed to Spain they took the boat I took the plane, damn
That boy's sick now hoes on his joystick
Heating up like May weather, dog I'm on that Floyd shit

Might want to purchase some game, homey your shit is so wack

Satisfy my appetite with something spectacular
Check your vernacular, and then I get back to ya

Someone whispered ""Where's her halo?""
Cause she had an angel's face
He stood there smiling
Holding on to the one who took my place

I wonder if he told her she's the best he's ever known
The way he told me ev'ry night when we were all alone
She'll find out when the new wears off
He'll find somebody new
She'll learn what the heartache's all about
And what I'm going through

Warm as the morning sun

Just like the waves down by the shore
We're going to keep on coming back for more
Cause we don't ever want to stop
Out in this brave new world you seek
Oh the valleys and the peaks
And I can see you on the top

You'll find better love
Strong as it ever was
Deep as the river runs
Warm as the morning sun

Late at night when you're not sleeping
And moonlight falls across your floor

213,Two Teardrops,"(bill anderson/steve wariner)
(track 2 - time 4: 29)

Two teardrops were floatin' down the river
One teardrop said to the other
I'm from the soft blue eyes of a woman in love
I'm a tear of joy she couldn't carry
She was so happy she just got married
I was on her cheek when she wiped me away with her glove
I could tell from the look on her face she didn't need me
So I drifted on down and caught me a ride to the sea

The other tear said we've got a connection
I'm a tear of sorrow born of rejection
I'm from the sad brown eyes of her old flame
She told him they would be lifelong companions
Left him with questions and not any answers
I was on his cheek as he stood there calling her name
I could tell he had a lot of my friends for company
So I drifted on down and caught me a ride to the sea

Oh the ocean's a little bit bigger tonight
Two more teardrops somebody cried
One of them happy and one of them bluer than blue
The tide goes out and the tide comes in
And someday they'll be teardrops again
Released in a moment of pleasure or a moment of pain
Then they drift on down and ride to the sea again

Last night I sat in the waiting room
The nurse walked in and gave me the news
It's a baby girl and they're both fine
An old man sittin' not 10 feet away
Just lost his wife and he said to me
You've got a brand new angel and I've lost mine
I guess the good lord giveth and the good lord taketh away
And we both wiped a teardrop from our face

Oh the ocean's a little bit bigger tonight
Two more teardrops somebody cried
One of them happy and one of them bluer than blue
The tide goes out and the tide comes in
A whole new circle of life begins
Where tears are a part of the pleasure and part of the pain
'til they drift on down and ride to the sea again

Two teardrops floatin' down the river

214,Every Morning,"[Intro]

From the corner of my girlfriend's four-post bed
I know it's not mine, but I'll see if I can use it for
The weekend or a one-night stand

[Verse 1]
Couldn't understand
How to work it out
Once again, as predicted, left my broken heart open
And you ripped it out
Something's got me reeling
Stopped me from believing
Turn me around again
Said that we can do it
You know I wanna do it again

Turn me around again
Said we couldn't do it

He said. ""Don't worry about a thing, baby doll

And she sweared, ""Goddamn, if I find that man, I'm cuttin' off his balls!""
And then she heads for the clinic and she gets some static walkin' through the door:
They call her a killer, and they call her a sinner, and they call her a whore!

I've seen a good man sin
I've seen a tough man cry

And a sad man grin

And the down side of up
And everything between
I licked the silver spoon
Drank from the golden cup
Smoked the finest green

I stroked the baddest dimes
At least a couple of times
Before I broke their heart

You know where it ends
Yo, it usually depends
On where you start

He used to get fat stacks out on the corner with drugs
He liked to hang out late at night
Liked to get shit faced
And keep pace with thugs

Until late one night there was a big gunfight
Max lost his head
He pulled out his chrome .45
Talked some shit
And wound up dead

Now his wife and his kids are caught in the midst of all of his pain
You know it comes that way
At least that's what they say
When you play the game

God forbid you ever had to wake up to hear the news

220,One Honest Heart,"[Verse 1]
Times are tough on an honest heart
People don't follow through with what they start
Lying eyes looking at me up and down
Making talk that's only cheap
Making promises they never keep
But I keep looking for what I still haven't found

[Chorus]
One honest heart
That I can believe in
Two loving arms that will never let me go
One good man that I can count on
It shouldn't be so hard
Finding one honest heart

[Verse 2]
Now I've been close a time or two
I thought I saw my dreams coming true
But I was just living in a fairy tale
I won't play the fool again
I won't play a game that I can't win
But I still have faith and I keep telling myself, there's

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I don't think I'm asking too much
Just once in my life I want to be touched by

So why the hell you keep on pagin' me
I told you once before
I'm gonna say it once again
Don't you call no more

Talkin' about my baby's mom
She's still layin' in my arms
She is my favorite girl

I saw you around my way
Ridin' by my crib
Just the other day
The order of protection was restranin' me
I couldn't take the chance of someone namin' me
You tryin' to frame me
Leave me alone
Callin' me and hangin' up the wife was home
How'd you get my number in the first place
The shit ain't even listed under my name

You callin' me
And you tellin' me
That you wantin' me
And you needin' me
'Cause you're lonely
And you can't see
How I could be with another B
I - T - C - H
And that she could never be my wifey
Why can't you see it wasn't meant for you to be with me

You so damn (crazy girl)
Thinkin' I would ever leave my baby
My lady
The only one
Who's there for me
Who cares for me
My destiny
Who knows the things
That's best for me
And about me (i'm not leavin my home)
This ecstasy would always mean the world to me

Like a snowman‚Äîground-up
Like round chuck, and still put hands on you
Stayin' wound up is how I spend time (Get it?)
Sucker free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes
I just got that air about me like wind chimes (Yeah)
'Nother day in the life (Uh)
Used to have to scrape to get by (Yeah)
Now my community's gated and I
Made it and my neighbors say hi (Say hi)
I'm givin' 'em pounds, I'm upscale now
Guess it means I'm way in the sky (Way in the sky)
But I still remember the days of
Minimum wage for general labor
Welfare recipient since a minor
Look how government assistance has made ya!
Adversity, if at first you don't succeed
Put your temper to more use
'Cause bein' broke's a poor excuse
That should only give you more fuel
Show 'em why you're you
So close, God, it's like I almost got it
But close only counts in time bombs and horseshoes
So I Unabomb shit‚Äîtick, tick, tick‚Äîno remorse, pew!
Screw it, I'm lit, and that attitude I blew up on quick
That's why they call me firecracker
I grew up on WIC‚Äîwick, wick, wick‚Äîwith a short fuse
I got some important news to report to
Anyone who thought I was done: nah bitch, not quite
Spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours?

[Chorus]
Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

[Verse 2]
Man, I know sometimes
These thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice
To me they're just ink blots
I just fling 'em like slingshots and so precise
So you might wanna think it over twice (Yeah)
Or you retards can roll the dice
But beef will at least cost you your career
'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced
But this middle finger's free as a bird
Nuke warhead at birth, hugest forehead on Earth
Too short for the verse, studied his formula, learned
How to incorporate a curse
Point it towards corporate America
Stick a fork in and turn
'Cause four-letter words are more better heard
The world force-fed a turd to me, you're getting yours
But sometimes I overdo it, but I just get so into it
I was there consolin' you when no one knew it
When your situation showed no improvement
I was that door, you walked over to it
I'm the light at the end of the tunnel
So people are always lookin' to me as they're goin' through it
When that tunnel vision is unclear
Shit becomes too much to bear
Since ""Cleanin' Out My Closet""
When I was havin' trouble with the snare
I'm that unrealistic prayer answered
And I'ma get you jacked up like you're tryna fix a flat, uh
When you struggle with despair
That double-fisted, bare-knuckles coupled with this pair
Of nuts I'm cuppin', I am your 'fuck it' switch, nothin' can compare

Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

[Verse 3]
Started from the bottom like a snowman
Oh man, put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that
But my battery's low, I'ma need a boost to my pack
And I know that I always got Proof at my back
I called you ""Proof"" because I knew for a fact
My ace in the hole, homie, I'm callin' on you
'Cause I think I'm slowly startin' to lose faith in it, so
Give me that inkling and mo‚Äì
‚Äìtivation to go, Hussein with the flow
Fake fans that are two-faced didn't show
Let heartbeats loop, produce hate in my soul
Layin' vocals two days in a row
True statement, hate to go down this road
But there's only one route to cross this bridge
So I walk in this bitch with loose change
'Cause all my dues paid, but this booth's takin' its toll
But it's never too late to start a new beginnin'
That goes for you too, so what the fuck you gon' do?
Use the tools you're given!
Or you're gon' use the cards you're dealt
As an excuse for you to not do shit with 'em?
I used to play the loser/victim
'Til I saw the way Proof was driven
I found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet
And when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets
Fanny packs, hourglasses
If time was on my side, I'd still have none to waste
Man, in my younger days
That dream was so much fun to chase
It's like I'd run in place
While this shit dangled in front of my face
But how do you keep up the pace
And the hunger pangs once you've won the race?
When that dual exhaust is coolin' off
'Cause you don't got nothin' left to prove at all
'Cause you done already hit 'em with the coup de gr√¢ce
Still you feel the need to go full tilt

Your heroes for ghosts
Hot ashes for trees
Hot air for a cool breeze
Cold comfort for change

If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?

You say that I'm paranoid
But I‚Äôm pretty sure the world is out to get me
It‚Äôs not like I make the choice
To let my mind stay so fucking messy

But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same

[Chorus: Kiiara]
I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy?

If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on

[Bridge: Chester Bennington & Kiiara]
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
I know I'm not the center of the universe

Thinking everything‚Äôs about me

My friend's got a girlfriend
Man, he hates that bitch

He says, ""Man, I really gotta lose my chick
In the worst kind of way.""

Fuck it, I won't interrupt you, get them stacks bae

If I gotta creep up on you with a masked face
Or put these bitches on the blade, fuck Backpage (fuck that)

Run that bitch like Diddy, have you walkin' for some cheesecakes
Makin' that band say I'm the man 'cause that D came
Had a bitch that look like Cassie workin' three blades
I got a bitch who fuck me off the syrup, booty out
Smuggling something, got a porno over Mookie house
She got a body on her, pockets healthy
Which one look better, is it Kendra, is it Elthy?
I need a miracle, might ask the lord to help me
She a project bitch but look hella clean

Thought about your orphans, how they probably starvin'
Thought about this artful shit, how I'm so thoughtful

Walkin' 'round like the campus of Harvard
Shoutout my nigga Swizz, niggas gettin' smarter
Try to hit the books, and nigga hit the target

And make sure my Barbies keep an extra Barbie

And her pussy better smell like a orchid

Damn, I wish I drank a lil more water
Damn, my weed stank a lil more harder

With a yellowbone car

Believe we deserve every leaf in the forest
Kis and quarters layin' around my headquarters
Borderline hoarder, you a mortal, I report her
World on my shoulders but it's lighter than a clover
I'm your bitch, baby, hold me tighter than a stroller
System so solar, got white like Crayola
Nut like granola all in your bitch rollers
You never been in jail, I never been in a Corolla
Then I roll a blunt 'bout as thick as a Samoan
This is that six shit, the sickness is showin'
The sickness is spreadin', the disease is growin'
The bitches is hoein', the witnesses knowin'
The dollars are torn, they're fishin' for coins

I rip off his horns, six in the mornin'

How does it feel
To treat me like you do?
When you've laid your hands upon me
And told me who you are?
I thought I was mistaken
I thought I heard your words
Tell me how do I feel?
Tell me now, how do I feel?
Those who came before me
Lived through their vocations
From the past until completion
They'll turn away no more
And still, I find it so hard
To say what I need to say
But, I'm quite sure that you'll tell me
Just how I should feel today

[Verse 2]
I see a ship in the harbour
I can and shall obey
But, if it wasn't for your misfortune
I'd be a heavenly person today
And I thought I was mistaken
And I thought I heard you speak
Tell me, how do I feel?
Tell me now, how should I feel?
Now I stand here waiting

I thought I told you to leave me
When I walked down to the beach
Tell me how does it feel

238,I'll Think Of A Reason Later,"I heard he was gonna marry some girl from Denver
Then my sister came over
Had the Sunday paper with her
There was the girl on the social page
Looking in love and all engaged
We decided she don't take a very good picture

It may be my family's redneck nature
Rubbing off
Bringing out unlady-like behavior
It sure ain't Christian to judge a stranger
But I don't like her
She may be an angel who spends all winter
Bringing the homeless blankets and dinner
A regular Nobel Peace Prize winner
But I really hate her
I'll think of a reason later

I drew horns and blacked out her tooth with a marker
Childish, yes, but she made such a thin little target
I couldn't be happier on my own
But I've got the slightest of a jealous bone
And seeing her with him tends to enlarge it

It may be my family's redneck nature
Rubbing off
Bringing out unlady-like behavior
It sure ain't Christian to judge a stranger
But I don't like her
She may be an angel who spends all winter
Bringing the homeless blankets and dinner
A regular Nobel Peace Prize winner
But I really hate her
I'll think of a reason later

Inside her head may lay all the answers
For curin' diseases from baldness to cancer
Salt of the earth and a real good dancer
But I really hate her
I'll think of a reason later

Well, it was just one tooth
Did I mention I don't particularly care for her?

Little Bobby put his trust in a girl
She promised him the world
She even fucked him like no other
She said she didn‚Äôt want him for his money
And made him do something funny, like fall in love
But all the while she was a skeezer, a fuckin mind teaser
She learned his whereabouts
His in and outs, the way he moved
And then he married her with his heart wide open
And then she killed him (yeah)
Just to be a thousandaire (hahahaha)
Fuck you love, fuck you love (Woo!)
Fuck you love...

Hello love, I know you‚Äôre real
And I know you can have me killed, have me killed

241,I Drive Myself Crazy,"[Verse 1]
Lying in your arms so close together
Didn't know just what I had
Now I toss and turn cause I'm without you
How I'm missing you so bad
Where was my head? Where was my heart?
Now I cry alone in the dark

[Chorus]
I lie awake, I drive myself crazy
Drive myself crazy thinking of you
Made a mistake when I let you go baby
I drive myself crazy wanting you the way that I do
(Wanting you the way that I do)

[Verse 2]
I was such a fool, I couldn't see it
Just how good you were to me
(Just how good you were to me)
You confessed your love

Undying devotion
I confessed my need to be free
And now I'm left with all this pain
I've only got myself to blame, no

Drive myself crazy thinking of you
Made a mistake when I let you go baby

It's nothing, it's so normal
You just stand there
I could say so much
But I don't go there because I don't want to
I was thinking if you were lonely
Maybe we could leave here and no one would know
At least not to the point that we would think so

[Chorus]
Everyone here, knows everyone here is thinking about
Somebody else
Well, it's best if we all keep this under our heads
I couldn't tell, if anyone here was feeling the way I do
But I'm lonely now
And I don't know how
To get it back to good

[Verse 2]
This don't mean that, you own me, well
This ain't no good, in fact it's phony as hell
Yeah, but things worked out just like you wanted too
If you see me out, you don't know me
Try to turn your head, try to give me some room
Oh, to figure out just what I'm going to do

[Chorus 2]
Because everyone here, hates everyone here for doing
Just like they do
And It's best if we all keep this quiet instead
And I couldn't tell, why everyone here was doing me like they do
But I'm sorry now, and I don't know how
To get it back to good
Everyone here, is wondering what it's like to be with
Somebody else
And everyone here's to blame, and everyone here
Gets caught up in the pleasure of the pain, well everyone hides
Shades of shame, yeah but looking inside we're the same
We're the same
And we're all grown now, yeah, but we don't know how
To get it back to good

Everyone here, knows everyone here is thinking 'bout

And it's best if we all keep this under our heads

The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead

Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

We push and pull like a magnet do

[Verse 2]
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

You don't bring me anything but down

You don't bring me anything but down
You don't bring me anything but down
When you come 'round

[Verse 3]
Maybe I'm not your perfect kind
Maybe I'm not what you had in mind
Maybe we're just killing time
You with your silky words
And your eyes of green and blue
You with your steel beliefs
That don't match anything you do
It was so much easier before you became you

But you don't bring me anything but down
You don't bring me anything but down
You don't bring me anything but down

And kickin'' in nigga take a step back
It ain't even all that nigga catch a cap
If ya don't wanna brawl jack

When me and my click searchin' for trouble to find

No he didn't but I'll you

Hook:

Hitter quitter skull splitter triggers from Inglewood

Watch us bring wreck quick
Road Dawgs the next kick
Pluggin' you jugular vein it pour like rain when ya neck whip

235 thick
Ingelwood Illtown click

Low hot off the bricks trot off or get shot off in the mix

Boobie and Luvchild staying trues paying dues

Madmen with ten millimeter heaters sprayin' fools
And slaying crews

Who wanna tangle get caught up and dangled yoked and strangle

In a fight straight soldiers swingin' pipes from every angle

Keep my hand on the nitty Glock fifty
Swift with my tool to lift any fool that wanna fuck with me

Don't sleep on Jersey nor California shit is grimmy trim ya limb
Blood and phlegm is all on him after we warn ya
It's curtains kids certain things we won't allow
Cause that how we stand with ours klickow klickow

Treach:
Word to the mother my mother was the only checkin' mines
So motherfuck your mother's father if he step like mines
Swift kicking cocks I hit spots and blocks
So listen pops then I'll miss you like I miss measles
Mumps plus fuckin' chicken pox
Givin' props to all the Old school that paved the way
Plus zero I fear no hero you think will up and save the day hey
Three letters describing that ass here's a clue
S-C-K the only thing missing is you
Excuse up's excuse um you've yet to lose one two ton
Crews son doing more then leaving bruised gums
Try it riot I'll roll quiet you'll never catch the trap
Cause I ain't the the the that to flap the yap
A black alley cats can catch my back
And to that and these scrap
Back to back wreck to wreck and wreck necks
Of macks fake macks break their necks to say I take that back

But nowadays we roll in fuckin' tanks with rims

247,Let Me Know,"[Intro: Tori Solkowski]
Quite surprised
Just one look into your eyes
Can change my mind
Then again, I don't mind
I seem to find
All the answers to the questions I don't like
But you make them all alright

[Verse 1: Witt Lowry]
Yeah, I often wonder what really it is that you offer me
At least I feel your touch, even if it's just when you walk on me
Your mind is always elsewhere, it's there, it's on, then it's off of me
I want to feel your depth, but your heart is deaf when you talk to me
I guess that's what we were taught
We open up dependin' on how many drinks we have bought
He wants your head and it's ironic, doesn't care 'bout your thoughts
You're one more drink away from drowning, feeling empty and lost
But me, I'm no better, she wants to fuck around and I let her
A culture now of ""we're together,"" but was never together‚Äã
I know you're lookin' for one-night, and I've been stuck on forevers
I think it's sad that I'm naive to think that we could do better, but fuck it
‚ÄãI should've known from the start
And even after all this time, I still don't know who you are
‚ÄãThere's more to life than likes and hoppin' bars, and gettin' high inside your car
You're feelin' distant, feeling far, your wall is up, I know it's hard, and so

[Chorus: Tori Solkowski]
Tell me somethin' only you know
Give me reason not to go
You have my heart, if I have yours, then let me know
And tell me somethin' only you know
You have feelings you don't show
So how am I supposed to know?
If you love me, let me know
Let me know
Let me know

[Verse 2: Witt Lowry]
I often wonder what really it is that I offer you
At least you feel my touch, even if it's just when I walk on you
My mind is always elsewhere, it's there, it's on, then it's off of you
You want to feel my depth, but my heart is deaf when I talk to you
A viscous game that we play
See, nowadays, they say love and hate are one and the same
‚ÄãYou let me beat around the bush until you're sick of my games‚Äã
‚ÄãIt's never fair because you care and I just transfer the blame
I transfer my pain, a shame to know that you could do better
‚ÄãHow selfish, is it my concern as if I'm makin' you wetter
How selfish, is it you just want me 'cause I make you feel better
And we just chop it up to bein' drunk, there's wine on your sweater
Alone, but together, we always make it less than it seems
It's funny how if you have feelin's, you're weak, so we say less than we mean
You hate waitin', we're not datin' and not vocal
We're game-playin', I hate sayin', but still hopeful
I'm conflicted, I'm lost in a lot of women
I know our situation's been sticky since the beginnin'
She left me out in limbo, you deal with my indecision
Don't know if you'll ever love me or love the talent I'm given, but fuck it
I should've known from the start
How can I feel so fuckin' lonely with your hands on my heart?
Your hands on my chest, you whisper, ""What do you want to do next?""
Our generation's taken love out of sex, and so the question is left

[Chorus: Tori Solkowski]
Tell me somethin' only you know
Give me reason not to go
You have my heart, if I have yours, then let me know
And tell me somethin' only you know
You have feelings you don't show
So how am I supposed to know?
If you love me, let me know

Coconut oil, tanning se√±oritas

But there is one thing that I haven't done

251,Millennium,"Ey!

[Part 1]
Ja, ich tick' hochqualitatives Kokain an Gs
Es ist der Boss, der auch mit arabischen Gro√üfamilien dealt
Ich kauf' E-Pills auf Hollandreisen
Und seit ich aus Umweltschutzgr√ºnden nicht mehr mit √ñl heize, nehme ich Dollarscheine
Yeah, Punkbitch, was?
Ich verbrenne die Kohle nur damit mein Kontostand endlich wieder in den Taschenrechner passt
Sieh, ich hustel' H im Club
Deine Crewmember fragen, warum ich ihre M√ºtter fick', und ich sage, das lenkt mich von meinem Waffenfetisch ab
Ich tick' Speed in dem Club an die Bitches am Dancefloor, fahr' vor deinem Haus in 'nem silbernen Benz vor
Biegt der Boss im Anzug von Armani dann bei Sonnenuntergang in deine Street ein, rennt deine Gang fort
Ich bekomme von deiner Schwester Fanpost, aber gebe keine Beachtung
Ich komme dir entgegen, du Bitch wirst blass und f√§llst zu Boden nach paar Shots aus der Magnum
Also was, du Clown? Wenn der aus dem Kofferraum stoffverkaufende Boss auftaucht
Laufe nach Haus oder staune geschockt mit offenem Maul in den Shotgunlauf
Versteck dich! Ich komm' sakkotragend an deine Schule, geh' da die Magnum laden
Baller' dir paar Kugeln in den Head, Bitch, und du machst Backflips wie Akrobaten

[Hook]
Die Sommer sind k√§lter, die Stra√üen sind dunkler
Und ich bin hier der Boss im 21. Jahrhundert
Yeah, ich pump' deine Freunde voll Blei
Zieh die Schutzweste an, Bitch, die 90er sind vorbei
Die Sommer sind k√§lter, die Stra√üen sind dunkler
Und ich bin hier der Boss im 21. Jahrhundert
Yeah, ich pump' deine Freunde voll Blei
Zieh die Schutzweste an, Bitch, die 90er sind vorbei

[Part 2]
Ich geh' Rauschgift verticken, yeah
Ehrliches Geld ist wie dieser Wind-of-Change-Song ‚Äì darauf wird gepfiffen
Und du kriegst die Krise, denn ich hab' ziemlich viele
Pelze aus Fellen deiner Lieblingstiere
Du fragst dich, was sollst du gegen all den Frust unternehm'n?
Den Hoodboss hingegen plagen nur noch Luxusprobleme
Zum Beispiel: Wie kann er beim Bankdr√ºcken mit durch f√ºnfzig Goldketten
Eingeschr√§nkter Bewegungsfreiheit denn noch effektiv seine Brustmuskeln st√§hl'n?
Und ich cruis' im schwarzen Mercedes AMG durch starken Regen in Hafenn√§he
Fahre durch Gegenden, in denen Huren abends stehen
Huren und hagere M√§dchen, die gerade so eben genug haben zum Leben
Strahlen und geben mir ungefragt die Moneten, w√ºnschen gute Fahrt und gehen
Ich trag' Armani, mein Schneider ist ein Italiener
Deiner ist ein Thail√§nder wie Sankt Martin
Der Boss, der deine Bodyguards totschie√üt und mit Dopedeals
Money macht so wie das Ice-Age-Animationsteam, ist jetzt back

[Hook]
Die Sommer sind k√§lter, die Stra√üen sind dunkler
Und ich bin hier der Boss im 21. Jahrhundert
Yeah, ich pump' deine Freunde voll Blei
Zieh die Schutzweste an, Bitch, die 90er sind vorbei
Die Sommer sind k√§lter, die Stra√üen sind dunkler
Und ich bin hier der Boss im 21. Jahrhundert
Yeah, ich pump' deine Freunde voll Blei
Zieh die Schutzweste an, Bitch, die 90er sind vorbei

[Bridge]
Ey, jetzt wird wieder Kokain vertickt
An multikulturelle Stra√üen-Gs, die j√ºnger sind als ich
Und mein Stiefvater fragt, wozu ich das Messer brauch'
Ich sag', das ist nicht wie damals, heut geh'n sie gleich mit Messern drauf, yeah

[Hook]
Die Sommer sind k√§lter, die Stra√üen sind dunkler
Und ich bin hier der Boss im 21. Jahrhundert

You say you love me
But at one time you loved him
So what's so different?
Tell me if you were in my shoes
What would you do or think of me?
Would you trust me?

But you feeding me all this rap about
How it's different
But it's not mentioned what you're doin' is wicked
Now I'm having second thoughts about you and me
Cuz this not how I want it or it should be

You say you want my trust and
Told me you were leavin'
How am I to know that you won't do it to me?
You're tellin' me it's different
But what the hell is different?
If you cheated on him you'll do it to me

You're creepin' on him for me
But you say ""just trust me""
How am I to know that you won't do it to me?
You're tellin' me it's different
But what the hell is different?
If you cheated on him you'll do it to me

Like the saying goes, you reap what you sow
And what goes around comes back around
To you five times harder
And I'm pretty sure that he's thinkin'
That you're totally his
But you're here in my rimmed-up drop top wit me
All hugged up and all over me
Kissin' all of me
Is that to get me where you want me to be?
Don't want this to happen to me
So I'll drop you off, go back to your man

Or is it just that
You wanna get even

He comes in an hour early just to beat the morning crowd
He stares out the window and stirs his coffee cup
Another day, another dollar short of catching up

But in his heart, he knows what it brings

With the hands of a working man

Down at the factory, standing in line
He waits to punch the time clock
A million worries on his mind
Oh, Jimmy's needing braces
And Betty's needing time
And the problems that he's facing
They're all building up inside

Same old job and same old dull routine

You're my only girl
I'm not the only one that holds you
I never ever should have told you
You're my only world

Just think how long I've known you
It's wrong for me to own you, lock and key
It's really not confusing
I'm just the young illusion, can't you see

I never ever should have told you
You're my only girl
I'm not the only one that holds you
I never ever should have told you
You're my only world

Would you ride then, if I wasn't driving
If I wasn't a, eight-figure nigga by the name of Jigga
Would you come around me or would you clown me
If I couldn't flow futuristic, would ya
Put your two lips on my wood and kiss it, could ya
See yourself with a nigga working harder than nine to five
Ten to six, two jobs to survive, or

267,All Night Long,"[Verse 1]
Ay yo
This that shit you bob your head to
This that brand new instrumental
I heard he puts his city on
That boy Kells so influential
Success got everybody hating
Success to me is inspiration
Cause how we supposed to know that what we dream is possible
If don't nobody that looks like us makes it?
You only got one life, don't waste it
I mean we only got one night, get wasted
I mean I know you're trying to think it out
But go with what you feel cause real problems can't be calculated
It's hard to find the answer when they have no explanation
It's hard to find where you're headed when there's no destination
It's hard to know when we're going when there's no expiration
So until that day, just keep that Kells inside your playlist and

[Hook]
Bring those speakers up on blast, play it all night long
Bring those speakers up on blast, play it all night long
Bring those speakers up on blast, play it all night long
Bring those speakers up on blast, play it all night long

[Verse 2]
Drinking whiskey like a desperado
My bitches drinking Reposado
Ashing in an empty bottle
Listening to the songs that put our asses in this empty condo
Remember ridin' 'round in Ashleigh's car though?
When the radio first played our song though?
Or at her house when MTV first showed my face
That clip was crazy, I swear it felt like we won the lotto
But a million bucks can't buy priceless moments
An a million people may not know us
But every one of us wants this gift we own
And that is: how is how to keep it real
How to never judge somebody by their steering wheel
Cause you know that mother fucker in that Ford Taurus
Could be the next mother fucker in that new Porsche
But like I said it's hard to know where you're headed
When there's no destination
So until that day, just keep that Kells inside your playlist and

Bring those speakers up on blast, play it all night long
Bring those speakers up on blast, play it all night long
Bring those speakers up on blast, play it all night long

This shit right here, man, this shit feels right! Aye Dub! Aye Dre! Aye Irv! you know it‚Äôs all year right? Hah! I'm sitting here in the middle of New York City, the night before I gotta turn my second album in, higher than a motherfucka, drunker than a motherfucka, with my boys, and I‚Äôm thinking, damn, man 5 years ago, we were dead broke chilling in Cleveland everyday, and the next thing you know, people are calling us about record deals. And you know, the crazy part is, Ashleigh rented this white Nissan Altima for me and Slim so we could drive out to New York. I think she had to some work some shit or something, so she couldn‚Äôt go so we were gonna go out there and see what these labels were talking about. And I‚Äôm driving us there, but my license‚Äôs suspended so I tell Slim, I'm like ‚ÄúYo, I gotta pull up before we get to New York and switch, so you can drive in case we get pulled over"" cause we got pulled over the last time we went there. But you know, he had a license so it made sense for him to drive so cut to like 7 and a half hours later, I'm pulling over in this emergency lane and right as I‚Äôm opening the door to switch with Slim, boom! This fucking car going full speed on the highway swerves off the road and smashed into us. Yo, I swear to God I woke up half my body‚Äôs laying outside the car in the ditch, like 15-20 feet away from where we just were. The car was totalled, the windows were smashed, it was cold as fuck, it was raining outside, but we were actually okay. I mean, my boy had to go the hospital you know the ambulance came and shit, he ended up being alright, but our meeting‚Äôs with the record label started at 2 and we didn‚Äôt have no car, and now we were stuck in a fucking hospital in New Jersey. So this dude that, I ended up partnering with later on, his name‚Äôs James McMillan, he comes and gets us to these meetings and shit, somehow, someway. I don‚Äôt know if it was just because we just got into a crazy car crash and could‚Äôve died a couple of hours ago but I'm in there and like you know I‚Äôm not feeling this shit man I‚Äôm not feeling this record label shit and we drove back to Cleveland. Now I'm back in Ashleigh's mom's basement, I'm thinking about life, you know, I'm on a shit ton of vicodin cause the doctors at the hospital you know gave us something cause we got into that car accident and Ashleigh runs downstairs and she‚Äôs like ‚ÄúYo, yo, Kells, Kells, you're not gonna believe who wants to talk to you right now."" I‚Äôm like, ""who?‚Äù She‚Äôs like ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs gonna call you in 30 seconds."" Now I guess, when I was in New York, I had made some kinda noise cause this dude named Byron who ended up becoming my manager later on took this video I had called ‚ÄúChip off the Block‚Äù over to Bad Boy and showed Harve Pierre and Harve Pierre went and showed that vid to a guy named Puff, so I answer my phone, depressed, down, fucked up on vicodin and I hear: ‚ÄúPlease hold, I have Mister Sean Combs for you."" I said, god damn, life‚Äôs about to change, man, I felt it. And sometimes thats all it takes, it‚Äôs just that feeling you know what I mean. I knew I was gonna be here, and now I‚Äôm here

To temper the bitterness and loss
Though what you say is true
This might be it for me and you
Maybe we can draw that line
Maybe another time

Well I want to do what's right
But maybe not tonight

Memories of another town
Those pretty eyes, that pretty frown
In the long grass where we lay
And let the whole world fall away
And though in time we've walked apart
You were always in my heart
Maybe we should say goodbye
But maybe not tonight

I remember you were just a child
Burning brightly and running wild
We married on an August night
No priest, no church, just a big moon shining bright
Maybe we should be moving on
And figure what is done is done
Maybe we should break those vows
Aw, but maybe not right now

Maybe we should do what's right
Maybe not tonight
Maybe we should both just do what's right

[Intro: Nas and Puff Daddy]
Escobar Season has returned
It's been a long time, been a long time comin'
It's life or death for me now
But you know, there's no turnin' back now
This is what makes me, this is what I am
Feel me? Let's go

[Chorus 1: Puff Daddy and Nas]
You can hate me now, (Q.B.)
But I won't stop now (Real niggas)
'Cause I can't stop now, (Bravehearts)
You can hate me now (C'mon)
But I won't stop now
'Cause I can't stop now
You can hate me now
You can hate me now

[Ad-lib over Chorus: Puff Daddy (Nas)]
Well, you hate me, I'm gon' hate you too
It's as simple as that
Die motherfucker, die motherfucker, die!
You don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
Go down any way you want it to go down (do it now)
Weak, jealous motherfuckers! (do it now, do it now)
Fuck y'all!

[Verse 1: Nas]
Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy
Ice that I wear, flows that I try
Close your eyes, picture me rollin', Sixes, money foldin'
Bitches, honeys that swollen to riches, Nas get in ya
Most critically acclaimed Pulitzer Prize winner
Best storyteller, thug narrator, my style's greater
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters
Commentators ringside try watchin' my paper
Almost a decade, quite impressive
Most of the best is in the essence for this rap shit that I stand for
Expandin' more to the big screen, Bill Gates dreams
But it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens
Want me off the scene fast, but good things last
Like your favorite MC still makin' some mean cash
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque back to the projects
But you still wanna hate, be my guest, I suggest

[Ad-libs: Puff Daddy]
Money is power, motherfucker!
I got millions of thugs on salary

[Chorus 2: Puff Daddy]
You can hate me now, (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (I can't stop)

But I won't stop now (You can hate me now)
'Cause I can't stop now (You can hate me now)
You can hate me now
You can hate me now

[Ad-Libs: Nas and Puff Daddy]
Do it now! I told you, do it now!
Let's go

[Verse 2: Nas]
You wanna hate me, then hate me; what can I do
But keep gettin' money? Funny, I was just like you
I had to hustle hard, never give up, until I made it
Now y'all sayin': ""That's a clever nigga, nothin' to play with.""
Hate on me, I blew but I'm the same OG
People warn me, when you're on top there's envy
Took my niggas out the hood, but you doubt on us
Sayin' we left the hood but can't get it out of us
My bad, should I step out my shoes, give 'em to you?
Here's my cars and my house, you can live in that too
Criticize when I flow for the streets, hate my dress code
Gucci this, Fendi that ‚Äì what you expect, ho?
Nickname Esco, took this game to its threshold
Best flow, I bet the whole U.S. know
Try to make it like you the realest, but who the illest?
Think we all know the answer to that, 'cause niggas feel this, right?

[Ad-libs: Puff Daddy]
You think I'ma come this far
And let you niggas stop me now?
I hate you too!

[Chorus 2: Puff Daddy]
You can hate me now, (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (I can't stop)
'Cause I can't stop now, (You can hate me)
You can hate me now (I hate you too)
But I won't stop now (You can hate me now)
'Cause I can't stop now (You can hate me now)
You can hate me now
You can hate me now

[Ad-libs: Puff Daddy]
I like this, I like the way this feels

[Verse 3: Nas]
It's a thin line between paper and hate
Friends and snakes, nine milli's and thirty-eights
Hell or the Pearly Gates; I was destined to come
Predicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs
Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows
Shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one
Took a little time to claim my spot
Chairman of the board until this game stop, and I side with the Lord
Ride for the cause while drivin' niggas shot at my doors
Plottin' I'm sure, to catch me with they Glocks to my jaws
Tried stickin' me up, but I flipped on these ducks
Instead of me, ambulances were pickin' them up
Niggas fear what they don't understand
Hate what they can't conquer, guess it's just the theory of man
Became a monster, on top of the world, never fallin'
I'm as real as they come, from day one, forever ballin', c'mon!

[Ad-libs: Puff Daddy]
You ain't never seen a nigga like me ever in your life
And that's what you can't understand!

[Chorus 2: Puff Daddy]
You can hate me now, (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (I can't stop)
'Cause I can't stop now, (You can hate me)
You can hate me now (I hate you too)
But I won't stop now (You can hate me now)
'Cause I can't stop now (You can hate me now)
You can hate me now
You can hate me now

Heaven knows that I've been told
Paid for the life that I chose
If I could, I'd trade it all

It could all be so simple (Ba-ba-ba-baby, baby, baby)
But you'd rather make it hard (Huh, uh)
Loving you is like a battle (It's like a battle)
And we both end up with scars
Tell me who I have to be (Who I have to be)
To get some reciprocity
See, no one loves you more than me (More than me)
And no one ever will (No one ever will, yeah)
Is this just a silly game (Silly game)
That forces you to act this way? (To act this way)
Forces you to scream my name

I keep letting you back in (You back in)
How can I explain myself? (I don't understand why)
As painful as this thing has been
I just can't be with no one else
See I know what we've got to do (Yeah)
You let go (You let go), and I'll let go too (And I'll let go)
Cause no one's hurt me more than you (No one's hurt me more than you)
And no one ever will

Who's your daddy?
Daddy, what are you doing?

I'm goin' to hell! Who's comin' with me?
Somebody, please help him!

[Verse 1: Eminem, Hailie Jade & Dr. Dre]
There's no mountain I can't climb
There's no tower too high, no plane that I can't learn how to fly
What do I gotta do to get through to you
To show you there ain't nothin' I can't take this chainsaw to?
(Rahhnnn!) Fuckin' brains, brawn and brass balls
I cut 'em off and got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
Inside of a hall, with my framed autographed sunglasses
With Elton John's name on my drag wall
I'm out the closet, I've been lyin' my ass off
All this time, me and Dre been fuckin' with hats off
(Suck it, Marshall!) So tell Laura and her husband to back off
'Fore I push this motherfuckin' button and blast off
And launch one of these Russians, and that's all
Blow every fuckin' thing except Afghanistan on the map off
When will it stop? When will I knock the crap off?

""Rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana and codeine and
Goddamn it, you little motherfucker
If you ain't got nothin' nice to say, then don't say nothin'!""
Uh‚Ä¶ Fuck that shit, bitch!
Eat a motherfuckin' dick, chew on a prick
And lick a million motherfuckin' cocks per second
I'd rather put out a motherfuckin' gospel record
I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch
Eat pussy and have pussy lips glued to my face
With a clit ring in my nose, than quit bringin' my flows
Quit givin' me my ammo; can't you see why I'm so mean?
If y'all leave me alone this wouldn't be my M.O.
I wouldn't have to go eenee-meenee-meini-mo
Catch a homo by his toe, man, I don't know no more
Am I the only fuckin' one who's normal anymore? (Dad!)

My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise
At the same time, can make you dry your eyes
With the same rhyme, see, what you're seein'
Is a genius at work, which to me isn't work
So it's easy to misinterpret it at first, ‚Äòcause when I speak
It's tongue-in-cheek, I'd yank my fuckin' teeth
Before I'd ever bite my tongue, I'd slice my gums
Get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once
And die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on
And kicked and hit with shit every time I sung
Like R. Kelly as soon as ""Bump and Grind"" comes on
More pain inside of my brain, than the eyes of a little girl
Inside of a plane aimed at the World Trade
Standin' on Ronnie's grave, screamin' at the sky
'Til clouds gather; it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade
And that's pretty much the gist of it
Parents are pissed, but the kids love it
9 millimeter heaters stashed in two-seaters with meat cleavers
I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither

Dance a little jig and a stomp by the fire

Together again

Seen things they can't know

Got everybody but you telling me what to do

[Chorus]
But I been down so long
Oh, it can't be longer still
I been down so long
That the end must be drawin' near

[Verse 2]
Look to everybody but me to answer my prayers
'Til I saw an angel in a bathroom
Who said she saw no one worth saving anywhere
Blind man on the corner said it's simple
Like flipping a coin
Don't matter what side it lands on
If it's someone else's dime

[Chorus]
But I been down so long
Oh, it can't be longer still
I been down so long
That the end must be drawin' near

[Bridge]
I take a trip, I catch a train, I catch a plane
I got a ticket in my hand
And then a fat man takes my money
And like cattle we all stand

But we been down so long
Oh, it can't be longer still
We been down so long
The end must be...
Oh, I know the end must be...
Oh, I know the end must be drawin' near",Jewel,1999,"[67, 59, 59, 64, 71, 82]",6

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Motherfuckers wanna act loco, hit 'em up
Numerous shots with the fo'-fo'
Faggots wanna talk to Po-Po's, smoke 'em like cocoa
Fuck rap, coke by the boatload
Fuck that, on the run-by, gun high, one eye closed
Left holes through some guy clothes
Stop your bullshittin, Glock with the full clip
Motherfuckers better duck when the fool spit
One shot could make a nigga do a full flip
See the nigga laying shocked when the fool hit
Hey ma, how you, know niggas wanna buy you
But see me I wanna ""Fuck for Free"" like Akinyele
Take this ride, make you feel it inside your belly
If it's tight get the K-Y Jelly
All night get you wide up inside the telly
Side to side, til you say Jay-Z you're too much for me

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I am, a little bit of loneliness, a little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints but I can't help the fact
That everybody can see these scars
I am, what I want you to want, what I want you to feel
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
To just believe this is real
So I, let go, watching you, turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here cause you're all that I've got

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Got a condo with nothin but condoms in it
The same place where the rhymes is invented
So all I do is rap and sex, imagine how I stroke
See how I was flowin on my last cassette?
Rapid-fire like I'm blastin a Tec, never jam though
Never get high, never run out of ammo
Niggas hatin the shit cause I slayed your bitch
You know your favorite, I know it made you sick
And now you're, actin raw but you never had war
Don't know how to carry your hoes, wanna marry your ho
Now she's mad at me cause Your Majesty
Just happened to be a pimp - what a tragedy
She wanted, us to end, cause I fucked with friends
She gave me one more chance and I fucked her again
I seen her tears as she busted in, I said, ""Shit
There's a draft, shut the door bitch and come on in!""

[Verse 4: Mike Shinoda]
I am, a little bit insecure, a little unconfident
Cuz you don't understand I do what I can
Sometimes I don't make sense
I am, what you never wanna say, but I've never had a doubt
It's like no matter what I do I can't convince you for once just to hear me out
So I, let go, watching you, turn your back like you always do
You face away and pretend that I'm not
I'll be here cause you're all that I've got

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel, the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal, this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored

Now, hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me like it or not
Right now, hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me like it or not
Right now

I can't feel, the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored

I can't feel, the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal, this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored

Don't turn your back on me

Don't turn your back on me

284,Everytime I Cry,"You call and wake me up, the way you always do
Say you miss me and you're sorry, d√©j√† vu
You push the button in the heart you know so well
The wall starts coming down then I remind myself

Everytime I think you might have changed
Put aside the anger and the blame
Make myself believe that there's a way to work it out
Everytime you say let's try again
Begging me to let you back in
Everytime I do, everytime you lie, everytime I cry

If only promises could just erase the past
I could open up my heart enough to take you back
But we've been down that road time and time again
I've learned the hard way how the story always ends

Everytime I think you might have changed
Put aside the anger and the blame
Make myself believe that there's a way to work it out
Everytime you say let's try again
Begging me to let you back in
Everytime I do, everytime you lie, everytime I cry

Everytime I think you might have changed
Put aside the anger and the blame

On the side of the train tracks, down by me
And it made me angry with no fury
A sight for sore eyes to see
But have you got any smiling left for me
'Cause I'm feeling left out
Like a drunken thug who missed a clouting in a fight
Everybody's asking where's the black eye?

[Verse 2]
And I'm faithfully alone again
Left alone in this big old bed
Thrashing about like a toothless shark in cotton waves
And I'm faithfully alone again
Left alone in this big old bed
Thrashing about like a toothless shark in cotton waves
Like a wicked child left to fend in the wilderness
But I was taken in by the wolves
Taught me how to howl at the moon

When I'm well-known for being aloof
Oh, if I was cursed, then I guess that we were cursed too

Well go'head and leave
The call heard around the world from the wives of MCs
These cats is paying more than half a pound
My garment bag'll snatch it down
Ain't got the skate, but we can probably run it back in town
Scenarios like this is tear jerkers
For the modern emcee, ie. the blue collar worker
Cause this thing called rhyming, no different from coal mining
We both on assignment, to unearth the diamond
While you start climbing in 'em, I start shining
You be struggling and striving
And they think you prime timing
Maintain and keep silent
Make note and observation
This confrontation
This is the daily operation
My concentration
Stay focused on my recitation
Bout to reach my destination
With no pause or hesitation
Baby make the preparation
Cause this ain't no recreation
This is pro-ball
And we lettin' you know y'all
At the show y'all
Doing this for dough y'all

But God willing I'll be back home
To drop these heavy ass bags up off my back bone
Around the world with a catalogue of rap songs
My baby girl is walking, been away for that long
But no you haven't well at least that's how it seem to me
My hometown is like a whole different scenery
The old timers on the stoop leaning leisurely
The new jacks up in the parks smoking greenery
Easily take it for granted when you up in it
But it's sweet scented, when you been down for a minute
Move around city limits, break 'em down with the vinitage
The inovinin', classical b-boy image
Collect the winnings
Cause it the reason that we came here
This thing is not a game here
The fortune not the fame here
From New York to the Cackalacks
Cali and the Cadillacs
Chicago no we innovate
Infiltrate Virginia state
DC make me stimulate
Philly know we penetrate
Georgia make us generate
Let's set a date to get the papes
They celebrate to my jams in foreign lands
Even your mans in Japan know who I am
Mina-san, make everybody out in Nippon
Say ichiban, me God man bo where you hitting from

Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow (And I)
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick (Ah)
I won't even stay awake to

Holding on to me so tight (Ooh)

So brightly everywhere (So brightly, baby)
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air (Oh, oh yeah)
And everyone is singing (Oh yeah)
I hear those sleigh bells ringing (Oh)
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh, oh)
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

[Verse 3]
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for (Ah)
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door

[Chorus]
Oh, I just want you for my own (Ooh)
More than you could ever know (Ooh)
Make my wish come true
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you

You, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (You)

Not to kiss you over, under
Feel you inside, feel my thunder

Girl it don't have to be a thang
I'll wait for you, You wait for me (Baby)

We don't have to rush at all (Baby yeah)

These are the times we all wish for
The moment when less means so much more

We can make love or not at all

Be thinking 'bout you all the time
Morning, noon, and supper time, baby
Tear you up in little pieces
Swallow you like reese's pieces

295,When A Woman's Fed Up,"[Verse 1]
I'm standing here looking in the mirror
Saying ""damn"" to myself
I should have known the day would come
That she would find somebody else
And all the things I took her through
Shit, I shouldn't have lasted this long
Now I'm at this telephone booth calling Tyrone

[Chorus]
'Cause when a woman's fed up
(No matter how you beg, no)
It ain't nothing you can do about it
(Nothing you can do about it)
It's like running out of love
(No matter what you say, no)
And then it's too late to talk about it
(Too late to talk about it)

[Verse 2]
Now let's talk about how it all goes down
I used to make love to you daily
When the night fell the same
And anytime that you were hurt
I could feel your pain
And if I had a dollar
It was yours, yeah
And whenever we would go out
I would front the bill
But now the up is down
And the silence is sound
I hurt you too too many times
Now I can't come around

[Chorus]
'Cause when a woman's fed up
(No matter how you beg, no)
It ain't nothing you can do about it
Nothing you can do about it
It's like running out of love

Then listen to this song while the record plays

'Cause when a woman's fed up
(No matter how you beg, no)
Mama taught me a long time ago
It ain't nothing you can do about it
Nothing you can do about it (Oh no, oh no)
It's like running out of love
(No matter what you say, no)
And then it's too late to talk about it
(Too late to talk about it)

[Outro] (throughout repeating chorus)
""You can cry a river
'Til an ocean starts to form, yeah
But she will always remember
'Cause she's a woman scorned
And if you ever get her back
It will never be the same
She's cuttin' the corners of her eyes
Every time she see your face
Now your trust is out the door
She don't want you no more
You used to tell your boys, not me
And she would always be there for you
If you had took the time to see
What that woman meant to you""
Is what the mirror said to me, whoa
She was raised in Illinois
Right outside of Chicago

296,Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen),"[Spoken: Lee Perry]
Ladies and Gentlemen of the class of ‚Äô97:

Wear sunscreen. If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it. The long term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience. I will dispense this advice now

Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth; or never mind. You will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they have faded. But trust me, in 20 years you‚Äôll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can‚Äôt grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked. You are not as fat as you imagine

Don‚Äôt worry about the future; or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing
Bubblegum. The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that
Never crossed your worried mind; the kind that blindside you at 4 PM on some idle Tuesday

Do one thing every day that scares you

Sing

Don‚Äôt be reckless with other people‚Äôs hearts; don‚Äôt put up with people who are reckless with yours

Floss

Don‚Äôt waste your time on jealousy; sometimes you‚Äôre ahead, sometimes you‚Äôre behind. The race is long, and in the end, it‚Äôs only with yourself

Remember the compliments you receive; forget the insults. If you succeed in doing this, tell me how

Keep your old love letters. Throw away your old bank statements

Stretch

Don‚Äôt feel guilty if you don‚Äôt know what you want to do with your
Life. The most interesting people I know didn‚Äôt know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives. Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don‚Äôt

Get plenty of calcium

Be kind to your knees, you‚Äôll miss them when they‚Äôre gone

Maybe you‚Äôll marry, maybe you won‚Äôt
Maybe you‚Äôll have children, maybe you won‚Äôt
Maybe you‚Äôll divorce at 40
Maybe you‚Äôll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary
Whatever you do, don‚Äôt congratulate yourself too much, or berate yourself either. Your choices are half chance; so are everybody else‚Äôs

Enjoy your body. Use it every way you can. Don‚Äôt be afraid of it, or what other people think of it. It‚Äôs the greatest instrument you‚Äôll ever own

Dance, even if you have nowhere to do it but in your own living room

Read the directions, even if you don‚Äôt follow them

Do not read beauty magazines; they will only make you feel ugly

[Hook]
Brother and sister
Together, we'll make it through
Someday our spirits
Will take you and guide you there
I know you've been hurting
But I've been waiting to be there for you
And I'll be there just helping you out
Whenever I can

Get to know your parents; you never know when they‚Äôll be gone for good

Be nice to your siblings; they are your best link to your past and the
People most likely to stick with you in the future

Understand that friends come and go, but for the precious few you
Should hold on

Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle, because the older you get, the more you need the people you knew when you were young

Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard

Live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft

Travel

Accept certain inalienable truths: prices will rise, politicians will philander, you too will get old-- and when you do, you‚Äôll fantasize that when you were young prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders

Respect your elders

Don‚Äôt expect anyone else to support you

Maybe you have a trust fund, maybe you have a wealthy spouse; but you never know when either one might run out

Don‚Äôt mess too much with your hair, or by the time you're 40, it will look 85

Be careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it
Advice is a form of nostalgia. Dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it‚Äôs worth

But trust me on the sunscreen

[Hook]
Brother and sister
Together, we'll make it through
Someday our spirits
Will take you and guide you there
I know you've been hurting
But I've been waiting to be there for you
And I'll be there just helping you out
Whenever I can

All I ever needed was her right here loving me
For a while we were cool and the groovin' love was on
But I still remember how it felt when our love was gone

In a tattered picture book
Was a photograph she took years ago

Faded pictures in a broken glass (broken glass)
Like a mirror revealing (I see... I see)
What the woman is feeling
Was it someone from a distant past? (way back long ago)
'Cause it's breaking my heart
To watch her stare into the glass (Joe help me out!)

[Verse 2: Joe]
As she turned through the pages the tears rolled down her face
I could see her reminiscing, why her life had to be this way
Then she stopped and she came to a page where her diary ends
To smell the scent of an old rose, from her lover I suppose

In a tattered picture book (tattered picture book)
Was a photograph she took (she took) years ago

How can I maintain with that shit on my brain?

My niggas is with it, you want it come and get it
Took it then we split it, you fuckin' right we did it
What the fuck you gon' do when we run up on you?

Don't know what we're goin' through
I'ma have to show niggas how easily we blow niggas
When you find out there's some mo' niggas

Then you don't know me, money
It's about to get ugly, fuck it, dawg, I'm hungry
I guess you know what that mean
Come up off that green, rob niggas on ravine
Don't make it a murder scene
Give a dog a bone, leave a dog alone
Let a dog roam and he'll find his way home
Home of the brave, my home is a cage
Ayo I'ma slave till my home is a grave
I'ma pull capers, it's all about the papers
Bitches caught the vapors and now they wanna rape us

What was that look for when I walked in the door?
Oh, you thought you was raw? BOOM! Not anymore

Met a bad bitch that‚Äôll cut all night
That‚Äôll suck all night, you just cut off lights
Almost missed my flight
Tryna get my last little nut, all right?
She be down for whatever
Whenever I wanna get up in the guts, all right?
Never fuss or fight
On the grind, tryna find this lettuce
I love it when you give me head
I hate it when you give me headaches

She said, ‚ÄúI heard you got a main chick
A mistress and some hoes

And carry fo‚Äô-fives, like change for a twenty
So what I look like, scurred?

Never mind that, girl, let‚Äôs make a track

302,Have You Ever?,"[Chorus]
Have you ever loved somebody
So much it makes you cry
Have you ever needed something
So bad you can't sleep at night
Have you ever tried to find the words
But they don't come out right
Have you ever, have you ever

[Verse 1]
Have you ever been in love
Been in love so bad
You'd do anything to make them understand
Have you ever had someone steal your heart away
You'd give anything to make them feel the same
Have you ever searched for words to get you in their heart
But you don't know what to say
And you don't know where to start

[Chorus]
Have you ever loved somebody
So much it makes you cry
Have you ever needed something
So bad you can't sleep at night
Have you ever tried to find the words
But they don't come out right
Have you ever, have you ever

[Verse 2]
Have you ever found the one
You've dreamed of all of your life
You'd do just about anything to look into their eyes
Have you finally found the one you've given your heart to
Only to find that one won't give their heart to you
Have you ever closed your eyes and
Dreamed that they were there
And all you can do is wait for the day when they will care

[Chorus]
Have you ever loved somebody
So much it makes you cry
Have you ever needed something
So bad you can't sleep at night
Have you ever tried to find the words
But they don't come out right
Have you ever, have you ever

[Bridge]
What do I gotta do to get you in my arms baby
What do I gotta say to get to your heart
To make you understand how I need you next to me
Gotta get you in my world
Cause baby I can't sleep

[Chorus]
Have you ever loved somebody
So much it makes you cry
Have you ever needed something
So bad you can't sleep at night
Have you ever tried to find the words
But they don't come out right
Have you ever, have you ever

Have you ever loved somebody
So much it makes you cry
Have you ever needed something
So bad you can't sleep at night (just can't sleep at night )
Have you ever tried to find the words
But they don't come out right
Have you ever, have you ever, ever, ever

303,(God Must Have Spent) A Little More Time On You,"[Verse 1: Justin]
Can this be true? Tell me, can this be real?
How can I put into words what I feel?
My life was complete, I thought I was whole
Why do I feel like I'm losing control?

[Pre-Chorus: Justin]
Never thought that love could feel like this
And you've changed my world with just one kiss
How can it be that right here with me
There's an angel? It's a miracle

[Chorus: All (w/ Justin)]
Your love is like a river: peaceful and deep
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep
When I look into your eyes, I know that it's true
God must have spent a little more time on you
(A little more time, yes he did, baby)

[Verse 2: JC]
In all of creation, all things great and small
You are the one that surpasses them all
More precious than any diamond or pearl
They broke the mold when you came in this world

[Pre-Chorus: JC]
And I'm trying hard to figure out
Just how I ever did without
The warmth of your smile, the heart of a child
That's deep inside
Leaves me purified

[Chorus (w/ JC)]
Your love is like a river: peaceful and deep (and deep)
Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep

I could stay awake just to hear you breathin'

Don't want to close my eyes
I don't want to fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you (even when I dream)
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, babe
And I don't want to miss a thing

Lying close to you feeling your heart beating

Wonderin' if it's me you're seeing

Live from Bedford-Stuyvesant, the livest one
Representing BK to the fullest
Gats, I pull it
Bastards ducking when B.I.G. be bucking
Chickenheads be clucking, in my back room fucking
It ain't nothing
They know B.I.G. be handling
With the MAC in the Ac' door paneling
Bandaging MC's, oxygen, they can't breathe
Mad tricks up the sleeve
Wear boxers so my dick can breathe
Breeze through in the Q
Forty-five by my side, lyrical high
And those that rushes my clutches get put on crutches
Get smoked like Dutches from the master
Hate to blast ya but I have to
You see I smoke a lot

Hunt me or be hunted

To simmer saut√©, I'm the winner all day

Leave no witnesses, what you think this is?
Ain't no amateurs here

One thousand grams of uncut to the gut
It seems fucked up, the way I touched up the grill
Trying to play gorilla when you ain't no killer

Get ready to die, tell God I said hi

Wake up, kids, you've got the dreamers disease

You cannot find the light (light)

But when the night is falling
You cannot find a friend (friend)
You feel your tree is breaking just then

[Chorus]
You've got the music in you
Don't let go, you've got the music in you
One dance left, this world is gonna pull through
Don't give up, you've got a reason to live
Can't forget, we only get what we give

[Verse 3]
This whole damn world could fall apart
You'll be okay, follow your heart
You're in harm's way, I'm right behind
Now say you're mine

[Chorus]
You've got the music in you
Don't let go, you've got the music in you
One dance left, this world is gonna pull through
Don't give up, you've got a reason to live
Can't forget, we only get what we give
Don't let go, I feel the music in you
You, you, you

[Post-Chorus]
Fly high
What's real can't die
You only get what you give
You're gonna get what you give
Don't give up, just don't be afraid to leave

[Bridge]
Health insurance, rip-off flying
FDA, big bankers buying
Fake computer crashes dining
Cloning while they're multiplying
Fashion shoots with Beck and Hanson
Courtney Love and Marilyn Manson
You're all fakes, run to your mansions
Come around, we'll kick your asses!

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? (Excuse me) My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
(Can I have the attention of the class for one second?)
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

[Verse 1: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Hi, kids, do you like violence? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wanna see me stick nine-inch nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah, yeah)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryna get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
And Dr. Dre said, ""Slim Shady, you a basehead"" (Uh-uh)
""Then why's your face red? Man, you wasted""
Well, since age 12, I felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Come here, slut; ""Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg""
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

[Verse 2: Eminem]
My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Shh)
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Ow)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship While they're screaming at me, ""Let's just be friends""
99 percent of my life, I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her
(Oh, thank you)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans
(Ahh, ahh, ahh)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it, ""Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole""

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away (Get him)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh, yup)
Am I comin' or goin'? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (Come here)
When I was little, I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang)
'Cause I'm steamin' mad (Grr)
And by the way, when you see my dad (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had

[Chorus: Eminem]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, who? My name is, huh?

309,Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem),"[Produced By: Mark the 45 King]

[Intro]
Take the bass line out
Uh-huh, Jigga
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah
Let it bump though

[Chorus]
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

[Verse 1]
From standin' on the corners, boppin'
To drivin' some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
From droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke Glock
Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all niggas know me to fail? Fuck naw
Where all my niggas with the rubber grips, bust shots
And if you with me, mama, rub on your tits, and what-not
I'm from the school of the hard knocks, you must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it 50/50, uh-huh
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh
And sip the Cris' and get pissy-pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga Biggie, baby!
You know it's hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter, nigga, Volume 2
Y'all niggas get ready!

[Chorus]
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

[Verse 2]
I flow for those 'dro'ed out
All my niggas locked down in the 10 by four, controllin' the house
We live in hard knocks
We don't take over, we borrow blocks
Burn 'em down and you can have it back
Daddy, I'd rather that
I flow for chicks wishin', they ain't have to strip to pay tuition
I see your vision, mama
I put my money on the longshots
All my ballers that's born to clock
Know I'ma be on top whether I perform or not
I went from lukewarm to hot
Sleepin' on futons and cots to King Size
Green machines, to green 5's
I've seen pies, let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills
Then I put it down type Braille
I'm tight grill with the phony
Rappers, y'all might feel we homies
I'm like, ""Still, y'all don't know me.""
Shit, I'm tight grill when my situation ain't improvin'
I'm tryna murder everything movin' ‚Äì feel me?

[Chorus]
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

[Verse 3]
I don't know how to sleep, I gotta eat, stay on my toes
Got a lotta beef, so logically, I prey on my foes
Hustlin' is still inside of me, and as far as progress
You'd be hard-pressed to find another rapper hot as me
I gave you prophecy on my first joint, and y'all lamed out
Didn't really appreciate it 'til the second one came out
So I stretched the game out, etched your name out
Put Jigga on top and dropped albums non-stop for ya, nigga!

[Chorus]
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked

318,Taking Everything,"[Intro: Spoken]
To my heart
To my car
To my crib
To my kids
Everything

[Verse 1]
Never thought you bring me so much pain
Lord knows I tried to keep you happy girl in every way
Out on the road doing my thang
Trying to keep you laced
Trying to keep a smile upon your face girl
Was all my happiness in vain?
Or did I place in you a little too much faith?
Now nothing but memories
Never though that this would be
The price I had to pay

[Chorus]
You took my heart (yes you did)
You took my car (yes)
You took my crib, yes, you did (yes you did)
Got the nerve to take my kids
Got the nerve to take my kids
Took my love (all my love)
And my life (all my life)
Girl, you took my soul (all of my soul)
Taking everything from me
Taking everything from me
You took my heart, girl, you took my car
And you took my crib, tryin' to take my kids
Girl, you took my love, then you took my soul
Taking everything, everything, everything, everything
Everything!

[Verse 2]
And now I'm sitting all alone
Trying to figure out where you and I went wrong
You know it makes me wanna cry
Just thinking about it makes me wanna
Lay down and die
For the life of me I don't know how
That you could take for granted
And disregard our sacred vows
Now nothing but memories
Never though that this would be
The price I had to pay

[Chorus]
You took my heart
Girl, you took my, my car
Tryin' to take my crib, girl
You got the nerve to take my kids
Got the nerve to take my kids
And take my love, love, love, love
And my life, girl, you took my soul, yeah
Taking everything from me
Taking everything from me
You took my heart, my car
My car
(Crib) my crib, my, my kids, my kids
My love, soul
Everything, everything, everything, everything
Everything!!

[Bridge]
Now I ain't never been no fool
I've always tried to keep my cool
I was faithful and true, never bruised you or used you
Even though sometimes you make me want to
But I loved you
You should try to understand, girl, I was your man
My life was in your hands, baby, my love
Was shinning over there but this wasn't part of your plan
No, no, no, no
What about the plans we had?
Now you're gone and I'm just gonna be a weekend dad, baby
Can I call you baby? Or is that just a passing thing, babe
Listen to this sad song I sing, yeah
What about the ring? What about the ring?

[Chorus]
Oh, ho!!
Now you going away in my car
Girl, you can have the crib
But won't you give me back my kids?
How am I supposed to live?
Oh baby, without love, without love, babe
She given me (my life)
All my life, all my life I'd thought we'd live forever
Said we'd be together
And you would never, never, never, never, never never, never, ever, ever, leave, me
Take my
Heart, crib, cars, kids, love, life, souls from me
My cars, heart, crib, kids, my kids and now
You would never, never, never leave me, oh (my heart)
Cars
Crib, my kids
My love, life
Every

319,No Place That Far,"[Verse 1]
I can't imagine any greater fear
Than waking up without you here
And though the sun would still shine on
My whole world would all be gone
But not for long

[Chorus]
If I had to run
If I had to crawl
If I had to swim a hundred rivers
Just to climb a thousand walls
Always know that I would find a way
To get to where you are
There's no place that far

[Verse 2]
It wouldn't matter why we're apart
Lonely months, two stubborn hearts
Nothing short of God above
Could turn me away from your love
I need you that much

[Chorus]
If I had to run
If I had to crawl
If I had to swim a hundred rivers
Just to climb a thousand walls
Always know that I would find a way
To get to where you are
There's no place that far
If I had to run
If I had to crawl
If I had to swim a hundred rivers
Just to climb a thousand walls
Always know that I would find a way
To get to where you are
There's no place that far

320,Meanwhile,"[Verse 1: Starlito]
Only time will tell
Offer these niggas too much time they gone tell
Only grind by myself
Couple lines of the lean and liter (and my heater)
Ain‚Äôt trying to take a L
Took a loss
Then I learned
What I bought bitch I earned
Fake rap niggas steady lying to themselves (nah
Couple nights ago my fifth time making bail
Took my FN
Got my nine in my belt
No GPS help me find myself
Look inside my heart
All the kindness that left
Eyes all dry
And crying don‚Äôt help
Winners won‚Äôt quit
That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt fail
Yea
And I know all about being fucked up
Won't nobody give you nothing
Call it tough love
No joke
It‚Äôll break a nigga spirits when you broke
That the shit that taught me how to hustle

[Hook: Starlito] 2X
Meanwhile
The bills still coming
I ain‚Äôt got enough money
I can feel it in my stomach
Ain‚Äôt chilling till a nigga get a million every month
You ain‚Äôt with it
Man there ain‚Äôt nothing
I can feel it yeah it‚Äôs coming

[Verse 2: Don Trip]
My balls and my word
That‚Äôs all I have
I don‚Äôt trust shit
You can fault my past
The money bring temporary friends and hoes
I‚Äôve been through them all and it taught my ass
Dirty as the tires and the rental I‚Äôm in
All that work and I never clocked in
Can‚Äôt do nothing but shake my head when I think about all of the money I spent
2% tint on that black 550
If a nigga come get me
He gone have to die with me
AR15 short enough to ride with me
I‚Äôm too rich to catch the bus
But too broke to buy a Bentley
Second thought I could‚Äôve bought two
Still getting three or four for a walk through
I lost money, lost friends, lost love and love ones
No wonder I got lost screws

[Hook: Starlito]

[Verse 3: Young Dolph]
Blowing smoke in the air
I got P‚Äôs everywhere
Woreseome ass bitch won‚Äôt stay out of my ear
Woke feeling like the player of the year
I put the syrup down
Po‚Äôd a glass of Belvedere
You ever been fucked up (Nigga hell yeah)
That‚Äôs why I go so hard on these fuck niggas
Meanwhile I‚Äôm looking for a stash house in Bel Air
I‚Äôm fucked up in the mental
I don‚Äôt trust niggas
My childhood was a wild hood
Niggas getting murked in our hood
This life that we living nigga this shit ain‚Äôt all good
Four grams of that super cookie in my backwoods
Jewelry box full of gold but I use to play them up
Pull up in the hood and all the bitches want hugs
If she roll the weed good I‚Äôll buy the bitch a pair of Uggs
Still jump out on the block with my niggas smoking blunts

321,Powerful Thing,"I've never seen two people in my life
More determined to ignore the obvious
We better stop thinking
Let our hearts start doing the talking

You'd have to be stone deaf dumb and blind
Not to see what's going on with us
So let's jump in
And get over our fear of fallin'
'Cause what we got here

Is a powerful thing
It's a powerful thing
More than three words
And a diamond ring
It can open up the heavens
Make the angels sing
Our love, baby, is a powerful thing

We started out strangers on a two-way street
Neither one of us lookin' to fall in love
But we don't need us a map
To know we're headed in that direction

Well, it's out of our hands
And over our heads
It's something that's bigger than both of us
Turnin' back now's completely out of the question
'Cause what we got here

Is a powerful thing
It's a powerful thing
More than three words
And a diamond ring
It can open up the heavens
Make the angels sing
Our love, baby, is a powerful thing

Stronger than the force of a driving wind
Hotter than a forest fire
There never has been and there never will be
Nothing like the power of you and me, yeah

It's a powerful thing
It's a powerful thing
More than three words
And a diamond ring
It can open up the heavens
Make the angels sing
Our love, baby, is a powerful thing

It's a powerful thing
It's a powerful thing
More than three words
And a diamond ring
It can open up the heavens
Make the angels sing
Our love, baby, is a powerful thing...",Trisha Yearwood,1999,"[80, 57, 50, 52, 53, 60, 61, 62, 61, 68, 79, 85]",12
322,Changes,"[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein' poor and, even worse, I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
""Give the crack to the kids, who the hell cares?
One less hungry mouth on the welfare!""
First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers
Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other
""It's time to fight back,"" that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother
But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other
We gotta start makin' changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things change‚Ä¶ and that's the way it is

[Chorus: Talent]
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
‚ÄòCause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And the only time we chill is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready to see a black president
It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change
Try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game
Now tell me, what's a mother to do?
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you
You gotta operate the easy way
""I made a G today,"" but you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin' crack to the kids
""I gotta get paid!"" ‚Äî well hey, but that's the way it is

[Chorus: Talent]
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah

[Interlude: 2Pac]
We gotta make a change
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes
Let's change the way we eat
Let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other
You see the old way wasn't workin'
So it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
And still I see no changes; can't a brother get a little peace?
It's war on the streets and a war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty
They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the facts, givin' it back to you
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up
Crack you up and pimp-smack you up
You gotta learn to hold your own
They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this
That's the sound of my tool
You say it ain't cool, my mama didn't raise no fool
And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
‚ÄòCause I always got to worry 'bout the payback
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Comin' back after all these years
""Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat,"" that's the way it is

[Chorus: Talent]
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah
(You're my brother, you're my sister)
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah

[Outro: 2Pac]
Some things'll never change",2Pac,1999,"[94, 88, 81, 72, 63, 59, 55, 45, 38, 36, 34, 32, 43, 42, 44]",15
323,Hold On To Me,"Who let the cat out of the bag?
Who told the world that I was older?
Who laughed at all I had?
Who said the race was over?

I am a small and gentle man
Who carries the world upon his shoulders
Kindly lend a helping hand...
Come over

And hold onto me
Hold onto me
And hold onto me
Hold on

And my behavior is hard to understand
When I'm like a phone with no connection
But I'm still doin' all I can
To try and get me some redemption
And I'm knee deep in sinking sand
Crying out for your attention
Kindly lend a helping hand
For once defy convention

And hold onto me
Hold onto me
Hold onto me
Hold on

And hold onto me
Hold onto me
Hold onto me
Hold on

[Dialogue]
Our task is to transform ourselves
Into awakened multidimensional beings
Thus fulfilling our dream
The 4th and 5th dimensions to the third
It is the inner meaning between Earth ascending and Heaven descending
This sacred magic has already been achieved by many of us
The nameless others are awakening daily
As the cause steadfastly intensifies
We are the claiming of divine birthright and heritage
Remembering that we are angels incarnate;
Vast starried beings of light
We are no longer limited and bound by the illusions of time, space, and matter
We are ready to join as dominations of the one
The doorways cannot be opened or passed by any of us
Still operating as individual units of consciousness
They are brought into manifestation from our unified presence;
Through our focused intent;
Through our total commitment to serving a higher purpose
This is the bridge to an entirely different energy pattern
It is the step beyond the mound dimensional universe
It is a journey into the unknown which shall lead us ever closer to home",Placebo,1999,"[96, 75, 67, 61, 51, 40, 33, 35, 45, 43, 50, 57, 65, 67, 65]",15
324,Nas Is Like,"[Produced by DJ Premier]

[Intro]
(Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is;
Nas is like; Nas is like; Nas is like)
Umm, Premo, Nas
Yeah, yeah, yo
(Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is;
Nas is like)

[Verse 1]
Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's being born
Same time a man is murdered‚Äîthe beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural I explain
My plateau, and also, what defines my name
First it was Nasty, but times have changed
Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my sign's for pain
I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
Saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine
Saw my close friends shot, flatline, am I sane?
That depends, carry MAC-10s to practice my aim
On rooftops, tape CD covers to trees
Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
Street scriptures for lost souls, in the crossroads
To the corner thugs hustling for cars that cost dough
To the big dogs living large, taking in light
Pushing big toys, getting nice, enjoying your life
It's what you make it, suicide, few try to take it
Belt tied around their neck in jail cells naked
Heaven and Hell, rap legend, presence is felt
And of course N-A-S are the letters that spell (Nas, Nas, Nas)

[Chorus]
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing (Uh)
No doubt
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel (Uh, uh)
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing (Uh)
No doubt (Uh)

[Verse 2]
(Nas is like) Earth, Wind & Fire, rims and tires
Bulletproof glass, inside is the realest driver
Planets in orbit, line 'em up with the stars
Tarot cards, you can see the pharaoh Nas
(Nas is like) Iron Mike, messiah type
Before the Christ, after the death - the last one left
Let my cash invest in stock
Came a long way from blasting TECs on blocks
Went from Seiko to Rolex, owning acres
From the projects with no chips, to large cake dough
Dimes giving fellatio, siete zeros
Bet my 9 spit for the pesos, but what's it all worth?
Can't take it with you under this earth
Rich men died and tried, but none of it worked
They just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid
Before my number's called, history's made
Some'll fall, but I rise, thug or die
Making choices that determine my future under the sky
To rob, steal or kill, I'm wondering why
It's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?
Much success to you, even if you wish me the opposite
Sooner or later we'll all see who the prophet is

[Chorus]
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing (C'mon)
No doubt
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing
No doubt (Uh)

[Verse 3]
(Nas is like) Sex to a nympho, but nothing sweet
I'm like beef, busting heat through your windows
I'm like a street sweeper, green leaf breather
Like Greeks in Egypt, learning something deep from they teachers
I'm like crime, like your 9, your man you would die for
Always got you, I‚Äôm like Pac, dude you would cry for
I'm like a whole lot of loot, I'm like crisp money
Corporate accounts from a rich company
I'm like ecstasy for ladies, I'm like all races
Combined in one man; like the '99 Summer Jam
Bulletproof Hummer man
I'm like being locked down around new faces, and none of 'em fam
I'm the feeling of a millionaire spending a hundred grand
I'm a poor man's dream, a thug poet
Live it and I write down and I watch it blow up
Y'all know what I'm like, y'all play it in your system every night, now

[Chorus]
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing
No doubt
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing
No doubt (Uh); Nas is like",Nas,1999,"[98, 87, 86, 89]",4
325,Ha,"[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die today, I just wanna die
I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die
And let me tell you why

[Verse 1: Logic]
All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout, they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I know I'm hurting deep down, but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine

[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I want you to be alive, I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die today, you don't gotta die
I want you to be alive, I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die, now let me tell you why

[Verse 2: Alessia Cara]
It's the very first breath when your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air when you're there chest-to-chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long, seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection, finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

[Verse 3: Logic]
I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

[Pre-Chorus: Logic]

326,I'm Your Angel,"[Verse 1: C√©line Dion]
No mountains too high, for you to climb
All you have to do is have some climbing faith, oh yeah
No rivers too wide, for you to make it across
All you have to do is believe it when you pray

[Pre-Chorus: R. Kelly]
And then you will see, the morning will come
And every day will be bright as the sun
All of your fears, cast them on me
I just want you to see

[Chorus: C√©line Dion & R. Kelly]
I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel
And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel
I'm your angel

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
I saw the teardrops, and I heard you cry
All you need is time, seek me and you shall find
You have everything and you're still lonely
It don't have to be this way, let me show you a better day

[Pre-Chorus: C√©line Dion]
And then you will see, the morning will come
And all of your days will be bright as the sun
So all of your fears, just cast them on me
How can I make you see?

[Chorus: C√©line Dion & R. Kelly]
I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel
And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel
I'm your angel

[Verse 3: C√©line Dion & R. Kelly]
And when it's time to face the storm
I'll be right by your side
Grace will keep us safe and warm
And I know we will survive
And when it seems as if your end is drawing near
(It is drawing near)
Don't you dare give up the fight (Oh no)
Just put your trust beyond the skies

[Chorus: C√©line Dion & R. Kelly]
I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel
And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your angel
I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I'll hear your voices when you call me
I am your angel
And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near

327,Lullaby,"[Intro]
I spy
Something beginning with 'S'

[Verse 1]
On candy stripe legs the Spiderman comes
Softly through the shadow of the evening sun
Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead
Looking for the victim shivering in bed
Searching out fear in the gathering gloom
And suddenly a movement in the corner of the room
And there is nothing I can do when I realize with fright
That the Spiderman is having me for dinner tonight

[Verse 2]
Quietly he laughs and shaking his head
Creeps closer now, closer to the foot of the bed
And softer than shadow and quicker than flies
His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes
Be still, be calm, be quiet now, my precious boy
Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more
For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light
The Spiderman is having you for dinner tonight

[Bridge]
And I feel like I'm being eaten
By a thousand million shivering furry holes
And I know that in the morning
I will wake up in the shivering cold
And the Spiderman is always hungry

If ya feel real good wave your hands in the air
And lick two shots in the atmosphere!
(Put them up, put them up)
(Put them up, put them up)
(Put them up, put them up)

[Verse 1]
It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?
You act like you ain't hear him then give him a little trim
To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend
Like you wasn't down and you called him again?
Plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again
Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian
A Muslim, sleeping with the jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?
Showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Baby girl, respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending 'em
Now, Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn
It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in
Look at where you be in, hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans
Come again

(A win win, come again
A win win, come again)

[Hook]
Guys you know you'd better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

[Verse 2]
The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women
Him and his men come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend, poppin' yang (like you got yen!)
Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by they waist men
Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement
The pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men
Need to take care of they three or four kids
And they face a court case when the child support late
Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky, silent men
The punk, domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
Come again, come again
Come again, come again

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone & Thug Queen]
The name is Krayzie, big bad-ass Bone
Wanted up north for all the gold that I stole
Along with some cash, even took the mayors daughter
Now that there's kidnap, but she was with it so I brought her
Done got myself into a whole heap of trouble
Double crossed by the law so there's nobody to run to
Yeah its just me and my sawed off shotgun
Outlaw call him Leather Face
I'm headed for the west
Heard they got a couple banks in town that ain't been held up yet
Well uh, I oughtta make it by sundown
I figure that's enough time for me to get the whole run down
So I continue my mission
Its gettin' dark so now now I'm watchin' for them damn injuns
They like to catch us, then they rob and split
I be a rootin', tootin', shootin' damn fool, protecting my chips
All of the sudden I heard somebody rumble in the bushes
Stop my horse ""whoa nellie""
Who in the bushes you betta speak out or I'ma let my shotgun song sing out
Who is this? Hope this ain't the lawJar out the bushes with my sawed-off shotgun
Come on out right now I'm gettin angry
Took a step back cause it could get dangerous
Please don't shoot its just me Thug Queen the horse stealer
Then why the hell is you hidin' in them bushes
I'm wanted in four counties
For armed robberies
Killed two sheriffs, six of his best men want my head
Stole two horses
Thought you was the law that's why I jumped in them bushes
Goodness, now she was hotter than the barrel of fire
But I could use her for the job so I told her to ride come on
May I ask you what you headed to the west for?
I got a partner, got a plan for some dough
And if you down you can pick up yourself a pretty penny
Be in town in a minute, now be sure if you with it
We out before the sunrise
Gotta stallion for ya partner to ride
Hit the saloon for the moonshine
Down for whatever lets ride lets ride
These directions say we go to Tucson, Arizona
When we arrive we'll cop a place we can bunk
And meet my boy in the morning for details and hookups

[Chorus]
You betta count your money (ghetto)
You betta count your money (cowboy)

[Bridge: Krayzie Bone, Thug Queen]
Rise and shine, good morning howdy
Nine o clock we meet my boy in the saloon in the valley
Now I done came along way I don't wanna be late
Tell him we make it to him
You know where we at (Move Out!)

[Chorus 2]
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up (Move out!)

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone, Powder P, Krayzie Bone & Thug Queen]
I'm peepin' Krazyie's warning poster in the saloon
So I assume it'll be trouble round here pretty soon
Glance across the room I see this youngster gettin' ready to fight
But if he mess up the night, I think that Krayzie just might take his life
So I approach him and I pause
""Look man I really don't wanna brawl
But won't you chill before them laws
Come messing up this master plan?""
Since he already rowdy I just asked the man, hey
""You want some work, well partna put in ya bid
Now by the was whats your name? They call me Layzie the Kid""
""The names Powder P, can I get a twelve gauge?
Outlaw everyday on the front page
Mr Kid, if you give me the low down
Me and Blackjack, we ready for the showdown
With two double barrels pointed at whatever
We'll stick together, I'm perdy clever""
So saddle up jump on the bandwagon
Because its all goin' down
I heard a guy run in the bar screaming Krayzie's in town
Now when we get to the saloon, you don't worry
Wait outside and dont' be stealin' nobody's damn horses
Stepped inside the bar, Layzie Kid, you son of a gun!
Hey man I'm glad you made it safely
Now let's go have some fun
And this my partner powder hes a young gun
Howdy
Mighty glad to meet ya son
Oh yeah you know I also brought a friend along
Meet Thug Queen the horse peddler
Straggler, just met her
Howdy partner
Already got the horses saddled up
I hope you good at robbing banks
Like you rustle that cattle
Now y'all

And all our fingers and underneath
Our fingernails that clasp on sheets
As we try desperately to sleep
Hearts are sad and eyes are tired
And all this red bull keeps us wired
It gives us wings
It gives us rings around our eyes

We put three sugars in our tea
Sit to watch day time tv
And laugh at mums who don‚Äôt know who the father is
And all our girlfriends are long gone
We watch too much internet porn
Who needs love when you‚Äôve got silicone and strap ons

And beer bloats our spoilt guts
And shit jobs keep us in ruts
And keep us eyeing up the what‚Äôs and if‚Äôs and buts and maybe‚Äôs and
Falling over in the street
Is just a part of every week
And we lie drunkenly just staring at the stars

Remember when they were in reach
And all the teachers used to teach
You can do anything if you put your mind to it
We put our minds to it all
But disappointment crashed the ball
We could‚Äôve done anything
We just never quite knew it

Many nights we've prayed
With no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts a hopeful song
We barely understood
Now, we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains
Long before we knew we could

[Chorus: Whitney Houston]
There can be miracles when you believe
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles you can achieve?
When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
In this time of fear
When prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seems like the summer birds
Too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here
My heart's so full, I can't explain
Seeking faith and speaking words
I never thought I'd say

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & Whitney Houston]
There can be miracles when you believe
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles you can achieve?
When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you    believe

[Verse 3: Mariah Carey & Whitney Houston]
They don't always happen when you ask
And it's easy to give in to your fears
But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see your way clear through the rain
A small but still resilient voice says, ""Help is very near!""

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & Whitney Houston]
There can be miracles when you believe
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill

Step into the night, love
It grows dark but you don't mind
Hiding in the back streets, yeah, you'll never notice me

Was cleaning up my conscience
Lost in the memory as it shakes up the corners of my heart
Was it my mistake?
Or maybe it was just as simple as a change in your heart

Like Great Day, me and my nigga decide to take the back way
We stabbin' every city then we headed to that Bat cave
ATL, Georgia, what do we do for ya?
Bulldoggin' hoes like them Georgetown Hoyas

Doing doughnuts 'round you suckas like them circles around titties

I met a gypsy and she hipped me to some life game
To stimulate then activate the left and right brain
Said, ""Baby boy, you only funky as your last cut
You focus on the past, your ass'll be a 'has-what'""
That's one to live by or either that's one to die to
I try to just throw it at you, determine your own adventure
Andr√©, got to her station, here's my destination
She got off the bus, the conversation lingered in my head
For hours, took a shower, kinda sour 'cause my favorite group
Ain't comin' with it, but I'm witchya 'cause you probably goin' through it
Anyway, but anyhow, when in doubt
Went on out and bought it 'cause I thought it would be jammin'
But examine all the flawsky-wawsky, awfully
Sad and it's costly, but that's all she
Wrote and I hope I never have to float in that boat
Up shit's creek, ""It's weak"" is the last quote
That I wanna hear when I'm goin' down
When all's said and done and we got a new joe in town
When the record player get to skippin' and slowin' down
All y'all can say is, ""Them niggas earned that crown"", but until then

Montreal? Oh, her family's there.

- Then we're off. - When?

- Tomorrow. - You're not ready, are you?

KEVIN:
Mom, Uncle Frank won't let me watch the movie, but the big kids can. Why can't I?

KATE:
Kevin, I'm on the phone. (Back on the phone) When do you come back? Not 'til then?

KEVIN:
It's not even rated R. He's just being a jerk.

KATE:
Kevin, if Uncle Frank says no, then it must be really bad. No, we put the dog in the kennel for the-- (Kevin gets on the bed and starts reading a magazine) Hey hey hey, get off! Kevin, out of the room.

KEVIN:
Hang up the phone and make me, why don't ya?

KATE:
This kid.  (Peter enters)

PETER:
Kate, did you pick up a voltage adaptor thing?

KATE:
No, I didn't have time to do that.

KEVIN:
Then how do I shave in France?

KATE:
Grow a goatee.

KEVIN:
Dad, nobody'll let me do anything.

PETER:
You don't have anything to do? I have something for you to do. You can pick up those MicroMachines that are all over in there. Aunt Leslie stepped on one of them and almost broke her neck.

KATE:
He was in the garage again playing with the glue gun.

PETER:
Didn't we talk about that?

KEVIN:
Did I burn down the joint? I don't think so. I was making ornaments out of fish hooks.

PETER:
My new fish hooks?

KEVIN:
I can't make them out of old ones, with dry worm guts stuck on them.

KATE:
Peter...?

PETER:
Come on, Kevin. Out. (Peter picks up Kevin; enter Leslie)

LESLIE:
Peter, Kate, do you guys have a voltage adaptor?

PETER:
Here! Here's a voltage adapter! (He gives Kevin to Leslie)

LESLIE:
Oh God, you're getting heavy! (Drops Kevin) Go pack your suitcase.

KEVIN:
Pack my suitcase?

(CUT TO ? AND FULLER DOWNSTAIRS)

?: Do you know where the shampoo is, Fuller?

FULLER: I don't live here.

?: I don't believe. in a house with this many people, there's no shampoo.

HARRY:
Are your folks home?

?:
Yeah, but they don't live here. (Walks up the stairs while Tracy walks down; Exit ?) Tracy, did you order the pizza?

TRACY:
Buzz did.

HARRY:
Excuse me, Miss? Are your parents home?

TRACY:
My parents live in Paris, sorry. (Exit Tracy, enter Sondra)

HARRY:
Hi!

Sondra:
Hi!

HARRY:
Are your parents home?

Sondra:
Yeah.

HARRY:
Do they live here?

SONDRA:
No. (Exit Sondra)

HARRY:
No. Why should they? All kids, no parents. Probably a fancy orphanage.

(CUT TO KEVIN AND JEFF UPSTAIRS)

KEVIN:
I don't know how to pack a suitcase. I've never done this once in my whole life.

JEFF:
Tough.

KEVIN:
That's what Megan said. (Enter Megan)

MEGAN:
What did I say?

JEFF:
You told Kevin ""Tough.""

MEGAN:
The dope was whining about a suitcase. What was I supposed to say? ""Congratulations, you're an idiot""?

KEVIN:
I'm not an idiot!

MEGAN:
Oh, really? You're completely helpless! Everyone has to do everything for you.

JEFF:
She's right, Kev.

KEVIN:
Excuse me, puke-breath. I'm a lot smaller than you. I don't know how to pack a suitcase. (Enter Linnie)

LINNIE:
I hope you didn't just pack crap, Jeff.

JEFF:
Shut up, Linnie.

KEVIN:
Do you know what I should pack?

JEFF:
Buzz told you, cheek-face. Toilet paper and water. (Exit Jeff)

LINNIE:
Listen, Kevin, what are you so worried about? You know Mom's gonna pack your stuff, anyway. You're what the French call ""les incompetents"".

KEVIN:
What?

(CUT TO JEFF AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS)

JEFF:
Bombs away! (Jeff throws bag that lands right at Harry's feet.)

(CUT TO KEVIN AND LINNIE)

LINNIE:
P.S.: You have to sleep on the hide-a-bed with Fuller. If he has something to drink, he's going to wet the bed. (Exit Linnie)

KEVIN:
This house is so full of people. It makes me sick! When I grow up and get married, I'm living alone! Did you hear me? I'm living alone! I'm living alone!

(CUT TO BUZZ'S ROOM)

ROD:
Who's gonna feed your spider while we're gone?

BUZZ:
He just ate a load of mice guts. He should be good for a couple of weeks. Is it true French babes don't shave their pits?

ROD:
Some don't.

BUZZ:
But they got nude beaches.

ROD:
Not in the winter. (Enter Kevin)

KEVIN:
Buzz?

BUZZ:
Don't you know how to knock, phlegm-wad?

KEVIN:
Can I sleep in your room? I don't want to sleep in the hide-a-bed with Fuller. If he has something to drink, he'll wet the bed.

BUZZ:
I wouldn't let you sleep in my room if you were growing on my ass. (Buzz looks out the window) Check it out. Old man Marley. (Rod, Kevin, and Buzz watch Old Man Marley outside Buzz's window)

ROD:
Who's he?

BUZZ:
You ever heard of the South Bend Shovel Slayer?

ROD:
No.

BUZZ:
That's him. Back in '58, he murdered his whole family and half the people on his block... with a snow shovel. Been hiding out in this neighborhood ever since.

ROD:
If he's the shovel slayer, how come the cops don't arrest him?

BUZZ:
Not enough evidence to convict. They never found the bodies. But everyone around here knows he did it. It'll just be a matter of time, before he does it again.

ROD:
What's he doing now?

BUZZ:
He walks up and down the street every night, salting the sidewalks.

ROD:
Maybe he's just trying to be nice.

BUZZ:
No way. You see that garbage can full of salt? That's where he keeps his victims. The salt turns the bodies into mummies.

ROD:
Wow.

KEVIN:
Mummies! (Old Man Marley looks up)

BUZZ:
Look out! (Buzz closes the drapes)

(CUT TO MCCALLISTER HOUSE: HARRY, FULLER, AND ?)

HARRY:
How you kids doing, huh? Good? Lot of action around here today, huh? Going on vacation? Where you going? You hear me, or what? Going on a trip? Where you going, kid?

PIZZA BOY:
Okay, that's $122.50.

HARRY:
Not from me, kid. I don't live here.

PIZZA BOY:
Oh, you just around for the holidays?

HARRY:
I guess you could say that.

FRANK:
Hey, pizza's here!

PIZZA BOY:
There you go. That's $122.50.

FRANK:
It's my brother's house. He'll take care of it. (All kids go into the kitchen)

HARRY:
Hey, listen... (Enter Peter)

PETER:
Hey.

HARRY:
Hi. Are you Mr. McCallister?

PETER:
Yeah.

HARRY:
The Mr. McCallister who lives here?

PETER:
Yes.

PIZZA BOY:
Good, because somebody owes me $122.50.

HARRY:
I'd like a word with you, sir.

PETER:
Am I under arrest or something?

HARRY:
No, no, no, no. It's Christmas time. There's always a lot of burglaries around the holidays. So we're just checking the neighborhood to see if everyone's taking the proper precautions; that's all.

PETER:
Oh, yeah. Well we have automatic timers for our lights, locks for our doors. That's about as well as anybody can do these days, right? Did you get some eggnog or something like that? (Enter Buzz)

BUZZ: Come on, Dad. Let's eat. (Exit Buzz and Peter)

HARRY: Eggnog? (Enter Kevin) Listen, are you going to be leaving...?

KEVIN: Pizza! Pizza! Pizza!

(CUT TO KITCHEN)

LESLIE:
Grab yourself a napkin, and you're going to have to pour your own drinks.

Mom, does Santa Claus have to go through customs?

FULLER:
What time do we have to go to bed?

FRANK:
Early. We're leaving the house at 8 a.m. On the button.

KATE:
I hope you're all drinking milk. I want to get rid of it.

PETER:
Honey, the pizza boy needs $122.50, plus tip.

KATE:
For pizza?

PETER:
10 pizzas times 12 bucks.

LESLIE:
Frank, you've got money! Come on...

FRANK:
Traveler's checks.

KATE:
Forget it, Frank. We have cash.

PETER:
You probably got the checks that don't work in France.

KEVIN:
Did anyone order me a plain cheese?

BUZZ:
Oh, yeah, we did. But if you want any, somebody's gonna have to barf it up, because it's gone.

LESLIE:
Fuller! Go easy on the Pepsi.

BUZZ:
Kev! Kev, get a plate. (Buzz chokes on the cheese; Kevin pushes him into the table and Buzz barfs)

PETER:
Passports! (Peter spills Pepsi)

FRANK:
Watch it! (Frank's chair is pulled out and hits Fuller; people start to clean up kitchen table quickly)

PETER:
No, no. Get these passports out of here. (Peter throws away a bunch of napkins, along with Kevin's airline ticket; Leslie picks Fuller up)

LESLIE:
Are you okay, honey? Come here. Are you all right? (Kate grabs Kevin's hand)

KATE:
What is the matter with you?

KEVIN:
He started it! He ate my pizza on purpose. He knows I hate sausage and olives...

FRANK:
Look what you did, you little jerk!

KATE:
Kevin, get upstairs right now.

KEVIN:
Why?

JEFF:
Kevin, you're such a disease.

KEVIN:
Shut up!

PETER:
Kevin, upstairs!

KATE:
Say good night, Kevin.

KEVIN:
""Good night, Kevin."" (Exit Kevin & Kate, and Kate takes Kevin out of the room by his arm)

(CUT TO DOWNSTAIRS WHERE KEVIN AND KATE MEET PIZZA BOY)

KEVIN:
Why do I always get treated like scum?

KATE:
Oh, I'm sorry. This house is just crazy. We've got all these extra kids running around and my brother-in-law drove in from Ohio today. It's just nuts. (Kate hands Pizza Boy money)

KEVIN:
How come you didn't bring more cheese pizzas?

PIZZA BOY:
Nice tip. Thanks a lot. (Exit Pizza Boy, enter Harry)

KATE:
Thanks.

HARRY:
Having a reunion or something?

KATE:
Oh no. My husband's brother transferred to Paris last summer and both of his kids are still going to school here, and I guess he missed the whole family. (Harry smiles at Kevin, showing his gold tooth) He's giving us all this trip to Paris for the holidays, so we can be together.

HARRY:
You're taking a trip to Paris?

KATE:
Yes. We hope to leave tomorrow morning.

HARRY:
Excellent. Excellent.

KATE:
If you'll excuse me, this one's a little out of sorts. I'll be right back. (Kate and Kevin go upstairs)

HARRY:
Don't worry about me. I spoke to your husband already. And don't worry about your home. It's in good hands. (Exit Harry)

(CUT TO UPSTAIRS)

KATE:
There are 15 people in this house and you're the only one who has to make trouble.

KEVIN:
I'm the only one getting dumped on.

KATE:
You're the only one acting up. Now get upstairs!

KEVIN:
I am upstairs, dummy! (Kate opens the door to the third floor) The third floor?

KATE:
Go.

KEVIN:
It's scary up there.

KATE:
Don't be silly. Fuller will be up in a little while.

KEVIN:
I don't want to sleep with Fuller. You know about him: he wets the bed. He'll pee all over me. I know it.

KATE:
Fine, we'll put him somewhere else.

KEVIN:
I'm sorry.

KATE:
It's too late. Get upstairs. (Kevin walks up stairs and stops)

KEVIN:
Everyone in this family hates me.

KATE:
Then maybe you should ask Santa for a new family.

KEVIN:
I don't want a new family. I don't want any family. Families suck!

KATE:
Just stay up there! I don't want to see you again for the rest of the night.

KEVIN:
I don't want to see you again for the rest of my whole life. And I don't want to see anybody else either.

KATE:
I hope you don't mean that. You'd feel pretty sad if you woke up tomorrow morning and you didn't have a family.

KEVIN:
No, I wouldn't.

KATE:
Then say it again. Maybe it'll happen.

KEVIN:
I hope I never see any of you jerks again. (Kevin walks upstairs, Kate closes the door)

(CUT TO THE THIRD FLOOR)

MITCH:
Hi, I'm Mitch Murphy. I live across the street. You guys going out of town? We're going to Orlando, Florida. Well, first we're going to Missouri to pick up my grandma. You know the McCallisters are going to France? Do you know if it's cold there? Do these vans get good mileage?

VAN DRIVER:
Gee, kid, I don't know. Hit the road!

(CUT TO McCALLISTER HOUSE)

KATE:
Heather, do a head count. Make sure everyone's in the vans. Where are the passports and tickets?

PETER:
I put them in the microwave to dry off.

(CUT TO THE VAN)

MITCH:
How fast does this thing go? Does it have automatic transmission? Does it have 4-wheel drive?

VAN DRIVER:
Look, I told you before, kid: don't bother me. Now, beat it! (Mitch stays in the back of the van; McCallister kids go outside)

HEATHER:
Line up in front of the van. Come on guys, line up and shut up! (Mitch opens a McCallister bag)

MITCH:
Wow!

Shut up! I need a head count. 1-2-3-4-5...

MITCH:
Have a good trip. Bring me back something French. (Exit Mitch; enter Kate, Leslie, Peter and Frank)

There's no way we'll make this plane. It leaves in 45 minutes.

PETER:
Think positive, Frank!

FRANK:
You be positive. I'll be realistic. (Adults get in the van)

ELECTRICAL WORKER:
Ma'am. Excuse me. I just wanted to let you know that your power is fixed, but the phone lines are a mess. It's going to take around a couple of days to patch them up, especially around the holidays.

KATE:
Okay, thanks. (Kate closes the van) Heather, did you count heads?

HEATHER:
11, including me. 5 boys, 6 girls, 4 parents, 2 drivers... and a partridge in a pear tree.

(CUT: VANS DRIVE OFF, McCALLISTERS RUSH TO THE TERMINAL)

KATE:
Don't you feel like a heel, flying first class with all of the kids back in coach?

PETER:
No. The kids are fine. The only flying I ever did as a kid was in the family station wagon, and it wasn't to France. We used to have to go to Aunt Laura and Uncle Arthur's house. The kids are okay. They're having the time of their lives.

What money?

SNAKES:
Acey said you had some dough for me.

JOHNNY:
Is that a fact? How much do I owe you?

Acey Said ten percent.

Too bad Acey ain't in charge no more.

Guys, I'm eating junk and watching rubbish! You better come out and stop me!

He'll call you when he gets out. (Pause) Hey. I'll tell you what I'm gonna give you, Snakes. I'm gonna give you to the count of 10 to get your ugly, yellow, no-good keister off my property... before I pump your guts full of lead.

Did I turn off the coffee?

PETER:
No. I did.

KATE:
Did you lock up?

PETER:
Yeah.

Did you close the garage?

Look, honey. The kids are exhausted. You are exhausted. There's absolutely nothing more that we can do at this airport. Now I say we go over to Rob's, and that way we can call the police again. And they can get back to us.

KATE:
Peter, Kevin is there all by himself. I'm not leaving here unless it's on an airplane.

AGENT:
Madame, we are doing everything we can. Now, if you want to stay at the airport, maybe we can get you on standby. It is a possibility that a seat will open up.

PETER:
Is that okay?

KATE:
Yes. I'll wait.

(CUT TO PETER AND KATE SAYING GOODBYE TO EACH OTHER)

KATE:
Bye. I'll miss you, honey. (Peter and Kate hug)

PETER: Don't you get lost. (Kate waves goodbye to the rest of the McCallister family)

(CUT TO THE McCALLISTER HOUSE; KEVIN IS GROOMING HIMSELF)

KEVIN:
I took a shower, washing every body part with natural soap, including all my major crevices between my toes and in my belly button, which I never did before but sort of enjoyed. I washed my hair with adult formula shampoo and used creme rinse. I can't find my toothbrush, so I'll pick one up today. Other than that, I'm in good shape. (Kevin puts on aftershave and screams out of agony)

(CUT TO BUZZ'S ROOM; KEVIN LOOKS AT THE TOP OF BUZZ'S SHELF AND FINDS BUZZ'S LIFE SAVINGS; AS HE CLIMBS, ONE OF THE SHELVES BREAKS AND EVERYTHING FALLS DOWN)

HARRY:
You know you're one of the great cat burglars of the world, Marv? You think you can keep it down a little in there? (Phone rings)

JACK MURPHY:
(On the voicemail) Hi, you've reached the Murphy's. Please leave a message after you hear the beep.

PETER:
Jack, this is Peter McCallister again. We're in Paris at my brother's apartment. Let me give you the number here, okay. The country code is 3-3. The area code is 1-4 and the number is 694-876...

MARV:
Hey, Harry.

HARRY:
Yeah?

MARV:
That house we were at last night, was that the McCallister's?

HARRY:
Yeah.

MARV:
You're right. They're gone.

HARRY:
I knew they were.

MARV:
Silver tuna tonight. (Harry looks an expensive toy, seeing all kinds of shapes and colors when you flip turn the knobs)

HARRY:
Wow!

(CUT TO A STORE; KEVIN STEPS UP TO THE COUNTER AND MEETS A CASHIER)

CASHIER:
How may I help you?

KEVIN:
Is this toothbrush approved by the American Dental Association? (Kevin hands her the toothbrush)

CASHIER:
Well, I don't know. (Cashier looks at the back of it) It doesn't say, hon.

KEVIN:
Can you please find out?

CASHIER:
Herb.

HERB:
Yeah?

CASHIER:
I've got a question here about a toothbrush. (Enter Old Man Marley) Do you know, is this brush approved by the American Dental Association?

HERB:
I don't know. (Old Man Marley slams his hand on the counter; Kevin locks eyes with Old Man Marley, he walks backwards with the toothbrush heading out the door)

CASHIER:
Oh, hon, you pay for that here. Wait, son, you have to pay for that toothbrush. Son! Son! (Kevin rushes out of the store) Hey! Jimmy, stop that boy! (Jimmy runs out)

(CUT TO OUTSIDE WHERE KEVIN CONTINUES TO RUN)

JIMMY:
Hey! Hey! (Jimmy spots a police officer, who is writing up someone a ticket nearby) Shoplifter!

(CUT TO KEVIN WALKING BACK HOME, LOOKING AT THE TOOTHBRUSH)

KEVIN
I'm a criminal.

(CUT TO MARV PUTTING RAGS IN THE SINK'S DRAINS AND TURNING ON THE FAUCET FULL BLAST; HE WALKS OUT OF THE HOUSE WITH A BULGING BAG AND VCR, LOADS THEM INTO THE VAN LAUGHING)

HARRY:
What's so funny? What's so funny? What are you laughing at? You did it again, didn't you? You left the water running, didn't you? What's wrong with you? Why do you do that? I told you not to do it.

MARV:
Harry, It's our calling card!

HARRY:
Calling card.

MARV:
All the great ones leave their mark. We're the wet bandits.

HARRY:
You're sick, you know? You're really sick.

MARV:
I'm sick...?

HARRY:
Yes, you are.

MARV:
I'm not sick.

HARRY:
It's a sick thing to do!

(CUT TO HARRY AND MARV DRIVING; KEVIN IS WALKING WITH HIS HEAD DOWN)

HARRY:
We don't need that ca--

MARV:
Don't tell me what to do. I can do it if I want to. It's not sick. Hey, watch out! (Kevin freezes in the middle of the road; Harry slams on the brakes; Kevin screams; Harry rolls down his window as Kevin continues to walk fast)

HARRY:
Hey! Hey! You've gotta watch for traffic, you know...?

KEVIN:
Sorry.

HARRY:
Damn.

MARV:
Santy don't visit the funeral homes, buddy. (Kevin nods)

HARRY:
Okay, okay. Merry Christmas. (Harry smiles, showing his gold tooth; Kevin gasps and walks off slowly)

MARV:
What's the matter?

HARRY:
I don't like the way that kid looked at me. Did you see that?

MARV:
You ever seen him before?

HARRY:
I saw a hundred kids this week.

MARV:
Let's see what house he goes into. (Harry follows Kevin slowly; Kevin looks back to find Harry and Marv whistling and looking away from him; Kevin starts running; Harry and Marv continue to follow him)

MARV:
Why's he going faster?

HARRY:
I told you something's wrong. See, I knew he looked at me weird. Why would he run? (Kevin disguises himself right outside the church)

MARV:
Maybe he went in the church.

HARRY:
I'm not going in there.

MARV:
Me neither.

HARRY:
Let's get out of here. (Kevin gets out of his disguise and starts to run home)

KEVIN:
When those guys come back, I'll be ready.

(CUT TO THE McCALLISTER HOUSE; HARRY AND MARV PULL IN TO THE FRONT OF HIS HOUSE; MARV ROLLS DOWN THE WINDOW)

MARV:
Did they come back?

HARRY:
From Paris?

(CUT TO THE INSIDE OF THE McCALLISTER HOUSE, WHERE KEVIN DANCING WHILE MOVING A BUNCH OF MANNEQUINS AND CARDBOARD CUTOUTS)

We'll come back tomorrow. Maybe they'll be gone by then. We better get out of here before somebody sees us. (Exit Harry and Marv; Kevin looks out the window smiling)

(CUT TO ROB's LIVING ROOM; THE McCALLISTER FAMILY IS WATCHING A SHOW IN FRENCH; ENTER FRANK)

FRANK:
Attencion! Attencion! Look what I found in the kitchen.

FRANK:
Mes petits enfants, do you want a little shrimp, huh?

(CUT TO PETER ON THE PHONE IN ANOTHER ROOM)

PETER:
Do you speak English? Parlez Anglais? Well, is there... Did you get anybody? (Speaking in French) I am looking for my son! Do you know where he is?! (Peter talking to Frank) No, I can't find anybody. They're all shopping. Nobody's home for the holidays. (Back on the phone) Never mind, forget it.

(CUT TO ROB'S LIVING ROOM)

MEGAN:
This is so pointless.

BUZZ:
What?

MEGAN:
We're here rotting in this apartment. Kevin's at home. Mom's at the airport.

BUZZ:
So?

MEGAN:
You're not at all worried about Kevin?

BUZZ:
Why should I be? He's acted like a jerk one too many times and this time he caught it in the butt.

MEGAN:
He's so little and helpless. Don't you think he's flipped out?

BUZZ:
The little trout can use a couple of days in the real world.

MEGAN:
You're not at all worried something might happen to him?

BUZZ:
No. For three reasons: A. I'm not that lucky, 2: We have smoke detectors, and D: we live in the most boring street in the United States of American, where nothing even remotely dangerous will ever happen. Period.

PIZZA BOY:
Okay. But what about the money?

JOHNNY:
What money?

PIZZA BOY:
Well, you have to pay for your pizza, sir.

JOHNNY:
Is that a fact? How much do I owe you?

PIZZA BOY:
That'll be $11.80, sir. (Kevin sneaks $12 from the bottom of the door)

JOHNNY:
Keep the change, you filthy animal.

PIZZA BOY:
Cheapskate.

JOHNNY:
Hey. I'm gonna give you to the count of 10 to get your ugly, yellow no-good keister off my property before I pump your guts full of lead. 1, 2, 10. (Gunshot soundbytes and Johnny laughing scare the Pizza Boy; Pizza Boy crashes into garbage cans and runs away frantically and drives off; Kevin opens the door, picks up the pizza and smells it)

KEVIN:
A lovely cheese pizza, just for me. (Kevin closes the door)

(CUT TO PARIS AIRPORT; IRENE AND KATE ARE TALKING)

Do you think it is?

IRENE:
No.

Oh, that is beautiful!

Come on, Irene. They're boarding.

KATE:
The earrings. You love the earrings

ED:
She's got her own earrings. A whole shoebox full of them. Dangly ones. Come on.

IRENE:
No, but... (They are about to leave)

KATE:

Oh, Ed.

(CUT TO KEVIN MOUTHING THE WORDS TO ""I'M DREAMING OF A WHITE CHRISTMAS"" WHILE GROOMING HIMSELF AGAIN)

I'll give them a whirl. (Kelly holds up Attack Force action figures) For the kids. (Kelly scans an orange juice) Hold on, I got a coupon for that. (Kevin hands Kelly the coupon) It was in the paper this morning.

KELLY:
$19.83.

KEVIN:
Okay. (Kevin reaches in his pocket and gives her money)

KELLY:
Are you here all by yourself?

KEVIN:
Ma'am, I'm 8 years old. You think I'd be here alone? I don't think so.

KELLY:
Where's your mom?

KEVIN:
My mom's in the car.

KELLY:
Where's your father?

KEVIN:
He's at work.

KELLY:
What about your brothers and your sisters?

KEVIN:
I'm an only child.

KELLY:
Where do you live?

KEVIN:
I can't tell you that.

KELLY:
Why not?

KEVIN:
Because you're a stranger.

(CUT TO KEVIN WALKING HOME WITH GROCERIES; THE BAGS RIP AND EVERYTHING FALLS OUT)

KEVIN:
Shut up! (The furnace turns off)

(CUT TO HARRY AND MARV'S VAN OUTSIDE THE HOUSE)

HARRY:
I don't get it. Right now, it looks like there's nobody home. Last night the place was jumping. Something ain't right. Go check it out. (Long pause while Harry waits for Marv to check it out)

MARV:
Now?

HARRY:
No, tomorrow, egghead! Now! Go ahead. (Exit Marv) ""Now.""

(CUT TO MARV GOING TO THE BACK DOOR OF THE McCALLISTER HOUSE; HE KICKS THE OPENING OF THE DOOR AND LOSES HIS SHOE; KEVIN RECOGNIZES THIS WHILE DOING DISHES)

JOHNNY:
Get the hell out of here.

SNAKES:
All right, Johnny. But what about my money? (Marv listens closely) Acey Said you had some dough for me.

JOHNNY:
Is that a fact? How much do I owe you?

SNAKES:
Acey Said ten percent.

JOHNNY:
Too bad Acey ain't in charge no more.

SNAKES:
What do you mean? (Kevin takes a pot from the kitchen and puts it near the door opening)

JOHNNY:
He's upstairs, taking a bath. He'll call you when he gets out. Hey, I tell you what I'm gonna give you, Snakes. (Kevin takes firecrackers and a torch)

MARV:
Snakes?

JOHNNY:
I'm going to give you to the count of ten to get your ugly, yellow, no-good keister off my property, before I pump your guts full of lead.

SNAKES:
All right, Johnny. I'm sorry. I'm going.

JOHNNY:
1, 2, 10. (Gunshot soundbytes and firecrackers scare MARV; Pizza Boy jumps over the garbage cans, ducks, then frantically runs to the van; Kevin mouths off the next words) Keep the change, you filthy animal.

(CUT TO HARRY AND MARV's VAN; ENTER MARV)

HARRY:
What happened?

MARV:
I don't know who, but somebody just got blown away.

HARRY:
Huh?

MARV:
Somebody beat us to the job, they're in there. 2 of them. There was arguing. One blew the other one away.

HARRY:
Who?

MARV:
I don't know. I thought I recognized one of their voices. And I know I heard that name ""Snakes"" before.

HARRY:
Snakes? Snakes. Snakes. I don't know no Snakes.

MARV:
Snakes! Let's get out of here. (Harry is about to start the car)

HARRY:
Hold it. Hold it. Let's wait and see who it is. We work this neighborhood, too. Supposing the cops finger us for a job, and they start asking us questions about a murder in the area. Wouldn't it be nice to have a face to go with their questions?

MARV:
That's a good idea.

HARRY:
Of course it's a good idea. Snakes!

MARV:
He sounded like a snake.

Nothing available. May I help you get a hotel room in the city? Tomorrow afternoon, we can get you a flight to Chicago.

KATE:
I can't wait that long.

AGENT:
I'm terribly sorry, ma'am, but we're doing absolutely everything we can. (Signals the next person in line to come to the counter)

KATE:
Go ahead. Wait, I'm sorry. Excuse me. You've got places to go, people to see. You've got a ticket there. That's good. Excuse me. Look, I have been awake for almost 60 hours.I'm tired and I'm dirty. I have been from Chicago to Paris, to Dallas, to... Where the hell am I?

AGENT:
Scranton.

KATE:
I am trying to get home to my 8-year-old son. And now that I'm this close, you're telling me it's hopeless?

AGENT:
I'm sorry.

KATE:
No. No, no, no, no way. This is Christmas! The season of perpetual hope.

AGENT:
Ma'am if...

KATE:
And I don't care if I have to get on your runway and hitchhike. If it costs me everything I own, if I have to sell my soul to the Devil himself, I am going to get home to my son.

AGENT:
Ma'am, if there was anything at all I could do...

KATE:
Do it. Do anything.

AGENT:
I can get you a hotel room... (Enter Gus)

KATE:
What?!

GUS:
Excuse me. Can you excuse us for a second please? Can I see you for a second, please? Excuse us. I couldn't help but hear you got a little bit of a dilemma there. We got a crisis ourselves. (Gus laughs) Allow me to introduce myself. Gus Polinski. How are you? Polka King of the Midwest? The Kenosha Kickers? (The Kenosha Kickers wave hello) That's okay. I thought you might have recognized-- anyways. I had a few hits a few years ago. That's why I thought-- ""Polka, Polka, Polka""? (Gus sings) Polka, polka, polka. (Gus stops singing) No? ""Twin Legs Polka"" ""Yamahoozie Polka,"" a.k.a. ""Kiss Me Polka""? ""Polka Twist""?

KATE:
These are songs?

GUS:
Yeah. Yeah, we... Some fairly big hits for us. You know, in the early '70s. Yeah, we sold about 623 copies of that.

KATE:
In Chicago?

GUS:
No, Sheboygan. Very big in Sheboygan. They love us--

KATE:
I'm sorry, did you say you could help me?

GUS:
Anyway, I'm rambling on here. Our flight was canceled, so we got to drive. See the guy in the yellow jacket over there? He's going to rent us a nice big van and we're going to drive to Milwaukee. Now, I heard you had some problems getting to Chicago? To see your kid or something?

KATE:
My son. He-- We left, and he's there.

GUS:
Oh, jeez. If you have to get to Chicago, we'll gladly drive you. It's on the way to Milwaukee.

KATE:
You'd give me a ride?

GUS:
Sure we would, why not? You know, you've got to get home to see your kid.

KATE:
A ride to Chicago?

GUS:
Sure, you know, it's Christmastime.

KATE:
Thank you. Oh, thank you.

GUS:
If you don't mind going with polka bums?

KATE:
No, I'd love to.

Hey, Marv. Marv, Marv!

MARV:
Wha...?

HARRY:
Look at this. (Kevin saws off the top part of the tree) I think we're getting scammed by a kindergartner.

(CUT TO McCALLISTER HOUSE; KEVIN IS PUTTING UP ORNAMENTS ON THE TREE; HARRY IS SPYING ON HIM; KEVIN SPOTS HIM)

KEVIN:
Dad, can you come here and help me? (Exit Harry)

(CUT TO OUTSIDE McCALLISTER HOUSE)

Remember that kid we saw the other day? He lives here.

MARV:
If the kid's here, the parents got to be. (Harry shakes his head)

HARRY:
He's home alone. (Exit Mar and Harry; Kevin runs away fromt he scene inside the house)

(CUT TO MARV AND HARRY WALKING TO THE VAN)

MARV:
What? You want to come back tonight?

HARRY:
Uh-huh.

MARV:
Even with the kid here?

HARRY:
Uh-huh.

MARV:
I don't think that's a good idea.

HARRY:
Look, that house is the only reason why we started working this block in the first place. Ever since I laid eyes on that house, I wanted it. So let's take it one step at a time. (Kevin overhears them as he open up a window) We'll unload the van, get a bite to eat, we'll come back about 9 o'clock.

KEVIN:
9 o'clock.

HARRY:
This way it's dark then.

MARV:
Yeah, kids are scared of the dark.

HARRY:
You're afraid of the dark too, Marv. You know you are.

MARV:
No, I'm not.

Yes, you are.

Not, not, not.

You are so. (Exit Harry and Marv)

Well, he's getting in his car. If you hurry, you can catch him.

(CUT TO SANTA's CAR; KEVIN IS RUNNING TOWARDS HIM)

Damn! How low can you get giving Chris Kringle a parking ticket on Christmas Eve! What's next, rabies shots for the Easter Bunny?

KEVIN:
Santa, hold on. (Chris puts out his cigarette) Can I talk to you for a minute?

CHRIS:
Make it quick. Santa's got a little get-together he's late for.

KEVIN:
Okay, I know you're not the real Santa Claus.

CHRIS:
What makes you say that? Just out of curiosity. (Chris fixes his beard)

KEVIN:
I'm old enough to know how it works.

CHRIS:
All right.

KEVIN:
But I also know you work for him. I'd like you to give him a message.

CHRIS:
Shoot.

KEVIN:
I'm Kevin McCallister, 671 Lincoln Blvd. Do you need the phone number?

CHRIS:
No, that's all right.

KEVIN:
Okay, this is extremely important. Would you please tell him that instead of presents this year, I just want my family back. No toys. Nothing but Peter, Kate, Buzz, Megan, Linnie and Jeff. And my aunt and my cousins. And if he has time, my Uncle Frank. Okay?

CHRIS:
Okay. I'll see what I can do.

KEVIN:
Thanks. (Turns around)

CHRIS:
Wait. My elf took the last of the candy canes home to her boyfriend.

KEVIN:
That's okay.

CHRIS:
No, don't be silly. Everybody who sees Santa has got to get something. Here, hold out your little paw there. (Chris gives Kevin 3 tic-tacs) There you go. Don't spoil your dinner.

KEVIN:
I won't. Thanks. (Exit Kevin; Chris starts his car and starts to drive off, but he gets stuck)

(CUT TO KEVIN WALKING, SEEING A FAMILY GATHERED IN A HOUSE)

(CUT TO KEVIN GOING INTO THE CHURCH, AFTER LISTENING TO A CHOIR SINGING ""O HOLY NIGHT""; KEVIN GOES INTO THE CHURCH AND SITS DOWN; KEVIN FINDS OLD MAN MARLEY SITTING IN THE SAME CHURCH; OLD MAN MARLEY COMES CLOSER TO HIM; KEVIN HAS A FRIGHTENED LOOK ON HIS FACE)

OLD MAN MARLEY:
Merry Christmas. (Kevin has a confused look on his face) May I sit down? (Kevin nods; Old Man Marley sits down) There's my granddaughter up there. The little red-haired girl. She's about your age. You know her?

KEVIN:
No.

OLD MAN MARLEY:
You live next to me, don't you? (Kevin nods) You can say hello when you see me. You don't have to be afraid. There's a lot of things going around about me, but none of it's true. Okay? (Kevin nods) You've been a good boy this year?

KEVIN:
I think so.

OLD MAN MARLEY:
You swear to it?

KEVIN:
No.

OLD MAN MARLEY:
I had a feeling. Well, this is the place to be if you're feeling bad about yourself.

KEVIN:
It is?

OLD MAN MARLEY:
I think so.

KEVIN:
Are you feeling bad about yourself?

OLD MAN MARLEY:
No.

KEVIN:
I've been kind of a pain lately. I said some things I shouldn't have. I really haven't been too good this year.

OLD MAN MARLEY:
Yeah.

KEVIN:
I'm kind of upset because I really like my family, even though sometimes I say I don't. Sometimes I even think I don't. Do you get that?

OLD MAN MARLEY:
I think so. How you feel about your family is a complicated thing.

KEVIN:
Especially with an older brother.

OLD MAN MARLEY:
Deep down, you'll always love him. But you can forget that you love him. You can hurt them, and they can hurt you. That's not just because you're young. You want to know the real reason why I'm here right now?

KEVIN:
Sure.

OLD MAN MARLEY:
I came to hear my granddaughter sing. And I can't come hear her tonight.

KEVIN:
You have plans?

OLD MAN MARLEY:
No. I'm not welcome.

KEVIN:
At church?

OLD MAN MARLEY:
You're always welcome at church. I'm not welcome with my son. Years back, before you and your family moved on the block, I had an argument with my son.

KEVIN:
How old is he?

OLD MAN MARLEY:
He's grown up. We lost our tempers, and I said I didn't care to see him anymore. He said the same, and we haven't spoken to each other since.

KEVIN:
If you miss him, why don't you call him?

OLD MAN MARLEY:
I'm afraid if I call that he won't talk to me.

KEVIN:
How do you know?

OLD MAN MARLEY:
I don't know. I'm just afraid he won't.

KEVIN:
No offense, but aren't you a little old to be afraid?

OLD MAN MARLEY:
You can be a little old for a lot of things. You're never too old to be afraid.

KEVIN:
That's true. I've always been afraid of our basement. It's dark, there's weird stuff down there, and it smells funn; that sort of thing. It's bothered me for years.

OLD MAN MARLEY:
Basements are like that.

KEVIN:
I made myself go down to do some laundry, and I found out it's not so bad. All this time I've been worried about it, but if you turn on the lights, it's no big deal.

OLD MAN MARLEY:
What's your point?

KEVIN:
My point is, you should call your son.

OLD MAN MARLEY
What if he won't talk to me?

KEVIN:
At least you'll know. Then you could stop worrying about it. Then you won't have to be afraid anymore. I don't care how mad I was, I'd talk to my dad ad. Especially around the holidays.

OLD MAN MARLEY:
I don't know.

KEVIN:
Just give it a shot, for your granddaughter anyway. I'm sure she misses you, and the presents.

OLD MAN MARLEY:
I send her a check.

KEVIN:
I wish my grandparents did that. They always send me clothes. Last year I got a sweater with a big bird knitted on it.

OLD MAN MARLEY:
Oh, that's nice.

KEVIN:
Not for a guy in the second grade. You can get beat up for something like that.

OLD MAN MARLEY:
Oh?

KEVIN:
Yeah. I have a friend who got nailed because there was a rumor he wore dinosaur pajamas.

OLD MAN MARLEY:
You better run along home where you belong. Think about what I said. All right?

KEVIN:
Okay.

OLD MAN MARLEY:
It's nice talking to you.

KEVIN:
Nice talking to you. (Old Man Marley and Kevin shake hands) What about you?

OLD MAN MARLEY:
Me?

KEVIN:
Yeah. You and your son.

OLD MAN MARLEY:

Ooh...

HARRY:
What is it?

You're missing some teeth.

HARRY:
Where? It's my gold tooth. My gold tooth. I'll kill him. I'll kill him! (Harry and Marv get up and go up the stairs) You bomb me with one more can, kid, and I'll snap off your cajones and boil them in motor oil!

Down here, you big horse's ass! Come and get me before I call the police!

Let's get him!

HARRY:
Wait, wait. Just what he wants us to do: is go back downstairs through his fun house so we get all tore up.

He's gonna call the cops!

He's not calling the c-- from a tree house?! Come on. (Harry wraps a white handkerchief around his hand as he comes out of the window)

And we're going to smash his face with an iron. (Enter Old Man Marley with a shovel)

HARRY:
I'd like to slap him in the face with a paint can, maybe.

I'm a bad parent. I'm a bad parent.

GUS:
You're not. You know, You're beating yourself up there, you know. This happens. These things happen, you know. Gee, you want to talk about bad parents? Look at us. We're on the road 48, 49 weeks a year. We hardly see our families. You know, Joe, over there. Gosh, you know, he forgets his kids' names half the time. Ziggy over there, he's never even met his kid. Eddy: let's just hope none of them write a book about him.

KATE:
Tell me, have you gone on vacation and left your child home?

GUS:
No. But I did leave one at a funeral parlor once. Yeah, it was terrible, too. I was all distraught and everything. The wife and I, we left the little tyke there in the funeral parlor all day. All day. You know, we went back at night, when we came to our senses, there he was. Apparently, he was there all day with a corpse. Now, he was okay. You know, after 6, 7 weeks. He came around and started talking again. But he's okay. They get over it. Kids are resilient like that.

KATE:
Maybe we shouldn't talk about this.

GUS:
You brought it up. I was just trying to cheer you up.

KATE:
I'm sorry I did.

Thanks, Buzz. (Buzz and Kevin shake hands)

347,Malibu,"[Verse 1]
I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here, and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free, as birds catchin' the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

[Chorus]
But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you

[Verse 2]
We watched the sun go down as we were walkin'
I'd spent the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current, as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us, just for a while
Do they even exist?
That's when I make a wish, to swim away with the fish
Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

[Chorus]
But here I am, next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you
Next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you

[Outro]
We are just like the waves that flow back and forth

I met you before the fall of Rome
And I begged you to let me take you home
You were wrong, I was right
You said goodbye, I said goodnight

[Chorus]
It's all been done
It's all been done
It's all been done before

[Verse 2]
I knew you before the west was won
And I heard you say the past
Was much more fun
You go your way, I go mine
But I'll see you next time

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And if I put my fingers here, and if I say
""I love you, dear""
And if I play the same three chords
Will you just yawn and say

It's 7:30 and I'm late, they're calling at the airport gate
We are running out of time, I have to go and stand in line
I know you love me, but now it's time to let me go
And I know you're sad but please don't cry
After all it's not goodbye
We're just letting go for a little while

[Verse 2]
And with your final words you lied, when you tell me you'll be fine
You even faked a smile before I disappear behind the door
My heart is beating against the walls inside my chest
But I can go back anytime, after all it's not goodbye
We're just letting go for a little while
Ooh, for a little while

[Bridge]
I guess all that's left to say is I will miss you each and every day

[Verse 3]
Now as I stand here on my own, I'm filled with memories of home
And all the friends that I have known
I realise how much we've grown
It feels like only yesterday, that would walk down Butcher Lane
But I can go back anytime, after all it's not goodbye

Ooh, for a little while

350,Unsent,"[Verse 1]
Dear Matthew, I like you a lot
I realize you're in a relationship with someone right now
And I respect that
I would like you to know that if you're ever single in the future
And you want to come visit me in California
I would be open to spending time with you
And finding out how old you were
When you wrote your first song

[Verse 2]
Dear Jonathan, I liked you too much
I used to be attracted to boys who would lie to me
And think solely about themselves
And you were plenty self-destructive for my taste at the time
I used to say the more tragic, the better
The truth is whenever I think of the early 90's
Your face comes up with a vengeance
Like it was yesterday

[Verse 3]
Dear Terrance, I love you muchly
You've been nothing but open hearted
And emotionally available and supportive
And nurturing and consummately there for me
I kept drawing you in
And pushing you away
I remember how beautiful it was to
Fall asleep on your couch and cry in front of you for the first time
You were the best platform from which to jump beyond myself
What was wrong with me?

[Verse 4]
Dear Marcus, you rocked my world
You had a charismatic way about you with the women
And you got me seriously thinking about spirituality
And you wouldn't let me get away with kicking my own ass
But I could never really feel relaxed and looked out for around you though
And that stopped us from going any further than we did
And it's kind of too bad because we could've had much more fun

[Verse 5]
Dear Lou, we learned so much
I realize we won't be able to talk for some time
And I understand that as I do you
The long distance thing was the hardest and we did as well as we could
We were together during a very tumultuous time in our lives
I will always have your back and be curious about you
About your career, your whereabouts",Alanis Morissette,1999,"[94, 78, 63, 58, 66, 75]",6

And all I can breathe is your life

Every day I wake up, I hope I'm dreamin'
I can't believe this shit
Can't believe you ain't here
Sometimes it's just hard for a nigga to wake up
It's just hard to just keep goin'
It's like I feel empty inside without you bein' here

Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin' on the block for dough
Notorious, they got to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone, we still a team
Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream (That's right)
In the future, can't wait to see
If you open up the gates for me
Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real, feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anythin' to hear half your breath (Half your breath)
I know you still livin' your life after death

[Refrain: Faith Evans & Puff Daddy]
Every step I take, every move I make

Memories give me the strength I need to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts Big I just can't define (Can't define)
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me takin' flicks
Makin' hits, stages they receive you on
Still can't believe you're gone (Can't believe you're gone)
Give anything to hear half your breath (Half your breath)
I know you still livin' your life after death

Somebody tell me why
One glad morning
When this life is over

I'd give anything and everything and I will always care
Through weakness and strength, happiness and sorrow
For better for worse, I will love you

Ya
REASON
Look this time it's darker nigga
This for the soul
Figure this shit out
Look

[Verse]
It's hard to handle the tragedy God givin' me
I mix revenge with apple juice and Hennessey
Combine that with a lost friend and memories
And there you have it, create a deadly savage
Boy this a story of young'ns who grew up with automatics
That made a living with robbin' like Paula Patton, uh
See this is what happens when there's money demand my nigga, shit
There's always money demands brotha
I done came from the bottom, stuck to the hustle
My niggas like ponytails we came from the struggle
Nigga look how I grew
My nigga shoulder to shoulder with me like crowded rooms
The blessings came raining down like showers do
I accept everything God gave me: The good, bad, the ugly
Lot of work to show a little growth, the flow's scruffy
So when I'm done I rather say I'm deservin' of it than lucky
Reason is standing on his own two
I used to be the guy but now I step out, fly
That's Clark Kent in the phone booth
Workin' hard to say that I got it
Boy, I'm tryna go from Dada to Prada, K-Swiss to Balenciagas
We work hard for most, weren't much given
I came up off Fila jackets and lunch tickets
Going broke, doing music, the grind harder than shell toes
Treat it like velcro, we stuck with it
From a bucket getter to a tough spitter
I earned blessings to duck bitches
Learned lessons, so fuck niggas
Niggas speak behind your back
Don't associate if you even gotta ask did he hate
That's Puff dissin'
Determination like good pussy, I dug in it
And look what came from it
It ain't the best if it ain't got my fuckin' name on it

I set my mind to it said I wasn't going to do it
No how, no sir, no way
I wouldn't give my heart up
Going to keep my guard up and save it for another
Then you walked in with that crazy grin and everything I swore before
Got lost in your eyes and flew right out the door

[Chorus]
Suddenly I heard love songs playing real soft on the jukebox
Somebody ordered up moonlight and painted stars all across the sky
Is it gravity or destiny? Either way there's nothing I can do
Looks like I picked the wrong night not to fall in love with you

[Verse 2]
I briefly resisted but my heart insisted it was going to be giving in
Hard as I was trying there was no denying which one of us would win
You came up beside me and asked if I'd be wanting to have a dance
Right then I knew this thing was out of my hands

Constantly, put the hustle down
With four or five niggas that's musclebound

Won't be satisfied, till I get my face on a thermos

Can't fake it, got to live it, or we gots to visit

And settle for crumbs and croutons

Hauling cars out to the coast

364,Talk Show Shhh!,"Who da hell you think you messin' wit
Tryin' to play me like a fool
I overheard a conversation
Between your ex-girlfriend and you
Then I saw it so clearly
Suddenly it all made since
Before you go on explaining yourself
Let me explain my evidence

[Chorus:]
No that's not my shade of lipstick
Or my scratch marks on your back
Is it her that you wanna be with
You got me involved in some talk show shit

I made the bed before work this mornin'
Come home later and there's new sheets on it
Your gonna lose the one your with
You got me involved in some talk show shit

I felt like you was hiding something
When you started showering alone
And someone used my Chanel perfume
Since this moment when I left home
You tiptoeing in the bedroom
While your thinking i'm asleep
If I catch your ass in one more lie
I'll be telling you to leave

No that's not my shade of lipstick
Or my scratch marks on your back

Ayo! Rhyme or crime, let's get it on
MC's wanna eat me but it's Ramadan
Peep what's on the arm, when it's ice it's ice
When I'm right, I'm right, when you're wrong, you're wrong
I'm the bomb, records is platinum, skin is bronze
Flows all night like vintage Dom
Been this nice since umm, the first Prince bomb
Before ""The Artist Was Known As"" wit my grown ass
Haters said it won't last, know how many birds I flown past
Celly on roam, full belly, first class
And I don't play, I watch them pockets
Know y'all niggas go broke after you cop them watches
See you in the club, no bub' nigga pop it
Then you wanna fuck, give it up nigga, not this

You ain't got dough, you can't go with the Fox bitch

Yo! Cats bustin out the six, cash flushin out the niggas
Platinum heart in half hangin 'tween the two tit-ties
Scheme on your team, lookin over graph pictures
Pick the finest, then I put it on the minors
Love, after the club, meet me at the diner
So you can bring your boys, we got ten cars behind us
Order a steak, a glass of OJ to break-fast
Hop in the car and head straight up Eighth Ave
The night is young, I'm likin son
Either he don't have one, or his wife is dumb
His whole hand numb, nigga iced his thumb
Pull up my tights some, enticin him
You can handle the work, I'll play wit it
Til he curve and swerve nigga, stay wit it
Bitches in the club they, hated it
Cause I put my mack down then I, skated it

You can catch me at the hot spot cause I Fox, I plots

366,If You Could Read My Mind,"[Verse 1]
If you could read my mind love
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old time movie
'Bout a ghost from a wishin' well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet
You know that ghost is me
And I will never be set free
As long as I'm a ghost that you can't see

[Verse 2]
If I could read your mind love
What a tale your thoughts could tell
Just like a paperback novel
The kind that drugstores sell
When you reach the part where the heartaches come
The hero would be me
But heroes often fail
And you won't read that book again
Because the ending's just too hard to take

[Verse 3]
I'd walk away like a movie star
Who gets burned in a three way script
Enter number two
A movie queen to play the scene
Of bringing all the good things out in me
But for now love, let's be real
I never thought I could act this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feelin's gone and I just can't get it back

[Verse 4]
If you could read my mind love
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an old time movie
'Bout a ghost from a wishin' well
In a castle dark or a fortress strong
With chains upon my feet
But stories always end
And if you read between the lines
You'll know that I'm just tryin' to understand
The feelin's that you lack
I never thought I could feel this way
And I've got to say that I just don't get it
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feelin's gone
And I just can't get it back",Gordon Lightfoot,1999,[99],1
367,You're Beginning To Get To Me,"I can't sleep at all
I'm making late night calls
Just to talk to you and hear your voice again
That flower shop on Main
Knows me by my first name
And how I want the card to read
And where I want the roses set

I'm not saying I'm in love
I'd admit it if I was
I'm just saying I believe
You're beginning to get to me
The way I need you all the time
The way you hold this heart of mine
I think it's time that I concede
You're beginning to get to me

I've got your picture up
On the dash of my new truck
So I can have you with me every road I'm on
Baby, what I feel
Is just a tip of what I will
I can only guess What I'll be like
When I'm completely gone

I'm not saying I'm in love

To see you with someone new

Like some guy you knew in school
Didn't we love, didn't we share
Or don't you even care
I know we said we were through
But I never knew how quickly I would go
From someone you loved to someone you used to know

Bet you didn't tell him about that weekend at the coast
Or how we used to argue about who loved who the most
Well, I guess I won that one,cause I still need you so
But to you I'm just someone you used to know

Like a friend, like a fool
Like some guy you knew in school
Didn't we love, didn't we share

At half past a heartache at quarter to four
Were you starting to worry I was finally getting over you
I almost forgot you looked so fine
If you told me some lies, it would be like old times
Just getting to see you is almost worth the things you do


You're easy on the eyes
Hard on the heart
You look so good but the way things look ain't the way they are
Better say goodbye
Before this goes too far
Cause now I realize you're easy on the eyes
Hard on the heart

I got to admit to you got a smile
That really reeled me in for awhile
But it ain't funny, honey, what you put me through
So why don't you send me your photograph
It'd hurt a lot less than taking you back
Then I could still have my favorite part of you


Cause you're easy on the eyes
Hard on the heart
You look so good but the way things look ain't the way they are
Better say goodbye
Before this goes too far
Cause now I realize you're easy on the eyes

Your heart is not open, so I must go
The spell has been broken, I loved you so
Freedom comes when you learn to let go
Creation comes when you learn to say no

You were my lesson I had to learn
I was your fortress, you had to burn
Pain is a warning that something's wrong

There's no place left to hide
There's no greater power

She goes direct to my heart
And when it comes to lovin' me
She's everything I need, bulls-eye perfect
She's right on the money

She's no red lights when I've overslept
She's a three point jump shot that's nothing but net
A hand full of aces, when the dealer's done dealin'
I'm forever on a roll, that's how she's got me feeling

[Chorus]
She's right on the money
She goes direct to my heart
And when it comes to lovin' me
She's everything I need, bulls-eye perfect
She's right on the money

She's the best cook that's ever melted cheese
I ain't much around the house, but I aim to please
There's absolutely no reason to doubt her
When she says I wouldn't last ten minutes without her

She goes direct to my heart

I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

[Chorus 1]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you, I am afraid

[Verse 2]
I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with

[Chorus 1]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust
Not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

[Bridge]
I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing

[Chorus 2]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I try my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid

378,One Week,"[Verse 1]
It's been one week since you looked at me
Cocked your head to the side and said, ""I'm angry""
Five days since you laughed at me, saying
""Get that together, come back and see me""
Three days since the living room
I realized it's all my fault, but couldn't tell you
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
But it'll still be two days 'til I say I'm sorry

[Verse 2: Ed Robertson]
Hold it now and watch the hoodwink
As I make you stop, think
You'll think you're looking at Aquaman
I summon fish to the dish, although I like the Chalet Swiss
I like the sushi 'cause it's never touched a frying pan
Hot like wasabi when I bust rhymes
Big like LeAnn Rimes, because I'm all about value
Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits
You try to match wits, you try to hold me but I bust through
Gonna make a break and take a fake
I'd like a stinking aching shake
I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavours
Gotta see the show, 'cause then you'll know
The vertigo is gonna grow
'Cause it's so dangerous, you'll have to sign a waiver

[Chorus]
How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Trying hard not to smile, though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean? Well, you soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of taking off my shirt

[Verse 3]
It's been one week since you looked at me
Threw your arms in the air and said, ""You're crazy""
Five days since you tackled me
I've still got the rug burns on both my knees
It's been three days since the afternoon
You realized it's not my fault not a moment too soon
Yesterday, you'd forgiven me
And now I sit back and wait 'til you say you're sorry

[Verse 4: Ed Robertson]
Chickity China, the Chinese chicken
You have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'
Watching X-Files with no lights on
We're dans la maison
I hope the Smoking Man's in this one
Like Harrison Ford, I'm getting frantic
Like Sting, I'm tantric
Like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy
Like Kurosawa, I make mad films, 'kay, I don't make films
But if I did they'd have a Samurai
Gonna get a set of better clubs
Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs
Just so my irons aren't always flying off the back-swing
Gotta get in tune with Sailor Moon
'Cause that cartoon has got the boom anime babes
That make me think the wrong thing

[Chorus]
How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Trying hard not to smile, though I feel bad
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral
Can't understand what I mean? You soon will
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve
I have a history of losing my shirt

[Verse 5]
It's been one week since you looked at me
Dropped your arms to the sides and said, ""I'm sorry""
Five days since I laughed at you and said
""You just did just what I thought you were gonna do""
Three days since the living room
We realized we're both to blame but what could we do?
Yesterday, you just smiled at me
'Cause it'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry

[Outro]
It'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry
It'll still be two days 'til we say ""Wasabi""

I'm so sick of these moments with you
Of staring at all these stars
Hand in hand like two liars
I swear sometimes I'd rather be dead
Just like the lights in your eyes
The lights of the town don't shine like they used to
How could I let this be?
Oh how could I let this be?
What have we got left except this long silence?
We're fading out as the night falls down
What have we got left expect this fucking distance that is standing
Right between us?

We're staring at each other, fade along the days (we're fading)
Denying a bitter end

To relive each of these lies
Hand in hand, like two liars

Baby, your dada loves you
And I'ma always be here for you no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin'
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

[Verse 1]
Come on Hai-Hai, we goin' to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let Dada strap you in the car seat
Oh, where's Mama? She's takin' a little nap in the trunk
Oh, that smell? Dada musta runned over a skunk
Now, I know what you're thinkin', it's kinda late to go swimmin'
But you know your Mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way she'll throw a fit
Don't play with Dada's toy knife, honey, let go of it! (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful?
Don't you wanna help Dada build a sandcastle? (yeah!)
And Mama said she wants to show you how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch ‚Äì it don't hurt
Her was eatin' dinner while you were sweepin'
And spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy, ain't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?

[Verse 2]
See, honey, there's a place called Heaven and a place called Hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And Dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one
‚ÄòCause Mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother, do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough
To understand a little better, I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say Mama was real, real bad
She was bein' mean to Dad and made him real, real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on timeout
Sit back in your chair, honey, quit tryna climb out!
I told you it's okay, Hai-Hai, want a ba-ba?
Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Dada change your didee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water

Wake up, sweepyhead, we're here, before we pway
We're gonna take Mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry, honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin' in her ear  (Mama!)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Dada made a nice bed for Mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help Dada tie a rope around this rock? (yea)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free
One, two, free ‚Äî whee! (woosh!)
There goes Mama, spwashin' in the water
No more fightin' with Dad, no more restrainin' order
No more stepdada, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell Mama you wuv her (Mommy!)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help Dad with two more things out the trunk

[Monica]
Boy, this evening, was it only me
Feeling completely down to be open
Down to be open for some satisfaction
Didn't wanna say yes, afraid of your reaction
I knew it was wrong for feeling this way
Especially the thought of getting in on the first date
Couldn't let go, it stayed on my mind
At the end of the night, I had to decide
I was thinking

[Chorus]
I should make a move but I won't (I should, I should)
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night
I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night

[Verse 2]
We were chillin, watching your TV
I thought you were coming close as you got to me
Wanted to touch you, wanted to kiss you
And somehow in one night, discover I love you
Felt so right but it felt so wrong
And look how we are carrying on
Try to say things to get me to stay
But my watch tells me it's getting too late
I'm thinking

I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night

I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night

(If) If you want me
You got to know me
And if you want my love
You gotta win my love

Hey baby
That's the way it's got to be, yeah
Get to know me, get to know me
So we can do this

I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night

I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night

I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night

I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night

I should make a move but I won't
I know you're probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night",Monica,1999,"[35, 23, 23]",3

400,Wide Open Spaces,"[Verse 1]
Who doesn't know what I'm talking about
Who's never left home, who's never struck out
To find a dream and a life of their own
A place in the clouds, a foundation of stone

[Verse 2]
Many precede and many will follow
A young girl's dreams no longer hollow
It takes the shape of a place out west
But what it holds for her, she hasn't yet guessed

[Chorus]
She needs, wide open spaces
Room to make her big mistakes
She needs, new faces
She knows the high stakes

[Verse 3]
She traveled this road as a child
Wide-eyed and grinning, she never tired
But now she won't be coming back with the rest
If these are life's lessons, she'll take this test

She needs, wide open spaces
Room to make her big mistakes
She needs, new faces
She knows the high stakes
She knows the high stakes

Aahhh aahhh aahhh
Aahhh aahhh aahhh

As her folks drive away her dad yells, ""Check the oil""
Mom stares out the window and says, ""I'm leavin' my girl""
She said, ""It didn't seem like that long ago""
When she stood there and let her own folks know

She needed, wide open spaces
Room to make her big mistakes

402,Westside,"Songtekst van Josylvio ‚Äì ""Westside"" ft. Killer Kamal & 3robi

[Verse 1: Josylvio]
Ik ging van rennen op de streets naar rennen op de beats
Wanneer ze vragen op bureau vertel ik helemaal niets
We blowen smoke in de jeep, roll alleen met de G's
Ze blijven plakken aan m'n body als die bitches me zien
Ik wil een brand new Benz en de banden verbranden
We hebben haast, a mattie
Nee we hebben geen tijd om te wachten
On the road voor die flappen, ik heb een zieke gedachte
Assie is van die zachte, stack niet onder matrassen
De attitude is ma3seb, kon nog weg bij Van Klasse
Maar ik ben real a mattie, hoef geen deal, a mattie
Je mag die voorschot bij je houden, ik ben hier, a mattie
Die rappers praten over gannoes voor de sier, a mattie
Als ik pull up met me jongens is het spel al gewonnen
Rook de hele dag dikke, denk niet eens aan m'n longen
Al die mannen gaan longen wanneer ik kom voor die prijs
Catch je ass wel ergens lacking, alles komt met de tijd

[Hook: Josylvio]
Je kan niet komen waar we staan, met m'n strijder in de laan
Ik geef geen fock om deze faam, ik ben nog steeds de same
We moven undercover, altijd zijn we ready voor cake
Ze vragen waar ga je heen, ik zeg alleen:
Je kan me vinden in de Westside
Je kan me vinden in de Westside

3robi, spow, pow, net een raket, ik stijg
Fuck de blauw mattie, sowieso ik zwijg
Gekke stress, ik rook een zuen voor m'n hoofd
Doe je lijp met je money wordt je beroofd
Net als Robben, a bradda, ik heb altijd dreiging
Drerrie robben voor money dat is gannoe bedreiging
Jongens zonder fucking baan op die linkerbaan
Shi gekke osso vol met doekoe wordt gekinkelt man
Lijpe loesoe bij een scotoe achtervolging
Veel bewegen op en neer, gaan net een vering
Drerrie op de street zijn op lijpe brakkinering
En die sel3a ceering, fuck reclassering
Welloe diploma, ik heb MDMA
Handschoenen mattie, scotoe wil die DNA
Wil shi gekke Benz, wil shi dikke CLA
Ik ben een gekke mens als ik gekke dingen klaar

Ewa, ik ben van Noord-Brabant, Eindhoven-Noord, Woensel-Noord
Ben gestoord, in m'n hoofd, zoals je hoort
Esko op de keyboard, Kamal aan de woord
Dus ja, er wordt gescoord, en de kechies zijn aan boord
Ik geef nooit antwoord aan de ibatrash (never)
Elke nacht op kantoor, geen ziektewet
Tien voor zes, in de ochtend, maar ik kan nog niet naar bed
Ik heb deze beat geliquideerd, als John Mieremet
Gooi de W van Woensel als Machiavelli
Trap je met m'n schoenzool als Balotelli
Alle rennende drerrie in Woensel-West, doe je best
Zoek je geld to keep your head up en voed je nest
En deze maatschappij is sabotage

It's the things you do
That have made me fall
So in love with you
You can have it all
What else can I do
Nothin' left to prove
It's the things you do

[Verse 1]
You touched my love line
So deep inside I
Never thought I'd feel so good
Oh no
No need to hide now
Open up your mind now
Let me make it understood
Because

Straight A plus the material I bust
But the things that you do
Keep me up and it's a must

Nobody ever said to me
All of the things we shared within

404,Whatcha Wanna Do?,"[Intro: Charlie Wilson]
And you can't keep runnin in and out of my life
Whatcha Wanna Do?
And you better change your ways and start treatin me right
(3x)

[Mia X]
I tried to feed you everything you needed
And if I wrote I love you in the sky, you probably wouldn't read it
Cause, you actin like it don't even matter no more
Sometimes, I feel we in a race, tryin to make it to the door
Is it that I bore you, is it someone else again?
Should we put this to an end, and maybe start again as friends
I'm tryin to be mature, but mentally, I'm so tired
And you can't even tell me why
I cry feelin stupid, used and alone
When it's four in the mornin and you still not home
Where did we go wrong, it used to be all gravy
Makin love all night, callin me your baby
But things got shady, now we ain't even close
Treat me like I should leave, and then don't want me to go
Sometimes I think I'm stuck, ?some say we goin on that path?
And then you raise me on the phone and please let you come back
Whatcha Wanna Do?

[Chorus:  Charlie Wilson]
Cause my heart is yearnin for your love
(2x)

[Mia X]
Now we been through all kinds of drama
But I'm the only other woman who loves you just as much as mama
I'm tryin to hold on, cause what we had was so deep
And in relationships, you got to take the bitter with the sweet
You keep runnin in and out, messin with my feelings
Playin with my mind and I know you see me trying
But even soldiers fall, remember when you fell
Remember the excuses and the lies I had to tell
?Put penance? for your bail, even though you gave me hell
When you was snortin more than half of what you had to sell
Put up with all your flings, hold my head, feelin sad
But through all the bull, you know it wasn't that bad
You used to make me laugh, show me love and respect
But if you don't make a change, you'll be callin me your ex
Can't keep runnin in and out
Can't keep runnin
Whatcha Wanna Do?
Whatcha Wanna Do?

[Chorus]

Cause my heart is yearnin for your, let me inside your love
My heart is yearnin for your, let me inside your love
Whatcha Wanna Do?

[Outro: Mia X(Charlie Wilson)]
Now what we gonna do?
I can't help but think of all the good times we had
When everything was so right
You know I can't pull all the weight by myself
And I feel like that's what I've been doin lately
It's a 50/50 love in a relationship, remember that
Now you runnin wild out here(Mama Mia, not gonna let you go baby)
Gamblin with all this foolishness in the streets
Whatcha gon cry about? (Mama Mia, not gonna let you go no)
You know what me and you had was real
Why you tryin to let it go?
If you wanna let it go, that's cool too(Mama Mia, not gonna let you go
Baby)
Cause I'm lookin for a Mr. DoRight
I was hopin it was you(Mama Mia, not gonna let you go no)
Cause when I first met you, that's what you was to me
Now Whatcha Wanna Do? (Mama Mia, not gonna let you go baby)
I ain't gonna keep askin you(Mama Mia, not gonna let you go no)
You already have two strikes
Think about it

Said ""I can do that
I can do that.""
Knew ev'ry step right off the bat
Said ""I can do that
I can do that.""

One morning sis won't go to dance class
I grab her shoes and tights and all
But my foot's too small, so
I stuff her shoes with extra socks
Run seven blocks
In nothin' flat
Hell, I can do that
I can do that

I got to class and had it made
And so I stayed
The rest of my life
All thanks to sis
(Now married and fat)
I can do this...

406,The Chanukah Song,"Okay...
This is a song that uhh..
There's a lot of Christmas songs out there and uhh..
Not too many Chanukah songs
So uhh..
I wrote a song for all those nice little Jewish kids who don't get to hear any Chanukah songs
Here we go...

Put on your yarmulke
Here comes Chanukah
So much funukah
To celebrate Chanukah

Chanukah is the festival of lights
Instead of one day of presents, we have eight crazy nights
When you feel like the only kid in town without a Christmas tree
Here's a list of people who are Jewish just like you and me

David Lee Roth lights the menorah
So do James Caan, Kirk Douglas, and the late Dinah Shore-ah
Guess who eats together at the Carnegie Deli
Bowser from Sha Na Na and Arthur Fonzerelli

Paul Newman's half Jewish, Goldie Hawn's half too
Put them together, what a fine lookin' Jew
You don't need ""Deck The Halls"" or ""Jingle Bell Rock""
Cause you can spin a dreidel with Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock-both Jewish

Put on your yarmulke
It's time for Chanukah
The owner of the Seattle Supersonicahs
Celebrates Chanukah

O.J. Simpson, not a Jew
But guess who is? Hall of famer Rod Carew-he converted
We got Ann Landers and her sister Dear Abby
Harrison Ford's a quarter Jewish-not too shabby

Some people think that Ebenezer Scrooge is
Well he's not, but guess who is
All Three Stooges!

So many Jews are in showbiz
Tom Cruise isn't, but I heard his agent is

Tell your friend Veronica
It's time to celebrate Chanukah
I hope I get a harmonicah
Oh this lovely, lovely Chanukah
So drink your gin and tonicah
And smoke your marijuanikah
If you really, really wannakah
Have a happy, happy, happy, happy Chanukah
Happy Chanukah",Adam Sandler,1999,"[98, 80]",2
407,We Really Shouldn't Be Doing This,"[Chorus]
We really shouldn't be doing this and we both know why
Just being close enough to think like this, enough to make you need to lie
This kinda talk will lead us to somewhere
We're getting way too close to going there
The farther off the better to resist, we really shouldn't be doing this

[Verse 1]
Only an isolated incident, but the acquaintance left me stunned
The first attraction was the hardest hit I thought I'd ever overcome
This kinda situation has to pass, this chance encounter has to be the last
To take it further we would be remiss, we really shouldn't be doing this

[Interlude]
We'd each be hurting somebody else if we don't say our good-byes real fast
Won't even think about a farewell kiss, we really shouldn't be doing this
Well

[Chorus]

[Outro]
This kinda situation has to pass, this chance encounter has to be the last

408,Don't Laugh At Me,"[Verse 1]
I'm a little boy with glasses
The one they call the geek
A little girl who never smiles
'Cause I've got braces on my teeth
And I know how it feels
To cry myself to sleep
I'm that kid on every playground
Who's always chosen last
A single teenage mother
Tryin' to overcome my past
You don't have to be my friend
Is it too much to ask?

[Chorus]
Don't laugh at me, don't call me names
Don't get your pleasure from my pain
In God's eyes, we're all the same
Someday we'll all have perfect wings
Don't laugh at me

[Verse 2]
I'm the cripple on the corner
You pass me on the street
I wouldn't be out here beggin'
If I had enough to eat
And don't think that I don't notice
That our eyes never meet
I lost my wife and little boy
Someone crossed that yellow line
The day we laid 'em in the ground
Is the day I lost my mind
Right now I'm down to holdin'
This little cardboard sign

[Chorus]
Don't laugh at me, don't call me names
Don't get your pleasure from my pain
In God's eyes, we're all the same
Someday we'll all have perfect wings
Don't laugh at me

[Bridge]
I'm fat, I'm thin, I'm short, I'm tall
I'm deaf, I'm blind, hey, aren't we all?

Don't laugh at me, don't call me names
Don't get your pleasure from my pain

Someday we'll all have perfect wings

When do you say ""I do""
When is the perfect time
To spend the rest of your life
Seasons may come and go
Sometimes it rains and snows
And there will be highs and lows
So only you will know

You never know just where it will find you
'Cause it can come on you so fast
Or seems like it takes forever
When you want it so bad
But don't ever take it for granted
'Cause it's more than sowing some seeds
It takes sun and water
So give it what it needs

That's how you fall in love
That's when you say ""I do""
That's when you know its time
To spend the rest of your life

410,A Little Past Little Rock,"I had to leave my life in Dallas
That town will always be you
And in every crowd on every corner
In every face I'd see you

So with nothing more than a tank of gas
I drove away without looking back
And I guess that's how I got where I am
Going anywhere as fast as I can

Now I'm a little past Little Rock
Further down the line
Too soon to know what's up ahead
Too late to change my mind
I've got to keep my heart out of this
And both hands on the wheel
I'm learning more with every mile
Just how leaving feels
It's a lonely stretch of blacktop
Out into the blue
Don't know where I'll go
Or what I'll do
I'm a little past Little Rock
But a long way from over you

These headlights on the highway
Disappear into the dark
And if I could have it my way
I'd go back to where you are

Oh, but I can't turn this thing around
And nothing short of the breaking down
Is gonna get me off this road I'm on
But I'm still a far cry from gone

Now I'm a little past Little Rock
Further down the line
Too soon to know what's up ahead
Too late to change my mind
I've got to keep my heart out of this
And both hands on the wheel
I'm learning more with every mile
Just how leaving feels
It's a lonely stretch of blacktop

Hope that it will last long
Bet them neighbors know my name like Trey Songz
Girl I'ma fuck you good
Get ya brag on
I'ma bend that ass over like the last song
Up down, up down and switches
Splash splash lemme switch positions
In the bedroom now we in the kitchen
Don't talk, don't talk just listen
I'm in it
Lets get it
I'm with it

[Hook]
Baby I'm yours no need to lie
Baby I'm yours no need to cry
You the one I adore no need to lie
And you mean so much more no need to cry
(And baby girl) You can lean on me
Ill be there so you can lean on me
Here's my shoulder you can lean on me
I won't leave so you can lean on me

[Verse 3]
11 o'clock
On the dot
I stole my pop's drop
I'm sittin' on yo street
I got a real sexy thing that I been textin' and she waitin' for me
Put it up
Put it out
Girl we out of town
The speed limit 70
Can we do 69
We can do it to the grind
Up and down 'round and 'round
And now she want some more
It's a rodeo

[Hook]
Baby I'm yours no need to lie
Baby I'm yours no need to cry
You the one I adore no need to lie
And you mean so much more no need to cry
(And baby girl) You can lean on me
Ill be there so you can lean on me
Here's my shoulder you can lean on me
I won't leave so you can lean on me",Skooly,1999,[99],1
412,It's Your Song,"[Verse 1]
Standing in the spotlight
On such a perfect night
Knowing that your out there listening
I remember one time
When I was so afraid
Didn't think I had the courage
To stand up on this stage
Then you reached into my heart
And you found the melody
And if there ever was somebody
Who made me believe in me
It was you
It was you

[Chorus]
It was your song that made me sing
It was your voice that gave me wings
And it was your light that shined
Guiding my heart to find
This place where I belong
It was your song

[Verse 2]
Every night I pray
Before the music starts to play
That I'll do my best and I won't let you down
And for all the times I've stood here
This feeling feels brand new
And any time I doubt myself I think of you

[Chorus]
Because It was your song that made me sing
It was your voice that gave me wings
And it was your light that shined
Guiding my heart to find
This place where I belong
It was your song

Dreams can come true
With God's great angels like you

[Outro]
It was your song that made me sing
It was your voice that gave me wings
And it was your light that shined
Guiding my heart to find
This place where I belong
It was your song
It was your song
It's always been your song",Garth Brooks,1999,[100],1
