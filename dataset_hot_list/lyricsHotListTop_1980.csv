0,(Just Like) Starting Over,"[Produced by John Lennon, Yoko Ono, and Jack Douglas; engineered by Lee DeCarlo and Jon Smith]

[Verse 1]
Our life together is so precious together
We have grown - we have grown
Although our love is still special
Let's take our chance and fly away somewhere alone

[Pre-Chorus]
It's been so long since we took the time
No-one is to blame
I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you darling
It's like we both are falling in love again
It'll be just like starting over - starting over

[Chorus]
Everyday we used to make it love
Why can't we be making love nice and easy
It's time to spread our wings and fly
Don't let another day go by my love
It'll be just like starting over - starting over

[Verse 2]
Why don't we take off alone
Take a trip somewhere far, far away
We'll be together, all alone again
Like we used to in the early days
Well, well, well darling

[Pre-Chorus]
It's been so long since we took the time
No-one is to blame
I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you darling
It's like we both are falling in love again
It'll be just like starting over - starting over

[Chorus]
Everyday we used to make it love
Why can't we be making love nice and easy
It's time to spread our wings and fly
Don't let another day go by my love
It'll be just like starting over - starting over

[Verse 3]
Our life together is so precious together
We have grown - we have grown
Although our love is still special
Let's take our chance and fly away somewhere...
Starting over",John Lennon,1980,"[1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 32, 38]",9
1,More Than I Can Say,"[Hook - Keyshia Cole]
I'm trying to put it all in words, but it's
More than I can say
It would take a whole lifetime to tell you
More than I can say
Every time I wrote a line it’s still
More than I can say
This is the realest shit I ever wrote
More than I can say

[Verse 1 - Nas]
Bottles and El Dorados, trapped in the allure
The sickness: dreaming of riches
Reality was the cure. My doctor
Physician was music, I'm sure
The prescription was super-model sandwiches
And suicide doors. I used to stand in my mirror
Fixing up my hat right
DMV don't make licenses for the fast life
Was taught never drop my head when I'm doing right
And though I may be watched by feds with the blue sights
I just want the whole world to bop their heads
Someone to stop my bread
If my pops was here, he'd be like ""son, you the one
They gotta crown you, a gift from around you
Know they don't understand you, but what can they handle?
If they was wearing Gucci loafers, they'd be through, over
Just stay on point, do what you do
Soldier: remember I'm with you when the world get colder..

[Hook - Keyshia Cole]

[Verse 2 - Nas]
Keep having the same dream
About a mic, a gun, a cross, they all
In the middle of flames
An hourglass of salt dripping down to its last grain
Hear a voice that asks what do I claim?
I ask what it means. It's sort of a trance
As the planet Earth appears in the palm of my hands
I could do what I wish with it, and waking up
To study my dreambook, see if it links up
Looking for some significance, like does the dream
Represent this cold world I'm living in?
Ask my man, then his laughter begin
He had the same dream, but in his, he grabbed the gun
Damn son! I told him in mine I took the mic
The cross, I had it all my life, the same height
I'm trying to sneak sleep, so that my mind won't find out
Time out: my body won't wind down",Nas,1980,"[2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 8, 9, 14, 20, 26, 35, 45, 60, 82]",14
2,Love On The Rocks,"She goes down slow like a shot of gin
She's got an angel's face and a devil's grin
She kinda stared me down as I looked her up
She said, ""I'm your poison, now you drink a cup""

In the heat of the night is when she comes alive
She's gonna push you, push you 'til she's satisfied
I watch the ice melt fast on her red hot lips
She whispers, ""If you wanna taste my love
Why don't you swallow this""

Love on the rocks, love on the rocks
She's my shot, love on the rocks

Oh lick it up

She gets so close you can feel her breathe
Just the way she moves, so soft and slippery
She lives just around the corner, right down the street
All night we play the horizontal bop right between her sheets

Love on the rocks, love on the rocks
She's my shot, love on the rocks

Love on the rocks, love on the rocks
Love on the rocks, love on the rocks",Poison,1980,"[3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 17, 23, 32]",9
3,Lady,"[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm fallin'
In all the good times
I find myself longing for change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm falling
In all the good times
I find myself longing for change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
In the sha-ha, sha-hallow
In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha, shallow
We're far from the shallow now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Oh, ha, ah, ha
Oh-ah, ha

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
In the sha-ha, shallow
In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha, shallow
We're far from the shallow now",Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper,1980,"[4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 6, 17, 20, 39, 99, 54, 28, 28, 30, 34, 46, 50, 58, 68, 77]",24
4,Hungry Heart,"[Verse 1]
Got a wife and kids in Baltimore, Jack
I went out for a ride and I never went back
Like a river that don't know where it's flowing
I took a wrong turn and I just kept going

[Chorus]
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Lay down your money and you play your part
Everybody's got a hungry heart

[Verse 2]
I met her in a Kingstown bar
We fell in love I knew it had to end
We took what we had and we ripped it apart
Now here I am down in Kingstown again

[Chorus]
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Lay down your money and you play your part
Everybody's got a hungry heart

[Verse 3]
Everybody needs a place to rest
Everybody wants to have a home
Don't make no difference what nobody says
Ain't nobody like to be alone

[Chorus]
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Lay down your money and you play your part
Everybody's got a hungry heart",Bruce Springsteen,1980,"[5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 18, 21, 30]",8
5,Every Woman In The World,"[Verse 1]
I think every woman in the world hates me
I got a little money but I still can't sleep
And though I'm shielded from the pretty faces
Their tongues still get to me

[Verse 2]
I can hear it in the way they look at me
And whisper to the others right behind my ears
Like, ""Yeah, he's kind of pretty and his songs ain't bad
But you know, I hear he is who he is

[Refrain 1]
Who he is
Who he is""

[Verse 3]
I think every woman in the world hates me
But lately I don't even need their help
See, I wonder if they might be right
It's been hard to stop myself

[Verse 4]
They say my biggest trouble seems to be patience
Oh, I never believed in wait and see
When you know you gotta go you outta go right then

[Refrain 2]
So go I did
Oh, I did
Oh, I did
Oh

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Outro]
I got lonely this weekend
So I ran away
It just got worse the more I wandered
And the more I paid
And I saw inside those women's eyes
As I turned to hate
See, I have fears and I have thoughts
But a fear of fact makes (?)
So until the hatred hails from someone else
I'll keep my mind and I'll keep trying
And I'll help myself",Zander Hawley,1980,"[6, 10, 11, 16, 19, 24, 35, 55, 71, 84]",10
6,Guilty,"[Intro: Mark Avery & Eddie]
Meet Eddie, 23 years old
Fed up with life and the way things are going
(Damn, I'm going fucking insane)
He decides to rob a liquor store
(I gotta take this shit, I can't take it no more, holmes)
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart
(Shit is mine)
And suddenly (I gotta do this)
His conscience comes into play (I gotta do this)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre, Eminem, & (Eddie)]
Alright, stop (Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (Who are you?)
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience
That's nonsense
Go in, gaffle the money, and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs
(Can I borrow this?)
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades
Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns
Fuck that, do that shit, shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (You're right)
Not over this shit (Stop)
Drop the biscuit (I will)
Don't even listen to Slim, yo, he's bad for you
You know what, Dre? I don't like your attitude

[Skit: Stan, Girl]
Come on, just come in here for a minute
I don't know
Look, look, look
Damn
Look, it's gonna be alright, alright?
O-okay
Look, give me a kiss, pull your pants off, come on

[Interlude: Mark Avery]
Meet Stan, 21 years old
After meeting a young girl at a rave party
Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom
Once again, his conscience comes into play

[Verse 2: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Now, listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
And smearin' her lipstick, slip this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair? (Uh-huh)
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot, bare
'Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there
Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie Kids?
No, but I seen the porno with Sun Doobiest
Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?
Man, fuck that, hit that shit raw dog, then bail

[Interlude: The Isley Brothers, Mark Avery, (Grady), & Grady's Wife]
Here I lay
(Man, it feels good to be home)
Meet Grady, a 29-year-old construction worker
After coming home from a hard day's work
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
To find his wife in bed with another man
(What the fuck?) Grady

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
Alright, calm down, relax, start breathin'
Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'
While you at work, she's with some dude tryna get off
Fuck slittin' her throat, cut this bitch's head off
Wait, what if there's an explanation for this shit?
What, she tripped, fell, landed on his dick?
Tsh, alright, Shady, maybe he's right, Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
Okay, thought about it? Still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
What you say?
What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?
I'ma kill you, motherfucker
Uh-uh, temper, temper
Mr. Dre, Mr. N.W.A, Mr. AK
Comin' straight outta Compton, y'all better make way
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that
Aw, fuck it, what am I sayin'?
Shoot 'em both, Grady, where's your gun at?",Eminem,1980,"[7, 8, 9, 14, 16, 20, 29, 43, 68]",9
7,The Tide Is High,"The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
I'm not the kinda man who gives up just like that
No

It's not the things you do that really hurts me bad
But it's the way you do the things you do to me
I'm not the kinda man who gives up just like that
No

The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
Number one
Number one

Every man wants you to be his girl
But I'll wait, my dear, 'til it's my turn

I'm gonna be your number one

The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one",The Paragons,1980,"[8, 11, 20, 32, 38, 58, 81]",7

[Verse 1: Bizarre]
Proof died, what happened? (What happened?)
Marshall stopped rapping (Damn!)
I guess that makes me the captain (Uh-huh)
Hit the mattress (Okay)
Pistol-packing (Uh-huh), sick assassin (Yeah)
Hit the gas and (Okay), get to mashing
D12 broke up? Who you bitches asking?
Our clique's relaxing in the hills of Aspen
Popping pills and Aspirin
And I'm the machine that brought Marshall back to life
Told him that my rhymes just have to be tight
So I figured that I would grab the mic
Like a nigga 'bout to rhyme right after Christ
Sometimes we get mad and fight, right back to the lab tonight
Grab an O and I have to light
That's only right, living like a rock star is the only life!
And we are six grown men who are old friends
To my nigga Bugz, DeShaun Holton
All the way down, I'ma hold them
D12 nigga, 'til the world end (D12!)

[Chorus: Pat Benatar]
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!

[Verse 2: Swifty]
A lot of niggas try to underestimate me
'Til I come back with vengeance and slice their trachea
Y'all been placed on a contract for hating
I'ma waste them, one by one, for tainting
My ability to kill a facility, I'ma send them to Satan
Fast as a child rapist facing
Life or trifle, Henny has made me in waiting
They gon' lock me up under the basement
I'm a one-man army, marine, and navy
You done made me angry, I'm crazy, insane
And maybe I bite the face of your baby
For anyone who try to diss Proof or Hailie
I'ma break their Halo
Put them on the reaper's payroll
Erase them and hang their soul
It ain't no hoes here, McVay got a scroll
With names on it, dipped in blood, man I'm cold

[Chorus: Pat Benatar]
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!

[Verse 3: Kuniva]
I know you thought we were done, we rose up
Got a gun to make your whole inside fold up
They hit us with the best shot and we're still standing
So tell the world it can lick our scrotum
Straight soldiers, who wanna stunt?
Who wanna be the fall guy? Who want the pump?
Who wanna get slumped just for looking at me sideways
Every time I roll up I'ma keep it blunt
Where did y'all run when we almost lost Marshall?
Y'all did it big like Costco
And we back in this bitch like a tampon
Still, talk dirty, Em's clean like a bar of soap
And you will soon slip on some buffoon shit
My hand's on a sweeper, yours on a broomstick
So stop looking all stupid, I'm rude and abusive
And strapped, don't make me use it

[Chorus: Pat Benatar]
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place! (A'ight, here's where I come in at)

[Verse 4: Eminem]
I came in this game with bad intentions
And I ain't budged, not even an inch since then
I'm stubborn, evil, and insensitive
I'm like nothing you ever seen, pencil in
Hand, it's like I'm holding the insulin
So you might wanna button it like Benjamin
I ain't frightened of nothing, I injure men
Step right in this mark with my henchmen and
Walk, straight to the stage
I ain't here to cause trouble, get the fuck out my face
Fall back, little cocksucker
I ain't A&W, don't get your cold mugs in my way
Get 'em? Shattered, fucking A
Been this way since B.C., what can I say?
I'm stuck in my ways like double stick tape
Don't get turned to a vegetable, dick face!
You ain't Superman, stay in your lane, Lois
D12 spitting flames like flamethrowers
Spit 'til we get sprained jaws with metaphors
That cut with the same force as chainsaws
Hope you're coming with your A game
'Cause things have changed in this game
Isn't the same game, boys
The stakes have been raised, better make lemonade
When they give you lemons, if they want us, let 'em aim for us

[Chorus: Pat Benatar]
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Hit me with your best shot!
Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!",Eminem,1980,"[9, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 19, 25, 33, 40, 55, 73]",13
9,Tell It Like It Is,"[Produced by Omen]

[Karma] Daddy is that your car on TV?

[Ludacris]
You better believe it is baby
Now go in the other room
It's about to be some grown folks talkin here, okay?
All right

Yeah, things ain't always what they seem or cracked up to be (okay)
Like all these fakin ass rappers in this industry (tell 'em!)
Talkin 'bout what they got and they ain't got a damn thang
How you own three cars but you don't own your own name? (woo!)
Get your business right boys, the first class is in session (okay)
Get a entertainment lawyer in the music profession (hey!)
Start up your own company, trademark the name
That's gon' run ya about a grand so start savin your change (DTP!)
Open a bank account quick and then follow these steps (uh-huh)
Sign yourself TO yourself and start signin ya own checks (woo!)
Hit the booth and start recordin at the speed and need
Whatever gets your juices flowin, could be speed or weed (what else?)
Get it mixed and mastered (hey) pressed up and plastered (okay)
Sell it to your whole hood out the trunk, ya bastard!
Show all the non-believers what you destined to be (hey!)
And in just a couple years you could be rich like me!

[Hook: Ludacris]
But I can't hold my tongue - I'mma tell it like it is
This biz ain't all fun - I'mma tell it like it is
Give it to you straight, no chase - I'mma tell it like it is
Look you straight in yo' face and I'mma tell it like it is
I can't hold my tongue - I'mma tell it like it is
This biz ain't all fun - I'mma tell it like it is
Give it to you straight, no chase - I'mma tell it like it is
Look you straight in yo' face and I'mma tell it like it is

[Ludacris]
See mostly all your favorite artists got some serious problems (yup)
Their money could be the problem but money can't solve 'em (nope)
Some get addicted to drugs and flat out lazy (woo)
Some taste a little fame and go flat out crazy (woo!)
I'm close cause those close wanna live off my fame (yup)
And that type of shit ALONE'll drive a nigga insane (crazy!)
Not to mention all the vultures, the scandalous promoters (okay)
Crabs'll try to sue you, magazines'll misquote ya
Most of these label heads, they don't care nothin about ya (nah)
If you stop sellin records they'll act like they don't know ya
It's hard mixin business with pleasure so don't play
Me and my crew argue and fight like every other DAY (for real!)
Rappers ain't above the law but our life is so fast
That we got a special task force of police on our ass (true that)
All that, and this is really just the start of it (just the start of it)
Hip-Hop! You really wanna be a part of it?

[Hook: Ludacris]
Woo! I can't hold my tongue - I'mma tell it like it is
This biz ain't all fun - I'mma tell it like it is
Give it to you straight, no chase - I'mma tell it like it is

Hey hey, I can't hold my tongue - I'mma tell it like it is
Man this biz ain't all fun - I'mma tell it like it is
I'mma give it to you straight, no chase - I'mma tell it like it is
Hey! Look you straight in yo' face and I'mma tell it like it is

[Ludacris]
Let's go!
What's worse than havin no money is havin it and losin it (yup)
What's worse than havin some money is grabbin and abusin it (yup)
We never took no money from Chingy, thought I was cool with him (nah)
I wish his ass well but I don't want NOTHIN to do with him (woo!)
Some don't own they publishin; me? I never fool with 'em (nah)
I'm down for my artists, try my best to stay true to 'em (believe it)
Cause outside my label competition is irrelevant (DTP!)
Unless I'm still in competition with my president (what up Jay?)
And believe that I'm supportin the Hova
Cause the industry's shady, it needs to be taken over (okay!)
But the first rule to accumulation of wealth (what's that?)
Is don't trust nobody but your GOD damned self!

[Hook: Ludacris]
Woo! I can't hold my tongue - I'mma tell it like it is
Man this biz ain't all fun - I'mma tell it like it is
I'mma give it to you straight, no chase - I'mma tell it like it is
Look you straight in yo' face and I'mma tell it like it is

Look you straight in yo' face and I'mma tell it like it is

10,Passion,"[Intro: Moodymann]
Hold on, hold on, fuck that. Fuck that shit. Hold on, I got to start this mothafuckin' record over again, wait a minute. Fuck that shit. Still on this mothafuckin’ record. I'ma play this mothafucka for y'all. Ayy, y’all get some more drinks goin' on, I'll sound a whole lot better.

[Verse 1]
Listen
Seein' you got ritualistic
Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now
'Cause I'm fallin' apart, yeah
Tension
Between us just like picket fences
You got issues that I won’t mention for now
’Cause we're fallin’ apart

[Chorus]
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can’t blame you, no, no

[Verse 2]
Listen
Harder buildin' trust from a distance
I think we should rule out commitment for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart
Leavin'
You're just doing that to get even
Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep fallin' apart

[Chorus]
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no

11,"De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da","[Verse 1]
Don't think me unkind
Words are hard to find
The only cheques I've left unsigned
From the banks of chaos in my mind
And when their eloquence escapes me
Their logic ties me up and rapes me

[Chorus]
De do do do, de da da da
Is all I want to say to you
De do do do, de da da da
Their innocence will pull me through
De do do do, de da da da
Is all I want to say to you
De do do do, de da da da
They're meaningless and all that's true

[Verse 2]
Poets, priests, and politicians
Have words to thank for their positions
Words that scream for your submission
And no one's jamming their transmission
Because when their eloquence escapes you
Their logic ties you up and rapes you

[Chorus]
De do do do, de da da da
Is all I want to say to you
De do do do, de da da da
Their innocence will pull me through

12,Master Blaster (Jammin'),"[Verse 1]
Everyone's feeling pretty
It's hotter than July
Though the world's full of problems
They couldn't touch us even if they tried
From the park I hear rhythms
Marley's hot on the box
Tonight there will be a party
On the corner at the end of the block

[Chorus]
Didn't know you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
I bet nobody ever told you that you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
You would be jamming and jamming and jamming, jam on

[Verse 2]
They want us to join their fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away
Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third World's right on the one
Now's the time for celebration
Because we've only just begun

[Chorus]
Didn't know you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
I bet nobody ever told you that you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
You would be jamming and jamming and jamming, jam on

[Verse 3]
You ask me am I happy
Well as matter of fact
I can say that I'm ecstatic
Because we all just made a pact
We've agreed to get together
Joined as children in Jah
When you're moving in the positive
Your destination is the brightest star

Ooh, let's go!

[Verse 1]
Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go
Are you ready? Hey, are you ready for this?
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat, yeah

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust

[Verse 2]
How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you, when you're gone
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy, are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Look out

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust

There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him, you can cheat him, you can treat him bad
And leave him when he's down, yeah
But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating the sound of the beat

Take some time and check on me

Tell the preacher before he judge
Okay y'all, just say a prayer
Write it on a paper plane
Do me a favor, throw  it in the air

You keep saying, ""Quit the game""
Don't you know we play to win?
Racing with my lady friend
Chopped chopped on that 'Cedes Benz

See the way them rims is spinnin'?

15,I Made It Through The Rain,"We dreamers have our ways
Of facing rainy days
And somehow we survive

We keep the feelings warm
Protect them from the storm
Until our time arrives

Then one day the sun appears
And we come shining through those lonely years

I made it through the rain
I kept my world protected
I made it throught the rain
I kept my point of view
I made it through the rain
And found myself respected
By the others who
Got rained on too
And made it through

When friends are hard to find
And life seems so unkind
Sometimes you feel afraid

Just aim beyond the clouds
And rise above the crowds
And start your own parade

Cause when I chased my fears away
That's when I knew that I could finally say

I made it through the rain
I kept my world protected
I made it throught the rain
I kept my point of view
I made it through the rain
And found myself respected
By the others who
Got rained on too
And made it through...

In the prime of my life I'll remember you
Living and breathing and some misbelieving

All that I give to you

Don't give me no time to waste away

Keep me alive to my dying day

And love will make it all right, all right

Time it goes on waits for nothing on over
But I still see your sun that you shine on me
Giving and taking and always mistaking
But I'll follow you woman , eternally

Waiting for your love

Life is a moment in space
When the dream is gone, it's a lonelier place
I kissed the morning goodbye
But down inside you know we never know why
The road is narrow and long
When eyes meet eyes and the feeling is strong
I turn away from the wall
I stumble and fall but I give you it all

I am a woman in love and I do anything
To get you into my world and hold you within
It's a right, I defend
Over and over again
What do I do

[Verse 2]
With you eternally mine
In love there is no measure of time
We planned it all at the start
That you and I live in each other's heart
We may be oceans away
You feel my love, I hear what you say
No truth is ever a lie
I stumble and fall but I give you it all

I am a woman in love and I do anything
To get you into my world and hold you within
It's a right, I defend

22,Suddenly,"[Verse 1]
I swear this famous shit just happened overnight
For sure these hoes was so uptight, but now they so polite
All I see is fake love, smiles, and overbites
But I'm pimping, nigga: Dolemite
I remember when, I was like ten, maybe nine
Ricky had a deuce-deuce, two shotty pumps with a baby nine
Busta had the rhymes, Puffy had the Shyne
Bone Thugs had Mo Thugs but that was the shit, that made me rhyme
What's up, what's on your mind? Hold up, I'm feeling fine
Locs got me blind, thugging like I'm Eazy-E up in his prime
Another young nigga with a attitude
I guess that's why the crackers kept me after school
Roaches on the wall, roaches on the dresser
Everybody had roaches but our roaches ain't respect us
On the park bench playing checkers, sipping nectar
Girbaud jeans with hologram straps and reflectors
We had cookouts and dirt bikes and dice games and fistfights
And fish fries and shootouts like one Sig with two rounds
And one click left two down, that's four kids but one lived
Left three dead, but one split, that one miss, that one snitched
That's everyday shit, shit we used to that
Add it up, do the math with your stupid ass
Don't view me as no conscious cat, this ain't no conscious rap
Fuck the conscious crap, my mac'll push your conscience back
I do this for my culture, penny, nickels in the sofa
Mommy watching Oprah, Daddy in the kitchen whipping soda
Cook-connect named Sosa, Spanish chick Viola hit it in the chocha
With the Testarossa, hit Daytona, fuck the law, we soldiers
I'm 'bout it 'bout it, nigga ain't shit sweet about me
The baddest bitches on the block be even speaking 'bout me
I'm so thuggish ruggish bringing ruckus, knucking if you bucking
Young and thugging, bugging showing out in public, but you love it

[Bridge]
I only got one vision, that's for kids in every color, religion
That listen, we gotta beat the system, stay the fuck out the prisons
They try to blind our vision, but we all God children, we siblings
You my brother, you my kin, fuck the color of your skin

[Verse 2]
Back once again
Chilling in the back of the 'Lac with a pass or the gin
Finna ask can I pass to her friend
Then a nigga smash, I'll be damned if I ask her again
Gold slabs on the 'Lac when I spin
Then it's back to the back of the Benz
Lean back in the back with the Henn and a crap
When I tap that that, then attack, never tax, never that that
Max on the ends, spend ends, I remember way back when
A mothafucka used to have to borrow cash from my friends
Friends, just to put a snack up in the fridge
When I'm on, I swear to God to pay you back
Now the kids all look up to me
Them bitches wanna fuck with me
My idols say what's up to me
From ugly to comfortably, suddenly

[Outro]
It all changed man, it was just like yesterday
Times was so ugly and now I'm comfortable
I just only can thank God, suddenly
Everything changed before my eyes by my surprise

23,I Believe In You,"[Verse 1]
I don't believe in superstars
Organic food and foreign cars
I don't believe the price of gold
The certainty of growing old
That right is right and left is wrong
That north and south can't get along
That east is east and west is west
And being first is always best

[Chorus 1]
But I believe in love
I believe in babies
I believe in mom and dad
And I believe in you

[Verse 2]
Well I don't believe that heaven waits
For only those who congregate
I like to think of God as love
He's down below, he's up above
He's watchin' people, everywhere
He knows who does and doesn't care
And I'm an ordinary man
Sometimes I wonder who I am

[Chorus 2]
But I believe in love
I believe in music
I believe in magic
And I believe in you

[Bridge]
I know with all my certainty
What's going on with you and me
Is a good thing
It's true
I believe in you

[Verse 3]
I don't believe virginity
Is as common as it used to be
In working days and sleeping nights
That black is black and white is white
That Superman and Robin Hood
Are still alive in Hollywood
That gasoline's in short supply
The rising cost of gettin' by

25,One Step Closer,"[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I've said before
All these words they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Less I hear, the less you'll say
You'll find that out anyway

(Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
('Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break)

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again

After the struggle and the pain
And to remain in the game
Shit'll never be the same no more
After you grind and survive
And you grind and you grind
Shit'll never be the same no more
I know cheated a million times
And you caught me in so many lies
Shit'll never be the same no more
I ain't lyin', I ain't lyin', I ain't lyin'
Shit'll never be the same no more

[Verse 1:]
I was standing in the rain in the middle of the trenches
Running from polices, jumping over fences
Serving in the them hotboxes living life relentless
Taking penitentiary chances still dodging the penitentiary
The teachers taught my cousins go to school and you done listen
Make your outlook on life different, damn you look suspicious
My granddad died a boss, and that's been on my memory
If you listen closer to me, feel the pain in my delivery
The struggle and the pain, I still remain the same
I'm grinding so hard I'm just strengthening up my brain
Flyer then the plain, moving faster then the train
Get the fuck up out my lane, some things gotta change

After the struggle and the pain
And to remain in the game

I ain't lyin', I ain't lyin', I ain't lyin'
Shit'll never be the same no more

[Verse 2:]
Damn it feel like yesterday I'm at the corner store
When the po-po ran up on me in Mexico
I dropped the blow I swear I never ran that fast before
And when I play it back in my memory in the studio
I swear I grind and I grind going hard every time
Going hard on my grind
Selling damaged bricks, shit be at a bunch of licks
I write a hundred songs every time I think of this
Take a 2 liter fill it up with codeine
Let's take a toast to all my niggas who ain't here with me
And I'm a ride I'm a ride
Until the rubber off the tires, only the strong survive

These scars on me permanently, this pain insides burning me
But it ain't killing me, It's boosting up my energy
I'm on my way to Tennessee, doing a show for 10 a key
And these streets they're a beast out here
I don't plan on coming home I might leave you this year
And shawty I know you ride for a nigga
But you get tired of a nigga, tired of crying over your nigga
So many lies, so many broken promises
I hate it come to this, I took you through a bunch of shit
Feel good to your side, I tried to buy you a bunch of shit
But you don't take it no more, you sick and tired of it

Would deserve a fair promotion

Just to watch them shatter

On the boss man's ladder

Your ship will come in
And the tide's gonna turn

Girls have more fun
Girls have their way
To get lovers anytime they want
Anytime she needs some lovin'
Anytime she just gives a sign
It won't take her long to find a man to oblige

Guys got to plot
Guys got to plan
Guys got to lie, cheat, steal
Do anything he can
Anything to get her to love him
Anything to make her agree
That's the way it's been since Adam and Eve

Girls can get it anytime they want
Girls can get it where a man often won't
Everybody's always after some lovin' now and then
A woman gets it faster than any man can

Girls can get it anytime they like
Girls can get it a fact of life
If she calls you for some lovin' in the middle of the night
She can get a man runnin' at the speed of light

We all look for love
Somewhere, sometime
Girls find it first
They find it morning, noon and night
And it's a wonder of nature, eighth wonder of the world
That a man's got to chase her if he's gonna get the girl

Oh, when a woman wants love
A woman gets love
And it's for sure she's gonna find it
Before the sun comes up

Girls can get it, they pick and choose
Girls can get it, men are always in the mood
If she calls you for some lovin' in the middle of the night
She can get a man runnin' at the speed of light

Girls can get it anytime they like
Girls can get it a fact of life
Oh, you know she'll find it easy
You know that she can

Beside the victory

Thinking I'd be strong there

Why should I complain? (Why complain)

Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same when she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say? Rules must be obeyed

The judges will decide (They decide)
The likes of me abide (We abide)
Spectators of the show (Of the show)
Always staying low (Staying low)

36,Same Old Lang Syne,"[Verse 1]
Met my old lover in the grocery store
The snow was falling Christmas Eve
I stole behind her in the frozen foods
And I touched her on the sleeve

[Verse 2]
She didn't recognize the face at first
But then her eyes flew open wide
She went to hug me and she spilled her purse
And we laughed until we cried

[Verse 3]
We took her groceries to the checkout stand
The food was totaled up and bagged
We stood there lost in our embarrassment
As the conversation dragged

[Verse 4]
Went to have ourselves a drink or two
But couldn't find an open bar
We bought a six-pack at the liquor store
And we drank it in her car

[Chorus]
We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to now
And tried to reach beyond the emptiness
But neither one knew how

[Verse 5]
She said she'd married her an architect
Who kept her warm and safe and dry
She would have liked to say she loved the man
But she didn't like to lie

[Verse 6]
I said the years had been a friend to her
And that her eyes were still as blue
But in those eyes I wasn't sure if I
Saw doubt or gratitude

[Verse 7]
She said she saw me in the record stores
And that I must be doing well
I said the audience was heavenly
But the traveling was hell

[Chorus]
We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to now
And tried to reach beyond the emptiness
But neither one knew how

We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to time
Reliving in our eloquence
Another 'auld lang syne'

[Verse 8]
The beer was empty and our tongues were tired
And running out of things to say
She gave a kiss to me as I got out
And I watched her drive away

[Verse 9]
Just for a moment I was back at school
And felt that old familiar pain
And as I turned to make my way back home
The snow turned into rain

These young niggas think I fell out the loop
'Cause the last time they seen me hopping out the Coupe
I hopped out in a suit
Look at this nigga Jay fronting, trying to take my shine
I didn't say this verbally, just had some shit on my mind
Plus I'm puffing like an ounce more than I used to puff
Taking advice from these niggas but they ain't used to stuff
They had me thinking, ""Shit, I'm the one that moved the stuff
While he drive around town in brand new Coupes and stuff""
Swear to God, they had me practically hating his guts
As he approached I spoke, ""Jigga, whattup?""

[Chorus: Memphis Bleek & (Jay-Z)]
I done came up (uhh), put my life on the line (uhh)
Soaked the game up (yeah), now it's my time to shine
Time to change up (what?), no more second in line
Nine-eight, these streets is mine
(Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh-uh-huh-uh-huh)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z & Memphis Bleek]
Look at that fake smile he just gave me, it's breaking my heart
Should I school him or pull the tools out and just break him apart?
I felt his hatred it was harsh -- 'fore this faking shit start
I should take him in back of the building and blaze him
Uh-oh, this nigga Jay, he ain't slow, he musta picked up on the vibe
But had I not been so high, I woulda been able to hide
Tried to cover up myself, as I gave him a five
Hugged him as if I loved him, to the naked eye
It woulda seemed we was the closest, but to those that know us
Could see that something was about to go down
Stay focused, I'm trying to concentrate
But it's like he's reading my mind
As if he can see through this fog and all this weed in my mind
Could he see I had plans on, being the man
Ever since we first spoke and he put that G in my hand
And I gave it back to show him, I was down for the cause
As he approached (""Whattup Bleek?"") and I paused

[Chorus: Memphis Bleek & Jay-Z]
I done came up (uhh), put my life on the line (uhh)
Soaked the game up (yeah), now it's my time to shine
Time to change up (what?), no more second in line
Nine-eight, these streets is mine
Yeah, you done came up (uhh), put your life on the line (uhh)
Soaked the game up (uhh), now it's yo' time to shine (yeah)
Time to change up, no more second in line
Nine-eight, these streets is mine

[Verse 3: Jay-Z & Memphis Bleek]
Right, yo we wild out in Vegas, styled on haters
Mouthed off at the cops, outta cranberry drops
Copped whips the same color, we tighter than brothers
With different fathers but same mothers, this life don't love us
So 'til death do us, I'm never breaking my bond
Nigga, we Lex movers, V-12 pushers
As I stand
One leg of my pants up, in a stance like, ""And what?""
I know these niggas are feeding my mind cancer
But in time's the answer (woo!)
Seems mind-blowing, this weed and Hennessy
Got my mind going, trust me nigga, I'm knowing
Chicks used to ignore me
And my aunt saying I need 50, not 60/40
Oh God, don't let him control y'all
Your gun is my gun, your clip is my clip, baby
Your fun is my fun (uh huh), your bitch is my bitch
Any nigga trying to harm Jay, I'm feeling for you
I ain't only touching you, I'm killing your crew
Give it a year, you'll be sitting on a million or two
Records sold, nigga, perfect your role, geah

[Chorus: Memphis Bleek, (Jay-Z) & Both]
I done came up (uhh), put my life on the line
Soaked the game up (yeah), now it's my time to shine
Time to change up (what?), no more second in line
Nine-eight, these streets is mine (geah, geah)
I done came up (came up), put your life on the line (uhh)
Soaked the game up (game up), now it's yo' time to shine
Time to change up (change up), no more second in line
Nine-eight, these streets is mine

[Outro: Jay-Z]
Yeah, you done came up, put your life on the line
Soaked the game up, now it's yo' time to shine

[Verse 1]
You should have seen by the look in my eyes
That there was somethin' missin'
You should have known by the tone of my voice
But you didn't listen
You play dead, but you never bled
Instead you lie still in the grass all coiled up and hissin'

[Verse 2]
And I know all about those men
Still I don't remember
'Cause it was us, baby, way before them
And we're still together

[Pre-Chorus]
And I meant every word I said
When I said that I love you I meant that I love you forever

And I'm gonna keep on lovin' you

(coughs) I think I'm getting sick
Been in this room, like all the time

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Look, I'm posing a question
How many been empty and holding aggression?
Close to depression
Open your eyes and just focus a second
Fuck a recession, my brother
My mind is my weapon, I'm letting it go
Loading and pointing at negative energy
Telling me stop, they're telling me, ""No, don't""
Your aura is something you ain't even sure of
Explore the core of California, whores got more to snort up
I've had a smorgasbord of pornographic thought
That's a lot, the feeling come after the shock
Praise me I'd rather you not
Cause it's driving me crazy
The fact that you pay amaze me that's something I love
You come to the club searching for drugs
Drunk, fucking these sluts
God loves me, what if he does, what does it mean?
You're wasting away doing nothing, you're fronting
Why ain't you chasing your dreams, uh?
We wonder 'bout life but none of us willing to learn
The money we earn is something to burn
Why won't they give me a turn out?
Feed the hungry and clothe the naked
You're mistaken, the world is cold and it's lonely, ain't it?
When 'em high roller homes in Vegas
Raid 'em with some home invasions
Contaminating the place with plague, we just saved the day
I waste away in a room spitting these raps
Yahweh put the world in my hands, I'm giving it back, yeah

[Hook: Niki Randa]
It's a gift
Our, our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle

It's a gift
Our, our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Forfeit in the war, he lays a sword down and walks away
Grabs a 40 from the corner store and begins to contemplate
Dealing with death like he work in the morgue, absorbing the souls
Forgotten, he lost his way
Starring down that barrel, thinking not today
Life's so precious, Lord knows that life is so precious
Fight to the death, 'til there's nobody left
You're holding your breath because you might get infected
I'm animalistic, instinctively thinking I'm getting ballistic
Be specific, to those who in control we all statistics
Misogynistic with a twisted mind, I'm intertwined
My trigger finger itching, all I kill is time
Initial symptoms of schizophrenic behavior
The mind is like religion, can't agree on who's its savior
The newest flavor of superhero, I'm shooting lasers
Except I'm cool with Vader
And blowing up rooms that's full of strangers
A news anchor, the youth can relate to, it's nature
If you're a hater, I'll deal with you later, no thank you
I'm just your neighbor, please don't do me no favors
Really doe, come on homie, we major
I waste away in this room spitting out raps
Yahweh put the world in my hands, I'm giving it back

[Outro: Ab-Soul]
It's just a different time, man, it's just a different time
There was a time, when we showed love
You know like how we, approach a young lady
You see a beautiful young lady you like
You say ""Damn, man, you're gorgeous""
I'll take off my coat right now and
Lay it down on the puddle and, make sure you don't miss a step
You know what I'm talking bout, young man?
See all these bitches, hoes and... thots? I just don't understand it

40,Cold Love,"[Verse 1]
Not whole, not wholly separate, but syncopated
Single in our nature, and because of the times
Not a word was said when the lights came on
Or a glance given pause at the cost of our desired wrongs
It's second nature to love you, it's first to die
And we were killed upon waking, killed upon waking to the life
We weren't prepared to live but rebelled to realize
We were killed upon the pavement, Bonnie we're immortalized in

[Chorus]
Blood, cold, cold love, we were still young
When the radio lights came on
Elton's on the air, no fair dear that we were still here
In the absence of everything, abstain from fear
And if I cry in your arms
Just some other shit, just some other shit
Just some other things that I've been dealing with
I'd die in your arms, bury me while playing this
Bury me saying ""You were all I ever needed""
And hold me like we're dying from the liquor that we drank
Down in hotel rooms, to feel warm in cold love

[Verse 2]
What's harder, harder to say?
That you want me to stay
That you want me to stay unchanged for you?
Chained to a lie, we're the same, you and I, we're the same
Not the same, we hurt differently, but consistent in our pain
Equal and equidistant in the way we laugh
To lay bare the weight of our cold love affair
Recalling the days where we were, we weren't, we were
Wrong for the papers, wrong for the dinner tables
Of the inner rings of the rich and famous anythings
It's gone, not bad, just gone, my bad, just wrong, we had
And we had, and we were then in

[Chorus]
Blood, cold, cold love, we were still young
When the radio lights came on
Elton's on the air, no fair dear that we were still here
In the absence of everything, abstain from fear
And if I cry in your arms
Just some other shit, just some other shit
Just some other things that I've been dealing with
I'd die in your arms, bury me while playing this
Bury me saying ""You were all I ever needed""
And hold me like we're dying from the liquor that we drank
Down in hotel rooms, to feel warm

What's harder, harder to say?
That you want me to stay
That you want me to stay unchanged for you?
Chained to a lie, we're the same, you and I, we're the same
What's harder, harder to fake?
That you want me to stay
That you want me to stay the same for you?
Chained to a lie, who's to blame? Let it die, we're the same

I can't believe you love me

I think I've been the devil
Since the day that I turned one
Like when I stole your money
Just to buy a pack of gum
I know it wasn't funny
Can't believe I was so dumb

I blame it on my age
But even now, I'm not so young
I'm still stuck in my ways
I can't believe what I've become
Somehow, you feel the same
I guess that's motherly love
Motherly love
Wish I could find the piece in me
To see the good things that you see
It's not that easy

[Chorus]
But if I saw me through your eyes
Maybe I could find a way
To forgive all of the lies
And the stupid things I say
And if I could realize
That it's your blood that I bleed
Maybe I could love myself
Like the way that you love me
If I saw me through your eyes
Your eyes
Through your eyes
Through my mother's eyes

[Verse 2]
I can't believe you love me
After all the things I did
Like when I said I hated you when we were in Madrid
Like when I didn't answer you cause I was on the road
But you cooked my favorite dinner for me right when I get home

[Pre-Chorus]
I blame it on my stress
Cause I've been feeling so high strung
I'm looking for excuses
And I know that isn't one
Somehow, you feel the same
I guess that's motherly love
Motherly love
Wish I could find the piece in me
To see the good things that you see
It's not that easy

But if I saw me through your eyes
Maybe I could find a way
To forgive all of the lies
And the stupid things I say
And if I could realize
That it's your blood that I bleed
Maybe I could love myself

To forgive all of the lies
And the stupid things I say

Uh, now, they lost it I found it, we leave 'em astounded
Asking me how you so fly, yet you still so grounded?
I replied, I died inside, resurrected a beast
Leave 'em deceased, music's in my genes like a crease
Got it, capisce? Hungry as hell trying to eat now
Success is the only thing that can complete us
Grinding to free us, the beat knocking like a fetus
Close your eyes, open up your ears so you can see this (Logic)

Said every day I take chances, Celine Dion, let's get it
I'm a diamond in the rough, but I shine like disco
Surrounded by greasy people like I doused them in Crisco
I haven't shined yet, so tell me where does the rest go?
Up a million percent until they finally hear this though
Bumping up in they city like, ""oh my God, this go""
My business getting better every year like fiscal
Fuck a pad and a pen, a mic my only utensil
I'm a original see but they trace like stencil
A stain in the game, but you fade like pencil
Biting off of my rhymes, that ain't even an insult
'Cause you couldn't produce, and in the end that shit's your fault
It takes 3 millions years for a diamond to shine
I did it in 21, see I'm ahead of my time
'Cause when I flow the crowd never roll 'cause I rock
On the road to success, haters in my blind spot
'Cause I got no time to bullshit

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

This emptiness won't let me live without you
This loneliness inside me, darlin'
Makes me feel half alive

49,Smoky Mountain Rain,"[Verse 1:]
I thumbed my way
From LA back to Knoxville
I found out those bright lights
Ain't where I belong

From a phone booth in the rain
I called to tell her
I've had a change of dreams
I'm coming home
But tears filled my eyes
When I found out she was gone

[Chorus:]
Smoky Mountain rain
Keeps on falling
I keep on calling her name

Smoky Mountain rain
I'll keep on searching
I can't go on hurting this way
She's somewhere in the Smokey Mountain rain

[Verse 2:]
I waved a diesel down outside a cafe
He said that he was going
As far as Gatlinburg
I climbed up in the cab
All wet and cold and lonely

I wiped my eyes
And told him about her
I've got to find her
Can you make these big wheels burn?

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
I can't blame her for letting go
A woman needs someone warm to hold
I feel the rain running down my face
I'll find her no matter what it takes

Tried to take control of the love
Love took control of me

Both a little bruised up but you know we managed
And that bond will never vanish
Used to hang out every day shit
We were so close your parent's took me on vacations
School was cool but it was never my thing
I was focused on ball trying better my game
At thirteen man I really thought I would play in the league
Fucked my whole winter up when I got cut from the team man
And I don't know about a god but I asked advice
A few years down the road is when I grabbed the mic
He told me grind 5 years as a sacrifice
Now the worlds mine mother fucker I'ma shine

No turning back now, I'm goin' all the way down

That's the chance I take
Knowing there's no such thing

And they're gettin' good and juiced
B.G.'s winin' dinin' checkin' talent at the club
Skippers hauntin' second lookin' forward to his rub
The busters from the country
And the hitters from the shop
Everybody wants to do the Horizontal Bop

Someone bring the records
Someone get the brew
Someone get a house
Buddy we'll know what to do
Someone tell the ladies
Someone make a deal
If we can't find a house
Then someone better find a field

Grass is good as carpet
Anyplace is fine
Its time to get to rockin'
Babe it's time to make it shine
Tell 'em we'll be dancin'
Dancin' till we drop
It's time to get down and do the Horizontal Bop

Theyre fillin' up the corners
Theyre fillin' up the streets
You can feel the tension
You can almost feel the heat
The music's gettin' louder
The beat's gittin' fast
Summers finally made it
Yeah its finally here at last

The pony cars are cruisin' on Woodward Avenue
Go and try to pass'em
They'll smoke you if you do

Oh, he doesn't need a tie clip

What can you get a Wookiee for Christmas

No, he'll never wear galoshes
Or a hat upon his furry dome
So what can you get a Wookiee for Christmas
When he already owns a comb?

Let's give him love and understanding
Good will to men
We wrap it all up in bright colored ribbon
And we give it to him all over again
And that's what you get a Wookiee for Christmas

And tomorrow I'll wake up and have to feel you fade away

Is this really what you want?

Let me go, cut the leash before
I lose us in a bad undertow
Have to channel how you made me feel
To play every show
Make my snide suggestions about
The things I don’t know
I will not catch a feeling I’ll just float
All that time across the pond
All this resin in my lungs
No more room to shoulder on
Am I even having fun?

Scott is looking for the one
Mertz is going by Ryan now that we’ve all had our run

Walking, flower of the world,

The color of dark honey
Where my heart burns and rests,

Your eyes are too big for the earth.

There are countries, there are rivers,
In your eyes,
My country is your eyes,
I walk through them,
They light the world

Your breasts are like two loaves made
Of grainy earth and golden moon,

Your waist,
My arm shaped it like a river when
It flowed a thousand years through your sweet body,

There is nothing like your hips,
Perhaps earth has
In some hidden place
The curve and the fragrance of your body,
Perhaps in some place,

When you sing or sleep,
When you suffer or dream,
Always,
When you are near or far,
Always,
You are mine, my lovely one,
Always.

79,Skateaway,"[Verse 1]
I seen a girl on a one-way corridor
Stealing down a wrong-way street
For all the world like an urban toreador
She had wheels on, on her feet
Well, the cars do the usual dances
Same old cruise and the kerbside crawl
But the rollergirl, she's taking chances
They just love to see her take them all

[Pre-Chorus]
No fears alone at night, she's sailing through the crowd
In her ears, the phones are tight, and the music's playing loud

[Verse 2]
Hallelujah, here she comes
Queen rollerball
Enchanté, what can I say?
Don't care at all
You know, she used to have to wait around
She used to be the lonely one
But now that she can skate around town
She's the only one

[Pre-Chorus]
No fears alone at night, she's sailing through the crowd
In her ears, the phones are tight, and the music's playing loud

[Chorus]
She gets rock and roll and a rock and roll station
And a rock and roll dream
She's making movies on location
She don't know what it means
But the music make her want to be the story
And the story was whatever was the song, what it was
Rollergirl, don't worry
D.J. play the movies all night long

[Verse 3]
She tortures taxi drivers just for fun
She like to read their lips
Says, ""Toro, toro, taxi, see you tomorrow, my son""
I swear she let a big truck grease her hip
She got her own world in the city
You can't intrude on her, no, no, no
She got her own world in the city
Because the city's been so rude to her

[Pre-Chorus]
No fears alone at night, she's sailing through the crowd
In her ears, the phones are tight, and the music's playing loud

[Chorus]
She gets rock and roll and a rock and roll station
And a rock and roll dream
She's making movies on location
She don't know what it means
But the music make her want to be the story
And the story was whatever was the song, what it was
Rollergirl, don't worry
D.J. play the movies all night long

[Outro]
Come slipping and sliding
Yeah, life's a roller ball
Slipping and a-sliding
Skateaway, that's all

Shala, shalay, hey hey, skateaway
Now shala, shalay, hey hey, skateaway

We've had a hard time
You and I
Life sent us through some changes
Oh, but somehow we got by
A winding road, a heavy load
Is nothing new, you see
We know that through the bad times
I'll have you and you'll have me

[Chorus]
United together
I finally found the one
Who'll love me forever
We two have just become as one

[Verse 2]
If we just keep this love alive
As time goes on this joy we know
Can't help but grow inside
Some people spend a lifetime
Looking for that special need
I'm so glad my search is over
Darling, I'm so glad that we're

There's nothing we can't overcome
If you let me be your only one
There's nothing we can't overcome
If you let me be your one and only, one and only
Some people spend a lifetime
Looking for that special need
I'm so glad my search is over

81,Merry Christmas In The NFL,"To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:Berkshire’s gain in net worth during 2015 was $15.4 billion, which increased the per-share book value of both our Class A and Class B stock by 6.4%. Over the last 51 years (that is, since present management took over), per-share book value has grown from $19 to $155,501, a rate of 19.2% compounded annually.*

During the first half of those years, Berkshire’s net worth was roughly equal to the number that really counts: the intrinsic value of the business. The similarity of the two figures existed then because most of our resources were deployed in marketable securities that were regularly revalued to their quoted prices (less the tax that would be incurred if they were to be sold). In Wall Street parlance, our balance sheet was then in very large part “marked to market.”

By the early 1990s, however, our focus had changed to the outright ownership of businesses, a shift that diminished the relevance of balance-sheet figures. That disconnect occurred because the accounting rules that apply to controlled companies are materially different from those used in valuing marketable securities. The carrying value of the “losers” we own is written down, but “winners” are never revalued upwards.

We’ve had experience with both outcomes: I’ve made some dumb purchases, and the amount I paid for the economic goodwill of those companies was later written off, a move that reduced Berkshire’s book value. We’ve also had some winners — a few of them very big — but have not written those up by a penny.

Over time, this asymmetrical accounting treatment (with which we agree) necessarily widens the gap between intrinsic value and book value. Today, the large — and growing — unrecorded gains at our “winners” make it clear that Berkshire’s intrinsic value far exceeds its book value. That’s why we would be delighted to repurchase our shares should they sell as low as 120% of book value. At that level, purchases would instantly and meaningfully increase per-share intrinsic value for Berkshire’s continuing shareholders.

The unrecorded increase in the value of our owned businesses explains why Berkshire’s aggregate market- value gain — tabulated on the facing page — materially exceeds our book-value gain. The two indicators vary erratically over short periods. Last year, for example, book-value performance was superior. Over time, however, market-value gains should continue their historical tendency to exceed gains in book value.

    * All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire’s A shares. Figures for the B shares are 1/1500th of those shown for A.
The Year at BerkshireCharlie Munger, Berkshire Vice Chairman and my partner, and I expect Berkshire’s normalized earning power to increase every year. (Actual year-to-year earnings, of course, will sometimes decline because of weakness in the U.S. economy or, possibly, because of insurance mega-catastrophes.) In some years the normalized gains will be small; at other times they will be material. Last year was a good one. Here are the highlights:
             The most important development at Berkshire during 2015 was not financial, though it led to better earnings. After a poor performance in 2014, our BNSF railroad dramatically improved its service to customers last year. To attain that result, we invested about $5.8 billion during the year in capital expenditures, a sum far and away the record for any American railroad and nearly three times our annual depreciation charge. It was money well spent.

BNSF moves about 17% of America’s intercity freight (measured by revenue ton-miles), whether transported by rail, truck, air, water or pipeline. In that respect, we are a strong number one among the seven large American railroads (two of which are Canadian-based), carrying 45% more ton-miles of freight than our closest competitor. Consequently, our maintaining first-class service is not only vital to our shippers’ welfare but also important to the smooth functioning of the U.S. economy.

For most American railroads, 2015 was a disappointing year. Aggregate ton-miles fell, and earnings weakened as well. BNSF, however, maintained volume, and pre-tax income rose to a record $6.8 billion* (a gain of $606 million from 2014). Matt Rose and Carl Ice, the managers of BNSF, have my thanks and deserve yours.

* Throughout this letter, all earnings are stated on a pre-tax basis unless otherwise designated.                       BNSF is the largest of our “Powerhouse Five,” a group that also includes Berkshire Hathaway Energy, Marmon, Lubrizol and IMC. Combined, these companies — our five most profitable non-insurance businesses — earned $13.1 billion in 2015, an increase of $650 million over 2014.

Of the five, only Berkshire Hathaway Energy, then earning $393 million, was owned by us in 2003. Subsequently, we purchased three of the other four on an all-cash basis. In acquiring BNSF, however, we paid about 70% of the cost in cash and, for the remainder, issued Berkshire shares that increased the number outstanding by 6.1%. In other words, the $12.7 billion gain in annual earnings delivered Berkshire by the five companies over the twelve-year span has been accompanied by only minor dilution. That satisfies our goal of not simply increasing earnings, but making sure we also increase per-share results.                       Next year, I will be discussing the “Powerhouse Six.” The newcomer will be Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”), a business that we purchased a month ago for more than $32 billion of cash. PCC fits perfectly into the Berkshire model and will substantially increase our normalized per-share earning power.

Under CEO Mark Donegan, PCC has become the world’s premier supplier of aerospace components (most of them destined to be original equipment, though spares are important to the company as well). Mark’s accomplishments remind me of the magic regularly performed by Jacob Harpaz at IMC, our remarkable Israeli manufacturer of cutting tools. The two men transform very ordinary raw materials into extraordinary products that are used by major manufacturers worldwide. Each is the da Vinci of his craft.

PCC’s products, often delivered under multi-year contracts, are key components in most large aircraft. Other industries are served as well by the company’s 30,466 employees, who work out of 162 plants in 13 countries. In building his business, Mark has made many acquisitions and will make more. We look forward to having him deploy Berkshire’s capital.

A personal thank-you: The PCC acquisition would not have happened without the input and assistance of our own Todd Combs, who brought the company to my attention a few years ago and went on to educate me about both the business and Mark. Though Todd and Ted Weschler are primarily investment managers — they each handle about $9 billion for us — both of them cheerfully and ably add major value to Berkshire in other ways as well. Hiring these two was one of my best moves.                       With the PCC acquisition, Berkshire will own 10 1⁄4 companies that would populate the Fortune 500 if they were stand-alone businesses. (Our 27% holding of Kraft Heinz is the 1⁄4.) That leaves just under 98% of America’s business giants that have yet to call us. Operators are standing by.                       Our many dozens of smaller non-insurance businesses earned $5.7 billion last year, up from $5.1 billion in 2014. Within this group, we have one company that last year earned more than $700 million, two that earned between $400 million and $700 million, seven that earned between $250 million and $400 million, six that earned between $100 million and $250 million, and eleven that earned between $50 million and $100 million. We love them all: This collection of businesses will expand both in number and earnings as the years go by.                       When you hear talk about America’s crumbling infrastructure, rest assured that they’re not talking about Berkshire. We invested $16 billion in property, plant and equipment last year, a full 86% of it deployed in the United States.

I told you earlier about BNSF’s record capital expenditures in 2015. At the end of every year, our railroad’s physical facilities will be improved from those existing twelve months earlier.

Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) is a similar story. That company has invested $16 billion in renewables and now owns 7% of the country’s wind generation and 6% of its solar generation. Indeed, the 4,423 megawatts of wind generation owned and operated by our regulated utilities is six times the generation of the runner-up utility.

We’re not done. Last year, BHE made major commitments to the future development of renewables in support of the Paris Climate Change Conference. Our fulfilling those promises will make great sense, both for the environment and for Berkshire’s economics.                       Berkshire’s huge and growing insurance operation again operated at an underwriting profit in 2015 — that makes 13 years in a row — and increased its float. During those years, our float — money that doesn’t belong to us but that we can invest for Berkshire’s benefit — grew from $41 billion to $88 billion. Though neither that gain nor the size of our float is reflected in Berkshire’s earnings, float generates significant investment income because of the assets it allows us to hold.

Meanwhile, our underwriting profit totaled $26 billion during the 13-year period, including $1.8 billion earned in 2015. Without a doubt, Berkshire’s largest unrecorded wealth lies in its insurance business. We’ve spent 48 years building this multi-faceted operation, and it can’t be replicated.                       While Charlie and I search for new businesses to buy, our many subsidiaries are regularly making bolt-on acquisitions. Last year we contracted for 29 bolt-ons, scheduled to cost $634 million in aggregate. The cost of these purchases ranged from $300,000 to $143 million.

Charlie and I encourage bolt-ons, if they are sensibly-priced. (Most deals offered us most definitely aren’t.) These purchases deploy capital in operations that fit with our existing businesses and that will be managed by our corps of expert managers. That means no additional work for us, yet more earnings for Berkshire, a combination we find highly appealing. We will make many dozens of bolt-on deals in future years.                       Our Heinz partnership with Jorge Paulo Lemann, Alex Behring and Bernardo Hees more than doubled its size last year by merging with Kraft. Before this transaction, we owned about 53% of Heinz at a cost of
$4.25 billion. Now we own 325.4 million shares of Kraft Heinz (about 27%) that cost us $9.8 billion. The new company has annual sales of $27 billion and can supply you Heinz ketchup or mustard to go with your Oscar Mayer hot dogs that come from the Kraft side. Add a Coke, and you will be enjoying my favorite meal. (We will have the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile at the annual meeting — bring your kids.)

Though we sold no Kraft Heinz shares, “GAAP” (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) required us to record a $6.8 billion write-up of our investment upon completion of the merger. That leaves us with our Kraft Heinz holding carried on our balance sheet at a value many billions above our cost and many billions below its market value, an outcome only an accountant could love.

Berkshire also owns Kraft Heinz preferred shares that pay us $720 million annually and are carried at $7.7 billion on our balance sheet. That holding will almost certainly be redeemed for $8.32 billion in June (the earliest date allowed under the preferred’s terms). That will be good news for Kraft Heinz and bad news for Berkshire.

Jorge Paulo and his associates could not be better partners. We share with them a passion to buy, build and hold large businesses that satisfy basic needs and desires. We follow different paths, however, in pursuing this goal.

Their method, at which they have been extraordinarily successful, is to buy companies that offer an opportunity for eliminating many unnecessary costs and then — very promptly — to make the moves that will get the job done. Their actions significantly boost productivity, the all-important factor in America’s economic growth over the past 240 years. Without more output of desired goods and services per working hour — that’s the measure of productivity gains — an economy inevitably stagnates. At much of corporate America, truly major gains in productivity are possible, a fact offering opportunities to Jorge Paulo and his associates.

At Berkshire, we, too, crave efficiency and detest bureaucracy. To achieve our goals, however, we follow an approach emphasizing avoidance of bloat, buying businesses such as PCC that have long been run by cost-conscious and efficient managers. After the purchase, our role is simply to create an environment in which these CEOs — and their eventual successors, who typically are like-minded — can maximize both their managerial effectiveness and the pleasure they derive from their jobs. (With this hands-off style, I am heeding a well-known Mungerism: “If you want to guarantee yourself a lifetime of misery, be sure to marry someone with the intent of changing their behavior.”)

We will continue to operate with extreme — indeed, almost unheard of — decentralization at Berkshire. But we will also look for opportunities to partner with Jorge Paulo, either as a financing partner, as was the case when his group purchased Tim Horton’s, or as a combined equity-and-financing partner, as at Heinz. We also may occasionally partner with others, as we have successfully done at Berkadia.

Berkshire, however, will join only with partners making friendly acquisitions. To be sure, certain hostile offers are justified: Some CEOs forget that it is shareholders for whom they should be working, while other managers are woefully inept. In either case, directors may be blind to the problem or simply reluctant to make the change required. That’s when new faces are needed. We, though, will leave these “opportunities” for others. At Berkshire, we go only where we are welcome.                       Berkshire increased its ownership interest last year in each of its “Big Four” investments — American Express, Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo. We purchased additional shares of IBM (increasing our ownership to 8.4% versus 7.8% at yearend 2014) and Wells Fargo (going to 9.8% from 9.4%). At the other two companies, Coca-Cola and American Express, stock repurchases raised our percentage ownership. Our equity in Coca-Cola grew from 9.2% to 9.3%, and our interest in American Express increased from 14.8% to 15.6%. In case you think these seemingly small changes aren’t important, consider this math: For the four companies in aggregate, each increase of one percentage point in our ownership raises Berkshire’s portion of their annual earnings by about $500 million.

These four investees possess excellent businesses and are run by managers who are both talented and shareholder-oriented. Their returns on tangible equity range from excellent to staggering. At Berkshire, we much prefer owning a non-controlling but substantial portion of a wonderful company to owning 100% of a so-so business. It’s better to have a partial interest in the Hope Diamond than to own all of a rhinestone.

If Berkshire’s yearend holdings are used as the marker, our portion of the “Big Four’s” 2015 earnings amounted to $4.7 billion. In the earnings we report to you, however, we include only the dividends they pay us — about $1.8 billion last year. But make no mistake: The nearly $3 billion of these companies’ earnings we don’t report are every bit as valuable to us as the portion Berkshire records.

The earnings our investees retain are often used for repurchases of their own stock — a move that increases Berkshire’s share of future earnings without requiring us to lay out a dime. The retained earnings of these companies also fund business opportunities that usually turn out to be advantageous. All that leads us to expect that the per-share earnings of these four investees, in aggregate, will grow substantially over time. If gains do indeed materialize, dividends to Berkshire will increase and so, too, will our unrealized capital gains.

Our flexibility in capital allocation — our willingness to invest large sums passively in non-controlled businesses — gives us a significant edge over companies that limit themselves to acquisitions they will operate. Woody Allen once explained that the advantage of being bi-sexual is that it doubles your chance of finding a date on Saturday night. In like manner — well, not exactly like manner — our appetite for either operating businesses or passive investments doubles our chances of finding sensible uses for Berkshire’s endless gusher of cash. Beyond that, having a huge portfolio of marketable securities gives us a stockpile of funds that can be tapped when an elephant-sized acquisition is offered to us.       * * * * * * * * * * * *

It’s an election year, and candidates can’t stop speaking about our country’s problems (which, of course, only they can solve). As a result of this negative drumbeat, many Americans now believe that their children will not live as well as they themselves do.

That view is dead wrong: The babies being born in America today are the luckiest crop in history.

American GDP per capita is now about $56,000. As I mentioned last year that — in real terms — is a staggering six times the amount in 1930, the year I was born, a leap far beyond the wildest dreams of my parents or their contemporaries. U.S. citizens are not intrinsically more intelligent today, nor do they work harder than did Americans in 1930. Rather, they work far more efficiently and thereby produce far more. This all-powerful trend is certain to continue: America’s economic magic remains alive and well.

Some commentators bemoan our current 2% per year growth in real GDP — and, yes, we would all like to see a higher rate. But let’s do some simple math using the much-lamented 2% figure. That rate, we will see, delivers astounding gains.
America’s population is growing about .8% per year (.5% from births minus deaths and .3% from net migration). Thus 2% of overall growth produces about 1.2% of per capita growth. That may not sound impressive. But in a single generation of, say, 25 years, that rate of growth leads to a gain of 34.4% in real GDP per capita. (Compounding’s effects produce the excess over the percentage that would result by simply multiplying 25 x 1.2%.) In turn, that 34.4% gain will produce a staggering $19,000 increase in real GDP per capita for the next generation. Were that to be distributed equally, the gain would be $76,000 annually for a family of four. Today’s politicians need not shed tears for tomorrow’s children.

Indeed, most of today’s children are doing well. All families in my upper middle-class neighborhood regularly enjoy a living standard better than that achieved by John D. Rockefeller Sr. at the time of my birth. His unparalleled fortune couldn’t buy what we now take for granted, whether the field is — to name just a few — transportation, entertainment, communication or medical services. Rockefeller certainly had power and fame; he could not, however, live as well as my neighbors now do.

Though the pie to be shared by the next generation will be far larger than today’s, how it will be divided will remain fiercely contentious. Just as is now the case, there will be struggles for the increased output of goods and services between those people in their productive years and retirees, between the healthy and the infirm, between the inheritors and the Horatio Algers, between investors and workers and, in particular, between those with talents that are valued highly by the marketplace and the equally decent hard-working Americans who lack the skills the market prizes. Clashes of that sort have forever been with us — and will forever continue. Congress will be the battlefield; money and votes will be the weapons. Lobbying will remain a growth industry.

The good news, however, is that even members of the “losing” sides will almost certainly enjoy — as they should — far more goods and services in the future than they have in the past. The quality of their increased bounty will also dramatically improve. Nothing rivals the market system in producing what people want — nor, even more so, in delivering what people don’t yet know they want. My parents, when young, could not envision a television set, nor did I, in my 50s, think I needed a personal computer. Both products, once people saw what they could do, quickly revolutionized their lives. I now spend ten hours a week playing bridge online. And, as I write this letter, “search” is invaluable to me. (I’m not ready for Tinder, however.)

For 240 years it’s been a terrible mistake to bet against America, and now is no time to start. America’s golden goose of commerce and innovation will continue to lay more and larger eggs. America’s social security promises will be honored and perhaps made more generous. And, yes, America’s kids will live far better than their parents did.

* * * * * * * * * * * *

Considering this favorable tailwind, Berkshire (and, to be sure, a great many other businesses) will almost certainly prosper. The managers who succeed Charlie and me will build Berkshire’s per-share intrinsic value by following our simple blueprint of: (1) constantly improving the basic earning power of our many subsidiaries; (2) further increasing their earnings through bolt-on acquisitions; (3) benefiting from the growth of our investees; (4) repurchasing Berkshire shares when they are available at a meaningful discount from intrinsic value; and (5) making an occasional large acquisition. Management will also try to maximize results for you by rarely, if ever, issuing Berkshire shares.
Intrinsic Business ValueAs much as Charlie and I talk about intrinsic business value, we cannot tell you precisely what that number is for Berkshire shares (nor, in fact, for any other stock). It is possible, however, to make a sensible estimate. In our 2010 annual report we laid out the three elements — one of them qualitative — that we believe are the keys to an estimation of Berkshire’s intrinsic value. That discussion is reproduced in full on pages 113-114.

Here is an update of the two quantitative factors: In 2015 our per-share cash and investments increased 8.3% to $159,794 (with our Kraft Heinz shares stated at market value), and earnings from our many businesses — including insurance underwriting income — increased 2.1% to $12,304 per share. We exclude in the second factor the dividends and interest from the investments we hold because including them would produce a double-counting of value. In arriving at our earnings figure, we deduct all corporate overhead, interest, depreciation, amortization and minority interests. Income taxes, though, are not deducted. That is, the earnings are pre-tax.

I used the italics in the paragraph above because we are for the first time including insurance underwriting income in business earnings. We did not do that when we initially introduced Berkshire’s two quantitative pillars of valuation because our insurance results were then heavily influenced by catastrophe coverages. If the wind didn’t blow and the earth didn’t shake, we made large profits. But a mega-catastrophe would produce red ink. In order to be conservative then in stating our business earnings, we consistently assumed that underwriting would break even over time and ignored any of its gains or losses in our annual calculation of the second factor of value.

Today, our insurance results are likely to be more stable than was the case a decade or two ago because we have deemphasized catastrophe coverages and greatly expanded our bread-and-butter lines of business. Last year, our underwriting income contributed $1,118 per share to the $12,304 per share of earnings referenced in the second paragraph of this section. Over the past decade, annual underwriting income has averaged $1,434 per share, and we anticipate being profitable in most years. You should recognize, however, that underwriting in any given year could well be unprofitable, perhaps substantially so.

Since 1970, our per-share investments have increased at a rate of 18.9% compounded annually, and our earnings (including the underwriting results in both the initial and terminal year) have grown at a 23.7% clip. It is no coincidence that the price of Berkshire stock over the ensuing 45 years has increased at a rate very similar to that of our two measures of value. Charlie and I like to see gains in both sectors, but our main goal is to build operating earnings.

* * * * * * * * * * * *

Now, let’s examine the four major sectors of our operations. Each has vastly different balance sheet and income characteristics from the others. So we’ll present them as four separate businesses, which is how Charlie and I view them (though there are important and enduring economic advantages to having them all under one roof). Our intent is to provide you with the information we would wish to have if our positions were reversed, with you being the reporting manager and we the absentee shareholders. (Don’t get excited; this is not a switch we are considering.)
InsuranceLet’s look first at insurance. The property-casualty (“P/C”) branch of that industry has been the engine that has propelled our expansion since 1967, when we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, National Fire & Marine, for $8.6 million. Today, National Indemnity is the largest property-casualty company in the world, as measured by net worth. Moreover, its intrinsic value is far in excess of the value at which it is carried on our books.

One reason we were attracted to the P/C business was its financial characteristics: P/C insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as those arising from certain workers’ compensation accidents, payments can stretch over many decades. This collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companies holding large sums — money we call “float” — that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest this float for their own benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount of float an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And how we have grown, as the following table shows:

TABLE

Further gains in float will be tough to achieve. On the plus side, GEICO and several of our specialized operations are almost certain to grow at a good clip. National Indemnity’s reinsurance division, however, is party to a number of run-off contracts whose float drifts downward. If we do in time experience a decline in float, it will be very gradual — at the outside no more than 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can never be subject to immediate or near-term demands for sums that are of significance to our cash resources. This structure is by design and is a key component in the strength of Berkshire’s economic fortress. It will never be compromised.

If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit that adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the use of free money — and, better yet, get paid for holding it.

Unfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so vigorous indeed that it sometimes causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. This loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that the insurance industry, despite the float income all its companies enjoy, will continue its dismal record of earning subnormal returns on tangible net worth as compared to other American businesses. The prolonged period of low interest rates the world is now dealing with also virtually guarantees that earnings on float will steadily decrease for many years to come, thereby exacerbating the profit problems of insurers. It’s a good bet that industry results over the next ten years will fall short of those recorded in the past decade, particularly for those companies that specialize in reinsurance.

As noted early in this report, Berkshire has now operated at an underwriting profit for 13 consecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $26.2 billion. That’s no accident: Disciplined risk evaluation is the daily focus of all of our insurance managers, who know that while float is valuable, its benefits can be drowned by poor underwriting results. All insurers give that message lip service. At Berkshire it is a religion, Old Testament style.

So how does our float affect intrinsic value? When Berkshire’s book value is calculated, the full amount of our float is deducted as a liability, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and could not replenish it. But to think of float as strictly a liability is incorrect. It should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Daily, we pay old claims and related expenses — a huge $24.5 billion to more than six million claimants in 2015 — and that reduces float. Just as surely, we each day write new business that will soon generate its own claims, adding to float.
If our revolving float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe it will be, the true value of this liability is dramatically less than the accounting liability. Owing $1 that in effect will never leave the premises — because new business is almost certain to deliver a substitute — is worlds different from owing $1 that will go out the door tomorrow and not be replaced. The two types of liabilities, however, are treated as equals under GAAP.

A partial offset to this overstated liability is a $15.5 billion “goodwill” asset that we incurred in buying our insurance companies and that increases book value. In very large part, this goodwill represents the price we paid for the float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has no bearing on its true value. For example, if an insurance company sustains large and prolonged underwriting losses, any goodwill asset carried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost.

Fortunately, that does not describe Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of  our insurance goodwill — what we would happily pay for float of similar quality were we to purchase an insurance operation possessing it — to be far in excess of its historic carrying value. Indeed, almost the entire $15.5 billion we carry for goodwill in our insurance business was already on our books in 2000. Yet we subsequently tripled our float. Its value today is one reason — a huge reason — why we believe Berkshire’s intrinsic business value substantially exceeds its book value.

* * * * * * * * * * * *

Berkshire’s attractive insurance economics exist only because we have some terrific managers running disciplined operations that possess hard-to-replicate business models. Let me tell you about the major units.

First by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, managed by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risks that no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and, most important, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks that are inappropriate in relation to our resources.

Indeed, Berkshire is far more conservative in avoiding risk than most large insurers. For example, if the insurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some mega-catastrophe — a loss about triple anything it has ever experienced — Berkshire as a whole would likely record a significant profit for the year because of its many streams of earnings. We would also remain awash in cash and be looking for large opportunities to write business in an insurance market that might well be in disarray. Meanwhile, other major insurers and reinsurers would be swimming in red ink, if not facing insolvency.

When Ajit entered Berkshire’s office on a Saturday in 1986, he did not have a day’s experience in the insurance business. Nevertheless, Mike Goldberg, then our manager of insurance, handed him the keys to our reinsurance business. With that move, Mike achieved sainthood: Since then, Ajit has created tens of billions of value for Berkshire shareholders.

We have another reinsurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross.

At bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all exposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively assess the likelihood of any exposure actually causing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profit after both prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the appropriate premium can’t be obtained.
Many insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. They simply can’t turn their back on business that is being eagerly written by their competitors. That old line, “The other guy is doing it, so we must as well,” spells trouble in any business, but in none more so than insurance.

Tad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re’s huge float has been considerably better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, to continue. We are particularly enthusiastic about General Re’s international life reinsurance business, which has grown consistently and profitably since we acquired the company in 1998.

It can be remembered that soon after we purchased General Re, it was beset by problems that caused commentators — and me as well, briefly — to believe I had made a huge mistake. That day is long gone. General Re is now a gem.

* * * * * * * * * * * *

Finally, there is GEICO, the insurer on which I cut my teeth 65 years ago. GEICO is managed by Tony Nicely, who joined the company at 18 and completed 54 years of service in 2015. Tony became CEO in 1993, and since then the company has been flying. There is no better manager than Tony. In the 40 years that I’ve known him, his every action has made great sense.

When I was first introduced to GEICO in January 1951, I was blown away by the huge cost advantage the company enjoyed compared to the expenses borne by the giants of the industry. It was clear to me that GEICO would succeed because it deserved to succeed.

No one likes to buy auto insurance. Almost everyone, though, likes to drive. The insurance consequently needed is a major expenditure for most families. Savings matter to them — and only a low-cost operation can deliver these. Indeed, at least 40% of the people reading this letter can save money by insuring with GEICO. So stop reading — right now! — and go to geico.com or call 800-368-2734.

GEICO’s cost advantage is the factor that has enabled the company to gobble up market share year after year. (We ended 2015 with 11.4% of the market compared to 2.5% in 1995, when Berkshire acquired control of GEICO.) The company’s low costs create a moat — an enduring one — that competitors are unable to cross.

All the while, our gecko never tires of telling Americans how GEICO can save them important money. I love hearing the little guy deliver his message: “15 minutes could save you 15% or more on car insurance.” (Of course, there’s always a grouch in the crowd. One of my friends says he is glad that only a few animals can talk, since the ones that do speak seem unable to discuss any subject but insurance.)

* * * * * * * * * * * *

In addition to our three major insurance operations, we own a group of smaller companies that primarily write commercial coverages. In aggregate, these companies are a large, growing and valuable operation that consistently delivers an underwriting profit, usually much better than that reported by their competitors. Indeed, over the past 13 years, this group has earned $4 billion from underwriting — about 13% of its premium volume — while increasing its float from $943 million to $9.9 billion.

Less than three years ago, we formed Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BHSI”), which we include in this group. Our first decision was to put Peter Eastwood in charge. That move was a home run: BHSI has already developed $1 billion of annual premium volume and, under Peter’s direction, is destined to become one of the world’s leading P/C insurers.
Here’s a recap of underwriting earnings and float by division:

TABLE

Berkshire’s great managers, premier financial strength and a variety of business models protected by wide moats amount to something unique in the insurance world. This assemblage of strengths is a huge asset for Berkshire shareholders that will only get more valuable with time.
Regulated, Capital-Intensive BusinessesWe have two major operations, BNSF and BHE, that share important characteristics distinguishing them from our other businesses. Consequently, we assign them their own section in this letter and split out their combined financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and income statement. Together, they last year accounted for 37% of Berkshire’s after-tax operating earnings.

A key characteristic of both companies is their huge investment in very long-lived, regulated assets, with these partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is not guaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is in fact not needed because each company has earning power that even under terrible economic conditions would far exceed its interest requirements. Last year, for example, in a disappointing year for railroads, BNSF’s interest coverage was more than 8:1. (Our definition of coverage is the ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest, not EBITDA/ interest, a commonly used measure we view as seriously flawed.)

At BHE, meanwhile, two factors ensure the company’s ability to service its debt under all circumstances. The first is common to all utilities: recession-resistant earnings, which result from these companies offering an essential service on an exclusive basis. The second is enjoyed by few other utilities: a great and ever-widening diversity of earnings streams, which shield BHE from being seriously harmed by any single regulatory body. These many sources of profit, supplemented by the inherent advantage of being owned by a strong parent, have allowed BHE and its utility subsidiaries to significantly lower their cost of debt. This economic fact benefits both us and our customers.

All told, BHE and BNSF invested $11.6 billion in plant and equipment last year, a massive commitment to key components of America’s infrastructure. We relish making such investments as long as they promise reasonable returns — and, on that front, we put a large amount of trust in future regulation.

Our confidence is justified both by our past experience and by the knowledge that society will forever need huge investments in both transportation and energy. It is in the self-interest of governments to treat capital providers in a manner that will ensure the continued flow of funds to essential projects. It is concomitantly in our self-interest to conduct our operations in a way that earns the approval of our regulators and the people they represent.

Low prices are a powerful way to keep these constituencies happy. In Iowa, BHE’s average retail rate is 6.8¢ per KWH. Alliant, the other major electric utility in the state, averages 9.5¢. Here are the comparable industry figures for adjacent states: Nebraska 9.0¢, Missouri 9.3¢, Illinois 9.3¢, Minnesota 9.7¢. The national average is 10.4¢. Our rock-bottom prices add up to real money for paycheck-strapped customers.
At BNSF, price comparisons between major railroads are far more difficult to make because of significant differences in both their mix of cargo and the average distance it is carried. To supply a very crude measure, however, our revenue per ton-mile was just under 3¢ last year, while shipping costs for customers of the other four major U.S.-based railroads were at least 40% higher, ranging from 4.2¢ to 5.3¢.

Both BHE and BNSF have been leaders in pursuing planet-friendly technology. In wind generation, no state comes close to Iowa, where last year megawatt-hours we generated from wind equaled 47% of all megawatt-hours sold to our retail customers. (Additional wind projects to which we are committed will take that figure to 58% in 2017.)

BNSF, like other Class I railroads, uses only a single gallon of diesel fuel to move a ton of freight almost 500 miles. That makes the railroads four times as fuel-efficient as trucks! Furthermore, railroads alleviate highway congestion — and the taxpayer-funded maintenance expenditures that come with heavier traffic — in a major way.

Here are the key figures for BHE and BNSF:

TABLE

I currently expect increased after-tax earnings at BHE in 2016, but lower earnings at BNSF.
Manufacturing, Service and Retailing OperationsOur activities in this part of Berkshire cover the waterfront. Let’s look, though, at a summary balance sheet and earnings statement for the entire group.

TABLE

* Earnings for 2013 have been restated to exclude Marmon’s leasing operations, which are now included in the Finance and Financial Products results.

Our income and expense data conforming to GAAP is on page 38. In contrast, the operating expense figures above are non-GAAP because they exclude some purchase-accounting items (primarily the amortization of certain intangible assets). We present the data in this manner because Charlie and I believe the adjusted numbers more accurately reflect the true economic expenses and profits of the businesses aggregated in the table than do GAAP figures.

I won’t explain all of the adjustments — some are tiny and arcane — but serious investors should understand the disparate nature of intangible assets. Some truly deplete in value over time, while others in no way lose value. For software, as a big example, amortization charges are very real expenses. Conversely, the concept of recording charges against other intangibles, such as customer relationships, arises from purchase-accounting rules and clearly does not reflect economic reality. GAAP accounting draws no distinction between the two types of charges. Both, that is, are recorded as expenses when earnings are calculated — even though, from an investor’s viewpoint, they could not differ more.
In the GAAP-compliant figures we show on page 38, amortization charges of $1.1 billion have been deducted as expenses. We would call about 20% of these “real,” the rest not. The “non-real” charges, once non- existent at Berkshire, have become significant because of the many acquisitions we have made. Non-real amortization charges are likely to climb further as we acquire more companies.

The table on page 55 gives you the current status of our intangible assets as calculated by GAAP. We now have $6.8 billion left of amortizable intangibles, of which $4.1 billion will be expensed over the next five years. Eventually, of course, every dollar of these “assets” will be charged off. When that happens, reported earnings increase even if true earnings are flat. (My gift to my successor.)

I suggest that you ignore a portion of GAAP amortization costs. But it is with some trepidation that I do that, knowing that it has become common for managers to tell their owners to ignore certain expense items that are all too real. “Stock-based compensation” is the most egregious example. The very name says it all: “compensation.” If compensation isn’t an expense, what is it? And, if real and recurring expenses don’t belong in the calculation of earnings, where in the world do they belong?

Wall Street analysts often play their part in this charade, too, parroting the phony, compensation-ignoring “earnings” figures fed them by managements. Maybe the offending analysts don’t know any better. Or maybe they fear losing “access” to management. Or maybe they are cynical, telling themselves that since everyone else is playing the game, why shouldn’t they go along with it. Whatever their reasoning, these analysts are guilty of propagating misleading numbers that can deceive investors.

Depreciation charges are a more complicated subject but are almost always true costs. Certainly they are at Berkshire. I wish we could keep our businesses competitive while spending less than our depreciation charge, but in 51 years I’ve yet to figure out how to do so. Indeed, the depreciation charge we record in our railroad business falls far short of the capital outlays needed to merely keep the railroad running properly, a mismatch that leads to GAAP earnings that are higher than true economic earnings. (This overstatement of earnings exists at all railroads.) When CEOs or investment bankers tout pre-depreciation figures such as EBITDA as a valuation guide, watch their noses lengthen while they speak.

Our public reports of earnings will, of course, continue to conform to GAAP. To embrace reality, however, you should remember to add back most of the amortization charges we report. You should also subtract something to reflect BNSF’s inadequate depreciation charge.

* * * * * * * * * * * *

Let’s get back to our many manufacturing, service and retailing operations, which sell products ranging from lollipops to jet airplanes. Some of this sector’s businesses, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangible assets, enjoy terrific economics, producing profits that run from 25% after-tax to far more than 100%. Others generate good returns in the area of 12% to 20%.

A few, however — these are serious mistakes I made in my job of capital allocation — have very poor returns. In most of these cases, I was wrong in my evaluation of the economic dynamics of the company or the industry in which it operates, and we are now paying the price for my misjudgments. At other times, I stumbled in evaluating either the fidelity or the ability of incumbent managers or ones I later appointed. I will commit more errors; you can count on that. If we luck out, they will occur at our smaller operations.

Viewed as a single entity, the companies in this group are an excellent business. They employed an average of $25.6 billion of net tangible assets during 2015 and, despite their holding large quantities of excess cash and using only token amounts of leverage, earned 18.4% after-tax on that capital.
Of course, a business with terrific economics can be a bad investment if it is bought at too high a price. We have paid substantial premiums to net tangible assets for most of our businesses, a cost that is reflected in the large figure we show for goodwill and other intangibles. Overall, however, we are getting a decent return on the capital we have deployed in this sector. Earnings from the group should grow substantially in 2016 as Duracell and Precision Castparts enter the fold.

* * * * * * * * * * * *

We have far too many companies in this group to comment on them individually. Moreover, their competitors — both current and potential — read this report. In a few of our businesses we might be disadvantaged if others knew our numbers. In some of our operations that are not of a size material to an evaluation of Berkshire, therefore, we only disclose what is required. You can nevertheless find a good bit of detail about many of our operations on pages 88-91.
Finance and Financial ProductsOur three leasing and rental operations are conducted by CORT (furniture), XTRA (semi-trailers), and Marmon (primarily tank cars but also freight cars, intermodal tank containers and cranes). These companies are industry leaders and have substantially increased their earnings as the American economy has gained strength. At each of the three, we have invested more money in new equipment than have many of our competitors, and that’s paid off. Dealing from strength is one of Berkshire’s enduring advantages.

Kevin Clayton has again delivered an industry-leading performance at Clayton Homes, the second-largest home builder in America. Last year, the company sold 34,397 homes, about 45% of the manufactured homes bought by Americans. In contrast, the company was number three in the field, with a 14% share, when Berkshire purchased it in 2003.

Manufactured homes allow the American dream of home ownership to be achieved by lower-income citizens: Around 70% of new homes costing $150,000 or less come from our industry. About 46% of Clayton’s homes are sold through the 331 stores we ourselves own and operate. Most of Clayton’s remaining sales are made to 1,395 independent retailers.

Key to Clayton’s operation is its $12.8 billion mortgage portfolio. We originate about 35% of all mortgages on manufactured homes. About 37% of our mortgage portfolio emanates from our retail operation, with the balance primarily originated by independent retailers, some of which sell our homes while others market only the homes of our competitors.

Lenders other than Clayton have come and gone. With Berkshire’s backing, however, Clayton steadfastly financed home buyers throughout the panic days of 2008-2009. Indeed, during that period, Clayton used precious capital to finance dealers who did not sell our homes. The funds we supplied to Goldman Sachs and General Electric at that time produced headlines; the funds Berkshire quietly delivered to Clayton both made home ownership possible for thousands of families and kept many non-Clayton dealers alive.

Our retail outlets, employing simple language and large type, consistently inform home buyers of alternative sources for financing — most of it coming from local banks — and always secure acknowledgments from customers that this information has been received and read. (The form we use is reproduced in its actual size on page 119.)
Mortgage-origination practices are of great importance to both the borrower and to society. There is no question that reckless practices in home lending played a major role in bringing on the financial panic of 2008, which in turn led to the Great Recession. In the years preceding the meltdown, a destructive and often corrupt pattern  of  mortgage  creation  flourished  whereby  (1)  an  originator  in,  say,  California  would  make  loans  and (2) promptly sell them to an investment or commercial bank in, say, New York, which would package many mortgages to serve as collateral for a dizzyingly complicated array of mortgage-backed securities to be (3) sold to unwitting institutions around the world.

As if these sins weren’t sufficient to create an unholy mess, imaginative investment bankers sometimes concocted a second layer of sliced-up financing whose value depended on the junkier portions of primary offerings. (When Wall Street gets “innovative,” watch out!) While that was going on, I described this “doubling-up” practice as requiring an investor to read tens of thousands of pages of mind-numbing prose to evaluate a single security being offered.

Both the originator and the packager of these financings had no skin in the game and were driven by volume and mark-ups. Many housing borrowers joined the party as well, blatantly lying on their loan applications while mortgage originators looked the other way. Naturally, the gamiest credits generated the most profits. Smooth Wall Street salesmen garnered millions annually by manufacturing products that their customers were unable to understand. (It’s also questionable as to whether the major rating agencies were capable of evaluating the more complex structures. But rate them they did.)

Barney Frank, perhaps the most financially-savvy member of Congress during the panic, recently assessed the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, saying, “The one major weakness that I’ve seen in the implementation was this decision by the regulators not to impose risk retention on all residential mortgages.” Today, some legislators and commentators continue to advocate a 1%-to-5% retention by the originator as a way to align its interests with that of the ultimate lender or mortgage guarantor.

At Clayton, our risk retention was, and is, 100%. When we originate a mortgage we keep it (leaving aside the few that qualify for a government guarantee). When we make mistakes in granting credit, we therefore pay a price — a hefty price that dwarfs any profit we realized upon the original sale of the home. Last year we had to foreclose on 8,444 manufactured-housing mortgages at a cost to us of $157 million.

The average loan we made in 2015 was only $59,942, small potatoes for traditional mortgage lenders, but a daunting commitment for our many lower-income borrowers. Our buyer acquires a decent home — take a look at the home we will have on display at our annual meeting — requiring monthly principal-and-interest payments that average $522.

Some borrowers, of course, will lose their jobs, and there will be divorces and deaths. Others will get over- extended on credit cards and mishandle their finances. We will lose money then, and our borrower will lose his down payment (though his mortgage payments during his time of occupancy may have been well under rental rates for comparable quarters). Nevertheless, despite the low FICO scores and income of our borrowers, their payment behavior during the Great Recession was far better than that prevailing in many mortgage pools populated by people earning multiples of our typical borrower’s income.

The strong desire of our borrowers to have a home of their own is one reason we’ve done well with our mortgage portfolio. Equally important, we have financed much of the portfolio with floating-rate debt or with short- term fixed-rate debt. Consequently, the incredibly low short-term rates of recent years have provided us a constantly-widening spread between our interest costs and the income we derive from our mortgage portfolio, which bears fixed rates. (Incidentally, we would have enjoyed similar margins had we simply bought long-term bonds and financed the position in some short-term manner.)
Normally, it is risky business to lend long at fixed rates and borrow short as we have been doing at Clayton. Over the years, some important financial institutions have gone broke doing that. At Berkshire, however, we possess a natural offset in that our businesses always maintain at least $20 billion in cash-equivalents that earn short-term rates. More often, our short-term investments are in the $40 billion to $60 billion range. If we have, say, $60 billion invested at ¼% or less, a sharp move to higher short-term rates would bring benefits to us far exceeding the higher financing costs we would incur in funding Clayton’s $13 billion mortgage portfolio. In banking terms, Berkshire is — and always will be — heavily asset-sensitive and will consequently benefit from rising interest rates.

Let me talk about one subject of which I am particularly proud, that having to do with regulation. The Great Recession caused mortgage originators, servicers and packagers to come under intense scrutiny and to be assessed many billions of dollars in fines and penalties.

The scrutiny has certainly extended to Clayton, whose mortgage practices have been continuously reviewed and examined in respect to such items as originations, servicing, collections, advertising, compliance, and internal controls. At the federal level, we answer to the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Dozens of states regulate us as well. During the past two years, indeed, various federal and state authorities (from 25 states) examined and reviewed Clayton and its mortgages on 65 occasions. The result? Our total fines during this period were $38,200 and our refunds to customers $704,678. Furthermore, though we had to foreclose on 2.64% of our manufactured-home mortgages last year, 95.4% of our borrowers were current on their payments at yearend, as they moved toward owning a debt-free home.

* * * * * * * * * * * *

Marmon’s rail fleet expanded to 133,220 units by yearend, a number significantly increased by the company’s purchase of 25,085 cars from General Electric on September 30. If our fleet was connected to form a single train, the engine would be in Omaha and the caboose in Portland, Maine.

At yearend, 97% of our railcars were leased, with about 15-17% of the fleet coming up for renewal each year. Though “tank cars” sound like vessels carrying crude oil, only about 7% of our fleet carries that product; chemicals and refined petroleum products are the lead items we transport. When trains roll by, look for the UTLX or Procor markings that identify our tank cars. When you spot the brand, puff out your chest; you own a portion of that car.

Here’s the earnings recap for this sector:

Held under contract of sale for this amount. Berkshire has one major equity position that is not included in the table: We can buy 700 million shares of Bank of America at any time prior to September 2021 for $5 billion. At yearend these shares were worth $11.8 billion. We are likely to purchase them just before expiration of our option and, if we wish, we can use our $5 billion of Bank of America 6% preferred to fund the purchase. In the meantime, it is important for you to realize that Bank of America is, in effect, our fourth largest equity investment — and one we value highly.
Productivity and ProsperityEarlier, I told you how our partners at Kraft Heinz root out inefficiencies, thereby increasing output per hour of employment. That kind of improvement has been the secret sauce of America’s remarkable gains in living standards since the nation’s founding in 1776. Unfortunately, the label of “secret” is appropriate: Too few Americans fully grasp the linkage between productivity and prosperity. To see that connection, let’s look first at the country’s most dramatic example — farming — and later examine three Berkshire-specific areas.

In 1900, America’s civilian work force numbered 28 million. Of these, 11 million, a staggering 40% of the total, worked in farming. The leading crop then, as now, was corn. About 90 million acres were devoted to its production and the yield per acre was 30 bushels, for a total output of 2.7 billion bushels annually.

Then came the tractor and one innovation after another that revolutionized such keys to farm productivity as planting, harvesting, irrigation, fertilization and seed quality. Today, we devote about 85 million acres to corn. Productivity, however, has improved yields to more than 150 bushels per acre, for an annual output of 13-14 billion bushels. Farmers have made similar gains with other products.

Increased yields, though, are only half the story: The huge increases in physical output have been accompanied by a dramatic reduction in the number of farm laborers (“human input”). Today about three million people work on farms, a tiny 2% of our 158-million-person work force. Thus, improved farming methods have allowed tens of millions of present-day workers to utilize their time and talents in other endeavors, a reallocation of human resources that enables Americans of today to enjoy huge quantities of non-farm goods and services they would otherwise lack.

It’s easy to look back over the 115-year span and realize how extraordinarily beneficial agricultural innovations have been — not just for farmers but, more broadly, for our entire society. We would not have anything close to the America we now know had we stifled those improvements in productivity. (It was fortunate that horses couldn’t vote.) On a day-to-day basis, however, talk of the “greater good” must have rung hollow to farm hands who lost their jobs to machines that performed routine tasks far more efficiently than humans ever could. We will examine this flip-side to productivity gains later in this section.

For the moment, however, let’s move on to three stories of efficiencies that have had major consequences for Berkshire subsidiaries. Similar transformations have been commonplace throughout American business.
       In  1947,  shortly  after  the  end  of  World  War  II,  the  American  workforce  totaled  44  million.  About

1.35 million workers were employed in the railroad industry. The revenue ton-miles of freight moved by Class I railroads that year totaled 655 billion.

By 2014, Class I railroads carried 1.85 trillion ton-miles, an increase of 182%, while employing only 187,000 workers, a reduction of 86% since 1947. (Some of this change involved passenger-related employees, but most of the workforce reduction came on the freight side.) As a result of this staggering improvement in productivity, the inflation-adjusted price for moving a ton-mile of freight has fallen by 55% since 1947, a drop saving shippers about $90 billion annually in current dollars.

Another startling statistic: If it took as many people now to move freight as it did in 1947, we would need well over three million railroad workers to handle present volumes. (Of course, that level of employment would raise freight charges by a lot; consequently, nothing close to today’s volume would actually move.)
Our own BNSF was formed in 1995 by a merger between Burlington Northern and Santa Fe. In 1996, the merged company’s first full year of operation, 411 million ton-miles of freight were transported by 45,000 employees. Last year the comparable figures were 702 million ton-miles (plus 71%) and 47,000 employees (plus only 4%). That dramatic gain in productivity benefits both owners and shippers. Safety at BNSF has improved as well: Reportable injuries were 2.04 per 200,000 man-hours in 1996 and have since fallen more than 50% to 0.95.             A bit more than a century ago, the auto was invented, and around it formed an industry that insures cars and their drivers. Initially, this business was written through traditional insurance agencies — the kind dealing in fire insurance. This agency-centric approach included high commissions and other underwriting expenses that consumed about 40¢ of the premium dollar. Strong local agencies were then in the driver’s seat because they represented multiple insurers and could play one company off against another when commissions were being negotiated. Cartel-like pricing prevailed, and all involved were doing fine — except for the consumer.

And then some American ingenuity came into play: G. J. Mecherle, a farmer from Merna, Illinois, came up with the idea of a captive sales force that would sell the insurance products of only a single company. His baby was christened State Farm Mutual. The company cut commissions and expenses — moves that permitted lower prices — and soon became a powerhouse. For many decades, State Farm has been the runaway volume leader in both auto and homeowner’s insurance. Allstate, which also operated with a direct distribution model, was long the runner-up. Both State Farm and Allstate have had underwriting expenses of about 25%.

In the early 1930s, another contender, United Services Auto Association (“USAA”), a mutual-like company, was writing auto insurance for military officers on a direct-to-the-customer basis. This marketing innovation rose from a need that military personnel had to buy insurance that would stay with them as they moved from base to base. That was business of little interest to local insurance agencies, which wanted the steady renewals that came from permanent residents.

The direct distribution method of USAA, as it happened, incurred lower costs than those enjoyed by State Farm and Allstate and therefore delivered an even greater bargain to customers. That made Leo and Lillian Goodwin, employees of USAA, dream of broadening the target market for its direct distribution model beyond military officers. In 1936, starting with $100,000 of capital, they incorporated Government Employees Insurance Co. (later compressing this mouthful to GEICO).

Their fledgling did $238,000 of auto insurance business in 1937, its first full year. Last year GEICO did
$22.6 billion, more than double the volume of USAA. (Though the early bird gets the worm, the second mouse gets the cheese.) GEICO’s underwriting expenses in 2015 were 14.7% of premiums, with USAA being the only large company to achieve a lower percentage. (GEICO is fully as efficient as USAA but spends considerably more on advertising aimed at promoting growth.)

With the price advantage GEICO’s low costs allow, it’s not surprising that several years ago the company seized the number two spot in auto insurance from Allstate. GEICO is also gaining ground on State Farm, though it is still far ahead of us in volume. On August 30, 2030 — my 100th birthday — I plan to announce that GEICO has taken over the top spot. Mark your calendar.

GEICO employs about 34,000 people to serve its 14 million policyholders. I can only guess at the workforce it would require to serve a similar number of policyholders under the agency system. I believe, however, that the number would be at least 60,000, a combination of what the insurer would need in direct employment and the personnel required at supporting agencies.           In its electric utility business, our Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) operates within a changing economic model. Historically, the survival of a local electric company did not depend on its efficiency. In fact, a “sloppy” operation could do just fine financially.

That’s because utilities were usually the sole supplier of a needed product and were allowed to price at a level that gave them a prescribed return upon the capital they employed. The joke in the industry was that a utility was the only business that would automatically earn more money by redecorating the boss’s office. And some CEOs ran things accordingly.

That’s all changing. Today, society has decided that federally-subsidized wind and solar generation is in our country’s long-term interest. Federal tax credits are used to implement this policy, support that makes renewables price-competitive in certain geographies. Those tax credits, or other government-mandated help for renewables, may eventually erode the economics of the incumbent utility, particularly if it is a high-cost operator. BHE’s long-established emphasis on efficiency — even when the company didn’t need it to attain authorized earnings — leaves us particularly competitive in today’s market (and, more important, in tomorrow’s as well).

BHE acquired its Iowa utility in 1999. In the year before, that utility employed 3,700 people and produced 19 million megawatt-hours of electricity. Now we employ 3,500 people and produce 29 million megawatt- hours. That major increase in efficiency allowed us to operate without a rate increase for 16 years, a period during which industry rates increased 44%.

The safety record of our Iowa utility is also outstanding. It had .79 injuries per 100 employees in 2015 compared to the rate of 7.0 experienced by the previous owner in the year before we bought the operation.

In 2006 BHE purchased PacifiCorp, which operated primarily in Oregon and Utah. The year before our purchase PacifiCorp employed 6,750 people and produced 52.6 million megawatt-hours. Last year the numbers were 5,700 employees and 56.3 million megawatt-hours. Here, too, safety improved dramatically, with the accident-rate-per-100-employees falling from 3.4 in 2005 to .85 in 2015. In safety, BHE now ranks in the industry’s top decile.

Those outstanding performances explain why BHE is welcomed by regulators when it proposes to buy a utility in their jurisdiction. The regulators know the company will run an efficient, safe and reliable operation and also arrive with unlimited capital to fund whatever projects make sense. (BHE has never paid a dividend to Berkshire since we assumed ownership. No investor-owned utility in America comes close to matching BHE’s enthusiasm for reinvestment.)     * * * * * * * * * * * *

The productivity gains that I’ve just spelled out — and countless others that have been achieved in America have delivered awesome benefits to society. That’s the reason our citizens, as a whole, have enjoyed — and will continue to enjoy — major gains in the goods and services they receive.

To this thought there are offsets. First, the productivity gains achieved in recent years have largely benefitted the wealthy. Second, productivity gains frequently cause upheaval: Both capital and labor can pay a terrible price when innovation or new efficiencies upend their worlds.

We need shed no tears for the capitalists (whether they be private owners or an army of public shareholders). It’s their job to take care of themselves. When large rewards can flow to investors from good decisions, these parties should not be spared the losses produced by wrong choices. Moreover, investors who diversify widely and simply sit tight with their holdings are certain to prosper: In America, gains from winning investments have always far more than offset the losses from clunkers. (During the 20th Century, the Dow Jones Industrial Average — an index fund of sorts — soared from 66 to 11,497, with its component companies all the while paying ever-increasing dividends.)
A long-employed worker faces a different equation. When innovation and the market system interact to produce efficiencies, many workers may be rendered unnecessary, their talents obsolete. Some can find decent employment elsewhere; for others, that is not an option.

When low-cost competition drove shoe production to Asia, our once-prosperous Dexter operation folded, putting 1,600 employees in a small Maine town out of work. Many were past the point in life at which they could learn another trade. We lost our entire investment, which we could afford, but many workers lost a livelihood they could not replace. The same scenario unfolded in slow-motion at our original New England textile operation, which struggled for 20 years before expiring. Many older workers at our New Bedford plant, as a poignant example, spoke Portuguese and knew little, if any, English. They had no Plan B.

The answer in such disruptions is not the restraining or outlawing of actions that increase productivity. Americans would not be living nearly as well as we do if we had mandated that 11 million people should forever be employed in farming.

The solution, rather, is a variety of safety nets aimed at providing a decent life for those who are willing to work but find their specific talents judged of small value because of market forces. (I personally favor a reformed and expanded Earned Income Tax Credit that would try to make sure America works for those willing to work.) The price of achieving ever-increasing prosperity for the great majority of Americans should not be penury for the unfortunate.
Important RisksWe, like all public companies, are required by the SEC to annually catalog “risk factors” in our 10-K. I can’t remember, however, an instance when reading a 10-K’s “risk” section has helped me in evaluating a business. That’s not because the identified risks aren’t real. The truly important risks, however, are usually well known. Beyond that, a 10-K’s catalog of risks is seldom of aid in assessing: (1) the probability of the threatening event actually occurring; (2) the range of costs if it does occur; and (3) the timing of the possible loss. A threat that will only surface 50 years from now may be a problem for society, but it is not a financial problem for today’s investor.

Berkshire operates in more industries than any company I know of. Each of our pursuits has its own array of possible problems and opportunities. Those are easy to list but hard to evaluate: Charlie, I and our various CEOs often differ in a very major way in our calculation of the likelihood, the timing and the cost (or benefit) that may result from these possibilities.

Let me mention just a few examples. To begin with an obvious threat, BNSF, along with other railroads, is certain to lose significant coal volume over the next decade. At some point in the future — though not, in my view, for a long time — GEICO’s premium volume may shrink because of driverless cars. This development could hurt our auto dealerships as well. Circulation of our print newspapers will continue to fall, a certainty we allowed for when purchasing them. To date, renewables have helped our utility operation but that could change, particularly if storage capabilities for electricity materially improve. Online retailing threatens the business model of our retailers and certain of our consumer brands. These potentialities are just a few of the negative possibilities facing us — but even the most casual follower of business news has long been aware of them.

None of these problems, however, is crucial to Berkshire’s long-term well-being. When we took over the company in 1965, its risks could have been encapsulated in a single sentence: “The northern textile business in which all of our capital resides is destined for recurring losses and will eventually disappear.” That development, however, was no death knell. We simply adapted. And we will continue to do so.
Every day Berkshire managers are thinking about how they can better compete in an always-changing world. Just as vigorously, Charlie and I focus on where a steady stream of funds should be deployed. In that respect, we possess a major advantage over one-industry companies, whose options are far more limited. I firmly believe that Berkshire has the money, talent and culture to plow through the sort of adversities I’ve itemized above — and many more — and to emerge with ever-greater earning power.

There is, however, one clear, present and enduring danger to Berkshire against which Charlie and I are powerless. That threat to Berkshire is also the major threat our citizenry faces: a “successful” (as defined by the aggressor) cyber, biological, nuclear or chemical attack on the United States. That is a risk Berkshire shares with all of American business.

The probability of such mass destruction in any given year is likely very small. It’s been more than 70 years since I delivered a Washington Post newspaper headlining the fact that the United States had dropped the first atomic bomb. Subsequently, we’ve had a few close calls but avoided catastrophic destruction. We can thank our government — and luck! — for this result.

Nevertheless, what’s a small probability in a short period approaches certainty in the longer run. (If there is only one chance in thirty of an event occurring in a given year, the likelihood of it occurring at least once in a century is 96.6%.) The added bad news is that there will forever be people and organizations and perhaps even nations that would like to inflict maximum damage on our country. Their means of doing so have increased exponentially during my lifetime. “Innovation” has its dark side.

There is no way for American corporations or their investors to shed this risk. If an event occurs in the U.S. that leads to mass devastation, the value of all equity investments will almost certainly be decimated.

No one knows what “the day after” will look like. I think, however, that Einstein’s 1949 appraisal remains apt: “I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.”

I am writing this section because we have a proxy proposal regarding climate change to consider at this year’s annual meeting. The sponsor would like us to provide a report on the dangers that this change might present to our insurance operation and explain how we are responding to these threats.

It seems highly likely to me that climate change poses a major problem for the planet. I say “highly likely” rather than “certain” because I have no scientific aptitude and remember well the dire predictions of most “experts” about Y2K. It would be foolish, however, for me or anyone to demand 100% proof of huge forthcoming damage to the world if that outcome seemed at all possible and if prompt action had even a small chance of thwarting the danger.

This issue bears a similarity to Pascal’s Wager on the Existence of God. Pascal, it may be recalled, argued that if there were only a tiny probability that God truly existed, it made sense to behave as if He did because the rewards could be infinite whereas the lack of belief risked eternal misery. Likewise, if there is only a 1% chance the planet is heading toward a truly major disaster and delay means passing a point of no return, inaction now is foolhardy. Call this Noah’s Law: If an ark may be essential for survival, begin building it today, no matter how cloudless the skies appear.

It’s understandable that the sponsor of the proxy proposal believes Berkshire is especially threatened by climate change because we are a huge insurer, covering all sorts of risks. The sponsor may worry that property losses will skyrocket because of weather changes. And such worries might, in fact, be warranted if we wrote ten- or twenty-year policies at fixed prices. But insurance policies are customarily written for one year and repriced annually to reflect changing exposures. Increased possibilities of loss translate promptly into increased premiums.
Think back to 1951 when I first became enthused about GEICO. The company’s average loss-per-policy was then about $30 annually. Imagine your reaction if I had predicted then that in 2015 the loss costs would increase to about $1,000 per policy. Wouldn’t such skyrocketing losses prove disastrous, you might ask? Well, no.

Over the years, inflation has caused a huge increase in the cost of repairing both the cars and the humans involved in accidents. But these increased costs have been promptly matched by increased premiums. So, paradoxically, the upward march in loss costs has made insurance companies far more valuable. If costs had remained unchanged, Berkshire would now own an auto insurer doing $600 million of business annually rather than one doing $23 billion.

Up to now, climate change has not produced more frequent nor more costly hurricanes nor other weather- related events covered by insurance. As a consequence, U.S. super-cat rates have fallen steadily in recent years, which is why we have backed away from that business. If super-cats become costlier and more frequent, the likely — though far from certain — effect on Berkshire’s insurance business would be to make it larger and more profitable.

As a citizen, you may understandably find climate change keeping you up nights. As a homeowner in a low-lying area, you may wish to consider moving. But when you are thinking only as a shareholder of a major insurer, climate change should not be on your list of worries.
The Annual MeetingCharlie and I have finally decided to enter the 21st th. The Yahoo! webcast will begin with a half hour of interviews with managers, directors and shareholders. Then, at 9:30, Charlie and I will commence answering questions.

This new arrangement will serve two purposes. First, it may level off or modestly decrease attendance at the meeting. Last year’s record of more than 40,000 attendees strained our capacity. In addition to quickly filling the CenturyLink Center’s main arena, we packed its overflow rooms and then spilled into two large meeting rooms at the adjoining Omaha Hilton. All major hotels were sold out notwithstanding Airbnb’s stepped-up presence. Airbnb was especially helpful for those visitors on limited budgets.

Our second reason for initiating a webcast is more important. Charlie is 92, and I am 85. If we were partners with you in a small business, and were charged with running the place, you would want to look in occasionally to make sure we hadn’t drifted off into la-la land. Shareholders, in contrast, should not need to come to Omaha to monitor how we look and sound. (In making your evaluation, be kind: Allow for the fact that we didn’t look that impressive when we were at our best.)

Viewers can also observe our life-prolonging diet. During the meeting, Charlie and I will each consume enough Coke, See’s fudge and See’s peanut brittle to satisfy the weekly caloric needs of an NFL lineman. Long ago we discovered a fundamental truth: There’s nothing like eating carrots and broccoli when you’re really hungry — and want to stay that way.

Shareholders planning to attend the meeting should come at 7 a.m. when the doors open at CenturyLink Center and start shopping. Carrie Sova will again be in charge of the festivities. She had her second child late last month, but that did not slow her down. Carrie is unflappable, ingenious and expert at bringing out the best in those who work with her. She is aided by hundreds of Berkshire employees from around the country and by our entire home office crew as well, all of them pitching in to make the weekend fun and informative for our owners.
Last year we increased the number of hours available for shopping at the CenturyLink. Sales skyrocketed — so, naturally, we will stay with the new schedule. On Friday, April 29th you can shop between noon and 5 p.m., and on Saturday exhibits and stores will be open from 7 a.m. until 4:30 p.m.

On Saturday morning, we will have our fifth International Newspaper Tossing Challenge. Our target will again be a Clayton Home porch, located precisely 35 feet from the throwing line. When I was a teenager — in my one brief flirtation with honest labor — I delivered about 500,000 papers. So I think I’m pretty good at this game. Challenge me! Humiliate me! Knock me down a peg! The papers will run 36 to 42 pages, and you must fold them yourself (no rubber bands allowed).

The competition begins at 7:15, when contestants will make preliminary tosses. The eight throws judged most accurate — four made by contestants 12 or under, and four made by the older set — will compete against me at 7:45. The young challengers will each receive a prize. But the older ones will have to beat me to take anything home.

And be sure to check out the Clayton home itself. It can be purchased for $78,900, fully installed on land you provide. In past years, we’ve made many sales on the meeting day. Kevin Clayton will be on hand with his order book.

At 8:30 a.m., a new Berkshire movie will be shown. An hour later, we will start the question-and-answer period, which (including a break for lunch at CenturyLink’s stands) will last until 3:30 p.m. After a short recess, Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3:45 p.m. This business session typically lasts only a half hour or so and can safely be skipped by those craving a little last-minute shopping.

Your venue for shopping will be the 194,300-square-foot hall that adjoins the meeting and in which products from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries will be for sale. Say hello to the many Berkshire managers who will be captaining their exhibits. And be sure to view the terrific BNSF railroad layout that salutes all of our subsidiaries. Your children (and you!) will be enchanted with it.

We will have a new and very special exhibit in the hall this year: a full-size model of the world’s largest aircraft engine, for which Precision Castparts makes many key components. The real engines weigh about 20,000 pounds and are ten feet in diameter and 22 feet in length. The bisected model at the meeting will give you a good look at many PCC components that help power your flights.

Brooks, our running-shoe company, will again have a special commemorative shoe to offer at the meeting. After you purchase a pair, wear them on Sunday at our fourth annual “Berkshire 5K,” an 8 a.m. race starting at the CenturyLink. Full details for participating will be included in the Visitor’s Guide that will be sent to you with your meeting credentials. Entrants in the race will find themselves running alongside many of Berkshire’s managers, directors and associates. (Charlie and I, however, will sleep in; the fudge and peanut brittle take their toll.) Participation in the 5K grows every year. Help us set another record.

A GEICO booth in the shopping area will be staffed by a number of the company’s top counselors from around the country. Stop by for a quote. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a shareholder discount (usually 8%). This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which we operate. (One supplemental point: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another discount, such as that available to certain groups.) Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out our price. We can save many of you real money. Spend the savings on our other products.
Be sure to visit the Bookworm. It will carry about 35 books and DVDs, among them a couple of new titles. Andy Kilpatrick will introduce (and be glad to sign) the latest edition of his all-encompassing coverage of Berkshire. It’s 1,304 pages and weighs 9.8 pounds. (My blurb for the book: “Ridiculously skimpy.”) Check out Peter Bevelin’s new book as well. Peter has long been a keen observer of Berkshire.

We will also have a new, 20-page-longer edition of Berkshire’s 50-year commemorative book that at last year’s meeting sold 12,000 copies. Since then, Carrie and I have uncovered additional material that we find fascinating, such as some very personal letters sent by Grover Cleveland to Edward Butler, his friend and the then- publisher of The Buffalo News. Nothing from the original edition has been changed or eliminated, and the price remains $20. Charlie and I will jointly sign 100 copies that will be randomly placed among the 5,000 available for sale at the meeting.

My friend, Phil Beuth, has written Limping on Water, an autobiography that chronicles his life at Capital Cities Communications and tells you a lot about its leaders, Tom Murphy and Dan Burke. These two were the best managerial duo — both in what they accomplished and how they did it — that Charlie and I ever witnessed. Much of what you become in life depends on whom you choose to admire and copy. Start with Tom Murphy, and you’ll never need a second exemplar.

Finally, Jeremy Miller has written Warren Buffett’s Ground Rules, a book that will debut at the annual meeting. Mr. Miller has done a superb job of researching and dissecting the operation of Buffett Partnership Ltd. and of explaining how Berkshire’s culture has evolved from its BPL origin. If you are fascinated by investment theory and practice, you will enjoy this book.

An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the credential you will need for admission to both the meeting and other events. Airlines have sometimes jacked up prices for the Berkshire weekend. If you are coming from far away, compare the cost of flying to Kansas City vs. Omaha. The drive between the two cities is about 2 1⁄2 hours, and it may be that Kansas City can save you significant money, particularly if you had planned to rent a car in Omaha. The savings for a couple could run to
$1,000 or more. Spend that money with us.

At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, we will again be having “Berkshire Weekend” discount pricing. Last year in the week encompassing the meeting, the store did a record $44,239,493 of business. If you repeat that figure to a retailer, he is not going to believe you. (An average week for NFM’s Omaha store — the highest-volume home furnishings store in the United States except for our new Dallas store — is about $9 million.)

To obtain the Berkshire discount at NFM, you must make your purchases between Tuesday, April 26th and Monday, May 2nd inclusive, and also present your meeting credential. The period’s special pricing will even apply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but which, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you. We appreciate their cooperation. During “Berkshire Weekend” NFM will be open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. on Saturday and 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Sunday. From 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Saturday, NFM is hosting a picnic to which you are all invited.

At Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Friday, April 29th. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 1st, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. On Saturday, we will remain open until 6 p.m. During last year’s Friday-Sunday stretch, the store wrote a sales ticket every 15 seconds that it was open.

We will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore, shareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 25th through Saturday, May 7th. During that period, please identify yourself as a shareholder either by presenting your meeting credential or a brokerage statement showing you own our stock.

On Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, Norman Beck, a remarkable magician from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers. On the upper level, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon Osberg, two of the world’s top bridge experts, available to play bridge with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon. I will join them and hope to have Ajit and Charlie there also.

My friend, Ariel Hsing, will be in the mall as well on Sunday, taking on challengers at table tennis. I met Ariel when she was nine and even then I was unable to score a point against her. Now, she’s a junior at Princeton, having already represented the United States in the 2012 Olympics. If you don’t mind embarrassing yourself, test your skills against her, beginning at 1 p.m. Bill Gates and I will lead off and try to soften her up.

Gorat’s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 1st, serving from 1 p.m. until 10 p.m. To make a reservation at Gorat’s, call 402-551-3733 on April 1st (but not before). As for my other favorite restaurant, Piccolo’s, I’m sad to report it closed.



From the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the six he or she decides are the most interesting and important. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selected if you keep it concise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no more than two questions in any e-mail you send them. (In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would like your name mentioned if your question is asked.)

An accompanying set of questions will be asked by three analysts who follow Berkshire. This year the insurance specialist will be Cliff Gallant of Nomura Securities. Questions that deal with our non-insurance operations will come from Jonathan Brandt of Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb and Gregg Warren of Morningstar. Our hope is that the analysts and journalists will ask questions that add to our owners’ understanding and knowledge of their investment.

Neither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions headed our way. Some will be tough, for sure, and that’s the way we like it. Multi-part questions aren’t allowed; we want to give as many questioners as possible a shot at us.

All told we expect at least 54 questions, which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist and for 18 from the audience. (Last year we had 64 in total.) The questioners from the audience will be chosen by means of 11 drawings that will take place at 8:15 a.m. on the morning of the annual meeting. Each of the 11 microphones installed in the arena and main overflow room will host, so to speak, a drawing.
While I’m on the subject of our owners’ gaining knowledge, let me remind you that Charlie and I believe all shareholders should simultaneously have access to new information that Berkshire releases and, if possible, should also have adequate time to digest and analyze it before any trading takes place. That’s why we try to issue financial data late on Fridays or early on Saturdays and why our annual meeting is always held on a Saturday. We do not follow the common practice of talking one-on-one with large institutional investors or analysts, treating them instead as we do all other shareholders. There is no one more important to us than the shareholder of limited means who trusts us with a substantial portion of his savings.

* * * * * * * * * * * *

For good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are truly All-Stars who run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I also believe the mindset of our managers to be as shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-owned companies. Most of our managers have no financial need to work. The joy of hitting business “home runs” means as much to them as their paycheck.

Equally important, however, are the 24 men and women who work with me at our corporate office. This group efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 30,400-page Federal income tax return — that’s up 6,000 pages from the prior year! — oversees the filing of 3,530 state tax returns, responds to countless shareholder and media inquiries, gets out the annual report, prepares for the country’s largest annual meeting, coordinates the Board’s activities, fact-checks this letter — and the list goes on and on.

They handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life easy and pleasant. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: Last year, for example, they dealt with the 40 universities (selected from 200 applicants) who sent students to Omaha for a Q&A day with me. They also handle all kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers and french fries (smothered in Heinz ketchup, of course) for lunch. No CEO has it better; I truly do feel like tap dancing to work every day. In fact, my job becomes more fun every year.

In 2015, Berkshire’s revenues increased by $16 billion. Look carefully, however, at the two pictures on the facing page. The top one is from last year’s report and shows the entire Berkshire home-office crew at our Christmas lunch. Below that photo is this year’s Christmas photo portraying the same 25 people identically positioned. In 2015, no one joined us, no one left. And the odds are good that you will see a photo of the same 25 next year.

Can you imagine another very large company — we employ 361,270 people worldwide — enjoying that kind of employment stability at headquarters? At Berkshire we have hired some wonderful people — and they have stayed with us. Moreover, no one is hired unless he or she is truly needed. That’s why you’ve never read about “restructuring” charges at Berkshire.

On April 30th, come to Omaha — the cradle of capitalism — and meet my gang. They are the best.

82,(Ghost) Riders In The Sky,"[Chorus]
Yippie-I-ay, yippie-I-o
Ghost riders in the sky

[Verse 1]
An old cowpoke went ridin' out
One dark and windy day (yippie-I-ay)
Upon a ridge he rested
As he went along his way
When all at once a mighty bunch
Of red eyed cows he saw
Plowin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw

[Chorus]
Yippie-I-ay, yippie-I-o
Ghost riders in the sky

[Verse 2]
Their brands were still on fire
And their hoofs were made of steel (yippie-I-ay)
Their horns were black and shiny
And the hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him
As they thundered through the sky
He saw the riders commin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry

[Chorus]
Yippie-I-ay, yippie-I-o
Ghost riders in the sky

[Verse 3]
Their faces gaunt
Their eyes were blurred
Their shirts all soaked with sweat (yippie-I-ay)
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd
But they ain't caught 'em yet'
'Cause you've gotta ride forever
On that range up in the sky
On horses snorting fire
As they ride on, hear their cry

[Chorus]
Yippie-I-ay, yippie-I-o
Ghost riders in the sky

[Verse 4]
As the riders went on by him
He heard one call his name (yippie-I-ay)
If you want to save your soul
From ever ridin' on our range
Then cowboy change your way today
Or with us you will ride
Tryin' to catch the devil's herd
Across the endless skies

[Chorus]

Still, I remember the love we shared that we’d meet in some new place
We made the vow at full moon's glow to find each other again
From another life another time I hear you in the night

I'm so hot for her and she's so cold

Yeah, I tried re-wiring her
Tried re-firing her
I think her engine is permanently stalled

She's so cold she's so cold

She's so cold she's so cold

Who would believe you were a beauty indeed
When the days get shorter and the nights get long
Lie awake when the rain comes
Nobody will know, when you're old
When you're old, nobody will know
That you was a beauty, a sweet sweet beauty
A sweet sweet beauty, but stone stone cold

You're so cold, you're so cold, cold, cold

101,You Shook Me All Night Long,"[Verse 1]
She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen
She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies
Knocking me out with those American thighs
Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air
She told me to come, but I was already there
'Cause the walls start shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it

[Chorus]
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long

[Verse 2]
Working double-time on the seduction line
She's one of a kind, she's just a-mine all mine
Wanted no applause, just another course
Made a meal outta me, and come back for more
Had to cool me down to take another round
Now, I'm back in the ring to take another swing
That the walls were shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it

[Chorus]
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long
It knocked me out that
You shook me all night long
It had me shaking
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
Well, you took me

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
You really took me and
You shook me all night long

102,Morning Man,"I arise to the 5 AM skies
Left over from yesterday
With a moan I reach out for the phone
It's her says, she's on her way

And fifteen minutes later
I hear the elevator
I gave her my apartment key
So she eases in and lies with me

Pay my way with a nine to five day
She's working a midnight grind
Dressed in white by the dawn's eerie light
She reaches my cobwebbed mind

She brews us up some coffee
And pulls the covers off me
I grab her wrist and pull her near
And the night begins to clear

Morning man, doesn't take much to wake me
Just you shake your morning man
I've been dreaming of how you'll wake me
Since this endless night began

So curl up with your early riser
In my eyes you see the plan
You'll catch up on your sleep this evening
And I'll be your morning man

Eight at night in the last of the light
I wander back home again
Time is cheap 'cause I know she's asleep
And out for the count 'til ten

And when she's finally wakin'
I'll fix some eggs and bacon
She'll say, ""Goodnight, I'm late again""
I'll say, ""Goodnight, I'll wait""

Morning man, doesn't take much to wake me
Just you shake your morning man
I've been dreaming of how you'll wake me
Since this endless night began

So curl up with your early riser
In my eyes you see the plan
You'll catch up on your sleep this evening
And I'll be your morning man",Rupert Holmes,1980,"[95, 84, 68, 70, 71, 75, 85]",7

You all about the Hawk, nigga, that G5 is quality
It's pink, way more than I ever would've imagined
I didn't measure it so I'm higher than Aladdin
No swaps out, I'm undecided whenever I pop out
I had to swerve for four years, I'm still under forty thousand miles
Bought the Bentley coupe and a Bentley Spur on the same day
She drove the GT and fell in love with it the same day
She told me that was her favorite car, she dreamed about it
I couldn't walk away, my ego all in the way
I dropped cash on it, she told me she loved me even more (Freebandz)
These four doors and quaaludes, they got me dehydrated
Turn on me, sue me, no, nothing seems to amaze me
I left on a commercial flight and downgraded
If I could change anything, I wouldn't erase it (I wouldn't erase it)
Came back on a private plane and upgraded (I made it)
It had to be destiny, it had to be the recipe
Had to be the formula, I'm not normal, I told you (I told you)
If you would've took the flesh out me (Took the flesh out me)
You would've ran off with it and tried to convince me it was karma

Wasn't for her I don't know what I'd done
She gave me back something that was missing in me
She could of turned out to be almost anyone
Almost anyone--
With the possible exception
Of who I wanted her to be

Running into the midnight
With her clothes whipping in the wind
Reaching into the heart of the darkness
For the tenderness within
Stumblin' into the lights of the city
And then back in the shadows again
Hanging onto the laughter
That each of us hid our unhappiness in

Talk about celestial bodies
And your angels on the wing
She wasn't much good at stickin' around--but
That girl could sing
She could sing...

In the dead of night
She could shine a light
On some places that you've never been
In that kind of light
You could lose your sight
And believe there was something to win
You could hold her tight
With all your might
But she'd slip through your arms like the wind
And be back in flight
Back into the night
Where you might never see her again

The longer I thought I might find her
The shorter my vision became
Running in circles behind her
And thinking in terms of the blame
But she couldn't have been any kinder
If she'd come back and tried to explain
She wasn't much good a saying goodbye--but
That girl could sing",Jackson Browne,1980,"[98, 86, 63, 48, 22, 22, 24, 27, 33, 44, 49, 67, 82]",13

110,Texas In My Rear View Mirror,"I was just fifteen and outta control
Lost to James Dean and rock and roll
I knew down deep in my country soul
That I had to get away

Hollywood was a lady in red
Who danced in my dreams
As I tossed in bed
I knew I'd wind up
In jail or dead
If I had to stay

I thought happiness
Was Lubbock, Texas
In my rear view mirror
My momma kept calling me home
But I just did not want to hear her
And the vision was getting clearer
In my dreams

So I laid out one night in June
Stoned on the glow of the Texas moon
Humming an old Buddy Holly tune
Called Peggy Sue

With my favorite jeans
And a cheap guitar

I ran off chasing a distant star
If Buddy Holly could make it that far
I figured I could too

And I thought happiness
Was Lubbock, Texas
In my rear view mirror
My momma kept calling me home
But I just did not want to hear her
And the vision was getting clearer
In my dreams

But the Hollywood moon didn't
Smile the same old smile
That I'd grown up with
The lady in red
Just wanted my last dime

And I cried myself to sleep at night
Too dumb to run, too scared to fight
And too proud to admit it at the time

So I got me some gigs on Saturday nights
Not much more than orchestrated fights
I'd come home drunk and I'd try to write
But the words came out wrong

Hell bent and bound for a wasted youth
Too much gin and not enough vermouth
And no one to teach me
How to seek the truth
Before I put it into song

I still thought happiness
Was Lubbock, Texas
In my rear view mirror
My momma kept calling me home
But I just could not, would not hear her
And the vision was getting clearer
In my dreams

Well, I thank God each and every day
For giving me the music and words to say
I'd-a never made it any other way
He was my only friend

Now I sleep a little better at night
When I look in the mirror
In the morning light
The man I see was both wrong and right
He's going home again

I guess happiness was Lubbock, Texas
In my rear view mirror
But now happiness is Lubbock, Texas
Growing nearer and dearer
And the vision is getting clearer
In my dreams

And I think I finally know
Just what it means
And when I die you can bury me
In Lubbock, Texas, in my jeans",Mac Davis,1980,"[100, 69, 51, 51, 55, 57, 67, 77, 87]",9

This is exactly what I wanted
All my fans love me, dad is proud of me
Mama cries for me
'Cause she know there ain't sleep in my schedule
Having nightmares that I'm the black Heath Ledger
Sleep when I'm dead, these voices in my head
Got me waking up at 4 just so I can write instead
And my friends come and ask me if it's worth it
I tell them that ""It better be, I did this shit on purpose!""
The worst is being worthless, now a nigga priceless
Bloomingdale's coat, I don't have to check the prices
But I only go to feel a sense of control
'Cause I get this shit for free if I wear promotional
And I'm not emotional when I do my work
I get emotional when I order that dessert
'Cause she always ate dessert
And I deserted her
But I refuse to compromise career for a girl
'Cause this music and this writing and this acting is my soul
And if I let it go, there'd be no one left to know
Being happy is the goal, but greatness is my vision
And all these girls are thinking they compete with my ambition
But, baby, I am different
This shit is my life
And if you don't believe me, you can never be wife
I'm walking in this darkness and I'm tryna find a light
And I'd rather die than be average and chances are I might, because

I'll always remember
That magic moment
When I held you close to me

As we move together
I knew forever
You're all I'll ever need

Could I have this dance
For the rest of my life
Could you be my partner

Could I have this dance

118,Fame,"[Intro: RAF Camora & Kontra K]
Heut sind wir alle noch zusamm'n im Park
So viel Zeit, wissen nicht mal, wohin
Maximal Kleingeld auf Tasche
So weit weg von Gold und Platin (Platin), ey
Auf MTV Cribs seh'n wir die Stars
Doch alles, was sie hab'n, macht für uns keinen Sinn
Doch geben ein'n Dreck auf die Rolex
Hauptsache, zusamm'n mit dem Team

[Part 1: Kontra K]
Wir hatten zu wenig, aber davon reichlich
Die Air Max tot, aber trugen uns weit weg
Heute im Mercedes AMG, alles Hightech
Was bringt mir die Scheiße, wenn ich darin allein sitz'?
Worte hatten recht, weil sie ehrlich gemeint sind
Versprechen einen Sinn, denn sie wurden gehalten
Doch hier ist die Liebe keinen Cent mehr wert
Denn sie hält nur so lange, wie die Spotlights scheinen
Warum willst du weg von dem Glück, was du hast?
Es wäre perfekt, genau so, wie es war
Ich halt' den Moment fest, solang ich noch kann
Doch er verschwindet im Schatten, geht das Rampenlicht an
Es wird nie sein wie früher, wir nenn'n uns noch Brüder
Und seh'n uns maximal einmal im Jahr
Doch jedes Like, jeder Gig, jede goldene Platte
Zerschneidet nur weiter das Band

[Hook: RAF Camora]
Ich hoffe, du wirst niemals fame
Denn erst dann merkst du, was wirklich fehlt
Du bist weg, auf nie Wiedersehen
Dein Leben wird uns nur von Bildern erzählt
Ich hoffe, du wirst niemals fame
Denn erst dann merkst du, was wirklich fehlt
Du bist weg, auf nie Wiedersehen
Dein Leben wird uns nur von Bildern erzählt

Doch geben ein'n Dreck auf die Rolex
Hauptsache, zusamm'n mit dem Team

[Part 2: Kontra K]
Denn Gold am Arm hält nachts nicht warm
Paranoia dich wach, die Waffen scharf
Statt Loyalität, die dein'n Rücken schützt
Hängt hinter dir nur noch ein Rattenschwanz von Neidern
Alles klebt an dein'n Lippen wie die Filter von Kippen
Weil niemand mehr nein sagt
Gottverdammt, bist du einsam
Kein Klick, kein Reim, keine Bitch, kein Like
Kein Hit, kein Hype bleibt mehr, wenn du liegst
Kein Fick, kein Nike, kein Stift, kein Mic
Kein Blitzlicht scheint mehr sechs Fuß tief
Nur noch Erde und Knochen
Und keine Wand voll mit Platten aus Gold
Ich gönn' dir von Herzen (glaub mir, von Herzen)
Doch nichts ist umsonst und erst recht nicht Erfolg

Du kannst grüßen, wen du willst
Keiner denkt mehr an dich im Bezirk
Denn du bist nicht mehr hier
Als hättest du nie existiert, ahh
Scheiß auf deine YouTube-Klicks
Wir treffen uns nicht einmal zum Kaffee
Nicht mal „Hallo, wie geht's?“
Bruder, was ist passiert?
Denk' an die Tage
Und weiß noch, wie ich zu dir sagte

But all I'm really asking for is a chance to
Just to make you happy baby
Never leave you lonely. I'd never make you blue
There's not a thing that I would do
That I wouldn't' do for you
I'd give the world if I could give it
Everything I have
So won't you give my love a chance
I could treat you right
Make you have good dreams at night
I could be good for you
I could be good so good so good so good
Treat you kind
Change the way you feel inside
I could be good for you
I could be good so good so good so good
I could be good (good for you) I could be good
Baby I got lots of ways to keep a smile on your face
I'll show you, let me show you
When I hold you in the night you'll see
That what I've got is what you need
I'll show you I can make you happy baby
Never give you reason to ever leave my side
I'll keep the rain away and baby I'll keep you satisfied
Won't be anyone who'll love you better than the way I can
So won't you give my love a chance

So if you're thinkin' 'bout love
Won't you think about me
If you're needing someone

[Verse 1]
Now this is you, dressed in all black, fatigue hat, ready for combat
A good nigga, you don't leave tracks
A hood nigga wantin' G-stacks, do what you gotta do to get that
You feel you need that, where the juxs at?
These are your niggas, creepin' they be leavin' niggas sleep witchu
Loc' style, quiet no smile, it's the official
Sometime they grimy, speakin' on they own people
They snake you if they have to, raised tattoos
Now these are your bitches, phonin' lonely homie chickens
All the homies stick 'em, you think you own 'em man, listen
She stab you in your sleep with a knife from out the kitchen
Put a root on you, next week they find you missin'
Dead in your Expedition in the forest, fell off the cliff and
Tumbled 'til you blew up, Feds told her and she threw up
Fake bitches, actresses, wicked witch practices
Two sides of us, negative and positive

[Verse 2]
Now this is your mom, your good luck charm
Pushin you to do no wrong, prayin for you that you live long
Nobody kill my baby, but she know her baby crazy
In and out of jail, mom's screamin', ""God take me!""
This is your pop, chip off the old block that made him
The man of the house, mom and pops separatin'
Spittin' image of a gangsta, the way pop walked
The way pop talked, got older and you thanked him now
This is your hood, poor folks drugs and robberies
Turnin' into the things moms wanted you not to be
Crime followin' the wrong dudes who have no values
Life's cheap as the dime in the minds of those around you
This is the test, the stress, the conflict the ups and downs of
Niggas around you make threats
They tell you keep it gangsta, no matter the predicament
Even though your decision won't help you benefit

Some of us have angels (the kingdom, the power)
Some of us have angels (the power, the glory)
Some of us have demons (greed, and lust)
Some of us have demons (lust, temptation)

Some of us have angels (the power, the glory)
Some of us have demons (greed, and lust)

[Verse 3]
Now once again this is you, entertainin' your desires
Bitches, money and guns, aimin' and you fire
Everyday is grief, if it ain't beef, it's feedin' your seed
Tryin' to eat? You form material needs
The weed make your brain sizzle, a pistol make it cool off
By stickin' up niggas, make them take they jewels off
His reputation is, bigger than his whole life span
He never planned to fail, he just failed to plan
What does it take to realize, Satan's alive, he whispers
And any chance he get, he can take niggas
He comes in all shapes and sizes, his best disguise is
When he stand beside us, but God is inside us, within me
You are your worst enemy - my mom's words echo in my head
And if I let go I'm dead
He stepped at my door, the takes motivate my spirit
An out of body experience, so now I feel it
Lookin' at my blessings, the bullets - that missed me coulda hit me
Them court cases coulda put me in the penitentiary
I never hate, that's just wasted energy
The past is gone, the present's a gift, so what's the mystery?
The future - and time only reveals, what fear is
False expectations, appearin' real
We only human, love thy neighbor, so I was told
And I will 'til permanently, my eyes are closed

[Chorus]
Some of us have angels (the kingdom, the power)
Some of us have angels (the power, the glory)
Some of us have demons (greed, and lust)
Some of us have demons (lust, temptation)
Some of us have angels (the kingdom, the power)
Some of us have angels (the power, the glory)
Some of us have demons (greed, and lust)
Some of us have demons (lust, temptation)",Nas,1980,"[79, 79, 89]",3

The first thing I remember
When you came into my life
I said I'm gonna get that girl
No matter what I do

Well I guess I'd been in love before
And once or twice I been on the floor
But I never loved no one
The way that I loved you

And it was late in the evening
And all the music seeping through

The first thing I remember
When you came into my life
I said I'm gonna get that girl

126,Love X Love,"Remember the days when we never had a dime
And our dreams seemed a million miles away
But we made it baby
Facin' the bad times with a smile
Here we are and we're growin' stronger day by day

And girl it sure feels good to know

Blue jeans can't hide the bare facts
Bad boy knows where to find her
Runs the light, sneaks up behind her

How you raise your voice and yellin' at me in my house?
Look I should kick you out if you want to scream and shout
Cause I'm just not in the mood for a heavy weight bout
Oh, that's what's up then
You keep on interruptin'
Like you runnin' thangs, hold up let me tell you somethin'
You can roll your eyes and stomp your feet
But your mouth might put your ass out in the street
Open your mouth again, the story never ends
Talkin' to me crazy like I'm one of your friends
I can't get a word in
You should try listenin'
I should call you Tyler Perry since you always dissin' men

Ain't the reason why you got your panties all in a bunch

For one week a month you always make my life so miserable
So, here we go gettin' loud and obnoxious
When really what you need is some Motrin and chocolate
I'm only jokin'
On the low, kinda hopin'
That comedy will calm your ass down for the moment
I wanna turn the game on
You busy with the same song
Okay, I'm not right but look, I know I ain't wrong
You ain't goin' nowhere
Put them bags down
Got your hands in my face
Oh you think you bad now?
Okay

Knock yourself out cause I'm not the one to hit you
And I ain't sleepin' on the couch
My neck's still hurtin' from the last time
We gotta talk now?
C'mon, can't it wait till halftime?
It's like your favorite past time
You yell and you scream
But nothing comes between a man and his favorite team
And look
Don't make me choose cause you just might lose
Now, take your ass to the other room, turn on the news
Wait, wait wait wait wait wait
I didn't mean it like that
I'm just excited from the game
C'mon baby come back
Look I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I got a little silly
But c'mon what really arguin' about now really?
You know I love you
You know you love me
But why does it always have to get so ugly?
Don't even want to hug me because you wanna stay mad
It's the crazy game that men and women play since way back
But men never win, so forget it man I'm out
Cause I already planned on sleepin' on the couch

You know what? Know what? Forget it, forget it. I'm finished. La la la la
Where's the remote? I'm takin' the good covers too

Don't try to call me back in there later either. I'm out this mother!

Wait a minute what? What did you say you gonna do to my Impala?
I'll jump out this car so fast and drop kick you in the medulla oblongata
Okay I see you stupid just like your momma and them
Yeah I said it
And I was just as stupid as you for stayin' with you
Cause I regret it
So let me get in clean
Cause the game don't change, people do
These little niggas jumpin' out blastin' in them skinny jean
And the last thing I need is your ass to hassle
Yeah man she told the judge I hit her
She hit herself in the head with a bag of apple
And I told her, ""I hate goin' to your spot""
Cause her daddy can't say nothin'
Unless he put that thing on his neck that make him sound like a robot
And I sound retarded right?
I can't lie
One day a butterfly landed on a skull and brought tears to my eye
Think I'm ungrateful and she would never satisfy
Keep showin', they laugh at her cause her daddy got killed
Going to the hood tryin' to pay a nigga to pee on me
And you ever been with one or two bitches
Just you and her in the car
You know she farted but she lookin' at you like you did it
She kinda dirty to us

One day we went to apply to a phat loan

If you ever go back into Wooley Swamp son you better not go at night
There's things out there in the middle of them woods
That'd make a strong man die from fright
There's things that crawl and things that fly
And things that creep around on the ground
And they say the ghost of Lucius Clay gets up and it walks around

[Chorus]
But I couldn't believe it, I just had to find out for myself
And I couldn't conceive it, I never would listen to nobody else
No I couldn't believe it, I just had to find out for myself
That there's some things in this world you just can't explain

[Verse 2]
The old man lived in the Wooley Swamp way back in the gurgling woods
And he never did do a lot of harm in the world
But he never did do no good
People didn't think too much of him
They all thought he acted funny
The old man didn't care about people anyway
All he cared about was his money
He'd stuff it all down into Mason jars and bury it all around
And on certain nights if the moon was right
He'd dig it up out of the ground
He'd pour it all out on the floor of his shack
And run his fingers through it
Yeah, Lucius Clay was a greedy old man
And that's all there ever was to it

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The Crayton boys was white trash
And they lived over on Parvis Creek
They were a real snake and sneaky as a cat
And belligerent when they'd speak
One night the oldest brother said ya'll meet in the Wooley Swamp later
We'll get old Lucius' money and we'll pitch him to the alligators
They found the old man out in the back with a shovel in his hand
And thirteen rusty Mason jars he just dug up out of the sand
And they all went crazy and they beat the old man
Then they picked him up off the ground
Then they threw him in the swamp and they stood there and laughed
As the black water sucked him down
Then they turned around and went back to the shack
And they picked up the money and ran
But they hadn't gone nowhere when they realized
They were running in quicksand
And they struggled and screamed but they couldn't get away
Then just before they went under
They could hear that old man laughing
In a voice that was loud as thunder

[Bridge]
Now that's been fifty years ago an' if you go back by there again
There's a spot in the yard in back of that shack
Where the ground is always wet
And on certain nights if the moon is right
And you're down by the dark footpath
You can hear three young men screaming
And you can hear that old man laugh

ate mechanically, almost without tasting.

Vera said:

""I shall never eat tongue again.""

They finished the meal. They sat round the kitchen table staring at each other.

""Only four of us now... Who'll be the next?""

Armstrong stared. He said, almost mechanically:



""We must be very careful -"" and stopped.

Blore nodded.

""That's what he said... And now he's dead!""

""How did it happen, I wonder?""

Lombard swore. He said:

""A damned clever double cross! That stuff was planted in Miss Claythorne's room
and it worked just as it was intended to. Every one dashes up there thinking
she's being murdered. And so - in the confusion - some one - caught the old boy off
his guard.""

Blore said:

""Why didn't any one hear the shot?""

Lombard shook his head.

""Miss Claythorne was screaming, the wind was howling, we were running about
and calling out. No, it wouldn't be heard."" He paused. ""But that trick's not going
to work again. He'll have to try something else next time.""

Blore said:

""He probably will.""



There was an unpleasant tone in his voice. The two men eyed each other.

Armstrong said:

""Four of us, and we don't know which...""

Blore said:

""I know...""

Vera said:

""I haven't the least doubt...""

Armstrong said slowly:

""I suppose I do know really...""

Philip Lombard said:

""I think I've got a pretty good idea now...""

Again they all looked at each other...

Vera staggered to her feet. She said:

""I feel awful. I must go to bed... I'm dead beat.""

Lombard said:

""Might as well. No good sitting watching each other.""



Blore said:

""I've no objection...""

The doctor murmured:

""The best thing to do - although I doubt if any of us will sleep.""

They moved to the door. Blore said:

""I wonder where that revolver is now?...""



II



They went up the stairs.

The next move was a little like a scene in a farce.

Each one of the four stood with a hand on his or her bedroom door handle. Then,
as though at a signal, each one stepped into the room and pulled the door shut.
There were sounds of bolts and locks, of the moving of furniture.

Four frightened people were barricaded in until morning.



Ill



Philip Lombard drew a breath of relief as he turned from adjusting a chair under
the door handle.



He strolled across to the dressing-table.

By the light of the flickering candle he studied his face curiously.

He said softly to himself:

""Yes, this business has got you rattled all right.""

His sudden wolf-like smile flashed out.

He undressed quickly.

He went over to the bed, placing his wrist-watch on the table by the bed.

Then he opened the drawer of the table.

He stood there, staring down at the revolver that was inside it...



IV



Vera Claythorne lay in bed.



The candle still burned beside her.



As yet she could not summon the courage to put it out.



She was afraid of the dark...



She told herself again and again: ""You're all right until morning. Nothing
happened last night. Nothing will happen tonight. Nothing can happen. You're
locked and bolted in. No one can come near you...""

And she thought suddenly:

""Of course! I can stay here! Stay here locked in! Food doesn't really matter! I can
stay here - safely - till help comes! Even if it's a day - or two days...""

Stay here. Yes, but could she stay here? Hour after hour - with no one to speak
to, with nothing to do but think...

She'd begin to think of Cornwall - of Hugo -of- of what she'd said to Cyril.

Horrid whiny little boy, always pestering her...

""Miss Claythorne, why can't I swim out to the rock? I can. I know I can.""

Was it her voice that had answered?

""Of course you can, Cyril, really. I know that.""

""Can I go then, Miss Claythorne?""

""Well, you see, Cyril, your mother gets so nervous about you. I'll tell you what.
Tomorrow you can swim out to the rock. I'll talk to your mother on the beach and
distract her attention. And then, when she looks for you, there you'll be standing
on the rock waving to her! It will be a surprise!""

""Oh, good egg, Miss Claythorne! That will be a lark!""



She'd said it now. Tomorrow! Hugo was going to Newquay. When he came back -
it would be all over...

Yes, but supposing it wasn't? Supposing it went wrong? Cyril might be rescued in
time. And then - then he'd say, ""Miss Claythorne said I could... Well, what of it?
One must take some risk! If the worst happened she'd brazen it out. ""How can
you tell such a wicked lie, Cyril? Of course I never said any such thing!"" They'd
believe her all right. Cyril often told stories. He was an untruthful child. Cyril
would know, of course. But that didn't matter... And anyway nothing would go
wrong. She'd pretend to swim out after him. But she'd arrive too late... Nobody
would ever suspect...

Had Hugo suspected? Was that why he had looked at her in that queer far-off
way...? Had Hugo known?

Was that why he had gone off after the inquest so hurriedly?

He hadn't answered the one letter she had written to him...



Hugo.



Vera turned restlessly in bed. No, no, she mustn't think of Hugo. It hurt too
much! That was all over, over and done with... Hugo must be forgotten...

Why, this evening, had she suddenly felt that Hugo was in the room with her?

She stared up at the ceiling, stared at the big black hook in the middle of the
room.

She'd never noticed that hook before.



The seaweed had hung from that...

She shivered as she remembered that cold clammy touch on her neck...

She didn't like that hook on the ceiling. It drew your eyes, fascinated you... a big
black hook...



V

Ex-Inspector Blore sat on the side of his bed.

His small eyes, red-rimmed and bloodshot, were alert in the solid mass of his
face. He was like a wild boar waiting to charge.

He felt no inclination to sleep.

The menace was coming very near now... Six out often!

For all his sagacity, for all his caution and astuteness, the old judge had gone the
way of the rest.

Blore snorted with a kind of savage satisfaction.

""What was it the old geezer had said?""

""We must be very careful...""

Self-righteous smug old hypocrite. Sitting up in court feeling like God Almighty.
He'd got his all right... No more being careful for him.



And now there were four of them. The girl, Lombard, Armstrong and himself.

Very soon another of them would go... But it wouldn't be William Henry Blore.
He'd see to that all right.

(But the revolver... What about the revolver? That was the disturbing factor - the
revolver!)

Blore sat on his bed, his brow furrowed, his little eyes creased and puckered
while he pondered the problem of the revolver...

In the silence he could hear the clocks strike downstairs.

Midnight.

He relaxed a little now - even went so far as to lie down on his bed. But he did not
undress.

He lay there, thinking. Going over the whole business from the beginning,
methodically, painstakingly, as he had been wont to do in his police officer days.
It was thoroughness that paid in the end.

The candle was burning down. Looking to see if the matches were within easy
reach of his hand, he blew it out.

Strangely enough, he found the darkness disquieting. It was as though a
thousand age-old fears awoke and struggled for supremacy in his brain. Faces
floated in the air - the judge's face crowned with that mockery of grey wool - the
cold dead face of Mrs. Rogers - the convulsed purple face of Anthony Marston...

Another face - pale, spectacled, with a small straw-coloured moustache...



A face he had seen sometime or other - but when? Not on the island. No, much
longer ago than that.

Funny, that he couldn't put a name to it... Silly sort of face really - fellow looked a
bit of a mug.

Of course!

It came to him with a real shock.

Landor!

Odd to think he'd completely forgotten what Landor looked like. Only yesterday
he'd been trying to recall the fellow's face, and hadn't been able to.

And now here it was, every feature clear and distinct, as though he had seen it
only yesterday...

Landor had had a wife - a thin slip of a woman with a worried face. There'd been
a kid too, a girl about fourteen. For the first time, he wondered what had become
of them...

(The revolver. What had become of the revolver? That was much more
important...)

The more he thought about it the more puzzled he was... He didn't understand
this revolver business...

Somebody in the house had got that revolver...



Downstairs a clock struck one.

Blore's thoughts were cut short. He sat up on the bed, suddenly alert. For he had
heard a sound - a very faint sound - somewhere outside his bedroom door.

There was some one moving about in the darkened house.

The perspiration broke out on his forehead. Who was it, moving secretly and
silently along the corridors? Some one who was up to no good, he'd bet that!

Noiselessly, in spite of his heavy build, he dropped off the bed and with two
strides was standing by the door listening.

But the sound did not come again. Nevertheless Blore was convinced that he was
not mistaken. He had heard a footfall just outside his door. The hair rose slightly
on his scalp. He knew fear again...

Some one creeping about stealthily in the night...

He listened - but the sound was not repeated.

And now a new temptation assailed him. He wanted, desperately, to go out and
investigate. If he could only see who it was prowling about in the darkness.

But to open his door would be the action of a fool. Very likely that was exactly
what the other was waiting for. He might even have meant Blore to hear what he
had heard, counting on him coming out to investigate.

Blore stood rigid - listening. He could hear sounds everywhere now, cracks,
rustles, mysterious whispers - but his dogged realistic brain knew them for what
they were - the creations of his own heated imagination.



And then suddenly he heard something that was not imagination. Footsteps, very
soft, very cautious, but plainly audible to a man listening with all his ears as
Blore was listening.

They came softly along the corridor (both Lombard's and Armstrong's rooms were
farther from the stair-head than his). They passed his door without hesitating or
faltering.

And as they did so, Blore made up his mind.

He meant to see who it was! The footsteps had definitely passed his door going to
the stairs. Where was the man going?

When Blore acted, he acted quickly, surprisingly so for a man who looked so
heavy and slow. He tiptoed back to the bed, slipped matches into his pocket,
detached the plug of the electric lamp by his bed, and picked it up winding the
flex round it. It was a chromium affair with a heavy ebonite base - a useful
weapon.

He sprinted noiselessly across the room, removed the chair from under the door
handle and with precaution unlocked and unbolted the door. He stepped out into
the corridor. There was a faint sound in the hall below; Blore ran noiselessly in
his stockinged feet to the head of the stairs.

At that moment he realized why it was he had heard all these sounds so clearly.
The wind had died down completely and the sky must have cleared. There was
faint moonlight coming in through the landing window and it illuminated the
hall below.



Blore had an instantaneous glimpse of a figure just passing out through the front
door.

In the act of running down the stairs in pursuit, he paused.

Once again, he had nearly made a fool of himself! This was a trap, perhaps, to
lure him out of the house!

But what the other man didn't realize was that he had made a mistake, had
delivered himself neatly into Blore's hands.

For, of the three tenanted rooms upstairs, one must now be empty. All that had
to be done was to ascertain which!

Blore went swiftly back along the corridor.

He paused first at Dr. Armstrong's door and tapped. There was no answer.

He waited a minute, then went on to Philip Lombard's room.

Here the answer came at once.



""Who's there?""

""It's Blore. I don't think Armstrong is in his room. Wait a minute.""

He went on to the door at the end of the corridor. Here he tapped again.

""Miss Claythorne. Miss Claythorne.""

Vera's voice, startled, answered him:



""Who is it? What's the matter?""

""It's all right, Miss Claythorne. Wait a minute. I'll come back.""

He raced back to Lombard's room. The door opened as he did so. Lombard stood
there. He held a candle in his left hand. He had pulled on his trousers over his
pyjamas. His right hand rested in the pocket of his pyjama jacket. He said
sharply:

""What the hell's all this?""

Blore explained rapidly. Lombard's eyes lit up.

""Armstrong - eh? So he's our pigeon!"" He moved along to Armstrong's door.
""Sorry, Blore, but I don't take anything on trust.""

He rapped sharply on the panel.

""Armstrong - Armstrong.""

There was no answer.

Lombard dropped to his knees and peered through the key-hole. He inserted his
little finger gingerly into the lock.

He said:



Key's not in the door on the inside.""



Blore said:



""That means he locked it on the outside and took it with him.""

Philip nodded:

""Ordinary precaution to take. We'll get him, Blore... This time, we'll get him! Half
a second.""

He raced along to Vera's room.



'Vera.""



""Yes.



""We're hunting Armstrong. He's out of his room. Whatever you do, don't open
your door. Understand?""

""Yes, I understand.""

""If Armstrong comes along and says that I've been killed, or Blore's been killed,
pay no attention. See? Only open your door if both Blore and I speak to you. Got
that?""

Vera said:



Yes. I'm not a complete fool.""



Lombard said:



'Good.



He joined Blore. He said:

""And now - after him! The hunt's up!""

Blore said:

""We'd better be careful. He's got a revolver, remember.""

Philip Lombard raced down the stairs chuckling.

He said:



""That's where you're wrong."" He undid the front door, remarking: ""Latch pushed
back - so that he could get in again easily.""

He went on:

""I've got that revolver!"" He took it half out of his pocket as he spoke. ""Found it
put back in my drawer tonight.""

Blore stopped dead on the doorstep. His face changed. Philip Lombard saw it.

He said impatiently:

""Don't be a damned fool, Blore! I'm not going to shoot you! Go back and barricade
yourself in if you like! I'm off after Armstrong.""

He started off into the moonlight. Blore, after a minute's hesitation, followed
him.

He thought to himself:



""I suppose I'm asking for it. But after all -""

After all he had tackled criminals armed with revolvers before now. Whatever
else he lacked, Blore did not lack courage. Show him the danger and he would
tackle it pluckily. He was not afraid of danger in the open, only of danger
undefined and tinged with the supernatural.



VI



Vera, left to wait results, got up and dressed.

She glanced over once or twice at the door. It was a good solid door. It was both
bolted and locked and had an oak chair wedged under the handle.

It could not be broken open by force. Certainly not by Dr. Armstrong. He was not
a physically powerful man.

If she were Armstrong intent on murder, it was cunning that she would employ,
not force.

She amused herself by reflecting on the means he might employ.

He might, as Philip had suggested, announce that one of the other two men was
dead. Or he might possibly pretend to be mortally wounded himself, might drag
himself groaning to her door.

There were other possibilities. He might inform her that the house was on fire.
More, he might actually set the house on fire... Yes, that would be a possibility.
Lure the other two men out of the house, then, having previously laid a trail of



petrol, he might set light to it. And she, like an idiot, would remain barricaded in
her room until it was too late.

She crossed over to the window. Not too bad. At a pinch one could escape that
way. It would mean a drop - but there was a handy flower-bed.

She sat down and picking up her diary began to write in it in a clear flowing
hand.

One must pass the time.

Suddenly she stiffened to attention. She had heard a sound. It was, she thought,
a sound like breaking glass. And it came from somewhere downstairs.

She listened hard, but the sound was not repeated.

She heard, or thought she heard, stealthy sounds of footsteps, the creak of stairs,
the rustle of garments - but there was nothing definite, and she concluded, as
Blore had done earlier, that such sounds had their origin in her own imagination.

But presently she heard sounds of a more concrete nature.

People moving about downstairs - the murmur of voices. Then the very decided
sound of some one mounting the stairs - doors opening and shutting - feet going
up to the attics overhead. More noises from there.

Finally the steps came along the passage. Lombard's voice said:

""Vera? You all right?""

""Yes. What's happened?""



Blore's voice said:

""Will you let us in?""

Vera went to the door. She removed the chair, unlocked the door and slid back
the bolt. She opened the door. The two men were breathing hard, their feet and
the bottom of their trousers were soaking wet.

She said again:

""What's happened?""



Lombard said:



""Armstrong's disappeared...""



VII



Vera cried:



""What?""



Lombard said:



""Vanished clean off the island.""



Blore concurred:



""Vanished - that's the word! Like some damned conjuring trick.""



Vera said impatiently:

""Nonsense! He's hiding somewhere!""

Blore said:

""No, he isn't! I tell you, there's nowhere to hide on this island. It's as bare as your
hand! There's moonlight outside. As clear as day it is. And he s not to be found.""

Vera said:

""He doubled back into the house.""

Blore said:

""We thought of that. We've searched the house too. You must have heard us. He's
not here, I tell you. He's gone - clean vanished, vamoosed...""

Vera said incredulously:



""I don't believe it.""
Lombard said:
""It's true, my dear.""
He paused and then said:

smashed - and there are only three little Indian boys on the table.""",Agatha Christie,1980,"[95, 82, 62, 53, 29, 29, 31, 33, 36, 40, 51, 64, 75, 88]",14

If you smell like you been at work all day and your car
Please ""put your hands down""
Now look up at the pinky fingers that are still in the air
If you see him ashy around the knuckles
Like the nigga wash half of his hands
And lotion three quarters of his body
Please say ""put your hands down""
If your spinnin' rims spin counter clockwise, you are not pimpin'
If you are dancin' on the dancefloor
And you look to your left and your right
And you do not see a woman in sight
Guess what? You guessed it - you are not pimpin
If your Vodka and Cranberry is really really dark like blood
That's because you didn't order Vodka buddy
That's why it's three dollars a glass
""Put your hands down""
Now look down, look down
I need everybody to pull up your pants leg one time
Okay, you see the nigga with the white socks

147,No Night So Long,"An old friend told me that you just ran out of chances
One too many dances down the narrow street of time
Remember how we faced the world, like two tramps shining
Please, don't let that magic ever end
Don't forget what we learned living on the wind
No night so long that you can't find the day;
No day so wrong that you can't find your way;
Call on me like you used to do
I still can show you who you are
That day the long and dusty road had us both crying
We used up our last joke just to try to smile a again
And only now I find I know what we were learning
Though it's dark and you have traveled far
Ev'ry long night gives you one bright shining star
No night so long that you can't find the day;
No day so wrong that you can't find your way;
Call on me like you used to do
I can still show you who you are
Deep in the night you know that you'll find

A gypsy wind is blowin' warm tonight
The sky is starlit and the time is right
And still you're tellin' me you have to go
Before you leave there's something you should know
Yeah something you should know babe
I've seen you smilin' in the summer sun
I've seen your long hair flying when you run
I've made my mind up that it's meant to be
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me

[Chorus]
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Out where the rivers meet the soundin' sea
You're high above me now, you're wild and free
Ah but someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me

[Verse 2]
Some people say that love's a losin' game
You start with fire but you lose the flame
The ashes smolder but the warmth's soon gone
You end up cold and lonely on your own
I'll take my chances babe, I'll risk it all
I'll win your love or I'll take the fall
I've made my mind up girl it's meant to be
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me

[Chorus]
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
It's written down somewhere, it's got to be
You're high above me flyin' wild and free
Oh but someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me
Someday lady you'll accomp'ny me

I feel it in my soul, it's meant to be

149,Don't Ask Me Why,"[Verse 1]
One hundred years ago in a little town in Minnesota
Lived a boy who called himself McGill
He sat by the windowsill
And dreamed until the day went still
And in the dark, he'd dream a little more
And then, one day, there came along
A girl who sang a pretty song
With a freckled face, she called herself Marie
She said, ""Hey 'Gill you wouldn't believe
What lies out there beyond those trees --
Would you let me take you out to see?

[Chorus 1]
So pack up your bags and fly
You've got some living before you die
I've got this feeling, don't ask me why
Don't ask me why, don't ask me why

[Verse 2]
So Marie and 'Gill, they took to the hills
And climbed a hundred miles until
They found a spot where they could be at ease
It was the highest point that they could see
Rose far above the tallest trees
So naturally, they became king and queen
But before they'd laid their regal grounds
The sky had darkened all around
The heavens broke, and rain began to fall
The lightning cracked, the thunder clapped
And soon the king and queen were trapped
On an island sinking in the rising flood
Well poor Marie, she said, ""The end's begun!
I've always had a place to run
I'm certain that this night will be our last.""
But 'Gill said, ""Marie, well you wouldn't believe
What lies inside of you and me --
Take my hand and we can be at peace.""

[Chorus 2]
So lay down and close your eyes
You've got some dreaming before you die
I got this feeling, don't ask me why
Don't ask me why, don't ask me why
Lay down and close your eyes
You've got some dreaming before you die
I've got this feeling, don't ask me why
Don't ask me why, don't ask me why

[Bridge]
I promise you this too shall pass
Even if this night is our last
I promise you this too shall pass
Even if this night is our last
I'm afraid that I've made a mistake choosing to stay
(I promise you this too shall pass
Even if this night is our last)
I'm afraid that I've made a mistake choosing to stay
(I promise you this too shall pass
Even if this night is our last)

[Verse 3]
For forty hours the storm raged on
And Gill, he said, ""I had it wrong --
If we don't leave we're surely gonna die.""
But sweet Marie, she said, ""I see the light --
My dear McGill, you had it right
We just needed a little faith before we fly!
Because I've dreamed of what this world could be
In all its possibility
And I'll be damned if I don't get to see
So take my hand and hold it tight
We're gonna make it out alright
Jump with me and promise to believe.""

[Chorus 3]
Oh, pack up your bags and fly
We've got some dreaming before we die
We've got this feeling, don't ask us why
Don't ask us why, don't ask us why

[Outro]
Pack up your bags and fly
We've got some dreaming before we die

150,One In A Million You,"Love had played its games on me so long
I started to believe I'd never find anyone
Doubt had tried to convince me to give in, said, ""You can't win""
But one day the sun came a shinin' through
The rain had stopped and the skies were blue
And oh, what a revelation to see
Someone was saying ""I love you"" to me

A one in a million chance of a lifetime
And life showed compassion
And sent to me a stroke of love called ""You""
A one in a million you

I was a lonely man with empty arms to fill
Then I found a piece of happiness to call my own
And life is worth livin' again
For to love you, to me, is to live

A one in a million chance of a lifetime
And life showed compassion
And sent to me a stroke of love called ""You""

152,Someone That I Used To Love,"When I wake up each morning
Trying to find myself
And if I'm ever the least unsure
I always remind myself

Though you're someone in this world
That I'll always choose to love
From now on you're only someone
That I used to love

As for me, it's getting down
To the last unspoken part
Where you must begin
To ease the pain of a broken heart

Tell me why should I even care
If I have to lose your love
From now on
You're only someone that I used to love

Wish it was enough for you
All the love I had to give
And I did my best to keep you satisfied
I guess you'll never know
How much I tried
I really tried

And if ever our paths should cross again
Well, you won't find me
Being the one to get lost again

Once, I had so much to give
That you just refused my love
From now on
You're only someone that I used to love

And I did my best to keep you satisfied
I guess you'll never know
How much I tried
I really tried

When I wake each morning
Trying to find myself
And if I'm ever the least unsure
I always remind myself

Though you're someone in this world
That I'll always choose to love

You're only someone that I used to love

The things we said late last night

And you were so afraid that I'd found someone new
But darlin well, there's no need
For what we're going through because

You and I've been in love too long
To worry about tomorrow
Here's a place where we both belong
I know you're the only woman that I'm dreaming of
You're the only woman that I really love

Baby see what a foolish heart has done for me
Darling why would you break my heart and make me cry
Well now you can't go back and change the way things are
And all this foolish talk won't take us very far
And so I hope you're listening cause I'm telling you
About the way I feel and what I'm going through because

I say you're the only woman that I really love

When the pain of love surrounds you
And the world may be unkind
I'll put my loving arms around you
And take you far from this place and time because
You and I've been in love too long

Just before our love got lost you said
""I am as constant as a northern star""
And I said, ""Constantly in the darkness
Where's that at?
If you want me I'll be in the bar""
On the back of a cartoon coaster
In the blue TV screen light
I drew a map of Canada
Oh, Canada
With your face sketched on it twice

Oh, you are in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling
And I would still be on my feet
Oh, I would still be on my feet

[Verse 2]
Oh, I am a lonely painter
I live in a box of paints
I'm frightened by the devil
And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid
I remember that time you told me, you said
""Love is touching souls""
Surely you touched mine
'Cause part of you pours out of me
In these lines from time to time

[Chorus]
Oh, you are in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling
Still I'd be on my feet
I would still be on my feet

[Verse 3]
I met a woman
She had a mouth like yours
She knew your life
She knew your devils and your deeds
And she said
""Go to him, stay with him if you can
But be prepared to bleed""

Oh, but you are in my blood, you are my holy wine
You're so bitter, bitter and so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling

And you never can catch it up
So I'm hanging on to you as though eternity beckoned

Common sense 'd tell me not to try 'n continue
But I'm after a piece of that diamond in you
So keep an eye open
My spirit ain't broken
Your love's so incredible
Your body so edible
You give me an overdose of love
Just a little is a enough

I'm connoisseur of champagne cognac
The perfume nearly beats the taste
I eat an oyster and I feel the contact
But more than one would be a waste
Some people want an endless line that's true
But all I have is a little time with you
A smile sets me reeling
A kiss feels like stealing
Your love is like heroin
This addict is mellowing
I can't pretend that I'm tough
Just a little is enough

Just like a sailor heading into the seas
There's a gale blowing in my face
The high winds scare me but I need the breeze
And I can't head for any other place
Life would seem so easy on the other tack
But even a hurricane won't turn me back
You might be an island
On the distant horizon
But the little I see
Looks like heaven to me
I don't care if the ocean gets rough
Just a little is enough

Common sense 'd tell me not to try and continue
But I'm after a piece of that diamond in you

Of innocence again

Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Believe me

Sailing
Takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
Soon I will be free

Fantasy
It gets the best of me
When I'm sailing

All caught up in the reverie
Every word is a symphony
Won't you believe me?

Sailing
Takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
And soon I will be free

Well, it's not far back to sanity
At least it's not for me
And if the wind is right you can sail away
And find serenity

Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Really, believe me

Takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me

162,My Prayer,"[Intro]
When the twilight is gone
And no songbirds are singing
When the twilight is gone
You come into my heart
And here in my heart you will stay
While I pray

[Verse 1]
My prayer
Is to linger with you
At the end of the day
In a dream that's divine

[Verse 2]
My prayer
Is a rapture in blue
With the world far away
And your lips close to mine

[Bridge]
Tonight
While our hearts are aglow
Oh tell me the words
That I'm longing to know

[Verse 3]
My prayer
And the answer you give
May they still be the same
For as long as we live
That you'll always be there
At the end of my prayer",The Platters,1980,"[85, 65, 51, 47, 47, 53, 59, 64, 72, 83]",10
163,Turn It On Again,"(One, two, three, four!)

All I need is a TV show, that and the radio
Down on my luck again, down on my luck again
I can show you, I can show you some of the people in my life
I can show you, I can show you some of the people in my life
It's driving me mad, just another way of passing the day
I, I get so lonely when she's not there
I, I, I, I...

You're just another face that I know from the TV show
I have known you for so very long, I feel you like a friend
Can't you do anything for me, can I touch you for a while
Can I meet you another day and we will fly away

I can show you I can show you some of the people in my life
I can show you I can show you some of the people in my life
It's driving me mad it's just another way of passing the day
I, I get so lonely when she's not there
I, I, I...

Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again

167,Take Your Time (Do It Right) Part 1,"Recently a ladyfriend and I found ourselves in a late-night Mardi Gras game of Kings Cup with a swinger straight married couple, two of us drinking from 2-foot Jester-shaped daiquiris.  I know, I know: how could a night like that NOT end well?

Two days later, I found myself alone with the husband while ladyfriend and the wife were in the bathroom.  As soon as they walked away, he'd turned to me and said, ""So, I think you should give me some tips.""

""Tips on what?"" I replied.

""On how to do whatever it is you did to make her scream like that the other night.""  Ladyfriend had, indeed, had a pleasant response to my overtures.  But nothing unusual.  Uneventful, even.  I was drunk, with something of an audience... I wasn't at my best.  Then I thought ""this poor boy!"" and I decided to explain a little bit about cunnilingus for the poor gents out there who don't have their own vagina to use as a reference.

Then I thought I'd make it a game - see how much boys really want to know (1) how to make a girl shake with and electrocution of orgasm and (2) how girls *really* are when they're getting it on with other girls.

And, thanks to Rap Genius, I can illustrate and share.  I'll answer (1) here in this album - new chapters posting regularly.  I'll answer (2) if I know people are interested, which I'll know if I sell more than 20,000 copies of my novel (links upon click), in which I begin to describe it.

How to Eat a Pussy Right

I’m gonna start with a preview: exhale through your mouth whenever you can remember to, but don’t pant.  See, I’m giving you details.  More to come.  But first, some background, and a word of caution:  you gotta like pussy to eat it right.  If the thought of going down on a woman grosses you out, consider sucking a dick.

A. Part 1: Know Her Anatomy

The first thing to understand is that there's more than one answer to this question, “Bacchus, how do I eat  pussy right?” and it's _your_ job to find the right answer (hang onto your boner, I'm gonna tell you how you go about it).

Every pussy is different, on the whole. Click on that explanation, spend some time looking at the sculptures.  Notice the diversity, the range. Some labia cascade out of the vagina cavity like dams bursting; some clits stay nuzzled totally inside along with the labia while she’s at rest.  Most will change in appearance somewhat when they get aroused.

In men and women alike, some portion of the genitalia is internal.  How much is internal depends on the person.  Almost no women get the most achievable pleasure from a laser focus on a small area of the clitoris, even the classic and horrid rapid-fire poke some of you poor bastards attempt.  Usually, a greater contact area that could include the folds around the clitoris, the inner and outer labia, the bridge to the ass, and the inside of the vagina is ideal.  Yes, some of your tongues can get there, up in that vagina, all the way to the (sometimes) g-spot.  Most tongues are bigger than Ken Jeong’s penis, and much more nimble.  But not all women want you to go there, remember that.

Every clitoris is different, too.  Some stick out more, others curl back heavily toward the vaginal wall on the opposite end.  Some get more engorged than others.  HOWEVER, if you notice NO swelling in the clitoris or the vagina as a whole while you are performing cunnilingus, YOU KNOW YOU ARE DOING A SHIT JOB.  I’ve never seen one that didn’t swell just a little when it was happy.  I’ll talk about what to do if you realize you’re doing a shit job later.

Don’t confuse the clitoris with the inner labia, please.  Yes, they’re connected, and when the inner labia are about as thick as the clitoris you can expect that a woman will feel pleasure if you lick them, especially at the intersection point of clitoris/inner labia.  You’re probably going to get more results by identifying the scope of the clitoris and training your efforts there, however and attention to the clitoris should be, even if non-exclusive, more of a priority than tinkering with the inner labia.  The clitoris will probably be the part that swells the most, and will probably be the most sensitive part.  I’ve circled the clitoris and inner labia in different colors in a number of different pussies here.  Note that you can’t always see them.  Some folds gotta be pulled back.  Try get an idea of what to expect, won’t you?

If a woman doesn’t shave/wax, you probably can’t do much with the outer labia.  If she does shave, an occasional tangent in that direction might be beneficial - or totally unwelcome.  After you understand how to use your tongue properly (See Part 3), try such a tangent out and see how it goes. I’ve circled the outer labia in a number of different pussies here to show you what they might look like.

In fact, the first thing you should do as you make your way down on a new woman (and, for the love of the gods, take your time getting there and show some love to the nipples/hips/thighs/etc. on the way) is get to know her in a sense more biblical than the biblical.

If you don’t know where to begin, think of her body as a dartboard with the clitoris at the center and her mouth at the upper edge, with about a million rings of scoring in between.  You want your mouth to kiss along the edge of the dartboard in an inward spiral until you get to the bullseye, and then you just keep on kissing.  We’ll talk about how to vary your intensity later.

This process is really about getting to know this particular woman, and if you’re in a rush, you should save it for when you have more time.  Once you know the woman, you can skip the outer rings or start with intense stroke.  But you’ll never do a good job if you don’t know this particular pussy well enough to please it, and it takes some time to get there.  it’s worth taking the time to figure out what works for this lady first.

So, YOUR KISSING MOUTH SHOULD START SOFT.  As you make your way as far around the dartboard spiral as you can on her body, try slightly harder strokes of the tongue, harder kisses, a little sucking.  She may show pleasure by moaning or crying out or purring or simply with a tensing of the muscles.  Pay attention to what she responds to positively, and, more importantly, if she responds to any level of pressure or particular action negatively.  If she does respond to something negatively, eliminate it from your repertoire immediately, and note what it was about her reaction that seemed negative so you can be sensitive to it going forward.

As you follow the spiral down, make the concentric circles progressively smaller, but keep thinking like you’re kissing her mouth.  In fact, you should try to make the last concentric circle with one unified, even-paced circle of the tongue that maps the border of the clitoris as it falls into the body.  Let your tongue slide here; it’s one of the only times pointing it works well, and the pointed end should travel the circle around her clit so that it touches only the edge of the inner labia.  Congratulations, you’ve found the clitoris.  I hope you took some mental notes on what parts of her were also responsive on the way there.  You’ll need those notes for Part 2, to follow, and don’t forget to check out the book here (free preview here on Rap Genius).

Всего 5 минут спустя
Видишь, камни кружат танго прямо на моих костях
Тот медовый, что крутил я, 5 минут уж как иссяк
И потому слюнявлю новый на маршруте в особняк
И твой стиль звал меня ""Папа"", но я не кончаю внутрь
Моя мама говорила: ""Суки поголовно врут""
Раскопай сам себе яму, ведь у нищих нету слуг
И не прошло пяти минут, как я зароллил

Прячу бронхи в дипломат

Те, кто диссят нас в инете, заходили ровно 5 минут назад
Прикупил вина в РосАле, прыгнул в свой Uber Passat
Смокал сигу у King Bong'а ровно 5 минут назад
Сплю с открытыми глазами, со мной лали с классной попкой
Беру трубку, там WhatsApp — ни гудка, дежавю
Это было ровно 5 минут назад
В Telegram приходит суть, в телефоне — шелуха
Ты хотел делать клауд, но я делал ровно 5 минут назад
Я ничего не придумал, так и есть, такой расклад
Ты хотел услышать свежесть, но тупил и не признал
И я молчу про твой стафф
Это было словно сотню лет назад
Каждый раз на волне, но спустя года два
Год в игре и пищишь, что ты swag, словно plug

Yea man here comes another CD
Another opportunity for you to see me
With the knack for rhymes, when I start crafting lines
And I get on the mic I have to shine
Like yea, spitting verses like there's no tomorrow
Pick up a pen anytime my mind shows some sorrow
Remain open minded, at times got broken wires
All screwed up dawg, but I ain't chokin' I am
Feeling more on fire, then i've ever felt
Improving and moving everyday for a better self
It's me write, rhymes, produce, and pick beats
I don't need any human being to fix me
Any opportunity I get man i'm taking it
Forget fakin' it, i'm waitin' wit, a smile til i'm makin' it
Putting my all in elegant rhymes
Constructing every track with a clever design yo

Single songs then came the Elevate EP
People try to cheat me I accelerate easy
So nice try, whatever if you don't like my
Work I just sit with a smirk and write rhymes
Flow like liquid, yeah man close to water
Make music, some will hope for more of
This stuff, got my booth all fixed up
And what I write is never rushed quick stuff
But it's, damn right mysterious man I can fight
But I'd rather give strength and vent when my hands write
So at least, when I spit over a rap beat
I can vent, and at the same time give people mad strength
Cuz at times we all feel down and need strength
When you feel your life's gone, right off the deep end
I'm here for you let me make it clear to you
Quitting ain't something that i'm prepared to do yo

You called my house, no later than yesterday
'Cause I picked up the extension, and I heard every word you said
Now, why don't you just go on, man, and leave my little girl alone
Lord, before I get evil, man, and I'm known to do something wrong
You better leave her alone, now

You call my house, all the hours of the night

But these here breaks will rock your shoes
And these are the breaks
Break it up, break it up, break it up!

If your woman steps out with another man
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks)
And she runs off with him to Japan
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks)
And the IRS says they want to chat
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks)

You don't stop
Keep on, somebody scream!

That's hot, let me hear it back

She was a bad girl, he was a good boy
She played with fire while he played inside the ring
She gets so selfish and he was selfless
He played by books, she never liked to play it safe

But he fell in love with her fucked up ways
With her drunken days, yeah, he still stayed
Yeah, he fell in love with her twisted dreams

She numbed herself so she would never feel a thing

What's the matter with the clothes I'm wearing?
Can't you tell that your tie's too wide?
Maybe I should buy some old tab collars?
Welcome back to the age of jive
Where have you been hidin' out lately, honey?
You can't dress trashy till you spend a lot of money

[Chorus 1]
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me

[Verse 2]
What's the matter with the car I'm driving?
Can't you tell that it's out of style?
Should I get a set of white wall tires?
Are you gonna cruise the miracle mile?
Nowadays you can't be too sentimental
Your best bet's a true baby blue Continental

[Chorus 2]
Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk
It's still rock and roll to me

[Verse 3]
Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers
Cause it's always been the same old scene
There's a new band in town
But you can't get the sound from a story in a magazine...
Aimed at your average teen

[Verse 4]
How about a pair of pink sidewinders
And a bright orange pair of pants?
You could really be a Beau Brummel baby
If you just give it half a chance
Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers
You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers

[Chorus 3]
Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me

[Verse 5]
What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing?
Don't you know that they're out of touch?
Should I try to be a straight 'A' student?
If you are then you think too much
Don't you know about the new fashion honey?
All you need are looks and a whole lotta money

180,How Does It Feel To Be Back,"Please return, come back, I've been saving your place
Too much time has elapsed, unreality, memory erases
And the rules and the rights and the wrongs don't apply
Far apart, so together is destiny weeded to fate

I write the script, you direct my dreams
We're along on the beach for the passionate scene
And it's a drag to wake up with you, saying to me

How does it feel to be back?
How does it feel to be back?
How does it feel to be back in my arms again?

I'm bored and alone and it's weakening me
One night out and I'm looking for trouble and finding it's easy
You know we all make mistakes and we all need the touch of a hand
In the right kind of place, in a time of need

I could pick up the phone, but the talk ain't cheap
I pick up on the thoughts that you're sending to me
And I wait for the day I hear you saying to me

I say baby, how does it feel to be back?
How does it feel to be back?
How does it feel to be back in my arms again?
How does it feel to be back in my arms again?

And in my dreams I hear you saying to me
Say baby, how does it feel to be back?
How does it feel to be back?
How does it feel to be back in my arms again?

Wishing I could do this on my own, but I can't
I'm feeling like my soul's migrated
Down the cold to where the birds are marching, feathers come together, fly away

You're taking every piece of me
I never tried to stop you so I shouldn't, all the blame
As I lay here mutilated
Lost in memory, the rest of me will live to see the day they curse your name

And it's not my style, just sit and wallow
But I'm six feet deeper than I've ever been
Lost in a dream, caught in between

Yeah we may be down and out
But we're still breathing
Yeah we may be down and out
We're just bleeding

I'm caught up in this latest rapture
I'm starting back at zero and I don't want to begin

To the part of me that needs the most stability and now we're caving in

If your heart slips away
I'll wonder what its all about

And it's first time love, giving you fever
Second time love, cooling your brow
Finally love takes your hand in the dark
And leads you home somehow

So never say never another
Just because somebody broke your heart
Get your chin off the floor
You'll never know what's in store
If you don't give love a chance to start
And if you don't believe in following feelings

It's never too late to start
Cause when you open your eyes
Then you'll realize
I'm the one who's chasing your heart

Well it's first time love, giving you fever
Second time love, cooling your brow
Finally love takes your hand in the dark
And leads you home somehow

And it's first time love making your heart beat
Second time love making it stop
Finally love picks you up from the bottom

196,Tulsa Time/Cocaine,"Paramilitary drug raids have been growing in number for 25 years. As they’ve become more frequent, so too have incidents in which these raids have gone wrong. Criminologist Peter Kraska says his research shows that between 1989 and 2001, at least 780 cases of flawed paramilitary raids reached the appellate level, a dramatic increase over the 1980s, where such cases were rare, or earlier, when they were practically nonexistent.280 Yet despite the ongoing reporting of botched raids in media outlets, the phenomenon is still consistently dismissed by supporters of paramilitary policing as a series of “isolated incidents.” The truth is, mistaken raids continue to happen with disturbing regularity. They can’t all be isolated incidents. This section will catalogue an extensive list of botched raids between 1995 and April 2006 found over the course of several months of research. It is by no means comprehensive. The Cato Institute has also plotted an expanded list of cases on an interactive map, which can be found at http://www.cato.org /raidmap. The aim of this section is to demonstrate that botched paramilitary drug raids—and the death, injury, and terrorizing of innocents that come with them—aren’t merely a regrettable, infrequent consequence of an otherwise effective police tactic. Rather, they’re the inevitable consequence of a flawed, overbearing, and unnecessary form of drug policing. Wrong Address The botched drug raids that seem to generate the most public outrage are those in which police force entry into a home that turns out to be the wrong address. It’s bad enough to have a system in place that is needlessly violent and provocative for known or suspected drug offenders. But it’s particularly frustrating to see wholly innocent people terrorized, injured, and killed because police, policymakers, and judges cling to a flawed policy.281 No case better illustrates the preventable, tragic consequences of this flawed system than the death of Alberta Spruill. Alberta Spruill.On May 16, 2003, a dozen New York City police officers stormed an apartment building in Harlem on a no-knock warrant. They were acting on a tip from a confidential informant who told them a convicted felon was dealing drugs and guns from the sixth floor. There was no felon. The only resi-dent in the building was Alberta Spruill, described by friends as a “devout churchgoer.”282 Before entering, police deployed a flashbang grenade. The blinding, deafening explosion stunned the 57-year-old city worker. As the officers realized their mistake and helped Spruill to her feet, the woman slipped into cardiac arrest. She died two hours later. A police investigation would later find that the drug dealer the raid team was looking for had been arrested days earlier and was still in police custody. He couldn’t possibly have been at Spruill’s apartment. The officers who conducted the raid did no investigation whatsoever to corroborate the informant’s tip.283 Worse, a police source later told the New York Daily News that the informant had offered police tips on several occasions, none of which had led to an arrest. His record was so poor, in fact, that he was due to be dropped from the city’s informant list.284 Nevertheless, police took his tip on the excon in Spruill’s building to the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which approved the application for a no-knock entry. A judge then issued the warrant resulting in Spruill’s death. The entire process took only a matter of hours. After the Spruill case, the media began to take notice of other victims of botched noknocks, including the following three cases in the fall of 2002, about six months before the raid that killed Spruill.

• Williemae Mack. On September 3, 2002, police broke down the door of Brooklyn resident Williemae Mack in a pre-dawn drug raid. Her twin 13-yearold sons were asleep at the time. One, frightened by the noise and the explosive device police used to gain entry, hid under the bed. Police pulled him out and put a gun to his head. Police then handcuffed both boys at gunpoint. They found no drugs. They had raided the wrong address.285

• Robert and Marie Rogers.On October 15, 2002, about 20 police armed with pistols and shotguns served a no-knock warrant on the home of retired police officer Robert Rogers and his wife Marie. The two were watching television when the officers stormed their home in Queens. Mr. Rogers initially grabbed his handgun, believing the police to be intruders. Once he recognized they were law enforcement, he dropped his weapon and covered it with his body. Rogers later told Newsday that had the raiding officers seen his gun, “I’d be dead.” Again, the police had the wrong address.286Marie Rogers would take the news of Alberta Spruill’s death especially hard. “When I heard about what happened to this woman, I broke down and cried,” Rogers later told the New York Post, “You would have thought that I knew her. Then I was angry.”287

• Michael Thompson. A day before the raid on the Rogerses, police also burst into the home of Michael Thompson, also of Queens. That raid left the man’s large mahogany front door broken into pieces. The police then trained their guns on Thompson’s chest while they searched his home and the upstairs apartment of a tenant for drugs. Once again, they had raided the wrong address.288 The victims of the above three raids were represented in civil suits filed by Norman Siegel, former director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. Mr. Siegel told the New York Times in the fall of 2003 that according to police data, police were conducting about 460 such searches of private residences each month, with the vast majority of those served under no-knock warrants.289 In fact, just days after the raid on the Rogerses’ home, Siegel held a press conference and pled with police to end the practice of no-knock raids. Nearly predicting the Spruill raid that would happen a year later, Siegel warned: “We must do a better job of no-knock search warrants. Otherwise, someone might wind up dead as a result of how we implement this procedure.”290

• Timothy Brockman.Just two days before the Spruill raid, police from NYPD and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms displayed extraordinary ineptitude in executing another botched no-knock raid, this time on the home of former Marine Timothy Brockman. Acting on a tip from a confused anonymous informant, police stormed the public housing apartment of the 61-year-old Brockman, who used a walker to get around. Police deployed a flashbang grenade, setting Brockman’s carpet on fire, then handcuffed the man and threw him to the floor while they searched his home for drugs. They had the wrong address. Brockman would later be cleared of all charges.291 The Brockman case is another illustration of how the mishmash of court precedents governing the use of no-knock raids can lead to errors. In Brockman’s case, New York police wanted to raid the apartment on the basis of the testimony of a single informant who had visited the targeted residence on just one occasion. State law required more evidence for a no-knock warrant. Federal law, however, is more deferential to police and, in this case, allowed for a no-knock entry. New York investigators merely called the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, who sent an agent from Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms along for the raid. The Brockman raid was now a federal case, governed by federal guidelines. Miscommunication between local and federal police led to series of errors that caused the police to mistakenly break down Brockman’s door. Though a potentially grave and inexcusable error on the part of federal and local police, the Brockman case was ignored by the media and treated with indifference by the police. As the Times writes, “At the time, the incident received no publicity and no serious attention from the police leadership.”292 In a follow-up piece published months after Spruill’s death, the Village Voicereported that complaints about police abuses with respect to no-knocks had been pouring in for years. “Until Spruill’s death, the NYPD had done nothing to stem the number of incidents,” the Voice wrote, “despite receiving a memo from the Citizen Complaint Review Board in January noting the high number of raid complaints. Last March, the NAACP also approached NYPD commissioner Raymond W. Kelly about the raids.”293 Indeed, the New York Times ran a story back in 1998, a full five years before Spruill’s death, headlined, “As Number of Police Raids Increase, So Do Questions.”294 The paper noted that the number of narcotics search warrants issued in New York City doubled from 1,447 in 1994 to 2,977 in 1998. Most of these, according to the Times, were no-knock warrants.295 The Times also profiled several cases of botched no knocks from the late 1990s. Among them were the following:

• Mary and Cornelius Jefferson. The article began with a description of a botched no-knock on the home of Cornelius and Mary Jefferson, a couple in their 60s, in which police used a battering ram to obliterate the front door of an apartment “where plastic slipcovers protect the sofas and diplomas and awards line the walls.” Cornelius told the Times, “I thought they were coming to rob us, coming to kill us.” They had the wrong address.296

• Ellis Elliott. On February 27, 1998, police conducted a no-knock raid on the Bronx home of Elliott, on the basis of information they later determined to be “miscommunication with an informant.” As police attempted to break down his door, Elliott feared he was being attacked and fired a shot through the door. Police responded with a barrage of 26 bullets, all of which miraculously missed Elliott. Elliott was then dragged out of his home, naked, allegedly peppered with racial epithets, then arrested on charges of possessing an unlicensed weapon. Police later admitted their error and paid $1,000 to have Elliott’s door repaired.297Elliott pled guilty to disorderly conduct for firing at the officers and was given a conditional discharge. No police officers were charged or disciplined for the error.298

• The Crown Heights Raid. On May 1, 1998, police broke down the door to a home in Brooklyn’s Crown Heights neighborhood in a no-knock raid that was based on the word of a single confidential informant. They expected to find a drug den. Instead, according to the Times, police found “a retired banker, a home health attendant, and their two daughters.” One of the daughters was mentally disabled, and was showering at the time of the raid. Police pulled her from the shower, handcuffed her, and despite her pleas to the officers that she was menstruating, refused to give her a sanitary pad until she began visibly bleeding.299

• Sandra Soto. On June 5, 1997, police carried out a no-knock warrant based on information from an anonymous informant in the East New York area of Brooklyn. The warrant instructed them to raid a gray door marked “2M.” Finding no such door, they simply broke down the nearest door, which was red and marked “2L.” They found a woman, Sandra Soto, and her two children—but no drugs.300

•Shaunsia Patterson. New York Times columnist Bob Herbert later reported that on the same dayas the raid on Ellis Elliott’s home, New York City police raided the Bronx apartment of Shaunsia Patterson and her two children, ages three and two. Patterson was eight months pregnant. Police first grabbed Patterson’s sister Misty, 15, who was also in the room, and threw her to the floor. They then confronted Patterson, who was sitting on her bed. One officer pushed Patterson onto her back. Another jumped on top of her. Patterson was eventually pushed to the floor and handcuffed while, in Patterson’s words, “one of the cops stepped on the side of my face and pressed my face into the floor.” When Patterson asked what the police wanted, she says, she was told to “shut the fuck up.” Police handcuffed Patterson while she wore only her underwear. Officers then screamed expletives at the two women while they scoured the apartment for drugs—demolishing the furniture, kitchen, and floor in the process. The raid so frightened Patterson, she urinated on herself. The police refused to allow her to change. Police also refused to show her a warrant. Hours later, an officer told her, “We got the wrong apartment,” and released her from her handcuffs. One confidential police source told New York Times columnist Bob Herbert, referring to the Patterson and Elliott raids, “Two in one day—that’s bad. But I’ll tell you what I honestly believe—I don’t think this happens that often.”301 Those kinds of assurances from police officials are common in New York and elsewhere. Despite repeated media reports of “wrong door” raids throughout the late 1990s, city officials continued to insist such incidents were uncommon—and nothing to be alarmed about. But in February 1998, the New York Police Department circulated a memo among the city’s police officers instructing them how to contact locksmiths and door repair services should they break down the door to the wrong address, suggesting that mistakes were in fact fairly common. 302 As discussed earlier, the review procedures New York City had in place to deal with police brutality failed as well. The Civilian Complaint Review Board, hamstrung by bureaucracy, limited jurisdiction, and squabbles with the police union, was helpless to effect any real change to stem the tide of “wrong door” warrants. New York had plenty of warnings that a case like Spruill’s might happen. The city’s public officials did little to heed them.

Just after Spruill’s death and ensuing media coverage, Manhattan Borough President C. Virginia Fields set up a hotline for victims of erroneous no-knock raids. For the first time, city officials encouraged victims of mistaken raids to come forward. The hotline received more than 100 calls in its first week of operation.303Fields’s staff followed up with many of those calls, and her office published a report detailing its findings. Among the cases included in that report are the following:

• Lewis Caldwell. On March 6, 2003, six police officers in riot gear broke down the door to the home of Lewis Caldwell. Police handcuffed Caldwell, a lung cancer patient, and forced him to the floor. Caldwell’s wife returned home from work to find her home filled with police officers and dogs. She pled with the officers to release her husband from the handcuffs. They kept him restrained for more than an hour. Caldwell says police were “laughing and joking” while searching his apartment. When the Caldwells filed a complaint, a lieutenant called to tell them the raid was justified, and “there’s nothing you can do about it.” No drugs were found, and no criminal charges were ever filed against either of the Caldwells.304

• Kim Stevenson. On April 9, 2003, about 20 police officers broke down the door of the West Harlem home of Kim Stevenson, asking “where the drugs were.” They handcuffed Stevenson and took her to another room, while other officers kept their weapons fixed on her 12-year-old daughter. Stevenson pled with police to explain why they were in her home, but they refused to answer her. A female officer took Stevenson into a bathroom to do a body search. After finding no drugs on her, the officers again handcuffed her while other officers finished searching her apartment. According to Stevenson, officers “made jokes and ridiculed” her during the search. When they left, they told her to “have management fix her door.” Her landlord refused. At the time the Fields report was published, Stevenson’s door had yet to be repaired. She was never charged with a crime.305

• Kim Yarbrough.On May 2, 2003, police broke into the Staten Island home of Kim Yarbrough, an employee at the city’s Department of Corrections. No one was home at the time, but Yarbrough’s son was told by his brother-in-law that “20 to 30” police had raided his mother’s home. When her son came to the house to investigate, he was handcuffed and thrown on the couch. Yarbrough came home from work with a supervisor to see that her door had been broken down and her home trashed. She and her son say police laughed and made jokes when she asked for names and badge numbers. Neither Yarbrough nor her son was ever charged with a crime.306

• Margarita Ortiz.On February 29, 2003, police broke into the home of Margarita Ortiz. Police handcuffed the woman and her 12-year-old son for two and a half hours while searching the apartment. After five hours of searching, police left without explanation. Ortiz says that the police knew “within 15 minutes” that her apartment had no drugs and that they never showed her their badges or provided a search warrant. At the time of the Fields report, Ortiz had been unable to get any information from the city regarding the raid on her home.307

• Sara Perez. On November 27, 2001, police broke into the Harlem home of. Sara Perez and put a shotgun to her head. They held her children and grandchildren at gunpoint, including onemonth-old twins. Police never showed Perez a search warrant, nor did they explain why they were in her home. Perez later learned that the raid was based on faulty information supplied by a 15-year old informant. After five months, the police department paid to repair her door.308

• Jeanine Jean. On May 7, 1998, police broke down the door and deployed a flashbang grenade in the home of Jeanine Jean. Frightened, Jean ran into a closet with her six-year-old son and called 911. Police pulled Jean from the closet, handcuffed her, then questioned her at gunpoint in front of her son. Jean, who had had surgery the day before, began bleeding when her surgical wound ruptured during the raid. After 90 minutes, police realized they had the wrong apartment and left without explanation. They left Jean’s door hanging from its hinges.309

• Atlee Swanson.On July 9, 1997, police conducted a 6 a.m. no-knock raid at the East Harlem home of Atlee Swanson. Police broke into Swanson’s home and demanded to know where “Joey, Jason, and Sean” were. Swanson said she knew no one by those names. The officers refused to show Swanson a search warrant, handcuffed her, and told her she faced 7 to 15 years in prison for selling drugs from her home. Police then put her in a holding cell for 31 hours. She returned home to find her apartment “trashed and vandalized.” Swanson got a copy of the search warrant in the mail three years later. Police had mistakenly entered the wrong apartment building.310 The following raids weren’t mentioned in the Fields report, but they also occurred at about the same time as the Spruill raid.

• Cynthia Chapman. Chapman was in the shower at about 6 a.m. on April 2, 2003, when police broke open her door and deployed a flashbang grenade. The grenade struck Chapman’s son Bobby, 15, in the foot. Police found Chapman in the bathroom, forced her to the ground, and put a gun to her head. According to Chapman, one officer asked, “Where is it,” and when Chapman responded that she didn’t know what he was talking about, he replied, “Don’t get smart with me or I’ll kill you.” Chapman and her son were handcuffed, taken to a police station, and released hours later when police discovered they’d raided the wrong home. In 2004, Chapman settled with the city of New York for $100,000.311

• Ana Roman.In 2004, the family of Ana Roman filed an $11 million lawsuit against the city of New York. The suit stemed from a September 12, 1996, noknock raid on the home Roman, then 70, shared with her husband and adult son. Police were acting on a faulty tip from a confidential informant that drugs were being dealt from Roman’s home. Roman emerged from her bedroom to find police pointing assault weapons at her, her husband, and her son. Roman had a heart attack and spent the following two weeks in a cardiac unit. Her family maintains that Roman never fully recovered and died of congestive heart failure six years later as a direct result of the attack she suffered during the raid.312

• Mary Bardy. Bardy went to the city council hearings to give her account of a January 2002 botched raid on her home. Police mistakenly believed her son was dealing drugs. The raiding officers broke down her door and, at gunpoint, ordered everyone inside—including her 2-year-old granddaughter—to lie down.313 “I saw what happened to that poor woman [Spruill] and I said, this is crazy. This can’t keep happening,” Bardy told the New York Daily News. 314 Bardy, who had recently retired after an administrative career with the NYPD, said she wrote “dozens of letters” and “made lots of phone calls” after the raid on her home but found no one who could give her answers about the circumstances of the investigation leading to the night police broke into her home. Her son was never charged.315 A day after the Spruill city council hear-ings, Manhattan Borough President Fields held hearings of her own. According to the Village Voice: Dozens of black and Latino victims— nurses, secretaries, and former officers— packed her chambers airing tales, one more horrifying than the next. Most were unable to hold back tears as they described police ransacking their homes, handcuffing children and grandparents, putting guns to their heads, and being verbally (and often physically) abusive. In many cases, victims had received no follow-up from the NYPD, even to fix busted doors or other physical damage. The Voicethen echoed the Newsday report: Some complainants reported that they had filed grievances with the [Citizen Complaint Review Board] and were told there was no police misconduct. Unless there is proven abuse, the CCRB disregards complaints about warrants that hold a correct address but are faulty because of bad evidence from a [confidential informant].316 The key recommendation from the Fields report was that NYPD produce an annual report detailing “all statistics regarding the execution of warrants.” Fields believed such a report would provide some transparency and accountability in the issuance and execution of drug warrants, particularly those authorizing no-knock raids. NYPD issued no such report in 2005. Less than a year after Spruill’s death, NYPD was back in the headlines with the mistaken raid on Martin and Leona Goldberg, mentioned earlier.317 Another high-profile wrong-door raid that provoked local media and public officials to take a harder look at the use of paramilitary drug raids was the Denver, Colorado, case of Ismael Mena. Ismael Mena. On September 29, 1999, a Denver SWAT team executed a no-knock drug raid on Mena’s home. Mena, a Mexican immigrant, believed he was being robbed and confronted the SWAT team with a gun. Police said they fired the eight shots that killed Mena only after Mena ignored repeated warnings to drop his weapon and first fired at them. Mena’s family says police never announced themselves, and that it was the police who fired first.318 Police later discovered they had raided the wrong home, on the basis of bad information from a confidential informant.319They found no drugs in Mena’s house, nor were any found in his system.320 Subsequent investigations by the city police department’s internal affairs division and by a special prosecutor found no wrongdoing on the part of the SWAT team. But weeks later, new details began to emerge about the Mena case. An aide to the special prosecutor, for example, said that Mena’s body had been moved at least 18 inches after he was shot. A lab report then found that the gunshot residue found on Mena’s hand didn’t match Mena’s gun but was instead only consistent with the residue given off by the submachine guns the SWAT team uses. Police found no fingerprints on Mena’s gun, or on the ammunition inside it, raising speculation that the gun was tampered with or planted.321 An internal affairs investigation cleared the SWAT team of wrongdoing but did find that the officer who prepared the search warrant for Mena’s home falsified information.322As the shooting gained traction in the media, Denver city officials began to portray Mena as a Mexican criminal refugee wanted for murder (Mena had shot a man in Mexico in self-defense but had been cleared of any wrongdoing), a “blame the victim” strategy unfortunately common in police brutality cases. 323 Members of the police department also later started what local media would call a “spy file” on a citizens’ organization agitating for a more thorough investigation of Mena’s death. Worse, the head of the police intelligence unit that kept a “spy file” on Mena’s supporters was also the head of the SWAT team that conducted the raid on Mena’s home.324

Mena’s family eventually hired former FBI agent James Kearney to conduct a private investigation. Over the course of that investigation, Kearney became convinced that Denver police murdered Mena, then planted the gun to cover up the botched raid. Kearney found evidence not uncovered by previous investigations, including two slugs in the floor of Mena’s apartment that suggest the raid didn’t happen as SWAT officials said it did. Kearney made his accusations on a local radio station, leading to a lawsuit against the station and Kearney by members of the SWAT team. The radio station settled. Kearney in turn filed suit against the SWAT team and sought to prove his allegations of a cover-up in court.325 The suit was thrown out in federal court, but as of November 2005 Kearney was still waiting on word of his appeal.326 Mena’s family ultimately settled with the city of Denver for $400,000.327 To its credit, the city of Denver instituted some strong reforms in response to Mena’s death. The reforms drastically cut down on the number of no-knock warrants carried out in the city, though reforms stopped short of an outright prohibition on no-knock warrants for drug raids.328 Denver is the exception, however. Most high-profile SWAT tragedies temporarily put reporters on the scent for similar abuses, light a fire under activists, and put policymakers on the defensive. But that public scrutiny is usually followed by a return to business as usual. The case that spurred the Capital Times indepth investigation of SWAT team proliferation to small-town Wisconsin stemmed from an incident in tiny Dalton, a rural town 50 miles north of Madison. Wendy and Jesus Olveda. Wendy Olveda, who was five months pregnant, her husband Jesus, and their three-year-old daughter Zena were at home one evening in October 2000 when a black-clad SWAT team broke down their front door and threw the couple facefirst to the floor. Zena Olveda looked on from the couch. Jesus Olveda told the paper that as he lifted his head to tell police they had the wrong address, “one of them put a knee on my head and ground it into the floor.”329 Police had the wrong address. When they realized their error, they rushed through the Olveda’s garage door to the home next door. The Times reported that one officer went back to the Olveda’s home minutes later to retrieve the search warrant. The Olvedas filed a claim for compensation against the police departments in charge of carrying out the raid. The claim was rejected.330 Two years before the Olveda raid, police in another small Wisconsin town mistakenly raided the home of Daniel and Cythia Cuervo, holding the couple at gunpoint while the officers ransacked their home. The Cuervos eventually accepted a settlement in their lawsuit against the responsible local police agencies. The mistaken raid on their home inspired a significant reorganization of the Multi-jurisdictional Enforcement Group narcotics unit in the Lake Winnebago area of Wisconsin.331 But the rash of media reports of botched raids in Wisconsin in the year 2000 came a full five years after the state had already done some introspection on paramilitary police tactics when such tactics had ended with a man’s death. Scott Bryant. On April 17, 1995, police in Dodge County, Wisconsin, forcefully entered the mobile home of Scott Bryant after finding traces of marijuana in his garbage. The officers would later say they knocked and announced before entering, but neighbors who witnessed the raid say police entered without doing either. Moments later, Detective Robert Neuman shot an unarmed Bryant in the chest, killing him. Bryant’s eight-yearold son was asleep in the next room. Neuman told investigators he “can’t remember” pulling the trigger.332 Dodge County sheriff Stephen Fitzgerald compared the shooting to a hunting accident.333 Two years later, Bryant’s family was awarded a $950,000 settlement by Dodge County.334 After the Bryant case made headlines, three victims of a similar raid by the Dodge County Sheriff’s Department also filed suit. According to that lawsuit, police raided a home in Juneau, Wisconsin, after finding traces of marijuana and material “suspected of packing cocaine” in garbage bags outside the house. Police entered the home “suddenly and violently” at 2:45 a.m., threw the three occupants to the floor, and handcuffed them. Police then searched the house for more than three hours. No charges were filed.335 After the settlement in the Bryant case, and a year after the shooting, Sheriff Fitzgerald seemed remorseful. He told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel that his own department would make substantial changes to the way it conducts searches. “It’s safe to say any time there’s a tragic accident like this that people would want to do things differently,” he said.336 Unfortunately, that message didn’t make it to other small towns in Wisconsin. According to the Capital Times, 18 new SWAT teams have been formed across the state since the Bryant shooting.337 Although the case studies listed here cut off in the mid-1990s, the epidemic of botched military-style drug raids goes back to the early 1980s.338 As far back as 1990, an article in Playboy magazine took note of a curious rise in media accounts of botched drug raids and published a list of more than a dozen documented “wrong door” raids from the 1980s.339 In 2004, USA Today ran an editorial citing the Spruill and Goldberg raids and calling for reform in the execution of drug warrants. But the same paper ran a similar story more than a decade earlier, in 1993 (and even earlier, in 1989), ticking off a list of botched raids and a critique of noknock and paramilitary raids in general, including the problems with confidential informants, asset forfeiture, lack of oversight, and the militarization of civilian policing described in this study.340 The editorial also included responses from law enforcement officials dismissing botched raids as “isolated incidents.”341 So not only is the problem of mistaken raids not new, neither is the cycle of media and public officials temporarily taking notice of them, then neglecting to enact any real reforms. Here, in reverse chronological order, is a partial list of other documented wrongdoor raids dating back to 1995:

• H. Victor Buerosse. On December 30, 2005, police in Pewaukee, Wisconsin, broke into the home of 68-year-old H. Victor Buerosse in a predawn raid. Buerosse was thrown into a closet door, then to the ground, and hit in the head with a police shield. Despite his protests that police had the wrong address, they didn’t concede their mistake until a sergeant arrived later. They left without an apology. The SWAT team eventually raided the correct residence, where they found a small amount of marijuana. Buerosse, a retired attorney, told a local reporter: “SWAT teams are not meant for simple pot possession cases. The purpose of SWAT teams it to give police departments a specially trained unit to react to a violent situation, not to create one. This should not happen in America. To me you can’t justify carrying out simple, routine police work this way.”342

• Michelle Clancy. At 5:30 a.m. on December 21, 2005, police in Paterson, New Jersey, stormed the home of Michelle Clancy on a drug warrant, breaking off her doorknob. Clancy, her 65-year-old father, and her 13-year-old daughter were home at the time. Police later confirmed they had raided the wrong apartment. Police spokesman Lt. Anthony Traina told one reporter, “These things do happen.”343

• The Baker Family. Early in the morning on September 30, 2005, police in Stockbridge, Georgia, conducted a noknock raid on the home of Roy and Belinda Baker. Officers broke down the couple’s front door with a battering ram and tossed in flashbang grenades. The police held the couple at gunpoint, handcuffed them, and then sent them out onto their porch, only partially clothed. Police ruined a family Bible and antique coffee table during the raid. The raiding officers eventually realized the intended target of their raid lived next door. Police Chief Russ Abernathy called the raid “inexcusable” and “not acceptable” and blamed poor street lighting for the mistaken address. But Abernathy added that no one would be fired and that the raids would go on, albeit after “reviewing procedures.” The Bakers are considering a lawsuit.344

• Harold and Carolyn Smith. In September 2005, police in Bel Aire, Kansas, raided the home of Harold Smith, the town’s former mayor, after mistaking sunflowers in the man’s backyard for marijuana plants. Police had taken pictures of the plants and showed them to a judge, who then approved the search warrant. Police rifled through the mayor and his wife’s belongings and took videotape of their home before realizing their mistake.345

• David Scheper. On August 18, 2005, police in Baltimore, Maryland, forced their way into the home of David Scheper and Sascha Wagner. Thinking they were being robbed, Wagner called 911, telling the operator, “There’s someone breaking into my house.” Scheper had already slammed the door on the officer, who never announced they were police. The police then shattered the glass on the home’s front door. Scheper stood just inside, holding his 12-gauge shotgun. He didn’t have ammunition but hoped that racking the gun within earshot of the door would scare off the intruders. When they wouldn’t leave, Scheper retreated to his basement and grabbed the only functioning weapon in his house, a CZ- 52 semiautomatic. As Scheper struggled to load the weapon, it accidentally discharged, sending a round into the floor of his basement. Police took $1,440 in cash Scheper says he had recently withdrawn to buy a used truck. According to the Baltimore City Paper, police also “hit a 70-year-old art-deco-style metal desk with an ax. They took 18 of Scheper’s guns—mostly inoperable antiques, he says. ‘They threatened to blow up my safe,’ Scheper says, so he opened it for them.” The police were mistaken. They were looking for a tenant Scheper had evicted weeks earlier. Nevertheless, police still put Scheper’s antique gun collection on display for the local news as part of a “roundup” of illegal weapons they’d found in two raids. Police charged Scheper for firing the weapon in his basement, a charge that carried a possible $1,000 fine and a year in prison. Prosecutors eventually dropped that charge, but only after Scheper’s lawyer successfully fought to get Wagner’s 911 call admitted as evidence.346

• Cedelie Pompee.In August 2005, police in Newark, New Jersey, raided a home owned by 59-year-old Cedelie Pompee while looking for drugs and guns. Pompee, her family, and the family to whom she rents an apartment said police cursed them while ravaging through their belongings. Officials from the state police SWAT team and the DEA later realized they had raided the wrong address. The Associated Press reports that state police had made a similar mistake four months earlier.347

• John Simpson. On June 15, 2005, Nampa, Idaho, police serving a search warrant tossed a flashbang grenade into the home of Vietnam veteran John Simpson. The frightened Simpson first took cover and attempted to protect his wife. He then composed himself, assumed he was being attacked by intruders, and ventured out with the only weapon he could find, the hose from his vacuum cleaner. The police had targeted the wrong side of Simpson’s duplex. “I guess we’re going to have to seek psychological help, I hate to say that,” Simpson told the Associated Press. “I’m not nuts or anything, but I’m still shaking. Put a shotgun next to your ear and pull the trigger to get an idea of the noise.” Police later picked up Simpson’s neighbor with four ounces of marijuana.348

• The Chidester Family.In May 2005 in Utah County, Utah, Larry Chidester awoke to hear explosions at the home next to his. He went outside and saw members of a local SWAT team preparing to raid his neighbor’s home. According to a lawsuit filed by the Chidester family, one of the SWAT officers spotted Larry Chidester, pointed at him, and exclaimed, “There’s one!” Chidester threw his hands in the air and repeatedly said, “I’m not resisting.” The officer tackled Chidester and, according to Chidester, “shoved his face into the ground and rocks.” Larry Chidester was later taken to the emergency room for treatment. Police then kicked open a side door to the Chidester home and swarmed the bedroom where Lawrence Chidester—Larry’s father—was dressing. They threw him to the floor and trained a gun to the back of his head. SWAT officers later conceded they had raided the wrong home. Utah County sheriff Jim Tracy later admitted the Chidester home wasn’t the original target of the raid, but that police decided to raid their home as “an ancillary issue.” He said police disputed the accuracy of the Chidesters’ account of the raid, but wouldn’t give details.349

• Queen Moore. On October 10, 2004, police in Omaha, Nebraska, conducted a narcotics raid on the home of Queen Moore, an elderly woman. When Moore filed suit for the damage officers did to her home, the police initially refused to be interviewed, on advice from the police union. Worse, the police department told Moore her complaint wasn’t valid because union rules required it to be handwritten, not typewritten. Moore’s lawyer responded that requiring her to personally write out her complaint “is not only illegal, but unduly burdensome and harassing,” as Moore could barely sign her own name. Police found no contraband in Moore’s home. She was never charged or arrested.350

• Teresa Guiler and James Elliott. In September 2004, a SWAT team in Clarksville, Tennessee, erroneously raided the home of Teresa Guiler, 55, and James Elliott, 54. Elliot, who is deaf, was recovering from a liver transplant at the time of the raid. The warrant had identified the wrong home. Police Chief Mark Smith said he would investigate to make sure the same mistake didn’t happen again.351

• Blair Davis. On July 27, 2004, police in Houston, Texas, broke open the door of Blair Davis, a landscape contractor. Police screamed “Down on the Floor! Down on the Floor!” while pointing an assault weapon at Davis’s head. Davis’s first thought was that the invaders were criminals dressed as police, a continuing problem in the Houston area. A team of 8–10 police officers pushed Davis to the ground and handcuffed him while they searched his home. They were acting on a tip from a confidential informant who said Davis was growing marijuana in his home. The plants in question turned out to be hibiscus plants. Police never apologized to Davis. Dan Webb, operations commander for the police team that conducted the raid, later said it was “unfortunate” that Davis “got caught up in this situation,” but that “if the situation came up today, we would’ve probably done the same thing.” Webb added, “It’s not a mistaken search warrant . . . if we believe it’s marijuana, until we go look at it, we’re not really going to know for sure,” overlooking the fact that an innocent person was needlessly terrorized due to his unit “not knowing for sure.”352

• Donald and Amber Mundy. In February 2004, police in San Bernardino, California, looking for cocaine broke open the door to an apartment occupied by Donald Mundy and his twin sister, Amber. When officers realized they had raided apartment “204” instead of apartment “214” as specified in the warrant, they conducted a search anyway and arrested Amber Mundy on charges of misdemeanor marijuana possession.353

• Marion Waltman. In September 2003, an informant’s tip led police in Gulfport, Mississippi, to raid land leased by Marion Waltman. Waltman was growing kenaf plants, which are commonly used for deer food. Police raided the property and mistakenly destroyed more than 500 plants, believing they were marijuana. A judge later ruled that the city wasn’t obligated to compensate Waltman for the destruction of his property because the sheriff’s department made an “honest mistake.”354

• Earline Jackson.At 3 a.m. on September 5, 2003, a dozen Chicago police officers used a battering ram to break down the door of 73-year-old widow Earline Jackson’s apartment. “I asked them, ‘What did I do?’ And they told me to get out of the way because they were looking for drugs,” Jackson told the Chicago Tribune. A warrant for Jackson’s address said police believed a man was using her apartment to sell drugs. Police had mistaken Jackson’s apartment for an apartment one block south.355

• Francisca Perez. On August 2, 2003, police from the Bexar County, Texas, sheriff’s department raided the home of Francisca Perez and her children. The raid was based on a tip from an informant that a woman named Rosalinda Mendez was selling cocaine from the house. Police handcuffed Perez and her 13-year-old daughter, while her 11-yearold daughter and three-year-old son watched in horror as police destroyed her house looking for drugs. They found nothing incriminating. Four weeks later, police still hadn’t told Perez whether or not she was under investigation. According to the latest media reports available, Perez, the widow of a Gulf War veteran, was still attempting to get the police to clear her name. She told a local newspaper that she was reluctant to take legal action because her children were terrified that if she did, the police would come back to raid their home again.356

• Gabrielle Wescott. On July 29, 2003, police in Montana raided the home of Gabrielle Wescott and her daughter Annabelle Heasley. According to a 2005 lawsuit, agents from the Northwest Drug Task Force donned black hoods and SWAT gear and raided their home at 7:30 a.m. on a marijuana warrant. Police forced the two to the ground, handcuffed them, and according to the lawsuit, “mistreated, threatened, cursed at, and terrorized” them, while police “ransacked the house” and “cut pieces of drywall out of the basement.” The complaint alleges that the police affidavit leading to the search warrant “contains half-truths and inaccuracies and clearly was not completed in good faith,” and that police never identified themselves. The women were never charged.357

• The Phoenix Hell’s Angels.In July 2003, police in Phoenix, Arizona, conducted a pre-dawn drug raid on a Hell’s Angels club. Police knocked, then waited just six seconds before deploying a flashbang grenade and forcing their way into the clubhouse. Michael Wayne Coffelt, who was asleep at the time, awoke to the grenade and quickly armed himself with a pistol. When Coffelt, who thought the clubhouse was being robbed, approached the door, Officer Laura Beeler shot and wounded him. Beeler claims Coffelt fired at her, though a ballistics test later confirmed that Coffelt never discharged his gun. Police did not find any drugs in the clubhouse. Prosecutors later brought charges against Coffelt for assaulting a police officer. In dismissing the charges, Maricopa Superior Court judge Michael Wilkinson described the raid as an “attack” in violation of the Fourth Amendment, and said Coffelt’s actions were “reasonable behavior, given the hour and the fact that the house was under attack.” Wilkinson also determined that Beeler’s mistaken belief that Coffelt had fired at her was also understandable, given the volatility of such a raid and that the officer may have misinterpreted the flashbang grenade for a gunshot.358

• The Holguin Family.According to court documents filed in conjunction with a lawsuit, the Holguin family of Albuquerque, New Mexico, say police blew their door off its hinges, deployed flashbang grenades, then stormed their home on June 5, 2003. Carmen Holguin, 80, required medical treatment for injuries she sustained during the raid. The lawsuit also alleges that Julia Holguin, 55, was injured when an officer stepped on her back, and that police kicked an unnamed 14-year-old girl while executing the warrant. None of the four were charged, and police seized nothing from the home. A paralegal for the family’s lawyer told the Associated Press that police had made a controlled cocaine buy on the street where the Holguins lived and indicated they may have mistaken the family’s home for the place they had bought the drugs.359

• Sandy Cohen. In 2002, police in Philadelphia raided the home of 85- year-old Sandy Cohen as she was taking a shower. Cohen got to her door just as police were blowing it off its hinges. When she protested to police that they had raided the wrong home, one replied, “That’s what they all say.” Police later conceded they’d made a mistake. Cohen’s neighbors had told the raiding officers they were making a mistake while they were planting the explosives outside her door.360

• The Huerta Family. On November 20, 2002, a San Antonio, Texas, SWAT team deployed tear gas canisters, shattered a glass door with bullets, then stormed an apartment occupied by three Hispanic men. “We were kicked and punched at least 20 times. I couldn’t talk. I was good and scared,” Salvador Huerta told the San Antonio News-Express. His cousin Marcos Huerta was taken to the hospital with a cut face and bruised head. Vincent Huerta added, “The way they entered, I never thought it could be police.” All three thought the raid was a robbery. Police had the wrong address.361 Police later blamed the mistake on darkness, and “a cluster of look-alike buildings,” despite the fact that officers stated on the warrant that they had conducted surveillance on the suspected residence for two days.362

• Irene Gilliam Hensley. On August 14, 2002, police in La Porte, Texas, stormed the home of 88-year-old Irene Gilliam Hensley on a paramilitary raid after a tip that her grandson Charles Gilliam was growing marijuana in her backyard. The tip came from an aunt who had had an argument with Gilliam, and police decided to raid after an officer peeked over Hensley’s fence and confirmed the presence of marijuana. According to the Houston Chronicle, the warrant specifically stated that the officer who peeked over the fence had experience identifying marijuana plants. The plants turned out to be okra. Police found no drugs in the home.363

• The Gilbertson Family. In February 2002, a SWAT team in Denver’s Highland neighborhood shattered a window in anticipation of a raid. Upon looking inside, they discovered they had broken into the wrong townhouse. They were preparing to deploy a flashbang grenade in the home, occupied by Erik Gilbertson and his pregnant wife. The couple was at the opera at the time of the raid. A police spokesman called the raid an “understandable mistake.”364

• Maria Flores. In May 2001, police in Austin, Texas, raided the home of Maria Flores, a grandmother. A flashbang grenade shattered her window, and the SWAT team entered behind by kicking in her door. Police shoved Flores to the ground, bound her, and held her at gunpoint while they tore apart her home in a search for cocaine. They had mistaken her house for the house next door. Flores was taken to the hospital with internal bruising. “For about 20 minutes, I was on the floor crying, wondering ‘What’s going on?’” Flores told the Austin American Statesman. “I’m just glad my grandkids weren’t here.” Six months after the raid, police acknowledged the raid was a “terrible mistake.” Assistant Police Chief Jim Fealy said, “We violated that woman’s privacy and needlessly [sic] by mistake.” He attributed the error to “sloppy police work.”365

• Estelle Newcomb. In October 2001, a drug task force in Middlesex, Virginia, broke down the door of 50-year-old Estelle Newcomb and her 80-year-old aunt. Police had targeted the wrong home after miscommunicating with an informant. The investigating officer told the Associated Press: “I knew this was not right. To be honest with you, it was sloppy police work—not being thorough enough.” The previous July, the same task force, along with the National Guard and state police, conducted a raid on a suspect they thought was growing marijuana. The plants turned out to be tomatoes.366

• Charles and Debora Alexander. On August 17, 2001, police in Waco, Texas, served a drug warrant on the home of Debora and Charles Alexander. According to the Waco Tribune-Herald, police charged the residence with guns drawn, yelling “Police, search warrant!” before realizing they had entered the wrong apartment. The Alexanders’ visiting nine-year-old grandson, who has Down’s Syndrome, went into a seizure. Debora Alexander fainted. Charles Alexander says that upon realizing their mistake, police left without apologizing, or offering to help either Debora or the grandson. Just seconds before the raid, Debora had been unpacking boxes, one of which contained her husband’s gun. Charles told the TribuneHerald, “God only knows what would have happened if they would have walked down that hall with her holding that gun.” Remarkably, on August 20—three days after the raid—Lieutenant Gary McCully told the paper he wasn’t aware that his own officers had entered the wrong apartment until a reporter had called and told him.367

• Sandra Smith. In May 2001, a Travis County, Texas, SWAT team conducted a raid on the home of Sandra Smith for suspicion of growing marijuana. After departing from a helicopter, storming Smith’s home, kicking her dog, ransacking her belongings, and holding her and three visitors at gunpoint, police discovered the plants were ragweed. “This is the most terrifying thing that’s ever happened to me in my life,” Smith said. “I’ve never been in trouble with the law.” Smith filed a lawsuit against the city for damage to her home. At the time the suit was filed in 2002, her name was in the department’s database as a narcotics offender. Travis County settled with Smith and her visitors for $40,000. The Travis County SWAT team was later dissolved after a series of questionable raids.368

• Henry and Denise McKnight. On February 27, 2001, at about 10:30 p.m., police in Topeka, Kansas, kicked open the front door, detonated a flashbang grenade, and held Henry and Denise McKnight and their seven children at gunpoint on a drug warrant. They had mistaken the McKnight’s home for the home next door. The McKnights’ subsequent lawsuit alleged that police questioned them at gunpoint and continued to search the home even after realizing they’d made a mistake. Police Chief Ed Klumpp acknowledged the mistake and said that the police department would make “minor adjustments” to its procedures, though he wouldn’t say what those adjustments would be “because it would jeopardize the safety of our officers.” The Topeka City Council eventually settled with the family for $95,000.369

• Susan Wilson. On February 15, 2001, a SWAT team dressed in full-assault attire stormed the home of Muskego, Wisconsin, resident Susan Wilson, 49. Wilson was standing in her driveway with her dog when the Waukesha County Metro Drug Enforcement Group apprehended her. Police forced her face down on her snowcovered drive, handcuffed her, and held her at gunpoint while police searched her home. They had the wrong address.370

• Sandra Hillman.On January 19, 2001, police from Russellville and Franklin County, Alabama, raided the home of Sandra Hillman and her daughter Marquita. Agents with a no-knock warrant kicked down the door to Hillman’s apartment and held the two women handcuffed and at gunpoint while conducting their search. Police never identified themselves. Hillman made two subsequent trips to an emergency room for heart problems related to the raid. Police had the wrong address.371

• John Adams. On October 4, 2000, at about 10 p.m., police in Lebanon, Tennessee, raided the home of 64-year-old John Adams on a drug warrant. In what Lebanon police chief Billy Weeks would later say was a “severe, costly mistake,” police had identified the wrong house. According to Adams’s wife, police would not identify themselves after knocking on the couple’s door. After she refused to let them in, they broke down the door and handcuffed her. Adams met the police in another room with a sawed-off shotgun. Police opened fire and shot Adams dead. One officer was fired after the incident, and several others were suspended, but no criminal charges were filed.372 Adams’s widow eventually won a $400,000 settlement from the city.373

• Daniel and Rosa Unis.In 2000, federal agents in Pueblo, Colorado, stormed the home of Daniel and Rosa Unis after suspecting their sons of cocaine distribution. With no warrant, police in black ski masks broke into the Unis home at gunpoint and arrested Marcos and David Unis. The two were kept in custody for two days but were never charged. When the Unis family filed a federal lawsuit in 2005, the lawyer for the agent in charge of the raid conceded that the raid was illegal. One officer described the incident as “unfortunate” and said “miscommunication” led to the wrongful raid, arrests, and detainments.374

• William and Geneva Summers. On May 22, 2000, police in Pulaski, Virginia, conducted a 4 a.m. raid on the home of William and Geneva Summers. The SWAT team broke through the couple’s back door, woke them, and held them at gunpoint. Police had the wrong address. They had raided the home on the basis of a tip from a “reliable” informant that there was a methamphetamine lab inside. Magistrate Judge Jill Long concluded that police assertions that the informant was “reliable” were sufficient to establish probable cause for a pre-dawn, forced-entry search. The informant later admitted he had lied.375

• Brandon and Richelle Savage.On April 6, 2000, police in Chicago raided the apartment of Brandon and Richelle Savage on bad information from an informant. Police broke down the door and ordered the couple out of bed at gunpoint before realizing their mistake. Police officials then ignored the Savages’ request to pay for damage done to their apartment until a columnist reported the incident in the Chicago Sun-Times. 376

• Dovie Walker. On December 4, 1999, police in El Dorado, Arkansas, conducted a drug raid on the home of Dovie Walker. Officers tore the woman’s front door from its hinges with a battering ram, damaged another door to her bed-room, broke a latch on a third door, overturned and broke Walker’s furniture, and generally “demolished” her house. Police officers had handcuffed Walker’s three children at gunpoint before realizing they had mistaken her house for the one next door. Walker was also babysitting children of ages one, two, and three at the time of the raid. When a police department spokesman told a local newspaper police had no intention of paying for the damage they did to Walker’s home, El Dorado’s mayor promised four days later to begin work on the damage to Walker’s house “as soon as possible.”377

• The Tyson Family. On October 20, 1999, police from the DEA, the FBI, and Connecticut Department of Public Safety conducted 30 drug raids at locations around the Hartford area. One of those raids was on the home of 59-yearold Emma Tyson, her daughter-in-law, and her 13-year-old grandson. Twelve police officers broke into Tyson’s home, causing her to have an asthma attack. Police were looking for a suspected drug dealer who had moved out of the home four months earlier, when Tyson bought it. Tyson filed a lawsuit two years later, when federal and local police authorities had yet to apologize or make an effort to clear her name.378

• Mario Paz. On August 9, 1999, 20 police officers from the El Monte, California, SWAT team conducted a late-night raid on the home of 65-yearold Mario Paz. By the end of the raid, Paz had been fatally shot in the back by police. The police version of events changed several times from the night of the raid. Police first said Paz was armed. They next said he wasn’t armed but was reaching for a gun. Their final account was that Paz was reaching not for a gun but to open a drawer where a gun was located. Paz was unarmed when he was shot. Police later revealed that they had conducted the raid after finding the Paz address on the driver’s license, vehicle registration, and an old cell phone bill of suspected drug dealer Marcos Beltran Lizarraga (charges against Lizarraga were subsequently dropped, in part because the videotape that was supposed to contain a recording of the search of his home turned up blank).379 As mentioned earlier, one El Monte police official would later say that anticipated “proceeds” from the Paz family in asset forfeiture also played a part in the raid. The Paz family explained that Lizarraga had lived next to them in the 1980s and had convinced Mario Paz to let him receive mail at their residence after he moved. Three weeks after the raid, the El Monte Police Department announced that they had no evidence that anyone in the Paz family was involved in any illicit drug activity, nor did the SWAT team have any reason to think so on the night Paz was shot.380 During the raid, police seized more than $10,000 in cash and announced plans to claim the money for themselves via asset forfeiture laws. Police backed off those plans when the Paz family proved the money to be their life savings. Shortly after the Paz shooting made headlines, El Monte police conducted another raid on the home of an immigrant family. Police confronted Rosa Felix on September 22, 1999, after breaking into her home. According to a lawsuit Felix would later file, the officers told her that they knew her family was trafficking drugs, that they had information that she knew Paz, and that unless she gave them incriminating information about Paz, they would handcuff her, arrest her, and take away her children. Felix refused, insisting that her only interaction with Paz was from buying used cars from him. Charges were never filed against Felix.381 In October 2001, the officer who shot Paz was exonerated in investigations by both the Department of Justice and the LAPD. A county prosecutor insisted that Officer George Hopkins “acted lawfully in self-defense” during the raid.382 El Monte’s police department was known to be highly militaristic—but also effective. The town’s police department boasted an assault vehicle with gun turret dubbed the “peacekeeper,” as well as a helicopter. In 1992—five years before the Paz shooting—a federal appeals court had found “Chief Wayne Clayton, as a policymaker, acquiesced in a custom of complacency, if not hostility, toward allegations of misconduct by the department’s officers.” One mayor who tried to clean up the police department was voted out of office with help from the town’s police union. “They run city hall. Nobody has control over the police,” former El Monte mayor Pat Wallach told the Los Angeles Times. “They can do as they damn well please. They have a helicopter, a tank. They have carte blanche.”383 In 2002, the city of El Monte settled with the Paz family for $3 million. The city also agreed to 13 conditions put forth by the family, mostly reforms in the way it carries out search warrants and deploys its SWAT team. Even in agreeing to the settlement, however, many city officials insisted the police did nothing wrong. “We don’t view it as whether we were liable for his death,” said city attorney Clarke Moseley. “We believe the family was involved [in narcotics trafficking] to some extent.” No member of the Paz family was ever charged with a crime.384

• Ralph Garrison. On December 16, 1996, a SWAT team wearing black balaclavas raided a rental property owned by 69-yearold Ralph Garrison. Police were acting on a tip that the property contained equipment being used by methamphetamine addicts to print counterfeit checks and currency. Police conducted the 6 a.m. raid with the aid of a helicopter from U.S. Customs and two K-9 units. As the raid commenced, Garrison confronted the police and asked why they were on his property. Raiding officers claim they told Garrison they were police executing a warrant. Just how clear they were is in dispute. Garrison immediately returned to his home to call 911. He asked the dispatcher to send police, because vandals with “axes and all kinds of stuff” were breaking into his rental property. Garrison later told the dispatcher, “I’ve got my gun. I’ll shoot the son of a bitch.” According to raiding officers, Garrison then emerged from his house with a gun, whereupon three officers opened fire on him with AR-15 assault rifles, killing him. Police handcuffed Garrison after shooting him, then searched his home. They also shot his dog, a 14-year-old chow, and handcuffed his wife, 69-year-old Molly Garrison, who said police didn’t remove their hoods or identify themselves until after the raid. Police made no arrests. One of the officers involved in the Garrison raid, Howard Neal Terry, had been subject to three federal excessiveforce lawsuits in the previous six years, causing the city of Albuquerque to pay a total of $375,000 in settlements. In 1999, a federal court dismissed the Garrison estate’s lawsuit against the police department, holding that the officers had “qualified immunity,” which protects them from civil damages in any lawsuit where it is determined that police did not clearly violate any established constitutional protections.385

• Catherine Capps and James Cates. In May 1999, police stormed the Durham, North Carolina, home of 73-year-old Catherine Capps. Also in the house at the time was Capps’s friend, 71-year-old James Cates. Police say they obtained a warrant for the home after a confidential informant bought crack cocaine there. Capps had poor vision, was deaf, and according to her family, “could not even cook an egg without being extremely out of breath.” When police raided the home, they ordered Cates to stand. Hobbled by a war wound and frightened, Cates stumbled at the order and fell into a police officer. Sgt. L. C. Smith apparently mistook Cates’s stumble as a lunge for the officer’s pistol. Smith responded by punching the elderly man twice in the face. Cates, 79, wasn’t permitted to use the bathroom during the search, causing him to urinate on himself. Both Cates and Capps were also strip-searched. No drugs were found in the home or on Capps’s or Cates’s person.386 Capps later died from health maladies her family says she incurred during the raid. She was never charged with selling crack cocaine to the informant because, according to prosecutors, trying her would have required them to release the informant’s name.387Subsequent investigations conducted by the Durham Police Department, the FBI, and the local district attorney found no wrongdoing on the part of police.388 About six months prior to the CappsCates raid, the city of Durham had set up a citizens’ review board, in part due to community complaints about other allegations of excessive force on the part of police. But like similar review boards in other parts of the country, proceedings were often conducted in secret, complainants weren’t given access to witnesses or evidence, and laws regarding search warrants kept vital information sealed. When Capps’s family attempted to file a complaint with the review board, the board instituted a new rule denying a hearing to any complainant who had previously sought financial compensation from the city, and applied the rule retroactively. Though neither Capps nor her family had asked for compensation, Cates had, giving the review board cause to refuse to even listen to a complaint about the raid.389

• Tina and Margie Peterson.On April 4, 1999, police conducted a drug raid on a home in Kaysville, Utah, four days after obtaining the warrant and three weeks after obtaining the information to get the warrant. Despite the fact that a moving van sat in front of the apartment the officers carried on with the raid. They burst in on Tina and Margie Peterson, two sisters who were just moving into the apartment. Police charged in with guns drawn, and ordered the sisters and their two guests to the floor. According to the Petersons, officers continued to detain and question them even after they showed identification and proof that they were new tenants. The sisters filed suit against the police department in 2004.390

• Edwin and Catherine Bernhardt. On February 9, 1999, police in Hallandale, Florida, conducted a late-night raid on the home of Catherine and Edwin Bernhardt. Edwin, whose job requires him to get up at 4 a.m., was asleep. Catherine was on the couch. Police busted open the Bernhardt’s window and jammed an assault rifle inside. Edwin Bernhardt woke up and ran downstairs in the nude. Police pushed Catherine to the floor and handcuffed her at gunpoint. They then subdued, handcuffed, and forced Edwin Bernhardt down into a chair, while a police officer outfitted him with a pair of his wife’s underwear. He was arrested and spent several hours in jail, still clad only in the underwear, until police realized their mistake and drove him home. When the couple later filed suit, the city of Hallandale fought back. City attorney Richard Kane told the Miami Herald that citizens should expect such tactics as the price of the drug war. “They made a mistake. There’s no one to blame for a mistake,” Kane said. “The way these people were treated has to be judged in the context of a war.” When asked to comment on the suit, Fort Lauderdale police captain Tom Tiderington said: ‘‘There’s no perfect formula for success. It could happen at any time.’’ The Herald reported recent similar “wrong door” raids in Seminole County (twice), Largo, and Tampa.391 A year later, police in Hallandale made another botched raid, storming the home of a pregnant woman and her three young children. Police insisted they had the correct house, based on a tip from an informant who said he’d bought drugs there. They didn’t find any drugs. The woman whose home was raided, Tracy Bell, had complained to police about drug activity in the neighborhood and says police had confused her home with the one next door. Bell’s neighbor, who had a criminal record, admitted to having friends involved in drug distribution. Bell had no record. Hallandale police insisted that this time, unlike with the Bernhardt raid, they had the correct address. Bell’s attorney noted that police seem to have made the same mistakes, and offered the same excuse, for this raid as they had with the Bernhardt raid. Attorney Gary Kollin told the Miami Herald, “It appears that they continue to use informants as their scapegoats when they mess up and then they hide behind the confidentiality of the informants to avoid a proper investigation into who is telling the truth.”392

• Earl Richardson. In June 1998, police in Raleigh, North Carolina, broke down the door of 66-year-old Earl Richardson in a mistaken drug raid. Police ordered Richardson to the floor while they rummaged through his belongings. They had meant to raid an unmarked apartment to the rear of Richardson’s home. After an apology from Raleigh mayor Tom Fetzer, Richardson said: “I don’t have anything against the city. I’m just glad I didn’t get shot.”393 Five months later, Raleigh police would conduct another botched raid at the home of Priscilla Clark. “I looked out my bedroom door and saw this big gun coming down the hall and a man dressed in black,” said Clark, who was pregnant at the time. Police locked Clark and her two children in a bedroom for more than hour before realizing they’d raided the wrong home.394

• LaDana Ford. In March 1998, state troopers and local police in Harvey, Illinois, deployed a flashbang grenade then initiated a no-knock raid on the home of LaDana Ford. Police handcuffed Ford’s 13-year-old and questioned her 7-year-old, while keeping the entire family at gunpoint. They later realized they’d raided the wrong address. Harvey police chief Phil Hardiman was unapologetic. “We make out search warrants when we get information from drug informants,” he told the Chicago SunTimes. “Sometimes they give us incorrect information, and warrants are made out for one house when we’re really looking for the house next door. I think that’s what happened here. That happens from time to time in any police department.” When asked if the department would apologize, Hardiman replied: “I don’t know if we’d apologize. It’s not unusual for that to happen sometimes, but I will say it doesn’t happen that often.”395

• The Fulton Family.On March 18, 1998, police raided the Bronx apartment of a grandmother, her daughter, and her sixyear-old grandson. The Fulton family was watching television when police pounded on the door, then broke it open and began tearing through the apartment looking for drugs. They had the wrong apartment.396

• Jennifer Switalski and Tenants. On February 2, 1998, police in Milwaukee conducted a 6:30 a.m. raid on a building owned by Jennifer Switalski. Switalski wasn’t home at the time, but her two tenants were. After breaking down the door, police handcuffed the two tenants while a terrified two-year-old girl looked on. Police had the wrong address. Switalksi later tried to sue the city for emotional distress and loss of income after her frightened tenants moved out. City officials balked. “If it happened to me, I would be upset, too,” said city attorney Louis Elder. “But the taxpayer should not have to pay for hurt feelings because those deputies inadvertently entered the wrong home.” Elder also said Switalski was filled with “grandiose ideas” for attempting to sue the city, though she herself hadn’t witnessed the raid.397

• The Baines Family. On November 8, 1997, police in Suffolk County, New York, received a tip from a drug suspect that residents of a home in Wyandanch were stashing “ a black automatic pistol, two machine guns, a stainless steel sawed-off shotgun, ammunition, bulletproof vests, crack cocaine, proceeds from drugs sales and drug paraphernalia.” Within hours of the tip, and with no corroborating investigation, a judge issued a no-knock warrant and police executed a raid on the address given by the informant. The address turned out to be the home of Denise Baines and her two sons. Baines’s 10-year-old son’s bedroom was trashed in the raid. Police apologized to the Baineses upon realizing they’d raided the wrong home but defended the practice of executing quick, no-knock raids based on the tip of a single informant, even one who himself was a drug suspect.398

• June Nixon. On August 19, 1997, police in Kaufman County, Texas, kicked down the door to the home of June Nixon, her daughter Melissa Cheek, and her granddaughter. Police handcuffed the women and strip-searched them at gunpoint before realizing they’d raided the wrong house. The same sheriff’s department was forced to apologize to two families in 1989 for mistaken drug raids that, according to the Dallas Morning News, “turned up no drugs, but left houses damaged and family members shaken.”399

• Salt Lake Tortilla Factory Raid. In 1997, police in Salt Lake City, Utah, raided a tortilla factory and restaurant owned by Rafael Gomez, a naturalized citizen. Seventy-five heavily armed police officers stormed the business on a tip from a confidential informant. Expecting to find heroin and cocaine, they found only two 24-pill packs of the painkiller Darvon and two bottles of penicillin. Gomez says he was struck in the face and knocked to the floor, and that police trained a gun on his six-yearold son. One secretary says she was dragged to the floor by her hair. Police handcuffed 80 people, mostly Hispanic, in the raid and forced them to lie down for up to three hours as police searched the premises. Gomez spent a large sum of money fighting charges resulting from the raid, which were later dismissed. Bad publicity from the raid and the length of time it took to clear his name killed Gomez’s business and dashed his hopes of opening a large shopping center in the area. He settled with the city of Salt Lake in 2004 for $290,000.400

• The Tarkus Dillard Family. In June 1996, police raided the Pontoon Beach, Illinois, home of Tarkus Dillard, Vickie Blakely, and the couple’s two young children. According to Dillard and Blakely, one officer pointed a gun directly in the face of their three-year-old daughter. Police had mistakenly raided their home instead of the home next door. Police Chief Michael Crouch apologized to Dillard and Blakely but insisted police had done nothing wrong. A federal judge threw out a $1 million lawsuit against the police department in 1998. A lawyer for the police officers called the suit’s dismissal a “tremendous vindication” of the officers’ actions and said he was contemplating suing Dillard and Blakely, to recoup the city’s legal costs.401

• Jeffrey and Phyllis Hampton. In May 1995, police in Concord, North Carolina, mistakenly stormed the home of Jeffrey and Phyllis Hampton. The Hamptons were relaxing at around 9:30 p.m. when police broke down the Hamptons’ door, came into the house with assault weapons, and ordered the couple to the floor. Police realized their mistake after about a half hour of interrogation.402 Three years later, Concord police would wrongly raid another home, that of Leonard Mackin, Charlene Howie, and their four children. Police burst into that home with guns drawn on the night of May 22, 1998, and ordered the family to the floor. After repeated pleas by Mackin to police that they had the wrong house, Detective Larry Welch recognized Mackin as a co-worker with the city and asked, “Leonard, is that you?” A confidential informant had given police the wrong address.403 In 1999, police in the same town shot 15-year-old Thomas Edwards Jr. in the back while he was on his hands and knees under orders from another police paramilitary unit on a drug raid. Edwards and five other children, all aged 13–17, were at the house playing video games when police conducted the raid. Officer Lennie Rivera shot Edwards just below the hip when, according to an internal police investigation, “a sudden movement jolted his gun, causing him to tighten his grip on it and pull the trigger.” Police found a small amount of marijuana and cocaine at the home. Police Chief Robert E. Cansler said that his officers had done surveillance on the home an hour or two prior to the raid and that “at that time there were no indications of a group of children present.” Officer Rivera was found to have improperly held his finger on the gun’s trigger and was assigned to more training.404

• Richard Brown.On March 12, 1996, acting on a tip from an informant, a Miami SWAT team fired 122 rounds into the home of 73-year-old Richard Brown, while his 14 year-old great-granddaughter feared for her life in the bathroom. Brown was killed in the gunfire.405 Police found no drugs in Brown’s home. The city has since paid a $2.5 million settlement to Brown’s survivors, and police on the SWAT team that raided Brown’s home were later indicted for lying about the details of the raid. Internal Affairs supervisor and 25-year police veteran John Dalton, now retired, told the Herald that the head of internal affairs at the time, a former SWAT team member, discouraged a thorough investigation of the Brown case. “They were very defensive about this shooting from the beginning,” Dalton said, adding that he’d been “chewed out” for asking difficult questions.

• Charles Inscor.In March 1995, police in Oldsmar, Florida, smashed through a glass door, deployed flashbang grenades, and stormed what they thought was the apartment of a drug dealer. Instead, they found 31-year-old Charles Inscor, a wheelchair-bound man with a respiratory problem. The SWAT team soon realized it had raided the wrong home. Inscor was hospitalized for a week as a result of the raid. An ensuing investigation found that though deputies made many mistakes during the investigation and raid, no disciplinary action would be taken because no rules were broken. According to the St. Petersburg Times, police couldn’t be disciplined because “the Sheriff’s office had no policies concerning how the SWAT team should serve search warrants.”406 Caught in the Crossfire Even when police have the correct address and have identified the correct suspect, and even if the suspect is correctly considered dangerous, too often they don’t take note of innocent relatives, acquaintances, neighbors, or children who may be present during the raid and unnecessarily put in harm’s way. Perhaps the most notable example of an innocent caught in drug raid crossfire is the case of 11-year-old Alberto Sepulveda. Alberto Sepulveda.Early in the morning on September 13, 2000, agents from the DEA, the FBI, and the Stanislaus County, California, drug enforcement agency conducted raids on 14 homes in and around Modesto, California after a 19-month investigation. According to the Los Angeles Times, the DEA and FBI asked that local SWAT teams enter each home unannounced to secure the area ahead of federal agents, who would then come to serve the warrants and search for evidence. Federal agents warned the SWAT teams that the targets of the warrants, including Alberto Sepulveda’s father Moises, should be considered armed and dangerous.407 After police forcibly entered the Sepulveda home, Alberto, his father, his mother, his sister, and his brother were ordered to lie face down on the floor with arms outstretched. Half a minute after the raid began, the shotgun that officer David Hawn had trained on Alberto accidentally discharged, instantly killing the 11-year-old. No drugs or weapons were found in the home.408 The Los Angeles Times reports that when Modesto police asked federal investigators if there were any children present in the Sepulveda home, they replied, “Not aware of any.”409There were three. A subsequent internal investigation by the Modesto Police Department found that the DEA’s evidence against Moises Sepulveda—who had no previous criminal record—was “minimal.” In 2002 he pled guilty to the last charge remaining against him as a result of the investigation—using a telephone to distribute marijuana.410The city of Modesto and the federal government settled a lawsuit brought by the Sepulvedas for the death of their son for $3 million.411 At first, Modesto police chief Roy Wasden seemed to be moved by Sepulveda’s death toward genuine reform. “What are we gaining by serving these drug warrants?” Wasden is quoted as asking in the Modesto Bee. “We ought to be saying, ‘It’s not worth the risk. We’re not going to put our officers and community at risk anymore.’”412 Unfortunately, as part of the settlement with the Sepulvedas, while Modesto announced several reforms in the way its SWAT team would carry out drug raids, there was no mention of discontinuing the use of paramilitary units to conduct no-knock or knock-and-announce warrants on nonviolent drug offenders.413 Here are some other cases of people caught in drug-raid crossfire who weren’t suspects:

• Michael Meluzzi. On July 8, 2005, a Sarasota, Florida, SWAT team conducted a drug raid on a home where several children were playing in the front yard. The SWAT team descended from a van, deployed flashbang grenades in front of and inside the house, then swarmed the home. Forty-four-year-old Michael Meluzzi, who had a criminal record, fled when he saw the armed agents exit the van. Police chased Meluzzi down and fired a Taser gun at him, only partially hitting him. According to Officer Alan Devaney, Meluzzi then reached into his waistband, leading Devaney to believe Meluzzi was armed. Devaney opened fire, killing Meluzzi. Police found no weapon on or near Meluzzi’s body.414

• Ronnie Goodwin. On May 26, 2005, a SWAT team conducted a drug raid on the Syracuse, New York, home of Sonya Goodwin while looking for drug suspect Angelo Jenkins. Police had Ronnie Goodwin, 13, on the living room floor at gunpoint when a deputy on the SWAT team fired off several shots at the Goodwin’s dog. One of those bullets ricocheted, striking the boy in the leg. Goodwin’s mother later filed a lawsuit, claiming the boy suffered “severe and debilitating” injuries as a result of the bullet.415

• Cheryl Lynn Noel. On January 21, 2005, Baltimore County, Maryland, police raided the Dundalk neighborhood home of Charles and Cheryl Noel at around 5 a.m. on a narcotics warrant. They’d obtained the warrant after finding marijuana seeds and stems in the Noels’ trash. They deployed a flashbang grenade, then quickly subdued the firstfloor occupants—a man and two young adults. When officers entered the second-floor bedroom of Cheryl Lynn Noel, they broke open her door to find the middle-aged woman in her bed, frightened, pointing a handgun at them. One officer fired three times. Noel died at the scene.416 Friends and acquaintances described Noel as “a wonderful person.” One man collected 200 signatures from friends, neighbors, and coworkers vouching for her character.417 One possible reason Noel brandished a gun to defend herself: Nine years earlier, her stepdaughter had been murdered.418 Police charged Noel’s husband and two children with misdemeanor possession of marijuana and marijuana paraphernalia.419 A subsequent investigation found no wrongdoing on the part of the police.420

•Rhiannon Kephart. In January 2005, 18-year-old Rhiannon Kephart was hospitalized in serious condition after she received severe burns during a pre-dawn paramilitary raid on a Niagara Falls apartment. Kephart—who wasn’t the target of the raid—suffered second- and third-degree burns on her chest and stomach after the flashbang grenade tossed through a window by the raiding officers landed on the bed where she was sleeping. The grenade ignited the bed sheets, setting off a fire in the apartment.421

•James Hoskins. On February 6, 2004, Middletown, Pennsylvania, police stormed the home of James Hoskins on a drug warrant. They were looking for Hoskin’s brother Jim, whom they eventually arrested for possessing “a small amount of marijuana, a glass pipe, and about $622,” according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. 422 When Hoskins heard the loud thud of police breaking into his home, he got up from his bed to investigate, naked and unarmed. As he approached the bedroom door, a Middletown detective pushed his way into Hoskins’ bedroom. Hoskins and his girlfriend say the detective never identified himself. Later explaining that he mistook the T-shirt Hoskins was using to cover his genitalia for a gun, the detective fired. The bullet entered Hoskins’ abdomen, then ripped through his stomach, small intestine, and colon. It eventually lodged in his leg, which later had to be amputated. It wasn’t until weeks later, after he emerged from a coma, that Hoskins learned the man who shot him was a police officer, not a criminal intruder.423 Remarkably, the Middletown Township police department saw no need to conduct an internal investigation of the shooting until prodded by the district attorney.424 The district attorney’s own investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the shooting officer. 425 Hoskins settled a lawsuit with the city of Middletown in 2005 for an undisclosed amount of money. He settled with the local township for $250,000.426

• Desmond Ray.On December 11, 2002, police in Prince George’s County, Maryland, were preparing for a SWAT raid on a suspected drug dealer. Just as the raid commenced, Desmond Ray—who wasn’t the target of the raid—got out of a parked car. Cpl. Charles Ramseur says Ray reached for his waistband when exiting the car. Ray says he put his hands in the air. Ramseur fired his weapon at Ray, striking him in the spine and paralyzing him. Ray wasn’t armed and was never charged with a crime. In April 2004, an “Executive Review Panel” found that Ramseur had no justification for shooting Ray and recommended administrative charges against him for using excessive force. But that recommendation was overruled when the internal police review board later found no wrongdoing. Ramseur was reinstated. The county police settled a civil suit with Ray for an undisclosed sum of money.427

• Meredith “Buddy” Sutherland. On October 4, 2002, police raided a home in Windsor, Pennsylvania, on suspicion of drug activity. According to news reports, the raid was doomed from the start—the SWAT team was aware that someone inside the home had spotted them, meaning they’d lost the element of surprise SWAT proponents say is the main reason for conducting paramilitary drug raids in the first place. Police raided anyway. Once inside, police went from room to room in the dark home. Trooper Gregory Broaddus entered a bedroom where Meredith “Buddy” Sutherland Jr. was sleeping. Sutherland didn’t live in the house, but was visiting a friend. Officer Broaddus mistakenly thought Sutherland was clutching a weapon when he entered the room, and fired, striking Sutherland. Sutherland had no weapon and was never charged with a crime. Other occupants were eventually charged with drug crimes. Sutherland sued in June 2004 for compensation for his injuries. The state attorney general asked that the suit be dismissed, arguing that the officer in question had immunity and that Sutherland was ultimately responsible for his own injuries.428

• Julius Powell. On August 22, 2001, police conducted a paramilitary marijuana raid on the Powell family in North Minneapolis, Minnesota. As they were approaching the house to conduct the raid, police shot and killed a pit bull a man was walking just outside the house. One of the bullets ricocheted and struck the forearm of 11-year-old Julius Powell, who at the time was taking out the family trash. Police did find some marijuana in the home. The incident—the latest in a series of police shootings in the city— sparked riots and protests.429 • Tony Martinez. On December 20, 2001, police in Travis County, Texas, stormed a mobile home on a no-knock drug warrant. Nineteen-year-old Tony Martinez, nephew of the man named in the warrant, was asleep on the couch. When Martinez rose from the couch as police broke into the home, deputy Derek Hill shot him in the chest, killing him.430 Martinez was unarmed and never suspected of a crime. A grand jury later declined to indict Hill in the shooting.431 The shooting occurred less than a mile from the spot of a botched drug raid that cost Deputy Keith Ruiz his life a year earlier. Hill was also on the raid that ended with the death of Ruiz.432The same Travis County paramilitary unit would later erroneously raid a woman’s home after mistaking ragweed for marijuana plants.

• Lynette Gayle Jackson. On September 22, 2000, police in Riverdale, Georgia, shot and killed Lynette Gayle Jackson in an early morning, no-knock drug raid. A few weeks earlier, Jackson had been at home alone when burglars broke into her house. She escaped out a window and called the police while the intruders ransacked her home. When police arrived to answer the burglary call, they found a small amount of cocaine in the bedroom, which belonged to Jackson’s boyfriend. While the quantity of cocaine wasn’t sufficient to press charges, police began a subsequent investigation of Jackson’s boyfriend. That investigation led to the September no-knock raid. Jackson, believing she was again being robbed, was holding a gun in her bedroom when the SWAT team entered. Her maintenance man said Jackson had been frightened by the previous burglary, telling the Atlanta Journal and Constitution, “I think she was scared and she probably thought it was another break-in.”433

• Willie and Charles Alford.On February 27, 2002, police raided the home of 77- year-old Willie Alford on a narcotics warrant issued for his daughter and two grandchildren. Police from the federal Drug Enforcement Agency; the Cumberland County, North Carolina, Sheriff’s Office; and the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation broke into the home at 8 p.m. and, according to Alford, “came in shooting.” Two children were also present in the home. Police shot Alford’s son Charles, a truck driver visiting from out of town who wasn’t a suspect, in the arm, legs, and side. Police found no weapons in the home. Two suspects named in the warrant were arrested at the site of the raid, and one was arrested the following day.434

• Jose Colon. On April 19, 2002, police were preparing to conduct a heavily armed late-night drug raid (it included a helicopter) on a home in Bellport, New York. As four paramilitary unit officers rushed across the front lawn, 19-year-old Jose Colon emerged from the targeted house. According to the police account of the raid, as officers approached, one officer tripped over a tree root, then fell forward and into the lead officer, causing his gun to accidentally discharge three times.435 One of the three bullets hit Colon in the side of the head, killing him. Police say they screamed at Colon to “get down” as they approached, though two witnesses told a local newscast that (a) their screams were inaudible over the sound of the helicopter. The witnesses also stated that (b) the officers appeared to be frozen before the shooting—no one tripped.436 Though he was visiting the house at the time, Colon was never suspected of buying or selling drugs. Police proceeded with the raid and seized eight ounces of marijuana. A subsequent investigation found no criminal wrongdoing on the part of police.437 Colon had no criminal record and was months away from becoming the first member of his family to earn a bachelor’s degree. His family is pursuing a lawsuit.438

• Christie Green. In December 1998, police in Richmond, Virginia, conducted a paramilitary drug raid on an apartment whose occupant was suspected of drug activity. During the raid, Sgt. George Ingram fired “breaching round” shotgun shells—intended to blow the locks off doors—into the door leading to the apartment’s kitchen. Ingram fired five rounds, one of which went through the door, striking 18-year-old Christie Green in the chest. Green later died from the wound. Green didn’t live at the apartment, and police concede they had no reason to believe she was involved in any drug activity or that she knew any was going on in the apartment. Green’s family sued both the city of Richmond and the manufacturer of the round, which is designed to dissolve on impact. In 2002, a circuit court jury found that the manufacturer of the round wasn’t liable for Green’s death. Then, in 2004, a judge in Richmond found that the officer who fired the round wasn’t liable either.439 In March 2005, the Virginia State Supreme Court reinstated the case against the city and the officer, ruling that a jury, not a judge, should make the determination of liability. In January 2006, a jury found Officer Ingram grossly negligent in the raid and awarded the Green family $1.5 million in damages.440

• Delbert Bonar. On October 15, 1998, deputies in Washington County, Ohio, made an unannounced nighttime entry into the home of 57-year-old Delbert Bonar, a retired school janitor. Police had a search warrant to look for stolen weapons and marijuana in the possession of Albert Bonar, Delbert’s son. Police claim that upon their entering the home, the elder Bonar grabbed a shotgun and ignored orders to release it. Albert Bonar’s wife disputes this account of the raid. Police shot Delbert Bonar eight times, killing him. Police found a small amount of marijuana in the house. Though the Washington County sheriff insisted his men acted properly, the county paid the Bonar family a $450,000 settlement in 2003.441 The Threat to Law Enforcement Because SWAT raids escalate the violence associated with executing a search warrant, they not only increase the odds of unintended civilian casualties, but they can lead—and have led—to tragic consequences for police officers, too. The volatility of these raids means that the slightest of errors—not just in ensuring that the information on the warrants is correct but in the actual execution of the raids—can be catastrophic for everyone involved. The following is a partial list of raids in which police officers were killed or injured:

• The Jillian King Raid. On January 14, 2003, Jillian D. King shot and wounded a Muncie, Indiana, police officer as a SWAT team in black masks and camouflage conducted a raid on her boyfriend’s home. Officers were serving a no-knock warrant after finding cocaine inside the car of another resident of the house. King, who had been previously robbed at gunpoint, fired at what she thought were intruders.442 “I saw what appeared to be a burglar jerking at the door,” she told the court. “I ran down and got a gun and shot out a window.” King was never charged with drug possession but was charged with felony criminal recklessness. During her trial, King said if she had known the intruders were police, “I would have opened the door.” The prosecutor described her as having “an itchy trigger finger.” Though individual Muncie SWAT team members testified they “always” announce themselves and wait before entering a residence, they also said they typically wait just five seconds between knocking and forcing entry, clearly not enough time for a suspect in another room or asleep to answer. Video of the raid in question showed officers prying open doors before knocking or announcing.443 King originally pled guilty to the charge, but a judge refused to accept her plea. The jury deadlocked in her trial.444

• The Lewis Cauthorne Raid.On January 7, 2003, prosecutors in Baltimore, Maryland, announced they would not seek charges against Lewis S. Cauthorne for firing a .45-caliber handgun at police who broke down his door during a no-knock raid in November 2002. Cauthorne, at home with his mother, girlfriend, and three-year-old daughter, heard screaming when police broke open the door to his home and began searching for drugs without identifying themselves. Prosecutors determined that Cauthorne, who had no arrest record and whose father had been robbed and killed as a cab driver, had reason to believe his life was in danger when he fired and wounded four of the raiding police officers. Police fired back, but fortunately, no one in the family was hurt. Police were acting on a tip from a confidential informant and claim to have found six bags with traces of marijuana, empty vials, a razor with cocaine residue, and two scales in Cauthorne’s home. But the ensuing investigation found peculiarities with the evidence that precluded Cauthorne from being charged with even a misdemeanor. There was no record of where exactly in the home the drugs had been found, for example, and police told crime lab technicians not to photograph the evidence. The officers who conducted the raid were also unavailable for interviews with investigators until days or weeks after the raid took place. Though never charged, Cauthorne served more than six weeks in jail before the charges against him were dismissed.445

• Officer Ron Jones. On December 26, 2001, police in Prentiss, Mississippi, served search warrants on two apartments in a duplex. One apartment was occupied by Jamie Smith, named in the warrant as a “known drug dealer.” The other was occupied by Cory Maye, who had no criminal record and wasn’t named in the warrants. At the time of the raid, Maye was asleep with his 18- month-old daughter. After attempting to enter through the front door, police moved to the back and broke down the door to Maye’s bedroom. Officer Ron Jones was the first police officer to enter. Maye, who says he feared for his life, fired three times, striking Jones once. Maye’s bullet hit Jones in the abdomen, just below his bulletproof vest. Jones died a short time later. Police found only traces of marijuana in Maye’s apartment, after first telling reporters they’d found no drugs at all. Officer Jones was the only officer who conducted the investigation leading up to the raid and apparently kept no notes of his investigation. According to the district attorney and prosecutor in the Maye case, all evidence of the investigation leading to the raid on Maye’s home “died with Officer Jones.”446 In January 2004, Maye was convicted of capital murder for the death of Jones and sentenced to die by lethal injection.447

• Deputy Keith Ruiz. On February 15, 2001, police raided the Del Valle, Texas, mobile home of Edwin Delamora, where he lived with his wife and two children. As two deputies beat down his door with a battering ram, Delamora fired, fearing he was under attack. One bullet from his gun struck and killed sheriff’s deputy Keith Ruiz. Delamora had no previous criminal record and his defense attorney says the raid on his home was influenced by an anonymous informant who turned out to be the brother of two sheriff’s deputies. Information about the informant’s relationship with the police was suppressed at trial. Delamora was eventually convicted of capital murder and sentenced to life in prison. Police found less than an ounce of methamphetamine and one ounce of marijuana in his home. Prosecutors declined to seek the death penalty because of substantial doubt over whether Delamora knew the officers were police or whether he genuinely believed them to be intruders.448

• Deputies James Moulson and Philip Anderson; George Timothy Williams. On January 3, 2001, Jerome County, Idaho, sheriff’s deputies James Moulson and Phillip Anderson conducted a raid on the home of George Timothy Williams. The warrant for the raid contained information from a confidential informant asserting that Williams was one of the leading suppliers of marijuana in the county. Moulson and Anderson conducted the raid at night, wearing camouflage. It’s unclear whether they announced themselves before entering. Williams fired when the deputies entered, and the deputies returned fire. All three died in the shootout. A subsequent search turned up less than four grams of marijuana. Lawsuits brought by the families of both slain deputies and by Williams’s family revealed that the informant was a woman who lived with Williams. One suit alleges that the sheriff’s department threatened to take away the woman’s child if she didn’t give them the information they needed to get the warrant. The county settled with the family of one deputy.449 A federal court dismissed the lawsuit brought by Williams’s family. An Idaho state police investigation found no wrongdoing on the part of the sheriff’s department or the deputies who conducted the raid.450

•Officer David Eales.On September 24, 1999, police in Sallisaw, Oklahoma, procured a no-knock warrant on the home of Eugene Barrett, suspected of trafficking methamphetamine. As the police vehicles descended upon his home, Barrett opened fire. One bullet struck and killed Oklahoma Highway Patrol Officer David Eales. Barrett claims he was acting in self defense. After a state jury declined to give Barrett the death penalty, he was tried again in federal court, convicted, and sentenced to death.451

• The Mary Lou Coonfield Raid. In August 1996, Tulsa police raided the home of 70-year-old Mary Lou Coonfield on a drug warrant. Coonfield awoke to find a man in black standing in her bedroom, holding a gun. She grabbed a .22- caliber pistol and fired, wounding Tulsa County Deputy Sheriff Newt Ellenbarger. The warrant for Coonfield was later thrown out, ruled in both 1996 and 1997 to be illegal. In 1999, a jury acquitted Coonfield of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and feloniously pointing a weapon. Coonfield was acquitted because of Oklahoma’s “Make My Day” law, which states that “an occupant of a house is justified in using physical force, including deadly force, against another person who has unlawfully entered the house if the occupant reasonably believes that the other person might use any physical force, no matter how slight, against any occupant of the house.” Coonfield, who’s both hard of hearing and has poor eyesight, says she didn’t hear police announce themselves before entering, and thought she was being robbed.452

• Officer James Jensen. On March 13, 1996, the Oxnard, California, SWAT team conducted an early morning drug raid on a home that turned out to be unoccupied. In the maze of smoke and light that followed the deployment of a flashbang grenade, a fellow SWAT team member, who would later reveal that his judgment was clouded by Vicodin, mistook Officer James Jensen for a hostile occupant of the house and shot him dead. Jensen’s family won a $3.5 million settlement from the city of Oxnard in 1999.453

• The Andre Madison Raid.On November 7, 1995, police in North Minneapolis, Minnesota, raided the home of Andre Madison. After local media merely recounted the police version of events, Minneapolis City Pages conducted an indepth investigation. According to the paper’s account, police obtained a noknock warrant on Madison’s home after a confidential informant allegedly purchased some marijuana at the residence.454 At about 8 p.m., the Minneapolis paramilitary unit, called ERU, deployed flashbang grenades at the front of Madison’s home. At the same time, police from the city’s housing unit were entering the home from the rear. Reports at the time say police began firing when Madison fired his shotgun at them. But a forensics team later determined that Madison’s gun was never fired the night of the raid. Instead, an investigation conducted by a police chief from a nearby county speculated that the housing unit officers mistook the flashbang grenades deployed by the ERU unit for gunfire from the suspect and opened fire themselves. The two police units then mistook one another for assailants and began to fire upon one another. When Officer Mark Lanasa went down, shot in the neck by a colleague, the commanding officer called for “suppressive fire,” giving officers carte blanche to shoot at will. Upon hearing that a fellow officer had gone down, more police soon arrived at the scene. They too joined in the shooting. Hundreds of rounds were fired into the building. There were bullet holes found in neighboring buildings, as well. Madison, the suspect, was shot in the neck and the arm. Miraculously, no one was killed.455 Police found only a small amount of marijuana in Madison’s home. He was never charged with a drug crime. He was charged with four felony counts of second-degree assault with a firearm—not for shooting, but for pointing his shotgun at police. He could have been sentenced to 12 years in prison. Madison insists he thought the police were intruders. Prosecutors then offered to let Madison plead to a misdemeanor count of reckless use of a firearm, which carries a sentence of just 90 days. The hitch was that a guilty plea to the lesser charge would have prevented Madison from suing the city. The subsequent investigation and report from the outside police chief concluded that Minneapolis’s ERU unit “executes too many warrants and relies too heavily on dynamic (door-ramming) raids,” explaining that “there are other alternative tactics that ERU is aware of. However when so many raids are conducted using dynamic entry, other tactics may be forgotten.”456 Confronting Nonviolent Offenders with Violent Tactics Drug war supporters and casual observers often find it difficult to criticize paramilitary raids ending in the death or injury of nonviolent drug users or dealers, noting that those people are, after all, breaking the law. If drugs are found at the scene, even raids ending in a suspect’s death are somehow deemed less troubling than raids ending in the deaths of innocents. The case against the suspect and in favor of the decision to raid with a paramilitary unit seems to grow stronger if the suspect also possesses weapons, or worse, points them at or attempts to use them against the raiding police officers. Perhaps it’s true that such scenarios shouldn’t trouble us as much as raids on the homes of innocents. But they’re still troubling, for two reasons. First, by some estimates, more than 96 million Americans have consumed marijuana at some point in their lives.457 The overwhelming majority of them have done so peacefully and at the expense of no one else. Legalizing marijuana is a debate for another time. But it would be absurd to suggest that the 96 million Americans who have tried or continue to smoke marijuana have effectively given up their Fourth Amendment rights. Smoking marijuana, or even selling it to someone else, isn’t a violent crime and, consequently, doesn’t merit a home invasion by police armed with the weaponry and mindset of soldiers. It certainly doesn’t merit death. Yet a troublingly high number of these raids are aimed at marijuana offenders. Second, as discussed earlier, given the tactics associated with no-knock warrants, it isn’t difficult to see why people might grab weapons to defend themselves and their families when police violently storm a home late at night or just before dawn. That a suspect pointed a weapon at police serving a noknock warrant doesn’t prove that the suspect was violent or a threat to the public. It only proves that someone in the privacy of his own home was understandably threatened by the presence of armed intruders. The fact that police find weapons or marijuana at the scene of a raid, then, still doesn’t mean paramilitary tactics and forced entry were justified. It’s possible—likely, even—that millions of Americans are both harmless recreational marijuana users and legal gun owners. The presence of both doesn’t make them a threat to the community. And the only legitimate use of paramilitary units like SWAT teams, indeed the reason they were originally implemented, is to deal with real, immediate, and obvious threats to the public safety. Perhaps the best example of how such violent tactics unleashed on nonviolent drug users invite tragedy is the case of Clayton Helriggle. Clayton Helriggle. Helriggle, 23, lived in a house with four roommates in West Alexandria, Ohio. In September 2002, a local SWAT team conducted a no-knock raid on the house. Local police had only recently put the SWAT team together—the most experienced members of the team had less than four hours of tactical training. Others had never trained with the SWAT team before. A postraid report would later find that “wrong dates were used in an affidavit, and investigators questioned why so little time was provided for surveillance of the house and why there were no controlled narcotic purchases from the house.”458According to the Dayton Daily News, the search warrant was “largely based on overheard conversations, a few hours of surveillance, and the word of a convicted felon who had recently lied to a court to remain free on bond.” Informant Kevin Leitch insisted there were “pounds and pounds” of marijuana at the residence and specifically identified Helriggle as a dealer. Leitch later told investigators he was mistaken. Helriggle’s family says he was a recreational marijuana smoker, though not a dealer.459 On September 27, 2002, 25–30 police officers emerged from nearby woods and swarmed the farmhouse. SWAT officers detonated several flashbang grenades on the first floor, then used a battering ram to force their way into the rented farmhouse. As police in shields and body armor subdued three of the house’s occupants, Helriggle, asleep in an upstairs bedroom, was awakened by the commotion and descended the stairs. Police at the scene say he was carrying a handgun at the time. Helriggle’s roommates insist that while Helriggle did own a licensed handgun, he’d left it in the bedroom and was holding a blue cup of water. Whatever Helriggle was holding, his last words—“What’s going on?”—indicate he wasn’t aware that the armed intruders in his home were police. A SWAT team member interpreted the item in his hand to be a gun and put a single shotgun blast into Helriggle’s chest. He died at the scene, in the arms of one of his roommates.460 Immediately after the raid, police told local reporters that they’d found marijuana, pills, weapons, drug paraphernalia, and drug “packaging materials” at the home. The pills proved to be a bottle of prescribed codeine. The weapons were Helriggle’s legal handgun, an old shotgun, and a .22-caliber rifle, not particularly unusual for an Ohio farmhouse. The “packaging materials” turned out to be a box of sandwich bags. And police found less than an ounce of marijuana. No charges were filed against any of the house’s occupants.461 In addition to the tip from an unreliable informant, police raided the farmhouse on the basis of evidence they say they collected while conducting surveillance. As it turns out, that evidence too was questionable. Officer George Petitt, who both conducted the surveillance and planned the raid, told investigators he concluded the farmhouse was a “dope house, just by the activity” of cars pulling in and out of the driveway. But when pressed, he conceded that he had no firsthand knowledge of a single marijuana deal that took place at the farmhouse.462 The absurdity of using a highly armed, poorly trained SWAT team to carry out a violent, volatile raid on a house rented by recreational marijuana users was captured by Ian Albert, a resident of the farmhouse who also happened to have just completed Navy SEAL training. It was Albert who held Helriggle in his arms as he bled to death. According to the Dayton Daily News Albert’s first thought at the time was “Wow, they took down a farm of unarmed hippies.” “If they would have come to the door and said, ‘Give us your dope, hippies,’” he added, “we’d have gotten about a $100 ticket.”463 A grand jury and internal investigation later found no criminal wrongdoing on the part of police officers but did find the SWAT team “ill prepared” and “lack[ing] experience in dangerous searches.”464 The grand jury report also noted that the officers who conducted the raid had refused to cooperate with investigators.465 In January 2004, Greene County, Ohio, prosecutor Bill Schenk suggested the possibility of reopening the Helriggle case, saying that he was concerned that Helriggle had been publicly portrayed as a drug dealer. “I think it’s fair to say that there was no drug dealing by Mr. Helriggle,” he told the Dayton Daily News. 466 Despite the fact that he was at the time awaiting sentencing for more than a dozen crimes, including forgery, theft, burglary, breaking and entering, and safecracking, informant Kevin Leitch was never charged for lying to police officers, nor was he charged for lying under oath to the grand jury investigating the raid.467 These kinds of cases are increasingly common. It’s now routine for police to deploy SWAT teams to serve search warrants on nonviolent marijuana suspects for crimes that in many cases barely qualify as misdemeanors. These unnecessari-ly violent and confrontational tactics are, also, increasingly bearing tragic results. Some examples:

• Leesburg, Virginia. In January 2006, police in Leesburg used flashbang grenades while raiding the home of a marijuana suspect. Police obtained the warrant after sifting through trash bags outside the house. They found one small bag of marijuana.468

• Decatur, Alabama. In October 2005, police in Decatur raided a family home on a marijuana warrant. Police shot and killed two of the family’s dogs and, according to the targets of the raid, made jokes about the dead pets while the suspects were in custody. Police seized eight grams of marijuana, or about enough to fill a ketchup packet.469

• Shannon Hills, Arkansas. In February 2005, police in Shannon Hills stormed a home with their guns drawn during a toddler’s birthday party. The target was a pregnant woman attending the party. Police arrested her on suspicion of distributing marijuana. Police Chief Richard Friend told one reporter, referencing the birthday, “We got them something they wish they could return.”470

• Angela King. On May 17, 2004, Perry County, Kentucky, police raided the home of Dennis Ray and Angela King on suspicion of marijuana distribution. Deputy Sheriff John Couch shot Angela King twice, once in the head, in the course of the raid. Police say King fired a weapon at them first, though the couple’s 14-year-old-son—also in the home at the time of the raid and who was subdued with a policeman’s foot on his shoulder—says he heard only two shots. The police were cleared of all wrongdoing in the shooting. Dennis Ray was arrested on charges of distributing marijuana.471

• Linda Florek.On December 7, 2004, at 10 p.m., police in Mundelein, Illinois, broke down the door to the home of 48- year-old Linda Florek. They then ordered Florek and her son to the floor and handcuffed them. Shortly into the raid, Florek—who has a cardiac condition—told police she was having chest pains, possibly a heart attack. According to a lawsuit later filed by Florek, police refused to let her take an aspirin or to call an ambulance. Ninety minutes later, the officers finally believed her and called an ambulance. Florek was eventually admitted to a hospital, where doctors determined she’d had a heart attack and needed immediate surgery. Police issued Florek a ticket and fine for the misdemeanor possession of less than 2.5 grams of marijuana.472

• Shay Neace. On March 22, 2003, police in SWAT attire raided a home in Canton, Ohio, on a marijuana warrant, looking for a man with a history of marijuana distribution. There was a party at the home that night. As the raid commenced, Officer William Watson of the Perry Township Police Department made his way to the home’s second floor, and pulled open the door to a bathroom. Inside, 24-year-old Shay Neace and his brother Seth were smoking marijuana. Watson pushed a gun through the door and ordered everyone in the bathroom to the floor. Neace and his brother say Watson never announced himself. They thought they were being robbed. Shay Neace grabbed Watson’s gun and pushed it away. He then pushed the gunman— Watson—out into the hall. At that point, Watson fired, hitting Neace in the shoulder and in the back. The second shot left Neace paralyzed. Officer Watson was cleared of all charges by a grand jury. Neace was indicted by a separate grand jury, then acquitted in a criminal trial of obstructing an investigation and resisting arrest. Neace’s civil suit against Watson is still pending.473

• Robert Filgo. On September 2, 2003, police in Fremont, California, forced open the door of 41-year-old marijuana patient Robert Filgo, who had both a doctor’s prescription and a certificate from the city of Oakland permitting him to possess the drug. Police entered, forced Filgo to the floor at gunpoint, then shot his pet Akita nine times, killing it. The Alameda County District Attorney’s Office later declined to press charges against Filgo.474

• Marcella Monroe and Tam Davage.In October 2002, police in Eugene, Oregon, assembled a massive show of force—52 police officers from four agencies in full SWAT attire, assault weapons, shotguns, and an armored vehicle borrowed from the Oregon National Guard—to conduct a raid on three homes in the Whitaker neighborhood they suspected of growing marijuana. All three homes were owned by one couple, Marcella Monroe and Tam Davage. Davage and Monroe lived in one of the homes, with two tenants. They were renovating the other two houses, which had been destroyed in a windstorm. Police officers were aware that there were likely to be only three or four people at most in the three homes, despite the force of 52 officers they brought for the raid.475 The massive SWAT team was dressed in black or in camouflage and wore ski masks. They deployed flashbang grenades, then forced entry into the home occupied by Davage, Monroe, and their tenants without announcing themselves. They pulled the two couples out of bed and wrestled them to the ground. They put assault weapons to residents’ heads, tightly handcuffed them, and refused to let the two women, who were partially nude, cover themselves (they also took photos of the women before allowing them to dress).476 When Monroe asked if she could put on some clothing, one officer put a black bag over her head and tightened it around her neck. Because police at that point had still failed to identify themselves, Monroe says she believed she was about to be executed (as for the black bag tactic, the Eugene Police Department had been warned to discontinue the practice by the National Tactical Officers Association, who cautioned that “this practice is not acceptable in the law enforcement community,” that it “has no lawful purpose,” and though it is commonly used in military operations, “it has no place in civilian operations”).477 Monroe also sustained a cut on her head after one officer pushed her to the ground and put a boot on the back of her neck.478 Police found no plants, no weapons, and only “residue” of marijuana in a couple of plastic bags, for which the couple’s tenant was issued a misdemeanor citation. Neither Monroe nor Davage had a criminal record, and none of the occupants had any history of violent crime.479 Nevertheless, police still charged Davage and Monroe with felony manufacture of a controlled substance. They cited the evidence they’d found: fans, fluorescent lights, plastic sheeting, timers, potting equipment, sandwich bags, a scale, 24 electrical outlets, and a shop vacuum. Of course, none of those items is illegal, and in the case of Davage and Monroe, all were perfectly sensible to have around: Davage was a work-athome jeweler, explaining the lights and the outlets. Monroe owned a landscaping business, explaining the potting supplies and vacuum. Of course, as noted, the two were also renovating all three houses, as police could have easily ascertained, both during the raid and during the undercover visit one officer paid to the couple (posing as a potential tenant) before securing a warrant for the raid.480 Monroe had come to the attention of police when they’d busted a marijuana growing operation in Portland, where they found cashier’s checks made payable to her. What the officer failed to mention in the affidavit, however, was that the checks were clearly identified as payment for landscaping services and were made in the name of Monroe’s business. The most recent check was dated 1997, five years before the raid.481 In a subsequent lawsuit, Monroe and Davage outlined a host of other misleading assertions and questionable omissions in the affidavit that led to the raid on their home. The officer, for example, cites unusually the high use of electricity, the presence of potting soil, an electrical cord, and a “humming noise,” as grounds to suspect cultivation of marijuana. The affidavit never mentioned Monroe’s landscaping business, Davage’s jewelry business, or the fact that the couple was repairing their home from storm damage, though the officer was aware of all three. The affidavit also makes no mention of the possibility of weapons, disposability of evidence, or violent tendencies of any of the home’s occupants, all of which would have been required to justify a no-knock raid.482 Police defended the raid as entirely necessary and appropriate, given the well-known danger posed by people who grow marijuana. The spokesman for one of the task forces involved in the raid added that “the community at large” approved of such tactics. The Whitaker Community Council later condemned the raid at a public neighborhood meeting, as well as in a press release.483

• Jeffery Robinson. On July 30, 2002, police stormed the home of Jeffery Robinson, a 41-year-old gravedigger in South Memphis, Tennessee. Robinson lived in a small building on the site of the cemetery that employed him. Police conducted the raid on the basis of an anonymous tip that someone was selling marijuana on the cemetery grounds. Raiding officers kicked in Robinson’s bedroom door and immediately shot Robinson in the neck. Robinson died three weeks later. Police say Robinson charged them with a box cutter. They also found a small amount of marijuana near a camper in Robinson’s backyard and charged him with possession, even as he lay in a hospital fighting for his life. A review by the Memphis police department’s internal affairs unit and the Attorney General’s Office found no wrongdoing on the part of the police. For two and a half years, the officers who participated in that raid remained on the Memphis police force. But in October of 2004, the jury in a federal civil suit brought by Robinson’s family made some striking findings: The jury concluded that the box cutter police say Robinson charged them with—which was never fingerprinted— was planted on Robinson after the raid. During the trial, a medical examiner and blood spatter expert also testified that the shooting couldn’t possibly have happened the way the officers say it did. Further, the shirt Robinson wore, as well as the shirt of the officer who shot him, vanished after the raid. Trial testimony revealed that police bought a new polo shirt, still in its wrapper, and tagged it as the shirt Robinson wore the night he was shot. The federal jury concluded that the officers shot Robinson without justification, then tampered with the evidence to cover up their mistakes. The jury also cast doubt on the ensuing investigation by the police department’s internal affairs division.484 In February 2005, the eight officers involved in the raid were finally suspended, more than two years after the raid.485 Robinson’s family won a $2.85 million verdict against the officers and negotiated a $1 million settlement from the city of Memphis.486

• Vernard Davis.In January 2001, police in Rochester, New York, conducted a late-night drug raid at the home of Vernard Davis. During the raid, Officer David Gebhardt’s shotgun accidentally discharged as he stumbled through a dark room. The blast hit Davis in the chest, killing him. Davis left behind two toddlers and one six-year-old. Police did find a significant amount of drugs in the room, but no weapons. In 2004, the city of Rochester awarded Davis’s children a $300,000 settlement. The presiding judge called the shooting “a tragic, unintended accident.”487

• Jacqueline Paasch. In early 2000, a SWAT team from the Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, sheriff’s department broke into the home of Jacqueline Paasch and her two brothers on a no-knock drug warrant for suspicion of marijuana possession. Paasch says she heard footsteps rumbling up the stairs, but before she could figure out what was happening, her door was kicked in, a gun went off, and she was on the floor, bleeding. Paasch was hit in the leg, incurred $19,000 in medical expenses, endured a year of rehabilitation, and was told she’ll always walk with a limp. Police found a “very small amount of marijuana and a pipe” in the house, according to local news reports, though not enough to press charges against anyone in the house. In 2000, Paasch settled with the Village of West Milwaukee for $700,000. “The fact that this can happen to me and my family has made me realize that it can happen to anyone,” Paasch told one media outlet. “And that’s really frightening because the police are the ones you’re supposed to count on to protect you.”488

• Troy Davis. On December 15, 1999, police in North Richland Hills, Texas, raided the home of Troy Davis, the son of a well-known “true crime” writer. The raid was based on the word of a single, anonymous informant that Davis was growing marijuana in one of the house’s closets. That informant turned out to be Davis’s uncle, who had tipped off police after a long-running dispute with Davis’s mother. A local municipal judge had originally denied Sgt. Andy Wallace’s initial attempt to obtain the no-knock warrant, citing insufficient evidence. So Wallace merely went to a second judge in Fort Worth and got his approval. On the night of the raid one team pried open (with some difficulty) Davis’s back door, while another team went around to the front. According to police, Davis came to investigate the noises outside his home while carrying a gun (his family denies he was holding a weapon). Upon seeing the gun, raiding officers shot Davis in the chest, killing him. According to officers at the scene, Davis’s last words were, “I didn’t know. I didn’t know.” Though police did find three marijuana plants, GHB, and a few small bags of marijuana in Davis’s home, ensuing investigations revealed significant problems in the way Richland Hills police executed the search warrant. In fact, further investigation found flaws in the way the same police department conducted nearly all of its drug raids. First, attorneys for the Davis family found that the police department had a policy of conducting no-knock raids for every narcotics search warrant issued, a clear violation of the Supreme Court’s ruling in Richards. Second, according to the Ft. Worth Star-Telegram, “A year before the [Davis raid], two of the team’s members told superiors they were concerned that lax standards for the unit could leave it vulnerable to lawsuits.” Team leader Joe Walley later told a court that he was “very uncomfortable” about the Davis raid and that he felt the team was “doing a tactical operation without anything to go on.” Another officer came back from sniper school and told superiors that nearly everything the North Richland Hills SWAT team was doing was wrong. Yet another later said in a deposition of the Davis raid, “We should never have been there.” According to court records reviewed by the StarTelegram, Sergeant Wallace did little corroborating investigation after getting the tip from Davis’s uncle. There were no controlled buys or surveillance.489 After the Davis raid, the two officers who had warned superiors about inadequacies with the SWAT team were suspended. Another officer who told the media and the Davis family attorneys about his concerns quit five months after the raid, citing harassment by superiors. Two other officers who were forthcoming with criticism of the police department also quit.490 In 2004, a state appeals court ruled the warrant for the raid that killed Davis was invalid. The court found that the warrant failed to show that the informant for the raid was reliable, and that Sgt. Wallace failed to do any independent investigation to corroborate the informant’s tips.491 Even after the raid and ensuing revelations about poor training and preparation, North Richland Hills officials couldn’t or wouldn’t say what changes police had implemented to be sure a similar mistake wouldn’t occur again. The Forth Worth Star-Telegram reported that in 2005, during depositions for the civil suit brought by Davis’s family, responses from city officials indicated that raid procedures were never examined after the raid. Attorney Mark Haney, representing the Davis family, expressed frustration that no one from the city would claim responsibility for overseeing police procedures. “Is there anybody? . . . Who is it? Who can talk about this topic?” he asked of North Richland Hills city attorney Greg Staples. Staples replied, “That’s not my problem. That’s your problem.”492 The mayor of North Richland Hills testified that neither he nor the city council were responsible for oversight of the city’s police department. The city manager testified that he oversaw hiring and firing but that police procedures were determined by the police chief. The police chief said he answered to the city manager. When Haney asked the city manger if he had ordered any investigation into the death of Davis, he replied, “No I did not.” When asked if he had knowledge of any subsequent city investigation, he answered, “I’m not aware of any.”493

•Linda Elsea.Elsea smoked marijuana to treat her fibromylagia after the successful campaign for Initiative 692, a Washington State measure authorizing the use of cannabis for medical purposes. In 1999, she came out of the bathroom to find a team of SWAT soldiers armed with assault weapons barreling up her driveway. She was handcuffed, subject to a body cavity search, and taken to the police station.494

• Rusty Windle.In early 1999 in Wimberly, Texas, a paid police informant and former felon befriended electrician’s assistant Alexander “Rusty” Windle after meeting him at a bar frequented by tradesmen. The informant had been working the area for more than four months, winning friends by throwing parties stocked with beer and food. The informant convinced Windle to get him two half-ounce bags of marijuana, the Texas minimum for a felony charge. When Windle delivered, police obtained an arrest warrant. One witness said of the informant, “He asked everybody to get him pot, he practically begged you for it.”495 On May 17, 1999, nine police officers conducted a pre-dawn raid on Windle’s home. Officer accounts differ on whether or not they announced they were police, though the other targets of raids that night (based on information gathered from the same informant) say police never announced themselves before executing the warrants. The police who raided Windle’s home were dressed entirely in black. Windle awoke, and came to the door with a gun. Police say that when they heard the slide action of a rifle bolt, Officer Chase Strapp backed away from the door. As he did, he tripped over a potted plant. Seeing armed men in black approaching his house, and watching one retreat from his porch, Windle pointed his weapon at Strapp. Strapp fired four rounds, hitting Windle three times, killing him. Police found less than an ounce of marijuana in Windle’s home.496

•Lisa Swartz and the Medical Marijuana Raids.In August 2004, 38 medical marijuana patients filed simultaneous lawsuits against state law enforcement agencies in California for seizing marijuana from their homes in violation of state law. One of them was Lisa Swartz, who described a raid on her home to the online publication AlterNet: During the conference call, she told of being raided at gunpoint in 1999. “They came with a narc SWAT team, pointing semi-automatic weapons at my grandkids’ heads,” she said before breaking into tears. “It was a terrible experience and totally changed my view of everything. I used to believe the police were there to protect and defend us. It is just so bizarre that they do this to people,” said Swartz. “Even if we get our property back, this still takes a terrible toll on our families.” Swartz spent 18 months and $50,000 on her defense before authorities dropped the charges. “They never apologized and they never gave me my medicine back,” she said.497

• Willie Heard. On February 13, 1999, police in Osawatomie, Kansas, conducted a 1:30 a.m. raid on the home of 46- year-old Willie Heard. Police say they announced themselves, though Heard’s daughter, who was home at the time, told the Topeka Capital-Journal, “[A]ll I heard them say was ‘Get Down! Freeze!’” Heard awoke, and met officers in his bedroom with a .22-caliber rifle. Seeing the gun, a raiding officer opened fire and shot Heard dead. Though the search warrant was for crack cocaine and related paraphernalia, police found only the burnt remnants of an herb that couldn’t be tested. If it had been marijuana, it would have barely been enough for two cigarettes.498 Prosecutors declined to press charges against the police who conducted the raid.499 In 2001, Heard’s family won a $3.5 million settlement from Miami County and the cities of Osawatomie and Paola. The lawsuit contended that police had targeted the wrong home. At least one member of the SWAT team later apologized to Heard’s family for their mistakes.500

• David Doran.In August 1998, police in Kansas City, Missouri, conducted a noknock raid on the home of David Doran on suspicion that he was dealing methamphetamine. Doran says he was asleep when police entered and that because he thought he was being robbed, he came out of his bedroom holding a gun. Police say Doran didn’t comply with orders to get down. Doran says he tried to surrender. Raiding officers shot Doran, inflicting injuries that required a two-week hospital stay and the loss of his only functioning kidney. A jury subsequently awarded Doran $2 million, but in June 2005 the Eighth Circuit Federal Appeals Court overturned the award, concluding that police were justified in conducting a no-knock raid on Doran’s home. Police found no methamphetamine, nor did they find any evidence that Doran had ever operated a methamphetamine lab. They did find a small amount of marijuana.501

• Michael Swimmer. In the summer of 1998, police in Orange County, Florida, shot and killed 27-year-old Michael Swimmer in a 2:30 a.m. drug raid. Police shot Swimmer six times after he confronted the raiding SWAT team with a handgun. Police conducted the raid after a tip from a confidential informant that Swimmer, an amateur bodybuilder, was selling ecstasy.502

• Chinue Tao Hashim. On February 21, 1998, a deputy in Greenville County, South Carolina, shot and killed unarmed drug suspect Chinue Tao Hashim during a SWAT raid. While negotiating a drug deal with Hashim, one undercover officer said over the radio that “a gun is on the table,” meaning that a gun was part of the bargain. When the SWAT team raided, Master Deputy John Eldridge interpreted the radio remark about the gun to mean that Hashim was armed. As the raid commenced, Eldridge thought he saw Hashim reaching for a gun and opened fire. A subsequent investigation revealed that what Eldridge thought was a gun was actually the glint from a wristwatch.503 Prosecutors declined to press charges against Eldridge.504

• Barry Hodge. On August 4, 1997, police in Selmer, Tennessee, broke down the door to the home of Barry and Sheila Hodge on a no-knock drug raid. According to a $25 million lawsuit filed by Hodge’s widow in 1998, police never announced themselves before entering. By the time the raid was over police had shot Barry Hodge in the arm and chest, killing him. Sheila Hodge claims she was thrown to the floor and handcuffed, and the Hodge’s daughter was locked in her bedroom. Press accounts don’t say if police found marijuana in the home.505

• Richard Paey. In March 1997, police in Pasco County, Florida, arrested Richard Paey on charges of prescription fraud. Paey, a multiple sclerosis patient suffering from the effects of a car accident and subsequent botched back surgery, is wheelchair-bound and paraplegic. His various ailments required him to take significant quantities of painkillers to lead a normal life. Unfortunately, Florida law made it difficult for him to get the medication he needed. Prosecutors accused Paey of forging prescriptions, though they conceded that there’s no evidence he was selling or distributing. Despite Paey’s condition, and the fact that he obviously posed no threat to anyone, prosecutors sent a SWAT team to arrest him. Officers in ski masks and body armor, armed with assault weapons, broke down the door to Paey’s home, needlessly terrorizing him, his wife, and their children.506

• Doug Carpenter and Carlos LeBron. On January 11, 1996, a SWAT team in Maitland, Florida, used a 60-pound steel ram to break down the door to the apartment of Doug Carpenter and his roommate, Carlos LeBron. Police conducted the raid after a member of Maitland’s police “New Resident Visitation Team” came to their apartment shortly after the two had moved in and noticed “a strong odor of what he believed to be cannabis.” The two men were handcuffed at gunpoint for three hours while police searched their apartment. The search turned up 3.5 grams of marijuana, and earned each a $150 fine. Police didn’t suspect either man of dealing marijuana, nor were there any complaints from neighbors. Maitland police chief Ed Doyle said the warrant was executed because the two men were new to the area and were renters, which together present “a potential problem to be nipped in the bud.” Doyle added that the raid wasn’t “one we’re going to put on the mantle.”507 Other Incidents of Paramilitary Excess Finally, there are several examples from the past decade in which SWAT teams and paramilitary tactics have been used unnecessarily and recklessly, but that defy easy categorization. Here are a few of those incidents:

• The Utah Rave Raid. In August 2005, more than 90 police officers from sever-al state and local SWAT teams raided a peaceful outdoor dance party in Utah attended by 1,500 people. Police were armed with assault weapons, full-SWAT attire, police dogs, and tear gas. Many in attendance say police beat, abused, and swore at partygoers. Police deny the allegations, though amateur video audio clearly captures police issuing orders laced with profanity. Police also arrested security guards on drug possession charges, though the guards possessed the drugs because they’d confiscated them from partygoers.508

• The Easton, Pennsylvania, SWAT Team. The small town of Easton, Pennsylvania, chose to disband its SWAT team in 2005 after a series of incidents, including the shooting death of one SWAT team member. An editorial in the Allentown Morning Call praised the decision, noting that the SWAT team had become “rude, arrogant, and disrespectful,” and had “lost the confidence of the civilians who supervise them and sign their paychecks.”509

• The Ahwatukee Raid.In 2004, police in Ahwatukee, Arizona, conducted a massively armed, thoroughly bumbling raid on a home they suspected contained illegal assault weapons and ammunition. In a densely populated, upscale neighborhood, a SWAT team from the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Department, complete with an armored personnel carrier, used grenade launchers to fire at least four rounds of tear gas into the windows of the home. The home then caught fire. As the owners of the home evacuated, police officers actually chased the family’s dog back into the burning house with a fire extinguisher, where it perished in the flames. Andrea Baker, the dog’s owner, says police laughed as she cried at their cruelty. Later, the brakes would fail on the SWAT team’s armored personnel carrier, causing it to lurch down the street and smash into a parked car. The car was owned by Julie Madrigal, who had fled the car just moments earlier with her nine-year-old daughter after the two grew frightened at the sight of the SWAT team as it fired canisters of tear gas. The fire completely destroyed the home, putting homes nearby in the dense neighborhood at risk, too. For all of this, police found no assault weapons. They found only an antique shotgun and a 9-millimeter pistol, both of which were legally owned. They still arrested 26-yearold Erik Kush, on outstanding traffic violations.510 CBS News reported in 1997 that the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Department’s SWAT team was doing an average of one callout per week. In an on-camera interview, one member of the team told reporter Jim Stewart the best part of being on the SWAT team was that, “you get to play with a lot of guns. That’s what’s fun. You know, everybody on this teams is— you know, loves guns.” Another added, “Hey, the bottom line is it’s friggin’ fun, man. That’s the deal. Nobody wants to take burglary reports.”511

• The Racine Rave Raid. In 2002, police in Racine, Wisconsin, conducted an early-morning raid on a rave dance party, kicking in doors, dragging young people from bathroom stalls, throwing others to the floor, and holding them all at gunpoint. Police issued more than 450 citations to partygoers for merely attending a party where some drugs were present, but made only 3 arrests. The city of Racine later dismissed nearly all of the charges but still faces a civil lawsuit from attendees who claim police violated their civil rights.512

• The Farmerville Raids. In 2002, 40 police offices from more than 10 different agencies conducted a pre-dawn raid on a suspected drug hub in Farmerville, Louisiana, in what one local sheriff called “a dream come true.” The raid did yield ten arrests, but the violent tactics enraged the local community. Around 100 people marched through the small town the next day to protest the operation, in which police forced entry into several homes. “They could have arrested them any time and any day,” protest organizer Sheila Lewis told the Associated Press. “They are not violent, they are just normal people. . . . It was like a war zone. People were scared to death.”513

• The Colorado–Colorado State Football Game.In 1999, a SWAT team took the field when rowdy fans attempted to bring down the goalposts—a tradition in college football—after a Colorado State– Colorado football game. Armed with weapons and mace, police roughed up dozens of fans for 30 minutes after the game, including Colorado State student Britney Michalski, who nearly died after an allergic reaction to the mace. When one of Michalski’s friends attempted to get aid for her from one of the police, she too was maced.514

• “Operation Jump Start.” In 1997, a multitude of police officers from three separate SWAT teams conducted a massive raid on multiple low-income neighborhoods in New Britain, Connecticut.

A state trooper flew above the scene in a small Cessna aircraft, keeping in radio contact with commanders on the ground. The state troops swept onto city streets inside “Peacekeepers,” trucks with battering rams in the front.515 “Operation Jump Start” netted 49 arrests.516

• Ramon Gallardo.In 1997, a SWAT team from Dinuba, California, a town with just 12 regular police officers and 15,000 people and which hadn’t a single reported homicide in its history, shot and killed 64- year-old farm worker Ramon Gallardo.517 Officers in black masks broke down Gallardo’s bedroom door while he and his wife were sleeping. Carmen Gallardo told the Los Angeles Timesshe thought the police “were robbers” when they entered. According to police, Gallardo reached for a folding knife to defend himself, though his family says Gallardo didn’t own the knife. Gallardo was shot 12 times. Gallardo had no criminal history. Police were looking for a stolen gun they say was in the possession of Gallardo’s son. The gun was never found. A subsequent investigation by the Tulare County district attorney found no improper behavior on the part of police. A federal jury later ordered the town of Dinuba to pay the Gallardo family $12.5 million in compensation. Dinuba later dissolved its SWAT team.518

• The Heflin Family. In 1996, a SWAT team in La Plata County, Colorado, descended on a ranch owned by Samuel Heflin. They were looking for evidence related to a bar brawl—a cowboy hat, shirt, and a pack of cigarettes. On the way in to Heflin’s home, police forced two children to the ground at gunpoint. They then trained a laser-sighted assault weapon on Heflin’s four-year-old daughter as she ran screaming into the house. Upon asking to see a search warrant, Heflin was told by SWAT officers to “shut the fuck up.”519

• The Fitchburg SWAT Incidents. In 1996, the Fitchburg, Massachusetts, SWAT team burned down an apartment complex after deploying flashbang grenades in a no-knock raid. The fire left six police officers injured and 24 people homeless.520 In an article on the raid and fire, the Boston Globe noted the that the Fitchberg SWAT team was formed in 1990 with the charge, “To establish an organized response to unusual high-risk situations, barricaded suspects, hostage situations, and other similar life-threatening events where citizen safety or officer safety is at risk.”521 But the 1996 raid wasn’t the first time the unit had come under criticism. The team had a history of botched raids and faced at least one suit for violating the civil rights of a group of loiterers the SWAT team was called to break up.522",Radley Balko,1980,"[91, 74, 47, 41, 30, 30, 32, 34, 38, 41, 46, 53, 64, 74]",14

199,Under The Gun,"[Verse 1]
There came a time where everything was poison in my mind
Took everything I had until only fear was left behind
I tried to see it through cause they say that love is blind
We washed up on the rocks cause we were covering our eyes
I'm sick of waiting for a change of tide
Tired of blaming on an anxious mind
I've become jaded and I'm losing sight
I can't fake this, I said I loved you but I lied

You had me hooked, careless and cunning
You had your throne, but now you're nothing
You had me hooked, careless and cunning
You had your throne, but now you're nothing

And I'm leaving, send the orders for retreat
I laid to rest this war that we called ""love""
It's for the best and what's done is done
I'm leaving
It's for the best and what's done is done

[Verse 2]
But I'd be lying if I said it didn't kill me
Knowing I hurt you is what hurts the most
Lay awake all night barely breathing
From this casualty created on my own

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Stuck on an edge that wasn't cutting
So I let go and now there's nothing
Stuck on an edge that wasn't cutting
So I let go and now there's nothing
Nothing at all
And now there's nothing
Nothing at all
And now there's nothing

I let go when the love was lost
Tried to mend, but I paid the cost
I let go when the love was lost
Tried to mend, but I paid the cost

Our senses tingle to the touch oh how we hypnotize
Oh, to get the feeling on and on
Oh, just to get the feeling

Holding you closer in my arms
We drift to heaven bringing in the morning light
And after all is said and done
There's only us we can make it right
So, our love will carry on and on
Now, our love will be free, be free

And when we play, love don't delay, I hear you now
For what was then, is what is now, anyhow

Ive been bout my work but I'll always put you first, 
And I don’t know how, 
But I don’t need confirmation, 
And we could slow down, 
But we’ve passed all consternation
So I don’t wanna think bout, I should have a drink about it,

204,First...Be A Woman,"You can go to Harvard
You can be a pilot
You can be an astronaut
But first, be a woman, ooh ooh...
When you're walking down the street
Show your feminine appeal
Even tho' you're wearing jeans
It's important to be real
You were born to be yourself
So no matter how you feel
If you want to impress the opposite sex
When he takes you for a ride
Let him open you the door
When he asks you for a dance
Let him lead you to the floor
When he kisses you good night
You just leave him wanting more
You can do all you can
Say I am what I am
But first be a woman... oh oh oh oh
When he takes you out to dine
Don't you end up in his bed
Wedding bells will ring in time
Make him dream of you instead
And his passion can be like
All the stories that you've read
He can be Romeo if you act like Juliet
Nowadays it ends too soon
Even tho' it's just begun
You can take him to the moon
He'll leave with the morning sun
So take a lesson from the past
Make him want and make him run...
(You can't be a quarterback
He can't wear a pretty dress
You cannot be Superman
And he's not a shy princess
So why try to be alike
When it's only self defense ?
You've got grace, he's got style
And together you'll rhyme
So remember to be true
To the legend that you are
All the feminine in you
Has worked miracles so far
So head up high and don't be shy
You can reach for any star
You can do all you can...
Say I am what I am
You can be an executive

206,Empire Strikes Back (Medley),"THE AMERICAN ACADEMY of Emergency Medicine confirms it: Each year, between one and two dozen adult US males are admitted to ERs after having castrated themselves. With kitchen tools, usually, sometimes wire cutters. In answer to the obvious question, surviving patients most often report that their sexual urges had become a source of intolerable conflict and anxiety. The desire for perfect release and the real-world impossibility of perfect, whenever-you-want-it release had together produced a tension they could no longer stand.

It is to the 30+ testosteronically afflicted males whose cases have been documented in the past two years that your correspondents wish to dedicate this article. And to those tormented souls considering autocastration in 1998, we wish to say: “Stop! Stay your hand! Hold off with those kitchen utensils and/or wire cutters!” Because we believe we may have found an alternative.

Every spring, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presents awards for outstanding achievement in all aspects of mainstream cinema. These are the Academy Awards. Mainstream cinema is a major industry in the United States, and so are the Academy Awards. The AAs’ notorious commercialism and hypocrisy disgust many of the millions and millions and millions of viewers who tune in during prime time to watch the presentations. It is not a coincidence that the Oscars ceremony is held during TV’s Sweeps Week. We pretty much all tune in, despite the grotesquerie of watching an industry congratulate itself on its pretense that it’s still an art form, of hearing people in $5,000 gowns invoke lush clichés of surprise and humility scripted by publicists, etc.—the whole cynical postmodern deal—but we all still seem to watch. To care. Even though the hypocrisy hurts, even though opening grosses and marketing strategies are now bigger news than the movies themselves, even though Cannes and Sundance have become nothing more than enterprise zones. But the truth is that there’s no more real joy about it all anymore. Worse, there seems to be this enormous unspoken conspiracy where we all pretend that there’s still joy. That we think it’s funny when Bob Dole does a Visa ad and Gorbachev shills for Pizza Hut. That the whole mainstream celebrity culture is rushing to cash in and all the while congratulating itself on pretending not to cash in. Underneath it all, though, we know the whole thing sucks.

Your correspondents humbly offer an alternative.

Every January, the least pretentious city in America hosts the Annual AVN Awards. The AVN stands for Adult Video News, which is sort of the Variety of the US porn industry. This thick, beautifully designed magazine costs $7.95 per issue, is about 80 percent ads, and is clearly targeted at adult-video retailers. Its circulation is appr. 40,000.

Though the sub-line vagaries of entertainment accounting are legendary, it is universally acknowledged that the US adult-film industry, at $3.5-4 billion in annual sales, rentals, cable charges, and video-masturbation-booth revenues, is an even larger and more efficient moneymaking machine than legitimate mainstream American cinema (the latter’s annual gross commonly estimated at $2-2.5 billion). The US adult industry is centered in LA’s San Fernando Valley, just over the mountains from Hollywood.1 Some insiders like to refer to the adult industry as Hollywood’s Evil Twin, others as the mainstream’s Big Red Son.

It is no accident that Adult Video News—a slick, expensive periodical whose articles are really more like infomercials—and its yearly Awards both came into being in 1982. The early ’80s, after all, saw the genesis of VCRs and home-video rentals, which have done for the adult industry pretty much what TV did for pro football.

From the 12/11/97 press release issued by AVN (visitable also at www.avn.com):

- The nominations for the 15th Annual AVN Awards were announced today.2 This year’s awards show, commemorating AVN’s 15th anniversary, celebrates “History”. [sic]

- Awards will be presented in a record 106 categories over a two night period.

- The adult industry released nearly 8,000 adult releases [sic] in 1997, including over 4,000 “new” releases (non-compilation). AVN reviewed every new release in every categroy [sic] this past year, logging over 30,000 sex scenes.3

- By comparison, last year there were approximately 375 films eligible for the Academy Awards that these voters [sic—meaning different voters from the AVN voters, presumably] were required to see. AVN had to watch more than 10 times the amount of releases in order to develop these nominations [usage and repetition sic, though 4,000 divided by 375 is indeed over 10].

From the acceptance speech of Mr. Tom Byron, Saturday, 10 January 1998, Caesars Forum ballroom, Caesars Palace Hotel and Casino complex, Las Vegas NV, upon winning AVN’s 1998 Male Performer of the Year Award (and with no little feeling): “I want to thank every beautiful woman I ever put my cock inside.” [Laughter, cheers, ovation.]

From the acceptance speech of Ms. Jeanna Fine, ibid., upon winning AVN’s 1998 Best Supporting Actress Award for her role in Rob Black’s Miscreants: “Jesus, which one is this for, Miscreants? Jesus, that’s another one where I read the script and said ‘Oh shit, I am going to go to hell. [Laughter, cheers.] But that’s okay, ’cause all my friends’ll be there too!” [Huge wave of laughter, cheers, applause.]

From the inter-Award banter of Mr. Bobby Slayton, professional comedian and master of ceremonies for the 1997 AVNAs: “I know I’m looking good, though, like younger, ’cause I started using this special Grecian Formula—every time I find a gray hair, I fuck my wife in the ass. [No laughter, scattered groans.] Fuck you. That’s a great joke. Fuck you.”

Bobby Slayton, a gravelly-voiced Dice Clay knockoff who kept introducing every female performer as “the woman I’m going to cut my dick off for,” and who astounded all the marginal print journalists in attendance with both his unfunniness and his resemblance to every apartment-complex coke dealer we’d ever met, is mercifully absent from the 1998 Awards gala. The ’98 emcee is one Robert Schimmel, alumnus of In Living Color and a Howard Stern regular. Schimmel looks like a depraved, deeply tan Wallace Shawn and is no less coarse than B. Slayton but a lot better. He does a pantomime of someone attempting intercourse with a Love Doll he’s been too lazy to blow up all the way. He contrasts the woeful paucity of his own ejaculate with the concussive orgasms of certain well-known male performers,4 comparing these men’s ejaculations to automatic lawn sprinklers and doing an eerie sonic impression of same. All of 1998’s marginal print journalists are together at Table 189 at the very back of the ballroom. Most of these reporters are from the sorts of men’s magazines that sit shrinkwrapped behind the cash registers of convenience stores, and they are a worldly and jaded crew indeed, but Schimmel gets a couple of them—whose noms de guerre are Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth—laughing so uproariously that people at the Anabolic Video table nearby keep looking over in annoyance. At one point during a routine on premature ejaculation, Dick Filth actually chokes on a California roll.

… But all this is Saturday night, the main event. And there are a whole lot of festivities preceding Saturday’s climax.

The adult industry is vulgar. Would anyone disagree? One of the AVN Awards’ categories is “Best Anal Themed Feature”; another is “Best Overall Marketing Campaign—Company Image.” Irresistible, a 1983 winner in several categories, has been spelled Irresistable in Adult Video News for fifteen straight years. The industry’s not only vulgar, it’s predictably vulgar. All the clichés are true. The typical porn producer really is the ugly little man with a bad toupee and a pinkie-ring the size of a Rolaids. The typical porn director really is the guy who uses the word class as a noun to mean refinement. The typical porn starlet really is the lady in Lycra eveningwear with tattoos all down her arms who’s both smoking and chewing gum while telling journalists how grateful she is to Wadcutter Productions Ltd. for footing her breast-enlargement bill. And meaning it. The whole AVN Awards weekend comprises what Mr. Dick Filth calls an Irony-Free Zone.

But of course we should keep in mind that vulgar has many dictionary definitions and that only a couple of these have to do w/ lewdness or bad taste. At root, vulgar just means popular on a mass scale. It is the semantic opposite of pretentious or snobby. It is humility with a comb-over. It is Nielsen ratings and Barnum’s axiom and the real bottom line. It is big, big business.

Thirty-four-year-old porn actor Cal Jammer killed himself in 1995. Starlets Shauna Grant, Nancy Kelly, Alex Jordan, and Savannah have all killed themselves in the last decade. Savannah and Jordan received AVN’s Best New Starlet awards in 1991 and 1992, respectively. Savannah killed herself after getting mildly disfigured in a car accident. Alex Jordan is famous for having addressed her suicide note to her pet bird. Crewman and performer Israel Gonzalez killed himself at a porn company warehouse in 1997.

An LA-based support group called PAW (=Protecting Adult Welfare) runs a 24-hour crisis line for people in the adult industry. A fundraiser for PAW was held at a Mission Hills CA bowling alley last November. It was a nude bowling tournament. Dozens of starlets agreed to take part. Two or three hundred adult-video fans showed up and paid to watch them bowl naked. No production companies or their executives participated or gave money. The fundraiser took in $6,000, which is slightly less than two one-millionths of porn’s yearly gross.

As you know if you’ve seen Casino, Showgirls, Bugsy, etc., there are really three Las Vegases. Binion’s, where the World Series of Poker is always played, exemplifies the “Old Vegas,” centered around Fremont Street. Las Vegas’s future is even now under late-stage construction at the very end of the Strip, on the outskirts of town (where US malls always go up); it’s to be a bunch of theme-parkish, more “family-oriented” venues of the kind that De Niro describes so plangently at the end of Casino.

But Las Vegas as most of us see it, Vegas qua Vegas, comprises the dozen or so hotels that flank the Strip’s middle. Vegas Populi: the opulent, intricate, garish, ecstatically decadent hotels, cathedra to gambling, partying, and live entertainment of the most microphone- swinging sort. The Sands. The Sahara. The Stardust. MGM Grand, Maxim. All within a small radius. Yearly utility expenditures on neon well into seven figures. Harrah’s, Casino Royale (with its big 24-hour Denny’s attached), Flamingo Hilton, Imperial Palace. The Mirage, with its huge laddered waterfall always lit up. Circus Circus. Treasure Island, with its intricate facade of decks and rigging and mizzens and vang. The Luxor, shaped like a ziggurat from Babylon of yore. Barbary Coast, whose sign out front says CASH YOUR PAYCHECK—WIN UP TO $25,000. These hotels are the Vegas we know. The land of Lola and Wayne. Of Siegfried and Roy, Copperfield. Showgirls in towering headdress. Sinatra’s sandbox. Most of them built in the ’50s and ’60s, the era of mob chic and entertainment-cum-industry. Half-hour lines for taxis. Smoking not just allowed but encouraged. Toupees and convention nametags and women in furs of all hue. A museum that features the World’s Biggest Coke Bottle. The Harley-Davidson Cafe, with its tympanum of huge protruding hawg; Bally’s H&C, with its row of phallic pillars all electrified and blinking in grand mal sync. A city that pretends to be nothing but what it is, an enormous machine of exchange—of spectacle for money, of sensation for money, of money for more money, of pleasure for whatever be tomorrow’s abstract cost.

Nor let us forget Vegas’s synecdoche and beating heart. It’s kittycorner from Bally’s: Caesars Palace. The granddaddy. As big as 20 Wal-Marts end to end. Real marble and fake marble, carpeting you can pass out on without contusion, 130,000 square feet of casino alone. Domed ceilings, clerestories, barrel vaults. In Caesars Palace is America conceived as a new kind of Rome: conqueror of its own people. An empire of Self. It’s breathtaking. The winter’s light rain makes all the neon bleed. The whole thing is almost too pretty to stand. There could be no site but Las Vegas’s Caesars for modern porn’s Awards show—here, the AAVNAs are one more spectacle. Way more tourists and conventioneers recognize the starlets than you’d expect. Double-takes all over the hotel. Even just standing around or putting coins in a slot machine, the performers become a prime attraction. Las Vegas doesn’t miss a trick.

The Annual AVN Awards are always scheduled to coincide with the International Consumer Electronics Show (a.k.a. CES), which this year runs from 8 through 11 January. The CES is a very big deal. It’s like a combination convention and talent show for the best and brightest in the world of consumer tech. Steve Forbes is here, and DSS’s Thomson. Sun Microsystems is using this year’s CES to launch its PersonalJava 1.0. Bill Gates gives a packed-house speech on Saturday morning. Major players from TV, cable, and merchandising host a panel on the short-term viability of HDTV. A forum on the problem of product returns by disgruntled customers seats 1,500 and is SRO. The CES as a whole is bigger than your correspondents’ hometowns. It’s spread out over four different hotels and has 10,000+ booths with everything from “The First Ever Full Text Message Pager in a Wristwatch” to the world’s premier self-heating home satellite dish (“The Snow and Ice Solution!”).

But far and away the CES’s most popular venue, with total attendance well over 100,000 every year, is what is called the Adult Software5 exhibition, despite the fact that the CES itself treats the Adult tradeshow kind of like the crazy relative in the family and keeps it way out in what used to be the parking garage of the Sands hotel. This facility, a serious bus ride from all the other CES sites, is an enormous windowless all-cement space that during show hours manages to induce both agoraphobia and claustrophobia. A big sign says you have to be 21 to get in. The median age inside is 45, almost all males, nearly everyone wearing some sort of conventioneer’s nametag. Every production company in the adult industry, from Anabolic to Zane, has a booth here. The really big companies have booths that are sprawling and multidisplay and more like small strip malls. A lot of porn’s top female performers are contract players, exclusive vendors to one particular production company; and one reason why a lot of the starlets seem kind of tired and cranky by Saturday night’s Awards gala is that they will have spent much of the previous 72 hours at their companies’ CES booths, on their feet all day in vertiginous heels, signing autographs and posing for pictures and pressing all manner of flesh.

The best way to describe the sonic environment at the ’98 CES is: Imagine that the apocalypse took the form of a cocktail party. Male fans move through the fractal maze of booths in groups of three or more. Their expressions tend to be those of junior-high boys at a peephole, an expression that looks pretty surreal on a face with jowls and no hairline. Some among them are video retailers; most are not. Most are just hard-core fans, the industry’s breath and bread. A lot of them not only recognize but seem to know the names, stage names, and curricula vitae of almost all the female performers.

It takes an average of two hours and twelve minutes to traverse the Adult CES expo, counting an average of four delays for getting lost after a chicane turn or some baroque ceiling-high cheval glass designed to double the visual exposure of Heatwave Video’s display for Texas Dildo Masquerade gets you all turned around. Your correspondents are accompanied by Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth, who have very generously offered to act as guides and docents, and here is a random spatter of the things we see the first time we come in:

A second-tier Arrow Video starlet in a G-string poses for a photo, forked dorsally over the knee of a morbidly obese cellphone retailer from suburban Philadelphia. The guy taking the picture, whose CES nametag says Hi and that his name is Sherm, addresses the starlet as “babe” and asks her to readjust so as to “give us a little more bush down there.” An Elegant Angel starlet with polyresin wings attached to her back is eating a Milky Way bar while she signs video boxes. Actor Steven St. Croix is standing near the Caballero Home Video booth, saying to no one in particular “Let me out of here, I can’t wait to get out of here.”6 Adult-video stores all have a distinctive smell—a mix of cheap magnetic tape and disinfectant—and the Sands’ former parking garage is rank with it. Asian businessmen move through the aisles in dense graceful packs and are assiduously cheery and polite. A young guy in a full-color Frankenstein T-shirt is spraypainting cartoon flames on an actress’s breasts at the Sin City booth. The actress—an obscure one, not even Filth and Hecuba know her name—has normal-size breasts, and there’s not much of an audience. Producer/director Max Hardcore draws a way bigger crowd at the MAXWORLD booth, where one of his girls is squatting on the countertop masturbating with the butt of a riding crop. Max’s videos’ promotional posters have him carrying a girl in minishorts over his shoulder against the backdrop of various city skylines; the pitches at the bottom say “SEE PRETTY GIRLS SODOMIZED IN MANNERS MOST FOUL! SEE CUM-SPLATTERED GIRLS TOO STUPID TO KNOW BETTER!” Max is a story all to himself, according to Harold Hecuba. D. Filth and a porn executive dressed entirely in Campbell Nightwatch plaid are smoking cigars and keep holding their cigars up together and comparing the ash to see which one has the cleanest burn. A lot of the industry males and even some of the starlets are also smoking cigars. 1998 is definitely the Year of the Cigar. The starlets are all in either extremely formal cocktail dresses or else abbreviated latex/vinyl/ Lycra ensembles. Heels are uniformly sharp and ultrahigh. Some of the starlets are so heavily made up they look embalmed. They tend to have complexly coiffed hair that looks really good from 20 feet away but on closer inspection is dry and dead. Someone who is either sometime-performer Jeff Marton or “Bizarro-Sleaze” filmmaker Gregory Dark is doing sleight-of-hand tricks with his trademark fedora.7 Whoever he is, he has a goatee. Harold Hecuba also has a goatee; Dick Filth has more like a soul patch. H.H. and D.F., longtime industry journalists, know everybody here and keep getting stopped and drawn into conversations. (These delays, during which yr. corresps. sort of stand there awkwardly at the edge of the conversation and try to look around as if they too know people here and are waiting only to spot them in the crowd before they go off and get into their own involved conversations, have not been included in the 132-minute Adult CES-traversal average.) This year, a good 75 percent of the males in and around the porn industry appear to be sporting variants of the goatee.8

Next to the Outlaw Video booth, a starlet in a gold lamé spaghetti-strap gown, chewing gum and blowing large blue bubbles, is being videotaped by a disabled fan whose camera and parabolic mike are bolted to the arm of his wheelchair; the starlet is pointing to the tattoos on her left arm and appears to be explaining the origin and context of each one. At the Vivid Video multibooth complex,9 Ms. Taylor Hayes has what is probably the longest autograph-and-flesh-press line in the entire Sands garage. Taylor is major-league pretty—she looks like a slightly debauched Cindy Crawford—and an oversize monitor suspended from the ceiling over the Vivid area plays clips of her scantily clad and dancing amid dry-ice fumes. There’s a berm of boxed videos on the floor by the counter and a huge man with a visor and handheld credit card machine on Taylor’s right flank as she greets each fan like a long-lost relative. According to Dick Filth, Taylor is both a genuinely nice person and a consummate pro.

The booth for XPlor Media—a company known for its “Southern Belles” video series and ORGY FOR WORLD PEACE Website—is arresting because all the execs at XPlor seem to be under 25 and the booth’s atmosphere is that of a fraternity party in its third straight day. One young bald guy is unconscious in a fetal position on the counter, and some wag has glued all sorts of feathers and flaccid plastic two-headed dildoish things to his skull. XPlor’s owner-auteurs are two brothers, trust-fund babies from a Connecticut suburb of NYC. Their names are Farrel and Moffitt Timlake. Farrel, who wears twelve-hole Doc Martens and cargo pants and what’s either a very light parka or very heavy sweatshirt with a hood that stays up at all times, is a particular cause célèbre at the ’98 CES because he’s apparently a friend of the two guys who do South Park, and these guys are rumored to be in Vegas and to possess tickets to Saturday’s Awards banquet.10

Everyone without exception is sweating. At all but a few of the booths, contract starlets treat the fans with the same absent, rigid-faced courtesy that flight attendants and restaurant hostesses tend to use. You can tell how bored the performers are by the way their faces light up when they see someone they know. Well over half of the industry’s current superstars are in this huge room.11 The infamous T.T. Boy is here, standing alone with his trademark glower, the Boy who is rumored to bring a semiautomatic pistol with him to the set and who was featured in a 1995 New Yorker article that was full of lines like “A porn shoot is an intricately delineated ecology.” Mr. Vince Vouyer (sic) is on hand, as are Seth Gecko, Jake Steed, Serenity, Missy, and Nick East. Here is the ageless Randy West, who looks just the way a surfer would look if that surfer were also a Mob enforcer, with his perennial tan and hair like frozen surf. Mr. Jon Dough—winner of AVN’s coveted Best Actor/Video statuette in both ’96 and ’97—alternates between various booths, wearing his customary expression of having psychologically evolved to the point where he’s so incredibly cool and detached that life is one long yawn. Here also is Mark Davis, far and away the most handsome of the current males, a near-double for Gregory Harrison of the old Trapper John series except for Davis’s ultrashort psych-patient haircut (plus goatee).

And 20-year veteran Joey Silvera is at this year’s CES, though mostly in his capacity as an auteur: Silvera now directs Evil Angel’s popular “Butt Row” video series.12 Following the lead of pioneers like John Leslie and Paul Thomas, most of today’s top male stars now also direct (and, per the store boxes, “Present”) their own line of videos, e.g. “Tom Byron’s Cumback Pussy” series, “Jon Dough’s Dirty Stories,” the eye-popping Rocco Siffredi’s “[Various European Cities] By Night” line, etc. The So-and-So Presents series seems to be an industry trend, like cigars and goatees.

It is difficult to describe how it feels to gaze at living human beings whom you’ve seen perform in hard-core porn. To shake the hand of a man whose precise erectile size, angle, and vasculature are known to you. That strange I-think-we’ve-met-before sensation one feels upon seeing any celebrity in the flesh is here both intensified and twisted. It feels intensely twisted to see reigning industry queen Jenna Jameson chilling out at the Vivid booth in Jordaches and a latex bustier and to know already that she has a tattoo of a sundered valentine with the tagline HEART BREAKER on her right buttock and a tiny hairless mole just left of her anus. To watch Peter North try to get a cigar lit and to have that sight backlit by memories of his artilleryesque ejaculations.13 To have seen these strangers’ faces in orgasm—that most unguarded and purely neural of expressions, the one so vulnerable that for centuries you basically had to marry a person to get to see it.14 This weirdness may account for some of the complex emotional intercourse taking place between the performers and fans at the Adult CES. The patrons may leer and elbow one another at a distance, but by the time the men get to the front of the line and face the living incarnation of their VCR’s fantasy-babe, most of them turn into quivering goggle-eyed schoolboys, sheepish and salivaless and damp. The same thing evidently happens at the hundreds of strip clubs all over the country where porn starlets appear as Featured Dancers (for five figures a week, according to Filth) and do photos and autographs after the show:

“Most of these guys become incredibly nervous when I come up to them,” veteran starlet Shane has explained. “I’ll put my arms around a guy and his whole body will be trembling. They pretty much do whatever I tell them to do.” The whole industry, now, has this oddly reversed equation—the consumers are the ones who seem ashamed or shy, while the performers are cocky and smooth and 100 percent pro.
It is no longer the 1980s, and the Meese Commission mentality that led to a major crackdown on video porn is long gone. Federal task forces and PTA outrage are now focused on the Internet and kiddie porn. But today’s adult industry is still hypersensitive about what it perceives as fascist attacks on its First Amendment freedoms. A specially prepared trailer now runs before many higher-end adult videos, right between the legal disclaimer on the product’s compliance with or exemption from 18 U.S.C §2257 and ads for phone services like 900-666-FUCK. Against shots of flowing flags and the Lincoln Memorial, a voiceover says stuff like:

Censorship goes against our Bill of Rights and the founding principles of this country. It is an attempt on the part of the government to legislate morality and to stifle free expression.15 This new, “legal” morality is dangerous to all Americans. Vote for those who believe in limiting government intrusion into your personal affairs. Vote against government control of your life and home. Vote against censorship. Only you, the People, can keep the American ideal intact.

These trailers always say they’re sponsored by either the Adult Video Association or something called the Free Speech Coalition. Both organizations (and the extent to which the two are separate is unclear) are basically industry PACs. Porn, in other words, has taken the political lessons of the ’80s to heart; it is now a hard-lobbying political force no less than GM or RJR Nabisco.

Feminists of all different stripe oppose the adult industry for reasons having to do with pornography’s putative effects on women. Their arguments are well-known and in some respects persuasive. But certain antiporn arguments in the 1990s are now centered on adult entertainment’s alleged effects on the men who consume it. Some “masculists” believe that a lot of men get addicted to video porn in a way that causes grievous psychic harm. Example: An essayist named David Mura has a little book called A Male Grief: Notes on Pornography and Addiction, which is a bit New Agey but interesting in places, e.g.:

At the essence of pornography is the image of flesh used as a drug, a way of numbing psychic pain. But this drug lasts only as long as the man stares at the image… . In pornographic perception, each gesture, each word, each image, is read first and foremost through sexuality. Love or tenderness, pity or compassion, become subsumed by, and are made subservient to, a “greater” deity, a more powerful force… . The addict to pornography desires to be blinded, to live in a dream. Those in the thrall of pornography try to eliminate from their consciousness the world outside pornography, and this includes everything from their family and friends or last Sunday’s sermon to the political situation in the Middle East. In engaging in such elimination the viewer reduces himself. He becomes stupid.

This kind of stuff might sound a little out-there, maybe, until one observes the eerie similarity between the eyes of males in strip clubs or stroke parlors and the eyes of people in their fifth hour of pumping silver dollars into the slot machines of the Sands’ casino, or maybe until one’s seen firsthand the odd kind of shock on the faces of CES patrons seeing performers now “in the flesh,” complete with chewing gum and chin-pimples and all the human stuff you never see—never want to see—in films.

Maybe just a little bit more here on the whole scene at the Adult CES, which is a lot more of a rub-elbows-type venue than the stylized Awards ceremony is going to end up being… . Mr. Harold Hecuba is deep in conversation with a marginal porn producer about one of his performers’ being sidelined with something called a “prolapsed sphincter,” which condition yr. corresps. decline to follow up on in any way. We are standing just west of a staff writer for Digital Horizons who’s dropped by to scope out the legendary scene in here again this year and is telling two presumed other tech writers that being around porn people always makes him feel like he’s been somehow astrally projected onto a cocktail napkin. It is also roughly now that Ms. Jasmin St. Claire is making an appearance at the Impressive Media booth in order to spell the starlet behind the counter, who is limping to the booth’s rear area; she (i.e., the limping starlet) has (reportedly) had to be sprayed with silicon to fit into her pants. The crowd at the Impressive Media venue immediately starts to enlarge. Jasmin St. Claire is wearing a red vinyl jacket-and-miniskirt ensemble. A porn starlet entering any kind of room or area has a distinctive energy about her—you turn your head to look even if you don’t seem to want to. It’s like watching a figure from a pinball machine illustration or high-concept comic book step out into 3-D and head your way. It turns out really to be possible to feel as though your eyeballs are protruding slightly from their sockets. What makes the whole thing so weird is that Jasmin St. Claire isn’t even all that pretty, at least not today. Her hair is dyed black in that cheap unreal Goth way, and she is so incredibly heavily made up that she looks like a crow. (She is also somewhat knock-kneed, plus of course has the requisite Howitzer-grade bust.) Ms. St. Claire is being escorted to the Impressive booth by two large men whose expressions are describable only as mug-shottish. This is another thing about porn starlets—they’re never alone. They’re always accompanied by at least one and sometimes as many as four flinty-eyed males. The impression is that of a very expensive thoroughbred being led onto the track under a silk blanket.

FYI, Ms. Jasmin St. Claire’s cult-celebrity status at the ’98 CES stems from her having broken the “World Gang Bang Record”16 by taking on 300 men in a row in Amazing Pictures’ 1996 World’s Biggest Gang Bang 2. Since most of these 300 men were amateur porn-fans who’d had only to fill out an application and produce an HIV all-clear from the DPH, she now enjoys an almost legendary populist appeal—“the People’s Porn Star”—and an enormous serpentine line of fans with cameras and autographable memorabilia has formed at the Impressive booth, which line Ms. St. Claire appears for the moment to be ignoring, because she and H. Hecuba, having exchanged double-cheek kisses, are now deep into some kind of tête-à-tête above the sockless Docksiders of the unconscious bald kid, who’s (the kid has) evidently been carried or trundled by pranksters unknown from the XPlor counter (right next door) to this one. Dick Filth—after your correspondents have remarked on how it’s kind of heartwarming that everyone in the porn industry all seem to be friends, even critics and performers—dishes an involved anecdote about how Jasmin St. Claire apparently once actually tried to strangle Harold Hecuba at an industry soirée a couple years ago, an anecdote which, if you’re interested, appears as FN17 just below. Twenty feet away, over at XPlor, Mr. Farrel Timlake has meanwhile produced what is alleged to be the prototype and world’s only authorized Kenny® Action Figure from the upcoming South Park merchandising line—fourteen inches tall, kind of heavy for a doll, w/ hood up and face obscured (not unlike F. Timlake’s own hood and face)—and is entertaining some of the IM crowd’s spillover by manipulating the doll’s limbs to simulate its “tok[ing] a bone.”

Not unlike urban gangs, police, carnival workers, and certain other culturally marginalized guilds, the US porn industry is occluded and insular in a way that makes it seem like high school. There are cliques, anticliques, alliances, betrayals, conflagratory rumors, legendary enmities, and public bloodlettings, plus involved hierarchies of popularity and influence. You’re either In or you’re not. Performers, being the industry’s fissile core, are of course In. Despite their financial power, studio execs and producers are not very In, and directors (especially those who’ve never undergone the initiation of having on-camera sex themselves) are less In than the performers. Film reviewers and industry journalists are even less In than execs; and nonindustry journalists are way, way non-In, almost as low-caste as the great mass of porn fans themselves (for which fans the Insider term is: mook18 ).

The foregoing is meant to help explain how exactly your correspondents ended up in porn titan Max Hardcore’s personal suite at the Sahara and got to hang out in the suite’s living room with Max, certain of his crew, porn starlets Alex Dane and Caressa Savage, and two B-girls—which is to say that it was actually Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth who were invited to hang out in the suite on Friday afternoon, but yr. corresps. clung almost like papooses to their backs, and the burly MAXWORLD Production Assistant wasn’t quick enough about slamming the door.
So yr. corresps. were, for a couple hours, at least logistically speaking, In.

For a regular civilian male, hanging out in a hotel suite with porn starlets is a tense and emotionally convolved affair. There is, first, the matter of having seen the various intimate activities and anatomical parts of these starlets in videos heretofore and thus (weirdly) feeling shy about meeting them. But there is also a complex erotic tension. Because porn films’ worlds are so sexualized, with everybody seemingly teetering right on the edge of coitus all the time and it taking only the slightest nudge or excuse—a stalled elevator, an unlocked door, a cocked eyebrow, a firm handshake—to send everyone tumbling into a tangled mass of limbs and orifices, there’s a bizarre unconscious expectation/dread/ hope that this is what might happen in Max Hardcore’s hotel room. Yr. corresps. here find it impossible to overemphasize the fact that this is a delusion. In fact, of course, the unconscious expectation/dread/hope makes no more sense than it would make to be hanging out with doctors at a medical convention and to expect that at the slightest provocation everyone in the room would tumble into a frenzy of MRIs and epidurals. Nevertheless the tension persists, despite the fact that the actresses are obviously tired and disassociated from the day’s CES,19 plus, it emerges, somewhat sore—it turns out that Max Hardcore is shooting one of his “Gonzo” porn spectaculars right here at the 1998 Consumer Electronics Show, using the CES as a hook and backdrop, and the girls have been alternating CES booth-duty and riding-crop shenanigans with a tight and SS-intensive filming schedule. (Max, being a firm believer in the fait accompli method of filmmaking, has not yet gotten around to chatting with the CES’s administration about his featuring the world’s biggest consumer-tech tradeshow by name in a “SEE PRETTY GIRLS SODOMIZED IN MANNERS MOST FOUL” video.)

Mr. Max Hardcore—a.k.a. Max Steiner, a.k.a. Paul Steiner, né Paul Little—is 5'6"" and a very fit 135. He is somewhere between 40 and 60 years old and resembles more than anything a mesomorphic and borderline-psycho Henry Gibson. He is wearing a black cowboy hat and what has to be one of the very few long-sleeved Hawaiian shirts in existence anywhere. Once the PA guarding the door mellows out and introductions are made (H.H. managing to drop the name of this magazine several times in one sentence), Max reveals himself to be a genial and garrulous host and offers everybody disposable plastic cups of vodka before settling in with yr. corresps. to discuss what for Max are the most pressing and relevant issues at this year’s AVN Awards, which issues are the career, reputation, personal history, and overall life philosophy of Mr. Max Hardcore.

Pioneered (depending whom you talk to) by either Max Hardcore or John (“Buttman”) Stagliano, “Gonzo” has become one of this decade’s most popular and profitable genres of adult video. It’s more or less a cross between an MTV documentary and the Hell panel from Bosch’s Garden of Earthly Delights. A Gonzo film is always set at some distinctive locale or occasion—Daytona Beach at spring break, the Cannes Film Festival, etc. There’s always a randy and salivous “host” talking directly to a handheld camera: “Well and we’re here at the Cannes Film Festival, and it looks like there’s going to be lots of excitement, John Travolta and Sigourney Weaver are supposed to both be in town, and there’s also the world-famous beach, and I’m told there’s always some real seriously good-looking little girls at the beach, so let’s us head on down.” (That’s the approximate lead-in to a recent Max-at-Cannes Gonzo, a type of signature lead-in that Max refers to with a 56-tooth grin as “always mercifully brief”—and please note the “little girls at the beach” thing, because this is another of Max’s professional signatures, the infantilization of his videos’ females as dramatic foils for his own film persona, which is always that of a sort of degenerate uncle or stepdad.) Then the shaky but ever-focused camera heads on down to the ocean or mall or CES or whatever, scoping out attractive women20 while the host moans and chews his knuckle in lust. Then pretty soon host and camera start actually coming up to the women they’ve been looking at and engaging them in little cameo “interviews” full of sideways leers and salacious entendres. Some of the interviewees are actual civilians, but some are always what Max refers to as “ringers,” meaning professional porn actresses. And so the viewer is treated to the classic frathouse fantasy of moving, via just a couple of singles-bar “Hey there babe” lines, from scoping out an attractive woman to having wild and anatomically diverse sex with her, all while one of his buddies captures the whole thing on tape.21

The issue of who exactly invented Gonzo being impossibly vexed and so notwithstanding, it is true that Max Hardcore is famous as a director for several things: (1) Being incredibly disciplined about budgets and tactical logistics, right down to forcing his crew and staff to wear identical jumpsuits of scarlet nylon so that they look like a national ski team—Max’s shoots are described (by Max) as “almost military operations”; (2) Not only employing ringers but actually sometimes being able to talk real live civilian “little girls” on the beach or in the mall into coming on back to the special MAXWORLD RV and having anal sex on camera;22 (3) Being the first in “mainstream” (meaning nonfetish) adult video to perpetrate on women levels of violation and degradation that would have been unthinkable even a few years ago. W/r/t item (3), Max, after detailing for yr. correspondents the vo- and avocations that led him into the adult industry (a tale too literally incredible even to think about factchecking and trying to print), informs us that he is and always has been adult video’s “cutting-edge blade,” and that other less bold and original filmmakers have systematically stolen and used his, Max’s, degradations of women as a blueprint for their own subsequent shabby and derivative films’ degradations.23 (Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth, by the way, have heard Max hold forth many times before and are now outside the circle of discourse—D.F. in the bathroom for what seems like a peculiarly long time, H.H. on the couch with the actresses hashing out the implications of Seinfeld’s retirement for NBC’s ’98 lineup.)

Alone and in a place of conspicuous honor on a wood-finish shelf above the suite’s minibar is an actual AVN Awards statuette. The trophy resembles an Oscar/Emmy/Clio except that the figurine’s arms are up and out (making it also look a bit like Richard Nixon at the climax of the ’68 GOP convention), and something slightly blurry about the casting gives it a sort of cubic-zirconium aspect. Whether the statuette is heavy and solid vs. hollow and Little Leaguish remains unknown—there is no invitation to touch or heft it. One of the B-girls on the couch is now either laughing or weeping into her hands at something Harold Hecuba has said; her bare shoulders heave. It would be totally fantastic if the Seinfeld rerun on the huge TV were the episode about everybody trying to refrain from masturbating, but it isn’t.

Asked by one of yr. corresps. what he won this AVN Award on the shelf for, Max Hardcore slaps his knee: “I fucking stole it.” It’s now that hard middle-distance inspection reveals that the MAX HARDCORE on the metal strip at the trophy’s base has been scratched in by someone who is not a professional engraver. It looks done with a screwdriver, in fact. Max expands on the statuette caper: Shut inexplicably out of the Awards for years, he last year, upon exiting the stage (he’s always a presenter every year, which he regards as the AVNAs’ way of twisting the emotional blade), espied in the wings a large cardboard box filled with blank and unused AVN Award statuettes.24 Whereupon he thought, as he now puts it, “What the fuck, I fucking deserve it” and snagged one, hiding it in his enormous Stetson and deriving no little satisfaction from attending various post-Awards parties with an illicit statuette under his hat. Max’s crew all laugh very hard at this anecdote, though the actresses don’t.

Alex Dane is now telling Harold Hecuba about a stray dog she found and has decided to keep. She is excited as she describes the dog and for a moment seems about fourteen; the impression lasts only a second or two and is heartbreaking. One of the B-girls, meanwhile, is explaining that she has just gotten a pair of cutting-edge breast implants that she can actually adjust the size of by adding or draining fluid via small valves under her armpits, and then—perhaps mistaking your correspondents’ expressions for ones of disbelief—she raises her arms to display the valves. There really are what appear to be valves.

So much about today’s adult industry seems like an undeft parody of Hollywood and the nation writ large. The top performers are comic-book caricatures of sexual allure. The prosthetic breasts and lifted buttocks and (no kidding) artificial cheekbones are nothing more than accentuations of a mentality that yields huge liposuction and collagen industries. The gynecologically explicit sexuality of Jenna, Jasmin, et al. seems more than anything like a Mad magazine spoof of the “smoldering” sexuality of Sharon Stone and Madonna and so many other mainstream iconettes.25 Not to mention the fact that the adult industry takes many of the psychological deformities that Hollywood is famous for—the vanity, the vulgarity, the rank commercialism—and not only makes them overt and grotesque but seems then to revel in that grotesquerie.

Good old Max Hardcore, for instance, is a total psychopath—that’s part of his on-screen Gonzo persona—but so is the real Max/Paul Steiner. You’d almost have to have been there in that suite. Max sits holding court in his hat and pointy boots, looking at once magisterial and mindless, while his red-suited acolytes laugh on cue and a jr. high dropout shows off her valves. In truth, the first ten minutes of the impromptu interview in the Sahara are spent passing around a copy of something called Icon magazine, which Max has told us is doing a profile on him—we are expected to leaf through the magazine and comment favorably on its content and layout while Max watches us in the same hyperexpectant way that parents watch you when you’re looking at a snapshot of their kid that they’ve taken out uninvited and pressed on you. This is the actual chronology. There then follows a torrent of autobiography and background that yr. corresps. have decided to deny Max the satisfaction of seeing reproduced here. After which is a kind of Max 101-like survey of personal philosophy and Gonzo theory and the statuette anecdote. The vodka is top-shelf and the plastic cups dusty. Then one of the starlets decides that she’s hungry, and Max insists on escorting her down to the Sahara’s restaurant and wants everybody else to come along, which eventually results in the B-girls and crewmen and yr. corresps.26 all standing there awkwardly at the maître d’s podium while Max personally conducts the starlet to her table and pulls out her chair and tucks a serviette into her cleavage and pulls out a platinum-plated money clip and announces in a voice audible to everyone in the restaurant and foyer that he “want[s] to take care of the little girl’s damages in advance” and shoves bills into the hanky-pocket of the maître d’s tuxedo and then leaves her there by herself and herds us all back out and into the elevator and jabs impatiently at the button for his suite’s floor, almost jumping up and down with fury at the elevator’s delay; and we’re all rushed back up to the suite because it’s occurred to Max that he wants to show your corresps. something from this week’s filming that he thinks will sum up his particular porn genius better than any amount of exposition could … and then, reseated, he starts flipping through a notebook to find something.

“What it is is we got this one little girl back in the [infamous MAXWORLD] trailer, and after some face-fucking27 and reaming her asshole and, like, your standard depravities, we get her to stick a pen—no, a what-do-you-call …”

Crewman: “Magic Marker.”

Max: “… Magic Marker, stick it up her asshole and write all this … this stuff,” holding up the notebook, opened to a page; again he has us pass it around:

is thereon written in a hand28 that seems impressively legible, considering. Dick Filth makes a waggish inquiry about future film plans involving this girl and a typewriter, but Max doesn’t laugh (we noticed that Max never laughs at a joke he hasn’t told), and so neither does anyone else.

Doubtless most of this is going to get cut by Premiere, but it’s worth also observing—when this magazine’s assigned photographer (who’s also gotten in here with us this afternoon on H.H. and D.F.’s coattails) begins wondering aloud about the possibility of getting some good portraits at the Awards of winners holding their statuettes—the way Max right away jumps in with his idea of the perfect photo for the title page of this very article. The proposed shot is to be of Max Hardcore, holding several of the AVN Awards trophies he pledges either to win straight up or to gain possession of in other ways, seated in some kind of imperial-looking and really nice chair that is itself set up on the palm-studded boulevard of the famous Las Vegas Strip—so the photographer’ll get lots of smeary neon and appropriately phallic bldgs. in the background—with a retinue of scantily clad starlets either draped swoonily over him or prostrate at his feet, or both. It is important to note that there are no audible scare-quotes, no irony or embarrassment or self-awareness of any sort on Max’s face as he sketches this photo’s tableau for us; he’s in the kind of earnest that one imagines Irving Thalberg was always in.29 Your correspondents immediately begin to lobby hard for Max’s idea, figuring that the photo would make a great illustration for the story of Max’s proposing this very photo—i.e., that it would point up the megalomania far more powerfully than mere reportage—but the Premiere photographer, who is no actor, does such a poor job of disguising his repulsion at Max’s self-regard that the atmosphere of the whole suite gets stilted and complexly hostile, and the rest of the interview is kind of a fizzle-yield, and overall Dick Filth said that we failed, in his phrase, to “penetrate to the core of the essence of what it is to be Max Hardcore.”30

The 15th Annual AVN Awards are actually split over two consecutive nights, a tactic that Max H. thought the legit Oscars would do well to emulate: “Get all the bullshit out of the way the first night—best packaging, marketing, best gay, shit like that. Who wants to sit through that shit?”

Held in a different, slightly smaller Caesars Palace ballroom, Friday’s Awards show is indeed brisk. The ephemeral categories include Best Videography, Best Screenplay, Best Art Direction, Best Music. Each category’s nominees are listed in the program, but only the winners are announced onstage, and they’re announced four at a time, and applause is discouraged, and the master of ceremonies keeps telling the quartets of winners that “If you’ll come on up quickly and help keep things moving it’ll help us out a lot.” Friday’s only food is big wheels of vegetables and dip near the cash bar. The emcee is not headliner Robert Schimmel but a hypomanic guy named Dave Tyree, whose interpolated banter is 78 rpm and consists of stuff like “If God didn’t want us to jerk off he would’ve made our arms shorter.” There are maybe 1,000 people in attendance, most only slightly dressed up, and there are no assigned tables, and everybody in the ballroom is moving around and chattering and treating the onstage proceedings the way people in a cocktail lounge treat the piano player.

Q. $4,000,000,000 and 8,000 new releases a year—why is adult video so popular in this country?
A. Director and AVN-Hall-of-Fame inductee F. J. Lincoln: “It’s always a little funny how it’s called adult. What it really is, you get to be a kid again. You roll around and get dirty. It’s the adult sandbox.”
A. Veteran woodman Joey Silvera: “Dudes, let’s face it—America wants to jerk off.”
A. Industry journalist Harold Hecuba: “It’s the new Barnum. Nobody ever goes broke overestimating the rage and misogyny of the average American male.”
A. Porn starlet Jacklyn Lick: “I think a lot of fans are very lonely people.”
Q. There don’t seem to be a whole lot of condoms used in hard-core scenes.
A. Harold Hecuba: “Never have been. They’re viewed as a turn-off. This business is about engineering fantasies.”
Q. But even just venerially—all these anal shenanigans and everything. Is there much worry in the industry about HIV?
A. Harold Hecuba: “There’s not as much worry about AIDS now. Everybody gets tested on a schedule.”
Q. What about herpes?
A. H.H.: “I think it’s rampant.”

Last year’s Best-Sex-Scene-in-a-Film winner Vince Vouyer’s real name turns out to be John LaForme. Rhetorical Q.: How, if one’s real name was John LaForme, could that person possibly feel the need for a nom de guerre?

Mr. Tom Byron describes being able to tumesce and ejaculate more or less on demand as an exercise in “control, like meditation or surfing. It’s like a gymnast staying on the balance beam. You practice enough, you can do anything.”31

Former woodman and current auteur Paul Thomas was a member of the original Broadway cast of Jesus Christ Superstar.

The tall, crazed-looking, and ever-rampant Mike Horner, three-time Best Actor winner and a member of the AVN Hall of Fame,32 is actually a classically trained opera singer.

Deceased starlet Nancy Kelly’s real name was Kelly Van Dyke. She was the daughter of TV’s Jerry Van Dyke and so, of course, the niece of Dick.

Exotic rookie actress Midori, one of the nominees in the ’98 AVNAs’ Best New Starlet category, is the sister of ’80s pop star Jodi Whatley. Midori has stated publicly that she views upscale contemporary porn as a stepping-stone to a mainstream career, not unlike becoming Miss America or doing a couple seasons on SNL. Harold Hecuba characterizes Midori’s career strategy as “grievously ill-advised.”

Adult Video News VP and Executive Editor Gene Ross, presenting the aforementioned 1998 AVN Award for Best Director/Video to Miscreants’ Rob Black, will hail Mr. Black as “a guy who can take buttholes, midgets, and fried fish, and make a love story.”33

From The New Yorker’s 1995 article on the psychosexual plight of the adult industry’s woodman: “The Cal Jammers who are part of this feminization feel they have stormed the walls of female ornament to reclaim male prerogative, only to find themselves lost in a garden of gender irony.”

Mr. John “Buttman” Stagliano—CEO of Evil Angel Inc., a man described by US News & World Report as “the nation’s leading director of hard-core videos”—not only has publicly announced testing positive for HIV but has identified the infection’s vector as a transsexual prostitute in São Paulo with whom Stagliano had unprotected anal intercourse in 1995. He’s anxious that people not get the wrong idea: “I am not particularly interested in guys, but I am interested in dicks. Forbidden taboos lead to all sorts of neurotic behavior, which leads to me being fucked in the ass without a rubber.”

Are the AVN Awards possibly rigged? Max Hardcore (he of the purloined statuette, keep in mind) calls the Awards “a total conflict of interests.” After all, he explains, Adult Video News is heavily ad-dependent,34 and they’re under “pressure from the big hitters like Vivid and VCA to like, you know, give the nod.”

Ms. Ellen Thompson, AVN Associate Editor and an Awards judge who votes under the n.d.g. Ida Slapter:35 “We’ve heard this for years. I hear this complaining also goes on in the mainstream. I don’t like insulting anybody, but sometimes there’s sour grapes. What are we supposed to say? Vivid and VCA put out good product. We truly, honestly do vote fairly.”

Mr. Dick Filth: “The best perception, backed up by tons of anecdotal evidence, is that they are totally, totally fixed and rigged.”
Saturday’s the big night. The banquet, the onstage entertainment, the headline Awards. See & be seen. Gamblers and conventioneers and mooks of all ilk are massed at the Caesars cabstand to watch the starlets arrive. There are camcorders and flashbulbs but no paparazzi per se. Some of the performers come in limos, others in shiny penile sports cars; others seem to mysteriously just suddenly appear. There are even more starlets here than there were at the CES, and they are seriously dolled up. There are cerise halters and pear-colored Lycra bodysuits with open-toed pumps of burgundy suede. There are platinum lamé gowns slit all the way to the tenth rib. Bottoms less covered than shellacked look like they by all rights should have panty- or at least thong lines but do not have such lines. There are lime-green vinyl leotards and toile bellbottoms and fishscale bustiers and miniskirts the same texture and length as a tutu’s ruffle. Garter straps flash and Merry Widow bodices shade the interiors of translucent blouses. Several of the outfits defy very basic precepts of modern physics. Coiffures are towering and complex. The starlets are all on the arms of men, but none of these escorts are male porn performers. Average heel-height is 4""+. A loud-voiced civilian in the cabstand crowd actually utters the phrase “Va Va Voom,” which yr. correspondents had never before heard anywhere outside a Sinatra movie. Breasts are uniformly zeppelinesque and in various perilous stages of semiconfinement. Max Hardcore is under a Stetson the color of weak chocolate milk, and his adjustable B-girl—arrayed in a type of scarlet cowboy suit that’s mostly fringe—has inflated her breasts to what’s got to be maximum capacity.

Woodman-wise, black is clearly In at the 15th Annual AVNAs. A lot of the men are in black tuxedos and black ties and black dress shirts. One is wearing a paisley suit of either serge or some kind of upholstery material. Another has silver platform shoes and a silver vest w/ no shirt underneath. The XPlor boys are in Klein sweatshirts and urban-camouflage fatigues, and there’s a large contingent with them that may or may not include the South Park brain trust. A guy on the arm of Ms. Morgan Fairlane has an immense and razorous violet mohawk à la British punks of the late 1970s.

Inside the hotel, a kind of impromptu cocktail party forms in the broad marble hall outside Caesars Palace’s largest and reportedly classiest ballroom, which is called Caesars Forum. Burly casino staffers stand taking tickets and being very discouraging about anybody trying to bum-rush the show. The crush of bodies out here entails a degree of physical contact that CES mooks never even dreamed of. There are pockets of klieg-glare as cable TV reporters interview various performers about (sic:) the air of keen excitement in the air. Mysterious bundles of co-ax emerge from under the Forum doors and go all the way up the length of the hallway and disappear around the corner. A suspicion that we’d had all week but decided was unverifiable is now instantly verified when one of yr. corresps. gets accidentally shoved against a starlet and is jabbed in the side by her breasts and it hurts. A lot of people are holding drinks in plastic glasses and it’s unknown where they got them. The starlets take turns getting interviewed re atmospheric excitement while the woodmen all avoid the cameras like mafiosi. The TV lights are not doing anyone’s skin tone any good at all. In their all-black tuxes, several of the male Insiders—including e.g. John Leslie and Tony Tedeschi—are so pallid and sallow as to appear diseased. Mr. Nick East devotes a full 5.5 minutes of rapt concentration to the cuticle of his left thumb. A slight surprise is that a lot of the industry’s elite woodmen are short—5'6"", 5'7""36 —and most of their companions tower over them. Dick Filth confirms that the contemporary industry’s 5'6"" standard helps a prodigious male organ look even more prodigious on videotape, a medium that apparently does all kinds of strange things to perspective.

Tickets for Saturday’s main event are $195 per, in advance. It’s unclear whether any Insiders’ tickets are comped, but journalists pay full retail. Our tickets designate our table as #189. Twenty-five hundred tickets have been sold, and since it’s highly doubtful that anybody got past the flinty-eyed casino guys outside without a ticket, tonight’s attendance can confidently be fixed at 2,500.
The Caesars Forum ballroom itself is a huge L-shape with the stage at the—as it were—joint; thus half of the 15th Annual AVN Awards’ audience is geometrically invisible to the other half. This problem is addressed via six sail-sized video screens that hang from the ceiling at strategic points throughout the auditorium. During the nearly two hours37 between when the doors open and the Awards show actually starts, the screens alternate quick clips from porn classics38 (recall that the theme of the 15th AAVNAs is “The History of Adult”) with live shots of various people making their entrances and mugging for the remote cameras AVN has got circling the room.

Both Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth have come equipped with binoculars (H.H.’s in a very official-looking Audubon Society case), which seems mysterious until we all arrive at Table 189, which is at the very, very back of the ballroom’s L’s northern leg, hundreds of yards from even the nearest video screen. “They always put the print guys out in mookland,” Hecuba explains. This fact is unpleasant surprise #1. Unpleasant surprise #2 is the supper the $195 includes, which turns out to be buffet-steam-table-style and might best be described by inviting you to imagine a very cosmopolitan and multiethnic hospital cafeteria. 39 Several of the male Insiders, we now notice, have brought in their own picnic hampers.

Now moving w/ laden plate to a table near us is a man in a full-body leopardskin suit whose way of acknowledging people he knows is to point at them rather than wave at them. On his arm is a B-girl in a body stocking made of what appears to be a densely woven net. Two Astral Ocean Cinema contract starlets have on identical copper-colored beaded gowns with myriad lengthwise slits in the skirt parts’ fronts and backs and sides, so that as they walk to their table their upper halves look normal and their lower halves seem to be passing through an infinity of bead curtains. Obviously, the whole scene is overwhelming. The average American rarely gets to see aerobic legwarmers with 4"" spike heels. The Caesars Forum ceiling is the color of rancid meringue; it has 24 chandeliers that are designed to look like concentric opened fans but actually look more like labia or very well-organized fungus. Mr. Joey Buttafuoco is in the house, accompanying40 Al Goldstein of Screw, who is here to receive a Special AVN Achievement Award for His Lifelong Defense of the First Amendment. Black is so resoundingly In this year that even the starched linen napkins at everyone’s place settings are black. The wineglasses all have little frosted cameos of J. Caesar on them. Humorless men with walkie-talkies stand guard at each of the ballroom’s fire doors—apparently last year there were some problems with unauthorized Caesars Palace employees sneaking in to watch the gala. The video screens are now showing the climactic scene of Debbie Does Dallas, the one where the nebbishy little stand-in for all mooks everywhere finally has sex with Bambi Woods and then the screen flashes “NEXT?” The South Park boys are indeed in attendance, up at Table 37 w/ Farrel and the XPlor coterie. There are also rumors that Boogie Nights auteur Paul Thomas Anderson possesses a ticket to the gala and might show up.41

The closest thing to any kind of Insider table near ours is #182, which according to its black table-tent is reserved for Anabolic Video (not an industry force) and is currently occupied by a spiriferously coiffed and sullenly chewing Dina Jewel (who declines to return Harold Hecuba’s blown kiss) and her escort, a young fellow whom one can easily envision head-butting somebody in a mosh pit. D. Filth confides that this Anabolic guy is a close friend of woodman Vince Vouyer (again, sic), who himself is not up for many ’98 Awards because he spent a good part of the past year in court and/or detention for helping operate an escort service which authorities alleged was not a bona fide escort service at all.

It turns out that Hecuba and Filth have kept from yr. correspondents as unpleasant surprise #3 the single chintziest thing about the $195-a-head 15th AAVNAs banquet & gala: Beverages are not compris. And not just alcohol, either; even a lousy club soda w/ lime42 is $6.00. Worse, it turns out you can’t run any sort of tab—you have to pay the waiter in cash when you order the lousy club soda w/ lime, and he (theoretically) brings your change back with the beverage. Thus a separate and memory-intensive transaction is required for each drink that each of the six-to-eight persons at each of the appr. 375 tables in the auditorium might order, with additional complications if certain people are buying drinks for certain tablemates but not for certain other tablemates, etc.43 The whole unfree-drink situation is incredibly annoying, not only because of the outlandish ticket price but because the ballroom’s 100 percent Middle Eastern waiters (decent and hardworking fellows all, to be sure, who are taking some serious abuse about the pay-as-you-go beverage policy from mooks with cigars at the nearby tables, despite the fact that the waiters don’t make the rules and must surely find having to remember and make change for six to eight different customers per table a piercing pain in the ass44 ) have only rudimentary ESL skills and tend to confuse both drink orders and currency denominations. Dick Filth leans over and shouts: “Now you can maybe see why this is a multibillion-a-year industry—they’re tight as a duck’s butt!”45

The crowd lingers over hypersucrotic cake and coffee and $9.00 cordials and howls conversation at itself for 90 more minutes before the house lights dim and the 15th Annual AVN Awards gala starts. What follows thereon is a kaleidoscopic flux of stilted acceptances and blue one-liners and epileptic strobes and spotlights following winners’ serpentine and high five-studded paths to the stage, of everything from generic Awards Show schmaltz to moments of near-Periclean eloquence, as in e.g.:

“Fellow MENSA members and aficionados of Shakespeare!” intones Al Goldstein of Screw, 62 and obese and white-bearded and crazy-haired and dressed in a sportcoat whose lapels are two different primary colors, looking pretty much exactly like that one certain old guy in the neighborhood your mom warned you never to try to sell Cub Scout chocolate mints to, and glorying in a Special AVN Achievement Award he confesses to feeling he’s long deserved. “I want to thank my mother, who spread her legs and made all this possible.” Large sections of the crowd are on their feet—Goldstein is a porn icon. He was distributing NYC’s Screw on photostat when most of the people in this room were still playing with their toes. He’s been a First Amendment ninja. He drinks in the applause and loves it and is hard not to sort of almost actually like. He’s clearly an avatar of contemporary porn’s unabashedness, its modern Yeah-OK-I’m-Scum-but-Underneath-All-Your-Hypocrisy-So- Are-You-and-at-Least-I-Have-the-Guts-to-Admit-It-and-Have-a-Good-Time persona:

“I salute the women with eleven-IQs and the men with eleven-inch cocks. The real heroes are the cocks and pussies who fuck on-screen. They’re the real heroes.” Goldstein is less conducted than borne back to his seat.

This has followed Robert Schimmel’s intro and a 20-minute “Musical Salute to the History of Adult,” in which topless dancing girls do a medley of disco, new wave, and so on.46 The stage band is ragged and unevenly amplified, and they all have flared collars and tight perms—it’s like watching The Brady Bunch’s final season through borrowed binoculars. The stage is lit by autotrack spotlights whose colors alternate w/o discernible scheme.

The whole 15th AAVNAs Show lasts 3.5 hours and resembles nothing so much as an obscene and extremely well-funded high school assembly. The mix of garish self-congratulation47 and clumsy choreography is often so weird as to be endearing. There are never fewer than six presenters for each award, and they never seem to know whose turn it is to announce a nominee, and there are always a couple who don’t get close enough to the mike to be audible and a couple others who get too close to the mike and produce a jolt of feedback that sends people and cocktails flying out of chairs in the first rows of tables. Wicked Pictures’ Satyr, a multiple-category nominee, gets repeatedly pronounced “Satter.” Winners are supposed to exit stage-left after their acceptance speeches, but even people who’ve won and been through the process several times in recent years keep forgetting and trying to exit stage-right and colliding with the hostesses who are there to escort them leftward. Some presenters insert brief rote antidrug messages into their intros, while around them twitch and sniff other presenters—not many, but some—who are obviously coked to the gills.

Probably the most neutral and economical thing to say is that large parts of the ceremony are unintentionally funny. Winning woodmen extend earnest thanks to directors and execs for giving them “an opening” or “a shot” or “my big shot” and seem wholly unaware of the carnal entendres involved. Back at the journalists’ table with us is a 40ish woman in two-piece Armani who’s doing a spot on the Awards for ABC Radio; she spends most of the evening hunched over with her head in her hand and her tape recorder not even on. Dick Filth spends the show’s whole second hour trying to track down a waiter who owes him beverage change. AVN’s Gene Ross pays tribute to ’98’s Male Performer of the Year by saying: “You haven’t lived until you’ve seen Tom Byron’s wrinkled nuts on a seventy-inch TV screen.” Rob Black’s Miscreants keeps getting nominated in category after category, and time and again there’s a frantic caucus at the podium about the correct pronunciation of miscreant, complete with a couple of presenters audibly whispering what in the fuck is the word even supposed to mean.48

To be fair, some of the nominated products’ titles are genuinely confusing. Triple Penetration Debutante Sluts 4 is up for Most Outrageous Sex Scene—along with Wild Bananas on Butt Row and 87 and Still Bangin’—but loses out to a scene the Program entitles “Anal Food Express”49 from a video called My Girlfriend’s Girlfriend. Paul Thomas’s Bad Wives wins Best Film. Evil Angel’s Buda wins Best Shot-on-Video Feature. The Best Foreign Release statuette goes to something European called President By Day, Hooker By Night. Bad Wives also wins Best Actress/Film for Dyanna Lauren, Best Supporting Actress/Film for Melissa Hill, and Best Anal Sex Scene/Film50 for Lauren and Steven St. Croix. Best Compilation Tape honors go to The Voyeur’s Favorite Blow Jobs & Anals. David Cronenberg’s mainstream Crash comes out of absolutely nowhere to win something called Best Alternative Adult Feature Film. Ms. Stephanie Swift wins Best Actress/Video and tells the crowd: “Thanks, everybody. My gang bang was a blast.”51

Max Hardcore, to Table 189’s immense and unkind delight, doesn’t win one single thing.

An actor named Jim Buck wins AVN’s Gay Performer of the Year Award, and you better believe yr. corresps. sit bolt upright when the person who appears onstage to accept the award is a pink and leptosomatic 4'10"" and is wearing an Eton collar and appears, even under 125X binoculation, to be a twelve-year-old boy. And it turns out it is a twelve-year-old boy: It’s Jim Buck’s little brother. “Jim can’t be here tonight because he’s performing in a Shakespeare festival in New Orleans,” the little boy says (correspondential expressions of bug-eyed inquiry at Hecuba and Filth—Shakespeare festival? sending a prepubescent relative to collect your excellence-in-filmed-sodomy prize?—are met with bemused shrugs), “but I’m here to thank you on his behalf, and to say that I taught Jim everything he knows.” [Enormous audience laugh and ovation, single spasmodic shudder from hunched ABC Radio lady.]

A strange and traumatic experience which one of yr. corrs. will not even try to describe consists of standing at a men’s room urinal between professional woodmen Alex Sanders and Dave Hardman. Suffice it to say that the urge to look over/down at their penises is powerful and the motives behind this urge so complex as to cause anuresis (which in turn ups the trauma). Be informed that male porn stars create around themselves the exact same opaque affective privacy- bubble that all men at urinals everywhere create. The whole Caesars Forum’s men’s room’s urinal area is an angst festival; take it from us. The sink-and-mirror-and-towelette area, however, turns out to be a priceless mash of Insider jargon and shoptalk, all made extra-resonant by echolalic tile and a surfeit of six-dollar drinks. One performer-turned-auteur is telling a colleague about an exciting new project:

“Found this Russian, this chick like nineteen, can’t speak a word of English, which for this [ = for the exciting project] is perfect.”

“You going to get in there? Just for maybe like one scene?”

“Nah. That’s the whole point. I’m the director. This is my package now.”

“Oh man though but you got to get in there. Just one scene. Nineteen, no English. Probably got a butthole about this big” [illustrative gesture unseen because auditor is still standing complexly traumatized at urinal].

“Well, we’ll see.” [Mutual laughter replete w/ warmth of genuine friendship, fellow-feeling; exeunt.]

The Awards Show’s planners have obviously studied at the Oscars’ feet. Not only are the high-profile AVNAs held to the end—though with occasional teasers like Best Supporting thrown into the first two-thirds to keep people attentive52 —but the endless lists of categories and nominees are interspersed with little entr’actes of musical entertainment. Ms. Dyanna Lauren, for instance, appears between Best-Selling Tape and Best Foreign Release to sing her original composition “Psycho Magnet,” a hard-rock ballad about being a porn star and getting constantly stalked and harassed by mentally ill mooks. The song’s argumentation strikes yr. corresps. as a bit uneven, but Ms. Lauren struts and contorts and punctuates her phrasing with uppercuts to the air like a genuine MTV diva. The downside is that vocally, even with heavy amplification and digital synthesis, Dyanna Lauren sounds like a scalded cat, although Dick Filth points out that so does Alanis Morissette, and H. Hecuba chimes in by shouting: “Say whatever you want about the song-and-dance numbers here, they sure beat what Wahlberg and Reilly were coming up with in Boogie Nights!”

Hecuba’s claim seems unassailable until right before the Best Boxcover Concept category, when suddenly a piano is wheeled out for a chinless middle-aged man in the same sort of undersize porkpie that Art Carney always wore in The Honeymooners. This entertainer, who is introduced as “Doctor Dirty—the Dirtiest Musician in the History of Music,” proceeds to belt out obscene parodies of popular ditties that put Table 189 in mind of Mad magazine if everyone at Mad somehow all lost their mind at the same time. “Just got home from prison./My asshole is fizzin’./Goo goo goo drippin’ out my back door” is the only snatch of actual lyrics that persists in memory, though titles like “Sit on a Happy Face” and “It’s a Small Dick After All” have proved maddeningly hard to forget. Nobody at or around our table has ever heard of Doctor Dirty before, but almost everyone agrees that he’s the ’98 gala’s low point and a credible rival for Scotty Schwartz’s 1997 seminude rendition of “Thank Heaven for Little Girls” as the most repellent AVNA interlude in modern memory. There’s also the ’98 ceremony’s climax, in which Midori53 and two other starlets take the stage as “the Spicy Girls” and do a rappish 4/4 number that ends with pretty much every female porn performer in the crowd54 up on stage dancing lasciviously and blowing kisses at the AVN cameras. This climactic distaff shindig apparently caps the Awards every year.

Something else happens every year. It’s never part of AVN’s videotape of the gala, but it’s a tradition that finally explains why the ballroom’s poor waiters are willing to spend five hours enduring beverage abuse and scuttling around to find change. After the Awards Show is over and the lights go up, some of the starlets always pose for obscene snapshots with the Forum’s waiters. A lot of this year’s picture-taking happens at the back, right near our table. One waiter stands with his arm around the shoulders of Leanna Hart, who pulls down the starboard side of her strapless taffeta and allows the waiter to cup her right breast while Table 189’s own personal waiter55 snaps the photo. Another waiter goes around behind Ms. Ann Amoré—a very personable black lady with a 50-inch bust and gang tattoos all down both arms—and hunches over behind her as she bends forward and releases her breasts from confinement, and the waiter paws them and tries to look like he’s having intercourse with her from behind as his friend’s flash goes off. What the waiters are going to do with these photos is unguessable, but they’re visibly thrilled, and the starlets are patient and obliging with them in the same blank, distant way that they were with the mooks at the Adult CES.

Trying to leave after the AAVNAs gala is another slow process, because the broad hallway outside the ballroom is again filled with industry people with Caesar-cameo’d glasses they’ve somehow forgotten to leave at their tables, all standing in clumps and congratulating one another and making plans for various Insider parties later. But the slowest, scariest egressive part is traversing the long glass vestibule to the hotel’s side exit. A mass of fans and Caesars Palace custodians and assorted other civilians are there, and the crowd parts slightly to allow a narrow passage for the Awards’ attendees, who must run this gauntlet nearly single file. It’s late, and everyone’s tired, and this crowd has none of the awestruck reticence of the cabstand’s spectators earlier. Now it’s like every mook has his own special high-volume comment for the passing stars, and there’s a weird mix of adulation and derision:

“Love you, Brittany!”

“How’d you get that dress on, baby?”

“Look over here!”

“Does your mother know where you’re at right now?”

One florid 30ish man holding a plastic cup of beer now reaches out from the crowd and very deliberately pinches the breast of the B-girl walking just in front of us. She slaps his hand away without breaking stride. Because we cannot see her face, we don’t know whether there is any reaction there at all. We have an informed guess, though.

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9""]
I write for Sean Price and Dilla, my mic is Thriller
My ratchet blows, it's trappin' souls like Bryson Tiller
They sprayed the crib, left lead in the awnings
And that's the very thing that gets me out the bed in the mornin'
I got the bread in the corner, got my career in the sauna
I got no fear, just honor, I bled and lived through trauma
First, the Fat Boys break up, then Bow Wow retires
And now y'all disrespectin' the King
I come through there with the street sweeper for niggas
Claimin' they doin' dirt and get to just disinfectin' the scene
I'm what you call the epitomizer of gettin' dark
I will spit a geyser
That'll give these guys on the charts the vitiligo of bars
I'm feelin' like the Don on the permanent throne
Weed like the Qu'ran, burn it, you can get stoned
It's smellin' like a megaphone in the coupe
Go into the extra zone in the booth, flow in the tool
The headphones, the microphone, and the new poems approve
I'm the best to ever put breaths on the measure
Metronome in the loop
All I can do is turn your sister to my all-night masseuse
Zonin' to Gu', this is my moment of truth

Can I rock it? Yes, you can
Now, can I rock it? Yes, you can

Since the day I came in this game
And I just come in here to stay til' I'm crippled
I'm a combination of Kane, G-Rap, Reggie Noble, and James
Who still has Ashanti and Kelly Rowland in dreams
They tried to blackball me, but couldn't, I was too fuckin' good
They tried to run me out of my city, I was too fuckin' hood
So, all I'm tryin' to say (say) to artists tryin' to kill me is
""Hey! Even Patron had to stand in line and wait""
This is God's work handcrafted by karma
I'ma always be here laughin' and clownin', last til' I promise
And last but not least, I'ma finally retire my dad
From out that post office, and that's on my mama
I live my life for my girls and my boys
And I took my soul back from the devil

I'm sitting here remembering, trying to drink away my tears
But the dreams won't die easy, I'll be dreaming them for years

You can call me blue, you can call me untrue
You can call me wrong even if the love is gone
You can call me friend till the very end
Anytime you got an extra dime, call me sometime

Could've called me fool, you should've called me mad
But you didn't have to call if off, you made me feel so bad

Or my daughter, so I’m boiling this water
The scales was lopsided, I’m just restoring order
Hold up, here comes grandma, what’s up Yaya?
What’s that smell? Oh, I’m just boiling some agua

The streets raised me, pardon my bad manners
I got my liberty chopping grams up
Street justice, I pray God understand us

Shouts and battle cries from ev'ry part
I can see those tears, ev'ry one is true
When the door appears I'll go right through

I stand in liquid light, like ev'ryone
I built my life with rhymes to carry on
And it gives me hope to see you there
The things I used to know, that one fine-

One fine day
One fine day

In a small dark room, where I will wait
Face to face I find, I contemplate
Even though a man, is made of clay
Ev'rything can change, one fine-

One fine day...

Then before my eyes is standing still
I beheld it there, a city on a hill
I complete my tasks one by one
I remove my masks when I am done

Then a piece of mind fell over me
In these troubled times, I still can see
We can use the stars to guide the way

Instead of sayin, ""Damn, he did this, he did this,""
Just be like, ""DAMN! He grew out of that? He came out of that?""

Cause how we supposed to know that what we dream is possible
If don't nobody that looks like us makes it?
You only got one life, don't waste it
I mean we only got one night, get wasted
I mean I know you're trying to think it out
But go with what you feel cause real problems can't be calculated
It's hard to find the answer when they have no explanation
It's hard to find where you're headed when there's no destination
It's hard to know when we're going when there's no expiration
So until that day, just keep that Kells inside your playlist and

[Hook]
Bring those speakers up on blast, play it all night long
Bring those speakers up on blast, play it all night long
Bring those speakers up on blast, play it all night long
Bring those speakers up on blast, play it all night long

[Verse 2]
Drinking whiskey like a desperado
My bitches drinking Reposado
Ashing in an empty bottle
Listening to the songs that put our asses in this empty condo
Remember ridin' 'round in Ashleigh's car though?
When the radio first played our song though?
Or at her house when MTV first showed my face
That clip was crazy, I swear it felt like we won the lotto
But a million bucks can't buy priceless moments
An a million people may not know us
But every one of us wants this gift we own
And that is: how is how to keep it real
How to never judge somebody by their steering wheel
Cause you know that mother fucker in that Ford Taurus
Could be the next mother fucker in that new Porsche
But like I said it's hard to know where you're headed
When there's no destination
So until that day, just keep that Kells inside your playlist and

[Hook]
Bring those speakers up on blast, play it all night long
Bring those speakers up on blast, play it all night long
Bring those speakers up on blast, play it all night long

[Outro]
This shit right here, man, this shit feels right! Aye Dub! Aye Dre! Aye Irv! you know it’s all year right? Hah! I'm sitting here in the middle of New York City, the night before I gotta turn my second album in, higher than a motherfucka, drunker than a motherfucka, with my boys, and I’m thinking, damn, man 5 years ago, we were dead broke chilling in Cleveland everyday, and the next thing you know, people are calling us about record deals. And you know, the crazy part is, Ashleigh rented this white Nissan Altima for me and Slim so we could drive out to New York. I think she had to some work some shit or something, so she couldn’t go so we were gonna go out there and see what these labels were talking about. And I’m driving us there, but my license’s suspended so I tell Slim, I'm like “Yo, I gotta pull up before we get to New York and switch, so you can drive in case we get pulled over"" cause we got pulled over the last time we went there. But you know, he had a license so it made sense for him to drive so cut to like 7 and a half hours later, I'm pulling over in this emergency lane and right as I’m opening the door to switch with Slim, boom! This fucking car going full speed on the highway swerves off the road and smashed into us. Yo, I swear to God I woke up half my body’s laying outside the car in the ditch, like 15-20 feet away from where we just were. The car was totalled, the windows were smashed, it was cold as fuck, it was raining outside, but we were actually okay. I mean, my boy had to go the hospital you know the ambulance came and shit, he ended up being alright, but our meeting’s with the record label started at 2 and we didn’t have no car, and now we were stuck in a fucking hospital in New Jersey. So this dude that, I ended up partnering with later on, his name’s James McMillan, he comes and gets us to these meetings and shit, somehow, someway. I don’t know if it was just because we just got into a crazy car crash and could’ve died a couple of hours ago but I'm in there and like you know I’m not feeling this shit man I’m not feeling this record label shit and we drove back to Cleveland. Now I'm back in Ashleigh's mom's basement, I'm thinking about life, you know, I'm on a shit ton of vicodin cause the doctors at the hospital you know gave us something cause we got into that car accident and Ashleigh runs downstairs and she’s like “Yo, yo, Kells, Kells, you're not gonna believe who wants to talk to you right now."" I’m like, ""who?” She’s like “He’s gonna call you in 30 seconds."" Now I guess, when I was in New York, I had made some kinda noise cause this dude named Byron who ended up becoming my manager later on took this video I had called “Chip off the Block” over to Bad Boy and showed Harve Pierre and Harve Pierre went and showed that vid to a guy named Puff, so I answer my phone, depressed, down, fucked up on vicodin and I hear: “Please hold, I have Mister Sean Combs for you."" I said, god damn, life’s about to change, man, I felt it. And sometimes thats all it takes, it’s just that feeling you know what I mean. I knew I was gonna be here, and now I’m here

229,Darlin',"[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yeah, look
If I were to rap about the crap that's out
That's the route you probably want me to take
‘Cause you're just dyin' to know what I think
Hear my take on some other rappers
If I was to say somethin' about Paul Wall
You'd probably crap in your pants, ‘cause I'm white and he's white
So he's like my competition, I mean, right?
Nope! Paul Wall is dope, and so is Bubba
So b-b-b-b-b-b, but I don't compete with nobody
I just go hard, do the rope-a-dope Ali shuffle
And dance around my opponents, do donuts
Sometimes I play possum, like I'm asleep, it's awesome
I'm like a sleepin' giant, and when I awake I'm like Dre
I just jump from outta nowhere and bite prey
And sink my teeth in 'em, and fill 'em
Full of poison, and make a noise like a snake before I kill 'em
And let 'em know that I just don't feel 'em
And smack 'em with the backward E, the Eminem emblem
I was taught if you gonna murder somebody you should face him
Tell him why, look him dead in the eye, then waste him
And the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell
Then swallow the shell, all the hollow who dwell
In the shadows of all who are willing to sell their souls
For this rap game and it g-g-goes
One-two-three, chk-chk, one-two-three
Chk-chk, one-two-three, that ain't the hook, now follow me
There's nothing else for me to say, my public adores me
Everybody bores me, they're just so corny
So at night before I sleep, I look in the mirror
The mirror grows lips and it whispers: ""Come nearer!""

[Chorus: Eminem]
My darling, I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling
‘Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling

""But I'm here to rebuild you,"" — but I already killed you!
""But Shady, we were meant for each other
Think about your mother,"" — yeah, so what of her?
""You think about what she did to you and your little brother
All them foster homes,"" — fuck you, motherfucker!
I had you beat! — ""No, I was playin' possum
Remember? I let you watch your little girls blossom
I gave you enough time, your soul's mine
I'm taking it back,"" — you fuckin' bitch, why?!

""Shady, listen! (Shady!) You hear that?
They're screaming for you, I can bring your career back!""
But I don't want it back — ""Yes, you do,"" — no, I don't
""Yes, you do! You're gonna regret it later,"" — no, I won't
""I'ma get Dre on the phone, I'll just call the Doctor""
Go ahead, I already talked to Dre yesterday
""Well, I got him on the phone right now!""
(Slim!) You're lying! (Yo, Slim!) How, why now?
What up, Dre? (Check this out, Slim, I gotta talk to you
I don't know, it just seems like ever since you got off your
Drugs you became a lot softer)
But Dre, all that Shady is, is a bottle of hair bleach and vodka
(Well, just think about it, Slim, I'm here
Just hit me back and let me know what's up) — fuck this mirror!
""I'm not in the mirror, I'm inside you
Let me guide you,"" — fuck you! Die, you son of a bitch!
""Put the gun down!"" — bye-bye! Boom!
Okay, I'm still alive, — ""So am I too!
You can't kill a spirit even if you tried to
Ha-ha, you sold your soul to me, need I remind you?
You remember that night you prayed to God
You'd give anything to get a record deal? Well, Dre signed you
This is what you wanted your whole life, Marshall, right? Ooh
Look at this house, look at these cars: they're so nice, woo!
Oh, but you didn't know fame has a price too?
That you just now seeing the downside to
Lose your best friend from high school, your wife too
Ain't even sure if your kids like you
Come off tour, can't even sleep at night without NyQuil
Become a Valium addict, start a rehab cycle
But together we can break the cycle

236,(Call Me) When The Spirit Moves You,"[Verse 1]
I feel lost
Conflicting thoughts course through
Clarity, she's gone
Don't know a thing I thought I knew

Everyone wants to see heaven
But no one wants to say goodbye
Everyone wants to see heaven
But no one wants to die

[Chorus]
Can't escape this feeling (there's a void inside)
Can't escape this feeling (how can I deny?)
I hear voices (voices) in my head
Choices (choices) I can't contend
I hear voices (voices) and they all know your name
They all know your name

[Verse 2]
Trapped inside a cell that I built myself
Felt so very empty, cold, dark, and lost

Everyone wants to know God
But they're afraid of what they'll find
Everyone wants to know God
But they want to live like He died

[Chorus]
Can't escape this feeling (there's a void inside)
Can't escape this feeling (how can I deny?)
I hear voices (voices) in my head
Choices (choices) I can't contend
I hear voices (voices) and they all know your name
They all know your name

[Bridge]
I feel it all, I feel it all around
I heard it call, it doesn't make a sound
Was in my hand and now I see, believe
I hear you left, I know you're here with me

[Chorus]
Can't escape this feeling (there's a void inside)
When the Spirit moves you (how can I deny?)
I hear voices (voices) in my head
Can't escape the Ghost when the Ghost is not dead
I hear voices (voices) and they all know your name
They all know your name

[Outro]
I hear voices (voices) in my head
Choices (choices) I can't contend

237,Whatever You Decide,"You're so afraid of being wrong
Your chances will be gone
Before you choose one
And someone has to lose
It's getting late
So throw it in

'Cause everyone loses
If nobody wins
Whatever you decide
Whatever you decide
It's alright
You can try and play two sides

You won't make love
But you won't have to fight one
It never is clean cut
Black or white
Wrong or right

That high wire you're on
Wears thin 'til it's gone
Whatever you decide
Whatever you decide
It's alright by me

Whatever you decide
Whatever you decide
It's alright by me",Randy VanWarmer,1980,"[77, 77, 87]",3

I told you once, yes, I told you twice
But you never listen to my advice
I catch you walking with that boy again
I'm gonna set you free
Oh, I'm gonna set you free

239,That Lovin' You Feelin' Again,"When I saw you standing there on the street
I found myself by your side
I started wanting you again
There's just no way to hide
From that old loving you feeling again
It's really got me reeling again
It only seems to stop to start
All over again with you
I remember how you always give
That certain look in your eyes
You're not easy to resist
But I just walked on by
With that loving old feeling again
It's really got me reeling again
Only seems to stop to start
All over again with you, loving you feeling with you
We were so close, we were too far apart
I gave you my love, I wanted your heart
Without yesterday haunting the way
Maybe we'd still be together
Sharing that loving you feeling again
It's really got me reeling again
Will it ever stop and not start over again
That loving you feeling again
No matter how much I try this loving you feeling
It's taken such a long time to say goodbye
And getting over you is so hard to do
With this feeling loving you, that loving you feeling again
Loving you feeling again
Loving you feeling again
Loving you feeling again

241,My Mistake,"[Verse 1: Witt Lowry]
Ugh, I don't even know you, but we text and
That turns into sexting, my mind you've been testing
The one thing I lack is a lack of affection
See, just like my math, I've been stackin' my exes
You ain't the one, since you I've been sippin' in some
And you and him ain't everything that you wish that he was
You hit Witt and then quit, so in the long run
You just fuck with my feelings for fun, say it!
You love me right now, well, then prove it to me!
""I promise I'm different,"" That's hard to believe
'Cause you talk, talk, talk, never walk, walk, walk
Guess a lame motherfucker is all you gon' be
Never want to be surface, I swim in the deep
Man, I swim in the deep
Hate on my music, hate on my concepts
Honestly, this is just me being me
So fuck your opinion, I stick to my vision
Makin' this music and all the decisions
I'm sorry, fake friends—I was always too driven
That caused a division, you hate but still listen, it's funny
Rappin' 'bout money makes money
Nowadays everybody wantin' something from me
You stealin' my style, gon' have to tear it from me
I would never dumb it, dumb it down for you dummies, ugh

[Chorus: Trippz Michaud]
Tried to make everybody happy
That was my biggest mistake
I could show you how I feel
Yo, get the fuck up out my face
I'ma blow, run the show
That's something I fuckin' know
I do this all on my own
And the only way we goin' is up
I won't stop for nothing, I say
Yeah, I'ma do this on my own and now I'm
Sick and tired of running away
And the only way we going is up

[Verse 2: Trippz Michaud]
What you hidin' behind that YouTube icon?
Wait until they kill that YouTube icon
Tried to make everyone happier, was I wrong?
People wanna see you fail when you've givin' your all
Waste days if you wordy, but talk's fake
Whole life in the copy-paste
Talkin' 'bout my mistakes, I guess you can't relate
To the path that I shoulda take
It piss you off that I tatted my face
But like I promised that it's real, I'm not fake
You see the hate's just a part of the fame
You see my purpose as a part of the change
You been stuck in your ways, I been riding the wave, yeah!
So many things I've been dyin' to say
What's it take to see what's goin' on in my brain?
I'm doin' well, so I can't complain; I took the pain
And made it art that y'all see it today
You don't like it? You can fuck yourself!
And give opinion to someone else
I made the best of the hand I was dealt
People that talk the most can't handle themself
So you hear about it's annual wealth
Your bad vibes gon' damage your health
Lost in your pride and never asked for help
Look into my eyes and see what they reveal
I'ma be a legend, I promise that for real, yeah

[Chorus: Trippz Michaud]
Tried to make everybody happy
That was my biggest mistake
I could show you how I feel
Yo, get the fuck up out my face
I'ma blow, run the show
That's something I fuckin' know
I do this all on my own
And the only way we goin' is up
I won't stop for nothing, I say
Yeah, I'ma do this on my own and now I'm
Sick and tired of running away
And the only way we going is up

[Verse 3: Witt Lowry]
And I can't wait to go read all your comments
Like, ""Mark only, Mark only talks about girls""
You listened to two songs, man, you are too wrong
Here is my nut for you internet squirrels
I'm spillin' my world, you're spillin' your hate
It's okay, you're a lame motherfucker won't ever relate
I'm a shark in the tank, you're the ship that I sank
I can't rap about money, there's none in my bank
And to think, you'd ever stop hatin'
Biggest mistake was to ever start datin'
That's time that I wasted, no time to be waitin'
I should be at Red Rocks and chillin' with Peyton
I'm waitin' on tables, but waitin' for tables to turn
It's TEAMWITT, motherfucker, 'til death on my urn
Now I'm next to the rest and y'all waitin' your turn
But they want me fail or to crash and to burn, so I
Pour gas on the fire
Motherfuck me? See, your mom is a liar
I'm probably workin' while you go get higher
You lookin' for real, well, see, I'm the supplier
You lookin' for talent, then pray for mitosis, you're hopeless
I'm hopin' you notice, your fan base is fake
And you hope I don't notice you're full of more shit
Than the back of a rodent, go act like you know 'em
Your rappin' is surface, I'm rappin' a poem
A trojan to catch poetry when she blow 'em
I told 'em, we we're gonna get it
Built up a team and a vision and always stick with it
It's funny my style, you bit it
But knowin' how phoney you are, you ain't never admit it
Not hard but go hard when your girl wanna get it
Get hard in the back, of a car do you get it
Don't need your opinion, my life I'ma live it
I told 'em we'd do it and all of us did it
My mind is defined, so my body in tune
I was built in the womb, but my mind on the moon
And I'm locked in my room like a fucking cocoon
When I'm leaving my room, all you rappers are doomed
Witt Lowry, what the fuck you ever heard about me
Keep your bullshit from around me
Two fingers up, you know nothin' about me
And one finger up to a fuck tryna doubt me, ugh!",Witt Lowry,1980,"[96, 98, 81, 81, 82, 84, 84, 89]",8

Might have gone somewhere else instead
It's really amazing how you still can work your way back inside of my head

You say since we're both together
And it's lonesome out tonight
Maybe we can help each other
If you hold me very tight

Love me one more time just for old time's sake
Love me one more time there's no more pride at stake
Love me one more time we can erase all the lonely days
One more time one more time one more time

I wish that I could find the strength
To walk out the door with my pride
But memories of our faded love
Keep pushing the judgment aside
I wish that you would lay down beside me
If only to buffer the pain
There's no one else waiting to fill up my night
And I like a familiar terrain

245,Stranger In My Home Town,"Dave Peverett - Riff Bros. Music - ASCAP

Who's that stranger walking out in the cold?
Standing on the corner with his Kodachrome roll?
He may be a psychopath, he's acting so strange
Lying to himself, saying nothing has changed
He stares across at a house on the block
Trying to find the courage to go over and knock
What will he say when they open the door?
""This was my home, but it ain't no more.""

He can't get Brixton, out of his system
It seems so pathetic, yeah, but it's hard to forget it

Way back in '59, a young boy was crying, he didn't want to leave, but what could he say?
Jumped into the lorry, left there in a hurry, never knowing he'd back some day

Stranger in my home town, I'm just a stranger in my home town
Could this street be a part of me? I can't believe it - this ain't no place to be

Who's that Peeping Tom climbing the wall?
Staring at the back yard, he's gonna fall
He looks so suspicious, I should called the law
I wish I could remember where I've seen him before

Sunrise to sundown, stumbling through London town
He acts like he's stranded, but that's how he planned it

Way back in '59, a young boy was crying, he didn't want to leave, but what could he say?
Jump into the lorry, left there in a hurry, never knowing he'd back some day

I would just say everything's fine, ayy

Talking about things like
Goin' getting tattoos of each other's names
Feel like I'ma go insane now
Got the liquor for the pain now
Feel like everything changed, ayy
I just don't know what to say now
I mean back then we used to be so free

You're smokin' that shit too much, got your bitch ass touched
Sen Dog you can't rap from the guts
And B-Real soundin' like he got baby nuts

I don't know one rapper down wit' your click
I don't know one bitch on your dick
And I don't know one nigga bumpin' your shit

Fuckin' with the hogs
You say you Bloods but you ain't liked by the dogs fool
On tour only rappin' to the yuppies
We the big fish I'll make a dish out you fuckin' guppies
So who are y'all with?
Niggas down with Cypress can wipe this shit off my dick
As I stick it like King Kong and play Ping Pong
With this fake ass Cheech and Chong
Did you tell ya momma that I had to help ya
When Sen Dog left your bitch ass in Australia
You say that I took your hook?
It must be the white boy thinkin' all niggas crooks
Now what, you hip-hop hippies?
How you fuckin' junkies
Think you gonna punk me and chill

To the sigh when you turn out your bed light
From the wound in the side to the day a loved one dies
You know there is nothing you can do to make it right
So you don't call - as you fall
With closed eyes - further behind
And it responds, in a way, to the things that you say
At the dying of the day
(Don’t take your life for granted)

[Chorus]
Open up and lift those pennies from my eyes
I'm on the rebound, the same as you
Open up from your traditional disguise
I'm on the rebound, the same as you
From the badly chosen path to the tears when you laugh
From your yesterdays to all of your tomorrows
From the chains that you strap 'round yourself by the stone
To the song in a moment of sorrow
You take heed - from what you need
And blame it all - on tradition
It responds, in a way, to the things that you say
At the dying of the day

261,Should've Never Let You Go,"When you walk into a room
Your beauty steals my breath away

When you look into my eyes
I find it hard to find the words to say

Wanna run away and hide
I just got to let you know
Feel so tangled up inside
I should have never let you go

(should have never let her go)

Anyone can make mistakes
And we both have made our share

But a life without your love
Is a life too hard to bear

I don't care who's right or wrong
Only know I love you so

Why did I have to write this song
I should have never let you go

Why in all the wide, wide world
Have I run into you here
Wish I could disappear

I'll never understand

I'll never understand

Why I even give a damn

When you walk into a room
You know I stand on shaky ground

I've built so many walls around me
Now the walls are tumbling down

You're the kind I can't forget

Let the tears begin to flow

I have only one regret
I should have never let you.....go
Should have never let you go

Should have never let you go

Should have never let you go

Should have never let you go",Neil Sedaka,1980,"[99, 63, 49, 30, 19, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 30, 33, 40, 44, 52, 59, 70, 80, 90]",19

263,If I Were You,"[Припев]
Если бы я был тобой, я бы злился тоже
Если б трахнул мою суку, я бы злился тоже
Если б ты забрал мой налик, я бы злился тоже
Но я знаю, где ты живёшь, уёбок, словимся попозже
Если бы я был тобой, я бы злился тоже
На твоём бы месте, мэн, я бы злился тоже
Если б ты забрал мой налик,  я бы злился тоже
Но я знаю, где ты живёшь, уёбок, словимся попозже

[Куплет 1]
Когда мы были кореша
Мы разбежались, неизбежно бабки крутят этот шар
Холодная сталь оставляет шрам
У одних вызывает страх, другим даёт свой шанс
Жизнь даёт вам шанс, хватай его сейчас
Мне не нужен твой барыга, оставь его себе на чай
Говорил тебе, парень, с самого начала
Твоя сука зашла «ВКонтакт» и всё себе скачала
Как она кричала, боже, как кончала
Она вся протекла, и ей походу мало
Нет, нет, нет, тебе не поможет мама
Да, да, да, я забрал тебя так рано
Теперь мой счёт прибавил пару нулей
Но я никогда не менял бабки на людей
Бабки - на людей, братьев - на блядей
Ты сучья гнида, мы словимся попозже, всё окей

[Припев]
Если бы я был тобой, я бы злился тоже
Если б трахнул мою суку, я бы злился тоже
Если б ты забрал мой налик, я бы злился тоже
Но я знаю, где ты живёшь, уёбок, словимся попозже
Если бы я был тобой, я бы злился тоже
На твоём бы месте, мэн, я бы злился тоже
Если б ты забрал мой налик,  я бы злился тоже
Но я знаю, где ты живёшь, уёбок, словимся попозже

[Куплет 2]
Сука, ты выродок, сука, ты выблядок
Никто не будет терпеть тебя, никто не будет терпеть твоих выходок
Ты живёшь ради выгоды, мы живём ради выхлопа
Все ваши рэперы в сторонке тихо и нервно курят у выхода
Я нажимаю на «Play» — играет Big Daddy Kane
И, сука, так каждый день, да, мама, я – бэнгер
И мы, словно, бля, в танке, мы заходим за рамки
Ты продался давно, оставь своё музло на платной стоянке
Многие хотят делать этот трэп-щит
Я не слышу их, мэн, кто там пищит?
Просто пойми, ты предназначен для других целей
И просто пойми, мы знаем всю правду, увидишь всё в свете
Эти дети говорят о том, чего никогда не видели в жизни
Посмотри на себя, думаешь, бог приготовил для тебя именно это?
Толкать наркоту на районе? Нет, парень, это не так
Возьми всё в свое руки, будь одержим

[Припев]
Если бы я был тобой, я бы злился тоже
Если б трахнул мою суку, я бы злился тоже
Если б ты забрал мой налик, я бы злился тоже
Но я знаю, где ты живёшь, уёбок, словимся попозже
Если бы я был тобой, я бы злился тоже
На твоём бы месте, мэн, я бы злился тоже
Если б ты забрал мой налик,  я бы злился тоже

Knew you looked girl that's just the way it goes

When you gon' recognize I'm somethin like a star
My crib down the street, we ain't gotta go far
I know I sound wrong, but I'm just bein real

The honey's all gone and the birds talkin 'bout

To see every weekend eatin all my paystub
Always tryin to impress these niggas
With expensive-ass liquor I don't even like the taste of
I think it's sickening
Things we do to see and be seen on the scene
We seem to love it, so lost when the lights go off
We sit and we often wonder what's the meaning of it
It's like nobody want to live they life
They just wanna re-enact the same scene every night
Everybody's sellin fantasies, no matter what the price
Like I'll love you forever, but forever ends tonight

This is the last call, for the jump off express
All potential passengers please leave your pride and dignity in the parking lot
And come holla at the nigga in the red '93 Civic
One deluxe pass, on the jump off express gets you
One meal at the 24 hour restaurant of your choice
Followed by 15 minutes of passion on my momma futon
Those with self-esteem need not apply

275,Ashes By Now,"[Verse 1]
This morning is Monday, where are you now?
Teasing my memory
Teaching me how to lay low when I don't want to

Well love is elusive, this I know now
It's making me crazy
Leaving me out in the open when I don't want to

The moments of pleasures never do last
They're gone like a suitcase full of your past
Long gone and in a hurry

[Chorus]
Baby, I can't go through this again
I don't need to go down more then I've already been
Just like a wild fire, you're running all over town
As much as you burn me, baby, I should be ashes by now

[Verse 2]
The Second Street beggars alone in their life
Drunk on a sidewalk to hide from the night
Like I am, they're just like I am

[Chorus]
Baby, I can't go through this again
I don't need to go down more then I've already been
Just like a wild fire, you're running all over town
As much as you burn me, baby, I should be ashes by now

Ay, 100 carats on my chest, I'm so true to this
Task force, got my vest, I got a new one bitch
Feds hate and talk shit but I'm too legit
A million dollars at a time - till I'm super rich
Pimp squad, G-Unit, fuck who you get
Ask ya nieces and ya nephews who tha shit
Real niggas see the difference 'tween you and this
Me getting beat down? That's ludicrous!
My name rang from the streets of Spain to Mechanicsville
Nigga, all you gettin' is Rodney Dangerfield
No respect; I'm a vet, you could bet that
I caught some cases but that's just a minor setback
And if I have to do some time, I'll be right back
Wit some bi's and some tri's and a six-pack
We hit the do', watch all the pussy niggas get back
They know we could do it like tha Row, but you ain't wit that
You know who make the track bump like the King of Crunk

G-G-G-unit! Coming straight outta Compton
Lace up my G-6's, and I'm A-Town stomping
Got ten thousand cash in my pocket, let the bump in
Cause Luda and Young Buck always getting me into somethin'
Low rider out front, I'm trying to get into somethin'
Step on Banks shoe one more time and I'ma start busting
Rolls gold in my grill, I got a dirty mouth
And a bitch with a fat ass from the dirty, dirty South
I wasn't tryna get the cover of the Double XL
Just trying to fuck Mya, cause Dre said sex sells
Don't be mad at the rocks in my fucking chain
Don't be mad cuz your bitch chose Buck and Game
You see the logo tatted on my neck
Same one I'm autographing on the chest
Put your bottles in the air for Yayo, he on house arrest
And on behalf of 50 Cent this is G-Unit West

[Verse 4: Ludacris]
Yeah! Muthafucker I'm a monster in this game, similar to the Loch Ness
My rhymes are nappy rooted, some verses gotta process
The truth in this booth; ain't no doubts when I'm rappin'
If I say it, I've either done it or it's 'bout to happen
When I pull up in the Louis truck on 26s, people dumb out
If life's a crap game I'm rollin 7s on the come out
These rappers think I'm ign'ant, love saying my name
Cause maintaining my fish tank and they house cost the same
Ask me I say I made it and it sure wasn't luck
But cause hustlas relate to me and some are younger than Buck
You see I'm married to my music but we got a pre-nup
So if that bitch don't act right, I'm still gettin my cut
My deals never get screwed; my contracts practice abstinence
A master in this program, hazing these undergraduates
So pimpin', be easy; quit catchin' feelings
'Cause you worth a couple 100 grand, and I'm worth millions
Nobody thinkin' bout you; plus your beef ain't legit

Do do do...

First time I saw you, baby
I knew right away
I wanted you for my lady
I had to rush right over to you
And ask you if you felt
The same way, too

Now we've known each
Other many a night
And I want you to know
My intentions are right
For making you my lady
The one and only lady
In my life (in my life)

[Chorus:]
I wanna be two places
At the same time
Inside you and
Inside your mind
Both of these ways
I wanna love you
Cause one without the
Other just won't do

[Chorus:]
I'm so thankful
That I found the woman
Who I can trust
With all my loving

Cause as a love affair
Goes on and on
It takes more than
Good looks to keep
The feeling strong

Personality is a must
Cause after God
Only you I will trust
With my heart, baby
Girl, I offer you
My only heart (my only heart)

[Chorus:]
No, girl
It just won't do, ow

Two places at the same time
Can't be no other way
Cause I made up my mind
You mean more than just fun to me
And that's the reason why
I've got to be two places

Two places, same time
Inside you, inside your mind
Both of these ways
I wanna love you
Cause one without the
Other just won't do

At the same time

Falling back on forever, I wonder what you came to be

The leather seats, the passage rite
I feel the heat, I see the light

Through the desert on a hot night

We were innocent and young

Cast out of the night
You got a foolish heart
So you took your place but the fall from grace
Was the hardest part
It feels just like a dagger buried deep in your back
You run for cover but you can't escape the second attack
Her soul was innocent, she kissed him and she painted it black
You should have seen your little face, burning for love
Holding on for your life

All that I wanted was a little touch
A little tenderness and truth, I didn't ask for much, no
Talk about being at the wrong place at the wrong time

Making out we've got the radio on
You're going to miss me when I'm gone
You're going to miss me when I'm gone

Racing shadows through the moonlight

We were innocent and young

The dust cloud has settled, and my eyes are clear
But sometimes in dreams of impact I still hear
Miss Atomic Bomb, I'm standing here
Sweat on my skin
And this love that I've cradled
Is wearing thin (Miss Atomic Bomb)
But I'm standing here and you are too late
Your shock-wave whisper has sealed your fate

It feels just like a dagger buried deep in your back
(It's so cruel)
You run for cover but you can't escape the second attack
(and you turn your back, you're so)
Your soul was innocent
She kissed him and she painted it black (on a losing game)
You should have seen your little face
Burning for love

Walls windows trees, waves coming through
You be in me and I'll be in you
Together in eternity

Up among the firs where it smells so sweet
Or down in the valley where the river used to be
I got my mind on eternity
Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me

And I'm wondering where the lions are...
I'm wondering where the lions are...

Huge orange flying boat rises off a lake
Thousand-year-old petroglyphs doing a double take
Pointing a finger at eternity
I'm sitting in the middle of this ecstasy

Young men marching, helmets shining in the sun
Polished as precise like the brain behind the gun
(Should be!) they got me thinking about eternity
Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me

And I'm wondering where the lions are...
I'm wondering where the lions are...

The wedding, the ring, the whole dumb thing
I was willing to tie the knot
So I called her up, and this is the answer I got

""I'm so sorry you have just reached my answering machine
I'm not in at present, I'm sure you know this whole routine
Leave your name and number
And I'll try and get back to you
You have thirty seconds to talk to me before you're through""

And I said, ""Baby, let's go get married
Well, I need to know you're mine
I am hangin' on, I am hangin' on
I am hangin' on this line
And if I can leave one message
Before you go to bed
I would say to you...""
And the phone went dead

So I stepped out to buy some dog food for the cat
Of course she called about three minutes after that
Would she be my wife and share my life?
Well, of course you can write the plot
'Cause she called me up, and this is the answer she got

""I'm so sorry you have just reached my answering machine
I'm not in at present, I'm sure you know this whole routine
Leave your name and number
And I'll try and get back to you
You have thirty seconds to talk to me before you're through""

And she said, ""Baby, I got your message
Well, I'm answering your call
I have thought it out, I have thought it out
And I think that all-in-all
If you ask if we can marry, and make it for all time
Then my answer is...""
And the phone went

""I'm so sorry you have just reached my answering machine
I'm not in at present, I'm sure you know this whole routine
I'm so sorry you have just reached my answering machine

Of a worn out relation
Enough of the jealousy

294,Twilight Zone/Twilight Tone,"With a key, you unlock a door to imagination
Beyond it is another dimension
A dimension of sight
A dimension of sound
A dimension of mind

You're moving through a land of both shadow and substance
Of things and ideas
Guiding you through this wondrous journey
Is the hypnotic sound of the twilight tone

When I hear this melody
This strange illusion takes over me
Through a tunnel of the mind
Perhaps a present or future time oh, oh
Out of nowhere comes this sound
This melody that keeps spinning 'round & 'round
Pyramidal locomotion
From a mystic unknown zone

Hearin' the twilight
Hearin' the twilight, twilight tone

Unpretentious girl from Memphis
Saw the future through her third eye
People came with skepticism
Picking, testing her precision, no, wo, oh, oh
Suddenly they heard this sound
This melody that keeps spinning 'round & 'round
A signpost up ahead is calling
Through the mystic unknown zone

Hearin' the twilight
Twilight swept away, feelin' the rhythm
Hearin' the twilight
Twilight swept away, ba da, loo da, ba da loo da
Hearin' the twilight
Twilight tone

Submitted for your approval. One Mr. Miller, who's about
To take a trip into oddness and obsolescene, through a
Zone whose boundaries are that of imagination
Accompanying him on this journey is the mesmerizing
Sound of the Twilight Tone

On a cold & rainy night
One Mister Miller had a rare flight
Glen was up there boppin' a rhythm
Then the engine stopped to listen with him
Play that beat, oh, oh
Suddenly he heard this sound
This melody that keeps spinning 'round & 'round
Now he resides and plays trombone
In the mystic unknown zone

308,Coming Down From Love,"From the beginning
You were my life
And through the seasons
I made the sacrifice
Now I remember
What you did to me before
It keeps bringing me down

And the relation
Tore me apart
You were so clever
Girl it broke my heart
Now I remember
Cause I can't forget the past
It keeps spinning around

Darling somehow
Now that you're gone
I have no one
I write you letters
And throw them away
Only a fool keeps hanging on
When love slips away

Coming down from love
And I wonder why it takes so long
Cause I keep holding on
Coming down from love
And I wonder why it takes so long
Tell me where I went wrong

Through all the changes
Love was so blind
But I continued
Keeping an open mind
Now I remember
Cause I can't forget the past
I keep spinning around",Bobby Caldwell,1980,"[69, 42, 43, 47, 51, 56, 63, 69, 79, 89]",10
309,The Very Last Time,"[Verse 1]
Your eyes don't lie
A pair of daggers cutting through my mind
Your stare it rips a hole into my life
Am I supposed to leave this all behind?
It's on my skin
Your scent is poison when I breathe you in
It's there with every single breath I take
If this is it then don't resuscitate

[Chorus]
I've gone and put myself through this for the very last time
I'm not gonna punish myself when I know that the fault is not mine
It's on my skin
Your scent is poison when I breathe you in
I've gone and put myself through this for the very last time
(For the very last time)

[Verse 2]
Don't you speak
You think I'm hurting but I'm not that weak
I guarantee I won't be losing sleep
'Cause you're the one that made this incomplete

[Chorus]
I've gone and put myself through this for the very last time
I'm not gonna punish myself when I know that the fault is not mine
Don't you speak
You think I'm hurting but I'm not that weak

I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing

310,Only The Lonely (Have A Reason To Be Sad),"[Verse 1 TBE_Jallel]
I saw you yesterday
But it's like I haven't seen you
In a million and 1 years
Good morning I am here
You're lonely in the corner
Wiping your own tears
You're feeling the most unappealing feeling a human being can ever get
You're frustrated
Suffocated
You go out and blow
Those cigarettes
I want to try in help you
But something in my mind is telling me to just freeze and don't


[Verse 2 TBE_Jallel]
Tumblr, food and depression is your only escape
Cat-fished, lying, crying implying lies about your body shape
Fighting for freedom that you already have
Skirling and hurting taking photos of the cuts on your legs in the bubble bath
But is there a reason for you to be this sad

Tell me what to do
Too cure you

You're a different person
When you're off your phone
Don't get me wrong
But it's like you're hurting yourself purposely
Honestly
You look good
When you don't try
Damn
You searchin for the wrong guys
When the one guy
Is right in front of you
In your eyes
Baby tell me what I gotta do
Too cure you
I'll try my best to help
Whelp

This girl got a pink donut
I never like when they got bonus
This bitch I knew
She went through a coma
I'm surprised that I got over
But I had to do if no persona
I feel sad when I see a loner
She
She turned into a lone ass stoner
I can't do it like a bitch woulda
This shit be depressed
Flexed with regret
I can't believed it was my friends death
But then I was correct
That you did and that you left",TBE - TBE_Jallel x TBE_Tony,1980,"[91, 93]",2
311,Sisters Of The Moon,"[Verse]
Intense silence
As she walked in the room
Her black robes trailing
Sister of the moon
And a black widow spider makes
More sound than she
And black moons in those eyes of hers
Made more sense to me
Heavy persuasion
It was hard to breathe
She was dark at the top of the stairs
And she called to me

And so I followed
As friends often do
I cared not for love, nor money
I think she knew
The people, they love her
And still they are the most cruel
She asked me, be my sister
Sister, sister of the moon

Some call her sister of the moon
Some say illusions are her game
They like to wrap her in velvet
Does anyone, ooh, know her name",Fleetwood Mac,1980,"[92, 86, 88]",3
312,I Can't Help It,"[Verse 1]

It's getting better all the time

I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to

I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no

Love to run my fingers
Softly while you sigh
Love came and possessed you
Bringing sparkles to your eyes
Like a trip to heaven
Heaven is the prize
And I'm so glad I found you, yeah
You're an angel in disguise

I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to

Woman me a go away and me naw come back
Stand up at the station with me suitcase packed
Gal how me love you but me naw turn back
Tell me right now, this minute if you coming or not
Stand up at the station at about 6 o'clock
Rain it, a pour and lightning start to flash
I man wonder to myself whether she coming or not
Or it's about time I man wake up and face the fact
Well she find a new love and it's holding her back
That is why I'm standing by myself on the railroad track
Boop boop bop, heart a beat non-stop
There's no wonders or signs are you coming back?

[Chorus: Ken Boothe]
I say the train is coming, baby
I say the train is coming now
Every day I pray for this little hour, ooh yeah

314,Gee Whiz,"Tell me what is it is, Gee Whiz, I don't think I know

[Verse 1]
Well believe me I've tried but there's no explaining
Eyes piled up you look like a painting
Saintly and sexy, the soft-spoken wind blows
Uncertain curtains cover broken windows
In desperate need of a safe haven and inflamed
I walk around Paris, unshaven and ashamed
20 odd years since last time I slow danced
Teenage crisis and the end of romance
I see myself in the form of a wolf
Furry down on all fours and worried
Uneven colours and the echoes of fly tones
Connections I've lost in a collection of jawbones
Apples and oranges, you decide which
I'm writing graffiti on suicide bridge
I once knew a woman who was clever and tough
Who said too much make up is never enough
Her eyelids were heavy with words and desire
She lives underwater with the birds and the fire
And it just so happens I'm selling my psyche
If you like love you'll love this, most likely

[Bridge]
You and me are meant to be that's right I love you
Can't you see, whatever partner you do choose you have the ability to marry
6, 7, 8, I'll never hurt you you know
Husbands love their wives
Yeah, love the woman
Part of me is here with you
One life, where my heart beats for you
Well, here we are again
Here's a couple, treacherous
I'm impatient in relationships in and love
When will you see quand allez-vous me voir

[Hookk]
Tell me what is it is, Gee Whiz, I don't think I know

[Verse 2]
Bird girl sorry I'm too sleepy to make
But the sounds of my dreams always keep me awake
Don't wanna scare the birds away so I speak soft
Memories like the shows of Vanessa Beecroft
Her bedroom philosophies are so perplexing
But I think these two wooden legs are so sexy
Cries of sadness spectacular
You be Rossy de Palma and I'll be your Dracula
Fist is of agony decorate the last room
Shoes by the door on the floor is your costume
Open the trunk with the car key, the odd way
Love songs call me the marquee de shad
Lord of the files you lost me I wonder how
Midnight meet me at the entrance for the underground
So many questions but I'm afraid to ask
So I whisper them to apollinaire by Picasso
I touch all the flowers and break the chain
I wish I could fly but I'd rather take the train
And it just so happens I'm selling my psyche

Sunday came and trashed me out again
I was only having fun
Wasn't hurting any one
And we all enjoyed the weekend for a change

[Verse 2]
I've been stranded in the combat zone
I walked through Bedford Stuy alone
Even rode my motorcycle in the rain
And you told me not to drive
But I made it home alive
So you said that only proves that I'm insane

Remember how I found you there
Alone in your electric chair
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled
You were lonely for a man
I said take me as I am
Cause you might enjoy some madness for a while

Now think of all the years you tried to
Find someone to satisfy you
I might be as crazy as you say
If I'm crazy then it's true
That it's all because of you

318,The Seduction (Love Theme),"[Intro]
Oh, listen up
Young man, there's a—there's a young man, he writes stories
He's a writer, a little writer boy
He falls in love with a girl, girl already has a boyfriend
She kinda loves him back, but not really
They're just really good friends, and that's fine
He understands, it's rational

[Verse 1]
Hi, what's your name? How are you? How’s your life?
Oh, you got a man? Are you in love? If so, what type?
Is it just platonic, strictly just as friends
Or the type that ties you two together 'til tomorrow’s end?
If it is, disregard every time I call you pretty
Though it’s meant sincerely, it’s just my imagination drifting
Brush me off like the dirt on Jay-Z’s shoulders
So I fall to ground, collect myself and get ready to take over your heart
Or at least your spare time

[Chorus]
And I love the thought of being with you
Or maybe it’s the thought of not being so alone!
Hey, the second one’s way sadder than the first one
But I don’t know
I love the thought of being with you
Or maybe it’s the thought of not being so alone!
The second one’s way sadder than the first one
But I don’t know

[Verse 2]
We should go and get a friggin' cup of coffee
And I’ll act friendly and I won’t pull any stunts
But I’m a little stunt puller from birth
So I don’t know what to tell you
If I try to confess my love for... scones
I just wanna say something real quick, please shh, listen
I love... these scones
Just the diversity between the selection they have here
The blueberry, the raspberry, strawberry, pumpkin
Even which is basically a friggin' squash
How they gonna make a scone out of a freaking squash?
Oh, wow, wow
That shit blows my mind
That's Elon Musk just in his little lab cooking up, baby
But what were you talking about?
Oh yeah, your boyfriend made you mad the other day?
What was he saying? Oh, what do I think? Hm...
He was being mean at that part—point?
But I'm sure he's gonna turn around at some... point, as well
And

[Chorus]
I love the thought of being with you
Or maybe it’s the thought of not being so alone!
The second one’s way sadder than the first one
But I don’t know
I love the thought of being with you, whoa, whoa, whoa
Or maybe it’s the thought of not being so alone!
Shit, I love being—I love being loved, but
Don't like crying on the phone

[Verse 3]
Hi, wassup?
Yeah, what’s going on?
Oh yeah, she told me a lot about you, yeah, uh-huh
It’s so great you’re doing all of those things
You should keep doing all of them I think
Oh yeah, my name’s Hobo Johnson
People like to say I'm a rapper, I'm actually not
I produced this myself, I'm hella fucking proud of it
But yeah, she like—she's so nice
She was so nice and cared about me, no one else did
Literally, I don't think I've ever felt love before that
She's a peach... scone
She's a peach scone, yes
And

[Outro]
I love the thought of being with her
I just really hope that she doesn't get hurt, y'know?
They say it takes two years to come back down to Earth
From that lovely place that you’ve been, I heard it’s so nice
Good for you guys, I'm—I'm glad (Being so alone!)
And if you find someone who loves you for who you are
Keep loving 'em, man
'Cause that shit happens like, once in a lifetime, y'know?
And who am I to get in the way of someone living their lifetime Y'know?
And I hope you're doing really well, I haven't talked to you in a while
But uh, I found someone else who really loves me for who I am
But I don't call them enough, and that's why they moved away
I'm gonna call them right now, she wants me to call her

All the same to me all the same to me
Yes all the same
Time means nothing
Time means nothing to me anymore

I shut my eyes a second ago
And I was only eight years old
Lying on my back in the sun
Listening to the sound of children playing
And I remember all my thoughts
(thinking how beautiful life was)
So wonderful to be young
So beautiful to be young
Rememebring how, how to be young

One by one, all my friends died
And my body decayed
Time means nothing
Time means nothing to me anymore
I close my eyes, I was learning
A lesson somewhere else
I shut my eyes, I was learning
A lesson somewhere else
Time means nothing
Time means nothing to me anymore

320,Happy Together (A Fantasy),"[Intro: Jonny 5]
Imagine me and you, I do
I think about day and night, it's only right
To think about the girl you love, and hold her tight
So happy together

If I should call you up, invest a dime
And you'd say you belong to me, and ease my mind
Imagine how the world could be so very fine
So happy together

[Verse 1: Jonny 5]
Imagine me and you
I do, but I'm thinking too much and I'm studying how they toss the dice
It had to be simpler back in the day when our folks were pretty certain
They could find someone, now none of it's a sign
We just wanna date, whether deaf or blind or dumb
I look at your number and wonder if I should call you up
And invest a dime in a message with text that doesn't belong to me
But it would ease my mind to know if the songs I'm singing
Are in a key that you can comprehend
In tune with the thoughts you're ponderin'
If so we can both stop wonderin' if and
Be together like Donner and Blitzen
But all reindeer games aside
It's like light when you came here, I came alive
It's like everything else was a glimpse of you
Giving hints and clues to where your name resides
Now that I found you it's changed the vibe
Shattered through all the blame, fear, pain, and pride
Doesn't matter who calls and invests a dime
Get a message saying we're staying inside
'Cause I imagine you and me
Could make music beautifully
Could make moves never lose the beat
I can imagine the food that we choose to eat
I see it all like a view from a movie seat
And imagine you and me
Never knew that we
Were never more than a few degrees
How good it would prove to be
But the waiting is over, I finally found you and

[Hook]
I can't see me lovin' nobody but you, for all my life
When you're with me, Baby, the skies will be blue, for all my life

Me and you, and you and me
No matter how we toss the dice, it had to be
The only one is me for you, and you for me
So happy together

[Verse 2: Brer Rabbit]
Imagine me and you and you and me
No other way for we to be
Toss these dice, eventually
These snake eyes spell a tragedy, and
I release unhappily
This magic now a fantasy
There's another for me than you and
Some other one for you than me, and
If that's the way it has to be
An uncompleted masterpiece
Deleted canvas atrophy
Cut by 'nother after me
A silent wound whose lips confess
Love lost under love's duress
A curse confessing hope and then
Reverse the blessing emptiness
This hollow hole won't coalesce
Regrets emote from hole in chest
As less remote emotions pour
From cavities' growing depths
I have it easy knowing this
Together we will never fit
So I'd rather bind my mind with rhymes
Than blind my eyes and sever it

[Hook]
I can't see me lovin' nobody but you, for all my life
When you're with me, Baby, the skies will be blue, for all my life

Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba-da ba ba-da ba
Ba-da ba bahh

Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba-da ba ba-da ba
Ba-da ba bahh

Me and you, and you and me
No matter how we toss the dice, it had to be
The only one is me for you, and you for me
So happy together
We're happy together
How is the weather?
So happy together

[Outro: Jonny 5]
And I don't know, and I can't think
And I'm so smote that I can't speak
And I look at the picture I have in my head
And I won't doze, and I can't sleep
And it's so good that I'm knocked out
And your quotes get put in my thoughts now
And there's nobody else to distract me
'Cause you've got me on lockdown
And I can't stop
And I won't stop
And we rock on
Even show stop
So thank you for coming tonight everyone, we're the Flobots",Flobots,1980,"[82, 53, 57, 65, 75, 85]",6
321,Back Of My Hand (I've Got Your Number),"You only call me if you're feelin' blue
You tell me I don't pay attention to you
But if you only knew just what I'm goin' through
You wouldn't phone those guys who mess around with you, girl

And when I call you I get stock replies
You work them out before you dry your eyes
I'm not a fruit machine, a 1960's dream
I dreamed about you last night, but you didn't see, girl

You're not unreadable, you're not unbeatable
I know just what you are, don't push your luck too far
You're not untouchable, not just another girl
I'd get in touch with you, I only wish I knew that

I've got your number written on the back of my hand
I've got your number written on the back of my hand
I've got your number written on the back of my hand
I've got your number

I had a dream, I met another girl
But in the morning, she was just a kick inside
I hope I'm gettin' through the interference too
My money is running out, I don't know what to say now
The operator's saying ""Cut the line""
You want to cut it for the very last time
You're only young at heart, but now's a time to start
Just realizing what I've got down here, girl

You're not unreadable, you're not unbeatable
I know just what you are, don't push your luck too far
You're not untouchable, not just another girl
I'd get in touch with you, I only wish I knew that
(Only wish I knew that)

I've got your number written on the back of my hand
I've got your number written on the back of my hand
I've got your number written on the back of my hand
I've got your number

Say, don't you realize?
Is there nothing left inside?
Hey, did I get you wrong?
Say, where's your number gone?

You only call me if you're feelin' blue
You tell me I don't pay attention to you
But if you only knew just what I'm going through
You wouldn't phone those guys who mess around with you, girl

You're not unreadable, you're not unbeatable
I know just what you are, don't push your luck too far

Just because you don't do what you should
You better shape up, or you're gonna fail.""

I can survive just fine
I can survive

They tried to tell me, they tried to sell me
Play music like this, if you want to be smart
But I said, ""Listen, here's what you're missin'
Music's got to have a heart.""
They put me through many changes
Faces and names are clear
But I'll just leave my music
Ringin' louder in their ears

CHORUS

Now you should know just what to do
Don't let other people take advantage of you now
Don't think twice, no don't hesitate
Shoot for the top, you gotta deal with fate

And you seem like a friend to me

In this old hotel
And rooms filled with reckless pride
And the walls have grown sturdy
And the halls have worn well
But there is nobody living inside
Nobody living inside

Gonna pull in the shutters
On this heart of mine
Roll up the carpets
And pull in the blinds
And retreat to the chambers
That I left behind
In hopes there still may be love left to find
Still may be love left to find

Seek inspiration in daily affairs
Now your soul is in trouble and requires repairs
And the voices you hear at the top of the stairs
Are only echoes of unanswered prayers
Echoes of unanswered prayers

And the halls have worn well

You used to think that love was worth the time
When love was all we had
We didn't need distractions all the time
Or being made to laugh

And then you said we had to build a home
And love alone could not provide
You said that money would never get us down
You didn't know you lied

Now loneliness is there despite the love we make
And loneliness knows where to find the friends we make
And the place we live is just a new street number
On an old address called love and loneliness

I sometimes wonder how you see us now
I'd read your mind if I had the chance
I don't know if I'd ever find our love in there
Or just old photographs

And now loneliness is there despite the love we make
And loneliness knows where to find the friends we make
And your friends come 'round and they act amazed
You show them 'round and they stand and praise
The life we live that's just a new street number
On an old address called love and loneliness

They're gonna send you back to Mother in a cardboard box

Please, don't make me beg

Baby, you can believe this if I got to
I want you, and I'll do anything it takes to get you

I only wanna be with you
I don't make the kind of love that's only for a minute
I'll be inside of you as long as you want me in it

Yeah, well, I only want to be with you

Oh my, I only want to be with you

335,Do Right,"[Verse 1]
Take me back to when
I picked a fight with you
Right out of the blue
I wish we made amends
I didn't mean to lose
All the good times that I had with you

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
If it doesn't mean too much right now
I know that you've probably forgotten
But these things still weigh me down
Take me back to when
I picked a fight with you, ooh

[Chorus]
I miss the way my mama knew what to do
She said to do right by your neighbour
And they'll do right by you
When we get older we can forget the truth
That if you do right by your neighbour
Then they'll do right by you

[Verse 2]
We play this like a game
Why do we pretend
That we were never friends?
When we both haven't changed
Enough to just forget
The windows we broke with another
The secrets we spoke

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
If it doesn't mean too much right now
I know that you've probably forgotten
But these things still weigh me down

336,It's Hard To Be Humble,"[Spoken Intro]
Back a few months ago, I was headlinin' a great big nightclub
And they put me up a couple days early, I came in a couple days early
And they put me up in what they call the ""Star Suite""
Now here I am, headlinin' in one of the biggest nightclubs
In the country and I wake up at eight o'clock in the morning
In this ""Star Suite"" all by myself

Crowd: Awwww

Mac: Yeah, that's what I said, ""Awwwww.""
But I did what I've always done, man, to cheer myself up
I picked up my guitar, I sat down and I wrote me a little song
Now this is how it feels to be alone at the top of the hill
Tryin' to figure out why

[Chorus]
Oh Lord, it's hard to be humble
When you're perfect in every way
I can't wait to look in the mirror
'Cause I get better lookin' each day
To know me is to love me
I must be a hell of a man
Oh Lord, it's hard to be humble
But I'm doin' the best that I can!

[Verse 1]
I used to have a girlfriend
But I guess she just couldn't compete
With all of these love-starved women
Who keep clamoring at my feet
Well I probably could find me another
But I guess they're all in awe of me
Who cares? I never get lonesome
'Cause I treasure my own company

[Chorus]
Ohh
Lord, it's hard to be humble
When you're perfect in every way
(Can't wait to look in the mirror)
I can't wait to look in the mirror
(Help me out now, come on)
I get better lookin' each day
(To know me is to what?)
To know me is to love me
(Must be a hell of a man)
I must be a hell of a man
(Oh Lord, it's hard)
Oh Lord, it's hard to be humble
(When you doin' what?)
We're doin' the best that we can

[Verse 2]
I guess you could say I'm a loner
A cowboy outlaw, tough and proud
Well, I could have lotsa friends if I wanted
But then I wouldn't stand out from the crowd
Some folks say that I'm ""egotistical""
Hell, I don't even know what that means!
I guess it has something to do with the way
That I fill out my skin-tight blue jeans

[Chorus]
Ohh
(Come on, where's all the kickers in here?!)
Oh Lord, it's hard to be humble
(When you're perfect in every way)
When you're perfect in every way
(Can't wait to look in the mirror)
I can't wait to look in the mirror
(Cause I get better lookin')
I get better lookin' each day
(To know me is to what?)
To know me is to love me
(Must be a hell of a man)
I must be a hell of a man
(Oh Lord, it's hard)
Oh Lord, it's hard to be humble
(What are we doin'?)
We're doin' the best that we can
(One more time, what are we doin'?)
We're doing the best that we can!

Through years in the dark? Aah!

Every time I try to walk away
Something makes me turn around and stay

You know sometimes, I don't know why
But this old town just seems so hopeless
I ain't really sure, but it seems I remember the good times
Were just a little bit more in focus
But when she puts her arms around me
I can somehow rise above it
Yeah, man, when I got that little girl standin' right by my side
You know, I can tell the whole wide world to shove it, hey!

Here comes my girl
Here comes my girl
Yeah, and she looks so right
She is all I need tonight

[Verse 2]
Every now and then I get down to the end of the day
I have to stop and ask myself why I've done it
It just seems so useless to have to work so hard
And nothin' ever really seems to come from it
And then she looks me in the eye and says, ""We're gonna last forever""
And man, you know I can't begin to doubt it
No, 'cause it just feels so good, and so free, and so right
I know we ain't never gonna change our minds about it, hey!

Here comes my girl
Here comes my girl
Yeah, and she looks so right
She is all I need tonight

Watch her walk

Every time it seems like there ain't nothin' left no more
I find myself having to reach out and grab hold of something
Yeah, I just catch myself wondering, waiting, and worrying
About some silly little things that don't add up to nothin'
And then she looks me in the eye and says, ""We're gonna last forever""
And man, you know I can't begin to doubt it
No, 'cause it just feels so good, and so free, and so right

342,Off The Wall,"[Intro: Nyck Caution]
Everything I spit direct so y'all really feel it
Finally got up off the wall, it's time to really kill it
Always keep your shit in check, you never know the time
That you finally pay the debt, that you owe your life
So until my last breath, I'll be on my shit
Do my best to make these dreams finally exist
But if I don't become the man I said I'm gonna be
Remember me for who I was, and not for who I couldn't be

[Hook: Kirk Knight]
Off the wall, going in
I'm destined to blow boy, we gon' win
Off the wall, going in
I'm destined to blow boy, we gon' win

I said I'm off the wall, I feel the flow within
I'm on my God of War, Kratos how I'm going in
Rock the cradle y'all been sleepin' on the kid
Rip the bib from 'round my neck and wrap a chain around it
It's Nyck Caution, spell it with a ""Y"" when you write it
Small white kid with the bars, he's a Titan
All right, I'll be up all night
This ain't nothin' new to me, this is what I call life
Off the wall, took my first step, wasn't very scared
And if I can make it here I can make it anywhere
It's my year every year, I don't make no resolutions
I just seek revenge, everyday is my retribution
I be on the record ruthless, when it rains it pours
I'm tryna weather through it, hurricane and storms
Hope my umbrella soothes it, either way I gotta grind it out
Livin' through the lows, time we started climbin' out

Off the wall, off the shizz
Paranoia ain't my only problem kid
Sell it to a mother in her stomach is a kid learning
That where I'm from that's just some regular shit
So, 'til then it's get it how you live
God forbid can't bring home the bacon 'cause I die from one of these pigs
Life's a gamble, take a risk
I'm callin' shots that don't miss, ya bitch we ballin'
Just to get the point across that we can't be stallin', money callin'
Livin' conditions revoking my primal instincts
Gotta get it even if somethin' ends up missin'
Prayin' to the Lord circumstances that a nigga given like
Way easy to sell drugs, fuck hoes forget love
Sip mud 'til I'm bed tucked, quit fightin' get your bands up
Keep Glock on extendo, no games it's Nintendo
You earn stripes 'til the bands show
Like a old head, I been grown
Off the wall, my energy through the roof

Turn up the gain, I got nothin' to lose

We were just too young to know
We fell in love and let it go
So easy to say the words goodbye
So hard to let the feelings die
I know how much I need you now
The time is turning back somehow
As soon as our heart and souls unite
I know for sure we'll get the feeling right

345,Hold On To My Love,"Seventeen, I'd left behind my
Pleated plaids and navy knee socks
Stumbled onto campus in my platform shoes
Feeling young and unafraid
I moved from a passing grade to
Passing bottles in brown wrappers
Passing out in strangers rooms
It was a crazy time;
The world was unraveling
And I would cling to any line
To anyone, to anything
If I could just find my way
To feel familiar tapestry
To hold a thread of sanity
And someone said to me:
Hold on to my love
My love, my love
Hold on to my love
Now I can see it your eyes;
They look at mine defiantly
Seventeen-- no surprise
God, you look so much like me!
The style Ive seen before
The hair, the clothesits all been worn
Honey, it's the uniform
Of non-conformity
And history has her patterns
I remember seventeen-
Between the past and the future
Youre caught somewhere in the seam

And if your dreams no longer fit you
If the ones you once held dear
Start to fade and disappear
Remember- hope is here

Hold on to my love
I don't profess to know the future
Couldn't guess beyond today
This thread of hope is all I offer
If the fabrics torn away
Disillusioned, disconnected
Sometimes it's hard to see
There is method to this madness
Pattern to this tapestry
When people talk of cutting things
Cutting corners, cutting lines
Ties and losses, apron strings
Connections to another time
There's something here for you to hold
As long as you're a child of mine

Now I gotta ball, flex on Adderall
Sex on Tramadol, I guess I'll try 'em all

Most of the artists wished for an early death
I will give it my all, yes, I will give it my best

""Admit if, you bit it, bit it""

You can be a ridah and ride, or a coward and hide
Either way you go against me, you still gon die
I got four macs, a few nines, I'm ready for beef
You wanna talk, it ain't about money, then let it be brief
I need a drop for when it's a hot, a Hummer for when it's cold
An ill attorney's in my corner when these fake niggas fold
The shit I kick fuck with niggas mentally, makes them wanna mention me
And see me doing a quarter century in the penitentiary
Nastradamus predicted 50's the future, that's a fact money
I run up on your workers with the mac, like where that pack money
I'm a tell ya'll what Papi told me
I got what you need, 19,5 a key
I stay catching a stunt, frontin' in somethin' mean
And I'll clap any nigga for the right amount of cream
Run up on them all with the same problem solver
Beat up ass, tape on the handle, trey eight revolver. What!

Projects too hot, niggas better hope we never hit rock
Cause then we gonna run up in your spot
Screamin' get the fuck on the floor, give us the raw
(Repeat)

[Verse 2 - Nature]
Aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo
I'm like Sugar Shane Mosley, it ain't no beef
You're staring, a ticket holder that sits in row three
Next to Ron Artest and Kobe
Yo I woulda went pro too, then I let them phillies slow me
I'm like a black man's asthma, seeking a pump
Breathin' deeper when I'm creeping up
Ya'll need to fuck with the tightest, I stick niggas
Encephalitis leavin' whole families in silence
My virus is obvious, past on to most rap fiends
Un cured, ain't no vaccine
Last seen at the automatic teller machine, maxing out
Or in the studio booth, blacking out
It's Con Air style, real twisted, I disappear on some Blair Witch shit
Comin' back I'm rich kid
Either or, you can't stop me with my feet in the door
Or walk away from the street or the morgue, play your part nigga

Tatted on they arms, pimp your moms, like I'm Magic Don Juan

We smoke that, leave our minks on the coat rack
Those that plot on me, nine times outta ten the nine is on me
Feds search the God, but nothin' they find on me
When I rap don't wait to clap applaud sooner
Unless you hate a nigga like George Bush Jr., I bring war quick to you
Porsche maneuvers through the city like New York sewers
Stinkin' up the air, Central Park, horse manure

22 inch dick when I'm pimpin'

Once I thought I knew you
But you let me forget the past

But if it's just for the night, I wanted to know
Need the truth, when have I needed it more

Oh, no, you took it by storm

Fightin' for my freedom of speech, but then they censor it
Killin' any microphone in sight just for the heck of it

See the beats still going on, Webby rock it so terrific
With a flow that be colder than the Nagano Olympics
Made a little dough, put some lobster on my dishes
Picking up the flow and then I drop it on you bitches
Motherfucking guillotine, you won't have your head attached
When I step up on the stage and people sayin' ""Webbys back!""
Can't stand the whack shit so I'll wreck a track
And spend my Friday murdering Rebecca Black
And I still be the one you fuckers feel
And I won't stop 'til I got myself a couple mil'
In the building, and I'll show you how it's done for real

And sails can fill with doubt
Where's your vision
If the embers flicker out?

Your river is fading

Will rise with the dawn

What have I done?
Comes a moment when it's clear
There's only one

I've made up my mind
I give you more than you've asked for

There are those who can foresee
Where we will go
All the future
I don't really want to know
Only that you'll be here with me

While the embers still glow
We'll be safe till tomorrow

Keep the fire burning tonight
See just what comes into sight
Don't take forever
Take it through the night
And believe the sun
Will rise with the dawn
That's all you need to go on
For tonight

Solitaire, solitaire, neck, ear, solitaire
Bad bitch from Fort Lauderdale, said she love them solitaires

Four mil for the crib, one point five just to keep me chill (One point five)

365,Somewhere In America,"Here in America, in every single state, they have a set of standards for every subject
A collection of lessons that the teacher's required to teach by the end of the term
But the greatest lessons you'll ever teach us will not come from your syllabus
The greatest lessons you will ever teach us, you will not even remember

You never told us what we weren't allowed to say
We just learned how to hold our tongues
Now somewhere in America, there is s a child holding a copy of ""Catcher in the Rye"" and there is a child holding a gun
But only one of these things have been banned by their state government
And it's not the one that can rip through flesh
It's the one that says ""fuck you"" on more pages than one

Because we must control what the people say, and how they think
And if they want to become the overseer of their own selves, then we'll show them a real one
And somewhere in America, there's a child sitting at his mother's computer, reading the homepage of the KKK's website, and that's open to the public
But that child will never have read ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" because the school has banned it for it's use of the ""N"" word

Maya Angelou is prohibited because we're not allowed to talk about rape in school
We were taught that 'just because something happens, doesn't mean you are to talk about it'
They built us brand new shopping malls so that we'll forget where we're really standing
On the bones of the Hispanics, on the bones of the slaves, on the bones of the Native Americans, on the bones of those who fought  just to speak!

Transcontinental Railroad to Japanese Internment Camps
There are things missing from our history books
But we were taught that it is better to be silent, than to make them uncomfortable
Somewhere in America, private school girls search for hours through boutiques, trying to find the prom dress of their dreams
While kids on the south side spending hours searching through the 'lost and found' 'cause winter's coming soon and that's the only jacket they have

Kids are late to class for working the midnight shift
They give awards for best attendance, but not for keeping your family off the streets
These kids will call your music ghetto, they will tell you you don’t talk right
Then they’ll get in the backseat of a car with all their friends singing ‘ bout how “They’re ‘bout that life” and “we can’t stop”
Somewhere in America, schools are promoting self confidence
While they whip out their scales and shout out your body fat percentage in class

While heftier girls are hiding away, and the slim fit beauties can’t help but giggle with pride
The preppy kids go thrift shopping ‘cause they think it sounds real fun
But we go ‘cause that’s all we got money for
‘Cause momma works for the city, momma only gets paid once a month
Somewhere in America, a girl is getting felt up by a grown man on the subway
She’s still in her school uniform and that’s part of the appeal
It’s hard to run in knee socks and Mary Jane’s, and all her male teachers know it too

Coaches cover up the star players raping freshmen after the dance
Women are killed for rejecting dates, but God forbid I bring my girlfriend to prom
Girls black out drunk at the after party, take a picture before her wounds wake her
How many pixels is your sanity worth? What’s a 4.0 to a cold jury?
What’d you learn in class today?
Don’t walk fast, don’t speak loud, keep your hands to yourself, keep your head down
Keep your eyes on your own paper, if you don’t know the answer, fill in “C”
Always wear earbuds when you ride the bus alone
If you feel like someone’s following you, pretend you’re on the phone

A teacher never fails, only you do

Every state in America, the greatest lessons, are the ones you don’t remember learning",Get Lit,1980,"[70, 70, 71, 74, 75, 77, 79, 81, 85, 87, 91, 95]",12

You defy description
And I've seen a vision of you
In a vision of my dreams

I wanna say it loud and clear
Loud and clear

I feel like I just woke up
And now the fog is gone

You are the one who would break my heart

'Cause I was looking for someone to love

You led me on pretendin' you could care

Promisin' the love we'd share together
I've closed the door, I can't take it anymore

Hit it, no rubber never would let no one touch her
Swear we drive each other, man, she be so stubborn
But, what the fuck is love with no pain, no suffer?
Intense, this shit, it gets dense

Ever go down or get caught, or they identify
My bitch was the most solid, nothing to solidify
She would never cheat, you'd never see her with a different guy
Ever tell you different, then it's a lie
See, that's my down bitch, see that's my soldier
She keeps that thang-thang if anyone goes there
Calm and collected, she keeps her composure
And she gon' ride for me until this thing over
We do drugs together (Together), fuck up clubs together (Together)
And we'd both go crazy (Crazy) if we was to sever

I always wanted to believe
That we could leave this town forever
But we're still not free
You're the lock and I'm the key
I stir in this late night
Lonely radio broadcasts dreams
Impossible to please
We both tried our best to come clean
Two hearts that never speak
We just agree on a beat worth keeping
I stir in this late night
Lonely radio broadcasts dreams
We don't believe our living hearts
Could freeze but still look at books
With a flashlight
Picturing the words and sounds
Corinthians
Galatians
We made a sad surprise
Demons and lakes and mountains and orchards
Are pressed like flowers between the pages

390,Years,"[Chorus 1]
Once I was seven years old my momma told me
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old

[Verse 1]
It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

[Chorus 2]
Once I was 11 years old my daddy told me
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was 11 years old

[Verse 2]
I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

[Chorus 3]
Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once I was 20 years old

(Lukas Graham!!!)

[Verse 3]
I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

[Chorus 4]
Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
I was writing 'bout everything, I saw before me
Once I was 20 years old
Soon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon we'll be 30 years old

[Verse 4]
I'm still learning about life
My woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs
And I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me
Some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind
My brother I'm still sorry

[Bridge]
Soon I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month

[Chorus 5]
Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
Soon I'll be 60 years old
Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me
Soon I'll be 60 years old

We get no justice so it ain't peaceful, yeah
They can bluff you, they can beat you
Paid attorney, we gon' need it
Momma told me there was demons
And she ain't never lied on her Jesus'
She worked her ass off just to feed us
She went to Ross to cop the new Adidas
She used to tap in with all the teachers
They wasn't teachin' nothin', it's no secret
Whole lotta crime, lil' niggas beefin'
We gotta keep it or end up a victim
Trapped in the system, traffickin' drugs
Modern-day slavery, African thugs
We go to war for this African blood
We go to war for this African blood
When I put niggas on, it was all out of love
You was disloyal, can't call it no love

We stove whippin', niggas know we gon' get it

Fuck around and get locked, you ain't never comin' home with it
Look, my nigga, I came from the sewer
Don't shit on my past, you ain't come from manure
You see Reason and you see LA
But bitch I ain't come for no ruin
Just know all of my niggas, we struggled for it
Had to hustle for it, cried puddles for it
My pops watched his sister get locked for it
I done seen my niggas get knocked for it like {gunshot}
Gimme that, I carry Del Amo like a piggyback
I carry my city like guilt that ain't got no forgiveness
No way out, shit we locked in the system
Catch a case and they not gon' forgive ya
White skin, you be out before Christmas
Shit, auntie missed eight of those days
Tears from me, had to pray those days
Had to slave those days
Shit, we had to hit up a couple hood giveaways those days
Thank God for every inch that he gave us
Thank God for everything cause he made us
Like when that car bent the block, blat blat
Hit the homie but we made it to ER and he saved us
Thinkin' that he could've died, nigga
We was prayin' to the sky and his momma cried rivers
Healed up, but tough luck, he tried to get revenge
Had to drop, bullets popped and they killed him
Worst part is that it sound so familiar

393,Say Goodbye To Little Jo,"Just say goodbye to Little Jo…
Just turn her loose now let her go…
And she’ll be leaving while the sun goes down
She doesn’t love ya anymore

Sometimes it’s worth it to talk
Some wounds are easy to heal
Sometimes it’s all in your mind
But this time it’s big and it’s real

Gold turning back into night
This time you can’t make her stay
Don’t try to block her in pain
Or don’t try to stand in her way

Just say goodbye to Little Jo…
Just turn her loose now let her go…
And she’ll be leaving while the sun goes down
She doesn’t love ya anymore

She tried to take ya somewhere
Somewhere you needed to be
Ya howl and ya curse at the gate
Till she tried to give you the key

You got no right to her love
You with your bloody hot brain
Aw, don’t try to suck her back in
No one could make her remain

Just say goodbye to Little Jo…
Just turn her loose now let her go…
She’ll be leaving ya while the sun goes down
She doesn’t love you anymore

Say goodbye she’s gonna let it all unwind
Say goodbye she’ll la-la-leave it all behind
She’s meant to be gone let her leave without fighting
Rollin’ away down the line

You’ve shown so much of your hate
She’s seen so much of your greed
She’s taken shit for so long, yes, yes
That you ain’t got nothin’ she needs

You don’t deserve her no how
Go fading back into fate
Go sit ya down where ya were…
Don’t grab and beg it’s too late

Just say goodbye to Little Jo…
Just turn her loose man; let her go…
She’ll be leaving while the sun goes down
She doesn’t love you anymore
She doesn’t love ya anymore
She doesn’t love ya anymore
She doesn’t love you anymore",Steve Forbert,1980,"[97, 85, 89]",3
394,Don't Cry For Me Argentina,"It won't be easy
You'll think it's strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love
After all that I've done
You won't believe me
All you will see
Is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you

I had to let it happen
I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window
Staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

And as for fortune and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world
They were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions
They promise to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

Don't cry for me Argentina

Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

Have I said too much?
There's nothing more I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do
Is look at me to know
That every word is true",Julie Covington,1980,"[99, 88, 92, 92, 72, 73, 83, 90]",8

[Hook: T-Pain (Fabolous) {unlisted J.D. ad libs}]

[Fabolous]
Through the time I been alone, time I spent on phones
Know you ain't lettin them climb up in my throne
Now, baby that lime with that Patron
Have me talkin crazy, it's time to come on home
Now, I talk with someone above
It's okay to lose your pride over someone you love
Don't lose someone you love though over your pride
Stick wit'cha entree and get over your side
We break up to make up at Jacob's baby
Her parents fought too, I'm the makeup baby
Wake up baby, love'll have you open though
I mean you seen Tom Cruise on the Oprah show
So I just can't bet on the next hand
There's too much in this pot just to give to the next man

[Hook]

[Fabolous]
Now if you ain't never went through it you ain't really into it
The next rap to show you I really been through it
Every other day I'm givin the love away
That's what your friend's sister or little brother say
If I'mma do somethin, it's the undercover way
When them hatin ass watchdogs look the other way
And others may not see that we need each other
But if we on the same page we can read each other
They should learn us, instead of try to turn us
Mr. and Ms. Smith, we both got the burners - UP~!
If you love your baby then turn this up
Know we keep this hot like a Thermos cup
Relax, don't be tryin to perm us up
We already straight - yesss

Coming down like an Armageddon flame (Hey!)
The shame, the ones who died without a name
Hear the dogs howling out of key

And bleed, the company lost the war today

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday

Hear the drum pounding out of time
Another protester has crossed the line (Hey!)
To find the money's on the other side
Can I get another Amen? (Amen!)
There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (Hey!)
A gag, a plastic bag on a monument

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday

Sieg Heil to the president Gasman

Just ‘cause, just ‘cause
Because we're outlaws, yeah!

I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

[Куплет 1: T-Fest]
Не звони мне на трубу, если ты хочешь её бросить
В голосе зима, но в глубине тянет на осень
Не знаешь меня, ты не знаешь меня
Перестань кричать, перестань создавать головняк
О, да, вибрацией на пол
Экраном прямо вниз, меня бесит телефон
Аромат в истерике духов
Засыпаю под Kick, просыпаюсь под Tom
Спокойствие не купишь
Улыбка лишь на время, наши деньги лишь на участь
Время нас позвало, но не ты
Время нас и заберёт, остановив наши котлы

[Предприпев: T-Fest]
Налей (мне), если ты хочешь скандала
Нет, нету никого хуже, чем я
Ты сама мне так сказала
Я здесь, если ты хочешь скандала
Покажи весь свой огонь, весь свой огонь
Пусть всё растает
Давай устроим скандал
Давай устроим скандал

[Припев: T-Fest]
Ведь это просто наши нервы — скандал
Мы больше не вернём это назад
Я знаю, зачем ты сейчас пришла
Давай устроим скандал
Ведь это просто наши нервы — скандал
Мы больше не вернем это назад
Я знаю, зачем ты сейчас пришла
Давай устроим скандал

[Куплет 2: Баста]
Снова мир переверни
Я устал от этих игр
Сплетен и интриг
Этот трип, снимай хоть триллер
Ты безукоризненная, словно призрак
Преступная харизма
Я пропадаю на районе от твоих капризов
Я приставлю ствол к твоему сердцу, ты услышишь выстрел
Я припрячу для тебя свой самый грязный панч
Всем панчам панч, такими не банчат
Я запиваю свою боль горькой печалью
На твоём теле слишком много моих отпечатков
Ещё один ебучий квест
Любовь и ненависть во мне — гремучая смесь
Тебе нужен скандал, я удалю себя
Из твоей жизни словно вирус с компа

[Предприпев: T-Fest]
Налей (мне), если ты хочешь скандала
Нет, нету никого хуже, чем я
Ты сама мне так сказала
Я здесь, если ты хочешь скандала
Покажи весь свой огонь, весь свой огонь
Пусть всё растает

Ведь это просто наши нервы — скандал
Мы больше не вернём это назад

409,My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys,"I grew up dreamin' of bein' a cowboy
Lovin' the cowboy ways
Pursuin' the life of my high-ridin' heroes
I burned up my childhood days
I learned all the rules of the modern-day drifter
Don't you hold on to nothin' too long
Just take what you need from the ladies, then leave them
With the words of a sad country song

My heroes have always been cowboys
And they still are, it seems
Sadly, in search of, but one step in back of
Themselves and their slow-movin' dreams

Cowboys are special with their own brand of misery
From being alone too long
You could die from the cold in the arms of a nightmare
Knowin' well your best days are gone
Pickin' up hookers instead of my pen
I let the words of my years fade away
Old worn-out saddles, an 'old worn-out memories
With no one and no place to stay

My heroes have always been cowboys
And they still are, it seems
Sadly in search of, but one step in back of
Themselves and their slow-movin' dreams",Waylon Jennings,1980,"[95, 53, 44, 44, 48, 53, 59, 66, 76, 87]",10

In a corner of your room

So far from where we used to be

I was down, I was beat, I was cryin'
I was cornered and hurt
I was hidin' my face, sittin' there cryin'

I was so lonely until I met you
Told myself I'd get by without love
Drowning my sorrows, avoiding tomorrows
Kind of felt that I just had enough

And here I am
I'm back on my feet again
Here I am
I'm back on my feet again

Yeah, here I am

420,Romeo's Tune,"[Chorus]
Meet me in the middle of the day
Let me hear you say everything's okay
Bring me southern kisses from your room
Meet me in the middle of the night
Let me hear you say everything's alright
Let me smell the moon in your perfume

[Verse 1]
Oh, gods and years will rise and fall
And there's always something more
Lost in talk, I waste my time
And it's all been said before
While further down behind the masquerade the tears are there
I don't ask for all that much I just want someone to care
That's right now

[Chorus]
Meet me in the middle of the day
Let me hear you say everything's okay
Come on out beneath the shining sun
Meet me in the middle of the night
Let me hear you say everything's alright
Sneak on out beneath the stars and run

[Verse 2]
It's king and queen and we must go down now beyond the chandelier
Where I won't have to speak my mind and you won't have to hear
Shreds of news and afterthoughts and complicated scenes
We'll weather down behind the light and fade like magazines

[Verse 3]
So meet me in the middle of the day
Let me hear you say everything's okay
Bring me southern kisses from your room
Ooh baby
Hey hey, meet me in the middle of the night
Let me hear you say everything's alright
Let me smell the moon in your perfume

Oh yea, meet me in the middle of the day
Let me hear you everything's okay
Let me see you smiling back at me
Oh yea, meet me in the middle of the night
Let me hear you say everything's alright
Hold me tight and love and loving's free

422,Survive,"[Intro]
At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinkin' how you did me wrong
And I grew strong, and I learned how to get along

[Verse 1]
And so you're back, from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me

[Pre-Chorus]
Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

[Chorus]
Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, hey hey

[Verse 2]
It took all the strength I had, not to fall apart
Just tryin' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high

And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like droppin' in and just expect me to be free
Well now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore

424,Where Does The Lovin' Go,"Tell me where does the lovin’ go when it’s gone away
Tell me when does the heartache end, or is it bound to stay
I always thought that we would last forever;
A love that never ever would be ending
Now I see it isn’t meant to be and I’ve got to stop pretending

Tell me where are all the things that we used to share
Are they lost to some other time? Will they still be there?
I can’t believe that my place could be taken
A heart so easy breakin’ up inside
‘Cause after all this time I’ve thought of you as mine
And it’s hard to let go, my heart says no

I never knew we were losing touch
I didn’t think we could change so much
Don’t take your leave of me just yet;
Smile for me once more, so I won’t forget

Tell me where is another chance like the one we knew?
Tell me where can I find someone, someone just like you?
Can’t imagine what I’m gonna do
‘cause I’ve lived my life for you and all we’ve planned
And I don’t think I’ll ever understand where does the lovin’ go",David  Gates,1980,"[67, 46, 46, 51, 58, 64, 74, 85]",8

436,Love On The Phone,"Miles and miles away from you
You know I'd fly there if you told me to
We speak on the phone but where is your body
Help me Help me

It's so hard when I'm feeling on fire
And all I can hold is the telephone wire
It's so hard being almost alone
And lying here in the dark

Makin' love on the phone
Love on the phone
Makin' love on the phone
Love on the phone

I call your number and it's rings once or twice
You answer softly and your voice sounds so nice
You whisper sweet things and you tell me what to do
And I respond and make love to you

I know you want me I know you care
I'm over here You're over there
You know I want you cause you're the best
Hang on a minute I'll get undressed
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes No!

It's so hard when I'm feeling on fire
And all I can hold is the telephone wire
It's so hard being almost alone
And lying here in the dark

Makin' love on the phone
Love on the phone
Makin' love on the phone
Love on the phone

Long distance loving it's not ideal
But just the same we like how it feels
I am a woman and you are my man
I guess we're doing the best we can

Makin' love on the phone
Love on the phone
Love on the phone

437,I Wish I Was Eighteen Again,"At a bar down in Dallas
An old man chimed in
And they thought he was out of his head
And all being young men
They just laughed it off
When they heard what this old man said
He said I'll never again
Turn the young ladies' heads
Or go running off into the wind
I'm three quarters home
From the start to the end
And I wish I was eighteen again
Oh I wish I was eighteen again
And going where I've never been
Now old folks and old oaks
Standing tall, just pretend
I wish I was eighteen again
Time turns the pages
And life goes so fast
The years turn the dark hair all grey
I talk to some young folks
But they don't understand
The words this old man's got to say
Oh I wish I was eighteen again
And going where I've never been
Now old folks and old oaks
Standing tall, just pretend
I wish I was eightee-een again
Oh I wish I was eighteen again...",Ray Price,1980,"[91, 91, 49, 49, 53, 55, 65, 76, 81, 83]",10
438,When A Man Loves A Woman,"When a man loves a woman
Can't keep his mind on nothin' else
He'd change the world for the good thing he's found
If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend if he put her down

When a man loves a woman
He'll spend his very last dime
Tryin' to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts
And sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way
It ought to be

Well, this man loves you, woman
I gave you everything I had
Tryin' to hold on to your heartless love
Baby, please don't treat me bad

When a man loves a woman
Down deep in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she is playin' him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Lovin' eyes can never see

When a man loves a woman
He can do her no wrong
He can never want
Some other girl

Yes when a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels
Cause baby, baby, you're my world

Her bra and panties with her jacket, that's her outfit
Her heels fly, they real high

She love to say she wanna take her top off
My car’s orange, her toes too
R. Kelly on, bumpin' that old school

Her legs wide open, can they see her while she's layin' in her

I know she wanna play, it’s written all on her face

440,Coward Of The County,"[Verse 1]
Everyone considered him
The coward of the county
He'd never stood one single time
To prove the county wrong
His mama named him Tommy
But folks just called him yellow
Something always told me
They were reading Tommy wrong

[Verse 2]
He was only ten years old
When his daddy died in prison
I looked after Tommy
Cause he was my brother's son
I still recall the final words
My brother said to Tommy
Son my life is over, but yours has just begun

[Chorus]
Promise me, son
Not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
Now it don't mean you're weak
If you turn the other cheek
And I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man

[Verse 3]
There's someone for everyone
And Tommy's love was Becky
In her arms he didn't have
To prove he was a man
One day while he was working
The Gatlin boys came calling
They took turns at Becky
N'there was three of them
Tommy opened up the door
And saw his Becky crying
The torn dress, the shattered look
Was more than he could stand
He reached above the fireplace
Took down his daddy's picture
As a tear fell on his daddy's face
He heard these words again

[Chorus]
Promise me, son
Not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
Now it don't mean you're weak
If you turn the other cheek
And I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man

[Verse 4]
The Gatlin boys just laughed at him
When he walked into the barroom
One of them got up
And met him half way cross the floor
Tommy turned around they said
""Hey look, old yella's leavin'""
But you could've heard a pin drop
When Tommy stopped and locked the door
Twenty years of crawling
Was bottled up inside him
He wasn't holding nothing back
He let 'em have it all
Tommy left the bar room
Not a Gatlin boy was standing
He said, ""This one's for Becky""
As he watched the last one fall
N' I heard him say

[Chorus 2]
I promised you, Dad
Not to do the things you've done
I walk away from trouble when I can
Now please don't think I'm weak
I didn't turn the other cheek
Papa, I sure hope you understand
Sometimes you gotta fight
When you're a man

441,This Is It,"[Hook: Erick Arc Elliott]
All you fools just sound the same
Ain’t no credit to your name
Ain’t no credit line open, that’s discrediting the fame
Form your business in the name, something unique like a slang
Make a difference, make a change
But ain’t no puppets on a string
Don’t be chilling on the couch, remember this is for the clout
Remember this is for the poor niggas that’ll represent you when you’re out
Forget you when you need your friends, fuck it we just meet again (why)
All my niggas need a plan, cos all my niggas need to win

[Verse 1: Zombie Juice]
Always was a winner even when I wasn’t 'posed to
The money getting bigger as if it wasn’t supposed to
Just a lonely nigga, talk too much to myself, need a break
On July 8th broke down heaven’s gates
Now I stay high all day
Fuck you leaving, fuck all evening
Call me mister fuck all day
Trap all day and night
Don’t need a house much less you ‘bout some change
Expand my conscious, tryna’ walk on water
Feel the earth on me
You hatin’, I’ll be somewhere slayin’ bitches by their face on me
Catch a fade, Kobe, with an eighth on me
Not phased, don’t pass that shit homie
Cough, smoke, cough, got my shit sealed off
‘Bout to put some in the air, ‘til a nigga doze off
Cos you got some shrooms, I got a room
You and me ‘til we reach the moon
Never wore a disguise, love the skin I’m in
You trade your soul for fame, we ain’t built the same

[Hook: Erick Arc Elliott]

Forget you when you need your friends, fuck it we just meet again (why)
All my niggas need a plan, cos all my niggas need to win

[Verse 2: Erick Arc Elliott]
All I ever wanted was to be a one to one
Now I’m one in three
Compulsively a nigga gotta run up or get none
Know I feel your pain, a different day
Opinions always alter when you’re done
Pray to put you down, afraid to look around, instead I pen it for my dogs (Hoo!)
Know my city give me 150 for my steez, 150 for my beats
Three niggas, we gotta eat
Shouts to fans that’s overseas, hey
Independent grind, at least we did form a company
We a bond that never breaks, never giving up the cake
Not a fan of pointing fingers at men
It’s dependent on who can pay for academics
Homie your chemists are missing appendages
You back into handling business, no kidding
My head’s at the clinic, I need a prescription
My vision is clearer through smoke and them mirrors
I can’t be compared to those niggas you hearing
So don’t be offended when niggas don’t feel you

[Hook: Erick Arc Elliott]
All you fools just sound the same

[Verse 3: Meechy Darko]
Feeling brave? Nigga run up
Buck shots, tear your muscle
And I don’t need Joey to pump it
Pitbull, no muzzle
Badmon, I’m thuggin’
Done know, gun smoke
Can’t tell me nothin’, there’s no need for discussion
I’m the sinner in Saint, I'm the box logo bully
Used to buy Bathing Ape, now they send this shit to me
I paved the way for niggas that're scared to say what they ain't wanna say
Now watch a demon demonstrate, annihilate
Love / hate it's all the same
Will I die from my homicide
Or will I die from taking too much drugs?
Lord knows I deserve to die on an acid high and I’m double cupped
Coke line, hundred blunts
Seen a few bitches I’d love to fuck
2Pac in 96 and troublesome
27 club, here I come
Comma, c-c-c-c comma, comma, comma
A whole lot of decimals
I just s-see my account and c-c-c-c-c-c-c count all my blessings up
Bloodstream full of chemical
Crip, Blood, twist your fingers up
Better than some of them veterans
Bet they gon’ say it’s beginners luck
I would die for my niggas, but would they do the same?
Hennessey by the gallon, I'm losing my balance and manage the pain
I would ride for my niggas, just show me the lane
My grandaddy's still in the kitchen, w-w-whipping the ‘caine
My celly’ keep ringing
I cannot find enough coverage to answer
The backwoods is hitting
Hope that that shit is not giving me cancer
Trip on acid while I'm rapping, Sippin' muddy, counting money
I think she took too many xannies, she fell asleep while she was sucking

[Outro: Meechy Darko]
Made it out the gutter, shout out to my mother
Kudos to my papa, he ain’t wear the rubber
This is it, I do this shit here for my brothers
This is it, I do this shit here for my brothers
This is it, I do this shit here for my brothers...

Feeling the softness of a warm summer rain
I see the reflections of my mind
All the sadness all the pain
Visions of yesterday
How fast they slip away
And though my dreams have come and gone

Kiss me in the rain
And make me feel like a child again
Bring back all those memories
Kiss me in the rain
And make me feel like a child again
With the feeling that I get
I don't even mind if we get wet

And if I drift outside myself
Please don't turn away
I'm searching for the innocence
I've lost along the way
Come join me in my fantasy
Step out of space and time
There's only one thing left to do
So if you wouldn't mind

Kiss me in the rain
And make me feel like a child again
Bring back all those memories
Kiss me in the rain
And make me feel like a child again
With the feeling that I get
I don't even mind if I get wet

Kiss me in the rain

Bring back all those memories
Kiss me in the rain
And make me feel like a child again

Took a wrong turn, and we
Fell down a rabbit hole
You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems
And spinning out of control

Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?
Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?

I should have slept with one eye open at night

Too in love to think straight
All alone, or so it seemed
But there was strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams, oh

Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?

Said a woman had hurt his pride
Told him that she loved him so, and
Turned around and let him go

Or you're gonna get hurt yourself
Someone's gonna tell you lies
Cut you down to size""

Don't do me like that
Don't do me like that

Don't do me like that

Listen, honey, can you see?

Giving someone else a try
And you know you better watch your step
Or you're gonna get hurt yourself
Someone's gonna tell you lies
Cut you down to size

Clouds the light of the love that I found

449,Ladies Night,"[Verse 1]
We can take this
Once more down the line
It's human to feel loneliness from time to time
I wish I could explain the way you catch the light
Instead Its ""will you stay the night""

But first can I just say
That beauty rarely moves me to behave this way
Try to kiss you on the way back home then ask you
Won’t you stay

[Chorus]
I know there aren't too many good girls left these days
Doesn't mean I'm giving up
It just means I know the stakes
But darling when you smile at me
All I want to do is stay
I suppose it's ladies night
You can go ahead

[Verse 2]
Distance warps the game
God knows if in two months we'll both still feel the same
I hope you trust me when I say it's not a play
There's just no way I can stay

But if we take our time
I think there’s space to carve out of this traveler's life
If you are down to take this night by night
I'm down as hell to have a try

[Chorus]
I know there aren't too many good girls left these days
Doesn't mean I'm giving up
It just means I know the stakes
But darling when you smile at me
All I want to do is stay
I suppose it's ladies night
You can go ahead
And have your way

[Verse 1]
Sometimes you worry 'bout the things he can provide for ya
Whenever you around I seem to come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party, soft lips, soft spoken
I came and talked to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right
If I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

But who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out your zone?
Now be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it

463,Send One Your Love,"[Chorus 1]
Send her your love
With a dozen roses
Make sure that she knows it
With a flower from your heart

[Chorus 2]
Show him your love
Don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason
When it's straight from the heart

[Verse 1]
I've heard so many say that the days of romance are no more
And people falling in love is so old fashioned
But waiting are they the day they once let slip away
Hiding need to fulfill their heart's desire for love’s passion

[Chorus 1]
Send her your love
With a dozen roses
Make sure that she knows it
With a flower from your heart

[Chorus 2]
Show him your love
Don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason
When it's straight from the heart

[Verse 2]
I know that people say two hearts beating as one is unreal
And can only happen in make believe stories
But so blind they all must be that they cannot believe what they see
For around us are miracles of love’s glory

[Chorus 2]
Show him your love
Don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason
When it's straight from the heart",Stevie Wonder,1980,"[95, 93, 62, 38, 14, 6, 5, 4, 4]",9

Just be glad you got 'em

And the stars in the sky don't mean nothing to you; they're a mirror

Fall in love, no, I'm never gonna fall in love
I mean it, I mean it

Can't break what's left of my heart
Once bitten twice shy
I hate to see it all fall apart
First love I had I was seventeen and I was younger
Love to us was some kind of game
And all my letters said I would never forget her
Now I can't recall her name
The first time I was a fool
Never knew that love could be so cruel
It happened again
Third time lucky
Oh Yeah
I was in love one time
I thought it was the real thing
But I kept the feelings to myself
Afraid to show them
Expecting her to know
It's the reason she found someone else
It's all behind me
There's good luck up ahead
Can't break what's left of my heart
Once bitten twice shy
I hate to see it all fall apart
The first time I was a fool
Never knew that love could be so cruel
It happened again
Third time lucky

I, I, I, you in my way, bitch it's no sympathy
I, I, I, been plotting this since elementary
I, I, I, no you need to buckle down
Have people asking where you at
And wondering why you never wanna come around
You know that effort gon' come around
Big face like Zordon
You bought the watch but can't afford the time
Even if you running out of breath
Weight of the world doing lots of reps
Time to get this generation
Last one and then the next two outta debt
And they gon' pay you back with respect
Just stick to the plan, still, we can chill
Back when I rocked the white and blue Grant Hills
I realized there's no dream that I can't fill
I manifested all while I'm the man still
(Bitch I'm the man)

[Verse 3]
Voices in my head attacking what I'm thinking
Bullet to the head might be the way to free it
If I leave my body I can free the spirits
Swear to God my death of fear just keep on shrinking
Wishing I could go back to the nineties
Back when I was dreaming
Me and my dog was on a mission like we Kel and Kenan
Early 2000s Detroit might as well been the hell with demons
Wondering when I started losing it, the losing grip
Feeling like I'm in the middle of the ocean
You either drown or canoe through it
Voices in my head said I'm used to it
Some help me to lose and some help me maneuv' through it
When I talk to myself I'm confused on who's who it
I know in life you either blow it or blew it
And at the end of life, it's gonna feel like you flew through it
I just hope by then I cut the voices in my head",Big Sean,1980,"[93, 58, 32, 33, 37, 41, 44]",7

481,Can We Still Be Friends,"[Verse 1]
Well, don't you hate it when you mess up with a friend
From around the bend?
Thinking this could be the end
And you won't know what you got until it's gone
And it's been so long
That no one's right and no one's wrong

[Verse 2]
And have you ever given up in a fight
On a Friday night
Saying, ""Who turned out the light?""
Well, don't you worry cause it happens all the time
Somewhere down the line
You'll be okay and he'll be fine

[Chorus]
And then one night, he arrives to your surprise
Someone let him in and all you can say is
""I know it's not the same but I'm glad you came
Can we still be friends?""

[Verse 3]
And just be careful if forgiveness can be found
The second time around
There's not a thing to bring you down
And don't you listen to your head when you're alone
Just pick up the phone
And hope it ain't the busy tone

482,Lonely Eyes,"You've got me stuck to where I'm sitting
Looking at your eyes
Then I know I'm so pathetic
I wouldn't move to save my life

They tell me that you're lonely
It's no surprise, when you walk around all day
Wearing those lonely, lonely, lonely
Lonely eyes

Well, I try to tell you jokes
I'm afraid you'd cry
And if you need a little sunshine
You can borrow some of mine

""It's okay if you're unhappy""
I would say before I leave her
Just take a look around
There's no one here that's happy either

Lonely girl, you are my world
And I could be anything you need
And if for some reason you don't feel like talking
I could just sit and enjoy your company
Your company

The days keep going by
And it doesn't get much better
It could be threatening to jump
And all of your friends would just scream
(""Let her!"")

They count on you to leave
'Cause it has always been that way
But on the one day they close early
That's the one you want to stay

Lonely girl, you are my world
And I could be anything you need
And if for some reason you don't feel like talking
I'd just sit and enjoy your company
Your company

Lonely girl, you are my world
And I could be anything you need

From slipping through your hands

Is to love and never stop

Got to keep holding on holding on
Holding on for dear love
You better try holding on holding on
Holding on for dear love
You've got to keep holding on holding on
Holding on for dear love
Holding on holding on

How a good love can go bad

Watching enemies close
They be doing the most
So I go through the motions
Five blunts in rotation, five blunts
Five blunts in rotation, five blunts

Five blunts in rotation, five blunts

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Good head is my motivation
Gas her up like a service station
Purple drank on you perpetratin'
While you perpetrating, I'm renegotiatin'
Ah, let me think about it
Ah, it's like a bank around me
When the soldiers with me it's like a tank around me
And I don't like niggas saying ""cain't"" around me
I define the odds, 2 Glock nines is my body guards
Ain't nothing slick to a can of oil
Roll up, I'm high as fuck
Some of you niggas ain't try enough
Some of you niggas ain't buy enough
You smoking good, put your lighters up

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
A nigga like me don't smoke blunts so I keep those joints in rotation
Bad bitches calling the radio, keep my joints in rotation
Keep throwing money on her ass, she keep that joint in rotation
First I'm in a car and then another car, I keep them joints in rotation
And I'm hella faded - getting elevated
She give me them good brains - I'm getting well educated
Soon as them hoes see my car, they wanna jump right in
If you see my crib, you would think I was Malibu Ken
Pour a shot or two of gin, go and invite a few friends
We done tried a few things now you tryna move in
You ain't gotta dude and so I got a few fans
I'm a roll a few grams and follow through with the plan
Hold up
Pour some gin in her cup - she taking shots
Bend her down to the front - she taking shots

One more to get my lungs warm
Two more to get me numb to it
Let me tell you niggas
Feel this, he'll realize
I gotta deodorize all the unsure
Made millions with Shawn Corey
Chief a lot, shout out Reese and them
Shout out, Gleesh and and Lil Meatchi
And peach Ciroc, can't see a nigga writing like an old sharpie
Like a nigga out the globe, with a nigga throwed
Like a cornerback in the flat, nigga in the zone
Like an ornament on a tree, home in the tree
How you gonna eat? Carnivores need beef
Well I need beats
Been doing this, been proving it
Now these niggas give it up like they do at Lent
I just be like ""Yep!"" then I get a rest
Haters trying to fuck with me, give 'em nuts like a stewardess

Ohhh, tryna stay in my zone
I ain't ready to go
And I thought I was on

Five blunts, nigga fired up
Nigga might slide off with y'all joint
I got some later joints, and now joints
I got emergency hoes, like firetrucks

Me and Kid Sensation with that home away from home
In the fat butt dulie with the painted out chrome
15's whippin' in the backside
With the boom boom boom thats how I ride
And Cha Ching I'm a player making ballas holla
I got a girl in Mississippi, but I never call her
Cause it's like that I still got game
I can memorize your number, but I still don't know your name
The conservatives are thinking I'm a pimp (I'm a pimp)
Just because I kind of stroll with a limp (With a limp)
But I still got love for the few who stayed down
But some of my ex's ain't around
Why is that ??
Cause the rock man got them and their butt's just dropped
They started losing weight
Their grill's looking shot
So I switched her
I'm steadily keepin' 'em mixed up
I'm keeping, down and holding my crown and giving them hiccupps
Boo-Hooing (Boo-Hooing)
When you call me
But we was playing on each other so you are wrong, see
Sitting around anti-nails
Your disputing my sales
Fantasizing 'bout counting my mail

(chorus # 2) ( Repeat x4)

[Verse 2: Sir Mix-A-Lot]
Lady listen, Do I really make your man that pissed ?? ( mmm-hmmm)
Flipped it around and tell your man like this (mmm-hmmm)
If you hate Mix, than why you talk about Mix ?
You say you ain't a trick, but you trippin' so she's splittin'
Now she's coming out to Mrs. Ponderosa
She drove a beater so I heard her getting closer
She got an old V-Dub (Volkswagen) with the damaged exaust
But she was fine, so I figured I could toss
And watch the 808 kick drum
Makes this girlie get dumb
She's grabbing on my bum tryin' to get one
And I'm taxing, waxing, I gotta take a note
Frrrtttt!!! Farted on the downstroke (ewwwwweeww)
Playa's in the house can you feel me
Got these playahaters lookin' at me silly
But with this mouthpiece a brother's gotta win
The ladies say you are fine, but your mackin' is kind of thin
No more Broadway, I'm hollering Rainier
Swoop around blocks dropping windows yelling, ""Come Here""
And you complain 'cause I mad a little change
Its all in the game, boy to hell with the fame

[Verse 3: Sir Mix-A-Lot]
I got my buck on them rolling down to Cali
I got a brand new home out in the valley
Jumping off  I-5
I crack a left-eye, got to pick my homey up the attitude adjuster
Seven in a jet black truck with a deaf black G-Lock in case we out of luck
Cause with these haters you gotta keep your strap
Cause we taking all their sugars now they tryin to take us back (Yep)
So you got your and I got mine, so why do you whine about my grind ??
Sitting around blaming Mix-a-Lot for your situation
Boy get a job and quit player hatin'
It ain't about winning your respect
I'm just checking more mail than you check
So heres the finger next to my index
I'm all about your lady
Cause she's all abou the sizex (sex) haha

[Couplet]
Quand j'partirai ne venez pas pleurer sur ma tombe, combien sont sincères ?
Combien de drames, de vraies galères, combien de faux frères ?
Quand j'étais vraiment dans la merde, combien m'ont tendu la main ?
Ne jamais remettre à demain ce qu'on peut faire à une main
Déjà à l'époque, on m'enviait pour une barrette
J'fais d'l'auto-stop sur le chemin du Paradis et seul le Diable s'arrête
Cimetière de Trappes, en p'tite équipe, ramenez pas trop d'de-mon
On vit entre anges et démons, combien me connaissent de nom ?
Quand j'partirai, dites à ma famille que j'les aime
Que mon truc c'est la solitude, que j'ai du mal à dire ""je t'aime""
Quand j'partirai, dites à mon dealer qu'il est au chômage
Drôle de personnage, pas besoin qu'on m'rende hommage
Dites à mes vrais amis que l'amitié s'étend à jamais
Que j'étais nul en maths car quand on aime on n'compte jamais
Vous direz aux matons que l'peura m'a fait changer d'air
Que ma fierté c'est l'Maroc et que j'préfère manger par terre
Aucun remord, j'ai vécu pleinement
Un titulaire sur le terrain, c'est dix rageux qui parlent sur le banc
Quand j'partirai, dites à mon père que rien ne sert de pleurer
Dites à ma fille que ses prières remplaceront les courriers
Dites à mes profs que rien à foutre si j'ai pas eu leurs diplômes
Dites aux rageux que cet album va sûrement peser dix tonnes
Quand j'partirai, vous passerez le salam au Congo
Vous leur direz qu'on y mange bien, vous remercierez le Togo
Le Cameroun et l'Algérie, le Canada, Djibouti
J'aurai p't-êt' un seul remord : ne pas revoir l'public du Mali
J'partirai la tête haute, ma fille, n'écoute pas les gens !
J'ai des souvenirs de Dakar, de quelques frères d'Abidjan
Quand j'partirai, la concurrence pourra sortir d'son trou
Et seulement une fois enterré, vous pourrez prendre son pouls
Je serai pas loin, je serai à jamais dans le cœur d'la famille
De quelques fans anéantis, de quelques sœurs des Antilles
Quand j'serai plus là, vous direz à certains frères qu'ils m'ont déçu
Que moi j'ai pas une belle plume, seulement un putain d'vécu !
Vécues, les années passent et je vois les choses empirer
Seigneur, ayez pitié le jour où j'partirai
Quand j'partirai, certains faux frères feront mine d'être déçus
Veulent rouler avec moi, auparavant m'auraient marché dessus
Dites à mes fans que j'suis fou d'eux, que je n'étais rien sans eux
Que la vie, ça blesse, et qu'il n'y a pas d'fumée sans coup d'feu
Big up à Fred Musa, Pascal Cefran c'est la même
Encore un rap anti-FN sur ta FM
Quand j'partirai, certains bâtards feront leurs condoléances
Où étaient-ils quand les factures arrivaient à échéance ?
Où étaient-ils quand les Restos du Cœur servaient le daron ?
Où étaient-ils quand les huissiers prenaient l'fauteuil du salon ?
Où étaient-ils quand les yeux mouillés, Maman manquait d'liquide ?
Étaient-ils là au mitard, avec une envie d'suicide ?
Les années passent, bordel de merde, et j'vois les choses empirer
Seigneur, ayez pitié le jour où j'partirai

[Outro]
Yeah, le jour où j'partirai, j'emmènerai rien avec moi
Pas d'appartement, pas d'bijou, pas d'voiture
J'ai jamais rappé pour cette merde, t'façon
Et ça, les vrais le savent, depuis mon premier album
Quand j'partirai, la seule chose qui est importante pour moi
C'est qu'j'espère que j'aurai l'temps de dire :
""Achhadou an lâ ilâha illa-llâh, washadou ana Muhammad rasûlu-llâh""
Et j'veux entendre chanter... Fouiny Babe !
J'veux vous entendre chanter...
La réussite, ça génère des inimitiés Fouiny, ça crée des ennemis :
Ton succès se retourne contre toi !
Qu'est-ce que tu vas faire, tuer ton succès ?
Tu préférerais ne pas avoir réussi ?

Ou bien on loupe son coup, et on s'fait quelques amis

Most segregated time of day is Sunday service (My Lord)
Now what you think that say about the God you worship?
First of all, I know it ain't a song that's gon change the world
There's no way
It's not a guilt trip, it's a field trip that's gon' last more than one day

Know some of ya'll done heard that

That's why we raised to hate each other, cause we hate our skin
Lies you told about yourself that you don't realize
I must be a thief, she locked the doors when I was walking by
They must be whores cause the master rapes them
And leaves the child
So dead beat daddy was taught to me way before my time
Now we extreme, buying fancy things like gold chains
Just pretty shackles, we still enslaved
Put 'em round your neck, cuz we still hangin'

You know like, do you love me? Do you want me?
Are you gonna call me like you said you would?
Is this really your real phone number?
But you know I'm a man now, baby, a grown man
And I came a long way, he-he
And experience taught me one thing
Taught me to hold on to my love

[Verse 1]
Sometimes
I just can't help thinkin' livin' without you, baby
See, sometimes, I just can't live cryin' about you, baby
I'm not worried 'bout a doggone thing
I'll take anything you bring
Although I love the sunshine
I'll still accept rain
Cause when I'm in my lonely mood
And I just can't be with you
I tried everything to occupy my mind
And there was no substitute

Thinking all that life would be
When you're not around
I just could not find my way
I wouldn't even know up from down
But since I've had you in my life
All thing can be found
So strong and true, baby
All comin' from you

[Chorus]
You, I call your name, girl (Whenever I am lonely, baby)
I call your name (When I feel the need of love)
I think of you, and it eases the pain
Take away the strain

[Verse 2]
Cause I don't worry what my people say
In my life today
Although they try to say you're not the one for me
I'll love you anyway
Cause their intentions might be cool
If what they say was true
But there's more to you than they could ever see
And they don't even know you

Thinking all that life would be
When you're not around
I just could not find a way
I wouldn't even know up from down
But since I've had you in my life
All things can be found
So strong and true, baby
Comin' from you, you, you, you, you

You, I call your name, girl (Sometimes when I get lonely, baby)
I call your name (When I feel the need of love)
I think of you and it eases the pain
Take away the strain

You, I call your name, girl (Sometimes I get lonely, baby)
I call your name

I think of you and it eases the pain

It seems like someone else is out there
Oh, thinkin' of holding someone else tight
So you will know where I'm comin' from
Oh, when I'm lonely, when I'm discouraged
Oh, I call your name, baby

There is no substitute for you
No one could take your place
You're more than they can ever receive
That's why I call your name

Oh, baby, when I am lonely
When I am discouraged
I call your name, girl
I think of you and it eases the pain

It's always the same and you know who's to blame
You know what I'm saying, still we keep on playing

Come with me, stay the night
You say the words, but boy, it don't feel right
What do ya expect me to say?

You take my hand, and you say you've changed

Because to you, it's just a game

503,Savannah Nights,"Well, when the night falls
Way down in Savannah
Well, you can find him down on Fourth Street
Hidden out in the night

Ran into his good time buddies
Never gonna need no rest
Walking round in his dancing shoes
Gonna put em to the test

Look out, world
Cause here he comes
Moving through the night
The kids are looking for the good time

There`s a lady
And she`s standing in the corner
But she`s a little but shy
She needs some coaxing on the dance floor

But pretty soon
She caught his eye
Now he`s moving in
Beauty`s shy
But in her eyes
She starts his head to spin

He keeps up all the dancing
Starts them both to swing
Now they`re getting to a good thing

He is the king of Savannah nights
The inspiration
The ladies delight
You could not catch him
If you wanted to try tonight

He is the king of Savannah nights

You know we takin’ it back
You know we takin’ it back
You know we takin’ it back
You know we takin’ it back
You know we takin’ it back

[Strofa 1]
Back on the track non ti porto respect
Sono stronzo mica trash, sono sporco mica swag
Vuoi il vestito? Vuoi lo smoking? Non è Men in Black
Chiudo i giochi a pugni in faccia con lo slang, questo è Tekken 3! Che manata, midollo da lumaca
Vieni contro il “chupacapra que te matas!”
La fotta è cosa sacra quindi rappo “shut the fuck up”
Se da sopra il palco ti urlo in faccia: “Blacka Blacka Blacka”
La mia fame non si placa sono l’ugly mother fucker
Vedi il demone di Osaka che spalanca tutti i chakra
Qui l’hip-hop è una figata ma se ascolti Waka Flocka
Mentre pompi ""Waka Waka"" lame in faccia da Baraka
Fatti quattro passi e dopo vedi chi c’è
Dei bastardi succhiacazzi troppo pieni di sé
Tu fai musica per falsi e mi ripeti clichés
Alle stronzate dopo credici te

[Ritornello]
You know we takin’ it back
You know we takin’ it back
You know we takin’ it back
You know we takin’ it back
You know we takin’ it back

[Strofa 2]
Oh! Guess who’s back?
Il rapper mezzo metallaro che fa tanto il nerd
Sono così e me ne vanto, e tu lo sai il perché?
So cos’è il pogo, l’8 bit e spruzzo col fat cap, yeh
Troppi “bla, bla” fuori dagli standard
La famiglia santa, la bamba in tasca
Stanno muti 'sti fighetti con la barca
Due minuti netti e gli ho pisciato sulla giacca
Get the fuck up
Fino a che la testa non si stacca
Un’unica nazione doppia H e il commando di Zulu
Nella giungla dell’amianto sono al canto di Cthulhu
Se potessi andrei via da qua
La gente cambia identità come Mattia Pascal
Questa va alla mia bambina che è diversa dalle altre
Non sei l’unica che si trova una figa fra le gambe
Pam! Pam! Sulla troia che mi balla il Can-Can
Per levarmi il fiato in gola come fossi Saddam ma-dame
Perdo amici ma non perdo il controllo
Prima me la lego al dito e dopo te la lego al collo, ciao

High noon, oh I'd sell my soul for water
Nine years worth of breakin' my back
There's no sun in the shadow of the wizard
See how he glides, why he's lighter than air?
Oh, I see his face

[Pre-Chorus]
Where is your star?
Is it far, is it far, is it far?
When do we leave?
I believe, yes, I believe

[Chorus]
In the heat and the rain
With whips and chains
To see him fly
So many died
We build a tower of stone
With our flesh and bone
Just to see him fly
But don't know why
Now where do we go?

[Verse 2]
Hot wind, moving fast across the desert
We feel that our time has arrived
The world spins, while we put his dream together
A tower of stone to take him straight to the sky
Oh, I see his face

[Pre-Chorus]
Where is your star?
Is it far, is it far, is it far?
When do we leave?
Hey, I believe, I believe

[Chorus]
In the heat and the rain
With whips and chains
Just to see him fly
Too many died
We build a tower of stone
With our flesh and bone
To see him fly
But we don't know why
Ooh, now where do we go

[Instrumental break 3:31-5:12]
[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
All eyes see the figure of the wizard
As he climbs to the top of the world
No sound, as he falls instead of rising
Time standing still, then there's blood on the sand
Oh, I see his face

[Pre-Chorus]
Where was your star?
Was it far, was it far?
When did we leave?
We believed, we believed, we believed

[Chorus]
In heat and rain
With the whips and chains
To see him fly
So many died
We built a tower of stone
With our flesh and bone
To see him fly
But why
In all the rain
With all the chains
Did so many die
Just to see him fly
Look at my flesh and bone
Now, look, look, look, look
Look at his tower of stone
I see a rainbow rising
Look there, on the horizon
And I'm coming home, I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Time is standing still
He gave back my will
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Going home
I'm going home
My eyes are bleeding
And my heart is leaving here
But it's not home
But it's not home

Take me back
He gave back my will
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Close your tired eyes, relax and then
Count from 1 to 10 and open them

And you can stay up there, right next to me
All this gravity will try to pull you down, but not this time

And fan the flame so hot, it melt our hearts

And illuminate a world that'll try to bring you down, but not this time

And makes this dark planet come alive

You will have no time for grieving
Chiquitita, you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky
And shining above you
(Even though you cry)
(The sun is shining in the sky)
Let me hear you sing once more
(So let me hear you sing some more)
Like you did before
(The way you used to do before)
Sing a new song, Chiquitita
Try once more, like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita

514,Rapper's Delight,"[Hook 1: Wonder Mike]
I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop and you don't stop
The rock it to the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

[Verse 1: Wonder Mike]
Now, what you hear is not a test, I'm rapping to the beat
And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet
See I am Wonder Mike and I'd like to say ""hello""
To the black, to the white, the red and the brown, the purple and yellow
But first, I gotta bang bang the boogie to the boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie
Let's rock, you don't stop
Rock the rhythm that'll make your body rock
Well so far you've heard my voice, but I brought two friends along
And next on the mic is my man Hank; come on, Hank, sing that song

[Verse 2: Big Bank Hank]
Check it out, I'm the C-A-S-AN, the O-V-A and the rest is F-L-Y
You see, I go by the code of the doctor of the mix and these reasons I'll tell you why
You see I'm six foot one and I'm tons of fun and I dress to a tee
You see I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali and I dress so viciously
I got bodyguards, I got two big cars, that definitely ain't the whack
I got a Lincoln continental and a sunroof Cadillac
So after school, I take a dip in the pool, which is really on the wall
I got a color TV so I can see the Knicks play basketball
Hear me talking 'bout checkbooks, credit cards, more money than a sucker could ever spend
But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum from the Rucker, not a dime 'til I made it again

[Hook 2: Big Bank Hank]
Everybody go: Hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today (say what?)
Cause I'ma get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go: Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
You see, if your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend

[Post-Hook: Big Bank Hank]
Uh Master Gee, my mellow?
It's on you so what you gonna do?

[Verse 3: Master Gee]
Well it's on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
I said a M-A-S, a T-E-R, a G with a double E
I said I go by the unforgettable name of the man they call the Master Gee
Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls
I'm going down in history
As the baddest rapper there ever could be
Now I'm feeling the highs and you're feeling the lows
The beat starts getting into your toes
You start popping your fingers and stomping your feet
And moving your body while you're sitting in your seat
And then damn, you start doing the freak
I said damn, right outta your seat
Then you throw your hands high in the air
You're rocking to the rhythm, shake your derriere
You're rocking to the beat without a care
With the sure-shot emcees for the affair
Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same
I got a little face and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do ladies is hypnotize
Singing on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singing on and on and on, on and on
Like a hot ready to pop the pop the pop dibbie dibbie
Pop the pop, pop, you don't dare stop
Come alive y'all gimme what you got
I guess by now you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay, I still keep in stride
Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind
Singing on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singing on and on and on, on and on
Rock rock y'all get on the floor

[Hook 3: Master Gee]
I'm gonna freak ya here I'm gonna freak you there
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere

[Post-Hook: Master Gee]
Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind
I'll put t-t-tickets in your behind
I said 1-2-3-4, come on, girls, get on the floor
Uh, come alive, y'all gimme what ya got
Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said 1-2-3-4, tell me Wonder Mike what are you waiting for?

[Hook 1: Wonder Mike]
I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop and you don't stop

Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

[Verse 4: Wonder Mike]
Skiddlee beebop a we rock a scooby doo
And guess what, America: we love you
Cause ya rock and ya roll with so much soul
You could rock 'til you're a hundred and one years old
I don't mean to brag I don't mean to boast
But we like hot butter on a breakfast toast
Rock it up, uh, baby bubbah
Baby bubbah to the boogie the bang bang the boogie
To the beat beat, it's so unique
Come on, everybody, and dance to the beat

[Bridge: Intro sound: 16 measures]

[Hook 1: Wonder Mike]
I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop and you don't stop
The rock it to the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

[Verse 5: Wonder Mike]
I said I can't wait 'til the end of the week
When I'm rapping to the rhythm of a groovy beat
An attempt to raise your body heat
Just blow your mind so that you can't speak
To do a thing but a rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called the freak
And when ya finally do come into your rhythmic beat
Rest a little while so ya don't get weak
I know a man named Hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on Hank, uh, sing that song
To the rhythm of the boogie the bang bang the bong

[Verse 6: Big Bank Hank]
Well, I'm Imp the Dimp the ladies pimp
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside, into the front
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker emcees try to prove a point
We're treacherous trio, uh, with a serious joint
A from sun to sun and from day to day
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mic til you can't resist
Everybody, I say it goes like this
Well I was coming home late one dark afternoon
Reporter stopped me for a interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntables
This young reporter I did adore
So I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before
She said ""damn fly guy I'm in love with you""
The Casanova legend must have been true
I said by the way baby what's your name
Said ""I go by the name of Lois Lane""
And you could be my boyfriend you surely can
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman
I said he's a fairy I do suppose
Flying through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy or even cute
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit
I said you need a man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night
But can he rock a party 'til the early light
He can't satisfy you with his little worm
But I can bust you out with my super sperm
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it
An I'm here and I'm there I'm Big Bank Hank, I'm everywhere
Just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it, uh, don't stop y'all, uh, tick a tock y'all you don't stop

[Hook 2: Big Bank Hank]
I go: Hotel, motel, what you gonna do today (say what)
I'm gonna get a fly girl gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go: Hotel, motel, holiday inn
You see, if your girl starts acting up then you take her friend

[Post-Hook: Big Bank Hank]
I say skip, dive, what can I say
I can't fit em all inside my OJ
So I just take half and bust them out
I give the rest to Master Gee so he could shock the house

[Verse 7: Master Gee]
It was 12 o'clock one Friday night
I was rocking to the beat and feeling all right
Everybody was dancing on the floor
Doing all the things they never did before
And then this fly fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar, she came into the scene
As she traveled deeper inside the room
All the fellas checked out her white Sassons
She came up to the table, looked into my eyes
Then she turned around and shook her behind
So I said to myself, its time for me to release
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece
And now people in the house this is just for you
A little rap to make you boogaloo
Now the group ya hear is called Phase Two
And let me tell ya something we're a hell of a crew
Once a week we're on the street
Just a-cutting the jams and making it free
For you to party, got to have the moves
So we'll get right down and give you a groove
For you to dance you got to be hype
So we'll get right down for you tonight
Now the system's on and the girls are there
You definitely have a rocking affair
But let me tell ya something there's still one fact
That to have a party ya got to have a rap
So when the party's over, you're making it home
And trying to sleep before the break of dawn
And while ya sleeping you start to dream
And thinking how ya danced on the disco scene
A name appears in your mind
Yeah, a name you know that was right on time
It was phase two just a doing a do
Rocking ya down cause ya know we could
To the rhythm of the beat that makes ya freak
Come alive girls get on your feet
To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that it makes ya freak
To the rhythm of the beat that says you go on
On and on into the break of dawn
Now I got a man coming on right now
He's guaranteed to throw down
He goes by the name of Wonder Mike
Come on Wonder Mike do what ya like

[Verse 8: Wonder Mike]
Like a can of beer that's sweeter than honey
Like a millionaire that has no money
Like a rainy day that is not wet
Like a gambling fiend that does not bet
Like Dracula without his fangs
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang
Like collard greens that don't taste good
Like a tree that's not made out of wood
Like going up and not coming down
Is just like the beat without the sound, no sound
To the beat beat, ya do the freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat
Have you ever went over a friend's house to eat
And the food just ain't no good
I mean the macaroni's soggy the peas are mushed
And the chicken tastes like wood
So you try to play it off like you think you can
By saying that you're full
And then your friend says ""momma he's just being polite
He ain't finished uh-uh that's bull""
So your heart starts pumping and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says ""man there's plenty of food""
So you pile some more on your plate
While the stinky food's steaming your mind starts to dreaming
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rotting
Into something that looks like cheese
Oh so you say that's it I got to leave this place
I don't care what these people think
I'm just sitting here making myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks
So you bust out the door while its still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of kaopectate
And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says ""I understand about the food
Baby but bubbah we're still friends""

[Hook 1: Wonder Mike]
With a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop and you don't stop
The rock it to the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

[Post-Hook: Wonder Mike]
I say ""Hank can ya rock?
Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?
Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo""
I said ""come on, make uh, make the people move""

[Verse 9: Big Bank Hank]
I go to the halls and then ring the bell
Because I am the man with the clientele
And if ya ask me why I rock so well
I'm Big Bank, I got clientele
And from the time I was only six years old
I never forgot what I was told
It was the best advice that I ever had
It came from my wise dear old dad
He said ""sit down punk I wanna talk to you
And don't say a word until I'm through
Now there's a time to laugh a time to cry
A time to live and a time to die
A time to break and a time to chill
To act civilized or act real ill
But whatever ya do in your lifetime
Ya never let a MC steal your rhyme""
So from six to six 'til this very day
Ill always remember what he had to say
So when the sucker emcees try to chump my style
I let them know that I'm versatile
I got style, finesse and a little black book
That's filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look
But there's a thing that separates you from me
And that is called originality
Because my rhymes are on from what you heard
I didn't even bite and not a godd--m word
And I say a little more later on tonight
So the sucker emcees can bite all night
Uh, tick a tock y'all, a beat, beat y'all
A lets rock y'all, ya don't stop

[Hook 2: Big Bank Hank]
It go: Hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today (say what)
Cause I'ma get a fly girl gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go: Hotel, motel, holiday inn
You see if your girl starts acting up then you take her friends

[Post-Hook: Big Bank Hank]
A like that y'all to the beat y'all
A beat, beat y'all ya don't stop
Uh, Master Gee am I mellow?
Its on you so whatcha gonna do?

[Verse 10: Master Gee]
Well like Johnny Carson on the late show
A like Frankie Crocker in stereo
Well like the  Bar-Kays singing 'Holy Ghost'
The sounds to throw down they're played the most
Just like my man Captain Sky
Whose name he earned with his super sperm
We rock and we don't stop
Get off y'all I'm here to give you whatcha got
To the beat that it makes you freak
And come alive girl, uh, get on your feet
A like a Perry Mason without a case
Like Farrah Fawcett without her face
Like the barkays on the mic
Like getting right down for you tonight
Like moving your body so ya don't know how
Right to the rhythm and throw down
Like coming alive to the Master Gee
The brother who rocks so viciously
I said the age of one my life begun
At the age of two I was doing the do
At the age of three it was you and me
Rocking to the sounds of the Master Gee
At the age of four I was on the floor
Giving all the freaks what they bargained for
At the age of five I didn't take no jive
With the Master Gee its all the way live
At the age of six I was uh, picking up sticks
Rapping to the beat my stick was fixed
At the age of seven I was rocking in heaven
Dontcha know I went off
I got right on down to the beat you see
Getting right on down making all the girls
Just take of their clothes to the beat the beat
To the double beat, beat that makes you freak
At the age of eight I was, uh,  really great
Cause every night you see I had a date
At the age of nine I was, uh, right on time
Cause every night I had a part to rhyme
Going on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
A saying on and on and on, on and on
Like a hot buttered the pop the pop the popcorn
A saying on and on and on on and on
Cause I'm a helluva man when I'm on the mic
I am the definite feast delight
I'm a helluva man when I'm on the mic
I am the definite feast delight
Call me the master gee you see
The brother who rocks so viciously

[Hook 3: Master Gee]
I'm gonna freak ya here I'm gonna freak ya there
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere

She won't wait up tonight
I can take the long way home
And there won't be any fights
Tonight I can stay out late with the boys
Play cards and come in at dawn
Since she left me I've got a choice
I can take the long way home

No pictures on the wall
No carpet on the floor
No one ever calls
No one knocks on my door
It's just a place where I sleep at night
But I can't sleep alone
I think I'll stop off and have a bite
And take the long way home

What makes a house a home
Is sometimes hard to say
You never know all the riches you own
Till someone takes them away

The rose die on the vine
Somebody's heart gets broken
Usually it's mine
I don't want to take the chance
Of being hurt again
And you and I can't say good-bye
So if you wake and find me gone
Oh baby carry you see I need my
Fantasy I still believe it's best
To leave while I'm in love
Too many times I've seen
The rose die on the vine
Somebody's heart gets broken usually

And you and I can't say good-bye

Is it wrong to feel so insecure and so unappealing?
Why walk around in disguise with a fake grin on my face?

What would I gain?
I'd still feel so out of place

Damned if I do
Damned if I don't
But I won't turn out like you
Damned if I do
Damned if I don't
But I won't turn out like you

Midlife crisis at the age of 22, who knew?
I need some answers cross the street
And down the avenue I stopped
For the woman and paid five bucks
Got my palm read and she said:
""You shouldn't be smiling boy
This life line says you're already dead.""

Just keep on moving forward never turning back
But with every step ahead I take they pull me two steps back
They pull me two steps back

Damned if I don't

Hey, I'm so weak, won't somebody shut off that light

And I watch it from this hole I call home
And all the stony's are dancin' to the radio

Tonight on the phone

I need a lover that won't drive me crazy
Some girl that knows the meaning of, uh
""Hey, hit the highway""

Well, I'm not wiped out by this poolroom life I'm living
I'm gonna quit this job, and go to school, or head back home
And I'm not askin' to be loved or be forgiven

524,Half The Way,"When I was young
Iused to run inside for tea
Made for me

She said don’t drink it down too fast
And I listened though I did not understand

I could run only half the way
Though she loved me more than I can say
How could I falter?
How could I fall?
Though I’d remember I would not call

When I was young she said, “Pick out the toys
That you want
I’ll see what I can do
Did I take care of you?
By the way
A dollar or two can go a very long way
Use it to buy anything you want.”

The droning sound of the rosary
Etched in my heart
More than a memory

How could I falter?
How could I fall?
Though I’d remember I would not call

It’s only me
You got two eyes
Why can’t you see?
There was no disguise",IZZ,1980,"[85, 33]",2

Yeah!
We on Squaria!
Hahahaha, yeah!

[Verse 1]
What planet did you come from?
With your nails, makeup, and hair done
At my show, hands up to the sun
Ask her what she’s doing when it’s done
So we gon' kick it, have a little fun
Play me in Street Fighter 4 and won
Chun Li kicks, hair in a bun
Marvelous sweats, All-Star Chucks
What you smoke? what you drink?
Green Ty-Ku? What you think?
Bra all black, panties pink
I’mma see that by the end of the week
We take it slow, I'll take you home
Your moms don't trip, cause, shit, you grown
She said ""You gon' let me sleep alone?""
I said nah, she said, ""Come on""

[Hook]
I don’t know just where you came from
I need you now
If you leave me for the stars
That's something something I'd never allow

[Interlude]
Oh, she cold
Yeah see, I knew she wasn’t from here
That’s why I call her Foreign Exchange Student
Cause she’s like fresh as fuck
Louboutins, Alexander Wang and all that
But at the same time, she plays Marvel vs Capcom 3
Listens to The Pixies religiously
And had like a 16 killstreak on Black Ops! Haha!

[Verse 2]
I don’t know your circle, circle
But you like this square right here
I know your ex hurt you, hurt you
But don’t be scared, be scared
I'll take you high, so high, up in the air, the air
George Clooney cool and I don’t Bugs, that’s Looney Tunes
You come backstage, my crew is cool
Mass Effect 2 and watch kung-fu
Grabbing these snacks like Scooby Doo
Smoke 'til your eyes like Lucy Liu
She knows I ball cause she asks for shots
Hit a triple double when I pass the Ciroc
If love is blind then I’m Matt Murdock
You ain’t going home, well I’m glad you not

[Outro]
To all the ladies
Or should I say, Squarian women out there that this applies to
I wish I could send you some beautiful flowers
Or a teddybear or something, but I can’t
So I’m gonna have Awesome Sound play the synth solo
Just for you baby, just for you, check it out

526,Broken Hearted Me,"Every now and then
I cry
Every night
You keep staying on my mind

All my friends say I'll survive
It just takes time
But I don't think time is gonna heal this broken heart

No
I don't see how it can if it's broken all apart
A million miracles could never stop the pain
Or put all the pieces together again

No
I don't think time is gonna heal this broken heart
No
I don't see how it can while we are still apart

And when you hear this song
I hope that you will see
That time won't heal a broken-hearted me

Every day is just the same
Playing games, different lovers, different names
They keep saying I'll survive
It just takes time
But I don't think time is gonna heal this broken heart

No
I don't see how it can if it's broken all apart
A million miracles could never stop the pain
Or put all the pieces together again

Soon found out I was losing my mind
It seemed like the real thing but I was so blind
Much o' mistrust, love's gone behind

When you need me
I'll be around
You're still on my mind
But I guess until
This feeling leaves me
I'm all alone
On the other side
Well I still have dreams
Where you still love me
That probably comes
As a surprise
But those dreams
Seem so foolish
When I remember the day
You walked right by
Is this good-bye
I'll never know why
We never talked
At all about it
I don't know why
Don't know whose fault
Soon I'll be gone
And for a long time

And too far gone
To work it all out
Well I still have dreams
Where you still love me

As a surprise

Seem so foolish

536,Rainbow Connection,"Why are there so many songs about rainbows and what's on the other side?
Rainbows are visions, but only illusions
And rainbows have nothing to hide
So we've been told and some choose to believe it
I know they're wrong wait and see

Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers, and me
Who said that every wishe would be heard and answered
When wished on the morningstar

Someone thought of that and someone believed it
And look what it's done so far
What's so amazing that keeps us stargazing
And what do we think we might see?

Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers, and me
All of us under its spell
We know that it's probably magic
Have you been half asleep and have you heard voices?
I've heard them calling my name

Is this the sweet sound that call the young sailors
The voice might be one and the same

I've heard it too many times to ignore it
It's something that I'm supposed to be

Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers, and me",Sleeping at Last,1980,[95],1
537,You Decorated My Life,"All my life was a paper once plain, pure and white
Till you moved with your pen changing moods now and then
Till the balance was right
Then you added some music, every note was in place
And anybody could see all the changes in me by the look on my face

And you decorated my life, created a world where dreams are a part
And you decorated my life by painting your love all over my heart
You decorated my life

Like a rhyme with no reason in an unfinished song
There was no harmony life meant nothin' to me, until you came along
And you brought out the colors, what a gentle surprise
Now I'm able to see all the things life can be shining soft in your eyes

And you decorated my life, created a world where dreams are a part
And you decorated my life by painting your love all over my heart
You decorated my life",Kenny Rogers,1980,[97],1

Drankin' water, tryna save my liver
Walked in, seen some naked strippers
Couple homies started throwin' money
I just watch you like a babysitter, I'm lit
Stuck where I sit
