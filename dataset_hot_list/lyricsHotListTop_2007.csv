I just want you close
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better

[Pre-Chorus]
You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause

People keep talking, they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright

Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you

Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one

No more time left to be here

To be everything that I've been looking for

How many really know what love is?
Millions never will
Do you know until you lose it?
That it's everything that we are looking for
When I wake up in the morning
And you're beside me
I'm so thankful that I found
Everything that I've been looking for

I clearly see bitches ain't shit, they just want see me cry
Young nigga rollin', keep that Glock 'cause shit ain't safe out at night
I say the money and betrayal got my mind hypnotized

[Verse 1]
Lies, that's what they told me
I never asked for shit at night, only for you to hold me
I did it out of love, baby, never said you owed me
Now I don't wanna fuck with you, it's gonna kill me slowly
Straight out that north, I made it out, don't mix me in the shit they say
My feelings fallin', money callin', how we movin', shit ain't safe
I'm roamin' through LA alone with a burner on my waist
At night, I pray I make it home, them pussy boys know where I stay, might jump the gate
But fuck that, I'm strapped up, ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Somethin' must be in them nigga's head wrong if they thinkin', I ain't clutchin'
Can't take cover when I start bustin'
Leave 'em like one said they love me
Patrol still wanna cuff me
No love for one, say fuck me
You supposed to be the one I run to, but you ain't 'round
Never knew to succumb to, I don't know how
I lost my love for that dream and I don't know if it could be found
You always bringin' some shit up, never once tried to put you down

Nobody I'm trustin'

You was billing your budget
You see me with bitches you think that I cherish
You ask them a question, they can't tell you nothin'
Bad news and it's comin' out ugly
Truth be told, you was plottin' on somethin'
Money mean nothin' when you really love someone
How I be livin' take up time and we could have a one on one
And fuckin' off ain't that important when you really for someone
I'm scared to open up my heart, I always been so nonchalant
I just wanna live with you, build with you, smoke with you, yeah
I know you think the shit I say
But you just wanna misuse me and lie, said that I ain't never cared
You left yo' diary by the bed

Running through the heat, heart beat
You shine like silver in the sunlight
You light up my cold heart
It feels right in the sun, the sun
We're running around and 'round
Like nothing else could matter in our lives
But wait, but wait, but wait
The sun will stop shining soon
And you'll be dark in my life
Yeah, you'll be gone
It's as simple as a change of heart
But I'm not gonna think about the future

[Chorus]
A love like this won't last forever
I know that a love like this won't last forever
But I, I don't really mind
I don't really mind at all

[Verse 2]
Step into the night, love
It grows dark but you don't mind
Hiding in the back streets, yeah, you'll never notice me
All that I was thinking about
Was cleaning up my conscience
Lost in the memory as it shakes up the corners of my heart
Was it my mistake?
Or maybe it was just as simple as a change in your heart
Mm, just as simple as a change of heart

[Chorus]
I know now, a love like this won't last forever
I know that a love like this won't last forever

22,Sweetest Girl (Dollar Bill),"[Intro: Wyclef Jean, Lil Wayne]
Some live for the bill, some kill for the bill
She whined for the bill, grind for the bill
And she used to be the sweetest girl
Some steal for the bill, if they got to pay they bill
And she used to be the sweetest girl
Tonight Wyclef, Akon, Weezy on the bill

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
High school, she was that girl
That make me do the hula hoop around the gym
(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)
High school she was that girl
That make me do the hula hoop around the gym
(Just to get a peek again, she's a 10)
Never thought that she would come and work for the president
Mr. George Washington (where my money at?)
She balls, he calls (where my money at?)
She had a good day, bad day, sunny day, rainy day
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)
Closed legs don't get fed
Go out there and make my bread
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)
She ended up in the wrong car
Bruised up, scarred hard
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)
She balls, he calls (where my money at?)

[Verse 2: Akon]
Pimpin' got harder 'cause hoes got smarter
On the strip is somethin' they don't wanna be a part of
Rather be up in the club, shakin' for a dub
Get triple times the money and spendin' it like they wanna
They got they mind on they money, money on they mind
They got they finger on the trigger, hand on the 9
See, everyday they feel the struggle but stayin' on they grind
And ain't nobody takin' from us, and that's the bottom line
But I know there's a drop in the block
You move slow, you gettin' pressure from cops
You don't know whether or not to lay low
'Cause 25 to life is no joke
To all my real guerillas thuggin'
On top of corners every day strugglin'
All the beautiful women's gettin' money
Washin' them dollar bills like laundry

And she used to be the sweetest girl!

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
She used to be the sweetest girl ever
Whatever, now she like sour amaretto
She wears a dress to the T like the letter
And if you make it rain she will be under the weather
She used to run track back in high school
Now she tricks on the track right by school
She take the loss 'cause she don't wanna see her child lose
So respect her, or pay up for the time used
And then she runs to the pastor
And he tells her there will be a new chapter
But she feels no different after
And then she ask him: ""Where my money at?""

Can't he tell that I can't breathe?

Said where you going man you know the world is headed for hell

Tell 'em same thing I used to get for the blow
Set 'em on the raw, nigga, what I got to lose?

Everybody come equipped with bangers
Throwin' up our middle fingers
And you know I don't slip
So I gotta keep ten in the clip and one in the chamber
Better be walkin' with angels
And never take candy from strangers
Through the stress and strife
Had to earn my stripes like I played with the Bengals
I'm in the zone, holmes, goin' for the two-point conversion
I'm so hood that Ludacris shoulda been on the original version
But this is the remix, with the cheap tricks, hittin' sweet licks
And I cut the braids off
But the waves and the fade'll make you sea-sick
See this is the way that we ball
And this is the way that we brawl
So put a fist in the air if you care
That united we stand and divided we fall
When the South's in the house, better watch your mouth
'Cause we on that hood shit
I'm hood rich, comin' around your hood, bitch, I swear I'm so—

I'm out the hood! And if you feel me, put your hands up
Hood! My hood niggas, can you stand up?

Khaled, they actin' like we ain't
The kings of the streets and the gods of the hood
Busta Bust, bitches!

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
See all I know is how to go and get my money g-gain and again
Top down, let the money blow in the wind
With a bad bitch sittin' in the passenger seat
With a doobie-wrapped head full of bobbie pins
You know I keep that thang when I walk
See the dialect different from the slang in my talk
Baby still leavin', got a crackhead frontin'
Got another bad bitch that'll boost for the spark
I'm used to leavin' the strip last
Hustlin' until the sun comes up gettin' cash
So much bread in all of my four pockets
It look like a nigga got hips with an ass
And from the DNA in my blood
Niggas idolize me and try to do what I does
And if that other nigga ain't really from the hood
You can easily die, take who that fake nigga was
And even though I spit a little rap
Got niggas in the hood try to sell the most crack
Violator, I send a nigga to do it just to make you spend a lot of money just to get your shit back
Y'all niggas know where I'm from
And I rep it to the fullest 'til the day that I'm done
So hood where we live, if a nigga sold drugs
And he rich Momma still proud of her son

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Daddy Fat Sacks so hood like a Cadillac ornament
On from the Baby-lon
Call an ambulance to come and pick that ass up
'Cause the nigga never had the chance
They try to dance with the devil in a pale moonlight,
Advance on a level that they can't do right
Lay hands on a fella like a man in blue lights
Whoop, whoop! Do it twice!
Your boy the B-I-G
I'm nicer than MC on your top three
You cocky, I cock, squeeze
Bust them things, now you sloppy
Speed it up, slow it down then screw it
Don't bite the flow 'cause I got that fluid
Run through the crew on some whole other new shit
Newness, bitch, we do this

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm out the hood! And if you feel me, put your hands up
Hood! My hood niggas, can you stand up?
I'm so hood! If you not from here you can walk it out
And you not hood if you don't know what I'm talkin' 'bout
I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm so hood! (Alright… Weezy)

[Verse 5: Lil Wayne]
I'm so Hollygrove, New Orleans, Lil Weezy-ana
Home sweet Home De-pot, you will need a hammer
It go down like Frasier, I ain't talkin' Kelsey Grammer
I be shittin' on you boys, I need an Alka-Seltzer sandwich (HOOD)
Since I heard Plies I done bought the Phantom back
Went and got me a fifty-two inch Maybach
I'm eatin' like a big dog, I'm so full
I'm so good, I'm so straight, you so fake, I'm so real, I'm so (hood!)
(Coca, ghetto gatka, haha
Yup, crack, crack, crack, cr-cr-cr-cr)

[Verse 6: Fat Joe]
Yeah nigga, welcome to the Crackhouse
I should own a McDonald's the way I bring the MAC's out
I'm from the hood where every nigga lies
Flip a couple grams they tell you they bakin' pies
Shit, still got my name carved in that central bookin'
Gave that pussy a scar and told her good lookin'
You's a crack baby, that means your momma paid me
You can't even blame me, that's what the hood made me

[Verse 7: Birdman]
Martin Luther King, Calliope, Magnolia, Melphamine
Gettin' that money with the triple beam

Thirteen is where I lay, shouts out to MIA

Mo' money, mo' problems, don't call me conceited
Just call me the boss, always got what you needed
MIA oh so hot but my neck got the fever
If you sneeze you get shot, gunplay makin' believers

There's nothing to compare it to

She wants to see, if there's more
Than he gave
She's looking for

He doesn't want her out there and alone now
He knows she's moving it
Knows she's using it
Now he's losing it
She don't care

Working hard to find the things she mentioned
He was dedicated, by most suckers hated

He's trying to forget her; that's how he got with her

Stop what you're doing, you don't want to ruin
The chance that you got to find a new one

She's got a body like an hourglass, it's ticking like a clock
It's a matter of time before we all run out
When I thought he was mine, she caught him by the mouth
I waited eight long months, she finally set him free
I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me
Two weeks and we caught on fire
She's got it out for me, but I wear the biggest smile

Second chances, they don't ever matter, people never change
Once a whore you're nothing more
I'm sorry, that'll never change
And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged
I'm sorry honey, but I passed it up, now look this way
Well, there's a million other girls who do it just like you
Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
They want and what they like
It's easy if you do it right
Well I refuse, I refuse, I refuse!

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Perhaps I was addicted to the dark side
Somewhere inside my childhood witnessed my heart die
And even though we both came from the same places
The money and the fame made us all change places
How could it be? Through the misery that came to pass
The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask
For currency, but you could run to me when you need
And I'll never leave, honestly
Someone to believe in, as you can see
It's a small thing to a true, what could I do?
Real homies help you get through
And come to knew he'd do the same thing if he could
‘Cause in the hood, true homies make you feel good
And half the times we be actin' up, call the cops
Bringin' a cease to the peace that was on my block
It never stops, when my mama ask me will I change
I tell her yeah, but it's clear I'll always be the same
Until the end of time

So I can fly away, until the end of time

Please, Lord, forgive me for my life of sin
My hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids
So you know, I don't hang around the house much
This all-night money makin' got me outta touch
Shit, ain't flashed a smile in a long while
An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs
My attitude got me walkin' solo
Ride out alone in my lo-lo
Watchin' the whole world move in slow-mo
For quiet times, disappear, listen to the ocean
Smokin' Ports, think my thoughts, then it's back to coastin'
Who can I trust in this cold world?
My phony homie had a baby by my old girl
But I ain't trippin', I'm a player, I ain't sweatin' him
I sexed his sister, had her mumble like a Mexican
His next of kin, no remorse, it was meant to happen
Besides rappin', the only thing I did good was scrappin'

Now who's to say if I was right or wrong
To live my life as an outlaw all along?
Remain strong in this planet full of player haters
They conversate, but Death Row full of demonstrators
And in the end, drinkin' Hennessy
Made all my enemies envy me
So cold when I flow, eliminatin' easily
Falls to they knees, they plead for they right to breathe
While beggin' me to keep the peace (haha)
When I conceive closer to achieve
In times of danger, don't freeze, time to be a G
Follow my lead, I'll supply everything you need
An ounce of game and the training to make a G
Remember me as an outcast Outlaw
Another album out, that's what I'm about: more
Gettin' raw 'til the day I see my casket

She don't believe in shootin' stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's departments
You more like ""love to start shit""
I'm more of the trips to Florida
Ordered the hors d'oeuvres, views of the water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man, why can't life always be this easy?
She in the mirror dancin' so sleazy
I get a call like, ""Where are you, Yeezy?""
And try to hit you with the ol-wu-wopte
'Til I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than the Nazis

If somebody woulda told me a year ago
It'll go get this difficult
Feelin' like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no Visa

Now even though I try to play it off

And I can't wait for shorty to come through
From your lips and back up to your eyes
My hands on your hips when we grind
I'm fantasizin' 'bout what I'm gon' do to you
Got me fiendin' for her love, can't lie
Man, you should see how she got me
Spendin' all this time with her
And I couldn't leave her if I wanted to
Her love turns men into fools
Tell me what a man is to do

Whenever we up in this bed
And my fingers all in your hair
I wonder if you feel me watchin' you
'Cause I can't go a night without your lovin'
And got me lookin' at this phone
Every time it rings, I hope it's you, girl
Got me bracin' for your love
And I've fallen for you, I can't lie
I just wanna be with you
And, yes, she got me there, I said it
Somebody call the paramedics
Tell 'em to hurry up and come through

And these motherfuckers hit the ceiling

[Verse 1]
I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I make fight music for high school kids
I put lives at risk when I drive like this
I put wives at risk with a knife like this
Shit, you probably think I'm in your tape deck now
I'm in the back seat of your truck with duct tape stretched out
Ducked the fuck way down, waitin' to straight jump out
Put it over your mouth, and grab you by the face — what now?
Oh, you want me to watch my mouth
How? Take my fuckin' eyeballs out and turn them around?
Look, I'll burn your fuckin' house down, circle around
And hit the hydrant, so you can't put your burnin' furniture out
I'm sorry, there must be a mix-up
You want me to fix up lyrics
While our President gets his dick sucked?
Fuck that! Take drugs, rape sluts
Make fun of gay clubs, men who wear make-up
Get aware, wake up, get a sense of humor
Quit tryin' to censor music
This is for your kid's amusement (the kids!)
But don't blame me when little Eric jumps off of the terrace
You shoulda been watchin' him, apparently you ain't parents

So who's bringin' the guns in this country?
I couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun
Through customs over in London
And last week I seen this Schwarzenegger movie
Where he's shootin' all sorts of these motherfuckers with an Uzi
I see these three little kids up in the front row
Screaming ""Go!"" with their 17-year-old uncle
I'm like, guidance?!
Ain't they got the same moms and dads
Who got mad when I asked if they liked violence?
And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear?
What about the make-up
You allow your 12-year-old daughter to wear?
So tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words
When his bus driver's screamin' at him, fuckin' him up worse
(Go sit the fuck down, you little fucking prick!)
And ""fuck"" was the first word I ever learned
Up in the third grade, flippin' the gym teacher the bird (Look!)
So read up 'bout how I used to get beat up
Peed on, be on free lunch
And changed school every three months
My life's like kind of what my wife's like (What?)
Fucked up after I beat her fuckin' ass every night: Ike
So how much easier would life be
If nineteen million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?

I don't got that bad of a mouth, do I?
Fuck! Shit! Ass! Bitch! Cunt! Shooby-de-doo-wop! (Oops)
Skibbedy-be-bop, a Christopher Reeves
Sonny Bono, skis, horses and hittin' some trees (Hey)
How many retards'll listen to me
And run up in the school shootin' when they're pissed at a tea
-cher? Her? Him? Is it you? Is it them?
""Wasn't me, Slim Shady said to do it again!""
Damn, how much damage can you do with a pen?
Man, I'm just as fucked up as you woulda been
If you woulda been in my shoes, who woulda thought
Slim Shady would be somethin' that you woulda bought?
That woulda made you get a gun and shoot at a cop
I just said it, I ain't know if you'd do it or not

Do you know what you started?

47,Don't Blink,"[Verse 1]
I turned on the evening news
Saw a old man being interviewed
Turning a hundred and two today
Asked him what's the secret to life
He looked up from his old pipe
Laughed and said ""All I can say is.""

[Chorus]
Don't blink
Just like that you're six years old and you take a nap and you
Wake up and you're twenty-five and your high school sweetheart becomes your wife
Don't blink
You just might miss your babies growing like mine did
Turning into moms and dads next thing you know your better half
Of fifty years is there in bed
And you're praying God takes you instead
Trust me friend a hundred years goes faster than you think
So don't blink

[Verse 2]
I was glued to my TV when it looked like he looked at me and said
""Best start putting first things first.""
'Cause when your hourglass runs out of sand
You can't flip it over and start again
Take every breathe God gives you for what it's worth

[Chorus]
Don't blink
Just like that you're six years old and you take a nap and you
Wake up and you're twenty-five and your high school sweetheart becomes your wife
Don't blink
You just might miss your babies growing like mine did
Turning into moms and dads next thing you know your better half
Of fifty years is there in bed
And you're praying God takes you instead
Trust me friend a hundred years goes faster than you think
So don't blink

[Bridge]
So I've been tryna slow it down
I've been tryna take it in
In this here today gone tomorrow world we're livin' in

[Chorus]
Don't blink
Just like that you're six years old and you take a nap and you
Wake up and you're twenty-five and your high school sweetheart becomes your wife
Don't blink
You just might miss your babies growing like mine did
Turning into moms and dads next thing you know your better half
Of fifty years is there in bed
And you're praying God takes you instead
Trust me friend a hundred years goes faster than you think
So don't blink

Ora puoi pure piangere se non ci sentiamo
Ora non mi dispiace se non mi cercherai, ehi
Resti nel locale col telefono in mano
Sperando in un messaggio che non arriva mai
Sono una rockstar, rockstar
A uccidermi, no, non sarà una stronza, ehi
Il mio cuore è freddo, anche più del mio polso
E se provi a scaldarlo rischi che si sciolga
Pusher sul mio iPhone, pute sul mio iPad
Mamma guarda, senza mani, sono una rockstar
Mamma sai che a parte te non amo nessun'altra
Non esco più di tre volte con una ragazza
Non innamorarti mai di me
Non potrò mai essere il tuo boyfriend, no
Fumo dentro la stanza d'hotel
Chiamano dalla reception
C'era un ragazzo che come me
Amava i Beatles e i Rolling Stones
Metteva kush nelle Rolling Papers
E lo sciroppo nel biberon

Ok, ok, sto correndo troppo
Con lei due minuti e poi si arriva al dunque
Ho un bacio sul collo ma non è un tattoo
La mia ex ragazza vuol farmi il voodoo
La mia nuova tipa sembra Sailor Moon
Sogno il posteriore su una BMW
Ehi, ehi, uh, uh
La differenza tra me e te
Che-che tu-tu non sarai mai come me, eh
Con questi rapper io ci faccio un frappè, eh eh
Non ho ancora sentito dire: ""Grazie""

Just to think about it, I would do things that I would regret (tryna get you to)
To understand how I felt for you
I tried real hard time and time again
But I didn't know
My love wouldn't grow, I should've just let it go
But I stayed around thinking you would learn to love

[Hook: Keyshia Cole]
And we both knew, you're wrong
There's nothing you can do, to ever undo what you've done to me
I loved you, deep in my heart I know you couldn't love me
But baby I just kept holding on, I should've let you go
Should've let you go
Should've let you go
Should've let you go

[Verse 1: Keyshia Cole]
Couldn't do without it, I felt I needed you in my world (to get me by, by)
More and more I looked out for you, tried to play me like a fool so I
Didn't care that love wasn't there, had to just let it go
Couldn't stay around, thinking you would learn to love

[Hook: Keyshia Cole]

[Verse 2: Amina]
And now I'm gone, plus I'd rather be alone
We both grown, lower your tone over the phone, aaight
I should've known, damn I should've known
It wouldn't last long, when you didn't come home some nights
And now I'm on, in the zone, handle business on my own
So respect the queen on the throne, aaight
Here's some strong advice, move on, that's life
You're wrong, I'm right, and I'm glad I let you go

[Hook: Keyshia Cole]

But I should've let you
Don't know why I could never let you go

55,How 'Bout Them Cowgirls,"[Verse 1]
I felt the rush of the Rio Grande
Into Yellowstone and I've seen first-hand
Niagra Falls and the lights of Vegas
I've criss-crossed down to Key Biscayane
And Chi-town via Bangor, Maine
Think I've seen it all, and all I can say is

[Chorus]
How 'bout them cowgirls?
Boys, ain't they something?
Sure are some proud girls
And you can't tell them nothing
And I tell you right now, girls
May just be seven wonders
Of this big, old round world
But how 'bout them cowgirls?

[Verse 2]
She's a-ridin' colts in Steamboat Springs
Bailing hay outside Abilene
She's trying hard to fit in in some city
But her home is 'neath that big, blue sky
And the Northern Plains and those other wide
Open spaces, nowadays, there ain't as many

[Chorus]
How 'bout them cowgirls?
Boys, ain't they something?
Sure are some proud girls
And you can't tell them nothing
And I tell you right now, girls
May just be seven wonders
Of this big, old round world
But how 'bout them cowgirls?

[Bridge]
Boy, she don't need you and she don't need me
She can do just fine on her own two feet
But she wants a man who wants her to be herself
And she'll never change, don't know how to hide
Her stubborn will or her fighting side
But you treat her right and she'll love you like no one else

[Chorus]
Yeah, how 'bout them cowgirls?
Boys, ain't they something?
Sure are some proud girls
But you can't beat their loving
And I tell you right now, girls
May just be seven wonders

56,So Small,"[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
What you got if you ain't got love?
The kind that you just wanna give away
It's okay to open up
Go ahead and let the light shine through
I know it's hard on a rainy day
You wanna shut the world out and just be left alone
But don't run out on your faith

[Chorus]
'Cause sometimes that mountain you've been climbing is just a grain of sand
And what you've been up there searching for forever is in your hands
When you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else seem so small

[Verse 2]
It's so easy to get lost inside
A problem that seems so big at the time
It's like a river that's so wide
It swallows you whole
While you're sitting 'round thinking 'bout what you can't change
And worrying about all the wrong things
Time's flying by
Moving so fast
You better make it count 'cause you can't get it back

[Chorus]
Sometimes that mountain you've been climbing is just a grain of sand
And what you've been up there searching for forever is in your hands
Oh, and when you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else
Seem so small
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus 2]
Sometimes that mountain you've been climbing is just a grain of sand
And what you've been up there searching for forever is in your hands

And she needs to give 'em a shot
Whatever they are

Looks like she's all ready to leave
Nothing left to pack
There ain't no room for me in that car
Even if she asked me to tag along
God I gotta be strong

[Chorus]
She's at the starting line of the rest of her life
As ready as she's ever been
Got the hunger and the stars in her eyes
The prize is hers to win
She's waiting on my blessings
Before she hits that open road
Baby, get ready
Get set
Don't go

[Verse 3]
She says things are fallen into place
Feels like they're fallen apart
I painted this big old smile on my face
To hide my broken heart
If only she knew
This is where I don't say what I want so bad to say
This is where I want to but I won't get in the way
Of her and her dreams
And spreading her wings

[Verse 1]
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Verse 2]
I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?

Keep you in the dark
You know they all pretend
Keep you in the dark
And so it all began

[Verse 1]
Send in your skeletons
Sing as their bones go marching in again
They need you buried deep
The secrets that you keep are at the ready
Are you ready?
I'm finished making sense
Done pleading ignorance, that whole defense
Spinning infinity, boy
The wheel is spinning me

And I don't think that that's a selfish want, I really don't. I'm not saying that I have this capacity because it's hard to develop that capacity on your own, when you're being stopped at every turn

Drive around, night time, nowhere to go
Melt me down, I'm like wax to your jokes
Lost and found, knocking heads, laying low
And there's no point reliving crimes to lose this

Then restore the color back to the grey

61,What Do Ya Think About That,"I heard it through the grapevine
My new neighbor don't like my big red barn
A '47 Ford, bullet holes in the door
Broke down motor in the front yard
I got half a mind to paint a plywood sign
And nail it up on a knotty pine tree
Saying I was here first
This is my piece of dirt
And your rambling don't rattle me

Some people care about what other people think
Worry about what they say
Let a little gossip
Coming from a loose lip ruin a perfect day
Saying blah, blah, blah, just a jacking their jaws
Gotta let it roll off-a my back
I don't give a dern what other people think
What do ya think about that

I wear what I want to, overalls, work boots
Crank my music up loud
Like to sling a little mud in my four wheel drive
Trek it all into town

Shot a little eight ball down at the pool hall
Drink a beer with my friends
Now don't judge me and I won't judge you
Cause we all get judged in the end

Some people care about what other people think
Worry about what they say
Let a little gossip
Coming from a loose lip ruin a perfect day
Saying blah, blah, blah, just a jacking their jaws
Gotta let it roll off-a my back
I don't give a dern what other people think
What do ya think about that

Some people care about what other people think

62,If I Had Eyes,"[Verse 1]
If I had eyes in the back of my head
I would have told you that
You looked good
As I walked away

If you could have tried to trust the hand that fed
You would've never been hungry
But you never really be

The more of this or less of this or is there any difference
Or are we just holding onto the things we don't have anymore

[Chorus]
Sometimes time doesn't heal
No, not at all
Just stand still
While we fall
In or out of love again I doubt I'm going to win you back
When you got eyes like that
It won't let me in
Always looking out

[Backing vocals and claps]

[Verse 2]
Lot of people spend their time just floating
We were victims together but lonely
You got hungry eyes that just can't look forward
Can't give them enough but we just can't start over

Building with bent nails we're
Falling but holding, I don't want to take up anymore of your time
Time, time, time

[Chorus]
Sometimes time doesn't heal
No, not at all
Just stand still
While we fall
In or out of love again I doubt I'm going to win you back
When you got eyes like that
It won't let me in
Always looking out

64,Letter To Me,"[Verse 1]
If I could write a letter to me
And send it back in time to myself at seventeen
First I'd prove it's me by sayin' look under your bed
There's a Skoal can and a Playboy no one else would know you hid
And then I'd say I know it's tough
When you break up after seven months
And yeah, I know you really liked her and it just don't seem fair
But all I can say is pain like that is fast and it's rare

[Chorus]
And, oh, you've got so much goin' for you, goin' right
But I know at seventeen it's hard to see past Friday night
She wasn't right for you and still you feel like there's a knife
Stickin' out of your back and you're wonderin' if you'll survive
But you'll make it through this and you'll see
You're still around to write this letter to me

[Verse 2]
At the stop sign at Tomlinson and Eighth
Always stop completely, don't just tap your brakes
And when you get a date with Bridgett, make sure the tank is full
On second thought forget it, that one turns out kinda cool
Each and every time you have a fight
Just assume you're wrong and dad is right
And you should really thank Mrs. Brinkman, she spends so much extra time
It's like she sees the diamond underneath and she's polishing you 'til you shine

[Chorus 2]
And, oh, you've got so much goin' for you, goin' right
But I know at seventeen it's hard to see past Friday night
Tonight's the bonfire rally but you're stayin' home instead
Because if you fail Algebra, mom and dad will kill you dead
Trust me you'll squeak by and get a C
And you're still around to write this letter to me

[Verse 3]
You've got so much up ahead, you'll make new friends
You should see your kids and wife
And I'd end up sayin' have no fear
These are nowhere near the best years of your life

[Bridge]
I guess I'll see you in the mirror, when you're a grown man
P.S.: Go hug Aunt Rita every chance you can

[Chorus]
And, oh, you've got so much goin' for you, goin' right
But I know at seventeen it's hard to see past Friday night
I wish you'd study Spanish, I wish you'd taken typin' class
I wish you wouldn't worry, let it be, hey I'd say have a little faith and you'll see

When I see you out, when I hear about {T-Pain}

Baby Screwed Up so you better be from Tex-as
Can't seem to doubt that I creamed her out
Now you dream about how I turned Nieman out
Nothin to scream about just back your Bimmer out
Pack it up in the trunk, go back to key my house
Cause I can play cool, but I can't play fool
There's options in break up, you ever play pool?
Better do you cause I damn sure does me
And what your buzz be is only because of me
The wifey, hus-by, never was me
I does me, trust me

Have me talkin crazy, it's time to come on home
Now, I talk with someone above
It's okay to lose your pride over someone you love
Don't lose someone you love though over your pride
Stick wit'cha entree and get over your side
We break up to make up at Jacob's baby
Her parents fought too, I'm the makeup baby
Wake up baby, love'll have you open though

So I just can't bet on the next hand
There's too much in this pot just to give to the next man

Now if you ain't never went through it you ain't really into it
The next rap to show you I really been through it
Every other day I'm givin the love away
That's what your friend's sister or little brother say
If I'mma do somethin, it's the undercover way
When them hatin ass watchdogs look the other way
And others may not see that we need each other
But if we on the same page we can read each other
They should learn us, instead of try to turn us
Mr. and Ms. Smith, we both got the burners - UP~!
If you love your baby then turn this up
Know we keep this hot like a Thermos cup
Relax, don't be tryin to perm us up

I'ma show 'em how to act

Okay now picture little Bobby just a youngin' runnin' round
With his mans, hammer in his hands, feelin' like the man
Run, mothafucka, run
Before the popo get the gun, put it to your brain like goddamn!
Everybody know you ain't about it
Everything you talk about I know I can live without it
Red light, stop. Green light, go!
Everything ain't what it seem like
Mothafucka I know!
Hold up, what you mean, where you been?
Bitch, I been in
This is merely the beginning again
What you been living in?
A box, under the bridge, like Anthony Kiedis?
Looking for something to complete us
And maybe lead us, fuck an elitist
Hell of a long way from equal is how they treat us
Body of a builder with the mind of a fetus
Turn on the television and see the vision they feed us
And I wish I could erase that, face facts

God as my witness, I'm with this
But on the real, I think I need another witness!
If it was 1717, black daddy, white momma wouldn't change a thing

Well I'll be God damned, go figure
In my blood is the slave and the master
It's like the devil playin' spades with the pastor
But he was born with the white privilege!
Man, what the fuck is that?
White people told me as a child, as a little boy, playin' with his toys
I should be ashamed to be black
And some black people look ashamed when I rap
Like my great granddaddy didn’t take a whip to the back
Not accepted by the black or the white

Take off and fly
Tryin to figure out which one you might be on
And why you dont love me anymore
Right now im sittin' out here watching airplanes

I would've lied could've cried should've tried harder
Done anything to make you stay
I wonder what you'd do if you looked out your window
Saw me runnin down the runway just like i was crazy
That fence is too high so am I

So I'm just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Take off and fly
Tryin to figure out which one you might be on
And why you don't love me anymore
By now I know you're thirty thousand feet above me
But a million miles away, a million miles away
By now I know I outta act like you don't love me

But im just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Take off and fly

Trying to cash his microphone check, 2-1-2
Wanna believe my own hype, but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees, what have you brung? You?
Did you improve on the design, did you do something new?
Well, your name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?
You! The more famous person you come through
And the sexy lady next to you—you come too
And then it hit me—standing outside of Heaven
Waiting for God to come and get me: I'm too uncouth
Unschooled to the rules and too gumshoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool

Unstrap him from the chair, and put him back in his cage...-uh

'Cause I've been standing in this line for, like, five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along
And when I got to the front
They told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&Ms are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every song's her favorite song; and mics don't feedback
All the reviewers say, ""You need to go and see that""
And everybody claps, 'cause everybody is pleased
And then, they all take the stage and start performing for me

77,See You Again,"[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (See you in a better place)

How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)

Aah oh, aah oh
Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
(Remember me when I'm gone)

[Refrain: Wiz Khalifa]
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again

It's too late baby, there's no turning around
I got my hands in my pocket and my head in a cloud
This is how I do, when I think about you
I never thought that you could break me apart
I keep a sinister smile and a hole in my heart
You want to get inside, then you can get in line
But not this time

'Cause you caught me off guard
Now I'm running and screaming
I feel like a hero and you are my heroine

[Verse 2]
I won't try to philosophize
I'll just take a deep breath then I'll look in your eyes
This is how I feel, and it's so surreal
I got a closet filled up to the brim
With the ghosts of my past and their skeletons
And I don't know why
You'd even try
But I won't lie

[Chorus]
You caught me off guard
Now I'm running and screaming
I feel like a hero and you are my heroine
Do you know that your love is the sweetest sin?

[Verse 3]
And I feel a weakness coming on
It never felt so good to be so wrong
Had my heart on lockdown
And then you turned me around
And I'm feeling like a newborn child
Every time I get a chance to see you smile
It's not complicated
I was so jaded

Stay one hundred to the grave, ain't gon' never change
Shout out to my mama, put her through so much pain
I remember all them shootouts that we had with them other niggas
My bitch got mad and fucked another nigga
Man that shit was crazy, ain't gon' lie it made me heartless
Fell in love with money, it's gon' stay with me regardless

81,Bleed It Out,"[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, here we go for the hundredth time
Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw 'em up and let something shine
Going out of my fucking mind

Filthy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose

Truth is, you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug the trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach, somewhere

Yeah, someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor, again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

[Chorus: Chester Bennington with Mike Shinoda]
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Go, stop the show
Choppy words and a sloppy flow
Shotgun opera, lock and load
Cock it back and then watch it go

Mama, help me, I've been cursed
Death is rolling in every verse
Candy paint on his brand new hearse
Can't contain him, he knows he works

Fuck, this hurts, I won't lie
Doesn't matter how hard I try
Half the words don't mean a thing
And I know that I won't be satisfied

So why try ignoring him?
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away

I've opened up these scars
I'll make you face this
I've pulled myself so far
I'll make you face this now

[Verse 1]
I've been looking so long at these pictures of you
That I almost believe that they're real
I've been living so long with my pictures of you
That I almost believe that the pictures are
All I can feel

[Verse 2]
Remembering you
Standing quiet in the rain
As I ran to your heart to be near
And we kissed as the sky fell in
Holding you close
How I always held close in your fear
Remembering you
Running soft through the night
You were bigger and brighter and wider than snow
And screamed at the make-believe
Screamed at the sky
And you finally found all your courage
To let it all go

[Verse 3]
Remembering you
Fallen into my arms
Crying for the death of your heart
You were stone white
So delicate
Lost in the cold
You were always so lost in the dark
Remembering you
How you used to be
Slow drowned
You were angels
So much more than everything
Hold for the last time then slip away quietly
Open my eyes
But I never see anything

[Bridge]
If only I'd thought of the right words
I could have held on to your heart
If only I'd thought of the right words
I wouldn't be breaking apart
All my pictures of you

[Verse 4]
Looking so long at these pictures of you
But I never hold on to your heart
Looking so long for the words to be true
But always just breaking apart
My pictures of you

There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more
Than to feel you deep in my heart
There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more
Than to never feel the breaking apart

83,Won't Go Home Without You,"[Verse 1]
I asked her to stay, but she wouldn't listen
And she left before I had the chance to say
Oh, oh
Words that would mend the things that were broken
But now it's far too late; she's gone away

[Pre-Chorus]
Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking, ""Why does this happen to me?
Why does every moment have to be so hard?""
Hard to believe that

[Chorus]
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you

[Verse 2]
The taste of her breath, I'll never get over
The noises that she made, kept me awake
Oh
The weight of things that remained unspoken
Built up so much it crushed us every day

[Pre-Chorus]
Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking, ""Why does this happen to me?
Why does every moment have to be so hard?""
Hard to believe that

It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Of all the things I felt but never really showed
Perhaps the worst is that I ever let you go
I should not ever let you go
Oh, oh, oh, oh

It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you

Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night

Hung my cotton dress on rusted wire
Up there on Pilahatchee Bridge

Jumped head-first into the water
Baptized away my sins

Couple of lookers, new best friends
We slipped in the back of Sunday service
Know them church ladies, they heard us
Bum smoke money from the offering

That Slim-Jim bag boy hadn't a prayer
Well, I hiked my skirt and did the talkin'
While them boys were busy walkin'
Case of .5 out the back door
Hid deep in the Mississippi backwoods
We danced and played around 'til dark
Well, I had them wrestlin' for my first kiss
Turned into a fight and they missed
Me speedin' off in Tommy's car

87,The Way I Am,"[Segue from ""Steve Berman (Skit)""]
...Man, whatever

[Intro]
Dre, just let it run
Ayo, turn the beat up a little bit
Ayo
This song is for anyone...
Fuck it, just shut up and listen
Ayo

[Verse 1]
I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zag's and this bag
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this... on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension, dispensin' these sentences
Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off
Of this chest and I rest again peacefully (Peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
To not come and speak to me (Speak to me), I don't know you
And no, I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me, my tank is on empty (Is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you ten feet (Liftin' you ten feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you (Of all you), I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be, it's just me

[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content
The song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses.""
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (Finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn (On Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at!
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city
Havin' this happenin' (This happenin') then attack
Eminem 'cause I rap this way (Rap this way) but I'm glad
'Cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire to burn
And it's burnin', and I have returned

[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 3]
I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top a ""My Name Is""
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (Got the patience)
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
Who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause I talk
With an accent and grab on my balls so they always
Keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (Fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (Drivin' me crazy), I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without
Someone standin' by it! (Standin' by it) No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

[Chorus]
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

89,More Than A Memory,"(Intro Chorus)
Your more than a memory, i am sure you'll remember me
I can hear you call when you mention me
I know we dont talk but ill get to you eventually
You'll never know what you meant to me, your more than..
I am sure...
And i can you call...
I know we dont talk..
You'll never know what you meant to me, your more than a memory

(Verse 1)
Yo, lets take a trip down memory lane
Try to envision re-livin' everyday
Before your biggest mistake only milliseconds away
Tell me what would you try to change
Would you leave it the same or do you see a different way
Are you dying for grace, do you live with a dying rage
Fuck, if i could trade my place i'd be a star in outer space
Gravitate towards harmony, far away from all the hate
Somewhere i can concentrate, im out of patience
I lie awake, my minds racing
Im lucky i ain't crazy but if i go insane then fuckin' annihilate me
Cuz when i break these breaks theres no way your gonna cage me
Everything isnt what it may seem, i paint this picture while i day dream
Such a vivid imagination reminiscin' bout the days we-
Would still make believe, take me away..

(Chorus)(2x)
Your more than a memory, i am sure you'll remember me
I can hear you call when you mention me
I know we dont talk but ill get to you eventually
You'll never know what you meant to me, your more than a memory

(Verse 2)
Do you remember when you said to me
That i can make it, well im makin' up a recipe-
For greatness, made of whatever is left of me
Im chasin dreams, tryna figure out my destiny
Im running out of time, i know im gonna die eventually
An when i leave i hope that they atleast-
Can be respectful when they mention me
Im thinkin about all the time in hell that god will sentence me-
When we meet, i try not to let it get to me
I gotta learn to live and let it be, no point in questioning-
The things that weren't meant to be, the truth is unsettling
Im second guessing everything, experimented with music an let it get the best of me
Im stressing if this is something that i should keep progressing with
Is there a chance that this can ever work to my benefit, will i end up regretting it
Fuck it, i got a message if anybody is listening thats enough
Cuz i cherish it every second it i get it, and-

(Chorus)(2x)
Your more than a memory, i am sure you'll remember me
I can hear you call when you mention me

Teary eyed as you took my hand and I told you that I'd be your man
So many things have come so many things have gone
One thing that's stayed the same is our love is still growing strong

{Chorus}
Baby just look at us all this time and we're still in love
Something like this just don't exist
Between a backwoods boy and a fairy tale princess
People said it would never work out
Living our dreams has shattered all doubts
It feels good to prove 'em wrong
Living our love song

Oh darling would you look at me
With my heart beating fast and my shaking knees
It's pretty hard to believe after all these years I still need you this badly
You're dancing in my arms with a spotlight moon in a sea of stars
Girl we've come so far everything I want is everything that you are
I just want to lay you down
Say I love you without a sound

But to him I'm just some fellow

I leaned in towards those pictures
To get a better look at one

""Now, ain't she somethin son?""

And I realized that in his eyes she would always be

Text her phone a million times, but she ain’t trying to hear it
Tattoos and piercings, Gucci shoes for chirren
Kids just as fresh as she be, She serious
All I do is ball, and all she fuck is winners
Take her to the mall, she don’t want to go to dinner

Money in my bank account, pockets hella swollen
And a model girlfriend, so for them cameras we be posing

Got a weed connect from Tennessee to California
Twenty grand in Pari, blowing on that Mary
Your bitch on my Johnson cause I’m balling like I’m Larry
And I play my part
I’m out here with them bosses, and she notice from the start
Get thirty K to show, so we both be going hard

Ever slow, she’ll up the speed
Cause she a go girl

Go girl, go girl
My new bitch, your old girl
She bust it open for my like a showgirl
Call me king, then tell me that it’s your world
Body Jamaican, but the vagina is Asian

And if I throw it back at her, then she probably gonna chase it
Because she’s a go girl

For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool
When I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you
But I never showed

But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better

I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more
Than worth its weight in gold

I only keep myself this sick in the head 'cause I know how the words get you (off)

[Pre-Chorus]
We're the new face of failure
Prettier and younger but not any better off
Bulletproof loneliness at best, at best

[Chorus]
Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you
Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you

[Verse 2]
Collect the bad habits that you couldn't bear to keep
Out of the woods but I love
The tree I used to lay beneath, kissed teeth stained red
From a sour bottle baby girl with eyes the size of baby worlds

[Pre-Chorus]
We're the new face of failure
Prettier and younger but not any better off
Bulletproof loneliness at best, at best

[Chorus]
Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you
Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you
Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you
Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you

[Bridge]
The best way to make it through with hearts and wrists intact
Is to realize two out of three ain't bad, ain't bad

[Chorus]
Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you
Me and you, honeymoon
Setting in a honeymoon
Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you
Me and you, setting in a honeymoon

No clouds in my stones
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank
Coming down with the Dow Jones
When the clouds come, we gone, we Roc-A-Fella
We fly higher than weather, in G5's or better

You have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart

But you'll still be my star
Baby, ‘cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share
Because

[Chorus: Rihanna]
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end

When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart
Because

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end

Hey there Delilah

Yes, you do
Times Square can't shine as bright as you
I swear it's true
Hey there Delilah
Don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely
Give this song another listen
Close your eyes
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise
I'm by your side

Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
What you do to me

Hey there Delilah
I know times are getting hard
But just believe me, girl
Someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar
We'll have it good
We'll have the life we knew we would
My word is good
Hey there Delilah
I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you
Would take your breath away
I'd write it all
Even more in love with me, you'd fall
We'd have it all

[Chorus]
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me

[Bridge]
A thousand miles seems pretty far
But they've got planes and trains and cars
I'd walk to you if I had no other way
Our friends would all make fun of us
And we'll just laugh along because we know
That none of them have felt this way
Delilah, I can promise you
That by the time we get through
The world will never ever be the same
And you're to blame

[Verse 3]
Hey there Delilah
You be good and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school
And I'll be making history like I do
You'll know it's all because of you
We can do whatever we want to
Hey there Delilah here's to you
This one's for you

Holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees

So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

[Verse 2]
From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away

So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

[Bridge]
Tryna fit your hand inside of mine
When we know it just don't belong
'Cause no force on earth could make it feel right, no, no
Tryna push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
I think now's the time to let it slide

So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze

115,"Sorry, Blame It On Me","[Intro]
As life goes on
I'm starting to learn more and more about responsibility
And I realize that everything I do
Is affecting the people around me
So I wanted to take this time out
To apologize for things that I've done
And things that haven't occured yet
And things that they don't want to take responsibility for

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry for the times that I left you home
I was on the road and you were alone
I'm sorry for the times that I had to go
I'm sorry for the fact that I did not know
That you were sitting home, just wishing we
Could go back to when it was just you and me
I'm sorry for the times I would neglect
I'm sorry for the times I disrespect
I'm sorry for the wrong things that I've done
I'm sorry I'm not always there for my sons
I'm sorry for the fact that I'm not aware
That you can't sleep at night when I am not there
Because I'm in the streets like every day
I'm sorry for the things that I did not say
Like how you are the best thing in my world
And how I'm so proud to call you my girl

[Hook]
I understand there are some problems
And I'm not too blind to know
All the pain you kept inside you
Even though you might not show
If I can apologize for being wrong
Then it's just a shame on me
I'll be the reason for your pain
And you can put the blame on me
You could put the blame on me
You could put the blame on me
You could put the blame on me
You could put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me
You could put the blame on me

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry for the things that he put you through
And all the times you didn't know what to do
I'm sorry that you had to go and sell those bags
Just tryin' to stay busy 'til you heard from Dad
When you would rather be home with all your kids
As one big family with love and bliss
And even though pops treated us like kings
He got a second wife and you didn't agree
He got up and left you there all alone
I'm sorry that you had to do it on your own
I'm sorry that I went and added to your grief
I'm sorry that your son was once a thief
I'm sorry that I grew up way too fast
I wish I would've listened and not be so bad
I'm sorry that your life turned out this way
I'm sorry that the feds came and took me away

[Hook]
I understand that there are some problems
And I'm not too blind to know
All the pain you kept inside you
Even though you might not show
If I can apologize for being wrong

You could put the blame on me

Said you could put the blame on me
Said you could put the blame on me

I'm sorry that it took so long to see
That they were dead wrong tryin' to put it on me
I'm sorry that it took so long to speak
But I was on tour with Gwen Stefani
I'm sorry for the hand that she was dealt
For the embarrassment that she felt
Just a little young girl tryin' to have fun
Her daddy should've never let her out that young
I'm sorry for Club Zen getting shut down
I hope they manage better next time around
How was I to know she was underage?
In a 21-and-older club they say
Why doesn't anybody wanna take blame?
Verizon backed out, disgracing my name
I'm just a singer tryin' to entertain
Because I love my fans I'll take that blame

Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you

121,Before He Cheats,"[Verse 1]
Right now, he's probably slow dancing
With a bleached-blond tramp
And she's probably getting frisky
Right now, he's probably buying her some fruity little drink
'Cause she can't shoot whiskey
Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool-stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know

[Chorus]
I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

[Verse 2]
Right now, she's probably up singing some
White-trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now, she's probably saying, ""I'm drunk""
And he's a thinking that he's gonna get lucky
Right now, he's probably dabbing on
Three dollars worth of that bathroom polo
Oh, and he don't know

[Chorus]
Oh, that I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

I might've saved a little trouble for the next girl
'Cause the next time that he cheats

Sometimes think the war is necessary
Every night I pray for peace on earth
And I hand down my dollars to the homeless
But believe that every able soul should work

My father gave me my shotgun
That I'll hand down to my son
Try to teach him everything it means

Call me wrong, call me right
But I bring my better angels to every fight
You may not like where I'm going
But you sure know where I stand
Hate me if you want to
Love me if you can

I stand by my right to speak freely
But I worry 'bout what kids learn from TV

125,Dreaming With A Broken Heart,"[Verse 1]
When you’re dreaming with a broken heart
The waking up is the hardest part
You roll out of bed and down on your knees
And for a moment, you can hardly breathe
Wondering, “Was she really here?
Is she standing in my room?”
No she’s not
‘Cause she’s gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

[Verse 2]
When you’re dreaming with a broken heart
The giving up is the hardest part
She takes you in, with her crying eyes
Then, all at once, you have to say goodbye
Wondering, “could you stay my love?
Will you wake up by my side?”
No she can’t
‘Cause she’s gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

Now, do I have to fall asleep with roses in my hand?
Do I have to fall asleep with roses in my hand?

I told God I'd be back in a second

Get arrested guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do? Act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry, more Louis V
My mama couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me

Class started 2 hours ago, oh am I late?
No, I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh they so sensitive
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon' end up apolog'ing

Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past
He don't even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors, he can drive off of fumes 'cause
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure, what's your pleasure?
Life is a, UH, depending how you dress her
So if the Devil wear Prada, Adam Eve wear nada
I'm in between but way more fresher
With way less effort, 'cause when you try hard
That's when you die hard

And make peace with an empty town
We can make it right

We'll make the great escape
And we won't hear a word they say

Watch it burn
Let it die
'Cause we are finally free tonight

Tonight will change our lives
It's so good to be by your side, but we'll cry
We won't give up the fight
We'll scream loud at the top of our lungs

And we'll feel so alive

Couldn't wait to turn 16 and drive all the boys around
Foot on the gas and hands on the wheel was all I could think about
A little rust in the bed of that truck and a four speed on the floor
Five-hundred dollars it was mine, all mine and I never wanted nothing more

[Verse 2]
I took Katie down by the river with a six dollar bottle of wine
Just a fool trying' to play it cool hoping' she'd let me cross the line
I was praying that she couldn't tell I never been that far before
The first time's a one time feeling and I never wanted nothing more
No I never wanted nothing more..

I'm sure happy with what I've got
I live to love and laugh a lot
And that's all I need

[Verse 3]
My buddies all tried to change my mind
But I told them that I'd thought it through
Katie laughed and my mama cried when they heard me say ""I do""
Her little ring is a little thing, but its all I could afford
Now she's mine, all mine till the day I die, and I never wanted nothing more

[Chorus]
Well I'm what I am and I'm what I'm not
I'm sure happy with what I've got
I live to love and laugh a lot

One Sunday I listened to the preacher and I knew he was preaching to me
I couldn't help it I walked up front and I got down on my knees
Right then and there, I swear I changed when I found the Lord
Glory Hallelujah, good God almighty I never wanted nothing more

C'mon! (Woooo!)

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Yeah, so what if you flip a couple words?
I could triple that in birds
Open your mind, you see the circus in the sky
I'm Ringling Brothers, Barnum & Bailey with the pies
No matter how you slice it, I'm your motherfuckin' guy
And just like a b-boy with 360 waves
Do the same with the pot, still come back beige
Whether right or southpaw, whether pot or the jar
Whip it around, it still comes back hard
So easily do I W-H-I-P
My repetition with wristses'll bring the kilo bidness
I got Creole C.O. bitches for my niggas
Who slipped, became prisoners, trees taped to the visitors
You already know what the bidness is
Unnecessary commissary, boy, we live this shit
Niggas wanna bring the 80s back
That's okay with me, that's where they made me at
Except I don't write on the wall
I write my name in the history books, hustlin' in the hall
Nah, I don't spin on my head
I spin my work in the pot, so I can spend my bread

Cherry M3's with the top back (top back)
Red and green G's all on my hat
North Beach leathers, matching Gucci sweater
Gucci sneaks on to keep my outfit together
Whatever, hundred for the diamond chain

Blame Reagan for making me into a monster
Blame Oliver North and Iran-Contra
I ran contraband that they sponsored
Before this rhymin' stuff we was in concert

Try as they may, they couldn't get me on the hook, uhh

Then I became a daddy; you became a mother
Was an uphill battle nearly every day
Looking back I wouldn't have it any other way

Still working our way through the land of milk and honey

You looked mad enough to fight

Well, that's another side of you
That I'm in a love with too
Yeah, that minivan's a far cry
From the sports car in your dreams
And that dead end job is pushing back
Vacation more, it seems
You got soccer at four-thirty
And ballet class by five
Then I call you talking flirty
You ask have I lost my mind

Well, that's another side of you
That I'm in love with too

When you lay down in my arms
Let go of all that stress
Whisper, honey I love you
With your head on my chest
When the world's strongest woman is my lady
When the day is through
Well, that's another side of you
That I'm in love with too

If I had to do the things you do
Well, I'd just lose my mind
Somehow you get 'em fed and bathed
And settled down by nine
And I hear you down the hallway
As you're laying down to sleep
And pray the good lord watches
Over them and you and me

Woke up in my rocking chair
Holding a beer in my hand

Ain't got a clue what went down
So I started calling around

144,Potential Breakup Song,"[Verse 1: Aly]
It took too long, it took too long
It took too long for you to call back
And normally, I would just forget that
Except for the fact it was my birthday
My stupid birthday

I played along, rolled right off my back
But obviously my armor was cracked
What kind of a boyfriend would forget that?
Who would forget that?

[Pre-Chorus 1: Aly & AJ]

What he has until she leaves

Dancing on the floor
And with cold steel, odour on their bodies
Made a move to connect
But I could only stare in disbelief
As the crowds all left

Where we majored in beer and girls
It was all real funny 'til we ran out of money

Till we make it to a Friday night
And it's church league softball, holler 'bout a bad call

And the beers are pourin' till Monday mornin'

You that nigga on the low-low
You're the nigga, you're the one that be talkin' to the po-pos
Porsche sittin' on Forgi's
Niggas can't afford these
The Panamera shittin' on the 9-11

We turnt up in the studio late night
That's why the songs that you hear are comin' real tight
OVO crew, nigga, thought I told you
If you a player in the game, this should hold you
And man shout my nigga Game he just rolled through
Eatin' crab out in Malibu at Nobu
A lot of fools puttin' salt in the game
Until these women get the notion that they runnin' the game
They got money that they jumpin' on the pole to make
Did the motto, took a flight to the golden state
I'm the general, just makin' sure my soldiers straight
Had to leave my nigga, homie got an open case
But I'm big on the west like I'm big in the south
So we gon' pay some people off, we gon' figure it out
And my name too big, and my gang too big
Young Money shit, me and Lil Wayne too big
I'ma crush that ass even if it ain't too big
I would pinky swear but my pinky ring too big

50 Cent
Ciara
I'm focused, man
You should know this, man

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Yes, one dose of me will have you addicted
To know me is to love me; I handle my business
Any city any town - touch down; I do my thing
I'm a hustler, baby, I provide by any means
I'm a great conversationist, you should know what I'm about
When you look at me baby you should see a way out
Out the hood, out the drama, out the Bentley that's on
Out the headache an stress you done been through before

[Verse 2: Ciara]
It's only been three months and I already got it bad
So hood that I keep on coming back
My girlfriend's telling me I don't know how to act
But I'm telling them, ""Baby, bye, fall back""
He's so good and he knows how to love me
But so hood and he's so heavy in the streets
He's my dude and you better get used to things
And I don't care what you say about me
They say

[Pre-Chorus: Ciara]
That he does it with the best, runs it in the west
Tatted on his chest (Uh-huh)
I like it (So what?), I like it
And they say (That he's gonna hurt me)
Just wait and see (But they don't know me)
'Cause I am what he wants his girl and I love it

[Chorus: Ciara]
I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that good boy game, but the dope boy's turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone
I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that game, but the dope boy's turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone

[Verse 2: Ciara]
So when I had a good guy, he didn't do that much for me
Tried to be hard, but that he could never be
Always tell me that no one could compare to me
But couldn't handle it when other guy was staring at me
Now the top lays back so everyone could look at me
From the A to hill up in Beverly
He's so fly that he knows how to carry me
First class when they talk, we don't hear what they say

[Pre-Chorus: Ciara]
That he does it with the best, runs it in the west
Tatted on his chest (Uh-huh)
I like it (So what?), I like it
And they say (That he's gonna hurt me)
Just wait and see (But they don't know me)
'Cause I am what he wants his girl and I love it

[Chorus: Ciara]
I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that good boy game, but the dope boy's turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone
I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that game, but the dope boy's turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
The more I get, the more my ambition; tell me there's more
I'll move an eighth for that girl; I'll move a half for that boy
Then I flip that (Double up) kick back (Cuddle up)
Your friends try to confuse but you know what
My intentions are good, I can't help it I'm hood
I wouldn't change if I could, you shouldn't tell me I should
Baby ,you should take me as I am
An be happy you're my girl 'cause I'm happy I'm your man

[Bridge: Ciara]
If he gets caught, it just takes one call
I'll come running
Boy, I promise I will be there for you
All my heart, it belongs to you
I can't lose you, boy, I just can't leave you alone

[Chorus: Ciara]
I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that good boy game, but the dope boy's turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone
I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that game, but the dope boy's turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone
I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that good boy game, but the dope boy's turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone
I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that game, but the dope boy's turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone

157,Because Of You,"[Verse 1]
I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far

[Chorus 1]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you, I am afraid

[Verse 2]
I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with

[Chorus 1]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust
Not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid

[Bridge]
I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing

[Chorus 2]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I try my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid

Honey lookin' good from her head to her toe
Beauty overload, body out of control
She twenty-four, she could be a model
So beautiful, also natural
Mami lookin good from her head to her feet
She forty-four but she still lookin' sweet
And you can tell her daughter ain't even at her peak
'Cause her mama lookin' so hot packin' that heat
So be a good girl and thank your mama
She had you steamin' like a sauna

You better thank your mama 'cause girl you the one

1973
I'm feeding rolls of quarters in the pay television
And trying to make sense of today
Two missed connections in the Amtrak station
Still days away from my final destination
When I see the city lights
I'll know I'll made the finish line
My girl Lucy waits for me to bend my knee
But the diamond doesn't shine
And I can barely make the payments
On our telephone ring
I took a second job watching
The clock change hands
The seven's disappointed
And me I'm not committed to be a numbers man

Dear Mr. Charles Brown
I make the rent on time
It's true I'm undecided
And the season has expired
I'll never be the man she desires
Two missed connections in the Amtrak station
I walked out the door without delay or hesitation
Somebody shouted your name
And I swear they yelled fire
Charles, my best is not enough
Today I'm finally giving up
Oh, Lucy I love you
My plane isn't landing
They're telling me my phone is tapped

It's going down to the wire
I'm collecting the rain
I'll use it for payment

Lately
I been wantin' you back in my life
I know, I know
Been a while since we felt the vibe
But I know I know, I know I know
I know what you like

[Pre-Chorus]
Met you in the lobby, I was just arriving, you was checking out
Felt you staring at me and immediately I had no doubt
Missed your flight, we spent the week together but it's all over now
'Cause we tried to keep it going when we got home but our heads were in the clouds

[Chorus]
So I'm waiting for the sun to come up
Take me for a ride in your Beamer
Let's just roll the top down, ain't gon' stop
'Til the stars are above
Wish that you would talk to me
'Cause I don't really know just what to think
Got me now, runnin' round, looking for your love
Kinda makes me wonder
Why you playin' with me?
Kinda makes me wonder
Do you think of me?
Kinda makes me wonder

[Verse 2]
It's raining
Thought we'd never drift but I can't lie
We faded
Grass ain't always greener on the other side
I know, I know
I know that the cold world passes by
But I know I know, I know I know
I know what you like

[Pre-Chorus]
Met you in the lobby, I was just arriving, you was checking out

162,Big Things Poppin' (Do It),"[Dialogue: Ms. Watson]
Does love always develop like that?

[Verse 1: Abstract]
Come and step into my office
I'm the boss; it’s keys, drums, melodies fillin' up my wallet
Big things poppin', on my grind all the time
But you know I’m stompin' on a trick like Wallisch
Knew I had to do it for the small town kids
Livin' proof, livin' dreams, you can get it like this
They ain't gonna get it 'til the world do though
No motivation, like when I go home
I remember they were colder than December with the shoulder
Circle full of real friends, rest kicked boulders
Now they show me love, actin' like a shareholder
But you ain't invested in me, you never really believed
Started makin’ music when my heart got broke
Stabbed in the back before I could heal though
I’m reminded of the scars every time I go home
Heard my fame got to her, heard a bullet in the chamber
Heard she got some rumors on the move outta anger
They gon' say it’s petty, I revisit again
My reputation ain't complacent, I'm accustomed to vent
You can't assassinate my character, I know who I am
With the way we linkin’, they gon' John Wilkes Booth
Bigger that we get, the more that they'll yell, ""Shoot!""
But this here ain't a play, this my goddamn life
Here for a long time? Goddamn right
All I do is spit the truth and make my dreams come true
Honesty the policy, I thought you knew
This the last response that I'm ever gonna do
I would say fight fair, but fair was never you

[Chorus: Abstract]
My mother always told me, ""Careful who you keep around""
Guess I shoulda listened; guess I know now
When you up, when you up, they gon' try to shoot you down
When you up, when you up, they gon' try to shoot you down
My mother always told me ""Careful who you keep around""
Guess I shoulda listened; guess I know now
When you up, when you up, they gon' try to shoot you down
When you up, when you up, they gon' try to shoot you down

[Verse 2: Abstract]
Still livin' every second for the music
Kept me livin' back when I was 'bout to lose it
Went from, ""Watch me"" to ""Look, I really do this""
My 2012 tape soundin' better than your new shit
I've been goin' hard since the day I got a mic
Now I got a studio, it only feel right
Had a lotta dark days and a lotta long nights
But I'm finally on my way, gonna be a long flight
Tourin' overseas like I said I would
On that USB mic in the corner of my bedroom
Tell the flight attendant I been runnin', need the leg-room
Dreamt so long, not a second to be slept through
I don't do it for the cash, I just do it for the fans
'Cause they know if I could do it, anybody got a chance
I ain't talkin' 'bout the shit I do on the mic
Talkin' comin' out of a dark place becomin' the light

[Chorus: Abstract]
My mother always told me, ""Careful who you keep around""
Guess I shoulda listened; guess I know now
When you up, when you up, they gon' try to shoot you down
When you up, when you up, they gon' try to shoot you down
My mother always told me ""Careful who you keep around""
Guess I shoulda listened; guess I know now
When you up, when you up, they gon' try to shoot you down
When you up, when you up, they gon' try to shoot you down

Okay, what was that?
All of this is tripping me out, but I don't feel like that anymore
These feelings, these memories, I've moved past... all of it
What did you do?
I'm merely peering progressively deeper into your psyche

You may think these feelings no longer exist

Still and all he was awful fond to me. Who’ll search for Find Me Colours now on the hilly-droops of Vikloefells? But I read in Tobecontinued’s tale that while blubles blows there’ll still be sealskers. There’ll be others but non so for me. Yed he never knew we seen us before. Night after night. So that I longed to go to. And still with all. One time you’d stand fornenst me, fairly laughing, in your bark and tan billows of I branches for to fan me coolly. And I’d lie as quiet as a moss. And one time you’d rush upon me, darkly roaring, like a great black | shadow with a sheeny stare to perce me rawly. And I’d frozen up and pray for thawe. Three times in all. I was the pet of everyone then. A princeable girl. And you were the pantymammy’s Vulking Corsergoth. The invision of Indelond. And, by Thorror, you looked it! My lips went livid for from the joy of fear. Like almost now. How? How you said how you’d give me the keys of me heart. And we’d be married till delth to uspart. And though dev do espart. O mine!

Be happy, dear ones! May I be wrong! For she’ll be sweet for you as I was sweet when I came down out of me mother. My great blue bedroom, the air so quiet, scarce a cloud. In peace and silence. I could have stayed up there for always only. It’s something fails us. First we feel. Then we fall. And let her rain now if she likes. Gently or strongly as she likes. Anyway let her rain for my time is come. I done me best when I was let. Thinking always if I go all goes. A hundred cares, a tithe of troubles and is there one who understands me? One in a thousand of years of the nights? All me life I have been lived among them but now they are becoming lothed to me. And I am lothing their little warm tricks. And lothing their mean cosy turns. And all the greedy gushes out through their small souls. And all the lazy leaks down over their brash bodies. How small it’s all! And me letting on to meself always. And lilting on all the time. I thought you were all glittering with the noblest of carriage. You’re only a bumpkin.

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

[Chorus]
And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""

[Verse 2]
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

See, here's the thing

[Hook: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off (so sexy)
We have to party all night
We have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, oh no no no

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
Excuse me miss
I couldn't help but to notice how alone you are
I dig the attitude and how you're acting like you own the bar
Got me flashing keys and I don't even own a car
Like you ain't feeling my charm, because I know you are
I'm trying to see how your lips feel
Oh I'm sorry, my name is Travie and I'm pretty much a big deal
Oh, you've never heard of me
That sounds absurd to me
The way you stole my attention was flat out burglary
What do you say let's exit stage left so me and you can
Possibly reconvene and play some Naked Peek-A-Boo
Cause after all the blouse you're wearing is kinda see through
And it's obvious I'm heading wherever you're leading me too
Such an angel with a devilish angle
And quite the certified sweet talker
And you're buying every line of it girl
And I don't really blame you
If I was in your shoes I'd probably do the same too

[Hook: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off (so sexy)
We have to party all night
We have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, oh no no no

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
Now here's another barn burner for the slow learners
Put your helmets on and take a seat on the short bus
Next stop, right around the corner from your momma live
No turning back so you better buckle up
Shit, don't be concerned with mine
I feel like a Speak-n-Spell way I got you learning my lines
Fine, pull the string, replay that shit
I change my name to ""did he really just say that shit?"" (Yep)
I'll take a mile if you let me
Six-five, two hundred plus and so sexy
My legs going numb for keeping my phone on vibrate
To hide the fact your girlfriend keeps textin' me
And I've been trying to never mind it man
But every time I get a new number, she finds it damn
And you thought you had it sewn up
Until right around amazing o'clock when I showed up

[Hook: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off (so sexy)
We have to party all night
We have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, oh no no no

[Verse 3: Travie McCoy]
Good grief girl, you're giving me goosebumps
Standing there in your underwear and new pumps
It's like the more time we waste and less time I get to taste you
Honestly I could easily replace you
It's not a scam girl
That's how I am girl
Peter Pan, I'm a sucker for Smucker's jam girl
It's clear I'm only here for good clean fun
Shut up and kiss me like the antidotes under my tongue

Is that true?

If I could escape, I would
But first of all, let me say
I must apologize for acting stank and treating you this way
'Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor
It's your fault, you didn't shut the refrigerator
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold

If I could escape (Escape) and recreate a place that's my own world (Own world)
And I could be your favorite girl (Forever), perfectly together
And tell me boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? (Sweet escape)

You melt me down, I'm at my lowest boiling point
Come help me out, I need to get me out of this joint
Come on, let's bounce, counting on you to turn me around
Instead of clowning around, let's look for some common ground
So baby, times get a little crazy
I've been gettin' a little lazy
Waitin' on you to come save me
I can see that you're angry by the way that you treat me
Hopefully you don't leave me, wanna take you with me

(Hook)

[Scoot]

4 in the morning and we still up
And we ain't going in till we banked up
Red lights on the black and white
But niggas out here dying tryna live that life

[Lil Rod]

And when we trapping them bands, you know we do it right
On the road to success, sipping the dirty sprite

[600]

And we'll push the Bob Barker if the Price Is Right
And we'll push the Bob Barker if the Price Is Right

[Verse 1: Scoot]

And if you scared go to church
I prayed to the Game God but it didn't work
4 in the morning and we still up
Scared to death of losing tryna get it up
Keep the music down, check the rearview
Where I'm from a red light'll be the death of you
Smoking snorting sipping popping numb the pain
I lose another nigga I'ma go insane
Soft off-white coke on a dope plate
I'm outside strapped down grinding in the rain
We got that Pat Sajak, bring the fortune back
I got that Bob Barker white, if the price is right

[Verse 2: Band-Aide]

And I swore that I wouldn't go back to selling
That same shit that had my mama selling my game gifts
Just for a base hit, now they got me back on my
Basics, back in the kitchen whipping this cake mix
Nigga back to the yayo, something that I swore I
Wouldn't sell, but I'm back to the pyrex, arm and hammer and a
Scale, I'm back to the baggies I'm back to the knocks, the
Block, I'm back where it started, back to running from the
Cops, I'm back to this bullshit chasing chicken in the
Chicken shit, when you chasing chicken for your lawyer fees and
Lawyer ?, so I'ma keep chasing till my money stretch
Or my feet blister or your price is right mister
Holla, at me, B, nigga

(Hook)

[Verse 3: Lil Rod]

I'm tryna get this shit up, ain't going home tonight
I get it in all day, be trapping all night
Born trife, I'm motivated to get it
Never thought I'd see the day I put Boonts on back of my fitted
You know that I stay with it, on my hip I keep a Nia Long
Get it out a bitch or talk chicken through a microphone
Don't matter, either way I'm putting on
I'm still gunning for Lik and popping off for Stone
Tell them niggas hold on, I ain't finished yet
Niggas on that internet-banging get the mini-Tek
If you talking bout chicken I'm all in
Live life like no tomorrow, wake up and do it again
It's the 1

[Verse 4: 600]

I grew up in the hood where every block got a brother
A sinner, I eat a nigga face just for dinner
Locked up no Jadakiss, got killers on D-Block
When it's trife in the hood I push sheetrock
Heavy when I Chris Rock, Killuminati 2Pac
You know Lil Rod gon shoot if he see a opp
Bearfaced we the MOB, hit us if you need a job
I'm turnt up, got a cup of that Young Screw
Still trapping, Hoodstar like young Scoot
Look in my eyes, that's pain staring at you
The homie do bad, I toss a four lateral
Mix the coke with the baking soda that's compatible
Thank you

(Hook)

[Verse 5: ?]

Still getting free bands, why you niggas hating on me?
Got my main bitch in the bed waiting on me
Four in the morning, still up trapping
Got my lil nigga with me and he trigger happy
Lost a lot of niggas to the street life
Got some niggas in the pen facing 25
I'm damn near dozing when I'm getting high
So I'ma keep sipping till I catch a nod
Two whole zannies in a two liter
And I been a young felon, you niggas misdemeanors
I met G-Dirty off in Santa Rita
Now I'm posted all night, strapped with the nina
Knocks keep blowing up my trap phone
If you ain't talking bout chicken hear the dial tone
Still out rocking for my nigga Stone
First nigga on the block, catch me early morn'

186,Can U Believe,"[Verse 1]
Nothing can make you high
Or put fire in your eyes
Or give you a chance to fly
When you need the wings
When all that you've got is doubt
And nothing can stop you from feeling down

[Pre-Hook]
But oh, I know, I know exactly how you feel

[Hook]
But can you believe now
When you're on your knees now
Begging and pleading now
Can you believe
When all that you've got is doubt
And no one to pull you out
When your heart is slowing down
Can you believe?

[Verse 2]
See the person I love the most
Is so far away tonight
And no other medicine or promise is
Gonna heal me up right
But I got to believe
That her and me
Will be together
Cause that's all I got

[Pre-Hook]
And oh, I know, when you're down at the bottom
Can you believe?

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Can you believe when all hope seems gone
When your mother and father can't keep you safe from harm
Can you forgive in your heart?
Can you ask for forgiveness
When nobody else believes?
Can you believe?
Can you believe in yourself?

Loving and fighting
Accusing, denying
I can't imagine a world with you gone
The joy and the chaos, the demons we're made of
I'd be so lost if you left me alone
You locked yourself in the bathroom
Lying on the floor when I break through
I pull you in to feel your heartbeat
Can you hear me screaming, ""Please don't leave me!""

[Chorus]
Hold on, I still want you
Come back, I still need you
Let me take your hand, I'll make it right
I swear to love you all my life
Hold on, I still need you

[Verse 2]
Long endless highway, you're silent beside me
Driving a nightmare I can't escape from
Helplessly praying, the light isn't fading
Hiding the shock and the chill in my bones
They took you away on a table
I pace back and forth as you lay still
They pull you in to feel your heartbeat
Can you hear me screaming, ""Please don't leave me!""

Hold on, I still want you
Come back, I still need you
Let me take your hand, I'll make it right
I swear to love you all my life

Everybody's always talking at me
Everybody's trying to get in my head

I need to count on my self instead

Did you ever let go? Did you ever not know?

I'm not gonna stop, that's who I am
I'll give it all I got, that is my plan
Will I find what I lost? You know you can
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it (Bet on me)
I want to make it right, that is the way
To turn my life around, today is the day
Am I the type of guy who means what I say?
Bet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it

[Verse 2]
How will I know if there's a path worth taking?
Should I question every move I make?
With all I've lost, my heart is breaking
I don't wanna make the same mistake

194,A Different World,"[Verse 1]
I dream of a past so I can break through
The walls I have built inside
The thoughts I can grasp, transparency through
They constantly fight and collide

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd love to see a different world
A place where you can't find me

Why can't I relax and let it be true?
This world that I tried to hide
It's kind of a mess, too reckless for you

A place where you can't find me

[Bridge: Corey Taylor]
The call for the purposes, the changing behavior
Ends at us all, we keep constraints on the strangers

Harder, harder, you might just want it
Harder, harder, harder, give it to you
Harder, harder, ever think you'll ever get it

Just promise you'll remember when the sky is grey

That I should take it slow

Off again, there he go, to another dimension, my mind
Body, soul imprisoned, my eye probably goin' ballistic, but, listen
I'm missin' a couple of screws, they ain't never do drillin' true
You been sippin' away at the truth, a double shot of wisdom'll do
Do, do, rollin' through, hittin' switches
Rolling ditches, blowin' kisses, to the bitches, holdin' biscuits
What's the business? Beat the system
Co-defendants, blow the sentence, go to prison
Go to church and pray the father, Lord forgive us (Amen)
And only God can judge me (Yeah)
And he don't like no ugly
I look so fuckin' good, most dykes'll fuck me, buddy
Yeah, I'm a piece of shit, I know I plead the fifth
I tell her, ""Holler if ya need some dick""
The devotion is gettin' hopeless, but, hold it, I'm gettin' close
As my soul is, I'm seein' ghosts, a solo is now a poet
Hypnosis overdose on potions, adjustin' to the motions
And gettin' out all my emotions

Gorgeous hoes keep on the sayin' that they 'caused it
'Cause the Porsches get 'em nauseous

Paparazzi wanna nag a nigga chillin' at the bag check
Hope they show me in my good shoes
When papa got the brand new bag
Flacko got the brand new Raf, that's good news
""Hood dudes usually don't look like you""
How it feel to get a deal and come back
And the whole hood look like you?
Screamin', ""Pimp Squad, hold it down!""
Can't drive, bitch, I'm legally blind, bitch
If I live or die, it's up to me to decide
Shit, niggas coppin' guns like they legal to buy
The only key to survive and get a piece of the pie
Is to agree with a lot or just believe a façade, bitch
And I'll be fine just-a drinkin' my wine, bitch

It feels so different being here
I was so used to being next to you

Starting over - it's so hard
Seems like everywhere I try to go
I keep thinking of you

Wishing that I never let you fall
Baby you are not to blame at all
When I'm the one that pushed you away
Baby if you knew I cared
You'd have never went nowhere (nowhere)
Girl I should've been right there

How do I breathe
Without you here by my side?
How will I see
When your love brought me to the light?
Where do I go
When your heart's where I lay my head?
When you're not with me
How do I breathe?
How do I breathe?

Girl I'm losin' my mind
Yes I made a mistake
I thought that you would be mine
Guess the joke was on me

I wish I knew where you could be
Another dude is replacing me
God this can't be happening

Play it real slow, lean on the bow

Lost your control, I'm on a roll
Right all along and I knew it in my soul

Figured I'd write it in a hip hop song
Was it so hard to believe
I can make it bein' me?
Drank too much ouzo
My gosh, you know
People say a lot of things, make you feel real small
Push them out the way, iced latte tall
I don't really care, I'm already there
Caffeinated up to my eyes, I swear
I'm on the top, you on the flop
Going so long, and I'm never gonna stop
Lost your control, I'm on a roll
Right all along and I knew it in my soul

[Chorus: Amy & Nick]
I told you so
Don't wanna brag, but you already know, oh-oh
I told you so
Don't wanna brag, but you already know
You already know
I told you, I told you
I told you so, oh
I told you, I told you
I told you so

[Verse 3: Amy]
La-la-la
Look at me now, fifteen rounds
Bottle in my hand, pour a little on the ground
Next time you wanna talk trash I'mma put it on blast
You can get it if you ask for it
Put it in the middle finger of the fat ladies singing out
Shatter every glass house, ni hao (oops, uh, ha!)
Meanwhile, I smile (oh? ooh)
Then I go animal style (ooh!)
I be racking up another million
Making me another killin' superwoman on the top dollar bill
And yeah, I muster up a lot of feelings
Tell me what you really think about it
Kidding, I don't even care
Nobody listens to a full gold-coated hater
Be a baller, not a traitor
Please, got me on my knees
Talk to you later, na-na-na-na
Whoop, there it go!
Right all along and I knew it in my soul

[Chorus: Amy & Nick]
I told you so
Don't wanna brag, but you already know, oh-oh

202,Tough,"[Verse 1]
Sometimes I get sentimental (sentimental, oh)
And I get all in my head (in my head, oh)
I get caught up in my feelings (I get caught up in my feelings, oh)
And regret the things I said (I said, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
It's not magic (magic)
Baby, there's no secret to love (no no, no no no no no)
We used to have it, but I just didn't fight hard enough (yeah, enough, enough)
To hold onto you, no, oh yeah (no, yeah)
Still keep thinking 'bout the way you kiss (way you kiss)
And it's way too hard for me not to sit and reminisce (sit and reminisce)
Love is so tough, make the memories hit so hard (hit so hard, so hard)
Hit so hard, make me wanna think back, make me want that old thing back, oh no no no no (think back, old thing back)

[Verse 2]
I haven't felt this way in years (this way in years)
I want it all to stop now, girl, I hate to dream about you (about you)
'Cause I don't know how I'm gon' live my life without you, it's so hard, I'm almost in tears (without you, in tears)
But this dangerous game, girl, I've have been playing, can't seem to stop (playing, can't seem to stop)

[Chorus]
It's not magic (it's not magic)
Baby, there's no secret to love (baby, there's no secret to love, oh, woah)
We used to have it, but I just didn't fight hard enough (what happened, baby? Enough, enough)
To hold onto you, no, oh yeah
Still keep thinking 'bout the way you kiss (way you kiss)
And it's way too hard for me not to sit and reminisce (sit and reminisce)

203,All For One,"[Verse 1: Grand Puba]
I hit a beat and swing a note as if my name was David Ruffin
Quick to toast an MC just like an English muffin
Don't worry about a thing because the Puba's never bluffing
I gets headaches from the wack, so then I take a Bufferin and I max
I wait until the opportune time and then I tax but should I max?
Now they say sinning is for sinners so I guess I'm not a sinner
Beginning's for beginners so I guess I'm no beginner
This is how I spark it, puts money in my pocket
When it comes to having pleasure I gets hard as a rocket
MC Grand Pu coming through all the residue
The songs remain classics dating back to the Babalu
My boys I call 'em Akh, the foes I let 'em jock
And I can think of many episodes I swung in Lincoln Park
No I'm not a phony and I got a tenderoni
Love the way she is - not too fat, not too bony
Don't drink Sanka, won't sink like a tanker
Knock the boots off a skirt in Casablanca and I thank her
Some rappers stink like Engelbert Humperdinck
Better yet Dick Cavett, I got a bad habit
Similar to the girl on She's Gotta Have It
I think with the brain and not what’s behind the zipper
I'm living kinda good similar to Jack Tripper
A landlord named Roper did a show at the Copa
When I'm finished with this I'll be paid like Oprah
So if honey wants to act fly
I'll just play like Guy and I'm (saying, ""bye, bye, dumb bitch!"")
Stick out your thumb and hitch
Cause you've been cut off like a light switch
See I'm programmed to slam, winter, summer, spring or fall
Before I do a show I get some kicks out the mall
Then I get my gear and I give Trev a call
Cause he works in the barbershop, right behind the mall
Other rappers tried to rob me but you know they got did
To put it blunt, honey I shrunk the kids
So bookers back off break North here comes the regulator
Betcha that you find none greater

[Verse 2: Sadat X]
On file is a style, that's why you caught a clip
My suitcases is packed and I'm going on a trip
To Mic-a-delphia I go for self and still be slamming
The school bell is ringing and I caught somebody cramming
For the test, oh yes, my study guide was thick
I cut you with my verbal, didn't hurt you just a nick
Off your face, don't play possum watch me and I'll blossom
Like a rose and get some new clothes
And a fresh fade from Rob
Jamar on the phone and now the Now Rule Mob
The come one, come all, we about to get hectic
If my crew don't get in, then the X makes a exit
To the rear, I'm outta here, don't front on my brothers
I take care of them before I take care of others
The wood bats is doomed, in the 90's it's aluminum
Step to the stage with a mic and I'm doing 'em something awful
I'm a citizen and I'm lawful
I go to Hunter in the fall, rip the policemen's ball
I got the power to make a car stall
I get some drinks from Glackens, and when the crowd slackens
I stop drinking and then I start thinking about
Days in the past when Derek X was last
But now I'm on the top, damn, news travels fast
Cause I'm like that, they can't see this
Read my book, it contains many pieces of verses
I took the time to delete all the curses
So moms reach deep in your purses
And buy me, take me home and try me and do me well

[Verse 3: Lord Jamar]
Well, while I reign rhymes pour
You suck it up like a straw and jump on the dance floor
Cause every time I step in a jam
I make like a door and slam
But then girls try to turn my knob cause I'm a heart throb
I guess it's just a hazard that comes with the job
Cause every time I rock a rhyme that shows Jamar is intellectual
Girls want to get sexual
Well I guess I have to cope with being so dope
You want to be me, but can't see me with a telescope
You seek and search but still you can't find
You're weak and it hurts to be deaf, dumb and blind
A supreme mind will take you out of your paralysis
I grip the mic so tight I get callouses
And your analysis is that the Lord
Whips rhymes into shape with a mic cord
I do it good cause I'm a positive black man
Eating up suckers as if I was PacMan
Not a Dapper Dan fan, I stay casual
To rock like the J it comes gradual
You got to know the ledge to wise the dumb
And understand your culture of freedom
Power equally with the Gods
So you can build and born your cipher
All your life you must teach truth
Of the true and living God, not a mystery spook
And when you do that, pursue that goal
Which made the student enroll and only then you'll prosper",Brand Nubian,2007,"[98, 92]",2
204,Find Out Who Your Friends Are,"[Verse 1]
Run your car off the side of the road
Get stuck in a ditch way out in the middle of nowhere
Or get yourself in a bind, lose the shirt off your back
Need a floor, need a couch, need a bus fare

[Verse 2]
This is where the rubber meets the road
This is where the cream is gonna rise
This is what you really didn't know
This is where the truth don't lie

[Chorus]
You find out who your friends are
Somebody's gonna drop everything
Run out and crank up their car
Hit the gas, get there fast
Never stop to think ""What's in it for me?""
Or ""It's way too far""
They just show on up
With their big old heart
You find out who your friends are

[Verse 3]
Everybody wants to slap your back, wants to shake your hand
When you're up on top of that mountain
But let one of those rocks give way, then you slide back down
Look up and see who's around then

[Verse 4]
This ain't where the road comes to an end
This ain't where the bandwagon stops
This is just one of those times when
A lot of folks jump off

[Chorus]
You find out who your friends are
Somebody's gonna drop everything
Run out and crank up their car
Hit the gas, get there fast
Never stop to think ""What's in it for me?""
Or ""It's way too far""
They just show on up
With their big old heart
You find out who your friends are

[Bridge]
When the water's high
When the weather's not so fair
When the well runs dry
Who's gonna be there?

[Chorus]
You find out who your friends are
Somebody's gonna drop everything
Run out and crank up their car
Hit the gas, get there fast
Never stop to think ""What's in it for me?""
Or ""It's way too far""
They just show on up
With their big old heart
You find out who your friends are, yeah
You find out who your friends are

[Verse 5]
Run your car off the side of the road
Get stuck in a ditch way out in the middle of nowhere
Man I've been there
Or get yourself in a bind, lose the shirt off your back
Need a floor, need a couch, need a bus fare
Man I've been there
Man I've been there",Tracy Lawrence,2007,"[97, 87, 80, 77, 84, 82, 80, 74, 70, 66, 61, 62, 62, 63, 67, 71, 76, 79, 89, 94]",20
205,Icky Thump,"[Verse 1]
Ah, icky thump
Who'da thunk?
Sitting drunk on a wagon to Mexico

Ahh well
What a chump
Well my head got a bump
When I hit it on the radio

Redhead señorita
Looking dead
Came and said
Need a bed
In Español

I said
Gimme a drink of water
I'm gonna sing around the collar
And I don't need a microphone

[Verse 2]
Icky Thump
With a lump in my throat
Grabbed my coat
And I was freaking
I was ready to go!

And I swear
Besides the hair
She had one white eye
One blank stare
Looking up
Lying there

On the stand
Near her hand
Was a candy cane
Black rum, sugar cane
Dry ice and something strange

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

[Verse 3]
White Americans, what
Nothing better to do
Why don't you kick yourself out
You're an immigrant too

Who's using who
What should we do?
Well, you can't be a pimp
And a prostitute too

Icky thump
Handcuffed to a bunk
Robbed blind
Looked around
And there was nobody else

Left alone
I hit myself with a stone
Went home and learned how
To clean up after myself",The White Stripes,2007,"[100, 92, 83, 74, 62, 60, 55, 48, 30, 63, 87, 90, 73, 77, 65, 26, 28]",17

At the door we don't wait 'cause we know them
At the bar six shots just beginnin'
That's when dickhead put his hands on me

You don't really wanna mess with me tonight

Wanna dance, by myself, guess you're outta luck
Don't touch, back up, I'm not the one

So quit spilling your drinks on me, yeah

You know who you are
High fivin', talking shit, but you're goin' home alone aren't ya?

Are you the daughter of Frankie Beverly

Mac (Mac) L'Oreal, yep, 'cause I'm worth it
Love the way I puts it on so perfect
Wipe the corners of my mouth so I work it
When I walk down the hallway, they cain't say nothin'
Oh, oh, oh, my lips so luscious
The way I spice it up with the Mac-Mac brushes
L'Oreal got them wat-ballermelon crushes
That's probably the reason all these boys got crushes

[Chorus]
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me?
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know?
They say my lip gloss is cool, my lip gloss be poppin'

They say my lip gloss is poppin', my lip gloss is cool
All the boys keep jockin', they chase me after school

[Verse 2]
When it's time for lunch, my lips still rock
Lil' Mama melon with da hot pink top
Cherry, vanilla, flavors is a virtue
Dey, lovin lip gloss universal
The boys really like it, the girls don't speak
Rollin' they eyes, they lip gloss cheap
It ain't my fault, but I could upgrade ya
Show you how to use nice things with nice flavas

Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me?
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know?

[Verse 3]
Sittin' in eighth period, thought I was in trouble
Dean called me on the loudspeaker on the double
I stepped in her office like ""Yes, Ms. McClarkson?""
She like, ""Gurl, I ran out of my lip gloss
And write down where you get yours from
'Cause I must admit, that bubblegum
Is poppin' (Is poppin')

I've been waiting on this my whole life

These dreams be waking me up at night

You say I think I'm never wrong

You know what? Maybe you're right
A'ight?

You say he get on your fucking nerves
(And I wonder)
You hope that he get what he deserves, word
(And I wonder)
Do you even remember what the issue is?
You just trying to find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is
It ain't happen yet
And that's what intuition is
(And I wonder)
When you hop back in the car
Drive back to the crib
Run back to their arms
The smokescreens
The chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really means?

[Chorus: Labi Siffre]
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
And I wonder

[Verse 3: Kanye West & Labi Siffre]
And I'm back on my grind
A psychic read my lifeline
Told me in my lifetime
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline
And that's why I'm
(And I wonder)
Seven o'clock, that's primetime
Heaven'll watch, God calling from the hotlines
Why he keep giving me hot lines?
I'm a star, how could I not shine?
(And I wonder)
How many ladies in the house?
(If you know)
How many ladies in the house without a spouse?
(What it means)
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused
(What it means)
What you about?
(And I wonder)
On that independent shit
(If you know)
Trade it all for a husband and some kids
(What it means)
You ever wonder what it all really mean?
(To find your dreams come true)
You wonder if you'll ever find your dreams?",Kanye West,2007,"[98, 82, 75, 86, 89, 89, 94, 95, 98, 100]",10
213,Ticks,"[Verse 1]
Every time you take a sip
In this smoky atmosphere
You press that bottle to your lips
And I wish I was your beer
In the small there of your back
Your jeans are playing peekaboo
I'd like to see the other half
Of your butterfly tattoo

[Verse 2]
Hey that gives me an idea
Let's get out of this bar
Drive out into the country
And find a place to park

[Chorus]
Cause I'd like to see you
Out in the moonlight

Way back in the sticks
I'd like to walk you
Through a field of wildflowers
And I'd like to check you for ticks

[Verse 3]
I know the perfect little path
Out in these woods I used to hunt
Don't worry babe I've got your back
And I've also got your front
Now, I'd hate to waste a night like this
I'll keep you safe you wait and see
The only thing allowed to crawl
All over you when we get there is me

[Verse 4]
You know every guy in here tonight
Would like to take you home
But I've got way more class than them
Babe that ain't what I want

I'd like to kiss you
Way back in the sticks

Where everyone needs a ransom
My mama said ""love is the answer""

Right now I need you here on me

I tell you what to do whenever you need direction
You know I'm overworkin', and I cut the check like director
Take me daily, as directed

And I come from the dark side
So I'm havin' a hard time stayin' on track, man

Been in and out of relationships
So I'm startin' to see that it's me where the complications at
But I'm layin' back, prayin' that
You give that peace of mind to me
I thought I was right but really I'm wrong
Then again I was too blind to see
I was in the fast lane chasin' my dreams
And then it seem when the fame and cash came
They just got me goin' crazy-y-y, lately
I've been so faded tryin' to erase it
But I just can't ‘cause the drama just grows greater
And I've been in so many collisions by puttin' shit off 'til later

It's like I'm takin' five steps forward and ten steps back
Tryin' to get ahead of the game but I can't seem to get it on track
And I keep runnin' away the ones that say they love me the most
How could I create the distance when it's supposed to be close?
And uh, I just don't know but I be out here fightin' demons
And it's like a curse that I can't shake this part of Cleveland
And Lord, would you help me?
And stop this pain I keep inflictin' on my family?
Hustlin' and gamblin', trickin' and scramblin'
And losin' sight of what I'm supposed to be handlin'
It's hard to manage ‘cause everyday's a challenge
And man, I'm slippin', can't lose my balance, I'm tryin' not to panic

[Hook: Akon]
I tried so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man, I tried so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault ‘cause I
Try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hopin' one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here: rain, sleet, hail, snow
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here with my heat, gettin' dough

[Verse 3: Wish Bone]
I see that things won't change
I'm stuck in the game
As soon as I get out it keeps pullin' me back, mane
Got me doin' dirty dirt
So used to this hustlin' money
That I don't understand no 9-to-5 work
Studied on the streets, hustlas know what I mean
Hustlas ballin' before us
I'm tryin' to make it to that major league
So we will never leave until the sun came up
Gotta get it—no, nope, not leavin' no budge
Today games they play
Gotta go hard to get what you put in
If you fall off then it's all on you
Gotta watch what you sign to
Try so hard but I won't pull through

[Hook: Akon]
I tried so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery

223,Forever,"[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 1: Drake]
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches

Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, ""What?"" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out and goddamn, he snap

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh

There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow, fuck no
Go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake

224,Startin' With Me,"[Verse 1]
I had a one night stand with my best friend's baby sister
And to this day he still won't speak to me
I pawned my grandpa's old guitar in college
For a case of beer and a tank of gasoline
I took a swing at my old man one Christmas
I never dreamed that it would be his last
I wish mom had wrung my neck
When she caught me with those cigarettes
Which reminds me, I'm down to my last pack

[Chorus]
If I had a dime for half the things I did
That didn't make no sense at all
I'd be living a little higher on the hog
If only I'd've known that later on down the road
I'd look back and not like what I see
I'd've changed a lot of things
Starting with me

[Verse 2]
I called my brother everything I could think of
The night he wouldn't bail me out of jail
I lost a job most folks around here would die for
By laying out all night and raising hell
And I let a woman that I love slip through my fingers
Chalk another dumb move up to my foolish pride
I wasn't there standing by the bed
When the preacher bowed his head
With the family, the day my grandma die

229,Good Directions,"[Verse 1]
I was sitting there, selling turnips on a flatbed truck
Crunching on a pork rind when she pulled up
She had to be thinking, ""This is where rednecks come from""
She had Hollywood written on her license plate
She was lost and looking for the Interstate
Needing directions, and I was the man for the job

[Chorus]
I told her, way up yonder past the caution light
There's a little country store with an old Coke sign
You got to stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the Interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me

[Verse 2]
I was sitting there, thinking about her pretty face
Kicking myself for not catching her name
I threw my hat, and thought, you fool, it could have been love
I knew my old Ford couldn't run her down
She probably didn't like me anyhow
So I watched her disappear into a cloud of dust

[Chorus]
I told her, way up yonder past the caution light
There's a little country store with an old Coke sign
You got to stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the Interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me

[Bridge]
Is this Georgia heat playing tricks on me?
Or am I really seeing what I think I see?
The woman of my dreams coming back to me

[Chorus]
She went way up yonder past the caution light
Don't know why, but something felt right
When she stopped in and asked Miss Bell
For some of her sweet tea
Mama gave her a big old glass
And sent her right back here to me

Be in H-Town, Southside, Cloverland, daddy

Kept me out in Cali with my eyes open barely

Nigga came at me wrong, so we got him done
Fuckin' with the fam, I'ma give him some
Spent that corner, he didn't run
Sunday had a whole church singin' a song
Why'd they have to send my baby home?
Fuckin' with some niggas, that paper long
Been a G in the game, now my son on the throne

[Verse 5: Lil Wayne]
Ah, I am the beast
Feed me rappers or feed me beats
I'm untamed, I need a leash
I'm insane, I need a shrink
I love brain, I need a leech
Why complain on Easy Street?
I don't even talk, I let the Visa speak
And I like my Sprite Easter-pink
And my wrist-wear Chpard but the Müller's cooler
I have more jewels than your jeweler
Touch and I will bust your medulla
That's a bullet-hole, it is not a tumor
Red light, read light, stop your rumors
I stay on track like a box of Pumas
Now just r-r-rock with Junior
I am the Little Big Kahuna, y'dig?

Say what you will, what you want
Know it's not the time that you can

When nights alone and nights you're bored
And can't resist or miss the chance of being who they think they think you are
How long before your journey will end in sweet stone?
Walls inside of me that then tell me to breathe
That shake your hand and thank the man for just letting it be

Know my worth and fake the blame
But I know she's better than me

And I don't know
But I'm a go ahead and talk about it
Listen

[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
I'm sitting looking out the window like damn
Trying to fix this situation that's at hand
You still running through my mind - when I'm knowing that you shouldn't be
Me all on ya mind, I'm knowing that it couldn't be
Cause you ain't called, and I ain't even appalled
I still got a lot of pain, I ain't dealt with it all
I been running 'round with other chicks - I'm single and they loving it
I'm liking it, but I just want the one that I was in love with
That's not the end of it - I'm trying to let you go
I can't get a grip of it, is what I'm trying to let you know
You gotta hold of some kinda control on me
I don't know what it is - but I gotta get you gone from me
I'm working at it and it ain't getting no better
Just trying to be like ""yeah, forget it, whatever""
Instead of staring out this glass - looking at this bad weather
Damn I gotta pull myself together, cause...

[Hook: T-Pain]
When I'm with somebody, all I think 'bout is you
When I'm all alone - that's all I wanna do

You know what you do to me (do to me)  you don't even understand
Damn  you know what you do to me (do to me)
It's so hard to get you outta my system

[Verse 2: Bow Wow]
I'm too attached my heart want let me fall back
I got it bad that's what you can call that (ah)
And when I see you in the streets that's the worse for me
Use to love the little things you did, that's what works for me
It's too major, don't see you in my pager
Know what you doing?, where you at?, or can I see you later?
The fellas telling me just let her go Bow
Believe me I'm trying man I just don't know how
I be in all the hot spots - leaving with the hot shots
Knowing they just want me cause I'm the top spot
That's not popping, and my brain ain't stopping
Thinking who she with? Or where she going? Is she club hopping?
I never had this kinda problem in my life
This is my first time dealing with this kind of fight
It's every night, and every flight, and every time you in my sight
Damn, this ain't even right....cause

When I'm with somebody, all I think 'bout is you
When I'm all alone - that's all I wanna do
I miss the smiley faces in my sidekick out of town visits

I remember everything that me and you talked about

Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt

Upstairs in bed with my ex-boy
He's in the place but I can't get joy
Thinking on you in the final throes

Run out to meet you, chips and pitta

'cause you're not bitter
""There'll be none of him no more""
I cried for you on the kitchen floor

Freaking all on the floor with his girlfriend in the club

How long ya think that's fixin' to be ya wife?

Ya old lady look at me 'cause you ain't hitting it right
She probably used to like you cause you the business type
But that's 'til I came along and put some dick in her life
Wanna see how that ass looking thick in the light

And if I get that tonight bet I hit that twice
I can even make her mine if I hit that right
You know, smack that thang
Sit that right up on that dresser, yeah that's right
Pulling on her hair like we getting in a fight
Yeah, I know it's kind of tight but it'll sweat just right
So if ya girl sexy and she test me
Don't be upset G 'cause you might catch me
Trying to catch a glance up her skirt, the McLaren in reverse
If I see her and I like her then I'm a flirt

[Verse 3: T-Pain]

While you buying her drinks in the club, acting like you in love
Stunting like you all thug, we was switching numbers

You turn your head, she wink her eye

She be calling me daddy, I be calling her mommy
She be calling you Kelly when your name is Tommy
I don't know what y'all be thinking when you bring 'em around me
Let me remind you that I am the king of R&B
Do you know what that means? That means if you love your chick
Don't bring her to the V.I.P cause I might leave with your chick

Sipping coffee, playing Keno in the casino

Pass me the scalpel, I'll make an incision
I'll cut off the part of your brain that does the bitching
Put it in formaldehyde and put it on the shelf
And you can show it to your friends and say, ""That's my old self""
Can't do me nothing, can't tell me nada
Don't bug me now because I'm doing the lambada (bada!)
The forbidden dance (wha!), here's my chance
To make romance in my B-boy stance
Parlay romancing into financing
Opened up a restaurant with Ted Danson
The roaches check in, but they never check out
I set the record straight, no doubt

This is why I'm hot (hot!), this is why I'm hot (hoo!)

This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (hot!)

[Verse 1]
This is why I'm hot: I don't gotta rap
I could sell a mill sayin' nothin' on the track
I represent New York, I got it on my back
Niggas say that we lost it so I'ma bring it back
I love the Dirty Dirty 'cause niggas show me love
The ladies start to bounce as soon as I hit the club
But in the Midwest, they love to take it slow
So when I hit the H, I watch 'em get it on the flo'
And if you need it hyphy, I take it to the Bay
'Frisco to Sac-Town, they do it erryday
Compton to Hollywood, soon as I hit L.A
I'm in the low-low, I do it the Cali way (woo!)
And when I hit the Chi, people say that I'm fly
They love the way I dress, they like my attire
They love how I move crowds from side-to-side
They ask me how I do it and simply I reply:

This is why I'm hot (hot!), this is why I'm hot (hot!) (yeah!)

This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (hot!)

[Verse 2]
This is why I'm hot, catch me on the block
Every other day, another bitch, another drop
Sixteen bars, twenty-four a pop
Forty-four a song, nigga, gimme whachu got
I'm into drivin' cars, fresh up off the lot
I'm into shuttin' stores down just so I could shop
If you need a bird, I could get it chopped
Tell me whachu need, you know I get 'em by the flock
I call my homie Black, meet me on the Ave
I hit Wash Heights wit' the money in the bag
We into big spendin', see, my pimpin' never drag
Find me with different women that you niggas never had
For those who say they know me, know I'm focused on my cream
Player, you come between, you better focus on the beam
I keep it so mean, the way you seen me lean
And when I say I'm hot, my nigga, this is what I mean

[Chorus]
This is why I'm hot (hot!), this is why I'm hot (hot!) (yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (huh!)

I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (not!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (hot!)

This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (hot!)

[Verse 3]
This is why I'm hot, shorty see the drop
Asked me what I paid and I say ""Yeah, I paid a guap""
And then I hit the switch that take away the top
So chicks around the way, they call me Cream of the Crop
They hop in the car, I tell 'em ""All aboard""
We hit the studio, they say they like how I record
I gave 'em Black Train and I Did You Wrong
So every time I see them, man, they tell me that's they song
They say I'm the bomb, they love the way the charm
Hangin' from the neck and compliments the arm
Which compliments the ear, then comes the gear (woo!)
So when I hit the room, the shorties stop and stare (ha!)
Niggas start to hate, rearrange they face
But, little do they know, I keep them things by waist side
I reply ""Nobody got to die""
Similar to Lil Weez 'cause I got the fire

This is why I'm hot (hot!), this is why I'm hot (hot!) (yeah!)

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulkin' to the masses

Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...

Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain

Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh

I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again
They’ve always been so kind
But now they’ve brought you away from me
I hope they didn't get your mind
Your heart is too strong anyway
We need to fetch back the time
They have stolen from us

And I want you
We can bring it on the floor

No sun is shining anymore
The only thing I feel is pain
Caused by absence of you
Suspense controlled in my mind
I cannot find the way outta here

254,Doomsday Clock,"Is everyone afraid?
Is everyone ashamed?
They’re running towards their holes, to find out
Apocalyptic means are lost among our dead
A message to our friends to get out

There’s wages on this fear
Oh so clear
Depends on what you’ll pay to hear

They’re bound to kill us all
In whitewashed halls
Their jackals lick their paws

Please don’t stop
It’s lonely at the top
These lonely days
When will they ever stop?
This doomsday clock ticking in my heart
Not broken

I love life every day
In each and every way
Kafka would be proud, to find out
I’m certain of the end
It’s the means that has me spooked
It takes an unknown truth to get out

I’m guessing i’m born free, silly me
I was meant to beg from my knees

Please don’t stop
It’s lonely at the top
These lonely days
When will they ever stop?
This doomsday clock ticking in my heart
These lonely days when will they ever stop?

We gotta dig in, gas masks on
Wait in the sunshine, all bug-eyed
If this is living?
Sakes alive!
Well then they can’t win
No one survives

Is everyone afraid?
You should be ashamed
Apocalyptic screams
Mean nothing to the dead
Kissing that ‘ol sun
To know all there is
Come on, last call
You should want it all

Ah, it’s lonely at the top
These lonely days
When will they ever stop
This doomsday clock ticking in my heart
These lonely days
When will they ever stop
This ticking in my heart

It's just a one-way conversation

It's been some time since we last spoke
This is gonna sound like a bad joke
But Momma, I fell in love again
It's safe to say I have a new girlfriend
And I know it sounds so old
But Cupid got me in a chokehold
And I'm afraid I might give in
Towel's on the mat, my white flag is wavin' (Mbabarara)
I mean, she even cooks me pancakes
And Alka-Seltzer when my tummy aches
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is
We even got a secret handshake
And she loves the music that my band makes
I know I'm young, but if I had to choose her or the sun
I'd be one nocturnal son of a gun (Mbabarara, mbabarara)

Type of girl that'll make you way proud of your son
And I know you heard the last song
About the girls that didn't last long
But I promise this is on a whole new plane
I can tell by the way she says my name (Mbabarara)
I love the way she calls my phone
She's even got her very own ringtone
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is (Mbabarara)
It's gonna be a long drive home
But I know as soon as I arrive home
And I open the door, take off my coat, and throw my bag on the floor

She's got porcelain skin, of course she's a ten
Now she's even got her own song (But movin' on)
She's got the cutest laugh I ever heard
And we can be on the phone for three hours (Not sayin' one word)
And I would still cherish every moment
And when I start to build my future, she's the main component

261,A Woman's Love,"Late every night when I am all alone
I call my baby on the telephone
If she was here she'd treat me right
And love me love me through this lonely night
Oh I can remember how her love can be
And I can't forget the way she looks at me
She tells me as she took my hand
It takes a woman's love to make a man

We're on the road tryin' to sell a song
Been on this road for much too long
All day all night it's drivin' me insane
Cause I don't know when I'll see her face again
I know it's what I've got to do
And I love her cause she knows it too
She surely made me understand
It takes a woman's love to make a man (5X)

I give her love cause what else can it be?
I give to her just what she wants from me
She loves me hard, she loves me right
She'll love me love me through this lonely nite
Then happiness we'll surely know
Until again it will be time to go
Oh she loves me like nobody can
I know that women made me understand
It takes a woman's love to make a man
I know that woman made me understand
It takes a woman's love to make a man",Kansas,2007,"[90, 82, 73, 77, 73, 73, 73, 74, 78, 88, 88, 89]",12

There was a time
I packed my dreams away
Living in a shell
Hiding from myself
There was a time
When I was so afraid
I thought I'd reached the end
Baby, that was then
I am made of more than my yesterdays

[Chorus]
This is my now
And I am breathing in the moment
As I look around
I can't believe the love I see
My fears behind me
Gone are the shadows and doubt
That was then
This is my now

[Verse 2]
I had to decide
Was I gonna play it safe?
Well, but somewhere deep inside
I tried to turn the tide
And find the strength o take that step of faith

[Chorus]
This is my now
And I am breathing in the moment
As I look around
I can't believe the love I see
My fears behind me
Gone are the shadows and doubt
That was then
This is my now

[Bridge]
And I have a courage
Like never before, yeah
I settled for less
But I'm ready for more
Ready for more

[Chorus]
This is my now
And I am breathing in the moment
As I look around
I can't believe the love I see
My fears behind me
Gone are the shadows and doubt
That was then
This is my now

As I look around
I can't believe the love I see
My fears behind me

After water pipe exploded in the living room wall
If your washer and dryer in need of repair
You know the handyman's waiting
And he'll be right there

If it's getting clogged up or maybe starting to leak
Just ring up my number, baby, give me a try

I'm down to my last dollar I've walk right though my shoes
Just a small reminder of the hell that I've gone through
But look at me still smiling as I'm wondering what I'll do
Since I ain’t got nothing I've got nothing to lose
Everybody say ""hahaha, hahaha""
My friends are always giving me watches, hats, and wine
That's how I know this is serious that's how I know it's time

The last man on Earth
Gave him everything she ever had

Give a little, then take it back

He'd just shoot 'em down
Lord he loved to make her cry

You'll ever leave the ground""
He said, ""Only angels know how to fly""

He wondered why she didn't leave
He went up to the bedroom
Found a note by the window
With the curtains blowin' in the breeze

[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
Yep, yep, yep, yep
Let me paint this picture for you, baby

[Verse: Justin Timberlake]
You spend your nights alone and he never comes home
And every time you call him, all you get's a busy tone
I heard you found out that he's doin' to you
What you did to me, ain't that the way it goes?
When you cheated, girl, my heart bleeded, girl
So it goes without sayin' that you left me feelin' hurt
Just a classic case, a scenario
Tale as old as time, girl, you got what you deserved

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And now you want somebody (Hey)
To cure the lonely nights (Hey)
You wish you had somebody (Hey)
That could come and make it right (Hey)
But girl, I ain't somebody (Hey)
With a lot of sympathy (Hey)
You'll see, see

Hop up out the chevy no rims no nothing
When it comes to the tracks I win no running
I leave your girl cumming, wetter than a faucet
Never been gay I ain't got no closet
Safety deposit, Key with the little door
Your girl is my ho, Your wife is a little whore
More girls than VH1
I got a Hemi but I'm healthy like a V8 son
I'm ballin' premature like Lebron
Blowing up like a terrorist I'm the bomb
Wait I'm Sadom, No, I'm Osama
I am the party like DJ Trauma

I see you but still there's no deal-y
Deal or no Deal, I'll still lyrically kill

Hello He's back like a serial
Killer where's the milk for my cherrios
Here we go, back and forth like ping pong
Walk in side the club and they gave me a theme song
I'm so right like a left wrong turn
That baby don't look like me shawty got the wrong sperm
Hey when will you learn, just because you gave me brain
I am not Barack Obama so stop expecting change
Yeah Cause I don't pay bills
No silicone I like my girls real
Pill popping animal, Syrup sipping nigga
Patron got me faded I ball like the clippers
She playing with my zipper got my dick wetter than flipper
I'm gone off patron but still I'll never lick her
I hit her, quit her, on to the next
Now she on twitter, like who he gone tweet next

Yeah, on another level, bass clef no treble
No G to gent cause I'm a muhfuckin rebel

I'm hot earths core thats my longitude latitude
No attitude just swagger
Well she had a dude but I bagged her
Toe tagged her, like a crime scene
No lie I'm the truth in my religion jeans
Yeah My nigga's clean, Me and My nigga's be
Rappers nightmares Dog we living dreams
We living nice, good life no Kanye
I'm a Big Boi but still a OutKast like Andre'

278,I Who Have Nothing,"I, I who have nothing

[Verse 1: Ikon]
Intersections in real time
The unbroken circle and dimensions of the mind
The tie that binds
The eternal tie that defines
The vanity of my insanity in due time
Will shine
Like the night seas under the moon
The haunted corners of familiar rooms
Yet I'm consumed
We're vanishing into thin air
The realization that this shit is my cross to bear
So where
Did I think I could run away to see
The people that decided to leave without asking me
But we
Decide to wait for happier tomorrows
And find someone so they can be distractions from our sorrow
But my distractions the books of paper that I scrawl in
I'm eloquent as summer breeze and leaves that have just fallen
I've crawled in a corner hoping all of this will end
With the knowledge that love is just another word for revenge
I who have nothing but the comfort of my sins
I who have nothing but the comfort of my friends

[Hook]
I, I who have nothing
I, I who have no one
I, I who have nothing
I, I who have no one

[Verse 2: Ikon]
As I decay, demons prey above me like a vulture
Ability to endure contradiction is a high sign of culture
Verbal sculptures, self defacing
It is not God or lunacy that I am facing
But the erasing of the purity and passion of my words
The herds of cattle babble on with talk of the absurd
But I preferred
To walk away from all the feuds
To find my life is more confusing than a rubic's cube
So I'm subdued
In all my words of verbal prods
To live alone one must be an animal or a God
But it's official
All of my pain is clear as crystal
The natural side of life has now been seeming artificial
But I can hit you
And rest assured that I'mma last words
I could give a fuck about ya secrets and ya past words
I can pass words and their ability to hurt you
Patience is a virtue and knowledge is of commercial
I who have nothing but the pain that I refer to
I who have nothing but the pain that I've refered to

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ikon]
Lost among the miracles, I stand alone
And I've grown into a being that's sitting on top a throne
I've known
For many years that I would turn to rust
I find a reason for another breath
Before my return to dust
I become one with science and mathematics and the rising of the sun
I'm numb
To all of those who blind and cannot see
The chastiser of the enemy
Perception requires duality
Inspect ya soul, the color of coal inside the body
I have hardly come across them who's holy
Send them to the cherubim to control thee
Burning of the sun and frigidness of the cold
The battlefield is new but the war is now old
You can never see the merest shadow of a halo
Above the head of evil djin who's deadly like tornado
The world has become an aquarium
Full of gaping fish with murderous smiles
I on the other hand stand on the outside looking in
Writing down murderous files
I who have nothing but the lack of variation
And I who have nothing but chains and suffocation

I’m just disappointing you

Lonely nights like these you just stumble in my head
And I’m wondering what you’re doing
And why maybe I'm not dead
The thought of you still kills me
I know I’m a stupid guy
Looking back at my mistakes, I fucked up a million times
I couldn't see the day
I never called somebody mine
Cause every single heartbreak made me lose my fucking mind
I guess I was too blind
Girl, I see that you were right for me
I had to fuck it up, I’m sorry this is not goodbye
I let this so-called fame get deep into my head
And I'd end up doing thoughtless things
That I soon would regret
I made you feel special
And I should've felt the same
Cause I had you by my side
How could I have been this way

I don't think I’m meant to be with you

286,How To Save A Life,"Step one, you say, ""We need to talk.""
He walks, you say, ""Sit down. It's just a talk.""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
Pray to God, he hears you
And I pray to God, he hears you

And where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness

288,Over It,"[Intro]
No matter what way the fans receive music
We at Strange Music
Will be right there in it
All those streaming services make it nearly impossible for artist to make some real bread
We will prevail and take over all facets of the music industry

[Hook: Ryan Bradley]
All of us are over it
So we're takin' over it
So cold the shoulder gets
'Cause we're over it, over it
So we're takin' over it

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Time's up, I'm just
Gonna make it difficult for other rappers to get they rhymes up
N9ne's a mindfuck, I'm the kind to
Design the crime, bury them all in lime, your shine's behind us
Stop, you could do it all day
But you're not gonna pop me the crew and all lay
In the box, you were topping the charts
Look at the people not even jockin' your art
Why's that? 'Cause everybody that really buys rap
Don't wanna listen to any guys yap
Fly! This'll leave you in the sky cap (ahoo!)
Three X, we test the best
Reflect 'cause you're 'bout to go see death
And the killer gonna be Tech, he next
All the people never gonna re-elect such a reject
When I spit vital with this title
You sit idle like Seacrest, we over it

All of us are over it
So we're takin' over it
So cold the shoulder gets
'Cause we're over it, over it
So we're takin' over it

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Better pray that they want to come see your show
That right there gonna be your dough
You fizzin' out and we want more, we gon' blow
Them all away then haul away
The raw decay then y'all will say ""we don't know""
The K.O.D'll spray the fraud away
Make it a holiday, see killin' when he don't flow
I’m enhanced and polished
All of the women, they wanna dance and frolic
You was a winner with lotta grands in pockets
Now you get rants and audits
We bored wit'cha, quick to hit ya with the war whip
The scripture mister, Forbes lister
Bigger figure from a poor nigga!
A lot of y'all names I could say
If I was evil, I really would Sway
But I was taught to not be no punk
And don't pull no punches, my hood say
But since y'all actin' like Biancas and Beatrices
I should say, your last album was everywhere
And I don't mean that in a good way, we over it

I'm forever, makes you wanna scream
'Cause I'm the one and king

Don't be devastated due to my dialect
Dummies down declining due to die in debt, die in debt
When you wake and wonder why you wide and wet
Wicked whispers whiskin' away you, why invest? Why invest?
Ain't no competition so get violent
Ain't expectin' nothin' but ya silence, silence
So fly your noggin, I can be the fucking pilot
I know you know my number you can dial it, dial it
You got to know by now that I'm really unstoppable
Try now, you'll be silly in a hospital
Lie down, got the pilly and I lock and load
I'm takin' everything, breakin' everything you'll spit
This ain't nothin' to me, child's play
That's why I'm takin' over this (Bullshit!)

Slammin' Bentley doors like we invented doors
20 years ago we drove Bentley Azures
We drinkin' Cristal then
Yeah, kept the tray on me like Chris Paul then
Drinkin' Ace of Spades like it's codeine now
Tryna put a million on the whole team now
Push through the pain so we can see new life
So all the ladies havin' babies, see ya sacrifice
Mama had four kids, but she's a lesbian
Had to pretend so long that she's a thespian
Had to hide in the closet, so she medicate
Society shame and the pain was too much to take
Cried tears of joy when you fell in love
Don't matter to me if it's a him or her
I just wanna see you smile through all the hate
Marie Antoinette, baby, let 'em eat cake

[Chorus: JAY-Z & Stevie Wonder]
Bad times turn to good memories, smile
Even when I'm gone and you remember me, smile
Good times never fade away, smile
Even if I'm not with you here today, smile
Good morn' or evening, friends
Smile
Here's your friendly announcer

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Far as draft picks, my name did not get called
Bet before I go I put a billion on the board
Hall of Fame Hov, I did it all without a pen
Y'all knew that was comin', I had to remind y'all again, huh?
Flyin' paper planes through the projects
Now the whole projects on my jet
Now you see the real in the front row
In every one of y'all televised shows
Super facts
Niggas switched sides, traded pride, we don't do all that
A loss ain't a loss, it's a lesson
Appreciate the pain, it’s a blessin'

I mastered my aesthetics
I know you often heard me wax poetic
'Bout bein' back in the Lexus
But trust me, that was nothin', a nigga up in
The hundreds of millions, I have no ceilings
Ah, this that feelin', I'm that boy
Anita Baker's ""You Bring Me Joy"" slappin' out of the toy
The separation is clear in my rear-view mirror
Objects is further than they appear
Oh yeah, I was born with a pair, playin' for high stakes
Norman's Cay, he looked up and out of the Lear
How niggas can't relate?
Fuck a slice of the apple pie, want my own cake
In charge of my own fate, respect Jimmy Iovine
But he gotta respect the Elohim as a whole new regime
And niggas playin' for power, huh
So our music is ours, niggas own their own houses
Ours was, ""Fuck you, pay me""
Now it's, ""Fuck payin' me, I pay you
Put the rest away for Blue""
That blood money I giggle at it
Can't even support my miss' habit
Jewelry shoppin' in Pa- all ya jewelers should be embarrassed
Huh, blood diamonds drippin' with guilt, I still ain't trippin'
That's life, winners and losers
Drug dealers and abusers, America likes me ruthless
My therapist said I relapsed
I said, ""Pre-haps I Freudian slipped in European whips""
God sent me to break the chain, I'm the true and livin'
God in the flesh, the rest of these niggas is vain
A stain on the white suit, inferior IQ
Niggas'll rip your shit off TIDAL just to spite you
Ahhhh, what did I do? 'Cept try to free you
Niggas'll love you but hate you 'cause they can't be you
Dump 'em all in the bayou, uh
Everybody wave bye to the guy you thought you could lie to
This was meant to be a haiku, huh
But my story's too wide to fit inside the line or two
Oh, these that drugs, heron flow, I spaz on the stove
This is Hov, no flex zone, nigga, who lied to you?
Look, you a pedestrian, don't ever question the security I provided you
Oh y'all thought I was washed? I'm at the cleaners
Launderin' dirty money like the Teamsters, huh
Shout out to Hoffa back home, he in the church
When I heard you got booked, that shit hurt
Feel for you bro, we know the system don't work
Take a young nigga freedom over some dirt
Yet it's legal in Colorado, yet, we deny
Black entrepreneurs, free enterprise
That's why it's a black market, that's why it's called the trap
That's why it's called the projects 'cause it's exactly that
All these people was gon' kill me, heh
'Cause the more I reveal me, the more they 'fraid of the real me
Welcome back Carter, smile

[Outro: Gloria Carter]
Living in the shadow
Can you imagine what kind of life it is to live?
In the shadows people see you as happy and free
Because that's what you want them to see
Living two lives, happy, but not free
You live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or the person you love
The world is changing and they say it's time to be free
But you live with the fear of just being me
Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be
No harm for them, no harm for me
But life is short, and it's time to be free
Love who you love, because life isn't guaranteed

290,Beer In Mexico,"[Verse 1]
Staring out into the wild blue yonder
So many thoughts to sit and ponder
'Bout life and love and lack of
And this emptiness in my heart
Too old to be wild and free still
Too young to be over the hill
Should try to grow up
But who knows where to start

[Chorus]
So I just sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Do my best to waste another day
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Let the warm air melt these blues away

[Verse 2]
Sun comes up and sun sinks down
And I seen them both in this tourist town
Up for days in a rage
Just trying to search my soul
From the answers and the reasons why
I'm at these crossroads in my life
And I really don't know
Which way to go

[Chorus]
So I just sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Do my best to waste another day
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Let the warm air melt these blues away

[Bridge]
Maybe I'll settle down, get married
Or stay single and stay free
Which road I travel
Is still a mystery to me

[Chorus]
So I just sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Do my best to waste another day
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Let the warm air melt these blues away

I'm gonna turn this thing around

The good old days, the honest man
The restless heart, the Promised Land
A subtle kiss that no one sees

Before you go, can you read my mind?

It’s funny how you just break down
Waiting on some sign
I pull up to the front of your driveway
With magic soaking my spine
Can you read my mind?
Can you read my mind?

The teenage queen, the loaded gun
The drop dead dream, the Chosen One
A southern drawl, a world unseen
A city wall and a trampoline
Oh, well, I don't mind, if you don't mind

Before you jump, tell me what you find
When you read my mind

Fiendin' for attention but you ain't gonna get none
Five star plate and I like my steak well done
Bitch, you know I'm cookin' up, got 'em shooken up
They was lookin' down on me, now they lookin' up
Gettin' to a bag, what you think, I'ma run it up
If I'm on the dancefloor you know I'ma fuck it up
Ayy, had to go and hit 'em with the moves real quick (Ooh)
Brand new kicks and they match with the fit (Ooh)
Oh shit, I'm lit, I think I just made a hit (Yeah)
They ain't really see it coming 'cause I did it so quick
Skater boy, bitch, I feel like Eric Koston (What?)
I'm so fly, feel like I'm up in the cockpit (What?)
Got no time on my grind, I ain't stoppin' (What?)
Bitches on my dick 'cause they know the boy poppin' (Aha)
Whoa, hold up, drop it down, get low
Always- always on the move but you know I tiptoe (Tiptoe)
Always up to something but I keep it on the low
Got too much sauce like I work at Domino's
Y'all cheesy, bitch, I got the keys like Stevie
Pink like watermelon, green like a kiwi
I gotta get it done, feelin' like a Meeseeks
They was hatin' on me, now they wishin' they could be me

295,With Love,"[CADY]
When I was five, I fell in love
It didn’t last
He ran from me
Literally ran from me
And being Kenyan, he ran fast

When I was ten, in love again
This Peace Corps guy
I waited hours
Inside his tent with flowers
Which made him laugh
Which made me cry

By thirteen I gave up trying
I decided I would be a mathematician
'Cause math is real
I memorized a lot of pi
Because addition and subtraction and division
Would never make me feel
So stupid with love

Like I didn't get it
I didn't get it, somehow
Smart with math but stupid with love
I didn't get it
I didn't get it
Till now

[AARON, spoken]
Do you have an eraser?

[CADY, spoken]
I would love to. 

(sung)
So thank you, math, for being there
To bring me joy
And thank you, math
'Cause now you've brought me
This cute boy!

[AARON, spoken]
Is it two?

[CADY, spoken]
Yes!

(sung)
He's like someone from TV
He’s like that guy who gives out roses to those women
His clothes, his grooming

And he's a foot away from me
With swoopy hair and shiny eyes that I could swim in
He is live and in the room

And I'm
Stupid with love
I wanna get it
I wanna get it, but how?
Smart with math but stupid with love
I wanna get it
I didn't get it
Till now

[CADY & AARON, spoken]
Two over zero is undefined. 

[AARON]
Jinx. 

[CADY]
I'm astounded and non-plussed
I am filled with calcu-lust
Does this guy work out? He must!
All sweaty at the gym

Could that image be more hot?
Let me just enjoy that thought
School was rough but now it's not

'Cause now there's him
It's all so simple

Stupid with love
But I can get it
Watch this girl self-educate
I learned math so I can learn love

You wanna bet it?
That I can get it?

296,Vulnerable,"[Verse 1]
If I give you every piece of me, I know that you could drop it
Give you the chance, I know that you could take advantage once you got it
If I open up my heart to you, I know that you could lock it
Throw away the key, and keep it there forever in your pocket
If I give the opportunity to you, then would you blow it?
If I was the greatest thing to happen to you, would you know it?
If my love was like a flower, would you plant it? Would you grow it?
I'ma give you all my body, are you strong enough to hold it?

[Pre-Chorus]
If I show you all my demons and we dive into the deep end
Would we crash and burn like every time before?

I'll stay vulnerable, yeah
I'll stay vulnerable, yeah
I'll stay vulnerable

[Verse 2]
If I hand you my emotions, would you even wanna take it?
(Would you even wanna take it? Yeah)
If I give you all my trust, then would you fumble it and break it?
(Mm, mm, mm, mm)
If I let you cross my finish line, then would you wanna make it?
(Would you wanna make it, would you wanna make it?)
I think I'm ready, won't you come and flip the switch and activate it? (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
If I show you all my demons and we dive into the deep end
Would we crash and burn like every time before?

297,Long Trip Alone,"[Verse 1]
It's a long trip alone over sand and stone
That lie along the road that we all must travel down

[Chorus]
So maybe you could walk with me a while
And maybe I could rest beneath your smile
Everybody stumbles sometimes and needs a hand to hold
Cause it's a long trip alone

[Verse 2]
It's a short piece of time but just enough to find
A little peace of mind under the sun somewhere

[Chorus]
So maybe you could walk with me a while
And maybe I could rest beneath your smile
Everybody stumbles sometimes and needs a hand to hold
Cause it's a long trip alone

[Verse 3]
And I don't know where I'd be without you here
Cause I'm not really me without you there

Brush my hair back and kick the ho out the do'
Flip a coin see which ride I'm pullin' up out the garage
Wireless transmitters send the bump from my i-pod
Pull a pack out and fill my body up with sin
Ten o'clock at night but my day has just begin

And they impressed by how my ear lookin' Aquafina clear

Yeah, you know what it is don't call me Chamillionaire
Now the world gotta address me as the hustler of the year
I'm the man to respect, I'm demandin' respect
Or I'm commandin' that cannon through that damage to chest
Ain't a hustler or another on the planet as fresh

I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away
I can so over-complicate, people tell me to medicate

When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary
When troubles come and my heart burdened me
Then, I am still and wait here in the silence
Until you come and sit a while with me

301,Signal Fire,"[Intro: Jesse Cash]
Metamorphosis; what am I becoming
Liable; or a victim of circumstance?
Bending disorder to appease my own defense

[Verse 1: JT Cavey]
This bond could not be conceived without affection and faith to believe
It was all meant to endure the worst of things
Cast aside your doubts and destructive thoughts
I know that I can finally be enough

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
The signal fire is flickering
Breaths start to cease, and I wonder
If she calls my name out from the edge of the sea

[Verse 2: JT Cavey & Jesse Cash]
Tones of crimson gleam to fill the space between
The animation in my arteries
Cruel impermanence; the weight of the unknown
Has stricken me with a feeling of turbulence
Holding out for a softer consequence

[Verse 3: JT Cavey]
Stand true; we are absolute
Doubt breathes through blushing leaves
Eradicated with my will to be
Convoluted ideas and emotions
That make their home in me, weigh me down
They make their home in me

[Interlude: Jesse Cash]
Drifting away into the comfort of false safety

[Chorus: Jesse Cash]
The signal fire is flickering
Breaths start to cease, and I wonder
If she calls my name out from the edge of the sea

Move in sync with passage of light
Through my fingertips
Aligned on each notch of my spine
Where shivers won't dare resist

Breaths start to cease, and I wonder
If she calls my name out from the edge of the sea",Erra,2007,"[82, 65]",2

""The last time we talked, Mr. Smith, you reduced me to tears. I promise you it won't happen again.""

Do I attract you?
Do I repulse you with my queasy smile?
Am I too dirty? Am I too flirty?
Do I like what you like?

I could be wholesome, I could be loathsome
I guess I'm a little bit shy
Why don't you like me, why don't you like me
Without making me try?

I tried to be like Grace Kelly, mm
But all her looks were too sad, ah
So I tried a little Freddie, mm
I've gone identity mad!

I could be brown, I could be blue
I could be violet sky
I could be hurtful, I could be purple
I could be anything you like

Gotta be green, gotta be mean
Gotta be everything more

Why don't you walk out the door!

""Getting angry doesn't solve anything.""

How can I help it, how can I help it
How can I help what you think?
Hello my baby, hello my baby
Putting my life on the brink

Why don't you like me, why don't you like me
Why don't you like yourself?
Should I bend over? Should I look older
Just to be put on your shelf?

I tried to be like Grace Kelly, mm
But all her looks were too sad, ah
So I tried a little Freddie, mm
I've gone identity mad!

But you only want what everybody else says you should want...

I could be violet sky
I could be hurtful, I could be purple
I could be anything you like

Gotta be green, gotta be mean
Gotta be everything more
Why don't you like me? Why don't you like me?
Walk out the door!

I could be brown, I could be blue
I could be violet sky
I could be hurtful, I could be purple

When I'm on that beat, I'm a beast, I ain't never came weak
Got a mouth full of diamonds you can hardly hear me speak

Got a styrofoam cup full o' barre

Freestylin' like hair braids
Makin' that candy dance
I'm throwed off the Cali plants
I'm prancin' on the scene crawlin' down like fire ants
My mind in a trance
I'm sharper than starched pants
Stackin' Franklins and Grants from South Bank to Spring Branch
I'm posted like a stamp with my mind on cash
I'm wheel grippin' and still tippin' brandy wine on glass
I got a screen in the dash
A quarter-tank full of gas
Smokin' that puff puff pass
Throwed I hope I don't crash
Reppin' that Swisha Blast, so I'm flyer than a mockin' bird
Throwed in the mode, game cold as a iceberg, baby

Pack protection cus playa hatin' spread like STDs
I'm cool as an ocean breeze
Like Chester I'm chasing cheese
I'm stangin' like buzzin' bees
On South Lee with the G's
Screens fall like autumn leaves
Make the TVs rain

Movin' at slow pace with T-Ferris my ace
Cup full of expensive taste
Open mouth and showcase
I'm throwed with screens hangin' swangin' breakin' the struts
We pourin' up in them cups that stuff got me leanin' tough
Hold up
I'm caked up so all the boppers attract
I got 'em like a soccer mile out there runnin' the track
Pullin' capers makin' paper stacks fly as a dove

She leads me through moonlight
Only to burn me with the sun
She's taken my heart
But she doesn't know what she's done

Feel her breath in my face
Her body close to me
Can't look in her eyes

Am I just fooling myself
That she'll stop the pain?
Living without her
I'd go insane

Come harder, this won't be easy
Don't doubt yourself, trust me, you need me
This ain't a shoulder with a chip or a ego
But what you think they all mad at me for?

Then ya dynasty ain't complete without a chief, like me

317,You,"[Verse 1]
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I

[Verse 2]
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much

Crème de la crème, homie, top shelf you know

Down low, down low, down low, I like my top let back
Let back, let back, let back let back, let back

[Hook]
I like my beat down low and my top let back
Can see me ridin 24's with a chopper in the back
You like your Kenwood hot and your top let back
If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black
I like my beat down low and my top let back
Can see me ridin 24's with a chopper in the back
You like your Kenwood hot and your top let back
If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black

[Verse 1]
I'm the man in my city ain't nobody fucking wit me
You can ask the real niggas and all the bad bitches
I'm a known drug dealer I always have 50's
And the thugs and the killers was all in class wit me
SS'S on 26's watching some television
Shorty I'm never slipping got the Beretta in vision
And ready to pop the clip in, ready to get to tripping
Ready to show these folks a celebrity pistol whipping
Pimp stole the automobile and the roof for the tag missing
Polices' try to pursue me it's nothing but gas given
Addicted to fast living, guess I'm one of my dad's children
Think I'm bad now, you should've seen me before I had children
Give dick to your daddy's daughter and dare her to have children
Hope he got some insurance cause death her ass is enduring
Kill her in Mississippi and drive her ass to Missouri
Still my wet paint drippin' while I'm woodgrain gripping

I like my beat down low and my top let back
Can see me ridin 24's with a chopper in the back

If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black

[Verse 2]
I got this Pimp Squad Click, I know you heard about us
Young niggas filthy rich and we ain't worried about much
On this Glock I clutch, In God I trust
If a fuck nigga start, bet his heart I bust
Got your partners and the broad in your car fucked up
What, you're under estimation thought a star wouldn't bust
I got the heart and the guts on this purp I blow
Move 10 bricks daily trying to twerk 5 mo'
Ya see the Cadillac swerving down Hollywood Road
On the fliest Spur in Cali fucking Hollywood Ho's
On a pill and half with my partner Young Dro
Bumping Goodie Mob Soul Food number fo'
Other rappers' old news, told dudes I'ma pro
With a loaded fo' fo' and a quarter brick of blow
(Hey) nigga don't you hit me less you buying 6 or mo
My 24 blades glistening and my 808 kicking

If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black

[Verse 3]
I wear the crown down under man somebody better tell 'em
'Fore I spit a hundred rounds and have everybody bailing
I got some bitches in a Benz and my partners in the Chevy
And now we riding Giovanni's and Asani's on Pirellis
If you ever think of trying to run up on me just forget it
The clip in the chopper long as ya leg and leave ya shredded
Pistol way in the truck got my knife on tuck
You think he ain't getting stuck, you got life fucked up
A couple stitches in ya hip will have your night fucked up
Will he live? Will he die? Guess he might luck up
Meanwhile, I'm racing my Ferrari like a light for a buck
Against Lamborghini Gallardos every time I get a car

319,Into The Ocean,"[Verse 1]
I'm just a normal boy
That sank when I fell overboard
My ship would leave the country
But I'd rather swim ashore
Without a life vest, I'd be stuck again
Wish I was much more masculine
Maybe then I could learn to swim
(Like fourteen miles away)
Now floating up and down
I spin, colliding into sound
Like whales beneath me diving down
I'm sinking to the bottom of my
Everything that freaks me out
The lighthouse beam has just run out
I'm cold as cold as cold can be
Be

[Chrous]
I want to swim away but don't know how
Sometimes it feels just like I'm falling in the ocean
Let the waves up take me down
Let the hurricane set in motion, yeah
Let the rain of what I feel right now come down
Let the rain come down

[Verse 2]
Where is the coastguard?
I keep looking each direction
For a spotlight, give me something
I need something for protection
Maybe flotsam junk will do just fine
The jetsam sunk, I'm left behind
I'm treading for my life believe me
(How can I keep up this breathing?)
Not knowing how to think
I scream aloud, begin to sink
My legs and arms are broken down
With envy for the solid ground
I'm reaching for the life within me
How can one man stop his ending?
I thought of just your face
Relaxed, and floated into space

[Chorus]
I want to swim away but don't know how
Sometimes it feels just like I'm falling in the ocean
Let the waves up take me down
Let the hurricane set in motion, yeah
Let the rain of what I feel right now come down
Let the rain come down

[Verse 3]
Now waking to the sun
I calculate what I had done
Like jumping from the bow, yeah
Just to prove that I knew how, yeah
It's midnight's late reminder of
The loss of her, the one I love
My will to quickly end it all
Set front row in my need to fall
Into the ocean, end it all
Into the ocean, end it all
Into the ocean, end it all
Into the ocean, end it all

Into the ocean (goodbye), end it all (goodbye)
Into the ocean (goodbye), end it all (goodbye)

320,Stupid Boy,"[Verse 1]
Well, she was precious like a flower
She grew wild, wild, but innocent
A perfect prayer in a desperate hour
She was everything beautiful and different

[Pre-Chorus]
Stupid boy, you can't fence that in
Stupid boy, it's like holding back the wind

[Chorus]
She laid her heart and soul right in your hands
And you stole her every dream and you crushed her plans
She never even knew she had a choice
And that's what happens when the only voice she hears is telling her she can't
Stupid boy
Stupid boy, oh

[Verse 2]
So what made you think you could take a life
And just push it, push it around
I guess to build yourself up so high
You had to take her and break her down

[Chorus]
Stupid boy, you can't fence that in
Stupid boy, it's like holding back the wind
She laid her heart and soul right in your hands
And you stole her every dream and you crushed her plans
She never even knew she had a choice
And that's what happens when the only voice she hears is telling her she can't
You stupid boy

Oh, you always had to be right
But now you've lost the only thing that ever made you feel alive

321,Ladies Love Country Boys,"[Intro]
This is for all you sophisticated ladies out there

[Verse 1]
She grew up in the city in a little subdivision
Her daddy wore a tie, mama never fried a chicken
Ballet, straight-As, most likely to succeed
They bought her a car after graduation
Sent her down South for some higher education
Put her on the fast track to a Law Degree
Now she's coming home to visit
Holding the hand of a wild-eyed boy
With a farmers tan

Shes riding in the middle of his pickup truck
Blaring Charlie Daniels, yelling, Turn it up!
They raised her up a lady, but there's one thing
They couldn't avoid
Ladies love country boys

[Verse 2]
You know mamas and daddies want better for their daughters
Hope they'll settle down with a doctor or a lawyer
And their uptown, ball gown, hand-me-down royalty
They never understand why their princess falls
For some camouflage britches and a southern-boy-drawl

[Chorus]
She's riding in the middle of his pickup truck
Blaring Hank Jr., yelling, turn it up
They raised her up a lady, but there's one thing
They couldn't avoid, ladies love country boys

You can train them, you can try to teach them
Right from wrong but its still going to turn them on

Felt the wind hit my face
Before my shoot opened I felt my heart race
I was fallin
Oh that's just fallin

Off the coast of australia
I dove way down deep
For all that I saw of that Great Barrier Reef
It was nothin
Compared to you it was nothin

I got lightning in my vains
Thunder in my chest
All tangled up with you and tryin to catch my breath
I've been chasing that sensation half way
Around the world and lookin' back
On what we had
I've done it all I've seen it all but
I can't find a feelin' like that

I wound up in some town in spain
Runnin with the bulls
Tryin to catch another thrill with a thousand other fools
We were runnin
Ah but thats just runnin
When I started pushin 30
It started pushin back

Well how was I to know till now you'd be such a hard act to follow
Nothin seems to follow

I got lightning in my vains
Thunder in my chest
All tangled up with you and tryin to catch my breath
I've been chasing that sinsation half way
Around the world and lookin' back
On what we had
I've done it all I've seen it all but
I can't find a feelin' like that

It's like flyin down some back road at midnight
With you eyes closed and the head lights off
Your life is searchin everywhere can't find that feelin anywhere
Your all I want, now all I want is that...

Lightning in my vains
Thunder in my chest
All tangled up with you and tryin to catch my breath
I've been chasing that sensation half way
Around the world and looin back

[Snoop Dogg]
Money in the air as mo’ fell
Grab you by your coattail, take you to the motel
Ho sale; don’t tell, won't tell
Baby say “I don’t talk, Dogg unless you told on me” - oh well
Take a picture wit me, what the flick gon’ do
Baby stick to me and I’ma stick on you
If you pick me then I’ma pick on you
D-O double G and I’m here to put this dick on you
I'm stuck on pussy and your’s is right
Rip ridin’ the poles and them doors is tight
And I’ma get me a shot ‘fo the end of the night
Cause pussy is pussy and baby you’re pussy for life

Shorty, I can see you ain’t lonely
Handful of niggease and they all got cheese
See you lookin’ at me now what its gon’ be
Just another tease far as I can see
Tryna get you up out this club
If it means spendin' a couple dubs
Throwin’ bout 30 stacks in the back make it rain like that
'Cause I'm far from a scrub
And you know my pedigree
Ex-deala use to move amphetamines
Girl I spend money like it don’t mean nothing and besides I got a thing for you

I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know

I wanna love you... you already know, girl

[Snoop Dogg]
Mobbin' through the club and I’m low pressin’
I’m sittin’ in the back in the smoker’s section (just smokin’)
Birds eye, I got a clear view
You can’t see me, but I can see you (baby I see you)
Hmm, it’s cool, we jet, the mood is set, your pussy is wet
You’re rubbin’ your back and touchin’ your neck
Your body is movin', you humpin' and jumpin'
Your titties is bouncin', you smilin' and grinnin' and lookin’ at me

[Akon]
Girl and while your lookin' at me I’m ready to hit the caddy
Right up on the patio move the patty to the caddy
Baby you got a phatty, the type I like to marry
Wantin’ to just give you everything and that’s kinda scary
Cause I'm loving the way you shake your ass
Bouncin', got me tippin' my glass
Normally don’t get caught up too fast
But I got a thing for you

I see the one, could she be that lady? Ayy

[Chorus: Akon]
I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow

Upfront style, ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the 'Lac down
Konvict's got the whole thing packed now
Step in the club and wardrobe intact now
I feel it, dawnin' cracked now
Ooh, I see it dull and backed now
I'ma call her, then I put the mack down
Money no problem, pocket full of that now

Oh, looks like another club banger
They better hang on when they throw this thang on
Get a little drink on, they gon' flip
For this Akon shit, you can bank on it
Pedicure, manicure, kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Lookin' like one of them Putty-Cat Dolls
Tryin' to hold my woodie back through my drawers
Steps upstage, didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me, and she's like ""You're —""
I'm like, ""I know, let's cut to the chase""
No time to waste, back to my place
Plus from the club to the crib, it's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
And plus, I got a pal if your gal is game
In fact, he's the one singin' the song that's playin' (Akon!)

[Chorus: Akon]
I feel you creepin', I can you see from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?

328,Waiting On The World To Change,"[Verse 1]
Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing and
There's no way we ever could
Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it

[Chorus]
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change

[Verse 2]
Now if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
But when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
Because when they own the information, oh
They can bend it all they want

[Chorus]
That's why we're waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
It's not that we don't care
We just know that the fight isn't fair
So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
And we're still waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting, waiting on the world to change
One day our generation
Is going to rule the population
So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

Feeling the world go against us
So we put the world on our shoulders

We just posted, getting crazy, living like this is so amazing
Hold up, take a step back when we roll up cause I know what
We been loyal, we been fam, we the ones you trust in
Won't hesitate to go straight to your head like a concussion

No hesitation, through my scope I see my enemy

Uhh, devoted to destruction
A full dosage of detrimental dysfunction
I'm dying slow but the devil tryna rush me
See, I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy
Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat
Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat
Eating peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast
And if I get stung, I get stoked, might choke
Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal, naked in the North Pole
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
So I don't fear shit but tomorrow
And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nuttin' but pain
You just fuckin' complain, you ain't tough as you claim
Just stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne
I'ma jump from my plane or stand in front of a train
'Cause I'm a sucker for pain

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
Used to doing bad now we feel like we just now getting it
Ain't got no other way so we start it and finish it
No pain, no gain
Never stand down, made our own way
Never going slow, we pick up the pace
This is what we wanted from a young age
No emotion, that's what business is
Lord have mercy on the witnesses

334,Que Hiciste,"[Verse 1]
Ayer los dos soñábamos con un mundo perfecto
Ayer a nuestros labios les sobraban las palabras
Porque en los ojos nos espiábamos el alma
Y la verdad no vacilaba en tu mirada
Ayer nos prometimos conquistar el mundo entero
Ayer tú me juraste que este amor seria eterno
Por que una vez equivocarse es suficiente
Para aprender lo que es amar sinceramente

[Chorus]
Qué Hiciste? Nos obligaste a destruir las madrugadas
Y nuestras noches las ahogaron tus palabras
Mis ilusiones acabaron con tus falsas
Se te olvido que era el amor lo que importaba
Y con tus manos derrumbaste nuestra casa

[Verse 2]
Mañana que amanezca un día nuevo en mi universo
Mañana no veré tu nombre escrito entre mis versos
No escuchare palabras de arrepentimiento
Ignorare sin pena tu remordimiento
Mañana olvidare que ayer yo fui tu fiel amante
Mañana ni siquiera habrá razones para odiarte
Yo borrare todos tus sueños de mis sueños
Que el viento arrastre para siempre tus recuerdos

[Pre-Chorus]
Qué Hiciste? Hoy destruiste con tu orgullo la esperanza
Hoy empañaste con tu furia mi mirada
Borraste toda nuestra historia con tu rabia
Y confundiste tanto amor que te entregaba
Como permiso para así romperme el alma

Qué Hiciste? Nos obligaste a destruir las madrugadas
Y nuestras noches las ahogaron tus palabras

335,The River,"[Harmonica intro]

[Verse 1]
I come from down in the valley
Where, mister, when you're young
They bring you up to do like your daddy done
Me and Mary we met in high school
When she was just seventeen
We'd ride out of this valley down to where the fields were green

[Chorus 1]
We'd go down to the river
And into the river we'd dive
Oh, down to the river we'd ride

[Verse 2]
Then I got Mary pregnant
And man, that was all she wrote
And for my nineteenth birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat
We went down to the courthouse
And the judge put it all to rest
No wedding day smiles, no walk down the aisle
No flowers, no wedding dress

[Chorus 2]
That night we went down to the river
And into the river we'd dive
Oh, down to the river we did ride
Ah-yah

[Harmonica solo]

[Verse 3]
I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company
But lately there ain't been much work on account of the economy
Now all them things that seemed so important
Well, mister, they vanished right into the air
Now I just act like I don't remember
Mary acts like she don't care

[Bridge]
But I remember us riding in my brother's car
Her body tan and wet down at the reservoir
At night on them banks I'd lie awake
And pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take
Now those memories come back to haunt me
They haunt me like a curse
Is a dream a lie if it don't come true
Or is it something worse

[Chorus 3]
That sends me down to the river
Though I know the river is dry
That sends me down to the river tonight
Ah-yah-yah
Down to the river
My baby and I
Oh, down to the river we ride
Ah-yah-ay

[Ad-libs]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

There you see her
Sitting there across the way
She don't got a lot to say
But there's something about her
And you don't know why
But you're dying to try
You want to kiss the girl
Yes, you want her
Look at her, you know you do
It's possible she wants you too
There's one way to ask her
It don't take a word, not a single word
Go on and kiss the girl (kiss the girl)

Floating in a blue lagoon

No time will be better
She don't say a word
And she won't say a word

[Intro]
I wear a mean dark pair of shades
And you can't see my eyes
Unless my head is bent, you dig

[Hook]
We fly high, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Foreign rides outside, it's like showbiz (we in the building)
We stay fly, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused

[Verse 1]
Ya boy gettin' paper (money), I buy big cars (foreign)
I need fly rides to drive in my garage (choose one!)
Stay sky high, twisted, fly with the stars (twinkle, twinkle)
G4 Flights, 80 grand large (ballin'!)
So we lean with it, pop with it (Bankhead)
'Vertible Jones, mean with the top missin' (flossin'!)
I'm sittin' clean with the bottom kitted (do it!)
I hopped out saggy jeans and my rock glistenin' (ballin'!)
But I spent 'bout 8 grand
Mami on stage doin' the rain dance (I think she like me)
She let it hit the floor, made it pop (what else?)
Got my pedal to the floor screamin', ""Fuck the cops!""

[Hook]
We fly high, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Foreign rides outside, it's like showbiz (we in the building)
We stay fly, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)

[Verse 2]
Slow down, tonight may be gone tomorrow (one chance)
So I speed through life like there's no tomorrow (speedin'!)
100 G's worth of ice on the Audemars (flossin'!)
And we in the street life 'til they call the law (ballin'!)
I made the whip get naked (what happened?)
While I switch gears, bitch lookin' at the bracelet
Step out, show me what you all about
Flashbacks of last night of me ballin' out (Harlem!)
1 AM we was at the club (what happened?)
2 AM: ten bottles of bub (money ain't a thing)
And 'bout 3-somethin' I was thinkin' 'bout grub
So I stumbled to the car, threw the drinks and the drugs (twisted)

[Hook]
We fly high, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Foreign rides outside, it's like showbiz (we in the building)
We stay fly, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused

[Verse 3]
Nigga, could you buy that? I keep 20 in the pocket (light change)
Talk a buck 80 if the Bentley is the topic (that Grey Poupon)
But of course got a Flying Spur
To the hood to roll dice on the side of the curb
But I know a G a bet may sound absurd (get your money up!)
Drive 80 up Lenox 'cause I got a urge (speedin'!)
The rap game like the crack game
Lifestyles, rich and famous, livin' in the fast lane (ballin'!)
So when I bleep, shorty bleep back
Lou' Vuitton belt where I'ma keep all the heat strapped
I beat the trial over Rucker (let's do it!)
All guns loaded and I'm back, motherfucker (Dipset)

339,Year 3000,"[Verse 1: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
One day, when I came home at lunchtime
I heard a funny noise
Went out to the backyard to find out if it was
One of those rowdy boys
Stood there with my neighbor called Peter
And a Flux Capacitor

[Pre-Chorus 1: Nick Jonas]
He told me he built a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen, yeah

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
He said, I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine, doing fine

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
He took me to the future in the flux thing
And I saw everything
Boy bands, and another one, and another one
And another one
Girls there with round hair like Star Wars
Float above the floor

[Pre-Chorus 2: Nick Jonas]
We drove around in a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen, yeah, woo

He said, I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter

340,Say OK,"[Verse 1]
You are fine, you are sweet
But I'm still a bit naive with my heart
When you're close, I don't breathe
I can't find the words to speak
I feel sparks

But I don't want to be into you if you're not looking for true love
No, I don't wanna start seeing you if I can't be your only one
So, tell me...

When it's not okay, will you try to make me feel better?
Will you say alright?
Will you say OK?
Will you stick with me through whatever, or run away?

Say that it's gonna be alright
That it's gonna be okay

When you call, I don't know if I should pick up the phone every time
I'm not like all my friends, who keep calling up the boys
I'm so shy

But I don't wanna be into you if you don't treat me the right way
See, I can only start seeing you if you can make my heart feel safe

341,Release,"[Verse 1]
There's a place I go to
Where no one knows me
It's not lonely
It's a necessary thing
It's a place I made up
Find out what I'm made of
The nights I've stayed up
Counting stars and fighting sleep

[Pre-Chorus]
Let it wash over me
Ready to lose my feet
Take me off to the place where one reviews life's mystery
Steady on down the line
Lose every sense of time
Take it all in and wake up that small part of me
Day to day I'm blind to see
And find how far
To go

[Chorus]
Everybody got their reason
Everybody got their way
We're just catching and releasing
What builds up throughout the day
It gets into your body
And it flows right through your blood
We can tell each other secrets
And remember how to love

(There's a place I'm going)
(Find out what I'm made of)

[Verse 2]
There's a place I'm going
No one knows me
If I breathe real slowly
Let it out and let it in
They can be terrifying
To be slowly dying
Also clarifying
We end where we begin

[Pre-Chorus]
So let it wash over me
I'm ready to lose my feet
Take me off to the place where one reviews life's mystery
Steady on down the line
Lose every sense of time
Take it all in and wake up that small part of me
Day to day I'm blind to see
And find how far
To go

And it flows right through your blood

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Now little Lisa's only nine years old
She's tryin to figure out why the world is so cold
Why she's all alone and they never met her family
Momma's always gone and she never met her daddy
Part of her is missin and nobody'll listen
Momma's on drugs gettin high up in the kitchen
Bringin home men at different hours of the night
Startin with some laughs, usually endin in a fight
Sneakin in her room when her momma's knocked out
Tryin to have his way and little Lisa says ouch
She tries to resist but then all he does is beat her
Tries to tell her mom but her momma don't believe her
Lisa's stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get some clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and never come back (Like this)

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Little Nicole is only ten years old
She's steady tryin to figure why the world is so cold
Why she's not pretty and nobody seems to like her
Alcoholic stepdad always wanna strike her
Yells and abuses, leaves her with some bruises
Teachers ask questions, she's makin up excuses
Bleedin on the inside, cryin on the out
It's only one girl really knows what she's about
Her name is little Stacy and they become friends
Promise that they'll always be tight 'til the end
Until one day lil' Stacy gets shot
A drive-by bullet went stray up on her block
Now Nicole's stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get her clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and NEVER come back

Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Little Erica is eleven years old
She's steady tryin to figure why the world is so cold
So she pops X to get rid of all the pain
Plus she's havin sex with her boy who's sixteen
Emotions run deep as she thinks she's in love
So there's no protection, he's usin no glove
Never thinkin 'bout the consequences of her actions
Livin for today and not tomorrow's satisfaction
The days go by and her belly gets big
The father bails out, he ain't ready for a kid
Knowin her momma would blow it all out of proportion
Plus she lives poor so no money for abortion
Erica is stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get her clothes and pack
She says she 'bout to run away and NEVER come back, ah!

346,Wouldn't Get Far,"[Produced by Kanye West]

[Verse 1: The Game]
I done been around the world, been around the block
Been around hoes that fucked Biggie and 'Pac
Like Vida Guerra, ass took her to the top
She'll give you some brain, you let her throw up the Roc
Let her put on your chain, she'll throw you some cot
Picture that, like Meagan Good and Jamie Foxx
Hype said it's a wrap, she still on the set
Puttin' oil on her legs like she Gloria Velez
She was Eye Candy in the XXL
Hopped off the page and on a skateboard with Pharrell
I knew she wouldn't get far cause five hundred dollars
Can't get you that far, how you get that far
And all these new video bitches tryin to be Melyssa Ford
But they don't know Melyssa Ford drive a Honda Accord
She a video vixen, but behind closed doors
She do whatever it take to get to the Grammy Awards, ha ha

[Hook: The Game + Pam Sawyer]
You wouldn't get far, fuckin' them rap stars
You know who you are, put your hands up ladies
You wouldn't get far, if you kept your legs closed
It would be just a waste of time
But you know, you wouldn't get far, fuckin' them rap stars
You know who you are, I wrote this song for you
For you baby, I'd find you, for you and you, for all y'all

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Pop quiz, how many topless, black foxes
Did I have under my belt, like boxers
Not to brag but, if it add up
One, two... nigga that's mad nuts
Game you mad nuts, how you gon' call out all these
Bitches knowin' damn well they gon' call me
The only dream, of that ghetto prom queen
Was to make it to the screen, maybe get seen
Maybe get chose by a nigga from my team
Head so good he don't ask for a pre... nup
Now ask yourself this question, umm
Would you be with Jay-Z if he wasn't C-E-O
Would you be with F-A-B-O if he drove a Neo
Would you ride with Ne-Yo, if he was in a Geo
Well why the hell you think these bitches comin' at me fo'
But since they all fall in my Palm, I take a trio, yo

[Hook: The Game]
You wouldn't get far, fuckin' them rap stars
You know who you are, put your hands up ladies
You wouldn't get far, if you kept your legs closed
It would be just a waste of time
But you know, you wouldn't get far, fuckin' them rap stars
You know who you are, I wrote this song for you
For you baby, I'd find you, for you and you, for all y'all

[Verse 3: The Game]
I done had my share of bitches with long hair
Short do like Kelis or Halle in Boomerang, yeah
I been around the block in the Bentley drop top
In Miami Beach when Lil' Kim was fuckin with Scott
I got the scoop on Hoops, whatever the case
She'll let you spray in her face long as she Bathing Apes
And ain't nobody tryin' to take Beyonce from Jay
But I know a bitch named Superhead he fucked back in the day
The things niggas do when pussy sittin' on they face
Stabbed Un in the stomach
She must have had a pussy like Wonder Woman
On that superhero shit
Fly as Gabrielle Union in the back of my six, fo'
Impala, forget the double D's
I put 'em right in your face like that model bitch Toccara
And she ain't win the show but she ridin' in that Gallardo
That's why I fuck 'em today and forget 'em tomorrow

[Hook: The Game]
You wouldn't get far, fuckin' them rap stars
You know who you are, put your hands up ladies
You wouldn't get far, if you kept your legs closed
It would be just a waste of time
But you know, you wouldn't get far, fuckin' them rap stars
You know who you are, I wrote this song for you
For you baby, I'd find you, for you and you, for all y'all

[Outro - The Game]
God damn, you know what I'm sayin'
I'm sittin' back watchin' Kanye video
And I see the same bitch
That was in the homeboy Busta Rhymes video
Then I flip the muh'fuckin channel
Checkin' out my uncle Snoop Dogg video
And I see the same bitch, that was in my video
You know what I'm sayin'
And then y'knahmsayin, to make that even mo' fucked up
I'm watchin Oprah cover Hurricane Katrina
I see the same bitch on Oprah
Floatin away on the hood of a Camry
That was in the nigga Lil Weezy video
I mean damn, everywhere I look
Everywhere I go, I see the same hoes
Don't get mad, I'm only bein' real, yeah",The Game,2007,"[93, 82, 64, 68, 68, 70, 72, 73, 92]",9

Shake it up

[Verse 1]
I never loved nobody fully
Always one foot on the ground
And by protecting my heart truly
I got lost in the sounds

Suppose I never ever met you
Suppose we never fell in love
Suppose I never ever let you
Kiss me so sweet and so soft
Suppose I never ever saw you
Suppose you never ever called
Suppose I kept on singing love songs
Just to break my own fall

Just to break my fall
Just to break my fall
Just to break my fall
Break my fall, break my fall

Well, just because she feeds me well
And she made me talk dirty in a pink hotel
It doesn't mean she's got eyes for me
She might just want my bones, you see
And hey flathead, don't you get mean
She's the second best killer that I ever have seen
They don't come much more sick than you
I could go on if you want me to
It's just so wrong, so very nice
And I told you once and you killed me twice
I saw you one time at the back of the club
Chewing on glass and a ticket stub

Well, everybody knows you're the one to call
When the girls get ugly at the back of the wall
Josephine says you're a bleeding nose
So taking it with her wherever she goes
Hey flathead, don't check me in
Well hers is a tonic and mine is a gin
They don't come much more slick that you
I'd drive your car if you ask me to

So he stood and got a kicking instead, 'til she said

366,Alyssa Lies,"My little girl met a new friend just the other day
On the playground at school
Between the tires and the swings
But she came home with tear-filled eyes
And she said to me ""Daddy, Alyssa Lies""

Well, I just brushed it off at first
Cause I didn't know how much my little girl had been hurt
Or the things she had seen
I wasn't ready when I said, ""You can tell me.""
And she said

[Chorus]
Alyssa lies to the classroom...
Alyssa lies everyday at school!
Alyssa lies to the teachers
As she tries to cover every bruise

My little girl laid her head down
That night to go to sleep
As I stepped out the room I heard her say
A prayer so soft and sweet:
""God bless my mom and my dad
And my new friend Alyssa
Oh, I know she needs you bad
Because

[Chorus]
Alyssa lies to the classroom
Alyssa lies everyday at school
Alyssa lies to the teachers
As she tries to cover every bruise

I had the worst night of sleep in years
As I tried to think of a way to calm her fears
I knew exactly what I had to do
But when we got to school on Monday...I heard the news

My little girl asked me why everybody looked so sad
The lump in my throat grew bigger with every question that she asked
Until I felt the tears run down my face
And I told her that Alyssa wouldn't be at school today

Cause she doesn't lie in the classroom
She doesn't lie anymore at school
Alyssa lies with Jesus
Because there's nothing anyone would do...

Tears filled my eyes
When my little girl asked me why
Alyssa lies
Oh, daddy
Oh, daddy
Tell me why...

367,Not Ready To Make Nice,"Forgive, sounds good
Forget, I'm not sure I could
They say time heals everything
But I'm still waiting
I'm through with doubt
There’s nothing left for me to figure out
I've paid a price
And I'll keep paying
I’m not ready to make nice
I’m not ready to back down
I’m still mad as hell and
I don't have time to go round and round and round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn’t if I could
‘Cause I'm mad as hell
Can't bring myself to do what it is you think I should
I know you said
Can't you just get over it
It turned my whole world around
And I kind of like it
I made my bed and I sleep like a baby
With no regrets and I don’t mind sayin'
It’s a sad sad story when a mother will teach her
Daughter that she ought to hate a perfect stranger
And how in the world can the words that I said
Send somebody so over the edge
That they’d write me a letter
Sayin’ that I better shut up and sing
Or my life will be over
I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell and
I don’t have time to go round and round and round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn’t if I could
‘Cause I'm mad as hell
Can't bring myself to do what it is you think I should
I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell and
I don’t have time to go round and round and round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
‘Cause I'm mad as hell
Can't bring myself to do what it is you think I should
What it is you think I should

368,Welcome To The Black Parade,"When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned?""

He said, ""Will you defeat them?
Your demons and all the non-believers
The plans that they have made?
Because one day, I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer
To join the black parade""

When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned?""

Sometimes I get the feeling
She's watching over me
And other times I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall
The bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know

We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And in my heart, I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it

And while that sends you reeling
From decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back
And let's shout out loud and clear
Defiant to the end we hear the call

To carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

On and on we carry through the fears (Oh, oh, oh)
Disappointed faces of your peers (Oh, oh, oh)
Take a look at me
'Cause I could not care at all

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part

I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scar
Give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here because it's who we are

I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy who had to sing this song
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
I don't care

We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, you'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches on

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
(We'll carry on)

370,Nothing Left To Lose,"[Verse]
Happy birthday kid, now go ahead and make a wish
For everything that's old and gray to turn back to new again
Happy birthday friend, let's raise a glass for what's ahead
For all the nights that never end, ""let's raise a couple more"", I said
Happy birthday me, I'm spilling over everything
We drank away the drinks for free, they always seem to follow me
Happy birthday you, the trouble we could get into
When I got nothing else to do, and you got nothing left to lose

[Chorus]
Let's go and bury our conditions
With sex and alcohol and songs with our friends
You call it crazy, it's all that we've ever been
We're making everything old feel new again

[Verse]
Happy birthday kid, tonight we're taking off the edge
Slow down and tell me what you did, so tell me everything
Happy birthday, well I think we got enough for bail
I think we do but I can't tell, we'll probably spend the night in jail
Happy birthday me, I drank away the memories
Do you remember 21? I don't remember 17
Happy birthday you, the trouble we could get into
When you got nothing else to do, and I got nothing left to lose

[Chorus]
Let's go and bury our conditions
With sex and alcohol and songs with our friends
You call it crazy, it's all that we've ever been
We're making everything old feel new again

Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but can't complete
Listen to the sound from deep within
It's only beginning to find release

Oh the time has come for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen

Listen, I am alone at a crossroads

And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known, oh
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what
You've made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own
You should have listened

There was someone here inside
Someone I thought had died
So long ago

Yeah, you gonna remember me, boo
I'm gonna remember you too
I can't forget all the crazy shit we used to do
You was doing too much, I wasn't doing enough
That's what your friends are saying, you got a man anyway
I can't explain it either, I ain't never wanna leave ya
Hell yeah, it's hard to walk away when I see ya
When I see ya I remember the day
You put your shoes on and moved on before I could say...

[Verse 2: Paula DeAnda]
I saw you with your new girl just yesterday
And I feel that I must confess
Even though it kills me to have to say
I'll admit that I was impressed
Physically just short of perfection
Gotta commend you on your selection
Though I know I shouldn't be concerned
In the back of my mind, I can't help but question
Does she rub your feet? (When you've had a long day)
Scratch your scalp? (When you take out your braids)
Does she know that you like to play PS2 'til 6 in the morning like I do?

I can't explain this feeling (Yeah)
I think about it every day
And even though we've moved on (Uh-huh)

Walk away (Forever you will live in my memory)
Walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
Walk away (I can't forget how we used to be)

[Verse 3: Paula DeAnda]
Guess I gotta live my life from day to day
Hoping maybe you'll come back
And though I tell myself not to be afraid
To move on, but it seems I can't
Though a new man has given me attention
It ain't the same as your affection
Though I know I should be content
In the back of my mind, I can't help but question
Does he kiss me on the forehead? (Before we play)
Show up on my doorstep? (With a bouquet)
Does he call me in the middle of the day just to say, ""Baby, I love you"" (Like you used to?)

[Chorus: Paula DeAnda & Divine]
I can't explain this feeling (Yeah)
I think about it every day
And even though we've moved on (Uh-huh)

Walk away (Forever you will live in my memory)
Walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
Walk away (I can't forget how we used to be)

[Verse 4: Divine, Paula DeAnda, Both]
I'm gonna remember you (You're gonna remember me)
The things we did, the way we shared our fantasies
Just you and me; my friend, my love, my family
How did we lose a love that seemed meant to be?
Sometimes I kiss her and wish that it was you I'm kissing
Sometimes I miss him and wish that it was you I'm missing
Sometimes I hug her and wish that it was you I was hugging
And I realize how much I'm bugging
I miss you

[Bridge: Paula DeAnda & Divine]
So hard to express this feeling
'Cause nobody compares to you (To you)
And you know she'll never love you like I do (Yeah)

Wait 'til I get my money right

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man it's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given, much is tested
Get arrested guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do? Act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry, more Louis V
My mama couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel man
I ain't one of the Cosby's, I ain't go to Hillman
I guess the money should've changed him
I guess I should've forgot where I came from

Let up the suicide doors
This is my life homie, you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldn't tell ya who decide wars
So I parallel double parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking 'bout, ""Back in my day""
But homie this is my day
Class started 2 hours ago, oh am I late?
No, I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh they so sensitive
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon' end up apolog'ing
Let me know if it's a problem then, aight man, holla then

If he can move through the rumors, he can drive off of fumes 'cause
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure, what's your pleasure?
Life is a, UH, depending how you dress her
So if the Devil wear Prada, Adam Eve wear nada
I'm in between but way more fresher
With way less effort, 'cause when you try hard
That's when you die hard
Your homies looking like why God
When they reminisce over you, my God

[Hook: Kanye (w/ Young Jeezy)]
La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Outro: Kanye (w/ Young Jeezy)]
La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get my money right

Then you can't tell me nothing, right?

378,Movin' On,"[Music Video]

[Verse 1: Camila & Lauren]
I'm breaking down, gonna start from scratch
Shake it off like an etch-a-sketch
My lips are saying good-bye
My eyes are finally dry
I'm not the way that I used to be
I took the record off repeat
It killed me, but I survived
And now I'm coming alive

[Pre-Chorus: Camila]
I'll never be that girl again, no-oh-oh
I'll never be that girl again, no-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Lauren]
My innocence is wearing thin
But my heart is growing strong
So call me, call me, call me
Miss movin' on, oh-oh-oh
Miss movin' on, oh-oh-oh, yeah

[Verse 2: Lauren & Dinah & (Normani)]
I broke the glass that surrounded me (surrounded me)
I ain't the way you remember me (remember me)
I was such a good girl
So fragile but no more
I jumped the fence to the other side, (the other side)
My whole world was electrified (electrified)
Now I'm now longer afraid
It's Independence Day
(It's Independence Day)

[Pre-Chorus: Camila]
I'll never be that girl again, no-oh-oh
I'll never be that girl again, no-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Lauren]
My innocence is wearing thin
But my heart is growing strong
So call me, call me, call me
Miss movin' on

[Bridge: Dinah & (Normani)]
Everything is changing
And I never want to go back
To the way it was (the way it was)
I'm finding out who I am and who I am
From here on out is gonna be enough (gonna be enough)
Is gonna be enough...

[Pre-Chorus: Normani & Ally]
I'll never be that girl again, no-oh-oh
I'll never be that girl again, no-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Lauren & (Dinah) & (Ally) & (Camila) & Normani]
My innocence is wearing thin
But my heart is growing strong
So call me, call me, call me
Miss movin' on, oh-oh-oh (ohhhhh)
Miss movin' on, oh-oh-oh (on and on and on and on and on)
Miss movin' on, oh-oh-oh (on and on and on and on, on and on and on and on)
Miss movin' on, oh-oh-oh (hey... yeah yeah)

379,The Neighbor,"[Produced by No I.D.]

[Intro: James Fauntleroy]
Thousand lives ago, we were young and we didn't know
We were trading our crowns for our souls
Made the sacrifice, headed back to the light
But be careful don't drown in the gold
I know it glows but it's cold

[Sample]
I'm from the other side of town, out of bounds
To anybody who don't live around
I never learned to share or how to care
I never had no teachings about being fair

[Verse 1: Common]
Have you ever heard of Black Stone around Black Stones?
And Four CHs, Vice Lords, Stony Island on Aces
The concrete matrix, street organizations
They gave violations, hood public relations
It was the basics to get big faces
Stay away from cases, bad broads, good graces
The hustlers was the taste makers and trend setters
They the ones that fed us hopin' that the feds don't get us
The era of Reagan, the terror of Bush
Crack babies, momma's a push, we were the products of Bush
I'm wishin' for a Samurai Suzuki and a little Gucci
A bad ho to bee-bee-bee do me, you heard of Flukey
Stokes, it was folks and coke and dope
Fiends choked off of smoke, herringbones and rope
Rare jewels of a generation
Diamonds, blinding us of real shit we facin'
Forties wasted on 'ceased, Dion makin' the beats
When they air it out on at the parties we escapin' the heat
I could break it down like whatever you need
He squinted his face and rolled the weed

[Interlude]
You know they don't see sometimes that in the neighborhood, it's the exact same thing. It's the same thing over and over again. Feel me?

[Verse 2: G Herbo]
Have you ever heard of no limit, three hundred, six hundred?
Folly boy, O block, eastside
Where it ain't no conversation they just let them heats ride
Can't nobody stop the violence, why my city keep lyin'?
Niggas throw up peace signs but everybody keep dying
Used to post up on that strip, I look like a street sign
I've been out there three days and I got shot at three times
Felt like every bullet hit me when they flew out each nine
I be happy when I wake up and I have a free mind
I know haters wanna clap me up, watch the morgue grab me up
But they can catch me later, I been cool, chasin' paper
Where I come from ain't no hope if you was claimin' that was major
Small crib, big fam, mom was workin', granny raised us
No food in the refrigerator, I was bangin', pullin' capers, that's real shit
Same niggas from day one boy, yeah I'm still with
Better watch out for that jump shot cause they will hit
Homie take your shorty lunchbox, and won't feel shit
I came from a place where it's basic but you won't make it
Feds buildin' cases, judges who racist and full of hatred I mean
You ain't never seen the shit that I seen

381,That's That,"[Verse]
Already woke, spared a joke, barely spoke, rarely smoke
Stared at folks when properly provoked, mirror broke
Here, share strawberry morning, gone an more important spawning
Torn in, poor men sworn in
Cornish hens switching positions, auditioning morticians
Saw it in a vision, ignoring prison
Ignoramuses enlist and sound dumb
Found 'em drowned in cow's dung, crowns flung
Rings a Tinkerbell, sing for things that's frail as a fingernail
Bring a scale, stale ginger lingers
Seven figures invigor
Nigga, fresh from out the jail, alpha male
Sickest ninja injury this century, enter plea
Lend sympathy to limper Simple Simon rhyming emcees
Trees is free, please leave a key
These meagre fleas, he's the breeze
And she's the bees knees for sheez
G's of G's
Seize property, shopper sprees, chop the cheese
Drop the grease to stop diseases, gee wiz pa!
DOOM rock grammar like the kumbaya
Mama was a ho hopper, papa was a Rolling Stone star like Obama
Pull a card like oh drama
Civil liberties
These little titties abilities riddle me, middle C
Give a MC a rectal hysterectomy
Lecture on removal of the bowels, foul technically
Don't expect to see the recipe
Until we receive the check as well as the collection fee
More wreck than Section Z
What you expect to get for free?
Shit from me, history
The key, plucked it off the mayor
Chucked it in the ol' tar pit off La Brea, player
They say he's gone too far
DOOM'll catch em after Jumah on cue lacka!!
Do whatcha gotta do, grarrrr
The rumors are not true, got two ma
No prob, got the job, hot-barred heart throb
Scotchguard the bar with cotton swabs, dart lob
Bake a cake, sweet
Jamaica trade in treats on the beach
Make her skeet til her feets meet

Can it be I stayed away too long?
Did you miss these rhymes when I was gone?
As you listen to these crazy tracks
Check them stats then you know where I'm at
And that's that

[Audio Clip: Unknown, Kathleen Turner, Christopher Lloyd]

382,Wind It Up,"[Intro]
High on the hills with the lonely goatherd
Lay-od-lay-od-lay-he-hoo
He yodelled back with the girl and goatherd
Lay-od-lay-od-low

[Chorus]
Wind it up
Wind it up
Wind it up
Wind it up
Yodellay, yodallay, yodel-low (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
This is the key that makes us wind up
When the beat comes on, the girls all line up
And the boys all look, but no, they can't touch
But the girls want to know why boys like us so much
They like way we dance, they like the way we work
They like the way that L.A.M.B. is going 'cross my shirt
They like the way my pants, it compliments my shape (She's crazy, right?)
They like the way we react every time we hear the...

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time the bass bangs, realize it calls your name
Let the beat wind you up, and don't stop 'til your time is up
(Get in line now)

[Chorus]
Wind it up
Wind it up (C'mon)
Wind it up
Yodelay, yodelay, yodal-low

[Verse 2]
You've got to let the beat get under your skin
You've got to open up and let it all in
But see, once it gets in, the popping begins
Then you find out why all the boys stare
See, they're trying to bite our style
Trying to study our approach
They like the way we do it, so original
I guess that they are slow, so they should leave the room
This beat is for the clubs and cars that go

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time the bass bangs, realize it calls your name
Let the beat wind you up, and don't stop 'til your time is up
(Get in line now)

[Chorus]
Wind it up (Whenever you're ready)
Wind it up
Wind it up
Wind it up
Yodelay, yodelay, yodal-low

[Bridge]
(Uh-huh) this is your moment
(Uh-huh) come on girl, you know you own it
(Uh-huh) you know your key is still tick-tocking
(Hell yeah) but you know they're watching
Get it girl, get it, get it girl
Get it girl, get it, get it girl
To the front, to the side, to the back, but don't let him ride
Keep going girl, it's your night
Don't let him steal your light
I know he thinks you're fine and stuff
But does he know how to wind you up? (C'mon)

[Chorus]
Wind it up
Wind it up
Wind it up
Wind it up

I'm from the projects where we all think alike though
And killin' ain't nothin' but a hobby
Don't make me do a fuckin' 1-8-7 robbery
And like some brand new Jordans, you tied up
You sound like a chicken so it's time to get plucked
By a gangsta, keep one up in the chamber
Don't make me wear your ass like some '85 Wranglers
Now you all screwed up like DJ Screw
Don't have my money, nigga fuck you and your boo
Got amphetamines for them dope fiends
Where I'm from a little town called New Orleans
But blowin' up like B-12
Niggas don't give a fuck 'cause they quick to send your ass to hell
The murder capital of the world
Where niggas don't give a fuck about you, your boy, or your girl
And if you come stuntin' on them gold thangs
I'mma have to break you off somethin'

[Chorus: Master P]
Break you off somethin'
Don't make me break you off somethin'
Break you off somethin'
Don't make me break you off somethin'
Break you off somethin'
Don't make me break you off somethin'

[Verse 2: Pimp C]
Let me set the shit straight, let me lay down the rules
If a bitch is talkin' shit, then that bitch gonna have to snooze
Pimp C bitch now what the fuck you said
AK hit the wall tore the stuffin' out the fuckin, bed
I'm lookin' at dead, I'm fully auto
Tommorow I got court, I ain't gonna go
Nigga owe me money, thinkin' it's funny, bought a 64'
I'm 'bout to pull a kickdoe
I need mo money money, mo money money
Took the keys, took the cheese, and fucked his main hunny, hunny
Now the game is escalated, 'cause ain't no witnesses
To go back and tell the Po-Po's all the shit we did
I'm lookin' at rape, I'm lookin' at kidnap
But when them bitches get here you gonna be full of hot caps
I'm breakin' them bitches off, putting 'em in the trunk
Ridin' around P.A bout-it hostages blowin' skunk
'Cause gettin' rid of enemies to me ain't really nothin' nothin'
Pimp C bitch 14-96'll break you off somethin'

[Chorus: Master P]
Break you off somethin'
Don't make me break you off somethin'
Break you off somethin'
Don't make me break you off somethin'
Break you off somethin'
Don't make me break you off somethin'

[Verse 3: Bun B]
We comin' down like a sail, in that goddamn rover
Just when you thought it was the beginnin' you bitch, now it's over
You can call on the cavalry, reinforcements, and your local P-D
They gettin' somewhere if they see me
My nigga that's how these G's be we three, me, C and Master P
Sippin' on Gin and Kiwi
Fuck poppin' in your CD, bitch we poppin' in them clips
And now we all up in your grill live in 3-D
With drama, disaster, and death when you make me have to blast ya'
Y'all has to recognize you fuckin' with murder masters
Who plaster your ass and make your momma call a pastor
Dyin' faster than you thought, now that's your ass bro
It's the class of 9 scrilla on the for real'a
Direct from the villa of killas, now who thinkin' they trilla'
Watch me fill a wanna be cap-peeler with them slugs
Probably for jaw-jackin' and jumpin'
Bitch don't make me break you off somethin' nigga",Master P,2007,[72],1
386,Amarillo Sky,"[Verse 1]
He gets up before the dawn
Packs a lunch and a thermos full of coffee
It's another day in the dusty haze
Those burnin' rays are wearin' down his body
The diesel's worth the price of gold
It's the cheapest grain he's ever sold
But he's still holdin' on

[Chorus]
He just takes the tractor another round
And pulls the plow across the ground
And sends up another prayer
He says, ""Lord, I never complain, I never ask 'Why?'
Please don't let my dreams run dry
Underneath, underneath this Amarillo Sky""

[Verse 2]
That hail storm back in '83
Sure did take a toll on his family
But he stayed strong and carried on
Just like his Dad and Granddad did before him
On his knees every night
He prays, ""Please let my crops and children grow""
'Cause that's all he is ever known

[Chorus]
He just takes the tractor another round
And pulls the plow across the ground
And sends up another prayer
He says, ""Lord, I never complain, I never ask 'Why?'
Please don't let my dreams run dry
Underneath, underneath this Amarillo Sky""

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
And he takes the tractor another round. (Another round)
Another round (Another round), another round
And he takes the tractor another round, another round

Please do not let my dreams run dry
Underneath, underneath this Amarillo Sky""

Welcome to the life of a nice brother
Light skind-ed, black father, white mother
Tried to be a player, found out I'm a slight lover
Come from Carolina, I'm fly, I'm a Wright Brother
Went away to school looking for the right lover
You know, someone that you could cut and never worry 'bout a rubber
She had a man, I be damned, think I might love her
Thought about her ass for the whole damn Summer
Man I even memorized her whole damn number
This is my semester dog, I'm coming to arrest her
Y'all you know, handcuff her, her ex man, fuck him
Oh nah don't be appalled man, that nigga was a dog
So it's me now, and she be everywhere I be now
I wonder, should I tell her what her fella wanna be now?
The dreams I been dreaming and them things I wanna see now
Do that make you wanna leave or would you still hold me down?

Hey, for you I always had an admiration
We lost touch but you never left my imagination
Congratulations on your graduation
Oh now it's time to hit the real world, filled with all them résumés and applications

You say it's cause you a woman and even more cause you black, imagine that
The weight of everything on your plate
You got the world on your back baby, if you can relate, man I feel for you
'Ey has this world got too real for you?
Your old friends say you changed but I still know you
You that same old girl I used to take home from school
Tryna look cool, forgot I had the brake on, damn

A holey pair of jeans

With her brown hair a-blowing

And she's a lover when she's loving

And she's feeling kinda tipsy

She's the giver I wish I could be
And the stealer of the covers
She's a picture in my wallet
And my unborn children's mother

She's the answer to my prayer
And she's the song that I'm playing

But she’s far, far away
And I’d do anything just to see her face
But she’s far, far away
Walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again

Sittin’ on a plane
Reminscing back when I made that mistake
I wish it never ended with a heartbreak
Now your heart broken, tears in ya face
Ask myself why, looking at the sky
If I could turn back I’d make it all right
Praying that you better but its still stormy weather
Don’t wanna let go but the rain won't let up
Now you gone, still thinking bout you everyday
And I know feelings was hurt and you can blame me but
I’m sorry for the games that I played
But now it’s too late
And now she’s…

It’s cold putting up a fight
Arguing back and forth through the night
Regardless what I said I don’t mean most of it
You know I really love you, this the realest goin’ get
It take time to realize what you really wanna know
You was ready for it all but your feelings I ignored
I know my fault, I should’ve gave more
Now you’re miles away and I’m miles on tour
Now it’s drums playing, crowd singing
Life changing, wish you was here to witness all
Now that starts fading
They say two wrongs don’t make it right
And I was wrong and now it ain't right

To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all

I will let you down
I will make you hurt

I'm just too white and nerdy
Really, really white and nerdy

[Verse 1]
First in my class here at MIT
Got skills, I'm a champion at D&D
M.C. Escher—that's my favorite ""M.C.""
Keep your 40, I'll just have an Earl Grey tea
My rims never spin, to the contrary
You'll find that they're quite stationary
All of my action figures are cherry
Stephen Hawking's in my library
My MySpace page is all totally pimped out
Got people beggin' for my Top 8 spaces
Yo, I know pi to a thousand places
Ain't got no grills, but I still wear braces
I order all of my sandwiches with mayonnaise
I'm a whiz at Minesweeper—I could play for days
Once you see my sweet moves, you're gonna stay amazed
My fingers movin' so fast I'll set the place ablaze
There's no killer app  I haven't run
At Pascal, well, I'm number one
Do vector calculus just for fun
I ain't got a gat but I got a soldering gun
""Happy Days"" is my favorite theme song
I could sure kick your butt in a game of ping pong
I'll ace any trivia quiz you bring on
I'm fluent in JavaScript as well as Klingon
(Here's the part I sing on)

[Chorus 2]
They see me roll on my Segway
I know in my heart they think I'm white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Can't you see I'm white and nerdy?
Look at me, I'm white and nerdy
I'd like to roll with the gangstas
Although it's apparent I'm too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
I'm just too white and nerdy
How'd I get so white and nerdy?

[Verse 2]
I've been browsin', inspectin'
X-Men comics, you know I collect 'em
The pens in my pocket, I must protect 'em
My ergonomic keyboard never leaves me bored
Shopping online for deals on some writable media
I edit Wikipedia
I memorized Holy Grail really well
I can recite it right now and have you ""ROTFLOL""
I got a business doing websites
When my friends need some code, who do they call?
I do HTML for 'em all, even made a homepage for my dog, yo
I got myself a fanny pack
They were havin' a sale down at The Gap
Spend my nights with a roll of bubble wrap
Pop, pop, hope no one sees me, gettin' freaky
I'm nerdy in the extreme and whiter than sour cream
I was in AV Club and Glee Club and even the Chess Team
Only question I ever thought was hard
Was do I like Kirk or do I like Picard?
Spend every weekend at the Renaissance Fair
Got my name on my underwear

[Chorus 3]
They see me strollin', they laughin'
And rollin' their eyes 'cause I'm so white and nerdy
Just because I'm white and nerdy
Just because I'm white and nerdy
All because I'm white and nerdy
Holy cow, I'm white and nerdy!
I wanna bowl with the gangstas
But, oh well, it's obvious I'm white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
I'm just too white and nerdy
Look at me, I'm white and nerdy!",“Weird Al” Yankovic,2007,"[74, 76, 65, 59, 48, 34, 19, 44]",8
398,Not Fade Away,"[Verse 1]
I want to tell you how it's going to be
You're going to give your love to me
I want to love you night and day
You know my love will not fade away

You know my love will not fade away
Not fade away

[Verse 2]
My love is bigger than a cadillac
I try to show you but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're going to know just how I feel

Our love is real, not fade away
Not fade away",Grateful Dead,2007,[78],1

You gotta love it

Yea you gotta figure out how to make me feel special

And I'll be good to you
I'll treat you how you need to be treated

And I'll make you feel like OHH MY GOD

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I'm a 360 nigga, 730 all the way dirty
I got that burner on me now, you heard me
Tasted the good life twice, rap and shooting dice
Hell naw, I ain't put my head between her legs
Smelled like a philly wood grain
Bitch I'm balling, in a Bentley continental see bitch I'm hauling
You got to want to win like I want to win and do things my way
If not I'll put your ass out on the highway
I'm a bad judge of character, I know that shit
Man time don't fly when you fuck with the wrong bitch
I mean damn why you come to me bitch
What you want from me bitch
You're like the boogey man, your haunting me bitch
I give you money, you spend that, and come back
Like you need a new stack
I'm puzzled now, how the fuck you blow that
You got a nigga on the side, well you should have him full time
Go fuck up his shit instead of mine

[Bridge: 50 Cent]
Go get, punk bitch
(You got to be good to me)
I don't need you round here, no way
A mufuckin headache, you understand what I'm saying

Look my motherfucking head hurts right now cause of your punk ass
Bitch, why don't you find something constructive to do
(You got to be good to me)
You know, KILL YOUSELF
G-Go on kill yourself
(I'm going be good to you)
Go on to the bathroom, open the cabinet, and eat the pills

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
She loves you when your paper thick
It looks like your making it
In and out the town fresh, Audi R8'ing it
Freak fest, south beach, mardi gras taping it
In the club balling on my party hard take and shit
V.I.P.'ing on her, you ain't even got a place to sit
Smoking piff, you'll cough, every time you take a hit
Well mama got me stuck, look how she shake her hip
She ain't used to this shit but I'm a make it fit
She wants a sex drive, she wants a new one
I'll do you one better, I won't cum 'til you cum
A joint account'll turn one bum to two bums
Dealing with a chick that can't even walk and chew gum
Money don't solve the problems, it prolongs it
You don't want things to get better, you just want shit
Ain't nobody happy bout me and you, they all sick
Bitch you had swagger, but mine reinforced it
Everything you had lost it

[Bridge: 50 Cent]
Man, you should be happy you got rid of that bitch man
(You got to be good to me)
She wasn't even worth the shoes she walked out in
(I'm going be good to you)
I know you want the mufucking shoes back
Them mufuckers were hot man
I ain't going to front
Fin' tell my bitch
(You got to be good to me)
""Man you need to get you a pair of those shoes man, Banks said those things looking good""
(I'm going be good to you)
I'm a real nigga, Tonys that bitch nigga, how much money you got nigga

[Verse 3: Tony Yayo]
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's super nigga
With 5 acres and a mule and the coupe is bigger
You gone trip on that ho, you a stupid nigga
I'm a P.I.M.P. not cupid nigga
Ho pimping all day bitch, this ain't a hobby
My name Tony, not Paul McCartney
I'm in a 7 star suite, Dutchin' my haze
Remote in my hand, model bitch on my mate
Baby girl want Chloe and Fende spars
She wants to fly to L.A. and live like a star
She wants to eat lobster and caviar
But we eat Burger King and we fuck in the car
I'll be far from your friend and your lover
I hit a bitch off, drop her off, and burn rubber
Pull out the rubber, can't get a dime, it's bad enough Uncle Sam trying to take mine
Shiiiiiiitttttttt

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Damn nigga, a bitch can't even get a pair of shoes
(You got to be good to me)
Man you ain't going to be able to keep no bitch like that man
(I'm going be good to you)
I'll tell you, I started out the same way
I mean even in the projects
(You got to be good to me)
Bitch didn't pay attention for all that
Know what I'm talking about

All those games you tried to play
Well, they ain't gonna work on me now
I put a barbed wire fence around my heart, baby
Just to keep you out
Well, you thought I'd wait around forever
But baby, get real
I just kicked you to the curb in my red high heels

[Chorus]
Oh, you can watch me walk if you want to, want to

What is wrong with vanity?

405,One Wing In The Fire,"[Verse 1]
Daddy's been a back-row Baptist
With his share of front-row sin
His Saturday night still on his breath
Every Sunday when he'd walk in
He's never led the Benediction
He's never sang in the choir
But he's an angel with no halo
And one wing in the fire

[Verse 2]
Mama lives by the Bible
The Bible lives by the bed
And she's lied alone so many nights
With scriptures in her head
Praying Good Lord, just be with him
I know his faith is tired
But he's an angel with no halo
And one wing in the fire

[Chorus]
And I know he lives a little left of living right
And he's come close to going way too far a few times
But I'd trade a thousand prayers
If just one prayer would come true
Lord, please believe in him like I believe in you

[Verse 2]
Daddy's always been there for me
From T-Ball to touchdowns
Fixed my car an' fixed my heart
When they've been broken down
I know he calls for more forgiveness
Than most folks do require
But he's an angel with no halo
An' one wing in the fire

[Chorus]
And I know he lives a little left of living right
And he's come close to going way too far a few times
But I'd trade a thousand prayers
If just one prayer would come true
Lord, please believe in him like I believe in you

Well, I just can't imagine
What Heaven might be like

407,Through Glass,"[Chorus]
I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
Oh, God, it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
That forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head
'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
All I know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
That forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head

[Verse 1]
How do you feel? That is the question
But I forget you don't expect an easy answer
When something like a soul becomes initialized and folded up
Like paper dolls and little notes, you can't expect a bit of hope
So while you're outside looking in, describing what you see
Remember what you're staring at is me

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
All I know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
That forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head

[Verse 2]
How much is real? So much to question
An epidemic of the mannequins, contaminating everything
We thought came from the heart, but never did right from the start
Just listen to the noises, null and void instead of voices
Before you tell yourself, it's just a different scene
Remember it's just different from what you've seen

[Chorus]
I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
And all I know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
That forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head
'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
And all I know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
That forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head

[Bridge]
And it's the stars, the stars
That shine for you
And it's the stars, the stars
That lie to you, yeah-ah
And it's the stars, the stars
That shine for you
And it's the stars, the stars
That lie to you, yeah-ah

I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
Oh, God, it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
That forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head
'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
All I know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
That forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head

409,Maneater,"[Verse 1]
She'll only come out at night
The lean and hungry type
Nothing is new
I've seen her here before
Watching and waiting
Ooh, she's sitting with you, but her eyes are on the door
So many have paid to see what you think you're getting for free
The woman is wild, a she-cat tamed by the purr of a Jaguar
Money's the matter
If you're in it for love, you ain't gonna get too far

[Chorus]
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
She's a maneater
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
She's a maneater

[Verse 2]
I wouldn't if I were you
I know what she can do
She's deadly, man
She could really rip your world apart
Mind over matter
Ooh, the beauty is there but a beast is in the heart

[Chorus]
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up
(Oh-oh, here she comes)
She's a maneater

410,My Little Girl,"[Verse 1]
Gotta hold on easy as I let you go
Gonna tell you how much I love you, though you think you already know
I remember I thought you looked like an angel wrapped in pink so soft and warm
You've had me wrapped around your finger since the day you were born

[Chorus]
You're beautiful baby from the outside in
Chase your dreams but always know the road that'll lead you home again
Go on, take on this whole world
But to me you know you'll always be, my little girl

[Verse 2]
When you were in trouble that crooked little smile could melt my heart of stone
Now look at you, I've turned around and you've almost grown
Sometimes you're asleep I whisper ""I Love You!"" in the moonlight at your door
As I walk away, I hear you say, ""Daddy Love You More!""

[Chorus]
You're beautiful baby from the outside in
Chase your dreams but always know the road that'll lead you home again
Go on, take on this whole world
But to me you know you'll always be, my little girl

[Verse 3]
Someday, some boy will come and ask me for your hand
But I won't say ""yes"" to him unless I know, he's the half
That makes you whole, he has a poet's soul, and the heart of a man's man
I know he'll say that he's in love
But between you and me, he won't be good enough!

[Chorus]
You're beautiful baby from the outside in
Chase your dreams but always know the road that'll lead you home again
Go on, take on this whole world
But to me you know you'll always be, my little girl",Tim McGraw,2007,"[85, 78, 62, 52, 49, 47]",6
411,Phantom Limb,"[Verse 1]
Foals in winter coats
White girls of the north
File past; one, five, and one
They are the fabled lambs
Of Sunday ham
The EHS norm

[Verse 2]
And they could float above the grass
In circles if they tried
A latent power I know they hide
To keep some hope alive
That a girl like I
Could ever try
Could ever try

[Chorus 1]
So we just skirt the hallway sides
A phantom and a fly
Follow the lines
And wonder why
There's no connection

[Verse 3]
A week of rolling eyes
And cheap shots from the tribe
And we're off to Nemarca's porch again
Another afternoon
Of the goat-head tunes
And pilfered booze

[Verse 4]
We wander through her Momma's house
The milk from the window lights
Family portrait, circa '95
This is that foreign land
With the sprayed-on tans
And it all feels fine
Be it silk or slime

[Chorus 2]
So, when they tap our Monday heads
To zombie-walk in our stead
This town seems hardly worth the time
And we'll no longer memorize or rhyme
Too far along in our crime
Stepping over what now towers to the sky
With no connection

Oh, oh-oh, oh-ohh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-ohh

진지 빨지마 인마 어차피 예능 아니냐
빡세게 설탕 모아서 비싼 밥이나 한 턱 쏴
동네 친구 얘기에 다시 보기를 결제
친구 친구였던 놈들이 거기서 경쟁해
난 심취했고 맘 비우고 봤어 대박 친 drama
이번 시즌에는 나는 어떤 역이 될까
검색 검색해 Naver, Facebook, Instagram
그 많은 랩퍼 뭐 해 먹고사나 궁금해
누군 강남 홍대 클럽 죽돌이가 됐대
누군 음원 갱스터 혹은 예술가가 됐네
행사 좀 뛰었대 근데 길어봐야 삼 개월
무료 공개 벌스 몇 개 내고 허송세월 야

Made Hov say, ""Okay, so, make another Hov!""
Niggas wasn't playin' they day role
So we parted ways like Ben and J-Lo
I shoulda been did it but I been in a daze though
I put friends over business end of the day though
But when friends' business interests is Day Glow
Ain't nothin' left to say though
I guess we forgot what we came fo'
Shoulda stayed in food and beverage
Too much flossin', too much Sam Rothstein
I ain't a bitch but I gotta divorce them
Hov had to get the shallow shit up off him
And I ain't even want to be famous
Niggas is brainless to unnecessarily go through these changes
And I ain't even know how it came to this
Except that fame is the worst drug known to man
It's stronger than, heroin
When you could look in the mirror like, ""There I am""
And still not see what you've become
I know I'm guilty of it too, but not like them; you lost one

'Cause what she prefers over me is work
And that's where we differ
So I have to give her free time, even if it hurts
So, breathe, mami, it's deserved
You've been put on this Earth
To be all you can be like the Reserves
And me? My time in the army, it's served
So I have to allow she her time to serve
The time's now for her, in time she'll mature
And maybe we can be we again like we were
Finally, my time's too short to share
And to ask her now it ain't fair, so yeah, she lost one

On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

I hope you think my favorite song

I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake

And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep

""When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place""

When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

419,What Hurts The Most,"[Verse 1]
I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That don’t bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
I’m not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though goin' on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I’m okay
But that’s not what gets me

[Chorus]
What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin' so much to say
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowing
What could've been
And not seein' that love in you
Is what I was tryin’ to do

[Verse 2]
It’s hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I’m doin’ It
It’s hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I’m alone
Still harder
Gettin' up, gettin' dressed, livin’ with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken

[Chorus]
What hurts the most
Is being so close
And havin' so much to say much to say
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowing
What could've been
And not seeing that love in you
Is what I was trying to do, oh

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin' so much to say (much to say)
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
And not seeing that love in you
Is what I was trying to do, oh

I can take from you

Feeling unappreciated

Woke up this morning and saw your face
And you didn't look the same as yesterday
I got the feeling that you can't seem to see

You come in, take a shower and then say I'm gone
What am I to do
With my heart just leave

I'm trying hard to give you another chance

I thought you was the most perfect man
That I ever seen
I still don't understand why
You treat me like you do
I use to give into your lust
Now I see the truth
Oh no I don't want to hear it all through
Yea I know I'll still be missing you
But it's not worth the pain
That came from you
You made me feel
Unappreciated

Nigga, you might want to fall back from recordin'
What you write is not important
So it forced him to go for the hype

I'll make you tell these other dudes gimme got you here

I'll take you there, take my time
Take your clothes off, you take off mine
Ma, show me what you got

Label being shady with you, who do you talk to?
Nigga your career is done as soon as they drop you
And all those little groupies you was cool with forgot you

How the fuck is my fanbase s'posed to grow, alright?""

Up on a high wire that's ready to break
When I've had just about all I can take
Baby you, baby you save me

Revenge in their eyes, Hennessy and the ganja

Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind
Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind
(Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind)
Whenever, if ever, I roll up, it's sown up
Any ghetto will tell ya, ""Nas helped grow us up""
My face once graced promotional Sony trucks
Hundred million and billin', I helped blow 'em up
Gave my man my right, I could have went left
So like my girl Foxy, the kid went deaf
So people, who's your top 10? Is it MC Shan? Is it MC Ren?

The bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin'
Come through, something ill, missing the ceilin'
What influenced my raps? Stick-ups and killings
Kidnappings, project buildings, drug dealings
Criticize that, why's that?
‘Cause Nas rap is compared to legitimized crap
‘Cause we love to talk on nasty chickens
Most intellectuals will only half listen
So you can't blame jazz musicians
Or David Stern with his NBA fashion issues
Oh, I think they like me, in my white tee
You can't ice me, we here for life, B
On my second marriage, hip hop's my first wifey
And for that, we not taking it lightly
If hip hop should die, we die together
Bodies in the morgue lie together, all together now

Everybody sound the same, commercialize the game
Reminiscing when it wasn't all business
It forgot where it started
So we all gather here for the dearly departed

One homeboy became a man, then a mobster
If it dies, let me get my last swig of vodka
RIP, we'll donate your lungs to a rasta
Went from turntables to MP3's
From ""Beat Street""to commercials on Mickey D's
From gold cables to Jacobs
From plain facials to Botox and face lifts

And they came to show love

Love me or hate me, that is the question
If you love me then Thank you!
If you hate me then F*** you!

441,Tell Me Baby,"[Verse 1]
They come from every state to find
Some dreams were meant to be declined
Tell the man what did you have in mind
What have you come to do?
No turning water into wine
No learning while you're in the line
I'll take you to the broken sign
You see these lights are blue
Come and get it
Lost it at the city limit
Say goodbye, cause they
Will find a way to trip it
Everybody's looking for a silly gimmick
Got to get away
Can't take it for another minute
This town is made of many things
Just look at what the current brings
So high it's almost promising
This place was made on you

[Chorus]
Tell me baby
What's your story?
Where you come from
And where you want to go this time, oh
Tell me lover
Are you lonely?
The thing we need is never all that hard to find, oh
Tell me baby
What's your story
Where you come from
And where you want to go this time, oh
You're so lovely
Are you lonely?
Giving up on the innocence you left behind

[Verse 2]
Some claim to have the fortitude
Too shrewd to blow the interlude
Sustaining pain to set the mood
Step out to be renewed
I'll move you like a baritone
Jungle brother's on the microphone
Getting over with the undertone
It's time to turn to stone
Chitty chitty baby
When your nose is in the nitty gritty
Life can be a little sweet
But life can be a little shitty
What a pity
Boston and a Kansas City
Looking for a hundred
But you only ever found a fifty
Three fingers in the honeycomb
You ring just like a xylophone
Devoted to the chromosome
The day that you left home

[Chorus]
Tell me baby
What's your story?
Where you come from
And where you want to go this time, oh
Tell me lover
Are you lonely?
The thing we need is never all that hard to find, oh
Tell me baby
What's your story
Where you come from
And where you want to go this time, oh
You're so lovely
Are you lonely?
Giving up on the innocence you left behind
Tell me baby
What's your story?
Where you come from
And where you want to go this time, oh
Tell me lover
Are you lonely?
The thing we need is never all that hard to find, oh
Tell me baby
What's your story
Where you come from
And where you want to go this time, oh
You're so lovely
Are you lonely?

Higher now than ever before

And see the place where you used to live

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat

Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said ""Bye Suzanne""
After the first night, but tonight I am

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat

The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was ""come sunlight, scram,"" now we hug tight, and...
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me

River (ooh), river run
Call me (ooh), call me (ooh)
River (ooh), we'll let the river run

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Always the bridesmaid, never ""The bride, hey!""
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one (I'm sorry)
I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)
If all it's gonna cause is pain

451,A Great Big Sled,"[Verse 1]
This snowman is shaping up to be an 8
But not out of 10
The robots awake to find that they've been taped down
Wondering when they'll break through these chains
But little boys have action toys for brains
I'm living proof it can last a long time
Now the girls off the street are innocent and sweet
When they're all in bed
They got their make-up and dreams of wonderland
Sprinkled inside their heads
And soon they will change
But tonight Hollywood has never seemed so strange
Now mother's pray it'll last a long time

[Chorus]
I want to roll around like a kid in the snow
I want to re-learn what I already know
Just let me take flight
Dressed in red, through the night
On a great big sled

I want to wish you merry Christmas
Ho Ho Ho

[Verse 2]
Now they boys are all grown up
And their working their fingers to the bone
They go around chasing them girls on the weekend
You know they still can't be alone
I've been racking my brain
With thoughts of peace and love
How on earth did we get so mixed up?
I pray to god it don't last a long time

[Chorus]
I want to roll around like a kid in the snow
I want to re-learn what I already know
Just let me take flight
Dressed in red, through the night
On a great big sled

I hear the sound of bells
There's something on the roof
I wonder what this night will bring

[Chorus]
I want to roll around like a kid in the snow
I want to re-learn what I already know
Just let me take flight
Dressed in red, through the night
On a great big sled

[Outro]
I want to wish you merry Christmas
(Can't do that)
I want to wish you merry Christmas
(Can't do that)",The Killers,2007,[88],1

453,I Loved Her First,"Look at the two of you dancing that way
Lost in the moment and each other's face
So much in love your alone in this place
Like there's nobody else in the world
I was enough for her not long ago
I was her number one, she told me so
And she still means the world to me
Just so you know
So be careful when you hold my girl
Time changes everything
Life must go on
And I'm not going to stand in your way

But I loved her first, I held her first
And a place in my heart will always be hers
From the first breath she breathed
When she first smiled at me
I knew the love of a father runs deep
And I prayed that she'd find you someday
But it still hard to give her away
I loved her first

How could that beautiful woman with you
Be the same freckle face kid that I knew
The one that I read all those fairy tales to
And tucked into bed all those nights
And I knew the first time I saw you with her
It was only a matter of time

But I loved her first and I held her first
And a place in my heart will always be hers
From the first breath she breathed
When she first smiled at me
I knew the love of a father runs deep
And I prayed that she'd find you someday
But its still hard to give her away
I loved her first

From the first breath she breathed
When she first smiled at me
I knew the love of a father runs deep
Someday you might know what I'm going through
When a miracle smiles up at you
I loved her first",Heartland,2007,[90],1
454,Tu Amor,"Letra de ""En Donde Está Tu Amor""

El tiempo que pasó
Se lo llevó la vida
Solo queda tu aroma
Con la cama destendida

Recuerdos se apoderan de mi mente
Un vaso con un tequila caliente
El dolor haciéndonos compañía
Y yo que pensaba que no dolía

¿En Dónde Está Tú Amor?
¿A dónde se marchó?
A dónde se esfumó aquella esperanza de que vuelvas
Y es que solo el sabor de tus besos me llega

Y lo que sucedió
Que a la gente le asombre
Y es que lo que me hiciste en verdad que no tiene nombre
De que sirve tu adiós si ya no volverás

Aquí te esperaré
Si piensas regresar

¿En Dónde Está Tú Amor?
¿A dónde se marchó?
A dónde se esfumó aquella esperanza de que vuelvas
Y es que solo el sabor de tus besos me llega

Y lo que sucedió
Que a la gente le asombre
Y es que lo que me hiciste en verdad que no tiene nombre
De que sirve tu adiós si ya no volverás

Aquí te esperaré
Si piensas regresar...",Virlán García,2007,[100],1
