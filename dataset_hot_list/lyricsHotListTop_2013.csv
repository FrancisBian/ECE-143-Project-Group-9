0,The Monster,"[Intro: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon ‘cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
‘Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic ‘cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, ‘cause I'm—

[Chorus: Rihanna & (Bebe Rexha)]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it ‘cause you never know when it all
Could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo! I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
‘Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
‘Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—

[Chorus: Rihanna & (Bebe Rexha)]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that
I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
I'll take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great!
It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back
In the draft, turn nothin' into somethin', still can make that
Straw into gold, chump, I will spin—Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket
Face facts: I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that!
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the—

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

[Bridge: Rihanna & (Eminem)]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
(Get along with) Get along with the voices inside of my head

1,Timber,"[Verse 1]
Aren't you somethin' to admire?
'Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
And I can't help but notice
You reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and
The glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always
Parallel on the other side

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the past
I'm here tryna pull you through
You just gotta be strong

[Chorus]
I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror staring back at me  (Oh)
I couldn't get any bigger (Oh)
With anyone else beside me (Oh)
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

[Verse 2]
Aren't you somethin', an original?
'Cause it doesn't seem merely assembled
And I can't help but stare, 'cause
I see truth somewhere in your eyes
I can't ever change without you
You reflect me, I love that about you
And if I could, I
Would look at us all the time

I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go

Tomorrow's a mystery, oh
I can see you lookin' back at me
Keep your eyes on me
Baby, keep your eyes on me

2,Counting Stars,"[Chorus]
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Yeah, we'll be counting stars

[Verse 1]
I see this life, like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
And in my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye' shall find
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told

[Pre-Chorus]
I-I-I-I feel something so right
Doing the wrong thing
I-I-I-I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing

I feel the love and I feel it burn
Down this river, every turn
Hope is our four-letter word
Make that money, watch it burn

Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told

Doing the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars

Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'll be the one, if you want me to
Anywhere, I would've followed you

And I... am feeling so small
It was over my head

And I will stumble and fall

Just starting to crawl

You're the one that I love
And I'm saying goodbye

[Verse 1]
I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In a torn up town, no postcode envy

[Pre-Chorus]
But every song's like
Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care; we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like
Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care; we aren't caught up in your love affair

[Chorus]
And we'll never be royals (Royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us

Let me be your ruler (Ruler)
You can call me queen bee
And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)

My friends and I, we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows
That we're fine with this

When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth

[Hook]
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...

[Verse 1]
Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

[Verse 2]
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...

Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain

She don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone

And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I've been holding on too tight
With nothing in between

I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm
And time is frozen
The story of my life
I give her hope
I spend her love
Until she's broke inside
The story of my life

[Verse 2: Niall Horan &  Liam Payne]
Written on these walls are the colours that I can't change
Leave my heart open
But it stays right here in its cage

I'll see us in the light up on the hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still

To keep her warm
And time is frozen
The story of my life
I give her hope
I spend her love
Until she's broke inside

And I been waiting for this time to come around

I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath

12,Burn,"[ELIZA]
I saved every letter you wrote me
From the moment I read them
I knew you were mine
You said you were mine
I thought you were mine

Do you know what Angelica said
When we saw your first letter arrive?
She said

“Be careful with that one, love
He will do what it takes to survive.”

You and your words flooded my senses
Your sentences left me defenseless
You built me palaces out of paragraphs
You built cathedrals
I’m re-reading the letters you wrote me
I’m searching and scanning for answers
In every line
For some kind of sign
And when you were mine
The world seemed to

Burn
Burn

You published the letters she wrote you
You told the whole world how you brought
This girl into our bed
In clearing your name, you have ruined our lives
Do you know what Angelica said
When she read what you’d done?
She said
“You have married an Icarus
He has flown too close to the sun.”

You and your words, obsessed with your legacy...
Your sentences border on senseless
And you are paranoid in every paragraph
How they perceive you

You, you, you…

I’m erasing myself from the narrative
Let future historians wonder how Eliza
Reacted when you broke her heart
You have torn it all apart
I am watching it
Burn
Watching it burn
The world has no right to my heart
The world has no place in our bed
They don’t get to know what I said
I’m burning the memories
Burning the letters that might have redeemed you
You forfeit all rights to my heart
You forfeit the place in our bed
You sleep in your office instead
With only the memories
Of when you were mine
I hope that you burn",Original Broadway Cast of Hamilton,2013,"[13, 16, 21, 36, 48, 57, 57, 63, 68, 72, 81, 94, 99, 100, 53]",15
13,Sweater Weather,"[Verse 1]
And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn’t wanna tell you about, no

[Chorus]
'Cause it's too cold for you here
And now, so let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

[Verse 2]
And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour

[Pre-Chorus]
Comin' down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about

I wanna just live
Inside my Cadillac

Now throw it up (I throw that up)
That’s what it is (that’s what it is)
In my C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C, bitch (biatch)

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Can’t see me through my tints (nah ah)
I’m riding real slow (slow motion)
In my paint, wet, dripping, shining like my 24s (umbrella)
I ain’t got 24s (nuh-uh)
But I’m on those Vogues
That’s those big white walls, round them hundred spokes
Old school like Olde English in that brown paper bag
I’m rolling in that same whip that my granddad had
Hello haters, damn y’all mad
30K on the Caddy, now how backpack rap is that?

[Chorus: Hollis]
I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Man, I’m lounging
In some shit Bernie Mac would’ve been proud of
Looking down from heaven like damn that’s stylish
Smilin’, don’t pay attention to the mileage
Can I hit the freeway? Illegally going 120
Easy weaving in and out of the traffic
They cannot catch me, I’m smashing
I’m ducking, bucking them out here
I’m looking fucking fantastic, I am up in a classic
Now I know what it’s like under the city lights
Riding into the night, driving over the bridge
The same one we walked across as kids
Knew I’d have a whip but never one like this
Old school, old school, candy paint, two seater
Yea, I’m from Seattle, there’s hella Honda Civics
I couldn’t tell you about paint either
But I really wanted a Caddy so I put in the hours
And roll on over to the dealer
And I found the car I dreamed of, placed a bargain with this geezer
Got the keys in as I was leaving I started screaming

[Chorus: Hollis]
I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Backwoods and dope
White hoes in the backseat snortin' coke
She doing line after line like she's writing rhymes
I had her inhalin' my love, tryna blow her mind
Cadillac pimpin', my uncle was on
14, I stole his keys, me and my niggas was gone
Stealing portions of his liquor, water in his Patron
Driving smiling like I won the fucking lottery homes
(Fuckin' lottery homes)
Tires with the spokes on it, and the Vogues too
Mustard and mayonnaise, keepin' the buns all on
My dogs hanging out the window
Young as whoosh, fucking like we ball
Tryna fuck 'em all
Never park the whip, see what's poppin' at the mall
Meet a bad bitch, slap her booty with my paw
You can smoke the pussy, I was tearing down the walls
I'm motherfuckin' awe-
-some, swear these sights tryna hypnotize
Grip the leather steering wheel while I grip the thighs
See the lust stuck up in her eyes
Maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?
Or does she want it low?
'Cause this shit a Coupe de Ville so you’ll never know
So we cruise for minutes, my nigga fuck the limit
Got a window tinted, for sure a gangsta in it
Slide 'til the gas is finished

I would fall apart if you break my heart

I knew you were, you were gonna come to me

Your enemy (Your enemy), your enemy

So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?

Mark my words, this love will make you levitate

Shawty's heart is on steroids, 'cause her love is so strong
You may fall in love when you meet her (Meet her)
If you get the chance, you better keep her (Keep her)
She's sweet as pie, but if you break her heart
She turn cold as a freezer (Freezer)
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my sleeping beauty, I'm gon' put her in a coma (Woo!)
Damn, I think I love her, shawty's so bad, I'm sprung and I don't care
She ride me like a roller coaster, turn the bedroom into a fair (A fair)
Her love is like a drug, I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil mama so dope, I messed around and got addicted

And everyone's competing for a love they won't receive
'Cause what this palace wants is release

Nothin' like your last guy, he too square for you
He don't smack that ass and pull your hair like that

Io faccio lo scemo ma co' lei no, non attacca
Io tipo da Campari, lei da oliva nel Manhattan
La volante passa, stasera tira un'ariaccia
Non ho mai imparato a fare il nodo alla cravatta
Ma tanto tutto passa, forse dovrei cambiare aria
Prendere il primo volo Alitalia
Ubriaco in strada con i miei canto Albachiara
Al distributore senza scheda sanitaria
Io che c’ho solo guai dentro le tasche dei miei Levi's
Vorrei rubare i desideri a Fontana di Trevi
Abbiamo stesso sangue, no, non serve che mi spieghi
Te dimmi dove sei mi faccio tutta Roma a piedi
Il tuo ricordo sfuma, una notte senza luna
Lei si morde un'unghia e fuma
E questa birra è tutta schiuma
Sorrido a mio fratello, siamo su di giri
Fiori cresciuti in mezzo ai sampietrini

E c’avrei scommesso su noi due
Una vita intera sempre in due

E invece ognuno per le sue

Sveglia all'alba pe' 'l mercato delle sette
Ho tamponato una mini ferma al verde
Il ragazzino in auto mi fa ""Gne gne gne gne""
Il nasone scorre sempre non la smette
Ho perso il treno poi l'aereo pe' Berlino
Vorrei trasformare questa pioggia in vino
A Nettuno i miei ricordi Polaroid
Ciocco le foto porno di Leotta su un tabloid
Scotch sulla fotocamera del Mac
Non ce la faccio più-uh va bene coffee break
Ho passato mesi a balla’ la techno
Il mio amico veneto mi chiama vecchio
La mia amica che nasconde il sushi nella borsa Gucci
A terra panni sporchi che non stendo (no no no no no)
Un’altra multa di sale che prendo (oh oh oh)

""Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings.""
""But I'm only going to get this one chance."" (Six minutes— Six minutes—)
""Something's wrong, I can feel it."" (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
""Just a feeling I've got. Like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. 
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; 
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances.""
""You are just what the doc ordered.""

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot

[Verse 1]
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody wants the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got

[Verse 2]
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!""—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—

[Verse 3]
So you'll be Thor, I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?!
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?",Eminem,2013,"[34, 39, 48, 59, 32, 13, 17, 21, 7]",9

Too soon, but the good Lord knows
The reasons why, I guess

I don't do two things: that's love and that's trust
And I don't hate y'all, I'm just fuckin' with us
And that's word to Nipsey
My hustle's mean, I can sell bats to Ken Griffey
I'm like Lionel Richie, my fans have me touring till 2050
This cycle is evil
This verse is for Tino
One time for my people
And fuck all these fakers
Can't wait till you back on your feet, the streets need you

I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free, Randy

[Chorus: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me (yeah)
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me (2 Chainz)
No help, that's all me, all me for real

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ring, dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
(Ah) She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me, I said, ""Baby girl, fall in line""
Okay, made a million off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, ""Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!""
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga, God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested(Tru)

[Chorus: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me

Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me

[Verse 2: Drake]
I touched down in '86, knew I was the man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
'Cause myself just told myself:
""You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help""
Cashing checks and I’m bigging up my chest
Y'all keep talking ‘bout who next, but I’m about as big as it gets
I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I’m the light skinned Keith Sweat, I'ma make it last forever
It’s not your turn 'cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I’m on the road box office sales
I’m getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
'Cause if we judging off your advances
Then I just got paid like eight advances, God damn!

[Chorus: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Ho, shut the fuck up!
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rent's due
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everything—everything but gentle
But I still take my time, man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine
Leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me and I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't working
Lil' bitch...

[Verse 4: Drake]
Oh me, oh me, oh my
I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year
I'll do King of Diamonds 3 more times
Smoking on that kush all in our section
Like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way
Sometimes it be like that
They don't really fuck with you like that
They ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got the shine
I let you eat like that
I been taught to never loan somebody
What you need right back
And I need that shit right back
(No more free Randy) I’m blessed than a muhfucka
Niggas been stressed than a muhfucka
Niggas getting nervous
Clutching they chests like a muhfucka
Damn that’s a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don’t listen to you
'Cause I don’t like being lied to
And that ship won’t sail
And that wind won’t guide you

Like a motherfucking drive-thru

Now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do",Drake,2013,"[40, 37, 40, 46, 45, 52, 45, 44, 43, 41, 40, 20]",12

I got a little drunk last night
There's something 'bout a midnight rain
Staring at the ceiling fan
I couldn't get you off my brain
I guess I wasn't thinking straight
I couldn't tell wrong from right
I went ahead and called you up
I got a little drunk last night

[Pre-Chorus]
Brought it all up, got it all out
What is it worth to both of us now?
It's off my chest, but never off my mind
Two drinks in, hit that hurt
You feel bad, and I feel worse
I swear it's the last time every time
Don't know why

[Chorus]
Might've been a song on the radio
Might've been nothing, baby I don't know
Might've been a little too tired to fight
Might've been I got a little drunk last night

I got a little too far gone
Heart was talking way too loud
I don't remember what I said
I just remember breaking down

Brought it all up, got it all out

It's off my chest, but never off my mind
Two drinks in, hit that hurt
You feel bad, and I feel worse

Don't know why

Might've been a song on the radio
Might've been nothing, baby I don't know

And she'll do whatever she wants
And when she moves every jaw's gonna drop
And I do but I don't want her to stop
I want, I want I want whatever she's got
I want whatever she's got

Tell your mind before you thought it
What you thought your plan was park it
To figure out where your heart is so twisted up
Have you spendin' every weekend
And every penny you've been keepin'
Just to figure out what she's thinkin' when you're thinkin' it's love

Shes got the blue jeans painted on tight
That everybody wants on a Saturday night

And when she moves every jaw's gonna drop

On the edge of a kiss

That everybody wants on a Saturday night
She got the mood ring, she's never the same
I want, I want, I want, I want, I want

Shes got the blue jeans painted on tight

46,Sweet Annie,"[Verse 1]
I've been burning bright
For so long I can't remember
Pretty girls and late night bars seem to be my line of work
Believe me when I say, I can't stay this high forever
This man has had all he can stand, time to lay this body down

[Chorus]
Sweet Annie
Can I stay with you a while?
'Cause this road's been putting miles on my heart
Sweetheart I've been living in a fantasy
But one day, lightning will strike
And my bark will lose its bite
But don't give up on me
Sweet Annie

[Verse 2]
Sweet Annie
I know I promised you a life
But with an empty bed and the words I said don't carry any weight
If I could take back yesterday, find a way to start it over
Turn around, put that bottle down and I'd pray it's not too late

[Chorus]
Sweet Annie
Can I stay with you a while?
'Cause this road's been putting miles on my heart
Sweetheart I've been living in a fantasy
But one day, lightning will strike
And my bark will lose its bite
But don't give up on me
What will be will be
Sweet Annie

[Verse 3]
Turn out the light
These hands they long to hold you
Fall all over you
All over again
Come a little closer so I can show you
My heart still beats fast for you
All over, and over again

Sweet Annie
Can I stay with you a while?
'Cause this road's been putting miles on my heart

We got a whole lotta new money though
Don't judge, fuck it

Ayy, uh

[Verse]
Raindrop, drop top
I got Migos to pass the weed
I'm not offset, but I set off with the takeoff
Probably why the hottie gotta body like Cardi B
Bob Marley, I pass the weed
Pass the tree, 'cause my lyrics are a masterpiece
You can find me in the house like I'm Ali G
And I got a motherfuckin' ounce like I'm Charlie Sheen (Perfect)
Fuck my ex, I can't stand her, argh
Fuck my friends, I ain't Chandler, argh
First names Blake, not Adam
See me travellin' the longest yards, I'm A. Sandler, argh
I was in a hotel loungin'
Me and Baggsy were smokin' cones
And now I'm tryna get a bag on my broken phone
I'm livin' like a rockstar like I'm Post Malone
Slow down one time, baby, let's go
Heck no, I'm tryna put a house up in escrow
I just wanna get a Ying Yang Twin
Then show 'em my Lil Jon till the girls wanna get low (Yeah!)
I'm the one to put a bar in the underground
You motherfuckers better make your thanks
When it comes to the dollar, dollar bills
Yeah, Chillin' get all the money, I'm a Saint George bank
(Perfect) Woo, woo, find me at a rave
Gettin' blazed with the kush and I'm lookin' for a pill hit
Got the gloves at the back
With the ball, my brother, I ain't never Adam Gilchrist
Only my Don Bradman would get that
The bender it goes five days: test match
This ain't the Basement Jaxx
But ""Where's your head at?""
Ha, stay in the cut with the sesh lad
Call up my crew, ""Where the sesh at?""
If it's your wife we don't text back
Arnie Schwarzenegger, I flex rap
Hit the forty, Rick and Morty
Fly through space, stay high with a jetpack
Swear that your bitch is boring, switch the story
You might end in the place where my ex at (Perfect)
I'm a man, bruv, I do what a man does
So I do it for my man then my man up
I grew up not fuckin' with the mainstream
'Cause I had Big L rockin' on my Samsung
You can't be damn stupid
Brother, I'm Chill, don't ask your man, ""Who's this?""
I jump on the Gram, I pass the damn doobie
I smoke me a spliff like Armin Van Buren
No money, so I skip my rent
See Jackson high all the time like 50 Cent
I ain't ever done Muay Thai
But I still get high with my homies that hit the legs
All of you faggots are soundin' American
Bruv, I'm the pimp at your party
Check out this Aussie that's swaggin'
With Nautica jackets and shrimps on the barbie (Perfect)
These days I'm sippin' the cheap whiskey
Till the day that I die I'll be high
No surprise, I ain't givin' a fuck, it seems risky
I'll overdose on Nurofen Plus like 360
I was under satan's spell
But Blake rebelled, the drugs I would take as well
I blazed the L, then stare up at the face of hell
That make a motherfucker laugh like I'm Dave Schapelle
Look back at it, oh my God
Wu-Tang Clan's playin' on my iPod
Got a white girl in some lingerie
She pass J’s with her arse in my face and the lights on

And I promise you all that I know, every way that my mind goes

When my intuition got me in a mission, we see eye to eye but you ain't in my vision
Oh no, I said oh no
Back in the day I used to say a girl like you
I used to pray for days for
Now I'm out here like way more, what the fuck would I stay for?
Why the fuck would I pay for somethin' that’s just gonna kill me? Nikki I'm still me

69,Up All Night,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Kush rolled, glass full: I prefer the better things
Niggas with no money act like money isn't everything
I'm havin' a good time, they just trying to ruin it
Shout out to the fact that I'm the youngest nigga doing it
Cap on, brim bent, Denzel, every time
She ain't tryna pop that shit for pimp; okay, well nevermind
I-I-I tried to told you, Drizzy still ain't nothin' nice
Bracelet saying ""you should quit"", cars saying ""fuck your life""
Okay now we outta here, toodles to you bitches
And if you dolled up, I got the voodoo for you bitches
I'm busy gettin' rich, I don't want trouble
I made enough for two niggas, boy: stunt double
Fame is like a drug that I've taken too much of
But I never ever trip, just peace, happiness and love
I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug
Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talkin' about
They opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Aww, so we do it how we do it
All up in your face man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night, whole crew's in here
Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Aww, man I love my team
Man I love my team, I would die for them niggas, aww

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Drizzy say get her, I'ma get her
I got the kind of money, that make a broke bitch bitter
I got that kinda—wait, wait—fixate
Which bitch, you know made a million off a mixtape?
That was just a keepsake, bought the president
The Louis presidential briefcase, never been a cheapskate
We got the Hawks, I ain't talkin' about the Peach State
Man, for Pete's sake, scratch that—sweepstakes
(Ha ha ha ha ha) Fuck I look like, ho?
I look like ""yes"" and you like ""no""
I'm a bad bitch, I ain't never been a mixed breed
On a diet, but I'm doin' donuts in a 6-speed
M6 in front of M2
I see a lot of rap bitches on the menu
But I collect 100 thou' at the venue
And pop bottles with my team, Young Money 'til the death of me

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talkin' about
They opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Aww, so we do it how we do it

Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Aww, man I love my team
Man I love my team, I would die for them niggas, aww

[Interlude: Nicki Minaj & Drake]
I mean, we can't even rock them shoes
If it don't got a comma on the price tag, you know?
I mean, I mean but then again
Who, who looks at the price tag, you know?
Aww yeah we in this bitch (uhh)

Is that what devils do?
Took you so low
Where only fools go
I shook the angel in you

Rising up to you
Filled with all the strength I found
There's nothing I can’t do

Destroy everything
They bring down angels like you

Filled with all the strength I found
There's nothing I can’t do

If I don't have you with me, I'm alone
You know I never know which way to go
I think I need you with me for all-time
When I need new direction for my mind
You listen to my lectures on the phone
You help me find the treasure in the hole
You'll tell me if I'm acting like a fool
I know that you're not something to lose, now

[Chorus]
I've got something to confess
I keep you in my pocket to use
You're my only compass
I might get lost without you

[Verse 2]
Could you tell me where to go?
You're always there to help me when I'm down
I'm lucky you've been keeping me around
You're the star I look for every night
When it's dark, you'll stick right by my side

[Chorus]
I've got something to confess
I keep you in my pocket to use (I keep you in my pocket)
You're my only compass (Yeah)
I might get lost without you

Like a magnet
Hard to imagine ever changing
Anything changing my way
Baby, like a magnet
Can't help that I'm attracted to you, I am
Could you keep on guiding me?
Please

I've got something to confess
I keep you in my pocket to use

[Verse 1]
What's your all-time high, your good as it gets?
Your hands down best ever make-up sex?
What's your guilty pleasure, your old go to?
Well if you asked me, mine would be you

[Verse 2]
What's your worst hangover, your best night yet?
Your 90 proof, your Marlboro Red?
The best damn thing you lucked into
That's easy girl, mine would be you

[Chorus]
Mine would be you
Sun keeps shinin', back road flyin'
Singin' like crazy fools
Makin' up our own words, laughin' 'til it hurts
Baby, if I had to choose
My best day ever, my finest hour
My wildest dream come true
Mine would be you

[Verse 3]
What's your double dare, your go all in?
The craziest thing you ever did?
Plain as your name in this tattoo
Look on my arm, mine would be you

[Chorus]
Mine would be you
Sun keeps shinin', back road flyin'
Singin' like crazy fools
Makin' up our own words, laughin' 'til it hurts
Baby, if I had to choose
My best day ever, my finest hour
My wildest dream come true
Mine would be you

[Bridge]
What's the greatest chapter in your book?
Are there pages where it hurts to look?
What's the one regret you can't work through?
You got it baby, mine would be you
Yeah, you got it baby, mine would be you

[Chorus]
Mine would be you
Taillights fadin', daylight breakin'
Standing there like a fool
When I should've been runnin', yellin' out somethin'
To make you want to hold on to
The best love ever, girl, can you tell me
The one thing you'd rather die than lose?
'Cause mine would be you

73,Cannonball,"[Chorus]
I don’t know what was wrong
But I wasn’t as strong
I’ve seen daisies hold cannonballs above them
But if this was a dream
I still know that I’ve seen
Fields of daisies hold cannonballs above them

[Poetry Section]
I’m so far from perfect
You still loved me when I so far from deserved it
If I’m so brave why does looking you in the eye take every ounce of my courage?
I hang my face to the linoleum and count the freckles on the floor
All of us, all of us are a galaxy of tiny little storms
The good and evil in me wage a bloody civil war
The missiles whistle through me then the rebel pistols roar
I shiver and the final slivers of my chivalry retreat my shriveled core
I can’t imagine that I’ll ever be happy like before
Before, before
We’re sitting in a field in Golden Gate Park off Fulton and 4th
And I’ve never felt less alone
Just a block from the home I’ve outgrown
Five feet and forty years to the right from where dad proposed
An inch above this casserole of stones, grass and mud, rusty needles, lost guitar picks, Indian tombs, and dinosaur bones
Everything happened all at once
And the world is spinning like a hubcap, and not just because of the drugs
We hugged and laid there in each others’ arms all night
Even when the sprinklers cried on us we didn’t mind
We had the rest of our lives to be dry
So we stayed until the edges of the sky turned light
I would have stayed until our hair turned white
The mosquitoes arrived to feast on time
Got drunk at our expense, we didn’t mind
We let them bite, we kept on kissing and obliged
Say “bottoms up, you’ve only got til Tuesday so enjoy the ride!”
And I couldn’t imagine that I would ever be unhappy again
And I whispered in your ear that this moment is already a poem
That I just figured out my first tattoo was going to be of bug bites
Decided I’d commemorate their bloody drink by printing three circles on my ankle, perfect and pink in permanent ink
The beautiful wounds that will keep me, you and this moment forever linked
To remind me when I fail myself, when I fail everyone around me
When I misfire and come tearing through your walls
When the cocktail of humiliation and pain poisons my veins
And this carnival of carnage, this mansion of garbage, this parking lot of carcasses, this heartbreak party drains the spirit that remains
That I have been a part of something worthwhile
To remind me of the pleasure of your pulse
The measure of your breath
The rise and fall of our fortunes and our chests
These spectacular triumphs and flops
That even if that moment meant nothing to the universe, it’s the closest thing to God I’ve got
I’m so far from perfect
So far it’s been worth it

[Bridge]
But if this was a dream
I still know that I've seen
Fields of daisies hold cannonballs above them

[Chorus]
I don’t know what was wrong
But I wasn’t as strong
I’ve seen daisies hold cannonballs above them
But if this was a dream
I still know that I’ve seen
Fields of daisies hold cannonballs above them

[Bridge]
But if this was a dream
I still know that I've seen
Fields of daisies hold cannonballs above them",Watsky,2013,[75],1

They ordered champagne but still look thirsty

Leave-a-pretty-girl-sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation

But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, ayo, we made it: Thanksgivin'
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on my wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to forget

Am I just insecure?

It's just you and me
Sometimes it feels like there's three

And while I wait, I put on my perfume

Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad, 'cause my rhymes on the rag
Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em, ""Stick it!""
So sick, I'm looking pale—wait, that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick

The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't that aftershave
Or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl, your body's bangin', jump me in, dang, bang-bang
Yes siree 'Bob', I was thinking the same thang
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang-dang
Pow-p-p-p-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow
Got your gal blowin' up a valve, valve-valve
Ain't slowin' down, throw in the towel, towel-towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is, are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid?
Hope so, now ho…

Far as hard drugs are though, that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow

And you know it, look at how she throw it
If it get any bigger baby girl gon' have to tow it
Sitting on them M's like Floyd
But she lied to you if she said I paid for it
Nigga 99 broads, 99 broads
Panoramic view from the 99th floor
I'm like 'my Lord' when she down on all fours
Got a hood bitch with me, she ain't scared of taking charge
Flying by in a car, you ain't know what you saw
She adjusting her bra as I’m lighting up a cigar
They was writing me off, now I arrive like a star
I just sit back and laugh the irony of it all
Let them bands go, let them bands go
Watch a nigga throw a grand or so on that camel toe
And be like 'Damn boy, why you cuffing that whore?'
The whole team smashed her and you ain't even know

[Chorus (Extended): T-Pain]
I ain't even know it, even know it

Give in to that easy living
Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
Start flipping for my enemies

Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you

[Verse 2]
So have you got the guts?
Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

Big blue eyes, pointy nose
Chasing mice and digging holes
Tiny paws up the hill
Suddenly you're standing still

Your fur is red, so beautiful

91,What Now,"[Verse 1]
I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat
I shouldn't be crying
Tears were for the weaker days
I'm stronger now, or so I say
But something's missing

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (Wait it out)
What now? Oh-oh-oh-ohh
What now?

I found the one
He changed my life
But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I'm supposed to be in love, but I'm numb again

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just sitting there laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

[Chorus]
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (Wait it out)
What now? (Please tell me)
What now?

[Bridge]
There's no one to call, 'cause I'm just playing games with them all
But the more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone
'Cause I spend every hour just going through the motions
I can't even get the emotions to come out
Dry as a bone, but I just wanna shout

Maybe it's the way she walked
Straight into my heart and stole it
Through the doors and past the guards
Just like she already owned it

She said, ""Never in your wildest dreams""

As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Give me that late 80s early 90s old school
Feeling like my second album, so cool
Chiraq summer looking so cruel
Look shorty in the eye, told me it was no rules
Went to speak but was like never mind
Let my mind just sneak back to a better time
When I was his age and if he's ever mine
Thinking he would only think back to this and never find
Better times to think back to when it comes
And he's older in the presence of somebody young
Telling him the same things that he told me
And he reacts the same way as that OG
But it's old school, it's like '03
And this old man is my old me
Takes a long time to happen so fast
To realize that your future is somebody else's past

Analog black vinyl spinning sounding so good
Top down, can't be a classic if it's no wood
If you don't know what, then you new school
Floor model is the foundation for your YouTubes
Model flows off of Fat Boys and Juice Crews
Melle Mel's, Ice-T's, and the 2 Cools
Add a Moe Dee and a Double L
Had to walk cause it's hard to run in those unbuckled shells
One microphone and a couple 12s
Six drum sounds and a couple bells
Is all you had to make a couple rails
And that's a track, and if you want a (eeeeeeeh)
You have to make it like that
Now what's one turtle to a couple snails?
Takes a long time to happen so fast
And realize your future is somebody else's past

Chiraq summer looking so cruel
How can I reel-to-reel when there's Pro Tool?
I can't dig it at all because there's no tube
Fire when you speak but ain't no warmth in your vocals
Might have been a better rhyme then just never mind
If it's better with time then think in line
That you're going to be your nicest 'round your midlife crisis
If you're life like Christ live your midlife like it's... Christ-like
Nigga I ain't psychic
I know it's all a cycle and everybody bike it
And France is enormous you're Lance with endorsements
But you might need a hand to enhance your performance
Consider this a kilogram of encouragement
Teach you how to sneak it past the enforcement
And when you get it through in a manner so cool
Remember to give a little nod to the old school
Wassup...

94,Survival,"[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
From the beginning it wasn't 'bout the ends, it was 'bout
Bustin' raps and standin' for somethin', fuck an acronym
Cut the fuckin' act like you're happy, I'm fuckin' back again
With another anthem – why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up, I'm afraid of What'll happen to them wolves when the thought of being thrown
Into an alligator pit, I salivate at it, wait is up
Hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homie, hold them bitches straighter up
Wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos, I ain't deflate enough
Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt, 'cause—

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals, I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man, will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed-up and got a bloodbath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter: I can adjust
Plus, I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So, floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this muh'fucka, and if I don't make the cut
What? Like I give a fuck! I'ma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
Through the side of a pump, 0 to 60, hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh, might've mistook
Me for bowin' out, I ain't takin' a bow, I'm stabbin' myself
With a fuckin' knife in the gut while I'm wipin' my butt
'Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like gettin' cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut
'Cause I'ma fight 'til I die or win, bitin' the dust
It'll just make me angrier; wait, let me remind you of what
Got me this far, picture me quittin'
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut!
It's survival of what?

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 3: Eminem]
(Yeah) So, get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle, now mount up, jump in the saddle
This is it—it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick
If I don't do this music shit, I'll lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth, it's all I know how to do
As soon as I get thrown in a booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue, I'm showin' you the flow no one do
'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit
So there's nothin' for me to fall back on, I know no other trade
So you better trade your fuckin' mics in for some tool-box-es
'Cause you'll never take my pride from me, it'll have to be pried from me
So, pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers!
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve
'Cause this is somethin' that I must use to succeed
And if you don't like me, then fuck you! Self-esteem
Must be fuckin' shootin' through the roof, 'cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bulletproof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you, I must be
Allergic to failure, 'cause everytime I come close to it
I just sneeze, but I just go achoo then a-chieve!

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die

95,The Heart Of Dixie,"(Verse 1)
She had a dead-end job at the National Bank
And a deadbeat husband who always drank
So when he didn't come home she had the gin to thank
For the tears in her eyes
So Dixie packed up and said her goodbyes and she went

(Chorus)
Driving so far away nobody's gonna find her
Flying just fast enough to leave it all behind her
But she didn't know till she hit the road deep in her soul
She's got the fire and the fight of a gypsy
Ain't nothing stronger than the heart of Dixie
The heart of Dixie

(Verse 2)
It's a funny thing when your world falls down
It's got a way of showing you what you're all about
Now Dixie's got her wheels pointed south
And she ain't never looking back
Nobody knew she was brave like that and she went

(Chorus)
Driving so far away nobody's gonna find her
Flying just fast enough to leave it all behind her
But she didn't know till she hit the road deep in her soul
She's got the fire and the fight of a gypsy
Ain't nothing stronger than the heart of Dixie
The heart of Dixie

(Bridge)
Yeah Dixie woke up to the truth one day
Grabbed her cheap sunglasses and her lipstick case and she went

(Chorus)
Driving so far away nobody's gonna find her
Flying just fast enough to leave it all behind her
But she didn't know till she hit the road deep in her soul
She's got the fire and the fight of a gypsy
Ain't nothing stronger than the heart of Dixie

[Intro: Jimmy Smith]
Good God Almighty—like back in the old days...
You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it. We had the champagne in the studio, of course—compliments of the company—and we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball. Only real music is gonna last—all the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow...

Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents
But thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn

And not say I'm the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here
So I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts
That I would share with myself
But I thought ""Fuck it"", it's worth it to share 'em
With someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think she's straight
'Cause she supported since Hot Beats
Right before Wayne came and got me
Out of the back room where I was rapping with Jas
Over beats that I shouldn't have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me always
Couldn't believe when he called me

Just hold my hand, even if you don't understand, hol' up

98,Right There,"[Intro]
If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party
Then put your hands up, put your hands up
If you, if you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party
Then put your hands up, put your hands up

[Refrain: Ariana Grande]
You got it, you got it, babe
You got it, you got it, babe
You got it, you got it, babe
You got it, you got it, babe

[Verse 1: Big Sean & Ariana Grande]
Okay, this, this, this for my number one girl who got the top spot title
Spent a hour in the bathroom, walked out looking like a model
God, doing what you do, got me right there with Apollo on the moon
Who needs genies in a bottle, girl, if they already got you?
Boy, you make me feel so lucky
Finally the stars align
Never has it been so easy to be in love
And to give you this heart of mine

[Pre-Chorus 1: Ariana Grande]
You know what I need
I know what you like
Put it all together, baby, we could be alright
How could this be wrong when it feels so right?
Yeah, I really love you
I really love you, oh
And I’ll never let you go

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
You should know I’m never gonna change
I’m always gonna stay
You call for me, I’m right there (right there)
Right there (right there)
'Cause you listen and you care
You’re so different
No one compares
And if you never change, I’m gonna stay right there
I’ll always be right there

[Refrain: Ariana Grande]
You got it, you got it, babe
You got it, you got it, baby

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
And I get butterflies, just thinking
About you boy, you’re on my mind
Sometimes I catch myself daydreaming
Lost in your eyes and I lose all track of time

[Pre-Chorus 2: Ariana Grande]
You know what I need
I know what you like
Put it all together, baby, we could be alright
How can this be wrong when it feels so right?
Yeah, I really need you
I really love you, oh
And I’ll never let you go

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
You should know I’m never gonna change
I’m always gonna stay
You call for me, I’m right there (right there)
Right there (right there)
'Cause you listen and you care
You’re so different
No one compares
And if you never change, I’m gonna stay right there
I’ll always be right there

[Refrain: Ariana Grande]
You got it, you got it, babe
You got it, you got it, baby

[Verse 3: Big Sean & Ariana Grande]
Now, if all fell through, would you catch me before the pavement?
If my Benz turned back to Public Transportation, would you still be at home for me with the candles waiting
And get my mind back adjacent to the place of a young visionary?
A player too, you know I have some girls missionary
My black book and numbers thicker than the dictionary and Bible
I got it recycled
I love and I like you
Five course meals, even though you don’t mind a drive-thru
That’s why I got you
And I’ll never let you go

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
You should know I’m never gonna change
I’m always gonna stay
You call for me, I’m right there (right there)
Right there (right there)
'Cause you listen and you care
You’re so different
No one compares
And if you never change, I’m gonna stay right there
I’ll always be right there

[Outro: Ariana Grande]
I’ll always be right there
I’ll always be right there
You got it, you got it baby
You got it, you got it baby
You got it, you got it baby
You got it, you got it baby, you got it babe",Ariana Grande,2013,"[100, 90, 86, 94, 90, 93, 100, 84]",8
99,Change Me,"[Verse 1]
Girl I'm ready if you're ready now
Oh, as I'm ever gonna be
If you're with it then I'm with it now
To accept all responsibility

[Pre-Chorus]
I go out of my way to live by the words that you say
I don't wanna be the same, oh

[Chorus]
Maybe you could change me
Maybe you could change me, woah
Maybe you could be the light that opens up my eyes
Make all my wrongs right, change me, change me

[Verse 2]
Don't fight fire with fire
If I'm screaming, talk quieter
Understanding and patience
Feel the pain that I'm facing

[Pre-Chorus]
Be like serenity, help reposition my mind
Take a chance make a difference, in my life

[Chorus]
Maybe you could change me
Maybe you could change me, woah
Maybe you could be the light that opens up my eyes
Make all my wrongs right, change me, change me

[Outro]
Girl I'm ready if you're ready now
Oh, as I'm ever gonna be
If you're with it then I'm with it now",Justin Bieber,2013,[59],1
100,Beware,"[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Yeah, praying to a sky all black
Looking at the stars like they finna talk back
Looking at my phone like she finna call back
But last night I feel like probably ended all that
'Cause by now, she woulda sent a text in all caps
Then another one tryna take it all back
Saying ""Fuck you,"" ""I miss you,"" or ""I hate you so much""
'Cause girls only say ""hate you"" to the guys that they love
I know, I know, I know
The highs, the lows it comes, it goes
You say ""Be real,"" I try, I don't
'Cause you take anything and just make it everything (God)
Kept my phone on silent ever since you got a ring, funny, right?
And I never cheated; I mean, maybe once or twice
One time don't change everything
She ask why I don't feel the same, I'm still the same
She's still insane and now she's saying

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

[Interlude: Big Sean]
Okay, skeet, smoke, sleep, call, miss, text, woke, spoke
Lie, feel, Lisa, ew, time, kill, months, still

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I got somebody baby mama calling me daddy (Yup)
I drank too much, please call me a cabby (Swerve)
Penthouse afterparty, hoes want the addy (Swerve)
Fuck, they can ride with us, crawl in a Caddy
Third row, that's when you call, I hit cancel
Really, I hit answer, fuck, I hate when that happens
Phone in my pocket for the whole night
And you heard bitches screaming 'til my phone died
Then she text me like, ""Why you still talk to my mama?
How the fuck you run around with condoms?
Why you make me get this tattoo? Man, fuck this tattoo
You the reason I wasn't single in college
What, all because I had you?
Nigga, I don't even have you
How I'm supposed to get past you?""
Then she called the next guy, spillin' some real shit
Now they problems that he got to deal with

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Girl, don't believe them hoes
'Cause they don't wanna see us together
And you already know you're too fly
But baby, don't get your hair caught in the propellers
I be tryna tell her these hoes is jealous
You know they never like it when you never say never
Long hair, red bone, but her pussy is hairless
Mwah, I french kiss it like we in Paris
I be screaming out, ""Ain't no woman like the one I got!""
But she be always worrying about the one I fucked
She said it's gonna be me, myself and I
Damn, that'd make me a one-eyed fuck
I was so mad
Damn, you used to ride a nigga like a moped
But players fuck up, my bad
And just to keep from crying, I laughed

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko, Lil Wayne, Big Sean, Jhené Aiko & Lil Wayne]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart (Tunechi)
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start (Damn)
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

[Outro: Jhené Aiko]

You love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love

[Verse 1: John Mayer]
My girl, she isn't the one
I saw coming
And sometimes I don't know which way to go
And I tried to run before
But I'm not running anymore
Because I've fought against it hard enough to know

If it's who you love
Then it's who you love

My boy ain't the one that I saw coming
And some have said his heart's too hard to hold
And it takes a little time
But you should see him when he shines
You never want to let that feeling go

When you love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love

103,Southern Girl,"[Verse 1]
Now I ain't sayin' them LA ladies don't know what they're doing
And I been in love with New York City a time or two
I had some Seattle coffee, some Chicago wind
Some Kansas sweet fields I'd love to see again
But the fireflies play where the cattails grow
And them southern girls, they talk nice and slow with

[Chorus]
Kisses sweeter than Tupelo honey
Little bit crazy like New Orleans
Memphis blue and Daytona sunny
Soft as cotton in some cutoff jeans
Don't you know
Ain't nothing in the whole wide world
Like a southern girl

[Post-Chorus]
Southern girl rock my world
Hazel eyes and golden curls
Put on a country song
We'll dance all night long

[Verse 2]
A southern girl's mama probably taught her how a lady should act
But a southern girl's probably got a barn somewhere reared out back
She'll get a little hay in her hair, her tires in the mud
She's been caught in the rain, and washed in the blood
Likes cherries in her coke, takes a little sip
Comes over to me with them sunburned lips and them

[Chorus]
Kisses sweeter than Tupelo honey
Little bit crazy like New Orleans
Memphis blue and Daytona sunny
Soft as cotton in some cutoff jeans
Don't you know
Ain't nothing in the whole wide world

If you've ever seen Savannah heat up when the stars come out
Well, then, fellas, come on, you know what I'm talking about

Explain it all, Ferguson
We ain't gotta sing the same old love song
Cut a white girl with the same black gloves on
Yeah, what you saying to it?
Old money look, no money don't do it
Make 'em turn around in their lane like a U-ie
And I'm only looking back if I'm looking at her booty
(At her booty) What's the rationale?
They wanna smoke niggas when they black & mild
So we acting out—okay, cool

Elle Varner, got a crush on her
I gotta wait in line for that

105,The Outsiders,"[Verse 1]
They’re the in crowd, we’re the other ones
It’s a different kind of cloth that we’re cut from
We let our colors show, where the numbers ain’t
With the paint where there ain’t supposed to be paint

That’s who we are
That’s how we roll
The Outsiders, The Outsiders

[Verse 2]
Our women get hot, and our leather gets stained
When we saddle up and ride 'em in the pouring rain
We’re the junkyard dogs, we’re the alley cats
Keep the wind at our front, and the hell at our back

That’s who we are
We do our talking, walk that walk
Wide open rocking
That’s how we roll

Our backs to the wall

We’re the bad news
We’re the young guns
We’re the ones that they told you to run from
Yeah, the player’s going to play, and a haters going to hate
And a regulators born to regulate

And the gloves come off

106,All The Way Home,"English translation (original lyrics in Creole)

You thought it wouldn't be hard
You thought you were strong enough
You thought you couldn't lose
Without lifting a finger

You thought you could do as you liked
And force the people to comply
You thought they would do as you say
But too many resisted

So now you're shamed, you lost, you fell
Now is the time for you to take your leave
Time’s up, you need to go

You thought yourself important 
You thought the people would love you
They don't want to see you here anymore
They want you to go back from where you came

All the way home

If you look deep inside your heart
You will surely find
This task wasn't yours to handle
Your ego made you stay

Don't lie, you must be sad at night
With all that has passed
It is not too late to leave it all
Just start walking

All the way home

You can take a motorbike
You can take a Vespa
You can even take a boat 
Or get a Honda 
You can even use your feet
If you want the time to meditate
The only thing we are asking
Is for you to go home

So now you're shamed, you lost, you fell
Now is the time for you to take your leave
Time’s up, you need to go

We say this to help you get your life back together
Leave with us what you can't do
Don't force it, just find your path
Get home safe

Ah
Please do whatever you need to
So that we don't see you anymore
We saw you too much
Ah
It is not your misfortune we want
We just don't want to see you anymore
We saw you too much",Bokanté,2013,[96],1

City's breaking down on a camel's back
They'll just have to go, 'cause they don't know wack
So all you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
You won't get undercounted 'cause you're damned and free
You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they come a kissin' 'cause I don't get sleep, no

Windmill, windmill for the land

What is there to moon glow, when love has passed you by
Then there came a midnight and the world was new
Now here am I so spellbound, darling
Not by stars, but just by you

At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over and life is like a song
At last the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover the night I looked at you
I found a dream that I can speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I've never known
You smiled and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
For you are mine at last

At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over and life is like a song
At last the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover the night I looked at you
I found a dream that I can speak to
A dream that I can call my own

A thrill I've never known

Who can say where the road goes
Where the day flows, only time
And who can say if your love grows
As your heart chose, only time

Who can say why your heart sighs
As your love flies, only time
And who can say why your heart cries
When your love lies, only time

Who can say when the roads meet
That love might be in your heart
And who can say when the day sleeps
If the night keeps all your heart
Night keeps all your heart

Who can say if your love grows
As your heart chose, only time
And who can say where the road goes

Now I'm gunnin' in the Benz and the Range too
I'm on point, know a nigga never take two
They said I couldn't reach Mars, so I turned to a star
Now I might have fucked around, might have raised up the bar
Now I'm talkin' cash, talk cash all in my palm
My nigga Cash said, ""Watch what they do for the ones""
I know she wanna be poppin' all over the 'Gram
When the cameras come out, wanna hold my hand

Man you're killin' my vibe, do you know who I am?

Now I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord

You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya

She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name

The holy or the broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool ya

I'll stand before the lord of song
With nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
Baby, I've been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
There was a time you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show it to me, do you?
And remember when I moved in you
The holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah",Leonard Cohen,2013,"[89, 40]",2

If it washes up at your feet then open it and read it
To whom it may concern, insert your name here
It's destiny that we were both born in the same year
Three months apart, but on the same sphere
Staring at the sun, inhaling the same air
This type of love we got, they'll never get it
I'll be the Leo DiCaprio to your Kate Winslet
Sometimes I panic, but I never take it for granted
I'll hold you 'til my lips turn blue like Jack in Titanic
And if I lose my grip, then just promise me this
You'll keep my love in a locket and always rock it, like

Making smart with their words again, well, I'm bored
Because I'm doing this for the thrill of it, killin' it

Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift + Ed Sheeran]
'Cause all I know is we said, ""Hello""
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

[Outro: Taylor Swift]
All I know is we said, ""Hello""
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days, I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed",Taylor Swift,2013,"[58, 55, 47, 37, 37, 32, 41, 45, 45, 42, 43, 49, 51, 56, 61, 61, 41, 79, 91]",19

Andiyan ka na naman
Ba't 'di ko maiwasang tumingin sa'yong liwanag
Nadarang nanaman sa'yong apoy
Bakit ba laging hinahayaan
Andiyan ka na naman
Ba't 'di ko maiwasang tumingin sa'yong liwanag
Nadarang nanaman sa'yong apoy
Handang masaktan kung kinakailangan

[Verse 1]
May lakad ka ba mamaya?
Puwede ka ba makasama sa pag-gagala
Kung sakaling 'di ka puwede
Sabagay, meron din akong ginagawa
Siguro nga napapaisip ka
Ba't ako nangangamusta
Ilang araw ka nang naroon sa panaginip ko
Nag-aalala lang ako baka sa'n ka mapunta
Pero mukhang ayos ka naman
Kahit 'di na kita abalahin pa
Ilang ama namin pa ba ang dapat
Para patago kang mag-alala sakin (uh)
Habang pinapantasya lamang nila
Ay mascara mo sa gabi At
Pitaka mo sa umaga
Yung ""ikaw"" sa likod ng kolorete
Pa din ang nangangahulugan
Sa salitang ""paraiso"" para sakin
Bakit kaya kayamanan ko pading kinikilala
Ang iyong pagtawa
Kahit na sa puso mo man ay
Ilang dosena na din ang kasya
Dati pa 'kong pinagdamutan ng kapalaran
Kaya 'di na bago sakin mawalan ng pag-asa
Ala-una ng umaga na naman
Tawagan mo na lang ulit ako
Kapag hindi na kayo magkasama

Andiyan ka na naman
Ba't di ko maiwasang tumingin sa'yong liwanag

Bakit ba laging hinahayaan
Andiyan ka na naman

Nadarang nanaman sa'yong apoy
Handang masaktan kung kinakailangan

[Verse 2]
May lakad ka ba mamaya
Sana madaanan mo ko pagkatapos
Sabihin mo ngayon ako'y makaka-asang
Dito ka dadalhin ng iyong sapatos
Kung ngayong gabi lang naman ang magiging dahilan
Ay handang-handa padin naman ako mamaos
Nakakaluwag ka man ay sa mas
Nakakalibang na paraan kita tutulungang makaraos
Bakit ka nagparamdam
Siguro 'di na kayo nilanggam
Ba't kaya 'di niya alam
Ang iyong halaga't kung ga'no ka kalinamnam
Iniwasan ko ma'ng matakam nang di halata
Ang hirap na magpabaya
Kapag tawag na ng laman ay nagbadya
Makipaglangit-lupa ng walang taya
Mata sa mata, bibig sa bibig
Mga ingay na tayo lang dalawa nakadinig
Nakatawang umidlip sa kama
Pero ba't wala ka na pagsapit ng umaga?

Slide over, we slip out to the outskirts of town

I got a blanket and a fifth of Comfort
A little something to knock off the edge
It’s supposed to get a little cool tonight
Looks like I’m going to have to hold you tight, yeah

About a mile off Old Mill Road
In that spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off running
Hurry up, girl I hear it coming
Got a moon and a billion stars

The thought of you is driving me insane
Come on baby, let’s go listen to the night train

Yeah, I hope it’s gonna be a long one
And if we’re lucky, it’s moving slow
I wouldn’t mind if it lasted all night
Lying next to you on that hillside

Hola, me llaman Romeo
Es un placer conocerla

Qué bien te ves
Te adelanto, no me importa quien sea él
Dígame usted, si ha hecho algo travieso alguna vez
Una aventura es más divertida si huele a peligro

[Estribillo]
¿Si te invito a una copa y me acerco a tu boca
Si te robo un besito, a ver, te enojas conmigo?
¿Qué dirías si esta noche te seduzco en mi coche?
Que se empañen los vidrios y la regla es que goces
¿Si te falto el respeto y luego culpo al alcohol
Si levanto tu falda, me darías el derecho
A medir tu sensatez?
Poner en juego tu cuerpo
¿Sí te parece prudente esta propuesta indecente?

[Verso 2]
A ver, a ver, permíteme apreciar tu desnudez (Take it off)
Relájate, que este Martini calmará tu timidez (Don't be shy)

141,Bad Day,"[Verse 1]
Where is the moment we needed the most?
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
They tell me your blue skies fade to gray
They tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carryin' on

[Verse 2]
You stand in the line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with the coffee to go
You tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carryin' on

[Chorus]
Because you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me, don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

142,A Case Of You,"[Verse 1]
Just before our love got lost you said
""I am as constant as a northern star""
And I said, ""Constantly in the darkness
Where's that at?
If you want me I'll be in the bar""
On the back of a cartoon coaster
In the blue TV screen light
I drew a map of Canada
Oh, Canada
With your face sketched on it twice

[Chorus]
Oh, you are in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling
And I would still be on my feet
Oh, I would still be on my feet

[Verse 2]
Oh, I am a lonely painter
I live in a box of paints
I'm frightened by the devil
And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid
I remember that time you told me, you said
""Love is touching souls""
Surely you touched mine
'Cause part of you pours out of me
In these lines from time to time

[Chorus]
Oh, you are in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling
Still I'd be on my feet
I would still be on my feet

[Verse 3]
I met a woman
She had a mouth like yours
She knew your life
She knew your devils and your deeds
And she said
""Go to him, stay with him if you can
But be prepared to bleed""

[Chorus]
Oh, but you are in my blood, you are my holy wine
You're so bitter, bitter and so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling
Still I'd be on my feet
I would still be on my feet",Joni Mitchell,2013,[72],1
143,All Kinds Of Kinds,"[Verse 1]
Ilsa was an acrobat who went and fell in love with that
Horatio the human cannonball
A wedding 'neath the big top tent with barkers clowns and elephants
Sideshow family oddities and all
The dog-faced boy howled out with joy
As the tattooed lady was crying
Ever since the beginning to keep the world spinning
It takes all kinds of kinds

[Verse 2]
Thomas was a congressman with closets full of skeletons
And dresses that he wore on Friday nights
Phyllis was a pharmacist, a dab of that, a pinch of this
Concocted to suppress her appetite
When the children were fiddling she'd slip 'em some Ritalin
And wait for Thomasina to arrive
Cause ever since the beginning to keep the world spinning
It takes all kinds of kinds
All kinds of kinds

[Verse 3]
When I play this old guitar from children's shows to smoky bars
I take a break and think about the past
When I stood up in geometry and everybody stared at me
And I tossed my test into the trash
I scratched off my number while hitching out under
That bush league population sign
Ever since the beginning to keep the world spinning
It takes all kinds of kinds

[Outro]
Now some point a finger and let ignorance linger
If they'd look in the mirror they'd find
That ever since the beginning to keep the world spinning
It takes all kinds of kinds

Lunch with a few Mai Tais
Purple kisses on my tie
Life can’t really predict love
Now you’re getting this dick, love
I’m looking for you with a flashlight
I want to feel what a real fat ass feel like
No injection, I learned my lesson

Pussy pop like (boom!) go get me a burner

146,Beautiful Pain,"[Intro: Eminem and Sia]
I can feel the heat risin'
Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder
Of why we can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
Lookin' out, ‘cause—

[Hook: Sia]
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yesterday was the tornado warning, today's like the morning after
Your world is torn in half, you wake in its wake to start the
Mourning process, and rebuilding, you're still a work in progress
Today's a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous ass, uh
Thunderstorm has passed ya, you weathered it
And poked its eye out with the thorn bush that you used to smell the roses
Stopped to inhale, can't even tell your nose is
Stuffed, so focused on the bright side then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner faster, more assertive, never looking back
May hit the curb, but every day is a new learning curve as you
Steer through life, sometimes you might not wanna swerve, but you have to
To avert a disaster, lucky no permanent damage
‘Cause they hurt you so bad it's like they murdered your ass
And threw dirt on your casket but you've returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past standing at inferno and chant

[Hook: Sia]
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You're so familiarized with what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died ‘cause you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive, which means you will survive
Although today you may weep ‘cause you're weak
And everything seems so bleak and hopeless, the light that you're seekin'
It begins to seep in; that's the only thing keepin'
You from leapin' off the mothafreakin' deep end
And I'm pullin' for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healing and by tomorrow
You may even feel so good that you're willing to forgive 'em
Even after all the shit you been put through, this feeling of resilience is building
And the flames are burning quick as fire would through this building
You're sealed in, but you're fireproof, flame retardant, you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof, you're just chillin', you look down
‘Cause you're so over 'em you could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling

[Bridge: Eminem]
As time passes, things change every day
But wounds, wounds heal, but scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow, today's going down in flames
Throw the match, set the past ablaze

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So feel the fire beneath your feet as you barely even
Perspire from the heat, exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief it's like watching the walls
Melt in your prison cell, but you've extinguished this livin' hell
Still, a little piece of you dies as you scream—

[Hook: Sia]
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

[Bridge: Sia]
I feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
I have learned from fighting fights that weren't mine
It's not with fists, but with wings that I will fly

[Hook: Sia]
And I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light",Eminem,2013,[99],1

First, I'll acknowledge, all trust has been broken
A successful recovery, I pray for us at night
Bless me with a second chance, never thought I’d see your face again
Learn a lot through trial and error, tryna make it right
Make it right, make it right
Make it right, this time I'll do you right, woah

[Verse 1]
I'm missing your good intentions, I'm missing you from a distance
Hope you did the same
I know that I caused a problem, know that I left you livid
Pushed you far away
Learned it don’t pay to lie cause I don’t wanna see you cry
Saying nothing gets you nowhere fast, I'mma hold it back inside
Well now that I'm back around ya, nothing else really matters
Hope you feel the same

I'm going through old emotions, tryna find a reason
That we ended that way
Nothing in life is perfect, we'll be changing like the seasons
That's what they used to say
If it's going to sleep alone at night, I don’t wanna close my eyes
Wanna give you all I have to give, no more holding back this time
Well now that I'm back around ya, nothing around me matters
Hope you feel the same

A successful recovery, I pray for us at night

It's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between your eyes
You're paralyzed

[Chorus 1: Michael Jackson]
'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller
Thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah, ooh

You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination
Girl, but all the while
You hear a creature creeping up behind
You're out of time

[Chorus 2: Michael Jackson]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance
Against the thing with 40 eyes, girl

Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time
They're open wide
This is the end of your life, ooh

They're out to get you
There's demons closing in on every side, ooh
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see

That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try

Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
(Thriller, ooh, thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
(Thriller night, thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Ooh, babe, I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller night, babe
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of 40 thousand years (Thriller night, thriller)
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller!

[Verse 1]
High dive into frozen waves where the past comes back to life
Fight fear for the selfish pain, it was worth it every time
Hold still right before we crash 'cause we both know how this ends
Our clock ticks 'til it breaks your glass and I drown in you again

[Chorus]
'Cause you are the piece of me I wish I didn't need
Chasing relentlessly, still fight and I don't know why

If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?

If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?

Walk on through a red parade and refuse to make amends
It cuts deep through our ground and makes us forget all common sense
Don't speak as I try to leave 'cause we both know what we'll choose
If you pull, then I'll push too deep and I'll fall right back to you

[Chorus]
'Cause you are the piece of me I wish I didn't need

Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
They tell me I should fix my grill ‘cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing, but it's funny how
My shit is crooked—look at how far I done got without it!
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect, but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Though you a woman I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you, killin' yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on
Stare in the mirror, but it's clear that you can’t face what’s wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paintbrush on
Your roommate yelling, ""Why you gotta take so long?!""
What it's like to have a crooked smile

[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson (J. Cole)]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down (This crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round (Yeah)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard, my darling
You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
You keep falling victim ‘cause you're insecure
And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure
‘Cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you askin'
So all you see is what you lackin', not what you packin'
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl, you a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair
Is it real? If it's not, girl, you don't care
‘Cause what's real is somethin' that the eyes can't see
That the hands can’t touch, that them broads can’t be
And that’s you, never let 'em see your frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up, I’ll be around
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
I can tell you ain’t laughed in a while
But I wanna see that crooked smile

[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Post-Chorus: J. Cole T-Boz & Chilli]
We got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em
Back round, crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
We don't look nothin' like the people on the screen
You know, the movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase ‘em
Look at the nation
That’s a crooked smile braces couldn’t even straighten
Seem like half the race is either on probation or in jail
Wonder why we inhale, ‘cause we in Hell already
I ask: If my skin pale, would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?
But one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga, let’s make a mil
Hey officer man, we don’t want nobody gettin' killed
Just open up that cell, let my brother outta jail
I got money for the bail now, and well now
If you askin' will I tell now—ayy, hell nah
I ain’t snitchin' 'cause, man, they get them niggas stitches now
If you was around then you wouldn’t need a witness now
How you like this crooked smile?

[Chorus: T-Boz, Chilli & Jennifer Hudson (J. Cole)]
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down (That crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

[Post-Chorus: J. Cole T-Boz & Chilli]

Return of the Mack
Get 'em, what it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up outta bed
Instead of getting on the Internet
And checking on who hit me, get up
Thrift shop, pimp-strut walkin'
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope nope, y'all can't copy, yeah
Bad, moonwalking, this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the four-track, bussin'
Halfway cross that city with the back (back) pack (pack), fat (fat) cat (cat), crushin'

Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that’s what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me
Go hard like I got a 808 in my heartbeat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw!
Time to go off, I'm gone
Deuces, goodbye, I got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now sing a song, and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party (Hey, hey, hey)
We came here to live life like nobody was watching (Hey, hey, hey, oh)
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me (Hey, hey, hey)
Learn from that failure, gain humility (Hey, hey, hey)
And then we keep marching, I said

Come hold me, please, and never let me go
On that second day of Christmas
Said you felt like something's missing
So you promised me that promise ring to keep 'til we get old, boy

[Pre-Chorus]
On that third day of Christmas
We got all in our feelings
Said ""I love you"" and meant it, oh
On the fourth, we committed
Any time, he could get it
He's the real one, I know it

[Chorus]
Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love, my true love
You are my true love
Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love, my true love
You are my true love
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, oh-oh, ah-ah, ah-ah
You are my true love

[Verse 2]
On the fifth day of Christmas
You asked me what's on my wishlist
And I told you all I wanted was forever with my boo
After six days in your arms
I got that tattoo on my heart
'Cause I'm your moonlight, you're my star
Ain't nothin' shining more than you, boy

[Pre-Chorus]
You completed the vision
Now I feel like I'm living
You're so one in a million, oh-oh
I'm so glad we committed
Any time, he could get it
He's the real one, I know it

[Chorus]
Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love
You are my true love
You are my true love
Look at all the things my true love gave to me
(You are my true love)
My true love, my true love
You are my true love

You are my true love",Ariana Grande,2013,"[84, 77, 59, 55, 53, 57, 58, 54, 62, 61, 59, 60, 69, 85]",14

I know they think I get around
You and I
Got something they can't know about
Really only heaven knows my heart

You know this ain't an ordinary love
We got so much histray in the stories about us

157,Closer,"[Verse 1: Andrew Taggart]
Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much
And that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends
It was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

[Pre-Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

[Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

[Post-Chorus: Andrew Taggart]
We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

[Verse 2: Halsey]
You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no call
Now I'm lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer

Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight, that hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go

[Verse 1]
Don't let this go to your head
But you're the best I've ever had
Not to mention that thing is swollen
You got me oh so in a trance
Something like a ziploc, but a lip lock
Want you wrapped around my arm like a wrist watch
Oh so hard walking out
Got me stuck like krazy glue, ooh

Ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go

[Verse 2]
Got me tossing turning in the bed
Your place is where I'd rather be instead
You don't know your strength
Missing you is like adrenaline
Ooh when you got me in a gridlock, what a great spot
With a turned up kind of loving, it just won't stop
No, so hard walking out
Got me stuck like krazy glue, ooh-wee

Them lips won't let me go

Oh baby, holding back the faces I would make
I'm a fan and you're the rockstar, making it hard on me
Visualise a monster, cause you're too bad for me

So don't mind if I turn away, no no
I try to maintain
So don't mind if I turn away, ooh

159,Sweeter Than Fiction,"[Verse 1]
Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground (oh, oh)
Only sound, only sound that you hear is ""no""
You never saw it coming
Slipped when you started running
And now you've come undone and (I, I, I)
Seen you fall, seen you crawl on you knees (eh, eh)
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
Wish I could make it better
Someday you won't remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever

[Chorus 1]
There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, ""I knew it all along""
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction

[Verse 2]
Just a shot, just a shot in the dark (oh, oh)
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it coming
You hit the ground running
And now you're on to something
I, I, I say
What a sight, what a sight when the light came on
Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
And in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever

[Chorus 2]
There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, ""I knew it all along""
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction
There you stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction, fiction

[Bridge]
I’ll be one of the many saying
Look at you now, look at you now, now
I’ll be one of the many saying
You made us proud, you made us proud, proud
I’ll be one of the many saying
Look at you now, look at you now, now
I’ll be one of the many saying
You made us proud, you made us proud, proud
And when they call your name
And they put your picture in a frame
You know that I’ll be there time and again
'Cause I loved you when
When you hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you heard was ""no""
Now in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever

[Chorus 2]
There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, ""I knew it all along""
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction
There you stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction, fiction",Taylor Swift,2013,[34],1
160,Cups (Pitch Perfect's When I'm Gone),"[Prologue]

[Mike]
June 9th, 1958
Detective Turrano, Detective Castillo and I
Had been private investigators
In the city for three years

[Saverio]
We worked tirelessly around the clock
To keep the scum of society off the streets
And by tirelessly
I mean it was exhausting
And I fucking hated it

[Brandon]
Our office was our home
We ate there, slept there
And on occasion
Brought foxy ladies to get some mad puss
All in the name of justice of course

[Saverio]
Boy, don’t act like you’ve had sex in our office
The pillow you practice kissing on
Wouldn’t even let you smash

[Brandon]
Nah, I’ve totally gotten laid in here
That couch has been dampened
With the juices of a good time

[Mike]
Who did you fuck in here?
Give me one name and I’ll believe you

[Brandon]
Uhh… I don’t wanna say

[Mike]
Augh uh yeah
That's what I thought
Anyway, June 9th, 1958
The day we faced a mystery most mystifying
Of foul play most foul


[Scene 1]

[Brandon]
Somebody knocked

[Mike]
Great observation, no shit Sherlock

[Brandon]
You don’t have to be rude

[Mike]
Just open the door

[Brandon]
Okay, I’mma open the door

[Saverio]
Hold up, wait!

[Brandon]
Then Saverio tackles me onto the floor
What the fuck man?

[Saverio]
I think that this could be a trap of some sort
Who the hell comes here at eight in the morn?

[Mike]
What the hell do you mean?

[Saverio]
I mean that this could be
A part of some criminal’s villainous scheme
We’ve caught a lot of bad guys
Made a lot of enemies
Someone could want revenge
And my gut is telling me
Not to let this guy in

[Mike]
Turrano
You're making a lot of assumptions
It’s probably a client
I open the door to discover
The face of my former lover
Flashback plays in my head like a picture show
Whole thing started ‘bout a year ago
When I met her
I was on my way to get coffee
Asked her name, she said...

[Audrey]
Audrey

[Mike]
She's into music, paintings, burgers
Also she fucked like a monster, holy shit
I can’t believe I was tapping that
I’m pitching a tent
Just thinking bout those massive…

[Audrey]
Detective
What are you staring at?

[Mike]
Huh?

[Audrey]
Excuse me
My eyes are up here

[Mike]
Wait no! I wasn’t staring at your...
I was thinking about some
Other
Shit…
Anyway, why are you here?

[Audrey]
Something dreadful has happened!
I need you to help…
Um…
Is there any particular reason
Those two are laying
On top of each other on the floor?

[Brandon]
Sav! Get the fuck off me!

[Mike]
Brandon and Saverio try to play it cool
As if they didn’t just
Remind us all of Gomorrah and Sodom

[Saverio]
Mike covers up his obvious erection
And Brandon chimes in with a...

[Brandon]
So, what seems to be the problem?

[Audrey]
It’s a really ridiculous story
It’s insane, but you’ve got to believe it

[Saverio]
What happened?

[Audrey]
My husband awoke in the morning
To find that his face had been covered in semen

[Brandon]
Fucking what?

[Mike]
Brandon, quit laughing

[Brandon]
I’m sorry but something about
The thought of waking up
With a mysterious hot wad of jizz on your face
Is pretty fucking funny

[Mike]
I apologize for him
But at any rate
We need to hear more specifics of the case

[Saverio]
For instance
You said that your husband’s the victim
As in, you have a husband?
You’re married?
Like, off the market?

[Audrey]
Yes, my husband was screaming
It sounded as if he was dying
I found him lying on the floor crying
In fetal position
Covered in testicular drippings
And I didn’t know what to do

[Mike]
Well, where did it come from?

[Audrey]
I don’t have clue

[Saverio]
Well, it's gotta be someone's

[Brandon]
Perhaps it was his

[Audrey]
I love him but trust me
His dick ain’t that big

[Brandon]
This is a mystery

[Saverio]
Vicious and errant

[Mike]
But I wonder
The victim, your husband
Why isn’t he here?

[Audrey]
Well, he’s far too embarrassed
To talk about even a word of what happened

[Brandon]
Psh, I bet

[Audrey]
He doesn’t even know that I’m here
But this criminal has to be thwarted
Find me the fucker who came on my man
And I promise you three will be greatly rewarded

[Saverio]
Uh, can you give us a second?

[Audrey]
Of course

[Brandon]
Yo, she totally just offered us a foursome
If we crack this case!

[Mike]
She said nothing like that, Castillo

[Brandon]
Body language, Moore!
Her lips said reward
But her eyes said
Three throbbing man pills
All over my body

[Mike]
You still convinced this is some convict
Trying to get revenge on us, Turrano?

[Saverio]
Okay, I was wrong about that
She’s definitely telling the truth
I’ve been reading the news
There have actually been
Three other reports of men
Waking up with jean cream on their faces

[Mike]
So we can’t talk to Audrey’s husband
Because he’s too macho
To talk about having baby batter in his beard
But there’s three other guys
We can get clues from
Castillo, get the rolodex
And figure out where we can find them

[Brandon]
On it

[Mike]
Audrey?

[Audrey]
Yes?

[Mike]
Stay here in our office
We've got a case to crack


[Scene 2]

[Saverio]
First victim on the case we gotta crack
Local rockabilly singer
By the name of Scotty Black
I found him in the trailer
That he uses for a home
Cause he barely makes a living off his music
I knock knocked and his door and he said

[Scotty Black (Niko Lento)]
You’re not my ecstasy dealer

[Saverio]
Okay lemme try that again
I said
My name is Detective Turrano
And I’m here to ask you
A couple of questions
He came back to the door and said

[Scotty]
Are you a cop?

[Saverio]
I’m a private investigator
I’m not a cop

[Scotty]
Okay, good
Come on inside
What do you need?

[Saverio]
I’m here to ask about the time
That you woke up with your face
All covered in nut

[Scotty]
Okay that shit was fucked up
Every night when I’m done with the show
I go back to my trailer
With a bunch of hoes
We get super drunk
And we all smash

[Saverio]
This surprised me
Considering his music is trash

[Scotty]
The last time that we all got busy
I woke up in the morning
With my mouth all jizzy
And even though I was highly intoxicated
I swear that I was the only man there

[Saverio]
I see
Does anybody know about the orgies?

[Scotty]
Everybody knows about the orgies
They used to be a secret
Before she found out

[Saverio]
Wait, who is this you’re talking bout?

[Scotty]
My fiancé
Ex-fiancé
She had the biggest tits
I ever laid eyes on
But she walked in on me
Fucking half a dozen other women at a time
Now that girl’s long gone
She kept her key to my trailer though
To me that means there’s a ray of hope
That she might come back to me one day, and...

[Saverio]
Nope
You fucked up pretty bad, dude
She prolly threw that key in the trash, dude
Just being real
You fucked six other people
She prolly isn’t considering coming back, dude
That prolly isn’t something
You should get attached to
Sorry

[Scotty]
I guess that’s true
I should write a song about that
Lemme get my guitar real quick

[Saverio]
Please don’t

[Scotty]
You left
With a key
Never gonna come back
Misery

[Frantic Knocker (Billy Platt)]
Scotty!
I got the shit!
Hurry up
I think I might have been tailed

[Saverio]
Who the fuck is that?

[Scotty]
That’s my ecstasy dealer


[Scene 3]

[Mike]
Stop two on the track to answers
Impressionist painter
Named Jackson Krasner
He’s got a studio at the edge of the city
So I went there in a cab
Hoping he would chat with me
I knock knocked on his door and he said

[Jackson Krasner (Henry Moore)]
Tony?
You’re here sooner than expected

[Mike]
I told him
My name is Detective Moore
And I’m here to ask you
A couple of questions

[Jackson]
Oh, I don’t have time for an interview
I’m a hurry
I’ve got more important shit to do

[Mike]
I’m sorry, is justice a disturbance?

[Jackson]
Oh fine, talk to me while I’m working

[Mike]
I get distracted when I glance at his canvas
And it’s just splatters of paint
I don’t understand it
So I ask him
What does this mean?

[Jackson]
Ah, allow me to paint you a scene
I could never be in love
Maybe for the inspiration
I’d pretend to
I started dating and painting a lady
And then a few exhibits made a fortune
There were many men
Who’d commission naked portraits of her
Telling me to send nudes
She had these immaculate breasts
That practically leapt
Onto the canvas and back again
Living the life
Cashing that check
Having the best passionate sex
Until the day she got mad and she left
While he was explaining
He very casually continued his painting
By taking his brush
And waving it front to back
With a quick thrusting action
And it honestly looked like
He was jacking his dick
And I have to admit
It was distracting a bit
Like, why’s he gotta be so fucking weird
I can tell by the way he acts
This guy’s the final nail in the coffin proving
Artists are fucking maniacs
Then he said

[Jackson]
Without her
I needed a fresh start
So I made a habit out of sleeping the park
You know what they say
About nature and art
Maybe if I got in touch with the Earth
It would unlock an unharnessed art in my head
But I ended up soaking in splewage instead
It was wretched
But in my reflection
I saw an opportunity for expression
So I harnessed inspiration
From the embarrassment felt
In the splattering pattern
To bring forth a style that’s never been done
And that is the essence I’ve attempted to capture

[Mike]
So this is a painting of you
Drenched in dubious daddy deposits?

[Jackson]
It isn’t about the jizz
It’s about making you feel like you’re covered in jizz

[Mike]
Okay I’ve had enough
I’m going back to the…
Ah shit
I left my key to the office behind
I’m gonna have to wait up for the others

[Tony (Nathan Moore)]
Excuse me Jackson
Is my painting ready?

[Jackson]
Tony!
Perfect timing
I just finished it
How does it make you feel?

[Tony]
It sorta makes me feel like I’m covered in jizz
And I love it


[Scene 4]

[Brandon]
Number three
Last but not least
A fast food chef
Named Richard Maurice
Reputed as a bad worker
I went to his apartment
After his shift of flipping burgers
I knock knocked on his door and he said
...ahem...
I knock knocked on his door and he said
...
Where the hell is this guy?
He should be home by this time
I gave the doorknob a try
And it was unlocked
So I wandered inside
Small place, that’s for sure
Found some dude
Asleep on the floor
It’s prolly Richard
Gotta wake him up
Subtly nudge him, don’t startle him

[Richard Maurice (Anthony Chidichimo)]
I don't wanna get married!

[Brandon]
Oh shit!

[Richard Maurice]
Hello
Do...
Do I know you?

[Brandon]
My name is Detective Castillo
And I’m here to ask you
A couple of questions

[Richard]
Oh
How did you get in here?

[Brandon]
The door wasn’t locked

[Richard]
Son of a bitch
I thought that I locked it
I must’ve forgot
I do that shit all the time

[Brandon]
Sir, I need to ask about
The day you woke up
With stud crud on your face

[Richard]
That’s kinda weird
But go ahead, ask away

[Brandon]
Did you see the perp?

[Richard]
I forget

[Brandon]
Were you followed home?

[Richard]
I forget

[Brandon]
Was your door locked?

[Richard]
I forget

[Brandon]
Is there anything that you remember?

[Richard]
Hmm…
I remember going to the sperm bank
Like I do on every Thursday
Boutta donate
When I overheard the clerk say
Something bout a man
With a mask and a gun
Coming through and
Demanding a gallon of cum

[Brandon]
Oh shit, what happened?

[Richard]
They gave it to him

[Brandon]
Is that how sperm banks work?
Do they just have, like, jugs full of dude glue?

[Richard]
Yeah

[Brandon]
One more thing before I go
What did you mean
You don’t wanna get married?

[Richard]
I'm sorry?

[Brandon]
When you woke up
You said I don’t wanna get married

[Richard]
Oh
I was reliving a moment
I had with an ex
Girl had a monstrous chest
She wanted me to marry her
But I just kinda wanted her for sex
Why do you ask?

[Brandon]
No reason


[Scene 5]

[Mike]
After a long day of tracking down
And interviewing the three other victims
We regrouped and returned to our office
To put our facts together
And deduce what could have happened

[Saverio]
We returned to find Audrey
Sitting on one of the couches
She stood up as soon as she saw us
And I take no shame in saying that
I stood up as soon as I saw her

[Brandon]
You know
All day I’ve been laughing to myself
About the sentiment of waking up and going
Oh, what’s this on my face?
Did I drool or something?
And then looking in the mirror and going
Where the fuck did this willy milk come from?

[Mike]
Audrey approached us
As we entered the room and said

[Audrey]
So what happened?
Did you catch him?

[Mike]
Well, we've talked to a lot of guys
And we certainly have a lot to think about
But we haven’t caught him yet
We’re getting close though

[Saverio]
It’s all so confusing
The victims have almost nothing in common
We’ve got no leads on any suspects
And then there’s the whole sperm bank thing

[Audrey]
Sperm bank?
Were you guys jacking off into cups all day?

[Brandon]
No
One of the victims mentioned that
Somebody robbed a sperm bank
Left with a ton of semen
And we’re completely blown away
At the odds of there being
Two nut butter related crimes in the same week

[Audrey]
What an incredible coincidence

[Saverio]
Well, maybe not
We think they could be related

[Mike]
We’re gonna sleep on it though
You head on home
And come back tomorrow morning
We’ll have more to tell you then

[Audrey]
You’re gonna make me walk home all alone?

[Brandon]
I'll walk you home

[Mike]
Castillo, she’s a grown ass woman
She can walk her damn self home
Good night, Audrey

[Audrey]
Good night detectives. Sleep well


[Scene 6]

[Mike]
I didn't sleep well
As a matter of fact
I didn't sleep at all
I hadn't relaxed a single muscle
Since I stepped into the ring to tussle
One on one with this
Most brain teasing puzzle
I've been pacing in my room in the office
With nothing at all
I'm stuck at a wall
I'm clutching at straws
I can't spin it to gold
Unless something, anything
Points to a suspect
I hear my door slowly open behind me
Dreadfully I turn around to find
The silhouette of a sinister figure
Creeping with a comically large syringe
Labeled as semen
He must have heard
About our journey to convict him
But the only ones who know that we're involved
Are the victims
Suddenly the truth becomes blaring
The son of a bitch
Served us a red herring
He slams the door shut between us
He's trying to escape
My feet throw me forward toward the door
As I start to chase after him
This could be our chance
To put an end to this case
All I have to do is
Get one glance at his face
I catapult the door open to find
This crafty bastard had the bright idea
Of closing the blinds
The whole room is pitch black
So he knows he can hide
Oh, shit
With my arms thrown in front of me
I start slowly stumbling through the room
In an attempt to find him
Preparing myself for this to get violent
Suddenly my hand lands on something
Holy shit
I've got him right where I want him
I've got him guys
Oh
Oh God he got me
Oh I'm covered in jizz
*vomits
He's blinded me with man chowder
I can't see
He's gonna get away
Guys, wake up

[Brandon]
What the fuck happened?

[Mike]
He was here
He was here, I saw him

[Saverio]
Who?

[Mike]
The Phantom Masturbator!

[Saverio]
Is that what we’re calling him?

[Brandon]
See I was gonna suggest we call him
Rip The Jacker
You know like Jack The Ripper
Only sexier

[Mike]
Shut the fuck up
That bastard plastered his
Population paste all over my face
Would one of you please get me
Something I can wipe it off with

[Saverio]
Here, take a tissue

[Mike]
Thank you
I pulled the tissue across my eyes
And suddenly I regained both my vision
And my composure
Now gentlemen
We’ve got ourselves a situa-
Holy shit!

[Saverio]
Whoah whoah
What happened?

[Mike]
Castillo!

[Brandon]
What?

[Mike]
You’ve got spunk on your face too!

[Brandon]
What?
I pressed my hands against my face
And felt a sticky squishing
Ah!

[Mike]
He got you too!

[Brandon]
This is fucked up!

[Mike]
Believe me, I know!

[Saverio]
Sucks to be you guys

[Brandon]
Okay, no more fucking around!
That motherfucker done made this shit personal!

[Saverio]
Look, we’ve interviewed all the victims
And we don’t have a single solid suspect

[Mike]
Well, not all the victims

[Saverio]
You mean Audrey’s husband?

[Brandon]
He may hold the key to finding this guy

[Saverio]
Audrey told us he’s too embarrassed to talk about it
He won’t tell us anything!

[Brandon]
Fuck that!
I'm calling his ass

[Audrey's Husband (Kyle Caccamesi)]
Hello?

[Brandon]
Hi, is this Audrey’s husband?

[Audrey's Husband]
Yes, and it’s four in the morning
Who is this?

[Brandon]
My name is Detective Brandon Castillo
Your wife came to our office and told us
That you woke up covered in ball barf
She said you wouldn’t want to talk about it
But I’ve got jizz on my face as we speak
And if we’re gonna catch
The son of a bitch who did this to us
You’ve gotta tell me everything

[Audrey's Husband]
I have no idea what you’re talking about
I never woke up with semen on my face

[Brandon]
You guys hear that?

[Saverio]
But Audrey told us…

[Brandon]
Sir, is your wife with you?

[Audrey's Husband]
No, I don’t know where she is
Did you say you have jizz on your face right now?

[Mike]
Son of a bitch

[Saverio]
I know
Brandon totally just told that guy
He had chode nectar on his face
For nothing

[Mike]
No, not for nothing
I think we just solved the case


[Scene 7]

[Brandon]
That morning
Audrey returned to our office
As we had instructed her to
She said

[Audrey]
Is there anything new you’ve deduced?

[Saverio]
Well, as a matter of fact
We’ve identified our man
And we’ve got the proof

[Audrey]
Excellent news!
You must tell me who

[Mike]
Only one man had a motive
And that man…
Was you

[Audrey]
Me? What?

[Brandon]
Do you deny it?

[Audrey]
Yes I deny it!

[Saverio]
We figured you would

[Audrey]
Of course I deny it!
I don’t have a penis with which to ejaculate!
I hired you men to extrapolate
Who could have masturbated on my husband
And somehow you advocate that it was me?

[Mike]
That’s quite enough of the charade
We know it was you
Allow us to explain
None of the victims
Had seen the suspect

[Saverio]
But all of the victims
Had mentioned an ex
All of them said

[Brandon]
Girl had a monstrous chest

[Mike]
Immaculate breasts

[Saverio]
She had the biggest tits I ever laid eyes on

[Mike]
We believe you are the ex
And that you’ve been getting
Sexual revenge

[Brandon]
You dressed like a man
With a mask and a gun
And you robbed the sperm bank
Of a gallon of cum

[Saverio]
Past that point
All you had to do was track down Scotty

[Mike]
Jackson

[Brandon]
Richard

[Mike]
And me

[Saverio]
You kept your key to Scotty’s trailer, though

[Mike]
Jackson made a habit
Out of sleeping in the park

[Brandon]
And Richard left his door open
Be probably thought that he locked it
He must have forgot

[Saverio]
That much of your plan was flawless

[Mike]
But since I’m always in this office
Getting to me would be harder to do
So you concocted a ruse

[Saverio]
Something dreadful has happened
You told us knowing your state of distress
Was extremely deceiving

[Brandon]
You lied that your husband awoke in the morning
To find that his face had been covered in semen

[Saverio]
And it was remarkably simple
Avoiding suspicion by playing the victim

[Mike]
I have to admit that was smart
But you knew that your lie
Would crumble apart
If we spoke to your husband

[Saverio]
You knew we would try

[Brandon]
So you had to convince us
He wouldn’t comply

[Saverio]
You told us
He’s far too embarrassed
To talk about even a word of what happened

[Brandon]
We were sold
We began the search

[Mike]
And as we ran around town
Tryna interview the victims
Little did we know that we left the perp
Sitting on a couch
All alone on our own turf

[Saverio]
That gave you plenty of time
To comb through the office

[Brandon]
You wanted to find a key
So at night you could come back inside

[Mike]
And lucky for you I had left mine behind

[Brandon]
You returned that night in disguise

[Brandon]
Mike woke up and you ran outside

[Mike]
I pursued you until you shot cream in my eyes
And just like that you had won your prize
You got to reciprocate for the
Men you allowed to nut on your face

[Brandon]
And you thought that we couldn’t
Connect all the clues
But thanks to your husband
We know it was you
Do you deny it?

[Audrey]
I…
I...

[Mike]
Audrey
Do you deny it?

[Audrey]
I just wanted someone to love me
You may find it overdramatic
But love is uncommon
When you’re as attractive as I am
Nobody wants to be close
They just wanna fuck you and leave you
So they deceive you
Mislead you into feeling like they need you
But when you satisfy their sweet-tooth
They just treat you like a tuft of dust
And sweep you under the rug, it sucks
You don’t know what it’s like to be used
But now that I’m married
I had to atone for the
Sexual favors that went undeserved
You and the rest of the lecherous men
I had sex with have suffered revenge
And as far as I’m concerned
You all got what you earned
So go ahead and cuff me
I’m sure that’ll get you off

[Mike]
Audrey
We’re letting you go

[Audrey]
Wait, really?

[Brandon]
Yeah
We put all the pieces together
And realized that
Finally you had a love that was true
And who would we be
To undo that for you?

[Saverio]
Plus, we don’t have any physical evidence
None of this theory would hold up in court

[Mike]
And I know that it’s partly my fault
For sending you on a
Rampage of sexual assault
I’m sorry, Audrey
But like
If you're
Not
Doing
Anything
Later
Do you
Maybe
Wanna...

[Audrey]
Motherfucker
I know you did not just try that shit

[Mike]
Uh, I know, I know
I'm an asshole
I'm sorry

[Audrey]
Remember
I’ve still got half a gallon of cock frosting
With your name on it
If any of you three
Ever say anything about this to anyone
You hear?

[Mike]
Crystal clear Audrey
We're keeping it zipped

[Audrey]
Good
Now I’m gonna go home
And fuck my husband


[Epilogue]

[Mike]
And thus was the conclusion
Of one of the most challenging cases of our careers
I'd say all loose ends
Tied up pretty nicely
Except for maybe one thing
Audrey was getting revenge
On the men she had sex with
Before she was married to her husband
I understand why
Scotty, Jackson, Richard, and I got sauced
But Castillo
Why would she have gone after you?

[Brandon]
Oh well, uh...
Okay, remember fifteen minutes ago
When I was bragging about
Getting laid in the office
But I didn't want to tell you
Who the girl was?

[Mike]
Oh my God
Brandon, did you get sloppy seconds
Off of Audrey
While we were dating?

[Brandon]
No
I went third
Saverio got seconds

[Mike]
Oh my God
I cannot believe you guys
That is so fucked up
I ca--
Wait, hold on
Saverio how come you didn't get
Drizzled in porn syrup?

[Saverio]
I did
I just wiped it off
Because I didn't want you guys
To see my face covered in pee-pee goo
It wasn't hard to do
I don't know why you guys
Made a whole fucking scene out of it

[Mike]
Oh, you pricks
I'm gonna kick your ass--
Saved by the bell, huh?
Hello?
What?
A naked man has been
Running around in a mask at night
Between fifth and seventh street?

[Saverio]
Well
Looks like we've got another case to crack
Tune in next week, ladies and gentlemen
As we chase down The Sixth Street Streaker
On the next episode of--

161,Wait For A Minute,"Wait for a minute

Monday I wake up with disgust in my head
Could not forgive myself another moment spent in the bed
Monday the mirror always disappoints
I pinch my skin until I see the joints

Today I'm feeling like I live on the ledge
Any moment I just know I'm gonna fall off the edge
They say, ""hang on""
I promised them I will but I don't know for how long

Wait for a minute
(How, how how how?)
Wait for a minute
(How, how how how?)
Wait for a minute
(How, how how how?)
Wait for a minute
(How, how how how?)
Wait

Why do I spend the soul of my day
Looking for any way to waste away?
The pain is in the empty time
Just twiddling my thumbs and hoping for the words to rise

Today I couldn't stand to be all alone
And sick of hearing my voice on the telephone
A thousand roads to injury
Most of them so smooth
It doesn't feel they are hurting me

Wait for a minute
(How, how how how?)
Wait for a minute
(How, how how how?)
Wait for a minute
(How, how how how?)
Wait for a minute
(How, how how how?)

Oh, I'll still try to leave the high of violence behind
I'll wait for relief but the illness is my mind
Why should I wait?
I'm already too late
Why should I wait?

Not knowing what the future will bring
Is always wrecking my day
I guess I'll drown my fear and seal my fate
A haze of cravings
Easier to do it then it is to try sit here and wait
Easier to do it then it is to try sit here and wait

Wait for a minute

Wait for a minute
(How, how how how?)
Wait for a minute

And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
""You ain't bringin' Drake along?""
You know that I'm workin', I'll be there soon as I make it home

Sex, Love, Pain, baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til a nigga hit the jackpot, I'm saying

I hope you believe in us, the way I believe in us, you don't see

She’s popping right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, ""Oh, good lord, she had them long tanned legs""
Couldn't help myself, so I walked up and said

[Chorus]
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowing stop signs through the middle

In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

We were falling in love in the sweet heart of summer

When that summer sun fell to its knees
I looked at her and she looked at me
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night
Because it felt so right, her and I, man, we felt so right

I put it in park and grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl, you sure got the beat in my chest bumping

Hear the sirens, hear the circus so profound

The slightest bit of light and I can see you clear

[Chorus 1]
Oh, had to take your hand, and feel your breath
For fear this someday will be over
I pull you close, so much to lose
Knowing that nothing lasts forever
I didn’t care, before you were here
I danced in laughter, with the ever after
But all things change, let this remain

[Verse 2]
Hear the sirens covering distance in the night
The sound echoing closer, will they come for me next time?
For every choice, mistake I made it's not my plan
To send you in the arms of another man
And if you choose to stay, I’ll wait, I’ll understand

[Chorus 2]
Oh, it’s a fragile thing, this life we lead
If I think too much, I can get over-
Whelmed by the grace, by which we live our lives
With death over our shoulders
Want you to know, that should I go
I always loved you, held you high above too
I studied your face, the fear goes away

You got my heart bump-bumping
When I'm pulling up into your drive
Let's hit it 90 to nothin'
Couple kids running into the night

[Chorus]
Ready, set, let's roll
Ready, set, let's ride
Get your little fine ass on the step, shimmy up inside
Just slide, girl, by my side, girl
Yeah, we can run this town, I can rock your world
We can roll 'em down, fog 'em up, cruise around, get stuck
Pedal to the metal 'til the sun comes up
I made a deal with the man on the moon
He's gonna put in some overtime, we've got all night
Ready, set, let's roll
Ready, set, let's ride
Ready, set, let's roll
Ready, set, let's ride
Get your little fine ass on the step, shimmy up on inside

[Verse 3]
Hope I make it home
You'll be thinking of it
I got the whole city on my side, tonight, tonight
Watch us rock it out
Watch us leave the ground
After the show is done
You can take me to yours
But my lungs so muddy
I love the way it tastes
Drink it till I'm ugly baby
Fuck me while I'm faded
Feel that through my denims
Baby girl, I gotcha
I'm only 21 so I do it when I wanna
Gone from the codeine, 'methazine, lean
Got me feelin' kinda weak
And it's kinda hard to breathe
But you're turning 23, so I'll fuck you if you need
In your birthday suit
I'ma give you what you fiend, oh
But I ain't taking off my black boots
I'm fallin'
Cause I'm numb from the neck down
I'm sorry
You won't know that I can't feel it
I can win a fuckin' Oscar
By the way I fuckin' hid it
And you'll never fuckin' know
I'll never fuckin' show it
Except when I be wheezy from another cup of potion
Dirty Sprite toastin'
Fast life, fuck slow
Low life for life

182,Walking On Air,"[Verse 1: Rittz]
Here I come, fresh off tour, I bet I piss off more
Motherfuckers that thought I quit and I was just done for
But they was misinformed, 'cause I would just get warm
I'm back again to crack a thicker pack of sense in sword
I slid my tip in these pussies I'm 'bout to stick in the rest of it
Started raping the rap game; I was sick of molestin' it
Give me Crown and some Pepsi, a zanny bar and Mescaline
Have an Adderall dissolvin' on my tongue like a peppermint, shit...
What you still on the fence? You still not convinced?
I'm next, what you feel like I'm too real for the trend?
Don't resent me when you see me with the tints on the Benz
You gotta sit on the bench, you smellin' sin and some scents, you jealous?
I ain't stoppin' 'til I'm hot as Adele is and you can try to derail us
We change the jealousy just try to compel us
We relish any Clintel, this a mafia, wanna challenge us?
We'll put you in the ground with ya elders

[Hook: Rittz]
I feel like this is gonna be my year
Tension in the room when I appear
Other rappers they just don't compare
I think I got 'em scared, they hear me and it's clear
That I'm killin' it and
Feelin' like I'm walkin' on air (air!)
Feelin' like I'm walkin' on air (air!)
Feelin' like I'm walkin' on air (air!)

[Verse 2: Rittz]
I wear my Algierz tee, future famous is on
And for the hired I'm up in the Super 8, 'til it's super late
To an 8-ball, ain't chasin' but do it straight
Find about a lot of rappers duplicate what I do but can't
You should take notes, in the booth it's cake; it's nothin'
Study me and watch as I illuminate
Cockroaches, I got no choice, I gotta fumigate
Accumulatin' dollars daily, how much money you done made-
Off rappin'? They got the nerve to call me ugly, I'm offended
I'm a pimp and I could probably fuck ya girlfriend now dog
Poke her like a cattle prod, fuck her standin' up
Inside the bathroom got her grippin' on the towel bar, mouth wide
Do it for the money shot, what the fuck is up with guys?
Writin' comments below my pictures and shit
On Facebook, need to leave that to the bitches and chicks
And see 'cause why you busy dissin' me I been gettin' rich

[Hook: Rittz]
I feel like this is gonna be my year

[Verse 3: Rittz]
He drink a ginger ale, Jim Beam and Canada Dry, damn it if I
Ain't considered number one and I'mma lease this in a revive
Benign or somethin', 'cause I been runnin'
Circles around a rapper soundin' like it's amateur night
Screamin' like Janet and Mike on the mic, I'm champion-like
I'm probably in ya city at the Hampton Inn high
'Dirty Diana' who I met at the show and she blowin' me
While I'm fumin' and actin' camera shy
And I been rappin' from Atlanta to Chi-town
To Boulder, Colorado from Seattle down to Albuquerque
Where they found me lurkin' with a ounce of purple
With some Diamond Turf Nikes and a Falcons jersey
Down in Bourbon Street drinkin', showin' out, ya heard me?
Throwing beads at bitches, dirty rice, and Étouffée
We takin' over smellin' roses, it's a fresh bouqet

183,Same Love,"[Piano Intro]

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay
‘Cause I could draw, my uncle was, and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, ""Ben, you've loved girls since before Pre-K!""
Trippin', yeah I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like, ""Yeah, I'm good at little league.""
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition
Playing God, aw nah, here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And ""God loves all his children"" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
""Man, that's gay"" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
""Gay"" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on and be yourself
When I was at church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same, but that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal, damn right I support it

[Trombone Interlude]

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
We press play, don't press pause: progress, march on!
With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law
Kids are walking 'round the hallway
Plagued by a pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us, we have to change us
Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up!

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

I need your love

[Drop]
I need your love

[Verse 1: Ellie Goulding]
I take a deep breath every time I pass your door
I know you're there but I can't see you anymore
And that's the reason you're in the dark
I've been a stranger ever since we fell apart
And I feel so helpless here
Watch my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again

Now I'm dreaming, will ever find you now?
I walk in circles but I'll never figure out
What I mean to you, do I belong?
I try to fight this, but I know I'm not that strong
And I feel so helpless here
Watch my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again

I've always been one of them boys
Rolling around in jacked up toys
Making noise on small town Friday nights
Red light running, good time chasing
Guess I've earned this reputation
Probably never shake it but that's alright

[Chorus]
I've got a rough side, a wild side
At least a country mile wide
A fighting side after a few
If they want to see my sweet side
My soft side, my best side
I just point at you
Yea, point at you

[Verse 2]
Girl I ain't sure just what it is
That's got me all tore up like this
Your kiss done melted down this heart of stone
I still like to get a little crazy
But something about your loving baby
It breaks me down and makes me want to haul ass home

[Chorus]
I've got a rough side, a wild side
At least a country mile wide
A fighting side after a few
If they want to see my sweet side
My soft side, my best side
I just point at you
Point at you, yea

[Verse 3]
Oh girl I wouldn't blame ya if you tried to change me
Lord knows I'm hard to hold
But I guess you kinda like all of my sides
And I ain't letting you go
Cause my best side is holding me close
Point at you, yeah

[Verse 1]
Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl I always stay down, get down, never lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now, so much on my plate now
People I believed in they don't even show they face now
What they got to say now? Nothin' they can say now
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now? What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothin' was the same

[Chorus]
I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know
I just been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know

[Verse 2]
And I hate that you don't think I belong to ya
Just too busy runnin' shit to run home to ya
You know that paper my passion
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened
I can't help it, I can't help it, I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
And now you hate me, stop pretendin', stop that frontin', I can't take it
Girl don't treat me like a stranger, girl you know I seen you naked
Girl you know that I remember, don't be a pretender
Gettin' high at the condo, that's when it all comes together
You know I stay reminiscing and make-up sex is tradition
But you been missin' girl and you might feel like nothin' was the same

I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low

Uh, this the life for me
My momma told me this was right for me
I got 'em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me
I should have Spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rappin' different
This the shit I wanna go out to
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin'
Naked women swimmin', that's just how I'm livin'
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feelin'
A nigga fillin' up arenas, who the fuck could see us?
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up

Y'all niggas party too much, man, I just chill and record

188,From Time,"[Intro: Jhené Aiko]
What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it
You've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that, 'cause...

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

[Outro: Baka]
""Been Baka aka Not Nice from time, G
Been a East Side ting

So I don't know what's wrong with these
Little wasteman out here eh?
Y'all need to know yourself.""",Drake,2013,"[89, 67]",2
189,Little Bit Of Everything,"With his back against the San Francisco traffic
On the bridge's side that faces towards the jail
Setting out to join a demographic
He hoists his first leg up over the rail

A phone call's made, police cars show up quickly
The sergeant slams his passenger door
He says, ""Hey son why don't you talk through this with me?
Just tell me what you're doing it for""

""Oh, it's a little bit of everything
It's the mountains, it's the fog
It's the news at six o'clock
It's the death of my first dog""

""It's the angels up above me
It's the song that they don't sing
It's a little bit of everything""

There's an older man who stands in a buffet line
He is smiling and he's holding out his plate
And the further he looks back into his timeline
That hard road always led him to today

Making up for when his bright future had left him
Making up for the fact his only son is gone
And letting everything out once, his server asks him
""Have you figured out yet, what it is you want?""

I want a little bit of everything
The biscuits and the beans
Whatever helps me to forget about
The things that brought me to my knees

So pile on those mashed potatoes
And an extra chicken wing
I'm having a little bit of everything

Somewhere a pretty girl is writing invitations
To a wedding she has scheduled for the fall
Her man says, ""Baby, can I make an observation?
You don't seem to be having any fun at all.""

She said, ""You just worry about your groomsmen and your shirt-size. And rest assured that this is making me feel good.""
I think that love is so much easier than you realize
If you can give yourself to someone, then you should

Cause it's a little bit of everything
The way you joke, the way you ache
It is getting up before you
So I can watch you as you wake

So on the day in late September
It's not some stupid little ring
I'm getting a little bit of everything

Oh, it's a little bit of everything
It's the matador and the bull
It's the suggested daily dosage
It's the red moon when it's full

All these psychics and these doctors
They're all right and they're all wrong
It's like trying to make out every word
When they should simply hum along

It's not some message written in the dark
Or some truth that no one's seen
It's a little bit of everything",Dawes,2013,"[92, 82, 63, 47, 45, 40, 35, 33, 43, 45, 51, 55, 62, 62, 62, 68, 68, 79, 91, 94]",20

You know I'm a real OG and baby I ain't from the T.O.
I'm messing with the clique though, meet me on the sixth floor
No you ain't a model, you should let me take some pics though
Windows down, speakers loud, look down at my sneakers now
Got so many features, tell the creatures just to beat it now
Fifty for the necklace, look down at my set list

192,Bruises,"[Verse 1]
Counting days, counting days
Since my love up and got lost on me
And every breath that I've been taking
Since you left feels like a waste on me
I've been holding on to hope
That you'll come back when you can find some peace
'Cause every word that I've heard spoken
Since you left feels like a hollow street

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind
Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side

[Chorus]
There must be something in the water
'Cause every day, it's getting colder
And if only I could hold you
You'd keep my head from going under

[Verse 2]
Maybe I, maybe I'm just being blinded
By the brighter side
Of what we had because it's over
Well, there must be something in the tide

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind
Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side

Even though I'm nothing to you now

There must be something in the water

193,"Gone, Gone, Gone","[Verse 1]
When life leaves you high and dry
I'll be at your door tonight
If you need help, if you need help
I'll shut down the city lights
I'll lie, cheat, I'll beg and bribe

To make you well, to make you well

[Verse 2]
When enemies are at your door
I'll carry you away from war
If you need help, if you need help
Your hope dangling by a string
I'll share in your suffering
To make you well, to make you well

Give me reasons to believe
That you would do the same for me

And I will do it for you, for you
Baby, I'm not moving on
I'll love you long after you're gone
For you, for you
You will never sleep alone
I'll love you long after you're gone
And long after you're gone, gone, gone

When you fall like a statue
I'm gon' be there to catch you
Put you on your feet, you on your feet
And if your well is empty
Not a thing will prevent me
Tell me what you need, what do you need

I surrender honestly
You've always done the same for me

You're my backbone
You're my cornerstone
You're my crutch when my legs stop moving

Like a drum, baby, don't stop beating
Like a drum, baby, don't stop beating
Like a drum my heart never stops beating

[Chorus]
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure (yeah)
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure

[Bridge]
How you feel about comin' home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fuckin' out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?

[Verse]
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas looking like ""Preach""
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me, I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize
He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory, things change in that life
And this life started lacking synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Yeah, paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man

[Chorus]
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours

195,Too Much,"[Chorus: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
(Oohh, don't think about..)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Done sayin' I'm done playin'
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out more
I've been stackin' up like I'm fundraising
Most people in my position get complacent
Wanna come places with star girls, and they end  up on them front pages
I'm quiet with it, I just ride with it
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's putting shots up
And like a potluck, you need to come with it
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summertime, I keep it 100
Met a lot of girls in my times there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like ""Is Bun coming?
Fuck that, is anyone comin' 'fore I show up there and there's no one there?""
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, ""Take a deep breath, you're too worried about being the best out""

[Chorus: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
(Oohh, don't think about..)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family going backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'
I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's actin' like, ""Oh, well, this is life, I guess,"" Nah, fuck that shit
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, telling herself
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round, started treating me like I'm ""him"" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now
Shit got me feeling pinned down, pick the pen up or put the pen down
I'm writing to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down

[Chorus: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
Ohhh, don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through, ohhh
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you, ohhh,ohhh
(Don't do that..)

[Outro: Sampha]
Don't give up, on your hopes
And you tell me somethin's gone wrong
Wholehearted, wholehearted, you care, you care
Cause I'm such a dreamer, a believer in a sense
Well if it's all a dream
Then I'm on fire, feels like, I'm on fire
Tell me when I'm lyin', tell me when I'm tryin'",Drake,2013,[64],1

Yours... You're still the one that I adore
Ain't much out there to have feelings for

Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is? Yours

It ain't a secret, baby, everybody saw us
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? It's yours
Next time we fuck, I don't wanna fuck, I wanna make love
Next time we talk, I don't wanna just talk, I wanna trust
Next time I stand tall, I wanna be standin' for you
And next time I spend I want it all to be for you
Peakin', I'm peakin'
Wake up with me this weekend, we can, oh

Just let that shit sink in, ha!
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Who could get the pussy quicker these days
Still straight with the weed and the liquor these days
Cause the new drugs got the kids trippin' these days
Bunch of journalists been searchin' for a story
My ex-girl been searchin' for a ""sorry""
Couple bitches tryna have me on the Maury
Like nigga it's yours, you should be supportin'
But where you been at? On tour, gettin' money
Y'all don't even really check for me
You ain't even hit me when that nigga had threats for me, girl
You don't love me, you just say that shit to get to me, girl
Cause you got the Batphone and my workline, you should call
When the last time you did somethin' for the first time?
You done done it all
I swear to God, niggas talk more than bitches these days
Got you thinkin' that I'm different these days
Broken telephone for every single conversation
By the time it gets to you, shit switches these days
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's... it's always gonna be yours

[Intro]
Yeah, alright, yeah

[Verse 1]
Comin' off the last record, I'm gettin' 20 million off the record
Just to off these records, nigga that's a record
I'm livin' like I'm out here on my last adventure
Past the present when you have to mention
This is nothin' for the radio, but they'll still play it though
Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go
Heavy airplay all day with no chorus
We keep it thorough, nigga, rap like this for all of my borough niggas
I reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga
I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn't reach, nigga
Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga
I could go a hour on this beat, nigga
I'm just as famous as my mentor
But that's still the boss, don't get sent for
Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for
Cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more
Hot temper, scary outcome
Here's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one
That always let they mouth run
Bench players talkin' like starters, I hate it
Started from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it
Yeah, Tom Ford Tuscan Leather smellin' like a brick
Degenerates, but even Ellen love our shit
Rich enough that I don't have to tell 'em that I'm rich
Self explanatory, you just here to spread the story, wassup

[Verse 2]
Sittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV
Young rebel, Young Money nothin' you could tell me
Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me
I'll compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family
Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin'
I dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it
I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it
Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin'
On a mission tryna shift the culture
Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit
Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin'
All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments
Fuck what you think, I'm too busy, that's why you leave a message
Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive
That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure
Like ayy, B I got your CD, you get an E for effort
I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless
Owl chains like credentials, you know you see the necklace
My life's a completed checklist
I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now
Just give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now
That's real

[Verse 3]
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento
I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo
The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk
Off everything my pen wrote we went from Bundy to Winslow
This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo
I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna (Talk to 'em)
The fresh prince, just had dinner with Tatyana, no lie
All these 90's fantasies on my mind
The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time
I might come through without security to check if you're fine
That's just me on my solo like fuck it, like YOLO
Wanted to tell you, ""Accept yourself""
You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself
And if you end up needin' some extra help, then I could help
You know, back on your feet and shit
Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though?
Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorsese
And I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me, now real nigga wassup
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?

[Outro]
If there's hell below. I'll see you when you get there. Are you enjoyin' yourselves? If we may we'd just like to close off with somethin' a bit inspirational. Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all are having the same fears, shedding similar tears, and of course dying in so many years. It don't mean that we can't have a good life. So we'd like to just maybe close out with something, some food for thought, for all of us",Drake,2013,[81],1
198,Young And Beautiful,"[Verse 1]
I've seen the world, done it all
Had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel Air now
Hot summer nights, mid-July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child

[Chorus]
Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

[Verse 2]
I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now
Channeling angels in the new age now

And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul

[Chorus]
Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will

Dear Lord, when I get to heaven

Yeah
We had the type of nights where mornin' comes too soon
And nothin' was the same

Watch me, goin' out of the way, when I shoulda went home
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own
I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib
Should drive by right where you live and pick you up on the way
We ain't spoke in so long, prolly put me in the past
I can still get you wet, and I can still make you laugh

Yeah, last night I brought DOA to the studio
They already had a stage and a booty pole
It's supposed to be a lot of hard workin' goin' on
But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin' goin' on?
Someone put a order in for a chicken (for a chicken)
Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen (need the kitchen)
Yeah, they know I got the hookup, they just wait on me to cook up
Baby, I heat up the stove, you do the dishes, ya know?
Rap game, crack game, ain't that different, ya know?
Last album had it boomin' somethin' vicious, ya know?
And ya know I need ya back in my life
Girl, ya know ya got that, know ya got that thing that I like
Girl, you got that thing for real
When I was on a mission to make it
Who used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement?
Who else got all the things you need at 4am when it's late?
I always pour you up a drink and let you burn somethin'

Come through, come through, come through, come through

Worst...
Mothafucka never loved us
Fucka never loved us
You ain't know, now you know now
Still at it, scrub J's with a toothbrush
Shit...
Niggas still playing my old shit
But your shit is like the police askin' us questions
Nigga, we don't know shit
Flexin'...
Nigga, I'm just flexin'
Nigga never loved us
Do it look like we stressin'?
Look at you, look at you and look at you
Aww, I'm glad that they chose us
'Cause man it's a mission, tryna fight to the finish
Just to see am I finished

[Chorus]
On my worst behavior, no? They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
Remember? Mothafucka!

[Verse 2]
Hold up, hold my phone
Mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us
Now you want to roll one
Mothafucka never loved us
So everywhere we go now, full cup
Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man
Mothafucka, I done growed up
You know me? You know me?
I'm liable to do anything
When it comes to that you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
Bitch, you better have my money
When I come for that shit like O.D.B

[Verse 3]
Who's hot, who not? Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores?
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop, whose jewels got rocks
Who else making rap albums, doing numbers like it's pop?
Same old pimp, Drake, you know ain't nothin' changed
With these funny style niggas, we done put on in the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
Then it's back to L.A., open the mail, starin' at the check
Enough to make you throw up, man, it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playin' with her left
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stuntin', I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the borderline
Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead I'm comin' back on my worst behavior

[Outro]
Remember? Remember? Mothafucka, remember?
Hold up, hold my phone, they used to never want to hear us

This Armani, this Givenchy, I parachute you
I'm so fly I jumped out the air wearing Gucci (Tell 'em!)
I'm raw, talking California Rolls
Smoking California weed with California hoes (Truu!)
Sending flicks to my partners in the state pen

202,American Girl,"[Verse 1]
Well, she was an American girl
Raised on promises
She couldn't help thinkin' that there
Was a little more to life somewhere else
After all, it was a great big world
With lots of places to run to
And if she had to die tryin', she
Had one little promise she was gonna keep

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy, baby
Make it last all night (Make it last all night)
She was an American girl

[Verse 2]
Well, it was kinda cold that night
She stood alone on her balcony (Ooh)
Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by
Out on 441 like waves crashin' on the beach
And for one desperate moment there
He crept back in her memory
God, it's so painful when something that is so close
Is still so far out of reach

Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy, baby

You so damn important
Everything you do shows me you know it
Behind it all you are the motive
Don’t tell you enough, but baby I'll show it, show it
He say the king where he come from
Take a young queen just to know one
So, baby, I’ma drive it like it’s stolen
I’ma fix it like it’s broken
We could catch a flight out to London
Go to the mall, spend a lump sum
They could try to catch up to us
But they’re too busy making assumptions

She said, ""I ain’t even make my bed up""
""Watch your step, you gon’ wake my mama and dad up""
Pssh, girl, didn’t I tell you at the damn club?
We gon’ wake your neighbors
Turn your block club to my fan club
And that happen so fast
Damn, I'm glad I strapped up
Ask her when she finish, if she came
She said I lapped ya twice
Run it back for the dub, rematch
Flip the crib when we fuck, RE/MAX
It get hot than a mug, glass cup
You can ask her if I fuck, she gassed, huh
I gotta keep it a secret, I keep a key in my lower pocket
Inside a register below the lower octave
Dirty laundry in my closet, they be strung out on the street
Left to dry with drawers, sheets and no deposit
But I don’t gotta worry, put my hand on your mouth
Put my hands in your mouth, girl
We got plans at my house, you know the way up

Never met someone who spoke my language
Never met a nigga done with playin’

Show me your soul and I'll mold it

Gotta be to fuck with the coldest

At this little hot mess
Mister, you'll understand
I'm doing my best

[Chorus]
And I know I'm all over the road

It's hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
When she's all over me, I'm all outta control
All over the road

[Verse 3]
Don't wanna get no ticket
Don't wanna cause no wreck
It's hard to concentrate with her pretty little lips on my neck
I say ""Girl take it easy""
She laughs, says ""It'll be fine""
How am I supposed to keep it between the lines?

[Chorus]
Yeah, I know I'm all over the road
I can't help but go
A little bit of left, a little bit of right

Radio playing gets her going
I'm trying to get her home as fast as I can go

Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I get it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Uh, the best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
No matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple double, no assists
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Arguing with my older bitch, acting like I owe her shit
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, ""This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now""
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it ""Malibooyah""
Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit 'em with a new style?
Know that motherfucker well: ""What you gon' do now?""
Whatever I wanna do, gosh! It's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So mommy, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ahh, put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship
I'm living in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass

Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles, I
Kill the block, I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles' heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and blood-suckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Milling about, spilling they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up

Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't

That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really, really I don't give a F-U-C-K
""Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki 'cause she's fake""
""She on a diet,"" but my pockets eating cheesecake
And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's Child's Play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, 'Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Am should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Aaaah, I'm a motherfucking monster!

[Outro: Bon Iver & Charlie Wilson]
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide (decide)
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home

And I'll, I'll let God decide (no)
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home (headed home)

Saklasam, saklasam en derine

Alın içimdeki vicdanı, yakın içimdeki insanı
Bi' canım var o da simsiyah
Silahımda yol al isyanım
Kendime nefretim hep
Sersefil ev virane zindanım
Evim bi' zemheri yer, sesleriyse cinayet ihbarı
Sirenler Buca’da fon
Bu taraf çok sıkıntı bol ama sıkıntı yok
Sıkıştır ot elinde koş gecikme
Polisin belinde Colt
Benimle koş; bi' kere düşün, empati kur, yerimde ol
Yenilmez olarak doğardık o zaman eninde sonunda seninle
En işlek sokağım ol, konayım odalarına koy okşayıp o kalbine
Aşık olurum kafesime kovamı koy kafi
Denetim altında tutulan kafesin içinden kurtulamaz
Maziye tutunmak uçurumda bi' dal sigara sebebi cariye
Yukarım yerin en dibine bi' karış, mezarım derin
Ben içinde firarım
Acilen ört beni kazıp kazıp göm yine
Görürsem yüzüne tükürüce'm kaderin, kefenim kafiye
Yazıp yazıp sözleri sonunda sonunu düşünüce'm
Güzel anım da var acımayın kanıksarım
Yaşarım dışında kalıpların
Taşarım kabımdan takarım çıtayı çatıya şaşırır yakınlarım
Yarından ümidi kesenlerin bugüne çalışır akılları
Kesiyorum kanıksarım bunu da, yatışır acılarım
Yakışır yaşıma saçın akı
Canımın adı da kaşımdadır
Aşılamak ona Rap'i sorun
Alışır başına kalır adım
Yarışın içinde çamura bulanır
Aşırı biçimde tarumar burası
Gelmesin rezil olur can acır kahırdan adım adım
Sıyırtır akıl alır kıskanılır hasım hısım karışır aşım
Tutmasın değmesin eline mikrofon
Bi balon elinde koca dünya durmasın
Neyi seviyo'san git o ol
Babacım yaşamın yapı taşı yaşamak
Yaşayıp tanı Şah’ı

You tell all the boys no
Makes you feel good, yeah
I know you're out of my league
But that won't scare me away, oh no
You've carried on so long
You couldn't stop if you tried it
You've built your wall so high
That no one could climb it
But I'm gonna try

[Chorus: Labrinth]
Would you let me see beneath your beautiful
Would you let me see beneath your perfect
Take it off now girl, take it off now girl
I wanna see inside
Would you let me see beneath your beautiful tonight

[Verse 2: Emeli Sandé]
You let all the girls go
Makes you feel good, don't it?
Behind your Broadway show
I heard a boy say, ""Please don't hurt me""
You've carried on so long
You couldn't stop if you tried it
You've built your wall so high
That no one could climb it
But I'm gonna try

[Chorus: Emeli Sandé]
Would you let me see beneath your beautiful
Would you let me see beneath your perfect
Take it off now boy, take it off now, boy
I wanna see inside
Would you let me see beneath your beautiful tonight?
Ohhh, tonight
See beneath, see beneath
I...tonight
I...

[Bridge: Labrinth and Emeli Sandé]
I'm gonna climb on top your ivory tower
I'll hold your hand and then we'll jump right out
We'll be falling, falling

I just wanna know

I got a problem, with these bitches
Trigger finger, keep itchin'
Well I'll pull it, I'll do it, yeah

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz & All]
Yeah! Hang up on a bitch, call it crucified
Time to go to work, no suit and tie
Bumpin' Makaveli, I be trappin' out the telly
My nigga did a dime and he back already
Got that sack already, man we got them racks already
As far as your girl, I hit it from the back already
I tried to get a tan, but I'm black already
Your pockets on a diet, my pockets fat already
Three niggas with me, me myself and I
God don't like ugly, you should testify
My T-shirt come from Bergdorf
I make so much on a verse I take the third off
Bird call, swerve off
Bust a nut on her, tell her that's a load off
Shorty ass soft, like a Nerf ball
If you don't like what I'm doing, nigga, fuck y'all

Drank in my cup holder, hope this shit don't spill
Pull up in the new edition and that's word to Johnny Gill
How I come up with this shit and all these verses that I kill?
I have no imagination, everything I do for real
Bitch I'm camouflaged, down put your camera phone down
If she got a ass and the girl a fan, it's going down
I'ma fuck you like I've been waiting a century for it
Give the pussy up and I'll trade you the memory for it
In the bedroom forever, that's what her roommate will tell you
Man I just hear this shit and think about what Tunechi will tell you
He might call up Patricia, she 'bout to call up Melissa
Tell 'em come to the cribbo and do them both, double dribble
I'm colder than a hospital, she love the dick that I give her
Hit her from the front, back, side, twist her like cigarillos
I put the gun to the pillow, I don't want blood on my clothes
Gotta keep that Trukfit fresh, shoutout to all of my hoes
(Tunechi) That's just how my OG would sum it up
I been working all winter just to fuck the summer up
It's just me and 2 Chainz, but the chain's never tucked though
If you don't like what I'm doing, nigga fuck y'all

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz, Lil Wayne & All]
Well, if you know like I know, that pussy pop like pyro
And she know I'm a pothead, that pussy like a pothole
I’m colder than a snotnose, man all these hoes is my hoes
And if she bougie, fuck her once then leave her hanging, dry clothes
I just built a cemetery, niggas dying to get in
Niggas lying, they pretend, don’t cross that line, it's paper thin
High as a star, make a wish, I’m a shark, I ate the fish
I got no heart, I hate that bitch
You hate that bitch? Well I hate that bitch
Will jump a nigga like a chessboard
Do a drive by while you riding on your skateboard, uh
They ain't even know it
Have Drake sing a song just to get her pussy wet
Then I take her to the crib, man, fuck that bitch right on the step
Put it in and take it back out, then I back out
Hair-Hair Weave Killer known to snatch the fucking track out
Put me in the ga-game coach, I'm the antidote
Pull up, kick, throw and take the money, and the dope
True, 2 Chainz, I'm on a plane, and a boat
I am so cold, I need a cover, and a coat
Kick it at the mall, call it football
If you don't like what I'm doing, nigga, fuck y'all

[Outro: Quartet]
(Y'all ready? 1, 2, 3)
Right now it's me time

Bitch please don't call my phone (don't call my phone)
Said I wanna be left alone (be left alone)
Please, please don't stop by my home (stop by my home)
No, no cause I feel it's just a matter of time

I'm 'bout to leave this world behind, yeah, yeah

220,Popular Song,"[Verse 1: Both]
You were the popular one, the popular chick
It is what it is, now I'm popular-ish
Standing on the field with your pretty pompoms
Now you're working at the movies selling popular corn
I could have been a mess but I never went wrong
Cause I’m puttin' down my story in a popular song
Ahh, I said I'm putting down my story in a popular song

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
My problem, I never was a model
I never was a scholar, but you were always popular
You were singing all the songs I don't know
Now you're in the front row, cause my song is popular

[Chorus: MIKA]
Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular
And all that you have to do, is be true to you
That’s all you ever need to know

[Post-Chorus: Both]
So catch up, cause you got an awful long way to go
So catch up, cause you got an awful long way to go

[Verse 2: Both]
Always on the lookout for someone to hate
Pickin' on me like a dinner plate
You hid during classes and in between 'em
Dunk me in the toilets now it's you that cleans them
You tried to make me feel bad with the things you do
It ain't so funny when the joke's on you
Ooh, the joke's on you
Got everyone laughing, got everyone clapping, askin'
How come you look so cool?
Cause that’s the only thing that I learned at school, boy
Uh huh, I said that’s the only thing that I learned at school

[Pre-Chorus: Both]

I never was a scholar, but you were always popular

It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were

That’s all you ever need to know

[Post-Chorus: Both]
So catch up, cause you got an awful long way to go
So catch up, cause you got an awful long way to go

[Bridge: Ariana Grande]
That’s all you ever need to know
You're only ever who you were
That’s all you ever need to know
You're only ever who you were
That’s all you ever need to know

Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car

222,Reflektor,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Trapped in a prison, in a prism of light
Alone in the darkness, darkness of white
We fell in love, alone on a stage
In the reflective age

[Pre-Chorus - Régine Chassagne]
Entre la nuit, la nuit et l’aurore
Entre le royaume des vivants et des morts
If this is heaven
I don't know what it’s for
If I can’t find you there
I don't care

[Chorus]
I thought I found a way to enter
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
I thought I found the connector
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)

[Verse 2]
Now, the signals we send, are deflected again
We're so connected, but are we even friends?
We fell in love when I was nineteen
And now we're staring at a screen

[Pre-Chorus - Variation - Régine Chassagne]
Entre la nuit, la nuit et l’aurore
Entre le royaume des vivants et des morts
If this is heaven
I need something more
Just a place to be alone
Cause you're my home

[Chorus]
I thought I found a way to enter
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
I thought I found the connector
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)

It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)

It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)

It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)

[Bridge 1]
It’s just a reflection of a reflection
Of a reflection of a reflection
But I see you on the other side? (Just a Reflektor)
We all got things to hide (Just a Reflektor)
It’s just a reflection of a reflection
Of a reflection of a reflection
But I see you on the other side (Just a Reflektor)
We all got things to hide (Just a Reflektor)
All right, let's go back

[Verse 3]
Our song it skips, on little silver discs
Our love is plastic, we'll break it to bits
I want to break free, but will they break me
Down, down, down?
Don't mess around

[Chorus]
I thought I found a way to enter
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
I thought I found the connector

It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)
It’s just a Reflektor (It's just a Reflektor)

[Bridge 2: Win Butler & David Bowie]
Thought you were praying to the resurrector
Turns out it was just a Reflektor (It’s just a Reflektor)
Thought you were praying to the resurrector
Turns out it was just a Reflektor (It’s just a Reflektor)
Thought you were praying to the resurrector
Turns out it was just a Reflektor (It’s just a Reflektor)

It’s a Reflektor
It’s just a Reflektor

Can't stop, because I love it
Hate the way I love you
All day, all night
Maybe I'm addicted for life, no lie

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm not too shy to show I love you

You got the kind of love that I want, let me get that

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got 20 dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up
This is fucking awesome

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Now
Walk into the club like, ""What up? I got a big cock""
Nah, I'm just pumped, I bought some shit from a thrift shop
Ice on the fringe is so damn frosty
The people like, ""Damn, that's a cold ass honkey""
Rollin' in hella deep, headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink 'cept my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standin' next to me
Probably should've washed this, smells like R. Kelly sheets
Piss...
But shit, it was 99 cents!
Fuck it, coppin' it, washin' it, 'bout to go and get some compliments
Passin' up on those moccasins someone else has been walkin' in
Bummy and grungy, fuck it man, I am stunting and flossin'
And saving my money and I'm hella happy; that’s a bargain, bitch
I'ma take your grandpa's style, I'ma take your grandpa's style
No, for real, ask your grandpa, can I have his hand-me-downs? (Thank you!)
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie brown leather jacket that I found diggin'
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a knee board
Hello, hello, my ace man, my mellow
John Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no
I could take some Pro Wings, make 'em cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like, ""Ah, he got the Velcros""

What you know about rockin' a wolf on your noggin?
What you knowin' about wearin' a fur fox skin?
I'm diggin', I'm diggin'
I'm searchin' right through that luggage
One man's trash, that's another man's come up
Thank your granddad for donatin' that plaid button-
up shirt 'cause right now, I'm up in hurr stuntin'
I'm at the Goodwill, you can find me in the bins
I'm not, I'm not stuck on searchin' in that section (Mens)
Your grammy, your auntie, your mama, your mammy
I'll take those flannel zebra jammies
Second hand and I'll rock that, motherfucker
The built-in onesie with the socks on the motherfucker
I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker
They be like, ""Oh, that Gucci? That's hella tight""
I'm like, ""Yo, that's 50 dollars for a T-shirt""
Limited edition, let's do some simple addition
50 dollars for a T-shirt, that's just some ignorant bitch shit
I call that getting-swindled-and-pimped shit
I call that getting tricked by business
That shirt's hella dough
And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't
Peep game, come take a look through my telescope
Tryna get girls from a brand?
Man, you hella won't! Man, you hella won't!

226,The Other Side,"[Verse 1: P.T. Barnum]
Right here, right now
I put the offer out
I don't want to chase you down
I know you see it
You run with me
And I can cut you free
Out of the drudgery and walls you keep in
So trade that typical for something colorful
And if it's crazy, live a little crazy
You can play it sensible, a king of conventional
Or you can risk it all and see

[Chorus: P.T. Barnum]
Don't you wanna get away from the same old part you gotta play
'Cause I got what you need
So come with me and take the ride
It'll take you to the other side
'Cause you can do like you do
Or you can do like me
Stay in the cage, or you'll finally take the key
Oh, damn! Suddenly you're free to fly
It'll take you to the other side

[Verse 2: Phillip Carlyle]
Okay, my friend, you want to cut me in
Well I hate to tell you, but it just won't happen
So thanks, but no
I think I'm good to go
'Cause I quite enjoy the life you say I'm trapped in
Now I admire you, and that whole show you do
You're onto something, really it's something
But I live among the swells, and we don't pick up peanut shells
I'll have to leave that up to you

[Chorus: Phillip Carlyle]
Don't you know that I'm okay with this uptown part I get to play
'Cause I got what I need and I don't want to take the ride
I don't need to see the other side
So go and do like you do
I'm good to do like me
Ain't in a cage, so I don't need to take the key
Oh, damn! Can't you see I'm doing fine
I don't need to see the other side

[Verse 3: P.T. Barnum]
Now is this really how you like to spend your days?
Whiskey and misery, and parties and plays

[Phillip Carlyle]
If I were mixed up with you, I'd be the talk of the town
Disgraced and disowned, another one of the clowns

[P.T. Barnum]
But you would finally live a little, finally laugh a little
Just let me give you the freedom to dream and it'll
Wake you up and cure your aching
Take your walls and start 'em breaking
Now that's a deal that seems worth taking
But I guess I'll leave that up to you

[Bridge: Phillip Carlyle]
Well it's intriguing, but to go would cost me greatly
So what percentage of the show would I be taking?

[P.T. Barnum]
Fair enough, you'd want a piece of all the action
I'd give you seven, we could shake and make it happen

[Phillip Carlyle]
I wasn't born this morning, 18 would be just fine

Why not just go ahead and ask for nickels on the dime

Don't you wanna get away to a whole new part you're gonna play
'Cause I got what you need, so come with me and take the ride
To the other side
So if you do like I do
So if you do like me
Forget the cage, 'cause we know how to make the key
Oh, damn! Suddenly we're free to fly
We're going to the other side
So if you do like I do

I'd like to blame it all on life
Maybe we just weren't right
But that's a lie, that's a lie

And we can deny it as much as we want
But in time our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is, everyone knows

Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each others arms
And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough

There'd be no such thing as goodbye

230,Goodbye Town,"[Verse 1]
Right there's the high school where we met
We'd sneak out back for a couple of kisses and a cigarette
And that parking lot was our first date
And her momma slammed the door
When I dropped her off too late

[Pre-Chorus 1]
She's gone
Chasing that highway wind
She's gone
She ain't coming back again

Gotta find a way to finally get out
Out of this goodbye town

And they'd ring the bells of that little church

But I still feel her on my skin
She's gone
But she ain't coming back again

231,When I See This Bar,"[Verse 1]
Well I see the souls of so many friends
And I see us all back here again
With sandy floors and ceiling fans
A Rastafarian one-man band with songs
That fills my memories like a tip jar
Yeah, that's what I see
When I see this bar

[Verse 2]
I see tourists at Christmas time
And I taste beers with a hint of lime
I feel lonely because it's not the same
Different faces and different names
Living like pirates out among the stars
Yeah, that's what I see
When I see this bar

[Chorus]
Pieces of our past slowly slip away
But time just stands still when I walk in this place

[Verse 3]
And I see a kid coming into his own
And a man learning to move on
Somehow trying to find his way
A dreamer betting on blind faith
Chasing that sun and following his heart
Yeah, that's what I see
When I see this bar

[Chorus]
Pieces of our past slowly slip away
But time just stands still when I walk in this place

[Verse 4]
A few have moved on back to Maine
Jacksonville and Key Biscayne
Some are still living the dream
Stuck in still life it seems
No matter where they've been
Or where they are
Yeah, I see them here
When I see this bar
When I see this bar

[Verse 5]
I wonder where we go from here
(That's what I see when I see this bar)
Life isn't over but it's always near
(That's what I see when I see this bar)
I think about all the good times that we had
(That's what I see when I see this bar)
It makes me happy and it makes me sad
(That's what I see when I see this bar)
How could we be so close, now so far apart
(That's what I see when I see this bar)
That's what I feel, that's what I see
Yeah we were living like pirates and want to be stars

Yawk! Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window – check yourself!
Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, ""Ayy, y'all—duck!""
That's what Momma said when we was eatin' that free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce!
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
Make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
M.A.A.d. city

Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad'
Sleepin' in the living room of my momma's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired, 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons but still will never know my life

I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah that's cool
Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules
But yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately, shit
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip, yeah

Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Perceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
Probably go to the projects, I

Got me open all night, hey

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Okay, back when I was sleeping in my mama crib
Or even back when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Paying seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well-spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?
Had a thing for ya, even wrote the song ""Dreams"" for ya
‘Cause I had dreams for ya, thoughts of a ring for ya
Childish shit, you know child and shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home, I'm grown now, and the city's my throne now, huh
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got Kriss Kross'd: totally crossed out
‘Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks crying ‘cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spill on me, while I feel on you, I'm sayin'—

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya

And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are

And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Well, this has got to be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever and
Fuck it, I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wife'ing in the club, man, my homies gon' disown a nigga
Like, ""Give me twenty dollars, dollars!""
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college?
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you're alone now
Can't help but feeling like I dropped the ball, cliché
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now, typically I kick game like East Bay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling: ""Please play!""
For Pete's sake, homie, pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through with forever, but—

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya, yeah

And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are

It don’t matter what plans I got, I can break ‘em
Yeah, I can turn this thing around at the next red light
And I don’t mind telling all the guys “I can’t meet ‘em”
Hell, we can all go raise some hell any other night
Girl, I don’t care, oh, I just gotta see what you’re wearing
Your hair, is it pulled up or falling down?
Oh, I just have to see it now

[Chorus]
If you wanna call me, call me, call me
You don’t have to worry ‘bout it, baby
You can wake me up in the dead of the night
Wreck my plans, baby that’s alright
This is a drop everything kind of thing
Swing on by I will pour you a drink
The door’s unlocked. I’ll leave on the lights
Baby, you can crash my party anytime

[Verse 2]
Ain’t a spot downtown that’s rockin’ the way that you rock me
Ain’t a bar that can make me buzz the way that you do
I could be on the front row of the best show
And look down and see your face on my phone
And I’m gone so long, hang on. I’ll meet you in a minute or two

[Chorus]
If you wanna call me, call me, call me
You don’t have to worry ‘bout it, baby
You can wake me up in the dead of the night

I'm booking myself a one-way flight
I gotta see the color in your eyes
And telling myself I'm gonna be alright
Without you, baby, is a waste of time

[Verse 2]
Yeah, our first date, girl, the seasons changed
It got washed away in a summer rain
You can't undo a fall like this
'Cause love don't know what distance is
Yeah, I know it's crazy

[Chorus]
But I don't want ""good"" and I don't want ""good enough""
I want ""can't sleep, can't breathe without your love""
Front porch and one more kiss
It doesn't make sense to anybody else
Who cares if you're all I think about?
I've searched the world and I know now
It ain't right if you ain't lost your mind
Yeah, I don't want easy, I want crazy
Are you with me, baby? Let's be crazy
Yeah

[Verse 3]
Well, I wanna be scared, don't wanna know why
Wanna feel good, don't have to be right
The world makes all kinds of rules for love
I say you gotta let it do what it does
I don't want just another hug and a kiss goodnight
Catching up calls and a date sometimes
I love that we're rebels and we still believe
We're the kind of crazy people wish that they could be, yeah
Uh, I know we're crazy, yeah

[Chorus]
But I don't want ""good"" and I don't want ""good enough""
I want ""can't sleep, can't breathe without your love""

I fucked up the rap game and you ain't even know it
I just fucked what's her name and you ain't even know it (you ain't even know it)
She got a *beep* tattoo and you ain't even know it (real talk)
We about to form a little group and you ain't even know it, let's get it
Stuck in a rock and a hard place
Eminem, Pac and where God stay
Timberlands pop that jaw bone
Now bitch nigga, tell me how that tar taste
And even Tarzan can get swung on
I never hung out with the loud mouth
You got a foul mouth
And that dead body gon' smell foul when it fouls out
She filed my nails in the Bahamas
We found ourselves in the Bahamas
She found God, meditation, and peace
I found myself without a condom
You know everybody having them babies
It's a beautiful thing it ain't crazy
If a rapper monogamous, you know what the problem is?
Too many bitches got rabies
And I hate a ho-hoppin' woman
Stank pussy-poppin' woman
You fuckin' fool don't know about you
But my dick need 17 years on it
Anything after that is just a bonus
And I been in the lab with my opponents
And since Sway done swayed that list
He got a flatscreen the next morning
Tell 'em I need my credit when it's due
Tell 'em I need my lettuce when it's new
Tell 'em I got a fetish for fine fabric, Franklins and saying, ""Fuck you""
Tell 'em it's TDE 'til I'm DDT'd in that grave
And Top Dawg is proof
'til my nigga Whoo Kid get free, ain't shit comin' for free
I'm 'bout to rape you niggas 'til you recoup
(Dizzle)

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
It's a groovy nigga, that's all day, Backwood hold three grams
Got a six-shooter, that revolver spinning, shell stuck inside, but won't jam
This hoody here about two stacks, hell yeah that bitch could gon' go ham
Molly in her drink, but she asked me to and oh yeah I got this on cam
Gangsta nigga, no trap beats, bet I still sound like that new shit
Originality in my blueprint, still Figg side, Figueroa pimp
Her big ass where my palm hit, pull my dick out, she gon' balm it
Swag surfin' all through the world, slide through the sea on a comet
O-X-Y for these morons, that be that new shit I'm pushin'
Raise off of them pockets, bring more of them coffins
These niggas ain't popping, tell them, old niggas, to move on
Aw damn I done said it, all them can beheaded

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
She ain't single but she solo, you ain't even know it
Unsigned with sold out shows, you ain't even know it
My lips black but they ain’t chapped, she ain’t even know that
Let’s have sex, she said, ""Yes"", you know she ain’t ""no"" that
Seed of life on my chest, my head next to her breast
My mind all in the clouds, just bought an ounce of the best
No talking when I’m off that loud
I came quick so she pissed
You know I’m good for another round
But it’s hard when everybody on your dick
Know real niggas that’s crips, I know real niggas that’s bloods
Know real niggas that’s thugging like you ain’t know what’s up
Got codeine in my cup, got a couple checks that need cashing
And you could take that to the bank, what’s life without a balance?
You ain't even know it, nigga, I be everywhere you ain’t even going
I thought it was snowing, but I’m just the coldest nigga out here flowin'
Sick of all that bullshit y’all been promoting, but (Soul!)
Carson in the motherfucking house
Del Amo, watch your motherfucking mouth
I took the game by storm, just to X men out
I'm crazy out my mind, I put my life on the line
The tortoise only makes progress when his neck sticks out
Just a little token of gold if you ain't know it, though

[Verse 4: Jay Rock]
Respect, I get the utmost
I'm so dope I'm a walking kilo
36 Os, you don't even know I'm gettin' cheese like Cheetos
You mad that we BMFing, bitch-ass niggas steady PMSing
I never show my hands, can't know my plans
Gotta keep them guessing
Rock, I was off the scene
Now a nigga back like a four and a half
Shooting up the set like Spielberg
See the big picture when them hammers flash
I don't post a lot on Instagram
That's the quickest way they'll get you, man
Leave that shit for the bitches man
Alphabet boys, they'll get your ass
IRS, they was on a nigga
Cashed them out, now I'm scot-free
Got my passport in my JanSport, now I'm overseas
You don't even know it
Rock been killin' this shit, no gloves, no mask on me
Just 100 thousand cash on me
Back then, I was doing bad, homie
All my bitches bad now
My old hoes try to keep tabs on me
Safe to say I'm the man now
Fuck ass nigga just stand down
'Fore the shots go up and it's man down
Hands down, still popping
No prescription, I'm flexing
Suplex a pussy, I've been off the edge
Too late to push me, nigga I ain't fell off
Used to move Frosted Flakes like Kellogg's
Pull up to the bank, count paper like tellers
Top Dawg, Money Gang, bitch, we've been on
Clothesline the beat, nigga, John Cena
Been having stripes, can't walk in my Adidas

I don't really vibe with alot of these niggas
I ain't really into giving more than one chance girl
I already tried with alot of these niggas, fuck that
That team don't know real, what's that? That can't be from here
That can't be what they believing is the best shit of the year
That's that fake shit, that's that fake shit
That's that top row of veneers
Just when they getting impatient is when I make a world premiere
Uh, damn, word?
Award shows coming? Make sure you spell that shit right
Make sure to give me all the credit I deserve
Make sure the good stuff still in that Sprite
They watch us make the shit into the song
You ain't livin' that boy, stop stealin' that life
Anything can happen when I do see ya
Guess it all depend how I feel on that night

Break it down, spread it out, nigga, roll up!
And let's see what they about, call them hoes up

Sip slow but I'm drivin' all in the fast lane
Get the fuck up out my way, man, move bitch!

Down the middle, that's the best way to split it

Tell your girlfriend's friends, bring friends too
What you drinkin'? I got it, I pour it all up
Southside, my partners they throw it all up
I don't want a menage, so bitch, let go
I'm tryin'a get three women, play Connect 4
Congratulations, you made it into the Top 5
Your mouth helped me push the Bentley into Mach 5
She got me speedin' in the red zone
Or as Luda like to call it, it's the Head Zone
Heads up! A bread winner, the bread's up
So make a peace sign baby, put your legs up

Do you like a lil' scratch, lil' bite?

Sitting in taxi cabs, where daddy roaming the streets
Seven hallelujahs, my sutana was clean
On everything I wear it, all the America's tees
This whole system most prolific in the DMV
Listen when you get the keys it's seldom, you don’t get the beef
Make a nigga wanna get the piece to get to peace
You gon' need more than Wikipedia to get to me
PG to Mo County bet they all know about me
Every hood, every 'burb, I got superb balance
From the city that made me love you forever for it
Hope you celebrate every moment forever ignore it
You made me what I am, you made me what I'm not
They gon' love you a little different when you at the top

Yeah, my affinty grows as the city gets cold
As you reaching your goals, you gon' meet you some foes
Having dinner with Leonsis I'm dreaming to own
But for now me and my homies see the bottom floor
I'm trying to redefine the culture, and renovate the soul
Women in town, but I'm manifestating every goal
I see potential in John, talk to him once a week
Media targets in our city it ain't ever sweet
I lost a lot of friends and they ain't even dead
When I was on my way up, why you ain't see the stairs?
Lord father if I opted to follow them
My heart would tear from my dreams let me know that you here
And it's rare when I'm anywhere with too many heads
Niggas jealous and never tell it until they stare
How could you blame us envy?
We do the same thing for a living
Know the same niggas, but they all commend me
Champagne I'ma spill it until we all fill up
Maybe it stopped me from giving a fuck about opinions
And probably not, but I'm temporarily out of fizzucks
So tell the post to leave propaganda to politicians

Gotta get it in the ground 'fore the rain come down
To get paid, to get the girl
And your four-wheel drive
A country boy can survive

[Chorus: Blake Shelton]
Yeah, the boys 'round here
Drinking that ice cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls, talkin' 'bout trucks
Runnin' them red dirt roads out, kicking up dust
The boys 'round here
Sendin' up a prayer to the man upstairs
Backwoods legit, don't take no shit
Chew tobacco, chew tobacco, chew tobacco, spit
Aww, heck
Red-red-red-red-red-red-redneck

[Verse 2: Blake Shelton]
Well the boys 'round here, they're keeping it country
Ain't a damn one know how to do the dougie
(You don't do the dougie?)
Nah, not in Kentucky
But these girls 'round here, yep, they still love me
Yea, the girls 'round here, they all deserve a whistle
Shakin' that sugar, sweet as Dixie crystal
They like that y'all and southern drawl
And just can't help it cause they just keep fallin'

[Chorus: Blake Shelton]
Yeah, the boys 'round here
Drinking that ice cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls, talkin' 'bout trucks

252,When I Was Your Man,"[Verse 1]
Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize

[Chorus]
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

[Verse 2]
My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made (oh)
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize

[Chorus]
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

[Bridge]
Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

[Chorus]
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man

This is gospel, for the fallen ones
Locked away in permanent slumber
Assembling their philosophies
From pieces of broken memories

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
This is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart

But they haven't seen the best of us yet

If you love me let me go (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
If you love me let me go (Oh-oh-o-oh-oh-oh)

256,We Own The Night,"[Intro: Tilian]
Forget my jealousy
You swallowed the demons on your own
There's nothing left for me
I keep thinking back to when you said, ""We own the night!""

[Chorus: Jon Mess]
Stomp that feeling, your puke is a mutant
Can’t think of who did this, well, I grew stupid
Say accidents happen, it’s admirable acting
Flicking the back of your ear with my finger
Separate is the way though, no, second is the place though
Just fake it through the day and the night is your god
See you in battle, your boat is my paddle
Your life is my business, your plaque on my wall

[Verse 1: Tilian]
Let your hair down, have one more round, drink 'til you believe it
Sloppy kisses, dirty wishes, baby, this is living
Roller coaster, up and down in random motion
Oh, come in closer, ditch your problems, better days are coming

Get up off the wall, come on, get down, get down
Give into the moment and live now, live now
Get up off the wall, come on, get down, get down
Give into the moment, feel it now

[Pre-Chorus: Tilian]
I have the heart of a coward
Here in my arms is exactly where I want you
We own the night

[Chorus: Jon Mess]
Stomp that feeling, your puke is a mutant
Can’t think of who did this, well, I grew stupid
Say accidents happen, it’s admirable acting
Flicking the back of your ear with my finger
Separate is the way though, no, second is the place though
Just fake it through the day and the night is your god
See you in battle, your boat is my paddle
Your life is my business, your plaque on my wall
You’ll forget I’m wrong

[Verse 2: Tilian]
Call your phone and open up my fate
'Cause I know you're so connected
I need poison, mitigate my pain
Feel my toes go golden up in flames
Give me false hope in my veins
Tranquilize and modify my brain

[Bridge: Tilian, Jon Mess]
Where did I go wrong?
There's nothing I can do, the thrill is gone
(Wake up, you're dead, you're gonna go)
So I play these nervous songs
Pretend that I’m not barely hanging on
(Wake up, you're dead, you're gonna go)

And medicate, medicate
Medicate me all night long
Medicate, medicate
Medicate me all night long
(You're dead, you're dead, you're dead now)

257,Your Side Of The Bed,"[Verse 1:  Karen]
On your side of the bed, there's a picture of our wedding day
A clock that don't work and the bible that your daddy gave
It's on the window side, where the moon creeps in at night
Staring at the ceiling, lying here all alone
I said a prayer for you then I said one of my own
But you don't reach for me, when you lie down quietly

[Chorus]
Tell me how, how'd you get so far away?
All we have left are the memories of the love we made
Are you sleeping with your own regret?
On your side of the bed

[Verse 2: Jimi]
On your side of the bed there's a burned out candle flame
A letter I started but I didn't know what to say
No I couldn't write it down, so I'll try to say it now

[Chorus]
Tell me how, how'd you get so far away?
All we have left are the memories of the love we made
Are you sleeping with your own regret?
On your side of the bed

[Verse 3]
Aren't you even going to make a sound?
Your side of the bed
Turn the other way when I turn the lights down
Your side of the bed
Are you lonely? Like I'm lonely?

[Chorus x2]
How, how'd you get so far away?
All we have left are the memories of the love we made
Are you sleeping with your own regret?
On your side of the bed

[Outro]
On your side of the bed
Are you still awake, on your side of the bed",Little Big Town,2013,[96],1

'Round the outside, 'round the outside
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside

Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
‘Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that! Cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, ‘cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits—fuck you, Debbie!

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch!""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass (*smack*)​​
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass—you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat with
Anybody who's talking ""this shit, that shit""
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You 36-year-old baldheaded fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me

Monogamy or whatever you call it
I'm startin' to think it ain't for er'ybody
Most of us is rushin' into it anyways
You know what I'm sayin'?
You ain't rushin' for love, and I ain't up here to judge
Let's neglect the what if's
And make it do what it does, let's get it

[Hook: Tiara Thomas]
Is it bad that I never made love?
No, I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to ya
I can't promise that I'll be good to ya
'Cause I had some issues
I won't commit, no, not havin' it
But at least I can admit
That I'll be bad, no, to you (to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed
But I'll be bad to you
Bad that I never made love
No, I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck

[Verse 1: Wale]
Bad girls ain't no good, and the good girls ain't no fun
And the hood girls want a smart nigga
College girls all want a thug
So it seems that we fiend what we don't need
Got a thing for a queen who know when to leave
I ain't bout to judge you, don't judge me
You ain't gotta really sing about your rap sheet
'Cause I heard you (bad, nooo)
In the literal sense I mean that
Rough sex, sayin' I love ya
But to kiss them is sayin' you mean that (bad, nooo)
I know, I just be callin' her mean-ass
Oh the irony, got the bomb indeed
But the problem is probably a deep past
Still I'm feelin' of somethin' I need bad
Thinkin' if I get her, I get her to need this
I don't need emotions to open your deep sea
I conceive an ocean by goin' between legs
Beg? Nope—bed, floor, dope; go for it, couch now
Slow motion around, put it down
Lord knows she was gone ‘fore the morn', hold up

Yeah, I'll be good in bed
But I'll be bad to you
(Yeah, let me tell you 'bout her, look!)

[Verse 2: Wale]
She hurt feelings, she break hearts
She stay quiet, she play smart
She take pride in goin' out
And gettin' hollered at and sayin' nah
She no saint, but she don't pose
She don't wear make-up by the boatload
Ridin' through lake shore with the nose up
She don't really date much, but it slows her up
She got haters, but we all do
Heard you're winter-time cold, shawty, fall through
Baby, look at they approach, how they court you
All those minds games, nevermind, 'cause they all lose
(Bad, nooo) In the physical sense I mean that
I ain't tryna kiss up, suck up, feed gas
I ain't like them nigga you suckin' your teeth at, nope
Play big, trust me I'll humble yo' mean-ass
Look, shawty is actually in prevent
'Cause the one in front of her is workin' with deep threat
Yep—bed, floor, couch, more
More, shower, Lord, perm, done
Love? Nah, called in the morn'
Cell number wasn't on, goddamn!

262,Hopeless Wanderer,"You heard my voice
I came out of the woods by choice
Shelter also gave their shade
But in the dark I have no name

So leave that click in my head
And I will remember the words that you said
Left a clouded mind and a heavy heart
But I was sure we could see a new start

[Hook]
So when your hope's on fire
But you know your desire
Don't hold a glass over the flame
Don't let your heart grow cold
I will call you by name
I will share your road

But hold me fast, hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
And hold me fast, hold me fast
'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer

I wrestled long with my youth
We tried so hard to live in the truth
But do not tell me all is fine
When I lose my head, I lose my spine

So leave that click in my head
And I won't remember the words that you said
You brought me out from the cold
Now, how I long, how I long to grow old

[Hook]
So when your hope's on fire
But you know your desire
Don't hold a glass over the flame

Somewhere another pretty vein just died (died)
I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see

And I'm a-hoping for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight

Running from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now

But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more

Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train

Walking to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
But he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I got to get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free

Keep your heart wide open
Disappear just like the tide
Let it roll on by

Let the music pull you in
You can jump right in
Oh, and lose yourself again

[Verse 1]
It’s like ’09 in your basement
And I’m in love with Nebby
And I still love her but it fell through because I wasn’t ready
And your back hurt and your neck hurt
And you smoking heavy
And I sit next to you and I lecture you
Because those are deadly
And then you ash it and we argue
About spending money on bullshit
And you tell me I’m just like my father
My one button, you push it
Now it's, ""Fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat!""
And I leave out and you call me, you tell me that you sorry
You love me and I love you
And your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep
But it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter
I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard
If you were healthy and it weren't so bad
Uh, maybe I should walk up the street
And try and get a job at the bank
Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks
We'll probably end up robbing the bank
Then Wayne calls up my phone
Conversation wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh it's my time, yeah, it's on
He's thinking of signing me, I come home
We make a mixtape with 17 songs
And almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your son—man, that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
I get to make good on my promise
It all worked out, girl, we shoulda known
Cause you deserve it

[Chorus]
Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When you're stressed out and you need something, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done

[Verse 2]
It's like '06 in your backyard
I'm in love with Jade
And I'm still in love, 'cause when it's that real
Is when it doesn't fade
And my father living in Memphis now, he can't come this way
Over some minor charges and child support
That just wasn't paid, damn
Boo-hoo, sad story—black American dad story
Know that I'm your sister's kid
But it still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn, your house felt like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you man this all-new, shit
Made the world I know bigger
Changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fighting going on at the crib
You would calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done acting
I'm more in touch with the music
You said, either way, I'll be a star, I could go so far
Talked to me, you got to me
Then you’d toss the keys and loan me your car
Yeah, just a young kid in a drop top
Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested
Just another kid that's going through life
So worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything, you said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that
They said no, we went back
Checks bounced but we bounced back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't know where
I'd really be without that, it worked out
Man, you deserve it

[Chorus]
Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When you're stressed out and you need something, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done

Hi Aubrey, I'm here sitting with my son having a little talk—and he knows how to get in touch with you now, to let you know how grateful I am for your help in keeping me in this—in this comfortable place.

276,Beat This Summer,"[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-ho

[Verse 1]
Like the Ferris wheel goes around and around
Well, the trouble with up is there's always a down
First I'm holding your hand and we're on the boardwalk
There's heaven right here on these streets and these docks

[Verse 2]
But the sun keeps settin', the days go fast
And the sand on the beach is like an hourglass
I can just feel it all slipping away
And babe I can already say that

[Chorus]
As long I live, whatever I do
As great as it is, you know what's a bummer
I ain't ever gonna beat this summer with you
Baby, it's true
The taste of your kiss is so bittersweet
I ain't gonna beat
No way I'm gonna beat this summer with you

[Verse 3]
Before you know it, it's all gonna stop
They'll be rolling up windows and puttin' up tops
Be a cold wind blowin' the leaves through the air
And you won't find a tan line anywhere

Baby, I know that it ain't over yet
So let's make the most of what we have left
But it's hard living for this moment we're in and
Knowing it's all gonna end

Yeah, looking at you, girl, standing there
Got your Wayfarers on and the sun in your hair
And just like the song in a seashell, you'll be stuck in my mind
Bouncing around in my head
And baby, I can tell

As long I live (as long as I live), whatever I do (whatever I do)
As great as it is, you know what's a bummer

Found another victim
But no one's going to find Miss Jackson

You put a sour little flavor in my mouth now
You move in circles hoping no one's gonna find out
But we're so lucky, kiss the ring and let them bow down
Looking for the time of your life (no one's gonna find out)

A face like Heaven, catching lightning in your nightgown
But back away from the water, babe, you might drown
The party isn't over tonight (in your nightgown)

Way down until the fire finally dies out
You've got them wrapped around your finger, watch them fall down
There's something beautiful and tragic in the fall out

Hey, where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Hey, out the back door, goddamn, but I love her anyway

Poor old Grandad
I laughed at all his words
I thought he was a bitter man
He spoke of women's ways
""They trap you, then they use you

When you want her lips, you get her cheek
Makes you wonder where you are

Come swallow the wine

You tell me that you love me, baby, say it again
Repeat it over and over until it's in my brain
Picked up the drugs so I let my brain go
Woulda fried yours too, but I'm selfish about my Percs, oh

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Shorty like a thousand dollar plate, fine china
Tell her that she beautiful every day, I remind her
Then I jump in her pussy like a lake, I'm a diver
And her last man was a pussy, had a vagina
I get lost in her eyes, like dust from the skies
It's her body or nobody, I refuse to compromise
So if she leaves, I'ma kill her, oh, she'll die
Did I say that out loud? I'm so crazy about mine

[Verse 2: Future]
I'm so crazy about mine (Wheezy outta here)
I'm goin' to Pluto with my girl (Oh, shorty)
I'm goin' to Jupiter with my girl (Don't call your exes)
I'm goin' to Mars with my girl (Don't call your exes)
I'm goin' to Saturn with my girl
Been feelin' like I'm runnin' out of space
You need to send your location, I can't think
I done fell in love twice but I gotta be lyin'
'Cause I'm livin' ten lives, I go crazy about mines (Ayy)

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Shorty like a thousand dollar plate, fine china
Tell her that she beautiful every day, I remind her

283,"Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe","[Produced by Sounwave]

[Chorus]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

[Verse 1]
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin' with you?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge

[Refrain]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this

[Chorus]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

[Verse 2]
I'm tryin' to keep it alive
And not compromise the feeling we love
You're tryin' to keep it deprived
And only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror
I know what you scared of
The feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name
I'll let the people know this is somethin' you can blame
On yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I'ma break out and then hide every lock

[Refrain]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'

[Outro]
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
You ain't heard the coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings
Now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music
I say bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

Niggas is cool with it 'til the canons pop
Now my hand on the Bible on the stand
Got your man in a jam again, got my hands in cuff
I'm like goddamn enough
I put down the cans and they ran amok
My hairpin pierce skin, ruptures spleens
Cracks ribs, go through cribs, and other things
No sympathy for the king, huh?
Niggas even talk about your baby crazy
Eventually the pendulum swings
Don't forget America this how you made me

You in the presence of a king
Scratch that, you in the presence of a God
Put in the belly of the beast
I escaped, a nigga never had a job
Scott Boras, you over baby

These niggas like rotary phones
It's a new day, hit up KD
Niggas always try to knock a nigga down
Knock me to my knees about a million times
Uncle said I'll never sell a million records
I sold a million records like a million times
These niggas shouldn't let me in
I ball so hard on ESPN
See my name come across on CNN
'bout 6 minutes, you gonna see it again
'bout 6 minutes, you gonna see me again

If Fear is your only God
Get y'all to fear me is my only job

Bulletproof glass, glass roof like the Pope
Bulletproof love, niggas down since the yolk
Bitch asked if I was God, fuck I'm supposed to say? No?
You already seen me turn a man to a G.O.A.T
You already know what I could do with the coke
Dropped it in the water, made it disappear
I made it reappear, I had that bitch on a rope
I make my roof get ghost, bottom grill, I make my tooth get gold
All the shit I did, I wasn't supposed to live, Hallelujah Hov
Wasn't for the 'caine wouldn't be able
Wasn't for the bread, probably be dead
Best friends become ya enemies, niggas' knives are double-edged

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Shit on me, these niggas tried to shit on me
I was left for dead, they tried to wipe me out of your history
Shit on me, these niggas tried to shit on me

Livin' at my momma's house, we'd argue every month

Workin' all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle callin' me, like, ""Where you at?
I gave you the keys, told you bring it right back”

Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah, I doubt it

But I used to tell em they were wrong

Will stay right by me in this song
I stood there counting every heartbeat
Thinking about the words to say
Tried not to understand that feeling
But would it ever go away?

Now those were the days
Before you had to go away
Now I'm dancing by myself
Out in the rain
Now it's getting rather cold
And I just wanted you to know
That if my dreams will ever be
Will you come dancing next to me?
Next to me
Next to me
Next to me

[Verse 2]
You told me we would be forever
But maybe we were just too young
I wonder if you still remember
When we were dancing in the sun

Now those were the days
Before you had to go away

Why I'm jealous of all them headlights headed south

Cause every time I look behind me I see her
I think I just realized how much I need her

So I’m turning back for Georgia
Stopping short of Tennessee
I can’t put my dreams before her
Man, I need her with me
Cause that girl’s in every song I sing

A couple fake visas 'cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love, fucking with them heart breakers
But he was gettin' money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things, ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to Sing Sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
Five year bid up north when they ratted
Anyway, I felt him, helped him, put him on lock, seat belt him
Took him out to Belgium, welcome
Bitches this pretty, that's seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I'm Momma Dee in that order, I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk, but I like it when he be sober
That's top of the toppa, I never fuck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers

I tell her, ""Bitch, you crazy, fuck wrong with you?""
And excuse my French, but I'm a long kisser
And then she try to tell me I'm the only one that's hittin'
And I say, ""What about them niggas?"" She say, ""What about them niggas?""
You right, what you doing tonight?
Put on something tight, don't judge me, I get life
She love me like a brother, but fuck me like a husband
Pussy like a oven, too hot to put my tongue in
All I had to do is rub it, the genie out the bottle
Pussy so wet, I'ma need goggles
She tell me that's it's mine, I tell her stop lying
Mine and who else? She say worry 'bout yourself

And the same ones that I ride with
Be the same ones that I die with
Put it all out on the line with
If you looking for me you can find Wiz
In the new car or in the crown with
My new broad, that's a fine chick
And the wonder squad, I'm down with
Ain't no way around it
What you say, tell me what you say
Working hard, reppin' for my dogs, do this every day
Takin' off, looking out for all, makin' sure we ball
Like the mob, all you do is call
Catch you if you fall, Young Khalifa

I never feared death or dying
I only fear never trying
I am whatever I am
Only God can judge me now

One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes
I'ma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
(I ride or die for love)
This the biggest day of my life
We got big guns, been graduated from knives
It's the day in the life and I'm ready to ride
Got the spirit, I'm feelin' like a killer inside
Financial outbreak, I'm free but I ain't out yet
Ridin with the plug so I'm close to the outlet
At the red light, rims sittin' offset
I look better on your girl than her outfit

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Stuck to the plan, always think that we would stand up, never ran
We the fam and loyalty never change up
Been down since day one, look at where we came from
Jumpin out on anybody who try to say some one thing about it
Got a problem, I got the same one
Money rolls, we fold
Plently clubs we closed
Follow the same code
Never turn our backs, our cars don't even lose control

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes
I'ma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous

This moment, we own it

Don't know if I'm a hero
But I’m the one to end this war

All these flashes within my mind
I need to find the key that’s in my past
All this power I feel inside
It's time to make my stand

[Chorus]
I’m not sending no apologies
I'm not holding back any longer
You wanna keep me down,I'd like to see you try
(hey hey hey)
You're not getting what you want from me
What didn’t kill me made me stronger
You wanna hold me down, I'd like to see you try
Cause I was born to fly

All these flashes within my mind
All this power I feel inside

Paper doll, come try it on
Step out of that black chiffon
Here’s a dress of gold and blue
Sure was fun being good to you

[Verse 2]
This one we made just for fall
And winter runs a bit too small
This mint green is new for Spring
My love didn't cost a thing

[Chorus]
You’re like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what they’re running from
Was it just too far to fall
For a little paper doll

Fold a scarf, Moroccan red
Tie your hair behind your head
Strap into some heels that hurt
You shoulda' kept my undershirt

Was it just too far to fall

Make yourself some angel wings

Someone’s going to paint you another sky

People smile and tell me I'm the lucky one
And we've only just begun
Think I'm gonna have a son
He will be like she and me, as free as a dove
Conceived in love
Sun is gonna shine above

And even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you, honey
And everything will bring a chain of love
And in the morning, when I rise
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything is gonna be alright

Seems as though, a month ago, I was Beta-Chi
Never got high
Oh, I was a sorry guy

312,Downtown,"[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I went to the moped store, said ""Fuck it""
And salesman's like ""What up, what's your budget?""
And I'm like ""Honestly, I don't know nothing about mopeds""
He said ""I got the one for you, follow me""
Ooh, it's too real
Chromed out mirror, I don't need a windshield
Banana seat, a canopy on two wheels
Eight hundred cash, that's a hell of a deal
I'm headed...

[Verse 2: Grandmaster Caz, Kool Moe Dee & Melle Mel]
Downtown, cruising through the alley
Tip-toeing in the street like ballet
Pulled up, moped to the valet
White walls on the wheels like mayonnaise
Dope, my crew is ill, and all we need is two good wheels
Got gas in the tank, cash in the bank
And a bad little mama with her ass in my face
I'ma lick that, stick that, break her off, Kit-Kat
Snuck her in backstage, you don't need a wristband
Dope

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
Killing the game, 'bout to catch a body
Passed the Harley, Dukie on the Ducati
Timbaland, Khaled, Scott Storch, Birdman
Goddamn, man, everybody got Bugattis
But I'ma keep it hella 1987
Head into the dealership and drop a stack and cop a Kawasaki
I'm stunting on everybody, hella raw, pass the Wasabi
I'm so low that my scrotum's almost dragging up on the concrete
My seat is leather, alright, I'm lying, it's pleather
But girl, we could still ride together, oh
You don't need an Uber, you don't need a cab
Fuck a bus pass, you got a moped, man
She got 1988 Mariah Carey hair
Very rare, mom jeans on her derriere
Throwing up the West Side as we tear in the air
Stop by Pike Place, throwing fish to a player

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Nally]
Downtown, downtown (Downtown)
Downtown, downtown (Downtown)
She has her arms around your waist
With a balance that will keep her safe (Downtown)

[Verse 4: Grandmaster Caz, Kool Moe Dee & Melle Mel]
Dope
Cut the bullshit, get off my mullet
Stone washed, so raw, moped like a bullet, oh, yee-ow
You can't catch me, a po-po can't reprimand me
I'm in a B-Boy stance, I'm not dancing
I got your girl on the back going tandem
Cause I'm too damn quick, I'm too damn slick
Whole downtown yelling out ""Who that is?""

[Verse 5: Macklemore]
It's me, the M, the A-C, the K
Sounding like a French pimp from back in the day
I take her to Pend Oreille and I water skate
I mean, water ski, ollie, ollie, oxen free
I'm perusing down Fourth and they watching me
I do a headstand, the eagle lands on my seat
Well hello, but baby, the kickstand ain't free
Now do you or do you not wanna ride with me?
I got one girl, I got two wheels
She a big girl, but ain't a big deal
I like a big girl, I like 'em sassy
Going down the backstreet listening to Blackstreet
Running around the whole town
Neighbors yelling at me like, ""You need to slow down""
""Going thirty-eight, Dan, chill the fuck out
Mow your damn lawn and sit the hell down""
If I only had one helmet, I would give it to you, give it to you
Cruising down Broadway, girl, what a wonderful view, wonderful view
There's layers to this shit, player, tiramisu, tiramisu
Let my coat-tail drag but I ain't tearing my suit, tearing my suit

I'm sadder than most of y'all with the money and the freedom, nigga
What is money really worth if it ain't love?

314,Maybe It Was Memphis,"Looking at you through a misty moonlight
Katydid sing like a symphony
Porch swing swaying like a Tennessee lullaby
Melody blowing through the willow tree

What was I s'posed to do
Standing there looking at you?
Lonely boy far from home...

Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you, maybe it was me
But it sure felt right

Read about you in a Faulkner novel
Met you once in a Williams' play
Heard about you in a country love song
Summer night beauty took my breath away

What was I s'posed to do
Standing there looking at you?
Lonely boy far from home

Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you, maybe it was me
But it sure felt right

Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you, maybe it was me
But it sure felt right

Every night now since I been back home
I lie awake drifting in my memory
Think about you on your mama's front porch swing
Talking that way, so soft to me

What was I s'posed to do
Standing there looking at you?
Lonely boy far from home

Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
Maybe it was you, maybe it was me
But it sure felt right",Pam Tillis,2013,"[93, 92]",2

320,Like Jesus Does,"[Verse 1]
I'm a long-gone Waylon song on vinyl
I'm a back row sinner at a tent revival
But she believes in me like she believes her Bible
And loves me like Jesus does

[Verse 2]
I'm a lead foot leaning on a souped-up Chevy
I'm a good old boy, drinking whiskey and rye on the levee
But she carries me when my sins make me heavy
And loves me like Jesus does

[Chorus]
All the crazy in my dreams
Both my broken wings
Every single piece of everything I am
Yeah, she knows the man I ain't
She forgives me when I can't
The devil, man, no, he don't stand a chance
Cause she loves me like Jesus does

[Verse 3]
I always thought she'd give up on me one day
Wash her hands of me, leave me staring down some runway
But I thank God each night, and twice on Sunday
That she loves me like Jesus does

[Chorus]

Word got around to the barflies and the baptists

I can hear her now saying she ain’t gonna have it
Don’t matter how you feel, it only matters how you look

Leave it to me to be holding the matches
When the fire trucks show up and there’s nobody else to blame

Can’t get revenge and keep a spotless reputation
Sometimes revenge's just a choice you gotta make

Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face

Danger in the fabric of this thing I made
I probably shouldn't show you, but it's way too late
My heart is with you hiding, but my mind's not made
Now they know it like we both knew for some time I'd say
They're smirking at fresh blood, they're circling above
But this is not enough, yeah, this is not what you thought
No, no, we are not just graffiti on a passing train
I got back what I once bought back
In that slot, I won't need to replace
This culture is a poacher of overexposure, not today
Don't feed me to the vultures, I am a vulture who feeds on pain
Sleep in a well-lit room, don't let the shadow through
And sever all I knew, yeah, sever all
I thought I could depend on my weekends
On the freezing ground that I'm sleeping on
Please, keep me from, please keep me down from the ledges
Better test it, wooden wedges under doorways
Keep your wooden wedges under doors

Wait, habits here too, you’re the worst, your structure compensates
But compensation feels a lot like rising up to dominate by track two

332,Love And War,"[Verse 1]
Somebody said every day was gon' be sunny skies
Only Marvin Gaye and lingerie
I guess somebody lied
We started discussin', then to fightin', then don't touch me please
Then it's let's stop the madness, just come lay with me
And truth be told, I'm wavin' my flag before it goes bad, yeah yeah

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Cause we made it this far on for better or worse
I wanna feel it even if it hurts
If I gotta cry to get to the other side
Let's go cause we're gon' survive, oh

[Chorus]
We stay on the front lines
Yeah, but we're still here after the bomb drops
We go so hard we lose control
The fire starts then we explode
When the smoke clears we dry our tears
Only in love and war

[Verse 2]
Sometimes you're my general
You quarterback all these plays
Sometimes you're my enemy and I'm throwin' grenades
We'll just be chillin' and laughin', I'm layin' on your chest
I don't know what I did cause things just went left
But here we go back down that road
That's just the way that it goes

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Cause we made it this far on for better or worse
I wanna feel it even if it hurts
If I gotta cry to get to the other side
As long as you're there, I'll survive, oh

[Chorus]
We stay on the front lines
Yeah, but we're still here after the bomb drops
We go so hard we lose control
The fire starts then we explode
When the smoke clears we dry our tears
Only in love and war

As long as we make up after every fight when it's over
You know I'm comin' home, right there, where I belong
I'm takin' all this over

333,Pirate Flag,"[Verse 1]
Well I come from a little bitty, homegrown small town
Smoky Mountains, nice place to hang around
Moonshine, that's where they make it
Put it in a jug, makes you want to get naked
But I jumped on a greyhound bus one night
And took it all the way to the end of the line
Stepped out in the sun, when my feet hit the sand
What a long strange trip

[Chorus]
I spent my whole life running around
Still let the wind kind of blow me around
Well I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole another world
A pirate flag and an island girl

[Verse 2]
Well my friends back home think I've gone and lost my mind
Take a sip of rum and you really would know why
Jolly Roger flying on the picnic table
Blender in the kitchen, willing and able
Don't know what makes you say what the hell
But when the salt air catches a hold of that sail
Something about it makes her just want to dance
And she loves to dance

[Chorus]
I spent my whole life running around
Still let the wind kind of blow me around
Well I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole another world
A pirate flag and an island girl

[Bridge]
Well I remember back home beneath the big old moon
Tucked back in the woods, yeah life was good
But here we are in a local bar and drinking shooting stars

[Outro]
I might spend my whole life running around
Still let the wind kind of blow me around
Well I dropped a note in a bottle

Lil' bitch, my section is important

Weed so loud it's distorted
Got champagne and we pourin' it
She poppin' it and she snortin' it
My iPhone recordin' it, if I want it, I can afford it
Bitch I'm Young Khalifa, fillin' my lungs with reefer
Somewhere in the clouds, gotta press up to see us
I gotta whip so fast that I caught a ticket speedin'
And my bitch so bad that I'm never ever cheatin'
I might pull up in some shit that you've never ever seen
And if I said how much I made, then you won't even believe it

335,Can't Shake You,"[Verse 1]
I still change the station
Every time they play that song
Can't drive past your house
So I take the long way home
Your black leather jacket
Still hangin' in my closet
I wish that I could give it away
Oh, even though you're gone, somehow you stay

[Chorus]
And every other time a love said goodbye
I just shake it off, shake it off
Pour another drink so I don't feel a thing
I just shake it off, break it off
Erased all your numbers, blocked all your calls
Tried another lover, built up my walls
Told myself it's over, don't know what else I can do
I can't shake you

[Verse 2]
I didn't wanna be here
But my friends all love this bar
I don't wanna see you
But I'm wondering where you are
And why am I still keepin'
The shirt you used to sleep in
It's been sittin' there for over a year
Oh even though you left me you're still here

[Chorus]
And every other time a love said goodbye
I just shake it off, shake it off
Pour another drink so I don't feel a thing

You're a troublemaker, you're a troublemaker
You ain't nothing but a troublemaker, girl

Told her if I die, I'ma die young
Every day I've been gettin' fucked up

If I overdose, bae, are you gon' drop with me?

Went to Hollywood thrills from the street life
Took too many drugs, now I don't feel right

Tell me 'bout the good old days
Sometimes it feels like
This world's gone crazy
Grandpa, take me back to yesterday
Where the line between right and wrong
Didn't seem so hazy

Did lovers really fall in love to stay
Stand beside each other come what may
Was a promise really something people kept
Not just something they would say
Did families really bow their heads to pray
Did daddies really never go away
Whoa oh Grandpa
Tell me 'bout the good old days

Musical interlude

Grandpa
Everything is changing fast
We call it progress
But I just don't know
And Grandpa, let's wonder back into the past
And paint me a picture of long ago

Did lovers really fall in love to stay
Stand beside each other come what may
Was a promise really something people kept
Not just something they would say and then forget
Did families really bow their heads to pray
Did daddies really never go away
Whoa oh Grandpa

Heaven knows that I'm born too late
For these ghosts that I chase
With these dreams, I inflate, painted skies in my brain
Every day, I'm Carl Sagan in space
To escape this old world, this old world
Some days I lie wide awake 'til the sun hits my face
And I fade, elevate from the Earth
Far away to a place where I'm free from the weight
This old world, this old world

I don't trust anything
Or anyone, below the sun
And I don't feel anything

I'm king of the clouds, of the clouds

King of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted

[Verse 2]
Some only live to die, I'm alive to fly higher
Than angels in outfields inside of my mind
I'm ascendin' these ladders, I'm climbin', say goodbye
This old world, this old world
And when I fall to rise with stardust in my eyes
In the backbone of night, I'm combustible
Dust in the fire when I can't sleep a wink, I'm too tired
This old world, this old world

341,Wings,"[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I was seven years old when I got my first pair
And I stepped outside, and I was like ""Momma
This air bubble right here, it's gonna make me fly""
I hit that court, and when I jumped
I jumped, I swear I got so high
""I touched the net! Mom, I touched the net!
This is the best day of my life""
Air Maxes were next, that air bubble, that mesh
The box, the smell, the stuffing, the thread, at school
I was so cool, I knew that I couldn't crease 'em
My friends couldn't afford 'em, four stripes on their Adidas
On the court I wasn't the best, but my kicks were like the pros, yo
Stick out my tongue so everyone could see that logo
Nike Air Flight, book bag was so dope
And then my friend Carlos's brother got murdered for his Fours
Whoa
See he just wanted a jump shot
But they wanted his Starter coat, though
Didn't wanna get caught from Genesee Park to Othello
You'd get clowned for those Pro Wings, with the velcro, those were not tight
I was tryna fly, without leaving the ground
'Cause I wanted to be like Mike, right, wanted to be him
I wanted to be that guy, I wanted to touch the rim
I wanted to be cool, and I wanted to fit in
I wanted what he had, America, it begins

[Hook: Children Choir]
I wanna fly, can you take me far away?
Give me a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes
And I'll go so high, I'll go so high
My feet won't touch the ground
Just stitch my wings and pull the strings
I bought these dreams that all fall down

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
We want what we can't have
The commodity makes us want it
So expensive, damn, I just got to flaunt it
Got to show 'em
So exclusive, this that new shit
A hundred dollars for a pair of shoes, I would never hoop in
Look at me, look at me, I'm a cool kid
I'm an individual, yeah, but I'm part of a movement
My movement told me ""Be a consumer""
And I consumed it
They told me to just do it
I listened to what that swoosh said
Look at what that swoosh did
See it consumed my thoughts
""Are you stupid? Don’t crease 'em! Just leave 'em in that box!""
Strangled by these laces, laces I can barely talk
That's my air bubble and I'm lost, if it pops
We are what we wear, we wear what we are
But see I look inside the mirror and think Phil Knight tricked us all
Will I stand for change, or stay in my box?
These Nikes help me define me
But I'm trying to take mine off

[Hook: Children Choir]
I wanna fly, can you take me far away?
Give me a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes
And I'll go so high, I'll go so high
My feet won't touch the ground
Just stitch my wings and pull the strings
I bought these dreams that all fall down

[Outro: Macklemore]
They started out with what I wear to school
That first day
Like these are what make you cool
And this pair, this would be my parachute
So much more than just a pair of shoes
Nah, this is what I am
What I wore, this is the source of my youth
This dream that they sold to you
For a hundred dollars and some change
Consumption is in the veins

343,Daylight,"[Verse 1]
My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight

[Verse 2]
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (Daylight), I only see daylight (Daylight)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight

[Bridge]
And I can still see it all (In my mind)
All of you, all of me (Intertwined)
I once believed love would be (Black and white)
But it's golden (Golden)
And I can still see it all (In my head)
Back and forth from New York (Sneaking in your bed)
I once believed love would be (Burning red)
But it's golden
Like daylight, like daylight
Like daylight, daylight

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
And I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (I see daylight), I only see daylight (Ah)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (Ah)
(And I can still see it all)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(And I can still see it all, back and forth from New York)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(I once believed love would be burning red)

[Outro]
Like daylight
It's golden like daylight
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
Just let it go, let it go

[Spoken Outro]
I wanna be defined by the things that I love
Not the things I hate
Not the things I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of
Or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night

I was gonna keep it real like chill like only have a drink or two
But it turned into a party when I started talking to you
Now you're standing in the neon looking like a high I wanna be on
Baby it's your call, no pressure at all

[Chorus: Blake Shelton]
You don’t have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter and lean a little closer
You don’t have to keep on smiling that smile that’s driving me wild and when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat and do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don’t have to keep me fallin’ like this
But it’d sure be cool if you did

[Verse 2: Blake Shelton]
You can’t shoot me down cause you already knocked me dead
Got me falling apart with my heart talking out of my head
Let your mind take a little back road
Just as far as you wanna go
Baby I’ll do whatever you wanna do

You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter
And lean a little closer
You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild

We can pack up tomorrow, tonight let's flip a coin

Heads Carolina, tails California
Somewhere greener, somewhere warmer
Up in the mountains, down by the ocean
Where, it don't matter as long as we're going
Somewhere together, I've got a quarter
Heads Carolina, tails California

We can load what we own in the back of a U-Haul van
Couple of modern day Moses' searching for the promised land
We can go four hundred miles before we stop for gas
We can drive for a day and then we'll take a look at the map

If we have to ride a Greyhound bus

Je m'rappelle quand c'était fucked up
J'vivais la misère au jour le jour
J'écris ma peine dans un bloc-notes
J'voyais ma daronne à cours de sous
Quand personne avait confiance en moi
Tout est plus beau quand j'suis hors de moi
Contrôle de police à chaque soir, pas loin d'en faire sur le boulevard
Devant le bloc avec MK, violent la société m'aime pas
2017 j'suis le même gars, beaucoup de haine mais ça m'touche pas
Déçu des gens j'ai fait plein de fois
Quand tous ces rêves étaient loin de moi
J'faisais du sale j'avais pas l'choix, depuis j'les reconnais même pas
Y'avait qu'ma mère et ma conscience pour m'consoler quand j'étais seul
J'les ai toutes baisées, depuis j'ai compris qu'c'était tout ce qu'elles veulent
Premier sold-out j'les vois tous autour, j'serai sûrement tout seul au bout du gouffre
Tout c'que j'ai pu donner sans retour, Dieu merci maintenant c'est loin de nous, loin de nous

Yeah, le ciel est proche babe
Tu peux tout perdre en deux minutes
Leur haine est forte mais heureusement qu'l'argent nous stimule

Faut plus l'arroser quand la fleur est morte, maintenant tu sais qu't'avais tort
Y'avait qu'ma mère et ma conscience pour m'consoler quand j'étais seul
J'les ai toutes baisées depuis j'ai compris qu'c'était tout ce qu'elles veulent

J'ai tout ce qu'elles veulent
Notre amour est mort, j'fais le deuil
J'fais couler ma peine sur une feuille
C'est toujours le diable qui m'accueille, je sais qu'un jour j'finirai seul

357,Sweet Nothing,"[Verse 1: Florence Welch]
You took my heart, and you held it in your mouth
And with a word all my love came rushing out
And every whisper, it's the worst
Emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now

[Chorus: Florence Welch]
So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm trying to hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing

[Verse 2: Florence Welch]
It isn't easy for me to let it go
'Cause I've swallowed every single word
And every whisper, every sigh
Eats away at this heart of mine
And there is a hollow in me now

So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm trying to hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing

The wound heals but it never does
That’s cause you're at war with love
You're at war with love, yeah

[Chorus: Guy Sebastian]
These battle scars don’t look like they’re fading
Don’t look like they’re ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Never let a wound ruin me
But I feel like ruin's ruin me
Arrow holes that never close from Cupid on a shooting spree
Feeling stupid cause I know it ain't no you and me
But when you're trying to beat the odds up
Been trying to keep your nods up and you know that you should know
And let her go but the fear of the unknown
Holding on another lover's phone sends you back into the zone
(Go!) With no Tom Hanks to bring you home
A lover not a fighter on the frontline with a poem
Trying to write yourself a rifle, maybe sharpen up a song
To fight the tanks and drones of you being alone

[Pre-Chorus: Guy Sebastian]
I wish I never looked, I wish I never touched
I wish that I could stop loving you so much
'Cause I’m the only one that's tryna keep us together
When all of the signs say that I should forget her
I wish you weren’t the best, the best I ever had
I wish that the good outweighed the bad
'Cause it’ll never be over, until you tell me it's over

[Chorus: Guy Sebastian]
These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading
Don’t look like they’re ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading
Don’t look like they’re ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
(And just leave then)
You shouldn't have but you said it
(And I hope you never come back)
It shouldn't have happened but you let it
Now you're down on the ground screaming ""medic""
The only thing that comes is the post-traumatic stresses
Shields, body armors and vests
Don't properly work, that's why you're in a locker full of hurt
The enemy within and all the fires from your friends
The best medicine is to probably just let her win

[Pre-Chorus 2: Guy Sebastian]
I wish I couldn't feel, I wish I couldn't love
I wish that I could stop cause it hurts so much
'Cause I’m the only one that's trying to keep us together
When all of the signs say that I should forget her
I wish you weren’t the best, the best I ever had
I wish that the good outweighed the bad
'Cause it’ll never be over, until you tell me it's over

366,Memories Back Then,"[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ayy, in my apartment a long time ago
I knew a bad bitch, but she was kinda slow
Still gave it up when it's a few of us
She let me finger-fuck her on the school bus
We used to cut school with her and run train
She wanted to hang with us, we wanted one thang
Just penetratin' that throat, dawg
She choked on it like smoke, dawg
But whenever I fucked up my re-up
In a dice game I go see her
She'll give me enough to buy a quarter ounce
And then blow a blunt of that reefer
She used to buy a nigga new sneakers
Pay the bill on my beeper
Just so she can page to put a ""69""
And I know it time to go freak her
Then one day I just asked her
""Why you always give your ass up?
I mean, damn, these hoes get paid
All you do is get laid—this shit don't add up.""
She said, ""Tip, all I wanna do is feel love
Even if I know it ain't real love
Even if I know a nigga only finna hit it
And then never call back, I still fuck.""
And that's fucked up, but she so trill
I need somethin', she go steal
When the trap hot and police ride
Nigga, guess where we go chill?
For 'bout four years she held dope
And my four pounds 'til it go down
I remember shawty, she stayed down
I won't say her name ‘cause she married now

[Hook: Kris Stephens]
When the lights go out
And I'm in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head
All of the things that I did back then
When I'm in my bed
I think of all the memories I've had
All of the things I did back then

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
She would always turn heads when she'd fall through
She would always make moves how a boss do
And she never gave any nigga time of day
But she the chick all the niggas tried to talk to
But when it came to me, she had a thing for me
When we kicked it she roll up the weed for me
And we'd both cut class post up in the cut steady
Watchin' just to see if the police comin'
We got close over time, her and I
Right around the time that I first got signed
Come to think about it I was 'bout 17
I ain't even have a license, couldn't even drive
I was goin' back and forth with each flight
Another show after show, each night
She became so suspicious of these other bitches
She'd go through my phone and we'd fight
Talk about torn between the two
Wasn't really much more that we could do
Wasn't really much space for us
But she stayed down with every tour she seen me do
But I guess one night I had a few
Huh, one night I had a few
Yeah, this little chick that caught my eye
I told her: ""Hurry up, meet me at the room!""
And no, I didn't have a contraceptive
What my common sense neglected
And two months later, next thing I know
I got a text that said ""I'm pregnant""
And you can almost bet she kept it
And that's the reason why you left me
On top of all that, it wasn't even mine
I went and got paternity tested—damn!

[Hook: Kris Stephens]
When the lights go out
And I'm in my bed

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Wait, hol' up, is that you?
With them big ol' thighs after school?
Jay 305 had gave me high five
When I said I’m in hot pursuit
You said I won’t ride until Kendrick drive
A new Monte Carlo that cruise
And that shot my pride, I tried to improv
But no freestyle I never do
You lookin' for the nigga with the tallest 'fetti
You overlookin' every nigga that ain’t quite ready
To make it rain on you like I'm about to break a levee
Hol' up, that pussy petty
Yeah, your nails did, your hair did
Your cell phone is selfish
It only got numbers that come with a Hummer
Her new prima donna I smelt it
Tried to make you mine, ho!
Tried to make some time, ho!
But I ain’t got the time or the patience
To stop and wait in line, ho!
Her dreams holds Versace
She fall for Armani
Only deal with rich niggas—fuck you and Mick Romney!
I’m grown now, I’m on my own now
I’m po-o-o-oppin'
Change my phone now when I get home now
I got o-o-o-options
Fast forward, wait, is that you?
With them big ol' thighs after school?
And your three kids and three baby daddies
Same car note that’s overdue? I know

Living life like it’s my job, and I don’t ever take a day off

So hold my hand, I'll walk with you my dear
The stairs creak as you sleep; it's keeping me awake
It's the house telling you to close your eyes
Some days I can't even dress myself
It's killing me to see you this way

Bodies safe to shore

Soon it will be over and buried with our past
We used to play outside when we were young, and full of life and full of love

Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear

Bodies safe to shore

I could tell you was into me from our instant chemistry
As I reflect memory, you ride or you die for me

You know what it is shawty, forever my lil shawty
Long as I’m swimmin’ in Benjamins, you shop with no limited
You reminisce every session, know you’ll come back again
I know you can’t breath without me, you gon' need your oxygen
I damn near gave you a overdose on my own medicine

You could leave today I bet you’ll come back tomorrow

If I did come your way and you feel like runnin’
Run in my direction and don’t you run from me

Is there anything you wanna know?
Is there any place you rather be?
You walk until your feet get sore

378,Accidental Racist,"[Verse 1: Brad Paisley]
To the man that waited on me at the Starbucks down on Main
I hope you understand
When I put on that t-shirt, the only thing I meant to say
Is I'm a Skynyrd fan
The red flag on my chest somehow is
Like the elephant in the corner of the south
And I just walked him right in the room
Just a proud rebel son with an ol' can of worms
Lookin' like I got a lot to learn, but from my point of view

[Chorus: Brad Paisley]
I'm just a white man coming to you from the Southland
Tryin' to understand what it's like not to be
I'm proud of where I'm from but not everything we've done
And it ain't like you and me can re-write history
Our generation didn't start this nation
We're still picking up the pieces, walking on eggshells, fighting over yesterday
And caught between Southern pride and Southern blame

[Verse 2: Brad Paisley]
They called it Reconstruction, fixed the buildings, dried some tears
We're still siftin' through the rubble after a hundred-fifty years
I try to put myself in your shoes and that's a good place to begin
But it ain't like I can walk a mile in someone else's skin

[Chorus: Brad Paisley]
'Cause I'm a white man livin' in the southland
Just like you I'm more than what you see
I'm proud of where I'm from but not everything we've done
And it ain't like you and me can re-write history
Our generation didn't start this nation
And we're still paying for our mistakes
That a bunch of folks made long before we came
And caught somewhere between southern pride and southern blame

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
Dear Mr. White Man, I wish you understood
What the world is really like when you're living in the hood
Just because my pants are sagging doesn't mean I'm up to no good
You should try to get to know me, I really wish you would
Now my chains are gold but I'm still misunderstood
I wasn't there when Sherman's March turned the south into firewood
I want you to get paid but be a slave I never could
Feel like a new fangled Django, dodging invisible white hoods
So when I see that white cowboy hat, I'm thinking it's not all good
I guess we're both guilty of judging the cover not the book
I'd love to buy you a beer, conversate and clear the air
But I see that red flag and I think you wish I wasn't here

[Chorus: Brad Paisley (w/ LL Cool J ad libs)]
I'm just a white man
(If you don't judge my do-rag)
Comin' to you from the southland
(I won't judge your red flag)
Tryin' to understand what it's like not to be
(Yeah)
I'm proud of where I'm from
(If you don't judge my gold chains)
But not everything we've done
(I'll forget the iron chains)
It ain't like you and me can re-write history
(Can't re-write history baby)

[Verse 4: Brad Paisley (LL Cool J)]
Oh, Dixieland
(The relationship between the Mason-Dixon needs some fixin')
I hope you understand what this is all about
(Quite frankly I'm a black Yankee
But I've been thinkin' about this lately)
I'm a son of the new south
(The past is the past, you feel me)
And I just want to make things right
(Let bygones be bygones)
Where all that's left is southern pride

But I've gotta thank Abraham Lincoln for freeing me

It's truth",Brad Paisley,2013,[77],1

Pull up in a new plate and she might just
She weren't tryna move bait when our eyes locked
New tints on the coupé, that's a head loss
Off my whites, right my wrongs
Gucci my mom while you twiddle your thumbs
Count my sums, this is gonna get long
Love my green, I'm tryna get strong
Tryna get on, where I'm from, it's on

'Cause they won't cuss, 'cause they said I sold drugs
And when you down there, ain't nobody around
Where's the comeback? When you blow up
I forgot my jacket but my heated seats help me warm up

Used to say I wanna put Tottenham on the map

Remember back in the days when niggas had waves
Cazal shades and corn braids?
Pitching pennies, honeys had the high-top jellies
Shooting skelly, motherfuckers was all friendly
Lounging at the barbecues, drinking brews
With the neighborhood crews hanging on the avenues
Turn your pages to 1993
Niggas is getting smoked, G, believe me
Talk slick, you get your neck slit quick
'Cause real street niggas ain't having that shit
Totin' TECs for rep
Smoking blunts in the project hallways
Shooting dice all day
Waitin' for niggas to step up on some fightin' shit

So step away with your fistfight ways

Instead of a MAC-10, he tried scrappin'
Slugs in his back and that's what the fuck happens
When you sleep on the street
Little motherfuckers with heat wanna leave a nigga six feet deep
And we coming to the wake
To make sure the crying and commotion ain't a motherfucking fake

Look at 'em now, they even fuckin' scared of us
Calling the city for help because they can't maintain

Eatin' five cent gums, not knowing where your meal's coming from

Making time for the ones that count
I'll spend the rest of my time
Laughing hard with the windows down
Leaving footprints all over town
Keeping faith, karma comes around
I will spend the rest of my life

[Pre-Chorus]
Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right

[Chorus]
Catch my breath
No one can hold me back, I ain't got time for that
Catch my breath
Won't let 'em get me down, it's all so simple now

[Bridge]
You helped me see
The beauty in everything

[Pre-Chorus]
Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right
Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right

[Chorus]

Catch my breath
No one can hold me back, I ain't got time for that
Catch my breath
Won't let 'em get me down, it's all so simple now

But some kind of madness is swallowing me whole, yeah

And I have finally realized what you mean

386,Poetic Justice,"[Produced by Scoop DeVille & Sounwave]

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Every second, every minute
Man, I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
Hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now
Put me in the mood
I'm talkin' about dark room, perfume, go, go

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I recognize your fragrance
Hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit
Uh, and I know your taste is
A little bit, hmm, high maintenance
Uh, everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em?
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends
And y'all curled in that little bitty Range
I heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs
'Less I write it down for real, P.S

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

[Verse 2: Drake]
I really hope you play this, 'cause ol' girl, you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs
And all these one-off vacations you've been takin'
Clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin' with your other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your momma to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's alright here in the city
And you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin
And your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doin' that walk for?
When I see that thing move
I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
They say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs
Unless I write 'em down for real, P.S

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talkin' poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it? I mean, you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' for it, maybe
Call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it
Uh-huh, that's your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, uh-huh
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, P.S

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song

[Outro Skit]
""I'm gon' ask you one more time, homie
Where is you from? Or it is a problem.""
""Ayy, you over here for Sherane, homie?""
""Yo, I don't care who this nigga over here for

Condoms are for practice, man, I skip practice
Flip backwards while I flip this bike on its banana seat
My fantasy is to have you land where the kickstand is

Realizin' I was in too deep
She was a lesson
I had to learn, I had to learn, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
I used to try to forget her
But now I smile when I remember
Ooh

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Leaves are fallin' in September
The night came in, it made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young 'til she kissed me
Like a whiskey, like a whiskey
Ooh, like a whiskey, ooh

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Would've left this world behind
Just to wake up by your side
Every mornin', I would've sold my soul for a lil' more time
Would've waited a thousand nights
If she never said goodbye
I admit that I
Would've sold my soul for a little more time
Ooh

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
I used to try to forget her
But now I smile when I remember

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Leaves are fallin', it's September
The night came in, it made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young 'til she kissed me
Like a whiskey, like a whiskey

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
I ain't like the other Cognacs
Or type of cat that'd never call back
Or lose contact when you runnin' out of rum and you make a run
(Feelin' light and dizzy, might be tipsy)
All of that tequila's a killer, little vodka
Break her off somethin' proper
Pop a cork and play spin the bottle
(Every time you kiss me, like some whiskey)
Punch drunk love, it's a fine line
Dom Pérignon, she the fine wine
Someone call 911, I'm runnin' out of time
She done got off with my heart

[Chorus: Adam Levine & (A$AP Rocky)]
Leaves are fallin', it's September (oh)
The night came in, it made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young (so young)
'Til she kissed me (yeah)
Like a whiskey (yeah)
And I was so young (so young)

Telling me to come with her, underneath my comforter
And she brought a gun with her, pills and some rum with her
Took me on the balcony, telling me to jump with her

Merry go round...
Look...

[Verse 1]
Summer day
Bobby and this girl would wake up every summer day
This boy and girl had nothing, they were runaways
So in love that now all they wanted was pain and so it came
Never had a silver spoon present in the past
Now at last, the spoon is present and so the boy wet it
Told her bring him a slab, a cotton swab, and a match
And told her one day they’ll fly across the world and have a wedding
Like “baby I have a plan, come with me to this place
Baby give me your hand, now flip it give me a vein
Baby take off your belt, we’ll use it as a restraint”
She sees that it starts to melt, he reaches inside a case
Fills the needle with food, flicks the needle with haste
Brings the needle to her, she isn’t right in the face
The boy can tell that she’s scared, he says “I love you, okay?”
Then shoves it into her arm and says “how the fuck does that taste baby?!”

Swiggin’ out of a whiskey bottle, he just watches
But he was not Bobby, see Bobby had joined the army
Been gone for a couple months now she’s messin with everybody
Everyone of the dealers, everyone hears her squealing
Trading pussy for product, she did anything for that feeling
But then she started that feeling, early morning she’s kneelin’
In front of the toilet look at her belly there’s no concealing
That she’s expecting a child
This woman is living foul
She’s only 20 years old
And hardly can even smile
Ultrasound shows a baby that’s barely over a pound
Sold everything in her house just trying to score an ounce
News of her baby’s father was that he died in the war
Now that syringe is all that keeps her alive anymore
No mattress, so her and her child dyin’ on the floor
As a letter’s at the door reading:
“I’ll be home tomorrow. love, Bobby”

[Hook]
Merry, merry, merry go round
I don’t want to see you down
I don’t want to see you frown
Merry go round...
Merry, merry, merry go round
I don’t want to see you down
I don’t want to see you frown
Merry, merry, merry go round

[Verse 3]
Knockin’ at the door but doesn’t get an answer
Bobby’s nervous, his heart starts to beat faster
He hasn’t talked to his girl in so long
She sold his phone for a hit, damn how he wish that he could hear her laughter
But his drug hit her like a cancer
And he forgot ‘cause he had left and cleaned his act up
Passenger seat in his Acura got a picture of ‘em kissing
Under the words ""happily ever after”
He walks into the house, it’s a fuckin’ disaster
Every step he takes his shoe crushes a capsule
Holds his breath, he knows what he smells isn’t natural
Looks down, it’s the body of the queen of his castle
“Baby please, baby please!!!""
""Wake up!!!”
He screams on his knees and he sees her hands around her stomach
Inside was a child
And realizes it was his…
*gun shot*
Summer day, 
An entire family died on that summer day
‘cause a facade made a girl give her love away
But those were Bobby’s consequences that he had to pay
Love is pain

Well, I grew up in one of them old farm towns
Where they hit it hard 'til the sun goes down
Nobody really seemed to care
That we were living in the middle of nowhere
We just figured that’s how it was
And everybody else was just like us
Soaking in the rain, baking in the sun
Don’t quit 'til the job gets done

[Chorus]
That’s the only way I know
Don’t stop 'til everything’s gone
Straight ahead, never turn around
Don’t back up, don’t back down
A full throttle, wide open
You get tired and you don’t show it
Dig a little deeper when you think you can’t dig no more
That’s the only way I know

[Verse 2: Luke Bryan & Jason Aldean]
That old red dirt, the first thing you learn
Is you don’t get nothing that you don’t earn
Humble pride I grew up on
You find out just how bad you want it
The sun in our eyes and backs to the fences
We didn’t know the odds were against us
Hit the wall smoking and spinning
Still wasn’t thinking ‘bout nothing but winning

[Chorus]
That’s the only way I know
Don’t stop 'til everything’s gone
Straight ahead, never turn around
Don’t back up, don’t back down
A full throttle, wide open
You get tired and you don’t show it
Dig a little deeper when you think you can’t dig no more
That’s the only way I know

[Bridge: Eric Church]
Maybe there’s another path that
Will get you there a little bit faster
But I’m sticking with the one inside of me

That’s the only way I know
Don’t stop 'til everything’s gone
Straight ahead, never turn around
Don’t back up, don’t back down
A full throttle, wide open
You get tired and you don’t show it
Dig a little deeper when you think you can’t dig no more
That's the only way I

That’s the only way I know
But don’t stop 'til everything’s gone

But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
What do I stand for?
What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know anymore

[Verse 1]
This is it, boys, this is war
What are we waiting for?
Why don't we break the rules already?

Save that for the black and white
Try twice as hard and I'm half as liked
But here they come again to jack my style

I found a martyr in my bed tonight
She stops my bones from wondering
Just who I, who, I, who I am
Oh, who am I?

Well, some nights, I wish that this all would end
'Cause I could use some friends for a change
And some nights, I'm scared you'll forget me again
Some nights, I always win (I always win)
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
What do I stand for?
What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know

[Bridge 1]
(Oh, come on) So this is it?
I sold my soul for this?
Washed my hands of that for this?
I miss my mom and dad for this?
(Oh, come on) No
When I see stars, when I see stars, that's all they are
When I hear songs, they sound like a swan
So, come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on
Oh, come on

Well, that is it, guys, that is all
Five minutes in and I'm bored again
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands
This one is not for the folks back home
Sorry to leave, Mom, I had to go
Who the fuck wants to die alone
All dried up in the desert sun?

My heart is breaking for my sister
And the con that she called ""love""
And then I look into my nephew's eyes
Man, you wouldn't believe the most amazing things
That can come from

I won't deny what they saying because most of it is true
But it was all before I fell for you, so please, babe

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
So please don't judge me and I won't judge you
'Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful
Please don't judge me and I won't judge you
And if you love me, then let it be beautiful

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
(Oh)
Let it be beautifu-u-ul (Oh)
Let it be beautiful (Oh)
Let it be beautifu-u-ul (Oh)
Let it be beautiful

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Everything I say right now is gonna be used in another fight
And I've been through this so many times
Can we change the subject?
You gonna start asking me questions like
""Was she attractive? Was she an actress?""
Baby, the fact is

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
You're hearing rumors about me and saw some pictures online
Saying they got you so angry, making you wish you were blind
Before we start talking crazy, saying some things we'll regret
Can we just slow it down and press reset? (Damn)
You're beautiful, so baby

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
(So baby)
So please don't judge me and I won't judge you
'Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful
Please don't judge me and I won't judge you
And if you love me, then let it be beautiful

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Just let the past, just be the past
And focused on things that are gonna make us laugh
Take me as I am (Take me as I am) and not who I was (Not who I was)
I'll promise I'll be the one that you can trust, so please

[Chorus: Chris Brown, with Sevyn Streeter]
So please don't judge me (Don't judge me)
And I won't judge you (And I won't 'cause)
'Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful
So please don't judge me and I won't judge you (No, I won't)
And if you love me (If you love me), then let it be beautiful, babe

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown & Sevyn Streeter]
Let it be beautifu-u-ul (Oh, ooh)
Let it be beautiful (Let it)
Let it be, oh

417,Buzzkill,"[Hook]

Ain't seen it all but I think I've seen enough
Still basically hated, jaded, acting like a buzzkill
I'm too used to these nights being fun-filled
Baby baby I don't want to be a buzzkill
I don't want to be a buzzkill but the battle's always uphill
I need something new until I quit being such a buzzkill

[Verse 1: Intuition]

Look I was raised in the sticks but I love me some city life
This urban sprawl got me running with some shifty types
Slept through the sun due to fun from the fifty nights
I just spent searching for someone to kiss me right
This overdriver that'll still make the party rock
Sleep with girls that's hardly hot to prove that I'm an artsy snob
I'm everywhere but I'm always showing tardy dawg
Fashionably late's better than early when I'm on my job
My team sticker hit you with the flea flicker
We'll run her past your spot depends on the free liquor
There'd better be some pseudo-celebs or scene sisters
If we don't see Lindsay or Hayden, you bet we'll leave quicker
People ask me why I look so bored
It's cause I'm by my idols so much I ain't shook no more
I blow some smoke from my lungs looking broke as a bum
Backstage at the venue having no fucking fun
Done too many drugs, seen too many people
Get too many shuns after too many evils
And today has just begun, it's got too many sequels
So I made this little number, here's what two pennies equals

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Slug]

I gotta get far away from the city man
I hate my job and I'm sick of my shitty band
All I can do is get drunk as the night is long
Stay inside and get high just to write my song
My girl's at the corner bar getting blasted too
She'll be back just a few minutes after two
She gets pissed cause I sound just like her dad
I pop shit like who picked up your tab?
Go ahead and cry yourself to sleep
And I'll pour another drink for myself to think
But best believe when the VCR clock says four
Guaranteed I'll be knocking on that bedroom door
Switch it up, sing a different tune
Creep beneath the sheet and move in for the spoon
With my hands on your hips cause I'm asking for sex
With my cigarette breath on the back of your neck
Yeah, it often happens out of habit
Open door like the grocery store, automatic
Go deep, ocean floor, smashed in
Buzzkill for asking if she faked the orgasm

418,Little Things,"[Verse 1: Zayn & Liam & Both]
Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me
But bear this in mind it was meant to be
And I'm joining up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks
And it all makes sense to me
I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes
When you smile, you've never loved your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine
But I’ll love them endlessly

[Chorus: Zayn and Liam]
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if I do, it's you, oh it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things

[Verse 2: Louis & Harry & Harry and Louis & Harry and Niall]
You can't go to bed without a cup of tea
Maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep
Though it makes no sense to me
I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much you weigh
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me

[Chorus: Harry and Niall & Harry]
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true, it's you, it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things

[Bridge: Niall]
You never love yourself half as much as I love you
You'll never treat yourself right darling but I want you to
If I let you know, I'm here for you
Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you, oh

[Chorus: Harry & All]
And I've just let these little things slip out of my mouth
'Cause it's you, oh it's you, it's you they add up to
And I'm in love with you and all these little things

Not what you'd think

It might've been a nightmare

If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""

[Verse 2]
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And set her world on fire
And watch her sway and singing to the music

Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)

[Verse 1]
Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes
Lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me

[Chorus]
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it

[Verse 2]
Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me
Then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now
And I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down
I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted
As soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently, I'm over-influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me

[Chorus]
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock

Hop out, do you bang?

Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang

(Pool full of Kendrick's lies in it)
Aw man… where is she takin' me?
Where is she takin' me?
(Pool full of liquor ima die in it)

[Verse 3]
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do, then you're like me
Makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release
Everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh?
Don't you feel bad? I probably sleep
And never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough

[Outro]
They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
K-Dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off
That nigga's straight, man, that nigga ain't trippin'
We gon' do the same ol' shit
I'ma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways
Fall right in ****'s lap
And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that
And I hope that bitch that set him up out there
We gon' pop that bitch too
Wait hold up, ayy, I see somebody
[Car door opens and gunshots are fired]

I don't know why
You think that you could hold me
When you couldn't get by by yourself
And I don't know who
Would ever want to tear the seam of someone's dream
Baby, it's fine, you said that we should just be friends
Well I came up with that line and I'm sure
That it's for the best
If you ever change your mind, don't hold your breath

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you may not believe
That baby, I'm relieved
When you said goodbye, my whole world shined

Hey hey hey
It's a beautiful day and I can't stop myself from smiling
If we're drinking, then I'm buying
And I know there's no denying
It's a beautiful day, the sun is up, the music's playing
And even if it started raining
You wouldn't hear this boy complaining
'Cause I'm glad that you're the one that got away
It's a beautiful day

[Verse 2]
It's my turn to fly, so girls, get in line
'Cause I'm easy, no playing this guy like a fool
'Cause now I'm alright
You might've had me caged before, but not tonight

And you may not believe
That baby, I'm relieved
This fire inside, it burns too bright
I don't want to say “so long”, I just want to say “goodbye”

It's a beautiful day and I can't stop myself from smiling
If we're drinking, then I'm buying
And I know there's no denying

You wouldn't hear this boy complaining
'Cause I'm glad that you're the one that got away

My time with thinking of our break-up

Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries

'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly

Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

[Chorus]
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly

[Bridge]
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyes and hopin' for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

[Alternate Chorus]
And we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly

431,Die Young,"[Intro]
We got London on the track
I'm in London, got my beat from London

[Chorus]
I ain't tryna die young, so I gotta ride with one
Stood ten toes down in my Balenciaga, ayy
He ran down on a nigga, that’s a shotta, shotta
Cold hearted nigga, wet tha blocka, blocka
Gotta keep it on me, I don't wanna die young
I rather be judged by twelve, than carried by six
How am I gon' post bail? Just look at my wrist
Tell me, why the legends always gotta die quick?

[Verse 1]
When I'm in traffic gotta slide with the beam on me
'Cause I keep 'bout ten racks bussin' out the jeans on me
Niggas be hatin', I'm rich, it's all about the cream, homie
If I ever get caught lackin', they gon' slide
Ever since I got the Rollie, I ain't got the time
Flawless diamonds, niggas can't never block the shine
They know I'm ballin' in the city like DeRozan
Gotta keep my niggas 'round me, I can't do the wrong friends
I was knockin' down walls, now they closin' in
Hopped off the porch, and then I hopped inside the Porsche, ayy
Fuck being the side nigga, I'ma be the main course
Whipped the Rolls like a young nigga made for it

[Chorus]
I ain't tryna die young, so I gotta ride with one
Stood ten toes down in my Balenciaga, ayy
He ran down on a nigga, that’s a shotta, shotta
Cold hearted nigga wet that blocka, blocka
Gotta keep it on me, I don't wanna die young
I rather be judged by twelve, than carried by six
How am I gon' post bail? Just look at my wrist
Tell me, why the legends always gotta die quick?

[Verse 2]
Tryna get my bag, I had to go and make it happen
Me and my dogs, we was bussin' out them bandos
Count out them hunnids, then we throw it in the mattress
Wrap it in plastic, and throw it in the attic
I be in the streets, nigga, I stand ten toes
Any nigga in my situation would've been fold
We was trappin' out the basement, made it back tenfold
Gotta stay out the way, that's why I'm always behind the tint for
We was fightin' fed cases, 'member I was 2 and 0
Nigga was fightin' depression, sippin' syrup, I was movin' slow
I was down below, but still, I always kept my head up
Nigga gotta get my bread up, I don't wanna die young
No, no, no

[Chorus]
I ain't tryna die young, so I gotta ride with one
Stood ten toes down in my Balenciaga
He ran down on a nigga, that’s a shotta, shotta
Cold hearted nigga wet that blocka, blocka
Gotta keep it on me, I don't wanna die young
I rather be judged by twelve, than carried by six
How am I gon' post bail? Just look at my wrist

432,Hold On,"[Verse 1]
Loving and fighting
Accusing, denying
I can't imagine a world with you gone
The joy and the chaos, the demons we're made of
I'd be so lost if you left me alone
You locked yourself in the bathroom
Lying on the floor when I break through
I pull you in to feel your heartbeat
Can you hear me screaming, ""Please don't leave me!""

[Chorus]
Hold on, I still want you
Come back, I still need you
Let me take your hand, I'll make it right
I swear to love you all my life
Hold on, I still need you

[Verse 2]
Long endless highway, you're silent beside me
Driving a nightmare I can't escape from
Helplessly praying, the light isn't fading
Hiding the shock and the chill in my bones
They took you away on a table
I pace back and forth as you lay still
They pull you in to feel your heartbeat
Can you hear me screaming, ""Please don't leave me!""

[Chorus]
Hold on, I still want you
Come back, I still need you
Let me take your hand, I'll make it right
I swear to love you all my life
Hold on, I still need you

[Bridge]
I don't wanna let go
I know I'm not that strong
I just wanna hear you
Saying ""baby, let's go home""
Let's go home
Yeah, I just wanna take you home

Hold on, I still want you
Come back, I still need you",Chord Overstreet,2013,"[93, 100]",2
433,Anything Could Happen,"[Verse 1]
Stripped to the waist we fall into the river
Cover your eyes so you don't know the secret
I've been trying to hide
We held our breath to see our names are written
On the wreck of '86
That was the year I knew the panic was over

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Yes, since we found out
Since we found out

[Hook]
That anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could

[Verse 2]
After the war, we said we'd fight together
I guess we thought that's just what humans do
Letting darkness grow
As if we need its palette and we need its color

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But now I've seen it through
And now I know the truth

[Hook]
That anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could

[Bridge 1]
Baby, I'll give you everything you need
I'll give you everything you need, oh
I'll give you everything you need
But I don't think I need you

Stripped to the waist we fall into the river
Cover your eyes so you don't know the secret

434,Goodbye In Her Eyes,"[Verse 1]
I could tell that it was over
When her lips met mine
There was an emptiness in her voice
Hesitation when she smiled
She didn't have to say a word
It was just so plain to see
She'd found what she'd been looking for
And I knew it wasn't me

[Chorus 1]
I saw goodbye in her eyes
I don't think I can change it
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I feel like a clown
Can't wash off his makeup
The life she wanted, it was gone
Prince Charming I wasn't
But I would trade a thousand Babylons
To be in her arms tomorrow
Oh, but like the tide, her love has come and gone
And it's time for me to go

[Chorus 2]
I saw goodbye in her eyes
I don't think I can change it
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it (now she sees right through me)
Should I hold on to what we have got?
Is it just a waste of time?
One thing that I know for sure
I saw goodbye in her eyes
I saw goodbye in her eyes

[Bridge]
I know you got somebody new now
All my candles have burned out
He is going to love the way you shine (so did I)
So did I
So don't smile at me if it ain't what you mean
(Goodbye)

[Chorus 3]
With that goodbye in your eyes
I know that I can't change it (now you see right through me)
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it
I saw goodbye in your eyes
I know that I can't change it (now you see right through me goodbye in your eyes)
Should I hold on?
We will never make it (now you see right through me goodbye in your eyes)
Should I hold on?
Is it just a waste of time?
One thing that I know for sure
I saw goodbye in your eyes

435,Somebody That I Used To Know,"[Verse 1: Gotye]
Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

[Verse 2: Gotye]
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

[Chorus: Gotye]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

[Verse 3: Kimbra]
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

[Chorus: Gotye]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

436,I Cry,"[Chorus: Flo Rida & Brenda Russell]
I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
I know you wanna get behind the wheel, but only one Rida
Eyes shut still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go, I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to Japan, quake losers and surviors
Norway no you didn't get my flowers
No way to say it better, but the killer was a Coward
Face just showered, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news, whole day went sour
Lil mama got me feeling like a lemon-head
Put you in the box just as poisonous as cigarettes
Give 'em my regards or regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers, just the young and restless
Gettin' mad cause the quarter million on my necklace
DUI never said I was driving reckless
You and I know that jealously is not impressive
Oh no I can't stop, I was destined

[Chorus: Flo Rida & Brenda Russell]

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
Champagne buckets still got two tears in it
And I put that on my tattoo of Jimi Hendrix
Get the pressed leather outfit all in it
Cuz the press tell it all get a meal ticket
Clean next get a call just a lil visit
Sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid
Reality stressed when you're blessed, just kill critics
Buggatti never meant I'm rich, just God-fearing
Look at me steering, got the bossing staring
Got a good feelin', Mr. Mike Caren
Tell his Billie Jeans, I'm on another planet
Thank E-Class, Big Chuck or Lee Prince Perries
Buy my momma chandeliers on my tears dammit
Thirty years you had thought these emotions vanish
Tryna live tryna figure how my sister vanish
No cheers I know you wouldn't panic

437,Every Storm (Runs Out Of Rain),"[Verse 1]
I saw you standing in the middle of the thunder and lightning
I know you're feeling like you just can't win, but you're trying
It's hard to keep on keeping on when you're being pushed around
Don't even know which way is up
You just keep spinnin' down, 'round down

[Chorus]
Every storm runs, runs out of rain
Just like every dark night turns into day
Every heartache will fade away
Just like every storm runs, runs out of rain

[Verse 2]
So hold your head up and tell yourself
That there's something more
And walk out that door
Go find a new rose
Don't be afraid of the thorns
'Cause we all have thorns
Just put your feet up to the edge
Put your face in the wind
And when you fall back down
Keep on rememberin'

Every storm runs, runs out of rain
Just like every dark night turns into day
Every heartache will fade away
Just like every storm runs, runs out of rain

It's gonna run out of pain
It's gonna run out of sting
It's gonna leave you alone

438,Begin Again,"[Verse 1]
Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels, but I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song but I do, I do
Walked in, expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is, but I do

[Chorus]
And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again

[Verse 2]
You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you, but I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy, but I do

But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did

Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again

[Bridge]
And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk
About the movies that your family watches
Every single Christmas, and I will talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past

'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did

You were raised on an asphalt farm
Ain't never heard a rooster crow
Never walked barefoot by a river
Felt the mud up between your toes

You never rolled in the hay
You never thrown it in four wheel
Climb up on in here girl
Let me show you how country feels

Let your hair down, hair down
Get you some of this laid on back
Kick your shoes off, kick 'em off
Get you some of this slow down fast
I'll take you up and down these hollers and hills
Let me show you how country feels

Never watched the sun go down
From the bed of a pickup truck
Ever been so into somebody
You're still lying there when it comes back up

Girl what do you say?
Cut a path through that cornfield
Park down by the water
Let me show you how country feels

You might be a redneck ...
(radio static)
The Grand Ole Opry coming to you live from ...
(radio static)

[Verse 1]
When your wheelhouse is the land of cotton
The first time you leave it can be strange, it can be shockin'
Not everybody drives a truck, not everybody drinks sweet tea
Not everybody owns a gun, wears a ball cap, boots, and jeans
Not everybody goes to church
Or watches every NASCAR race
Not everybody knows the words to
""Ring Of Fire"" or ""Amazing Grace""

[Chorus]
Oh, Dixie Land
I hope you understand
When I miss my Tennessee home
And I've been away way too long
I can't see this world unless I go
Outside my southern comfort zone

[Verse 2]
I have walked the streets of Rome, I have been to foreign lands
I know what it's like to talk and have nobody understand
I have seen the Eiffel Tower lit up on a Paris night
I have kissed a West Coast girl underneath the Northern Lights
I know what it's like to be the only one like me
To take a good hard look around and be a minority

[Chorus]
And I miss my Tennessee home
I can see the ways that I've grown
I can't see this world unless I go
Outside my southern comfort zone

[Bridge]
I miss your biscuits and your gravy
Fireflies dancing in the night
You have fed me, you have saved me
Billy Graham and Martha White
I have since become a drifter
And I just can't wait to pack
Cause I know the route I leave on
It will always bring me back

I wish I was in Dixie Again

441,She Don't Put It Down,"[Intro: Joe Budden]
Ugh, shorty old news though
Yesterday's paper
Check this!

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
Baby like it raw, I don't even waste a Magnum on her
Clean up amazing, I appreciate the fashion on her
Badder than a motherfuck, ain't too many passin' on her
Only right I pick her up, the way she got a wagon on her
When I'm on that road, don't forget the bops when I'm in town
Not unless it's for the threesome, if it's poppin' she'll be down
Know these other jokers be starin', but it stop when I'm around
Just to get inside them jeans she be hoppin' up and down
Let the world know that she ride
They think that eventually we'll break up
And I love it when we argue, ‘cause eventually we make up
I mean, we fight and fuck, we fuck and fight
We fuck some more, every fuckin' night
Shape great, taste great, body softer than Cashmere
Anytime her cheques drop she knows she can crash here
Them other broads is other broads, all of them is last year
Can't get mad, I'm just stating facts here

[Hook: Tank]
She don't put it down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you
Girl, you working with the killer
Ain’t nobody fuckin' with ya
She don’t put it down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Never trippin' off the past, I would rather never mind 'em
‘Cause only fools trip over somethin' that be behind 'em
And yesterday is history, tomorrow's a mystery
She here at the present time, it feel like a gift when she
Put it down, down, all the way down
You could get down, but can you stay down?
Shout out to the ladies with your down asses
That keep a tight circle and them round asses (Nice!)
At the crib, it's just us, nigga
Fuck me so good, make me not trust niggas
That's my shit, I'm overprotected
You want that good shit? You know where your connect live
Told my ex: ""Don't be bitter, be better.""
I replace her before I regret her
Texts now and then that question how I been
The hook sound like a message I would send

[Hook: Tank]
She don't put it down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you
Girl, you working with the killer
Ain’t nobody fuckin' with ya
She don’t put it down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you

[Verse 3: Twista]
A down girl, I remember when
I used to bag up in the basement with her
With the attraction of a Michael Jackson swag
But in this case a thriller
And she was a wolf, not in sheep's clothing
But a gray chinchilla
Even though I found another assassin
It can never be your replacement killer
When I got up in the goods kinda good to me
But I know that she don't put it down like you
Cut from the bottom when you up
When you pop on top, ‘cause nobody around like you
Pulling back to me and I'm all up in it fully
When I'm pulling a palm full of hair
Finna lay you on your back, missionary position
And give it to you good with your Louboutins in the air
Got a bad new bitch, but she don't be trippin'
Don't cross with them flaws
But she don't be doing the way you be doing it
When you be working them walls
I’m bumpin' some Tank and I'm plankin'
I'm fuckin' her good, but then you go frontin'
Steady cuttin' with bitches all on me
‘Cause I'm with Joe Budden, but what ho wasn't
I'll put you in the category of somebody
That give it to me good but will work a nigga nerves
Individual and I'm never particular
But I'll never be with her, so I kick her to the curb
I got a new woman though
I be building her up to be better than you
She fine, but don't know how to throw it back
So she can never be you

[Bridge: Tank]
I done put another in your space
Damn, after you it’s been hard to replace
I just want the same judge sittin’ on the case
She gon’ hate, but she know

She don't put it down-down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you

442,Crying On A Suitcase,"Boy, don't wait, don't think
Don't lock the door behind you
Run and jump into your truck
And hit the gas, burn some rubber up
Yeah, your time's running out, do it now

Take a shortcut, take a back road
Take the shoulder to the exit
Skip the parking, screw the ticket
Hit the curb and leave it sitting
Whatever it takes, you gotta get to that gate

Sitting at the airport, waiting on the airplane
'Bout to take her out of here

They're gonna call her number
She'll sit down by the window
The plane'll leave the runway
And fade into a goodbye sky

You better run while you've still got time
She's crying on a suitcase

Admit it boy, you blew it, really messed it up
You can make excuses if you really wanna lose her
It's all on the line, do or die time
Getting on your knees time

Tell her that you want her
Need her, love her, gotta have her
Everything good in your life
Begins and ends with her
Lose your pride while you can

443,Let Me Love You (Until You Learn To Love Yourself),"[Verse 1]
Much as you blame yourself, you can't be blamed for the way that you feel
Had no example of a love that was even remotely real
How can you understand something that you never had?
Ooh, baby, if you let me, I can help you out with all of that

[Chorus]
Girl let me love you
And I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl let me love you
And all your trouble
Don't be afraid, girl let me help

Girl let me love you, baby, oh
Girl let me love you
Girl let me love you, baby
Girl let me love you
Let me love you, let me love you, oh

I would like to show you what true love can really do

444,Nothing Like Us,"[Verse 1]
Lately I've been thinking, thinking 'bout what we had
I know it was hard, it was all that we knew, yeah
Have you been drinking to take all the pain away?
I wish that I could give you what you deserve

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause nothing can ever, ever replace you
Nothing can make me feel like you do
You know there’s no one, I can relate to
And know we won’t find a love that’s so true

[Chorus]
There’s nothing like us, there’s nothing like you and me
Together through the storm
There’s nothing like us, there’s nothing like you and me
Together

[Verse 2]
I gave you everything, baby, everything I had to give
Girl, why would you push me away? Yeah
Lost in confusion, like an illusion
You know I'm used to making your day

[Pre-Chorus]
But that is the past now, we didn't last now
I guess that this is meant to be
Tell me was it worth it? We were so perfect
But baby I just want you to see

[Chorus]
There’s nothing like us, there’s nothing like you and me
Together through the storm
There’s nothing like us, there’s nothing like you and me
Together
There’s nothing like us, there’s nothing like you and me
Together through the storm
There’s nothing like us, there’s nothing like you and me

445,Let There Be Cowgirls,"On that very first day, the Lord sat down
And saw fit to say “let there be light!”
So He can tell the day time from the night
And then He spoke again and felt the wind
Come rolling in, smelt the rain
It soaked everything

Then the mountains rose up
Across the great planes
And all the angels up in Heaven started singing
“all it’s missing is a pretty thing”

Let there be cowgirls for every cowboy
Make them strong as any man... Lordy
Something you can’t tame, she’s a Mustang
The heart beat of the heartland
She’s got a drawl yall, yeah
She’s the salt of the earth and rocks my world
Let there be cowgirls, come on

He met me back in ’68
The first time I met her I was nearly eight
And she was ten
Her name was little Kay Lynn
She was born to a farmer who was friends with my father
I was in love with a sharecropper's only daughter
Thought I was in, it made me think again

But when I turned 16
I thought it couldn’t get worse
I saw her riding on a horse and fell in love so bad it hurt

Let there be cowgirls for every cowboy
Make them strong as any man
Something you can’t tame, she’s a Mustang
The heart beat of the heartland
She’s got a drawl yall, yeah
She’s the salt of the earth and rocks my world
Let there be cowgirls, come on

Let there be cowgirls

Let there be cowgirls for every cowboy
Make them strong as any man
Something you can’t tame, she’s a Mustang
The heart beat of the heartland
She’s got a drawl yall, yeah
She’s the salt of the earth and rocks my world

449,Yolo,"[Intro: Andy Samberg & Adam Levine]
YOLO, you only live once
The battle cry of a generation
This life is a precious gift
So don't get too crazy
It's not worth the risk
Yeah

[Chorus 1: Adam Levine]
You know that we are still young
So don't be dumb
Don't trust anyone
'Cause you only live once

[Verse 1: Kiv, Jorm, & Andy]
Uh, you only live once, that's the motto
So take a chill pill, ease off the throttle
Never go to loud clubs 'cause it's bad for your ears
Your friends will all be sorry when they can't hear
And stay the hell away from drugs 'cause they not legal
Then bury all your money in the backyard like a beagle
'Cause you should never trust a bank, they've been known to fail
And never travel by car or bus, boat or by rail
And don't travel by plane, and don't travel at all
Build a bomb shelter basement with titanium walls
And wear titanium suits in case pianos fall on you
And never go to saunas 'cause they're crawlin' with piranhas
And never take the stairs 'cause they're often unsafe
You only live once, don't let it go to waste

[Hook 2: Adam Levine]
You know that we are still young
So hold off on the fun
Cook your meat till it's done
'Cause you only live once

[Verse 2: Kiv, Jorm, & Andy]
Yeah, and here's another piece of advice
Stay away from kids, 'cause their hair is filled with mad lice
There's no such thing as too much Purell
This a cautionary tale, word to George Orwell
So don't 1980-force any plugs into sockets
Always wear a chastity belt and triple lock it
Then hire a taster, make him check your food for poison
And if you think your mailman is a spy, then destroy him
No blankets or pajamas, they can choke you in your sleep
Two words about furniture: killing machines
Now, board your windows up the sun is bad for your health
And always wear a straitjacket so you're safe from yourself

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh huh, take no chances, stop freelancin'
Invest in your future, don't dilute your finances
401K, make sure it's low risk
Then get some real estate (how much?), 4.2%
Thirty year mortgage, that's important, that's a great deal
And if you can't afford it, don't forge it on your last bill
Renting is for suckers right now
A dependable savings
And you'll retire with money in your account
Beast!

[Bridge: All]
YOLO, say no-no
Isolate yourself and just roll solo, be careful-o
You Oughta Look Out also stands for YOLO

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
You know that we are still young
Burn the prints off your thumbs
Then pull out all your teeth
So you can't bite your tongue

[Bridge: All]
Only on this earth for a short time, time
So don't go outside, cause you don't want to die, die
Just take our advice and hide
And scream YOLO to the sky

450,Take A Walk,"[Verse 1]
All these kind of places
Make it seem like it's been ages
And tomorrow some new building will scrape the sky
I love this country dearly
I can feel the ladder clearly
But I never thought I'd be alone to try

Once I was outside Penn Station
Selling red and white carnations
We were still alone
My wife and I
Before we marry, save my money
Brought my dear wife over
Now I work to bring my family stateside

But off the boat they stayed a while
Then scattered across the coast
Once a year I'll see them for a week or so
At most I took a walk

[Hook]
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Practice isn't perfect
But the market cuts a loss
I remind myself that times could be much worse
My wife won't ask me questions
And there's not so much to ask
And she'll never flaunt around an empty purse

Once my mother-in-law came
Just to stay a couple nights
Then decided she would stay the rest of her life
I watch my little children
Play some board game in the kitchen
And I sit and pray they never feel my strife

But then my partner called to say the pension funds were gone
He made some bad investments
Now the accounts are overdrawn
I took a walk

[Hook]
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
Honey it's your son
I think I borrowed just too much
We had taxes, we had bills
We had a lifestyle to front
And tonight I swear I'll come home
And we'll make love like we're young
Tomorrow you'll cook dinner
For the neighbors and their kids
We can rip apart those socialists
And all their damn taxes
You'll see I am no criminal
I'm down on both bad knees
I'm just too much a coward
To admit when I'm in need
I took a walk

[Hook]
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh

When the lights go down
And you're stuck here in this town
With nowhere to go
So you escape through the radio

And you worked all week
To barely make ends meet
Well, I gotta a little cash burning holes in my pocket
Foot on the gas, taking off like a rocket

So come on, come on, baby, I'm buying
I got enough to last us all night and
You got the kiss that tastes like honey
And I got a little beer money
Tonight, tonight, baby, we're drinking

You got the kiss that tastes like honey
And I got a little beer money

We can dance in the dark
Blow the speakers out of this car
Light it up, burn it down
Until the morning rolls around

In a field where we can scream
Get away with almost anything
Yeah, every now and then you gotta raise a little hell
Hope we get lucky and stay out of jail

So come on, come on, baby, I'm buying

So two drinks a night should help me live longer
I blow some smoke just to give my lungs a test
'Cause why tip-toe through life to arrive safely at death?

So if you go fix some drinks me and Usher about to break some rules

Ugh, so he calls me up and he's like, ""I still love you""
And I'm like, ""I just- I mean, this is exhausting, you know?
Like, we are never getting back together, like, ever""

[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever (ooh) getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

[Outro]
We (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, no)
Getting back together
We (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh, oh, yeah)
Getting back together

But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together",Taylor Swift,2013,"[46, 39, 25, 17, 29]",5
462,Thinkin Bout You,"[Verse 1]
A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain in
Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but boy, they pour when

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, ooh no, no, no
I've been thinkin' bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' bout you, do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

[Chorus]
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

[Verse 2]
No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though, I'm lying down

[Pre-Chorus]
Thinkin' 'bout you, ooh no, no, no
I've been thinkin' bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' bout you, do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

[Chorus]
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

[Bridge]
Yes, of course, I remember, how could I forget (How could I forget?) how you feel? (How you feel)
You know you were my first time, a new feel
It won't ever get old, not in my soul, not in my spirit, keep it alive
We'll go down this road 'til it turns from color to black and white

[Chorus]
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh",Frank Ocean,2013,"[49, 45, 46, 45, 40]",5

I thought I'd probably die in prison, expensive taste in women
Ain't had no pot to piss in, now my kitchen full of dishes
Nose bloody from that sniffin', your heroin addiction
Trigger finger itching, fuck parental supervision
This be that murder business, little Timmy got that semi
I ain't kidding, hide your kittens, hit your childrens with that Smith and
A bunch of ignant little niglets, hardheaded, never listen
Purp-purple sippin', finger twistin', teeth glisten like it's Memphis

My Santa Claus was missing, catch you slippin' then it's Christmas
Motherfuck a wishlist, my ghetto was ambition
For my Benjis and my Bentley
And them bitches now I gets-gets

Choking on that biscuit 'til I'm no longer existing
I wonder if they miss me, as long as I make history
Now my soul is feeling empty, tell the reaper come and get me

Niggas talking down
Never talk to cops
Make him talk to God when I tote that 9, he ain't talking now

Better guide your track, better not look back
Now stay in line, don't step on cracks
So you break her back, I'm talking 'bout your mom (Uh)
Cause there's killers in my town (Uh)
Making hits, sniffing lines (Yeah)
Out committing crimes (Yeah)
Wait for shit to simmer down (Uh)
Corrupted little minds (Yeah)

Diced pineapple
Tonight you shall reach a height that the sky won't catch you
The highest form of my admiration
I ain't no connoisseur but I'm, kinda sure you will admire my taste
And before the sun graze ya, I'm tryin to see how deep you are
And believe me shorty I ain't talking 'bout no intimate conversation
I wanna see if I can make you reach things unobtainable
When I peek into your nature
And I promise you my goals will exceed any physical pleasure
I wanna, give you what's better than better
The better my effort, the wetter her treasure
The more these mere moments seem like heavens or, temporary forevers
Shorty get it together, hah, diced pineapple
May your love come down so my mind might have you
You designed my imagination
Let me redefine foreplay 'til you need five and
Tell me shorty you got it baby
If it's not it baby, hope it's progress baby
Let it all drip baby
If you stop that shaking, no more talking baby
No more talking baby

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Shorty so fine, pussy so fresh
Diced pineapples, damn, my baby tastes the best
I nearly lost my mind, guess it was a test
Swept her off her feet and went and bought her ass a Lex
Paid it off cash so I never wrote a check
Leave my cars at her crib, I'm just stuntin' on her ex
Pussy's excellent and I know it sound a mess
I love to make her toes curl as I'm lickin' on her flesh (ugh)
Sex all night, couple shots of CÎROC
Crib on the water, got LeBron up the block
Money ain't the thing, baby, welcome to the mob
Diced pineapples, talking diamonds by the jar
Bitch so bad got me wishing I could sing
Her uniform Isabel Marant when you on the team
Double MG, them other niggas fell off
Baby girl, I just wanna see you well off

[Chorus: Drake]
Call me crazy, shit at least you’re calling
Feels better when you let it out, don't it girl?
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right, aww yeah

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Shorty so fine, pussy so fresh
Diced pineapples, I just bought my girl a set
I know my lifestyle wild, I do it for the set
She know how to make me smile and she do it with the sex
Pop bottles, make love, Thug Passion
Red bottoms, Moncler, high fashion
Belt buckles, door handles, gold plated
Balmain, rich denim, out Vegas
French Riviera, baby girl lets take a trip
I'ma trip go to Cannes, France to catch a flick
Baby listen, this position is a blessing
And with your permission, hopefully you'll learn a lesson (ugh)

She never wrote a song but I know that she's a star

Something about her, probably can't live without her
Roll up some sour, let me kiss on her fountain
Mission accomplished, you increasing your heart rate
And I won't ever rest, we meet at the peak of your mountain
Eager to show you, thinking that I should know you
And you eager to work perfect, I can employ you
Designer shit spoil you, rub you down with the oil
To get on a higher tree, gonna have to climb a sequoia
Hol' up, showing off some Agent Provocateur
Rushing you out your drawers though patiently get you off
Hate when they be too anxious though, hate when they be too dull
Like to go deep but I hate to get too deeply involved
How sweet is you? (sweet is you?) Let me see some proof
Fuck making pussy talk, I like to make it sing a tune
All we need is we, we don’t need no room
Right now I’m trying to eat, and we don’t need a spoon

Call me crazy, shit at least you’re calling

467,Between The Raindrops,"A shadow crossed the blue Miami sky
As we hit the causeway by the big hotel
We fought
Now I can't remember why
After all the words were said and tears were gone
We vowed we'd never say goodbye

When we kissed we could hear the sound of thunder
As we watched the regulars rush the big hotels
We kissed again as the showers swept the Florida shore
You opened your umbrella
But we walked between the raindrops back to your door

In my dreams I can hear the sound of thunder
I can see the causeway by the big hotels
That happy day we'll find each other on that Florida shore
You'll open your umbrella
And we'll walk between the raindrops back to your door...",Donald Fagen,2013,[100],1

It's been a long time coming since I've seen your face
I've been everywhere and back trying to replace
Everything that I had 'til my feet went numb
Prayin' like a fool that's been on the run
Heart's still beating, but it's not working
It's like a million-dollar phone that you just can't ring
I reached out trying to love, but I feel nothing
Yeah, my heart is numb

But with you
I feel again
Yeah, with you
I can feel again

A long time coming since I've seen your face
I've been everywhere and back trying to replace
Everything that I broke 'til my feet went numb
Praying like a fool who just shot a gun
Heart still beating, but it's not working

469,The Moment I Knew,"[Verse 1]
You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that ""Baby, I'm right here"" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I would've been so happy

[Verse 2]
Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here

[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

[Verse 3]
And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
""He said he'd be here""

[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing (missing)
And that was the moment I knew

[Bridge]
What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?

[Breakdown]
You should've been here
And I would've been so happy

[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standing around me, singing
""Happy birthday to you""
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

You called me later
And said, ""I'm sorry I didn't make it""
And I said, ""I'm sorry, too""

470,I Dreamed A Dream,"I dreamed a dream in time gone by
When hope was high and life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving

I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung, no wine untasted

But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hope apart
As they tear your dreams to shame

She slept a summer by my side
And filled my days with endless wonder
She took my childhood in her stride
But she was gone when autumn came

And still I dream she’ll come to me
And we will spend the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
There are storms we cannot weather

I had a dream my life would be
So different from this hell I’m living
So different now than what it seemed
Now life has killed the dream I dreamed",Darren Criss,2013,"[93, 74, 69]",3
471,Ready Or Not,"[Chorus: Lauryn Hill]
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Now that I escape, sleepwalker awake
Those who could relate know the world ain't cake
Jail bars ain't golden gates, those who fake, they break
When they meet their 400-pound mate
If I could rule the world, everyone would have a gun
In the ghetto of course, when giddyuping on their horse
I kick a rhyme drinking moonshine
I pour a sip on the concrete, for the deceased
But, no, don't weep, Wyclef's in a state of sleep
Thinking 'bout the robbery that I did last week
Money in the bag, banker looked like a drag
I want to play with pelicans from here to Baghdad
Gun blast, think fast, I think I'm hit
My girl pinched my hips to see if I still exist
I think not, I'll send a letter to my friends
A born again hooligan only to be king again

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill]
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me

[Verse 2: Lauryn Hill]
I play my enemies like a game of chess
Where I rest, no stress, if you don't smoke sess
Lest I must confess, my destiny's manifest
In some Goretex and sweats, I make tracks like I'm homeless
Rap orgies with Porgy and Bess
Capture your bounty, like Elliot Ness, yes
Bless you if you represent the Fu
But I'll hex you with some witch's brew if you're doo-doo
Voodoo; I can do what you do, easy
Believe me, fronting niggas give me heebie-jeebies
So while you're imitating Al Capone
I'll be Nina Simone and defecating on your microphone

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill]
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and take it slowly

[Bridge: Lauryn Hill]
You can't run away from these scars I got
Oh, baby, hey, baby, ‘cause I got a lot, oh, yeah
And anywhere you go, my whole crew gonna know
Oh baby, hey baby, you can't hide from the block, oh no

[Verse 3: Pras with Lauryn Hill]
Ready or not, refugees taking over
The Buffalo Soldier, dreadlock Rasta
On the twelfth hour, fly by in my bomber
Crews run for cover, now they're under, pushing up flowers
Superfly, true lies, do or die (He's super fly!)
Toss me high, only puff lye with my crew from Lakay
I refugee from Guantanamo Bay
Dance around the border, like I'm Cassius Clay (Yes, sir)

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill (Wyclef)]
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide (Ay, yo nobody move)
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide (Ay, yo nobody move)
Gonna find you and make you want me (Come on)

Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide (You know the)
Gonna find you and take it slowly
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and make you want me",Fugees,2013,"[97, 75, 49, 94]",4

473,Blow Me (One Last Kiss),"[Verse 1]
White knuckles
And sweaty palms from hanging on too tight
Clenched shut jaw
I've got another headache again tonight
Eyes on fire, eyes on fire
And they burn from all the tears
I've been crying, I've been crying
I've been dying over you
Tie a knot in the rope
Tryna hold, tryna to hold
But there's nothing to grasp so
I let go

[Chorus]
I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
Have you had a shit day?
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

[Verse 2]
I won't miss
All of the fighting that we always did
Take it in
I mean what I say when I say there is nothing left
No more sick
Whiskey dick
No more battles for me
You'll be calling a trick
Cause you no longer sleep
I'll dress nice
I'll look good
I'll go dancing alone
I will laugh
I'll get drunk
I'll take somebody home

[Chorus]
I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
Have you had a shit day?
We've had a shit day

Blow me one last kiss
Blow me one last kiss

[Bridge]
I will do what I please
Anything that I want

You will pay for your sins
You'll be sorry, my dear
All the lies, all the ""why's"" will be crystal clear

I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us

She fuck with solid niggas (ayy)
She don't be fuckin' with broke boys, I ran it up, that was my choice
She call me up when she need pipe, my girl ain't playin' with no toys

I been hanging round this place, I been looking through your space
I been waiting' for you, I've been waiting' for you
All the places that you go, all the people that you know
I've been looking for you, I've been looking for you

[Verse 2]
And all these pretty people up on El Cerrito Place
They all got something in their pockets, all got something on their face
They roll down to La Brea where it meets the boulevard
Singing' hallelujah while they dance over the stars
They all say they're going' far

Me I've been looking for you baby, I've been looking for you baby
I've been looking for you baby, I've been looking for you baby
All night long, all night long, all night long

Someone said they might have seen you where the ocean meets the land
So I've been out here all night looking for your footprints in the sand
Did you hear the ocean singing, baby did you sing along
While you danced out in the water to some ol' forgotten song
Were you even here at all?

[Chorus]
Me I've been looking for you baby, I've been looking for you baby
I've been looking for you baby, I've been looking for you baby
All night long, all night long, all night long

[Verse 4]
Somehow I wound up in the desert just after daylight
Where the Joshua Trees grow that little place you always liked
These pioneer town people ain't got too much to say
And if you ever were here baby they ain't giving' you away

[Verse 5]
Now it's been two days
I'm still looking for you baby, I've been looking for you baby
I've been looking for you baby, I've been looking for you baby
All night long, all night long, all night long

479,Did It For The Girl,"I got the Chevy all shined up
Paid a little more for a hair cut
Ironed up a pearl snap, left that old ball cap
Gave myself a little extra smell good splash

I did it for the girl dancin' in the sunset
Get to see her sippin' on Corona, little silhouette
Did it for the moonlight, slow ride, slidin' over by my side
Been waiting on that all night kiss, I did it for the girl

I dialed her up some more George Strait
Me and old George sang Marina Del Rey
There by the water's edge, big sky turnin' red
That perfect night, she said she can't forget

I did it for the girl dancin' in the sunset
Get to see her sippin' on Corona, little silhouette
Did it for the moonlight, slow ride, slidin' over by my side
Been waiting on that all night kiss, I did it for the girl

I did it for that long hair, fallin' down, layin' on her shoulders
Those blue eyes want me to hold her

I did it for the girl dancin' in the sunset
Get to see her sippin' on Corona, little silhouette
Did it for the moonlight, slow ride, slidin' over by my side
Been waiting on that all night kiss

I did it for the girl dancin' on the front porch
Reachin' out to grab my shirt, pull me through the front door
Did it for the midnight, candlelight

480,On My Own,"[Verse 1]
Remember sitting on the bench wearing the same clothes
They used to call me ugly, had a Blackberry with no hoes
Now she calling on my iPhone, rose gold
Bitch I'm in LA for two days, then I'm going home
I don't want to see your panties now, I just wanted dome
Driving down Santa Monica with a Asian ting
Wonder what this fame will bring
Gucci belts and diamond rings
I hope this shit don't change me
My best friends started hating me
Girlfriend moving shady, she can't trust me now
I'm standing on the ground but Xanny's got me in the clouds
Things are looking up, I still remember looking down
The labels call me up but I'ma always shut 'em down

[Chorus]
Cause I did this on my own, did this on my own yeah
I don't need no help, I rather do it by myself
Because I did this on my own, did this on my own yeah
Don't ask me something, I don't owe you nothing
Did this on my own, I did this on my own yeah
I did this on my own yeah, did this on my own
You can't tell me nothing

[Verse 2]
Heard someone say NAV is done, I'm just getting started
They said I wouldn't make it probably because of my image
Coach put me in the game
These fuckboys still playing scrimmage
Just bought the foreign with no tints
Want you to see when I'm in it
Start something for me and best believe you'll be finished
My momma called me for a hour, ain't been home in a minute
I won't drink that Sprite without Promethazine in it
I just bought some water and a Molly came wit it
Once you get a little money, lots of problems come with it
I got my city speculating, cause there's owls on my linen
They gon' ditch you when you're losing
Then come back when you're winning
That's why I can't trust nobody, knew it from the beginning

[Chorus]
That's why I did this on my own, did this on my own yeah
I don't need no help, I rather do it by myself
Because I did this on my own, did this on my own yeah
Don't ask me something, I don't owe you nothing
Did this on my own, I did this on my own yeah
I did this on my own yeah, did this on my own

481,Ice,"[Produced by Dr. Dre & DJ Yella]

[Intro: The D.O.C., Dr. Dre, and Ice Cube]
Right about now, N.W.A. court is in full effect
Judge Dre presiding
In the case of N.W.A. versus the Police Department
Prosecuting attorneys are; MC Ren, Ice Cube
And Eazy-motherfucking-E
Order, order, order!
Ice Cube, take the motherfucking stand
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
And nothing but the truth so help your black ass?
You goddamn right!
Well, won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Fuck the police! Comin' straight from the underground
A young nigga got it bad ‘cause I'm brown
And not the other color, so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
Fuck that shit ‘cause I ain't the one
For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
To be beating on and thrown in jail
We can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin' with me ‘cause I'm a teenager
With a little bit of gold and a pager
Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product
Thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics
You'd rather see me in the pen
Than me and Lorenzo rollin' in a Benz-o
Beat a police out of shape
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still getting swole off bread and water
I don't know if they fags or what
Search a nigga down, and grabbing his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun, they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
‘Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top
Black police showing out for the white cop
Ice Cube will swarm
On any motherfucker in a blue uniform
Just ‘cause I'm from the CPT
Punk police are afraid of me
Huh, a young nigga on the warpath
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops, dying in L.A
Yo, Dre, I got something to say

[Chorus]
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!

[Skit 1: Cop, MC Ren, & Dr. Dre]
Pull your goddamn ass over right now!
Aww shit, now, what the fuck you pullin' me over for?
‘Cause I feel like it!
Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up!
Man, fuck this shit!
A'ight, smartass, I'm taking your black ass to jail!
MC Ren, will you please give your testimony
To the jury about this fucked up incident?

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
Fuck the police! And Ren said it with authority
Because the niggas on the street is a majority
A gang is with whoever I'm steppin'
And the motherfuckin' weapon is kept in
A stash box, for the so-called law
Wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw
Lights start flashing behind me
But they're scared of a nigga, so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
Because it gives them a hint not to step in my path
For police, I'm saying, ""Fuck you, punk!""
Reading my rights and shit, it's all junk
Pulling out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so you can see what's up
And we'll go at it, punk, and I'ma fuck you up!
Make you think I'ma kick your ass
But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast
I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
But I'ma smoke them now and not next time
Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
Or any asshole that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
Taking out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
The motherfuckin' villain that's mad
With potential to get bad as fuck
So I'ma turn it around
Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound
(Gunshot sounds)
Yeah, somethin' like that
But it all depends on the size of the gat
Taking out a police would make my day
But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say…

[Chorus]
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!

[Skit 2: Cop, Eazy-E, and Dr. Dre]
(Knocking sounds)
Yeah, man, what you need?
Police, open out!
Aww, shit
We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest
Get down and put your hands right where I can see 'em!
(Move, motherfucker, move now!)
What the fuck did I do, man? What did I do?
Just shut the fuck up
And get your motherfucking ass on the floor!
(You heard the man, shut the fuck up!)
But I didn't do shit
Man, just shut the fuck up!
Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand
And tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?

[Verse 3: Eazy-E & MC Ren]
I'm tired of the motherfuckin' jackin'
Sweating my gang, while I'm chillin' in the shack, and
Shining the light in my face, and for what?
Maybe it's because I kick so much butt
I kick ass, or maybe ‘cause I blast
On a stupid ass nigga when I'm playing with the trigger
Of an Uzi or an AK
‘Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say
They put out my picture with silence
‘Cause my identity by itself causes violence
The E with the criminal behavior
Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do you got?
A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot
By me, or another nigga
And with a gat, it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger
(Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school, fool!)
And as you all know, E's here to rule
Whenever I'm rollin', keep lookin' in the mirror
And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb motherfucker with a gun
And if I'm rollin' off the 8, he'll be the one
That I take out, and then get away
While I'm driving off laughing, this is what I'll say

[Chorus]
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!
Fuck tha police!

[Skit 3: Dr. Dre, Cop]
The verdict:
The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck
White bread, chickenshit motherfucker
Wait, that's a lie! That's a goddamn lie!
Get him out of here!
I want justice!
Get him the fuck out my face!
I want justice!
Out, right now!
Fuck you, you black motherfuckers!

I can’t decide
What if life’s a lie?

You doubt him, don't know a damn thing about him

Go, all day every day, hold on with all might

Juste un clou, while I coast through clouds
That's my life babe, crystal clear, no cascade
I'm going, going I'm on a crusade
To save the kids from the weak shit
It's finally gonna be my world
Here all the girls can be my girls
Just sit back count stacks girl
Hold a nigga down all the time girl

[Chorus]
I can’t decide
What if life’s a lie?
I push the lames aside
They’ll learn
I can never front, know why?

We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead

Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof

Never planned that one day I'd be losing you

Saw you downtown, singing the blues
