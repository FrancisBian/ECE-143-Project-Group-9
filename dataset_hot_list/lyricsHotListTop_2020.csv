You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled at so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with the missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of Vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a

If you never gave a damn, raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on a chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face on my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't want to hurt 'em, but I did 'em in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade him
Finna kill 'em and dump all the fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me out of me
You don't want to be the enemy of the demon who went in me
And be on the receiving end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full

I trap until the bloody bottoms is underneath

I was broke, now I'm rich, these niggas salty

Straight up out the Yajects, I'm a big Crip

But I got rich on all these niggas, I didn't forget, back
I had to go through the struggle, I didn't forget that
I hopped inside of the Maybach and now I can sit back
These bitches know me now 'cause I got them big racks
'Cause I'm gettin' money now, I know you heard that
Young nigga on the corner, bitch, I had to serve crack
Uncle fronted me some P's, had to get them birds back
We came up on dirty money, I gave it a birdbath
Cut off the brain and I give my bitch a new coupe

It's like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio, you're
Right back on it, reminding me all over again
How you fucking just brushed me off and left me so burnt
Spent a lot of time tryin' to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I'm coming for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed, for
The way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over? You could just close the
Chapter and go about your life like it was nothing?
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doin' fine
Well, I've never recovered
But tonight I bet you that what you're
'Bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges? Mind saying, ""Let it go, fuck this.""
Heart's saying, ""I will, once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset.""

I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time

And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?
Not this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch!
Finish this stitch, so you can reap what you sew, nitwit
Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget it!
You left our family in shambles
And you expect me to just get over him, pretend he never existed?
May be gone but he's not forgotten
And don't think ‘cause he's been out the pictures
So long that I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't comin' to get ya
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him, same shit you did to me, cold
Have you any idea the shit that I've gone through?
Feelings I harbor? All this pent-up resentment I hold on to?
Not once you call to ask me how I'm doin'
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And, gee, who better to talk to than you?
The cause of my problems
My life is garbage, and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Poof, then I'm gone, voosh

I've been drivin' around your side of this town
Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment
To come and see ya, but I ain't here for your empathy
I don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy
It's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully, and treat your bedroom window
Like I reached my full potential: I peeked
Continue to peep, still bent low, then keep
Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo, sneak
All the way 'round to the back porch
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders beforehand?
Surprised to see me? Cat caught your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag, dag, almost hack-up a lung
Like you picked an axe up and swung, stick to the core plan
Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans
Irony's spectacular, huh? Now who's a faggot, you punk?
And here's your Bronco hat
You can have that shit back ‘cause they suck
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim, I hope you hear it
We're in the car right now – wait, here comes my favorite lyric
""I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die""
And hey, here's a sequel to my
Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy
How's this for a publicity stunt? This should be fun!
Last album now, ‘cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by M and M, Matthew Mitchell
Bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Since you're in love with your city so much, I figured, what the fuck
The best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, time is quite near
Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea, as cops appear in my driver's side mirror
(Oh, God! Police! Aaaghh!)
Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least
New plan, Stan!
Slim: ""Chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car""
Well, gotta go, almost at the bridge
Ha ha, big bro, it's for you; Slim, this is for him
And Frank Ocean; oh, hope you can swim good
Now say you hate homos again!

I also represent
Anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Nope, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approachin' its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds
Toilets clogged, yeah, ‘cause I'm talking a lot of
Shit but I'm backing it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers
After the track is demolished, I am your lack of a conscience
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eatin' your vocal chords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water
But I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you, every woman you insult
Batter, but the double-standards you have
When it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
‘Cause Marshall Mathers, the rapper's persona
Is half a facade, and Matthew and Stan's just symbolic
Of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone
‘Cause after all the glitz and the glam
No more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off, sad, but it happens to all of them
I'm the hindsight to say, “I told you so!”
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don't stop after they call ya
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
When it's time to walk away, I'm every guilt trip
The baggage you have, but as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
'Less it makes an impact, then don't bother
So 'fore you rest your case
Better make sure you're packin' a wallop
So, one last time, I'm back
Before it fades into black and it's all over
Behold the final chapter in a saga
Tryin' to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice, the magic that started
It all, tragic portrait of an artist
Tortured, trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts blacker and darker
Than anything imaginable; here goes a wild stab in the dark

[Chorus]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

[Verse 1]
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin' with you?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge

[Refrain]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this

[Chorus]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

[Verse 2]
I'm tryin' to keep it alive
And not compromise the feeling we love
You're tryin' to keep it deprived
And only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror
I know what you scared of
The feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name
I'll let the people know this is somethin' you can blame
On yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I'ma break out and then hide every lock

[Refrain]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me

Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
You ain't heard the coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings
Now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music
I say bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

We've been looking for love in a world full of hate
Tell me what's it take, to find somebody true
Find somebody real, I don't need the fake
And I don't need the lies, but the truth hurts
Now a days I need proof first
I told her:
""Baby we can fall in love but just make sure you love you first""
I'm done falling for the wrong ones
I need someone for the long-run
I need someone that I know is down to ride for me when this shit is all done

Told me that she always had it for me
I never thought falling for someone would happen to me but

Never thought that shit would ever happen to me

Never thought that shit would ever happen to me
I don't want nobody else but you girl tell me is you down to make it happen with me

When is love, not lust you gon' feel the difference
Stay close when you feel the distance
And all the times you thought you found love
You would still feel something's missing
I'm riding with you in the rain
You know I'm with you through the pain
I knew you needed something different
Until you met me, all these niggas was the same
But girl you be driving me crazy
Rather be driving Mercedes
I know there's been times that you hate me
But can nobody else replace me?
Baby tell me can I talk to you?
All these girls I cut them off for you
Your time, love and your persistance, all a nigga needed
All a nigga want from you
And no one's ever gonna change that
Me and you can take it way back
You give a certain type of love to me
What I feel I can never replace that
She gave her love and her passion to me
Told me that she always had it for me
I never thought falling for someone would happen to me but

[Chorus]
You was all that ever mattered to me
I never thought I'd fall in love, girl
Never thought that shit would ever happen to me
If I had to tell the truth girl
Really you was all that ever mattered to me

To all the people that lived above the buildings that I was hustlin' in front of
Called the police on me when I was just tryin' to make some money to feed my daughter (it's all good)
And all the niggas in the struggle
You know what I'm sayin'? It's all good, baby baby

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed in Bambú, sippin' on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number, same hood, it's all good

I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach
And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
The Moët and Alizé keep me pissy, girls used to diss me
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rapping stuff
I was too used to packing gats and stuff
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the East Coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Living life without fear
Puttin' five karats in my baby girl ear
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

You know very well (C'mon)
Who you are (Bankrolls)
Don't let 'em hold you down (Clothes)

And my whole crew is loungin'
Celebrating every day, no more public housin'
Thinkin' back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps an Ac' with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip Champagne when we thirsty
Uh, damn right I like the life I live
'Cause I went from negative to positive and it's all (It's all good, nigga)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

Ayy, Panini, don't you be a meanie
Thought you wanted me to go up
Why you tryna keep me teeny? I
It's a dream, he wished it on a genie
I got fans finally, ain't you wanting them to see me? I

I thought you want this for my life, for my life
Said you wanted to see me thrive, you lied

[Chorus]
Just say to me what you want from me
Just say to me what you want from me

[Verse 2]
Ayy, Panini, don't you be a meanie
Thought you wanted me to go up
Why you tryna keep me teeny now?
Now they need me, number one on streaming
Oh yeah, you used to love me
So what happened, what's the meaning? I

I thought you want this for my life, for my life
Said you wanted to see me thrive, you lied

Now when it's all done, I get the upper hand

I'ma need to sit down, don't mean to make demands

49,South Of The Border,"South of the border, down Mexico way
That's where I fell in love when the stars above came out to play
And now as I wander, my thoughts ever stray
South of the border, down Mexico way

She was a picture in old Spanish lace
Just for a tender while, I kissed the smile apon her face
Cause it was fiesta and we were so gay
South of the border... Mexico way

Then she sighed as she whispered ""manana""
Never dreaming that we were parting
And I lied as a whispered ""manana""
Cause our tomorrow never came

South of the border, I jumped back one day
There in a veil of white by the candle light she knelt to pray
The mission bells told me that I mustn't stay
South of the border... Mexico way

The mission bells told me (ding-dong) that I must not stay
Stay south of the border, down Mexico way",Frank Sinatra,2020,"[50, 56, 56, 61, 72, 100]",6

53,Good News,"[Verse 1]
I spent the whole day in my head
Do a little spring cleanin'
I'm always too busy dreamin'
Well, maybe I should wake up instead
A lot of things I regret, but I just say I forget
Why can't it just be easy?
Why does everybody need me to stay?
Oh, I hate the feeling
When you're high but you're underneath the ceiling
Got the cards in my hand, I hate dealing, yeah
Get everything I need then I'm gone, but it ain't stealing
Can I get a break?
I wish that I could just get out my goddamn way
What is there to say?
There ain't a better time than today
But maybe I'll lay down for a little, yeah
Instead of always trying to figure everything out
And all I do is say sorry
Half the time I don't even know what I'm saying it about

[Chorus]
Good news, good news, good news
That's all they wanna hear
No, they don't like it when I'm down
But when I'm flying, oh
It make 'em so uncomfortable
So different, what's the difference?

[Verse 2]
Well, it ain't that bad
It could always be worse
I'm running out of gas, hardly anything left
Hope I make it home from work
Well, so tired of being so tired
Why I gotta build something beautiful just to go set it on fire?
I'm no liar, but
Sometimes the truth don't sound like the truth
Maybe 'cause it ain't
I just love the way it sound when I say it
Yeah, it's what I do
If you know me, it ain't anything new
Wake up to the moon, haven't seen the sun in a while
But I heard that the sky's still blue, yeah
I heard they don't talk about me too much no more
And that's a problem with a closed door

[Chorus]
Good news, good news, good news
That's all they wanna hear
No, they don't like it when I'm down
But when I'm flying, oh
It make 'em so uncomfortable
So different, what's the difference?

[Verse 3]
There's a whole lot more for me waitin' on the other side
I'm always wonderin' if it feel like summer
I know maybe I'm too late, I could make it there some other time
I'll finally discover
That there's a whole lot more for me waitin'
That there's a whole lot more for me waitin'
I know maybe I'm too late, I could make it there some other time
Then I'll finally discover
That it ain't that bad, ain't so bad
Well, it ain't that bad, mm
At least it don't gotta be no more

Heart been broke so many times I don't know what to believe
Mama say it’s my fault, it's my fault, I wear my heart on my sleeve
Think it's best I put my heart on ice, heart on ice ’cause I can't breathe
I'ma put my heart on ice, heart on ice, it's gettin' the best of me

[Verse]
While in the cell with Lil' Hakeem, after I slapped him I had told him
“I don't know how you get down with them clowns but I'm a soldier”
No one could understand, I had way too much aggression
That built over the years from my abandoned adolescence
See I done been lied to, backstabbed, and heartbroken
I wanted to cry but I was too afraid to open
Prayin’ one day I’d find a peace of mind by the ocean
I spent all my time committing crimes to get closer
While at my nana house I play the couch, starin' at the ceiling
Tryin’ not to get in my feelings
Thinkin' of a way I could make these millions
Maybe that'll take this pain away and clear up all these rainy days, yeah

[Chorus]
Heart been broke so many times I don't know what to believe
Mama say it’s my fault, it's my fault, I wear my heart on my sleeve

I hit a curb just to make you slide
The only light is a flashing yellow
The only thing that I want is your kiss
I'm lovin' nothin' to do with you, baby
Just ridin' roads on a night like this (Oh)

[Post-Chorus]
Just ridin' roads on a night like this (Oh)
Ridin' roads",Dustin Lynch,2020,"[67, 60, 52, 47, 51, 73]",6
67,More Hearts Than Mine,"[Verse 1]
I can't wait to show you where I grew up
Walk you 'round the foothills of my town
Probably feel like you've been there before
After hearing all the stories I've been telling you
For 6 months now

We'll probably have to sleep in separate bedrooms
Pack a shirt for church because we'll go
I'm not trying to scare you off but
I just thought that we should talk a few things out
Before we hit the road

[Chorus]
If I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She falls in love a little faster than I do
And my dad will check your tires
Pour you whiskey over ice and
Take you fishing but pretend that he don't like you
Oh, if we break up, I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine

[Verse 2]
My sister's gonna ask a million questions
Say anything she can to turn you red
And when you meet my high school friends
They'll buy you drinks and fill you in
On all the crazy nights I can't outlive

[Chorus]
So if I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She falls in love a little faster than I do
And my dad will check your tires
Pour you whiskey over ice and
Buy you dinner but pretend that he don't like you
Oh, if we break up, I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
If I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She feels every heartache I go through
And if my dad sees me crying
He'll pour some whiskey over ice and
Tell a lie and say he never really liked you
Oh, if we break up, I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine
You'll be breaking more hearts than mine",Ingrid Andress,2020,"[68, 86, 76, 82, 88]",5
68,SUGAR,"[Hook 1: Wonder Mike]
I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop and you don't stop
The rock it to the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

[Verse 1: Wonder Mike]
Now, what you hear is not a test, I'm rapping to the beat
And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet
See I am Wonder Mike and I'd like to say ""hello""
To the black, to the white, the red and the brown, the purple and yellow
But first, I gotta bang bang the boogie to the boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie
Let's rock, you don't stop
Rock the rhythm that'll make your body rock
Well so far you've heard my voice, but I brought two friends along
And next on the mic is my man Hank; come on, Hank, sing that song

[Verse 2: Big Bank Hank]
Check it out, I'm the C-A-S-AN, the O-V-A and the rest is F-L-Y
You see, I go by the code of the doctor of the mix and these reasons I'll tell you why
You see I'm six foot one and I'm tons of fun and I dress to a tee
You see I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali and I dress so viciously
I got bodyguards, I got two big cars, that definitely ain't the whack
I got a Lincoln continental and a sunroof Cadillac
So after school, I take a dip in the pool, which is really on the wall
I got a color TV so I can see the Knicks play basketball
Hear me talking 'bout checkbooks, credit cards, more money than a sucker could ever spend
But I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum from the Rucker, not a dime 'til I made it again

[Hook 2: Big Bank Hank]
Everybody go: Hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today (say what?)
Cause I'ma get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go: Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
You see, if your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend

[Post-Hook: Big Bank Hank]
Uh Master Gee, my mellow?
It's on you so what you gonna do?

[Verse 3: Master Gee]
Well it's on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
I said a M-A-S, a T-E-R, a G with a double E
I said I go by the unforgettable name of the man they call the Master Gee
Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and the pretty girls
I'm going down in history
As the baddest rapper there ever could be
Now I'm feeling the highs and you're feeling the lows
The beat starts getting into your toes
You start popping your fingers and stomping your feet
And moving your body while you're sitting in your seat
And then damn, you start doing the freak
I said damn, right outta your seat
Then you throw your hands high in the air
You're rocking to the rhythm, shake your derriere
You're rocking to the beat without a care
With the sure-shot emcees for the affair
Now, I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same
I got a little face and a pair of brown eyes
All I'm here to do ladies is hypnotize
Singing on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singing on and on and on, on and on
Like a hot ready to pop the pop the pop dibbie dibbie
Pop the pop, pop, you don't dare stop
Come alive y'all gimme what you got
I guess by now you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's okay, I still keep in stride
Cause all I'm here to do is just wiggle your behind
Singing on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
Singing on and on and on, on and on
Rock rock y'all get on the floor

[Hook 3: Master Gee]
I'm gonna freak ya here I'm gonna freak you there
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere

[Post-Hook: Master Gee]
Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind
I'll put t-t-tickets in your behind
I said 1-2-3-4, come on, girls, get on the floor
Uh, come alive, y'all gimme what ya got
Cause I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said 1-2-3-4, tell me Wonder Mike what are you waiting for?

[Hook 1: Wonder Mike]
I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop and you don't stop

Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

[Verse 4: Wonder Mike]
Skiddlee beebop a we rock a scooby doo
And guess what, America: we love you
Cause ya rock and ya roll with so much soul
You could rock 'til you're a hundred and one years old
I don't mean to brag I don't mean to boast
But we like hot butter on a breakfast toast
Rock it up, uh, baby bubbah
Baby bubbah to the boogie the bang bang the boogie
To the beat beat, it's so unique
Come on, everybody, and dance to the beat

[Bridge: Intro sound: 16 measures]

[Hook 1: Wonder Mike]
I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop and you don't stop
The rock it to the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

[Verse 5: Wonder Mike]
I said I can't wait 'til the end of the week
When I'm rapping to the rhythm of a groovy beat
An attempt to raise your body heat
Just blow your mind so that you can't speak
To do a thing but a rock and shuffle your feet
And let it change up to a dance called the freak
And when ya finally do come into your rhythmic beat
Rest a little while so ya don't get weak
I know a man named Hank
He has more rhymes than a serious bank
So come on Hank, uh, sing that song
To the rhythm of the boogie the bang bang the bong

[Verse 6: Big Bank Hank]
Well, I'm Imp the Dimp the ladies pimp
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside, into the front
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker emcees try to prove a point
We're treacherous trio, uh, with a serious joint
A from sun to sun and from day to day
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mic til you can't resist
Everybody, I say it goes like this
Well I was coming home late one dark afternoon
Reporter stopped me for a interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntables
This young reporter I did adore
So I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before
She said ""damn fly guy I'm in love with you""
The Casanova legend must have been true
I said by the way baby what's your name
Said ""I go by the name of Lois Lane""
And you could be my boyfriend you surely can
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman
I said he's a fairy I do suppose
Flying through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy or even cute
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit
I said you need a man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night
But can he rock a party 'til the early light
He can't satisfy you with his little worm
But I can bust you out with my super sperm
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it
An I'm here and I'm there I'm Big Bank Hank, I'm everywhere
Just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it, uh, don't stop y'all, uh, tick a tock y'all you don't stop

[Hook 2: Big Bank Hank]
I go: Hotel, motel, what you gonna do today (say what)
I'm gonna get a fly girl gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go: Hotel, motel, holiday inn
You see, if your girl starts acting up then you take her friend

[Post-Hook: Big Bank Hank]
I say skip, dive, what can I say
I can't fit em all inside my OJ
So I just take half and bust them out
I give the rest to Master Gee so he could shock the house

[Verse 7: Master Gee]
It was 12 o'clock one Friday night
I was rocking to the beat and feeling all right
Everybody was dancing on the floor
Doing all the things they never did before
And then this fly fly girl with a sexy lean
She came into the bar, she came into the scene
As she traveled deeper inside the room
All the fellas checked out her white Sassons
She came up to the table, looked into my eyes
Then she turned around and shook her behind
So I said to myself, its time for me to release
My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece
And now people in the house this is just for you
A little rap to make you boogaloo
Now the group ya hear is called Phase Two
And let me tell ya something we're a hell of a crew
Once a week we're on the street
Just a-cutting the jams and making it free
For you to party, got to have the moves
So we'll get right down and give you a groove
For you to dance you got to be hype
So we'll get right down for you tonight
Now the system's on and the girls are there
You definitely have a rocking affair
But let me tell ya something there's still one fact
That to have a party ya got to have a rap
So when the party's over, you're making it home
And trying to sleep before the break of dawn
And while ya sleeping you start to dream
And thinking how ya danced on the disco scene
A name appears in your mind
Yeah, a name you know that was right on time
It was phase two just a doing a do
Rocking ya down cause ya know we could
To the rhythm of the beat that makes ya freak
Come alive girls get on your feet
To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat
To the double beat beat that it makes ya freak
To the rhythm of the beat that says you go on
On and on into the break of dawn
Now I got a man coming on right now
He's guaranteed to throw down
He goes by the name of Wonder Mike
Come on Wonder Mike do what ya like

[Verse 8: Wonder Mike]
Like a can of beer that's sweeter than honey
Like a millionaire that has no money
Like a rainy day that is not wet
Like a gambling fiend that does not bet
Like Dracula without his fangs
Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang
Like collard greens that don't taste good
Like a tree that's not made out of wood
Like going up and not coming down
Is just like the beat without the sound, no sound
To the beat beat, ya do the freak
Everybody just rock and dance to the beat
Have you ever went over a friend's house to eat
And the food just ain't no good
I mean the macaroni's soggy the peas are mushed
And the chicken tastes like wood
So you try to play it off like you think you can
By saying that you're full
And then your friend says ""momma he's just being polite
He ain't finished uh-uh that's bull""
So your heart starts pumping and you think of a lie
And you say that you already ate
And your friend says ""man there's plenty of food""
So you pile some more on your plate
While the stinky food's steaming your mind starts to dreaming
Of the moment that it's time to leave
And then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rotting
Into something that looks like cheese
Oh so you say that's it I got to leave this place
I don't care what these people think
I'm just sitting here making myself nauseous
With this ugly food that stinks
So you bust out the door while its still closed
Still sick from the food you ate
And then you run to the store for quick relief
From a bottle of kaopectate
And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says ""I understand about the food
Baby but bubbah we're still friends""

[Hook 1: Wonder Mike]
With a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop and you don't stop
The rock it to the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat

[Post-Hook: Wonder Mike]
I say ""Hank can ya rock?
Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?
Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo""
I said ""come on, make uh, make the people move""

[Verse 9: Big Bank Hank]
I go to the halls and then ring the bell
Because I am the man with the clientele
And if ya ask me why I rock so well
I'm Big Bank, I got clientele
And from the time I was only six years old
I never forgot what I was told
It was the best advice that I ever had
It came from my wise dear old dad
He said ""sit down punk I wanna talk to you
And don't say a word until I'm through
Now there's a time to laugh a time to cry
A time to live and a time to die
A time to break and a time to chill
To act civilized or act real ill
But whatever ya do in your lifetime
Ya never let a MC steal your rhyme""
So from six to six 'til this very day
Ill always remember what he had to say
So when the sucker emcees try to chump my style
I let them know that I'm versatile
I got style, finesse and a little black book
That's filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look
But there's a thing that separates you from me
And that is called originality
Because my rhymes are on from what you heard
I didn't even bite and not a godd--m word
And I say a little more later on tonight
So the sucker emcees can bite all night
Uh, tick a tock y'all, a beat, beat y'all
A lets rock y'all, ya don't stop

[Hook 2: Big Bank Hank]
It go: Hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today (say what)
Cause I'ma get a fly girl gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ
Everybody go: Hotel, motel, holiday inn
You see if your girl starts acting up then you take her friends

[Post-Hook: Big Bank Hank]
A like that y'all to the beat y'all
A beat, beat y'all ya don't stop
Uh, Master Gee am I mellow?
Its on you so whatcha gonna do?

[Verse 10: Master Gee]
Well like Johnny Carson on the late show
A like Frankie Crocker in stereo
Well like the  Bar-Kays singing 'Holy Ghost'
The sounds to throw down they're played the most
Just like my man Captain Sky
Whose name he earned with his super sperm
We rock and we don't stop
Get off y'all I'm here to give you whatcha got
To the beat that it makes you freak
And come alive girl, uh, get on your feet
A like a Perry Mason without a case
Like Farrah Fawcett without her face
Like the barkays on the mic
Like getting right down for you tonight
Like moving your body so ya don't know how
Right to the rhythm and throw down
Like coming alive to the Master Gee
The brother who rocks so viciously
I said the age of one my life begun
At the age of two I was doing the do
At the age of three it was you and me
Rocking to the sounds of the Master Gee
At the age of four I was on the floor
Giving all the freaks what they bargained for
At the age of five I didn't take no jive
With the Master Gee its all the way live
At the age of six I was uh, picking up sticks
Rapping to the beat my stick was fixed
At the age of seven I was rocking in heaven
Dontcha know I went off
I got right on down to the beat you see
Getting right on down making all the girls
Just take of their clothes to the beat the beat
To the double beat, beat that makes you freak
At the age of eight I was, uh,  really great
Cause every night you see I had a date
At the age of nine I was, uh, right on time
Cause every night I had a part to rhyme
Going on and on and on, on and on
The beat don't stop until the break of dawn
A saying on and on and on, on and on
Like a hot buttered the pop the pop the popcorn
A saying on and on and on on and on
Cause I'm a helluva man when I'm on the mic
I am the definite feast delight
I'm a helluva man when I'm on the mic
I am the definite feast delight
Call me the master gee you see
The brother who rocks so viciously

[Hook 3: Master Gee]
I'm gonna freak ya here I'm gonna freak ya there
I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere

Back with the A-team, train on the track
Thought we were gone but you're wrong, now it's on, we back

Got a grip on a koozie if it's what she likes

74,I Hope You're Happy Now,"[Verse 1]
It's all on me, it's my mistake
I said ""I don't love you"" a little too late
But I guess there ain't ever a right time
And I don't know why it's called a goodbye

Go run my name into the ground
Tell everyone you know just how
How I slammed the door on our forever
But I promise you it's for the better

[Chorus]
I hope you find what you were looking for
I hope your heart ain't hurting anymore
And you get moving on, all figured out
And you don't hate me somehow
'Cause I hope you're happy now

[Verse 2]
Who knew this heart could break this hard
Or a love like ours could fall apart
Without so much as a warning
I thought that I was what you wanted

[Bridge]
Well I guess you found what you were looking for
I guess my heart ain't worth it anymore
I'm a wreck, I'm a mess
And I ain't got nothing left
And so I hope you're happy now

[Chorus]
I hope you find what you were looking for
I guess my heart ain't worth it anymore
Hope you get moving on, all figured out

So I hope you're happy now

Hey homecoming Queen
Why do you lie?
When somebody's mean
Where do you hide?
Do people assume
You're always alright?
Been so good at smiling
Most of your life

Look damn good in the dress
Zipping up the mess
Dancing with your best foot forward

If you started showing what's under your skin
What if you let 'em all in on the lie?

Still walking on eggshells
When that curtains closed

How to act tough?
Or more like your Mama?
Sweep it under the rug

Look damn good in the dress
Zipping up the mess
Dancing with your best foot forward
Did you want the crown?
Or does it weigh you down

If you started showing what's under your skin?
What if you let 'em all in on the lie?

To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

[Bridge]
Would we be better off by now
If I'd have let my walls come down?
Maybe, I guess we'll never know
You know, you know

[Chorus]
Before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go",Lewis Capaldi,2020,[85],1
85,Those Kinda Nights,"[Intro: Bizarre & Ed Sheeran]
Damn, girl, with your sexy ass, haha
Let me holla at you
D.A. got that dope
It's one of those kinda nights

[Verse 1: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
Yes, this beat’s takin' me back to my D12 days
When we hit the club to go and hell-raise
Probably end up baggin' the cocktail waitress
And takin’ her straight back to the Motel-8
Yeah, Bizarre's tryna get a lap dance
Off a Xanax and Jack Dan' (Ayo)
Stripper walk by, I'm like ""Goddamn""
She's like ""That's harassment,"" I'm like ""Yeah, and?"" (Woo)
Holy Toledo, it's Miss Ohio
That’s the best ass I’ve seen in a while
We should be datin', she’s from Cleveland
But she's a bengal, this chick is catty
Is that a mini-skirt if it's a maxi?
That's the shortest thing for a dress since an addy (Since an addy)
She said ""Fuck off"" and threw her liquor at me
It’s one of those kinda nights
Then I said, I said

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then, the smoke and the bottle are on me, ah
Slip into the red dress you like
When we arrive, we probably won't leave, ah
I love the way you move like that
When you push your body on mine, oh my
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sun rise
It's one of those kinda nights

[Verse 2: Eminem]
This beat keeps takin' me back like my ex does
Only 'cause how good the sex was
Hit up the next club, met Alexa
But she was so extra, called her etcetera
Had her like, ""Oh my God
My whole iPod's filled with your songs, I mow my lawn to 'em""
I said, ""Oh my God, you know my songs?
That's totally awesome, I'm Marshall, what's goin' on? Ah (Haha)
Seriously though, jokes aside, how you doin'? You straight?""
She said, ""No, I'm bi""
She said, ""Are you drunk?,"" I said, ""No, I'm high
I'm checkin' out the chick,"" she said, ""So am I""
""What's in the cup, let me see that
Girl, where the rest of that promethazine at?""
She said, ""Cool, gotta run out to my Cadillac though
And I'll be like Fat Joe, and bring the lean back""
Then I said

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then, the smoke and the bottle are on me, ah
Slip into the red dress you like
When we arrive, we probably won't leave, ah
I love the way you move like that
When you push your body on mine, oh my
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sun rise
It's one of those kinda—

[Verse 3: Eminem]
OMG
Like the gas in the tank, she's gettin' low on me
Said she wants to go with me
I said, ""Go with you where?"" She said, ""Out""
I said, ""I'm a candle, I'll go out if you blow on me""
Walk her out to the parkin' lot, here comes the brigade
Turn like a flip page, Swifty look shitfaced
Say peace to McVay and me and this chick take off like a sick day
Drivin' around, I said, ""Let's pull over,"" she said, ""No problemo
Windows are dark tint, roll up the car windows""
Monte Carlo in park, bumpin' Bizarre's demo
Gettin' head in the bucket, Marshmello
Yeah, I never in the club met a woman worth knowin'
But if you're ho'in
Opposites attract, I'm someone, you're a no one
I'm high and you're bi, I'm comin', you're goin'

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then, the smoke and the bottle are on me, ah
Slip into the red dress you like
When we arrive, we probably won't leave, ah
I love the way you move like that
When you push your body on mine, oh my
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sun rise
It's one of those kinda nights",Eminem,2020,"[86, 31]",2

I don’t need tools and I don’t need a process
I just need a feeling
I don’t need pools of money or the success
I just need the feeling

Way deep in my head they make sounds
They stay round they play round
Then they tuck in nice over bass sounds, they
They’re the colours inside my head, my mind, my head

[Pre-Chorus]
And we can turn back the clock
Making moves that I thought I wanted back at 21, 22, 23, 24
Never wrong, thought I was never wrong
And better off just wanting less
But I knew all of me wanted more (yeah)

And we eating with the grownups now
I never knew my chances on the way up
Seated at the kids table

All trust no rust with the pen now
We do not play pretend now
Hide and seek that depends
No if’s just when now
Throwing caution to the wind now
Yeah we gon' win (we gon' win, we gon' win)
Always drew outside the lines
Guess I wanted me a bigger picture
And my cloud is at the nines
When they load the beat, pull the trigger
I don’t seem to mind no
When you come to mind
Or that we chasing from behind
I know
Can’t go slow no
Can’t complain no

Watch me, goin' out of the way, when I shoulda went home
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own
I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib
Should drive by right where you live and pick you up on the way
We ain't spoke in so long, prolly put me in the past
I can still get you wet, and I can still make you laugh
You should call into work if that ain't too much to ask
I could pour you up a drink and we can burn somethin'

Someone put a order in for a chicken (for a chicken)
Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen (need the kitchen)

Baby, I heat up the stove, you do the dishes, ya know?

And ya know I need ya back in my life
Girl, ya know ya got that, know ya got that thing that I like
Girl, you got that thing for real

Who else got all the things you need at 4am when it's late?

I don't wanna be alone, I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)

[Verse 1]
Here I am, alone again
Can't get out of this hole I'm in
It's like the walls are closin' in
You can't help me, no one can
I can feel these curtains closin'
I go to open 'em
But something pulls 'em closed again
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
Feels like I'm loathing in Las Vegas
Haven't got the vaguest why I'm so lost
But I'd make you this small wager
If I bet you I'll be in tomorrow's paper
Who would the odds favor?
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
I'm so much like my father, you would think that I knew him
I keep pacin' this room, Valium, then chase it with booze
One little taste, it'll do
Maybe I'll take it and snooze, then tear up the stage in a few
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
Fuck the Colt 45, I'ma need somethin' stronger
If I pop any caps, it better be off of vodka
Round after round after round, I'm gettin' loaded (Haha)
That's a lot of shots, huh? (Double entendre)

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness (Yeah)
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)

[Verse 2]
Now I'm starin' at the room service menu off a benzo
I can hear the music continue to crescendo
I can see the whole fuckin' venue from my window
That's when you know you're schizo (Hello, darkness, my old friend)
'Cause I keep peekin' out the curtain from the hotel
The music is so loud
But it's almost as though I don't hear no sound
I should get ready for the show now
Wait, is this the whole crowd? I thought this shit was sold out
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
But it's only the opening act, it's early, don't overreact
Then something told me relax
And just hope for the show to be packed
Don't wanna hit the stage before they fill each row to the max
'Cause that'd be totally wack
You can't murder a show nobody's at (Hello darkness, my old friend)
But what if nobody shows? Panic mode
'Bout to snap and go motherfuckin' wacko at any second
'Bout to cancel the show just as fans below rush the entrance
Plan is a go to wreck shit, cameras in all directions (Hello, darkness, my old friend)
The press is 'bout to go ape shit, bananas on all the networks
Commando with extra clips, I got ammo for all the hecklers
I'm armed to the teeth, another Valium, fall off the bed
Hit the ground and crawl to the dresser
Alcohol on my breath as I reach for the scope
I'm blackin' out, I'm all out of meds
With them benzodiazepines gone
Now it's just magazines sprawled out on the floor
Fuck the media, I'm goin' all out, this is war
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness (Yeah)
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore (Hello, darkness, my old friend)

[Verse 3]
People start to show up, time to start the show up
It's 10:05 PM and the curtain starts to go up
And I'm already sweatin', but I'm locked and loaded
For rapid fire spittin' for all the concert-goers
Scopes for sniper vision, surprise from out of nowhere
As I slide the clip in from inside the hotel
Leanin' out the window, going Keyser Söze
Finger on the trigger, but I'm a licensed owner
With no prior convictions, so law says sky's the limit
So my supply's infinite, strapped like I'm a soldier
Got 'em hopping over walls and climbing fences
Some of them John Travolta, staying alive by inches
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
Cops are knockin', oh fuck, thought I blocked the entrance
Guess show time is over
No suicide note, just a note for target distance
But if you'd like to know the reason why I did this
You'll never find a motive, truth is I have no idea
I am just as stumped, no signs of mental illness
Just tryin' to show ya the reason why we're so fucked
'Cause by the time it's over, won't make the slightest difference
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness
I don't wanna be alone in the darkness anymore

You fuck with me, yuh, yuh (You fuck with me)
I pull up and make it a scene (I pull up and make it a scene)
Yuh, yuh, I pull up and bust out the beam
Bullets fly, legs buckle, bodies pile to the sky
Thousand rounds will lay you down, we got enough to go around
You fuck with me, yuh, yuh (You fuck with me)
I pull up and make it a scene (I pull up and make it a scene)

93,First Man,"[Verse 1]
Yes, I'm gonna stay with him tonight
I’ll see you in the mornin'
No, of course he won't drink and drive
Can you say bye to mom for me?
Oh, you’ll like him, he's really kind
And he's funny like you sometimes
And I found someone I really like
Maybe for the first time

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I don't need a jacket
It's not that cold tonight
And you worry, I get it
But he's waitin' outside

[Chorus]
I swear on my heart that he's a good man
I know you’ll stay up late just waitin’ for me
You held me so tight, now someone else can
But you were the first man that really loved me

[Verse 2]
Now you're driving to the airport
Not just me you pick up anymore
I’ve got eight days off comin' up
And I can only come home for four

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I just met his family
They're just like you and mom (Oh)
He makes me really happy
I think he might be the one, oh

[Chorus]
I swear on my heart that he's a good man
I promise he loves me, he’d never hurt me
You held me so tight, now someone else can
But you were the first man that really loved me
Now you're on the driveway, faking a smile
You wish you could tell him he doesn't deserve me
So I had to stop the car and turn around
To tell you you were the first man that really loved me

[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah

[Bridge]
And before they open up the doors
I say, ""I've never seen you cry before""
You say, ""You've never looked so beautiful
You know you'll always be my little girl""

[Chorus]
You're looking at me while walking down the aisle
With tears in your eyes, maybe he deserves me
You don't even know how much it means to me now
That you were the first man that really loved me
Oh, really loved me
Oh, you really love me",Camila Cabello,2020,[94],1

[Verse 1]
Ayy, when you told me that you'd love me
Was I a fool to believe in you?
When you told me I was special
Was I dumb for trusting you?
When you told me that you want me
Did you really want me?
Or was this all a joke to you? (To you, to you)
I don't wanna say, ""I miss you""
If I don't know that you miss me back (Oh, no, no)
I don't wanna say the wrong thing
If I do, there's no coming back

I wish I told you that I loved you
Now it's too late, you have someone new
I hope he loves you like I do
Do you love the way he's treating you?

What if I told you that I love you?
Would you tell me that you love me back? (Me back)

And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga

How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga?
If niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up (way up)
Yeah, the 6 ain't friendly but that's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay up

Fuck all that ""Drake, you gotta chill"" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit
Yeah, I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga

Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this

The other night
Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real

Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

[Verse 1: Young M.A]
I like a bitch that like to wobble, wobble
Shake it, shake it, break it, break it, uh
Nigga, we made it, made it, they hate it, hate it
Pro professional, pure persistent, I'm paper chasing
I hate complaining, I hated waiting, I'll pay for patience
But I hate to pay a bill (Hate that)
And I made a mil' without a major deal (I made that)
Yeah, her ass fake, but she came for real (She came, uh)
Money ain't a thing, that ain't a thing for real
It's the broke lingo (Huh)
And no, ain't nothing Saweetie, this is no Quavo (Migo)
Man, I just get high, let my hoes lay low (Ooh)
I just want some face but this is no facial (Ooh)
Do right and kill er'body, Drake mode (Hello)
Bitch, I'm tryna eat out, take your plate mode (Hello)
Disrespect that life and I'm in gang mode (Grrr)
You can leave this earth, bitch, I'm in rake mode (Huh)
I'm in cake mode (Huh), I'm in brave mode, uh
What up, Marshall? I'm a martian, I'm in Wayne mode (Facts)
Neck wet, big drip, I'm in rain mode (Drip, drip, drip)
Eight niggas, eight hittas, take eight souls (Brrr)
Collect pesos (Huh), and I'm paid, so? (Paid)
Self-made goals (Hey)
When the pain leaves (Huh)
Where does the pain go? (Where?)
Tip of the backwood is where the flame goes (There)
To the sky is where my brain goes (Wow)
Same pack, same fiend, sellin' the same clothes (Wow)
Pinocchio and my pistol, they got the same nose
Me and my niggas gotta eat, we share the same stove (What?)
Case closed, bodies in my lane, bitch, lane closed

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Game over, Thanos on you H-O's
On my petty shit but I don't paint toes (Yeah)
Get the plunger (Plunger) 'cause Marshall and M.A go plum crazy
Call us liquid plumber, 'cause even Dre know (Dre know)
Beat knocks like a beefed up Detox
You're gonna need three SWATs or police officers at least to come pull me off of it and I don't stop
Please dawg, I need y'all to keep talking shit 'cause I feed off of it
I am the complete opposite of these retards who spit these weak bars, I'ma leave carnage
Each thought'll be so toxic, it'll block the wind through your esophagus
Stop it, cutting off your oxygen
And I hit them pads like a boxing gym
Better watch for Slim, better get to popping and when I'm at the top again
I won't topple, I'm giving it to anyone who wanna come and get it and I'm not gonna stop
But when they ask me is the war finished with MGK? Of course it is
I cleansed him of his mortal sins, I'm God and the Lord forgives even the devil worshippers
I'm moving on but you know your scruples are gone when you're born with Lucifer's horns
And you're from the school of Notorious, Puba, Cube and The Poor Righteous Teachers tutored my students
Showed them all the blueprint and formula
But it seems like the more they studied my music, the more they remind me of eyeballs
I'm watching my pupils get cornier (Uh)
But I'm contemplating yelling ""Bombs away"" on the game
Like I'm outside of an Ariana Grande concert waiting

[Chorus: Eminem]
They call me Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini
Where's Osama been? I been laden lately
Look at how I'm behaving, they want me gone away
They wanna JonBenet me (Fuck you), I'm unaccommodating

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Man, I don't see why they hate me (Huh?)
I'm a clown like John Wayne Gacy (What?)
They call me Kanye crazy (Yah)
APESHIT, Beyonce, Jay-Z (Woo)
And I'm back with Andre, baby (Yeah)
And the doctor's operating (What?)
But he never put no scrubs on from Snoop, K. Dot to Shady
Shady like a shadow or your silhouette, intellect, I better check to see why you feel upset
'Cause I met your bitch on the internet now I'm getting head like a Pillow Pet
That bimbo can put her lips all the way around this bone and then blow
Like a dusty cartridge from an old Nintendo
Those were the days but I bet you, I'm never gonna be broke again, no
I don't smoke but I got paper, to be blunt, I'm rolling Indo
And I keep it one comma, zero, zero, zero, zero
Real, real, real, murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill
Nickel-plated, twenty two, two, two
Bitch, shut the fuck up 'fore I shoot you too
Ain't shit I won't do just to get a few YouTube views
Run up in a church like pew, pew, pew
'Cause that's what I do, do, do
But, even to the untrained human eye
We ain't the same, you and I
Somebody should have explained to you why
For you to go against me, it's simply insane, you will die (Yeah)
That's why they call me Kamikaze, it's plain suicide, yeah
But I know magic and here go my last trick
I'm 'bout to say ""Abracadabra"" and pull a B Rabbit up out of my hat
I'm about to relapse and I betcha that you won't know how to react
But a look of disgust, I don't doubt it'd be that
As I begin to fuckin' devour the track
And you backpedal, that is a cowardly act
Like a Saudi attack when the towers collapsed

[Chorus: Eminem]
They call me Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini
Where's Osama been? I been laden lately

They wanna JonBenet me (Fuck you), I'm unaccommodating",Eminem,2020,"[97, 36]",2
97,July,"[Verse 1: Drake]
This verse starts as my snipers hit their marks
And your guards fall down from a rifle to the heart
Like, clap, clap, let em fall slow
I know you had your fears, you can let 'em all go
And most women are motivated so I act accordingly
But this is so refreshing that it means a little more to me
Dedicating time when I really can’t afford to be
I provide protection if you open up the door for me
Couple stares, couple texts, couple dates
Couple ""I think that we’re ready""s
Couple ""I think that we should we wait""s
Are we actin' like a couple ?I’m just tryna get it straight
Cause I’m over here convinced that it’s too early for mistakes
And then

[Bridge: Jhene Aiko]
Oh, you had to change up the game
Oh, the weather is not the same
Now there’s only cloudy days
Can’t stand the rain in July
Oh July, there were fireworks explodin'
But now it’s getting colder
Leaves are turning color
Why, it’s just not our season
The one and only reason
Baby oh, baby oh
Our summer turned into fall

[Verse 2: Drake]
Damn, tell me where did all the magic go
I followed the rules and told you everything you had to know
Had you over every night, every night was passionate
Plus, you met my mother even if it was an accident
I’m confused tell me where we go wrong
I was sure that I would be with you for so long
I was planning on this on being something worth mentioning
Energy invested in someone I saw potential in
Who killed chivalry? They need to get their sentencin'
Meanwhile we arguing and I can’t get a sentence in
And just as I predicted here we go again
They always say the hottest love has the coldest end

[Bridge: Jhene Aiko]
Oh, you had to change up the game
Oh, the weather is not the same
Now there’s only cloudy days
Can’t stand the rain in July
Oh July, there were fireworks explodin'
But now it’s getting colder
Leaves are turning color
Why, it’s just not our season
The one and only reason
Baby oh, baby oh
Our summer turned into fall

[Jhene Aiko]
See it's funny cause I never thought this would end
But then the season changed

[Drake]
You were my, you were my, you were my girl
Shoulda made, shoulda made you my world
Shoulda done everything to make you happy, baby
Oh yeah

Can’t wait for, can’t wait for, can’t wait for springtime

You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9""]
I'm a product of properly hoppin' up out of that poverty
Profitin' all for coppin' and swappin' that property out for a possible monopoly
Try not to adopt my father's old philosophies
Same time I'm prayin' to God that everything works out at his colonoscopy
I'm walkin' across a suicidal tightrope intentionally
While the demons comin' out of me
Wifey's on the side of me talkin' sense into me
Without she, I feel incomplete mentally, she's been sent to me
Right there since '9-6, worse nightmare to side chicks, some things are just meant to be
This it for me, give my daughters a kiss for me
Y'all call this fame, I call this shit alcoholistic infamy
Targettin' my kids and babies through population and gun control
Shit make me wanna make a hunnid more
Make a bigot racist uncomfortable
If y'all against talk and reparation then I'm not against the thought of separation
While the politicians that are white and privileged ask how is this different from segregation, that's funny bro
Segregation is bein' told where I'm gonna go
Separation is bein' woke and goin' wherever I wanna go

[Chorus: White Gold]
Pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn
You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn
But I pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn
Pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn

You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn
But I pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Never sold dope, from the gold rope
Wanted one though, they were so dope (Yeah)
Was a have-not (Yeah) 'cause my pockets (Uh)
Didn't have knots, I was so broke
On my last rock, for my slingshot
Better haul ass, don't be no slow poke (Nope)
Through the tall grass, run your ass off (Yeah)
Oh no, got your pants caught on the fence post
Getting chased, by them Jackboys, think it's 'bout to fuzz
Like a lint roller they wait 'til it's late, they will tiptoe
Through your living room window
Take your Nintendo and then skate
Making you feel like you got bent over and raped
Little boy, you're never gonna get no rope chain
Get your shit stole, and your lip swole, I became bitter
As I got a little bit older, my hate
Was making me get cold, and began to get a chipped shoulder
Started to spit vulgar, my ZIP code had been skid row
But I ate every single beat that I spit over, the shithole I escaped
Then I began to explode, detonate, now the Eastside went schizo
Thought my name was B-side 'cause they flipped over my tape
And I won't hesitate
To get 'em all bent so outta shape
Oh shit, bro, hold up, wait
I just tripped over my cape (Superman)
And I'm not gonna let up, treat the paper like I'm chopping a letter
Dre'll tell you how I shred
So when you refer to the guy next to the doc, you meant shredder
Now the cops wanna set up roadblocks on my head, I
Got several bounties from feds in every county
I'm with a gal at a Checkers wiling
Bumping ""Fuck Da Police"" while I fed her Rally's
This shit is like Romper Room
Why do I feel responsible for these kids?
All of whom I'm a father to
I'm a God to you, y'all better worship the water I walk on
Or y'all gonna meet your Waterloo
I get to flippin' the mic' as a murder weapon
I'm poppin' an extra clip, then cock and shoot, then I'm popping
Do not let me catch you slippin'
I will pop up and I'll take a spot from you
I'll get to doing what a leaky faucet do
But I ain't talkin' drip when I say that I'll get the drop on you
Singin' fuck all of you in Autotune
I am too volatile and too grizzly to bear
Yeah, shit is gettin' to where I can barely even sit in a chair
I bust my ass for this shit and I swear
It ain't even worth dissing someone so offbeat
That they can't even figure out where their words
Should hit the kick and the snare

[Chorus: White Gold]
Pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn
You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn
But I pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn
Pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn

With a big old adios to wishes wasted on them falling stars

101,Leaving Heaven,"[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah (I knew this day was coming)
Sometimes, you gotta come back down (It's all going to hell now, man)
Stoop to someone's level (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Five dozen flies buzzin' over your head
Call me the Grim Reaper, sleep is my cousin
You're dead to me now and I'ma be the last face you see
'Fore you die cussin' (Yep)
My eye a tiger's and I'm a survivor so I will rise up and (What?)
Be triumphant 'cause when I'm looking at my legacy (Leg, I see)
Bunch of dogs tryna dry hump it
Like Triumph The Puppet, so I'm like, ""Fuck it""
Pile the carnage up 'til it's so high, it's touching the sky
Let 'em all line up and attack
Single filing up in the stack
Call 'em toy soldiers (Yeah)
'Cause they just wind up on their backs
Now the sky's nothing but black
But I am not coming back, I done told ya
I told the woke me to go to sleep
But still, they keep on provoking me
They're hoping to see me completely broken emotionally
But how in the fuck am I not supposed to be woke
When these fuckers just keep poking me? Now

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm leaving Heaven
I'm leaving Heaven
Angels won't find me
Where I am going

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I've been down, kicked
Like around six thousand times since I was a kid
As a child, picked on, clowned, been
Countless times I've been outed
Gotta remind myself of it every now and then (Yeah)
So the route I went's self-empowerment
In a hole, taught myself how to get out of it
And balance it with talents, wit
'Cause life is like a penny (Life is like a penny)
'Cause it's only one percent
Who overcome the shit they've underwent
I went AWOL like what my back was up against
Don't tell me 'bout struggle, bitch, I lived it
I was five or six the first time I got my hind end kicked
Malcolm, Isaac, and Boogie jumped me and took my tricycle
And I don't know if I would call that white privilege, yeah
But I get it, how it feels to be judged by pigment
Besides getting it from both sides of the tracks
But I swore I'd get them back
Even if it meant selling my soul to get my revenge and (What?)
Thought of a scheme and it got me to thinking
If I can believe in myself, I could prolly achieve it
That’s part of the reason I do all my talking with ink
And as long as I'm breathing, I vow to smother and beat them
My god, what a heart of a demon, go at 'em and I'ma get even
Like I'm in the Garden of Eden, I'm 'bout to go off of the deep end
This evil is calling, I'm already seething and

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm leaving Heaven
I'm leaving Heaven
Angels won't find me
Where I am going

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Okay, so while Macklemore was keeping his room nice and neat (Yeah)
I was getting my ass beat twice a week (What?)
Looking for a place for the night where I could sleep (Yeah)
Flippin' sofa cushions over just tryin' to see
If I could find some change and scrape up for a bite to eat
If Denaun and me find a couple dimes a piece
Twenty five cents each'd get us a bag of chips
We'd be glad to get that even we if we had to split
We'd do backward flips, looking back at it
I think that would fit with the definition of not having shit
Couple that with the fact my mother was batshit
Pop was a sack of shit, yeah, he died, but I gave half a shit
Yeah, which brings me back to the dear 'ol dad that I zero had
Since a year-old, forty-seven year-old scab
Just to hear them words, ear piercing
Like my earlobe stabbed with a needle for an earring
Should I feel upset? You were dead to me 'fore you died
Me? Tear no shed
Should I have made a mural at your funeral?
Had your coffin draped with a hero's flag?
Where the fuck you were at
When De'Angelo done hurt me real bad at the Rio Grande?
Never met your grandkids, fucking coward
Only guts you had was from your stomach fat
I couldn't see your ass goin' to Heaven
So I'm asking for a pass to go to Hell
So I can whip your fucking ass
I hate that I'll never get to say ""I hate you"" to your face
No coming back from where I'm going
Sky is dark, my soul is black, hand on the shovel
Dig with the blade of it then I step on the metal
Vendetta to settle, tell the Devil

[Chorus: Skylar Grey & Eminem]
I'm leaving Heaven (Yeah)
I'm leaving Heaven (You know, I should dig your motherfucking ass up)
Angels won't find me (Just to spit in your fucking face)
Where I am going (Holding my baby pictures up like you're proud of me)
I'm leaving heaven (Fuck you, bitch)
I'm leaving heaven (You know what? Maybe if I had had you)
Angels won't find me (I wouldn't have went through half the shit I went through, so I blame you)
Where I am going (Or maybe I should say, ""Thank you"")
('Cause I wouldn't have been me, haha)

[Outro: Skylar Grey & Eminem]
So you better, you better run (Yeah)
You better, you better run (So I'ma let it go now, rest in peace)
You better, you better run (Cocksucker, haha)
You better, you better run (See you in Hell)",Eminem,2020,[61],1

Uh-huh, life's like this
Uh-huh, uh-huh
That's the way it is
'Cause life's like this
Uh-huh, uh-huh
That's the way it is

[Verse 1]
Chill out, whatcha yelling for?
Lay back, it's all been done before
And if you could only let it be, you will see
I like you the way you are
When we're drivin' in your car
And you're talkin' to me one-on-one
But you become

[Pre-Chorus]
Somebody else 'round everyone else
You're watchin' your back like you can't relax
You're tryin' to be cool
You look like a fool to me
Tell me

[Chorus]
Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Actin' like you're somebody else, gets me frustrated
Life's like this, you
And you fall, and you crawl, and you break
And you take what you get
And you turn it into honesty
And promise me, I'm never gonna find you fake it
No, no, no

[Verse 2]
You come over unannounced
Dressed up like you're somethin' else
Where you are and where it's at, you see
You're makin' me
Laugh out when you strike your pose
Take off all your preppy clothes
You know, you're not foolin' anyone
When you become

[Pre-Chorus]
Somebody else 'round everyone else
You're watchin' your back like you can't relax
You're tryin' to be cool
You look like a fool to me
Tell me

Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Actin' like you're somebody else, gets me frustrated

103,Hand Me Downs,"[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I'm thinkin' maybe I should thank you
Oh baby I should buy you another round
'Cause you care, and I swear that I'm here, but I'm there
It's getting harder to hunt me down
Get away to a place where the lakes such a great view
Leave the bank, couple hunnid thou'
I made it, but I hate once I build it I break it down
Might just break me down

[Pre-Chorus: Mac Miller]
And all I ever needed was somebody with some reason who can keep me sane
Ever since I can remember I've been keeping it together but I'm feeling strange
Get away when it ain't really safe and it don't seem right
But what's new? You get used to the bullshit, the screws they go missing
It's likely they might be but...

[Chorus: Baro Sura]
You remind me
Shit, I need to stay in line
You damn well are a great design
You, despite being an only child
Say you need more of a family 'round
Let's turn these genes into hand me downs
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah, well I'm just being honest my conscience ain't doin' bad
Because I try to minus the problems that I attract
And half the time the wheels that's in the back of my mind
Just keep on turning 'til the tires flat and burn until the fire crack
I do not lie though, facts may seem a little farfetched
That's only 'cause I may be make believe and full of darkness
When I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place
Walk and drop in change inside your empty guitar case
That's charity um, I move carelessly that's why I'm always tripping
I guess that's like electrolytes you help me go the distance
Not too efficient but the way it's always been
Until the day we have to meet again

[Pre-Chorus: Mac Miller]
Get away when it ain't really safe and it don't seem right
But what's new? You get used to the bullshit, the screws they go missing
It's likely they might be but...

[Chorus: Baro Sura]
You remind me
Shit, I need to stay in line
You damn well are a great design

104,Premonition (Intro),"[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah
So I guess this is what it is, huh?
Think it's obvious
We ain't never gonna see eye to eye
But it's funny
As much as I hate you
I need you
This is music to be murdered by

[Chorus: Nikki Grier]
Got a premonition
I feel the end is near
The beauty starts to fade
The joy has turned to pain
I hear the symphony playin'
Ten thousand violins
Souls floating away like feathers in the wind

[Verse: Eminem]
They said my last album I sounded bitter
No, I sound like a spitter
Who ninety percent of
These hypocrites are tryna get rid of
But why would I get a chip on my shoulder?
I was considered, one time, as the illest
Bitch, I'm still as fly as your zipper
True, I just get richer
But if it was ever all about skrilla
Then I woulda quit a long motherfucking time ago
Bitch, shut the fuck up
I should go say that shit to Tech N9ne or to Jigga
Nobody said shit about 2 Chainz as long as he's been here, shit
No wonder you're mad, now I'm
Looking at them plaques, count 'em (Yeah)
I'm LL Cool J, Bigger and Deffer, that's how come (Uh)
I sell like four mil' when I put out a bad album (What?)
Revival flopped, came back and I scared the crap out 'em
But Rolling Stone stars, I get two and a half outta
Five, and I'll laugh out loud
'Cause that's what they gave BAD back in the day
Which actually made me not feel as bad now, 'cause
If it happened to James
It can happen to Shady
They do the same shit to Brady
More people hate me than love me
This game will make you go crazy
'Bout to go for B-R-O-K-E
I was the G, the O-A-T
Once I was played in rotation
At every radio station
They said I'm lyrically amazing
But I have nothing to say
But then when I put out Revival and I had something to say
They said that they hated the awake me
I lose the rage, I'm too tame
I get it back, they say I'm too angry
I need to get me some Dre beats
No, I should hook up with Tay Keith
Fans keep on pulling me one way
Haters pull me in another
Got more hooks in me than Swae Lee
'Bout to pick up some weights and lift 'til my tattoo of Hailie's face stretches
They said I'm just a whiner, I sound like a baby
I dish it out but can't take it
But I take it, dish it back out
And they get all bent out of shape
This shit's almost comical
Wait, and I meant no disrespect
I wasn't dissin' Tech, that was not a shot at 2 Chainz or to Jay-Z
They probably feel the same way because lately
Instead of us being credited for longevity
And being able to keep it up for this long at this level, we
Get told we'll never be what we were
Bitch, if I was as half as good as I was
I'm still twice as good as you'll ever be
Only way that you're ahead of me's alphabetically
'Cause if you diss me I'm coming after you like the letter V
Killing everything, play this tune, it's your eulogy
It's your funeral, prepare to die
This is music for you to be murdered by",Eminem,2020,[67],1
105,I Can See,"[Verse 1]
I'm so close I can taste it
The man on the moon keep playing
Practical jokes, planting the mirrors and smoke
That I fade away in
You be complaining
And I can't explain it
I guess, nothin' compare to the feeling
The feeling amazing
Now I'm switchin' location
'Cause Heaven too far when you live in the basement
I'm lookin' for balance, I'm in an oasis
Well, I need somebody to save me, hmm
Before I drive myself crazy

[Chorus]
And now I know if life is but a dream then so are we
Show me something, show me something, show me something
And now I know if life is but a dream then so are we
Show me something, show me something, something I can see

[Verse 2]
Yeah, don't tell me to stop
Let me keep goin' until I cannot
Life is a fantasy until you wake up in shock
Hittin' the ground, I'm hittin' the ground, I fell from the top
You never expect to drop, so hold on, but
That just the way it goes, your God don't wait for no one
And when that's all you know, it keep you on your toes
You got so far to go, but look at where you came from

[Chorus]
And now I know if life is but a dream then so are we
Show me something, show me something, show me something
And now I know if life is but a dream then so are we
Show me something, show me something, something I can see",Mac Miller,2020,[68],1
106,In Too Deep,"[Verse 1]
""This could never work,"" is what we said at first
But whatever this is, it's working
But we're in two different worlds and (Yeah)
I'm not your husband (Nah), you ain't my girlfriend
All I know is that (What?)
When I'm with you, I'm a different person, yeah
And I ain't never met a chick as perfect
Girl, you're a ten, so here I am (Yeah)
Laying here with her again
Thinking 'bout you
She's asleep, you're texting me around two
Crying face emoji, you say, ""This is me without you""
We're sneaking out to meet at cheap hotel rooms or
Sex in the car, then I'll text you tomorrow
Do I question it? Nah, no objection at all
'Cause both of us are still involved, so
As I'm peelin' off, all I'm thinking 'bout is

[Chorus]
I'm not happy here (Nah), with her
Rather have you (Yeah), rather have me too
'Cause you're not happy there (You're not happy there), with him
Rather have me (I know, but), we’re just in too deep

[Verse 2]
You're laying there with him, thinking 'bout me
He's asleep, you say, ""Let's meet around three""
You went to leave the house, he caught you sneaking out, now he's freaking out
You thought he was sleepin' soundly, woah
You say you're going for a drive, you don't question him
When he stumbles in, like, ""Where the fuck you've been?""
Then you pump his ear with what he wants to hear
Tell him you love him, yeah, wipe each other's tears
But it's been a couple years since we been doin' dirt
You or my girl, don't wanna see either of you get hurt
But now the lines are getting super blurred
Can't tell if I'm cheating on her with you or cheating on you with her
But really, nobody's at fault, can't help who you love
Hope they don't overhear us talk
'Cause we both are getting sloppy
Probably subconsciously part of me's hoping we get caught 'cause

[Chorus]
I'm not happy here (Nah), with her
Rather have you (Yeah), rather have me too
'Cause you're not happy there (You're not happy there), with him
Rather have me (I know, but), we’re just in too deep

[Verse 3]
We're laying here with them, thinking 'bout us
'Cause now when we get home, we get jealous
Of each other being someone else's
Call us Long John Silver's 'cause we selfish
But I just wanna see ya
Don't care if it's at the Ritz or Motel 6
If I'm there with ya, rich or poor
When I'm laying here with ya, it could be the kitchen floor
I could stay in bed with ya starin' at ya 'til the morn'
I just wanna be your secret lover, yeah
I'd rather share ya than to not have you at all
So once a year or twice a month I'm here if you want it
Yeah, I'm open season
And I'm always game, so I keep it a hundred, dear, haha
'Cause we could never be each other's everythings, you got a wedding ring
So it's him instead of me, but I'll be your second string, now and forever because

[Chorus]
I'm not happy here (Nah), with her
Rather have you (Yeah), rather have me too
'Cause you're not happy there (You're not happy there), with him
Rather have me (I know, but), we’re just in too deep (I'm in way too deep)",Eminem,2020,[71],1

Everybody got the same swag now
Watch the way that I tear it down
Stackin' my bands all the way to the top
All the way 'til my bands fallin' over

Okay I was gone for a minute but I'm back now
Sit the fuck back down
Seem like everybody nowadays Hollywood
Oh, it’s like that now?
I'ma show you mothafuckas how to act now
I'ma show 'em how to act
I'ma show 'em how to act

[Verse 1]
Okay now picture little Bobby just a youngin' runnin' round
With his mans, hammer in his hands, feelin' like the man
Run, mothafucka, run
Before the popo get the gun, put it to your brain like goddamn!
Everybody know you ain't about it
Everything you talk about I know I can live without it
Red light, stop. Green light, go!
Everything ain't what it seem like
Mothafucka I know!
Hold up, what you mean, where you been?
Bitch, I been in
This is merely the beginning again
What you been living in?
A box, under the bridge, like Anthony Kiedis?
Looking for something to complete us
And maybe lead us, fuck an elitist
Hell of a long way from equal is how they treat us
Body of a builder with the mind of a fetus
Turn on the television and see the vision they feed us
And I wish I could erase that, face facts

Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know, how it go
Everybody people, everybody bleed, everybody need something
Everybody love, everybody know

[Verse 2]
I been knockin' doors down like a Jehovah witness
God as my witness, I'm with this
But on the real, I think I need another witness!
If it was 1717, black daddy, white momma wouldn't change a thing
Light skin mothafucka certified as a house nigga
Well I'll be God damned, go figure
In my blood is the slave and the master
It's like the devil playin' spades with the pastor
But he was born with the white privilege!
Man, what the fuck is that?
White people told me as a child, as a little boy, playin' with his toys
I should be ashamed to be black
And some black people look ashamed when I rap
Like my great granddaddy didn’t take a whip to the back
Not accepted by the black or the white
I don't give a fuck, praise God, I could see the light
Everybody talkin' 'bout race this, race that
I wish I could erase that, face facts

""Just a feeling I've got. Like something's about to happen, but I don't know what.

""You are just what the doc ordered.""

I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot

[Verse 1]
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody wants the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got

[Verse 2]
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!""—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard

[Verse 3]
So you'll be Thor, I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?!
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?",Eminem,2020,[83],1
110,No Regrets,"[Intro: Eminem & Don Toliver]
(Oh, oh, yeah) Yeah
You know, if I had a chance to do it all over again (Oh, oh)
I wouldn't change shit (Oh, oh)
D.A. got that dope
I'm screamin' out no regrets

[Chorus: Don Toliver]
You been through the hardest spot, ego the largest, I made you a star (I'm screamin' out no regrets)
I been movin' slowly, tryna play it low, the 'Vette look like a storm (Screamin' out no regrets)
Put you through dumb shit, got you thinkin' I run shit (I ain't havin' regrets)
I've been feeling so alone, just like I'm so lost, just like I'm—

[Verse 1: Eminem & Don Toliver]
Yeah, they miss the old me
I think they want me to OD on codeine
They want my life in turmoil like in '03
They want front row seats, I give 'em nosebleeds
They want me imploding, exploding, self-loathing, eroding
I'm screaming at 'em with no regrets and I'm hulking
I'm rippin' out of my clothing
I had to go see the doc like Kool Moe Dee (Yeah)
Never took much to convince Dre
Never been swayed by color or skin shades
Since day one, Hellraiser with twin blades of a sensei
Givin' up, no comprende (Woo)
Tin brain, prolly fucked in the membrane
Slim Sha— mind's in the gutter, but insane
Pen game like I just struck in the tenth frame (Screamin' out no regrets)
Yeah, I live on the edge, I sit on the ledge
To shit on your heads, I been on the bench
Forgive and forget is the only thing I'd ever live to regret
Hell-bent on revenge, you left me for dead
I crawled out my grave, you better be ready and set
My enemies ain't put an end to me yet (I'm screamin' out no regrets)

[Chorus: Don Toliver & Eminem]
You been through the hardest spot, ego the largest, I made you a star (I'm screamin' out no regrets)
I been movin' slowly, tryna play it low, the 'Vette look like a storm (Screamin' out no regrets, yeah, no apologies, I ain't takin' shit back)
Put you through dumb shit, got you thinkin' I run shit (I ain't havin' regrets)
I've been feeling so alone, just like I'm so (Yeah) lost

[Verse 2: Eminem]
All the hate, can't tell exactly where it stems from
But it's happening again, huh?
Y'all used to be in my corner
Now you just backed me in one
Innocent bystanders, I'm bound to hit some
For some adversaries, I carry big guns
So some targets'll get the kill shot
Some, I just barely nicked 'em
I can make a mistake and erupt and end up takin' a dump
Or sayin' some dumb shit, thinkin' I run shit
Misplacin' my anger enough to give Earl and Tyler, The Creator the brunt (Yeah)
Shoulda never made a response, shoulda just aimed for the fake ones
Them traitorous punks, 'cause snakes are just cunts
They can get fucked with eight hundred motherfuckin' vibrators at once (Yeah)
And for any of those who may have come close to about dyin'
And can't listen to ""Arose"" without cryin'
For those who feel low like you're 'bout spiralin'
But this is only for those that I'm inspirin'
Weapon never unholstered without firin'
My will I'm imposin', foes are gonna feel like they're in the throes of a mountain lion
They talk about my daughters hopin' I fly off of the handle (Handle)
'Cause my first thought is to trample and write a thousand bars
But sometimes it's like dropping' an anvil on a house of cards
Or Godzilla squashin' a crouton with combat boots on
Or droppin' a goddamn nuke bomb on top of an anthill
(I'm screamin' out no regrets) Can't do it, nah

[Chorus: Don Toliver & Eminem]
You been through the hardest spot, ego the largest, I made you a star (I'm screamin' out no regrets, took it all)
I been movin' slowly, tryna play it low, the 'Vette look like a storm (Screamin' out no regrets, yeah, no regrets though, no white flags either)
Put you through dumb shit, got you thinkin' I run shit (I ain't havin' regrets, yeah)

And it's gon' hit some
New coupe? (Ooh) Been whippin' 'em
New boobs? (Yeah) Where you get them done?

And spread you out like some Yayo (I'm naughty, yah)

That's it (Yeah), so sick (Oh)
No shit (Oh)
Damn, I'm (Yeah) getting too fuckin' old for this (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
But still as explosive with, just load the clip
Two pistols on hip, both are gripped
I hold them at shoulder width
Took a stab in the dark and broke the tip
Of my knife off, but your throat is slit
'Cause I'm cutthroat to the utmost with it
The ultimate
I just let the poker chips fall where they were supposed to fit
Now those days are over, scrapin' change in sofas
Tryna save at Kroger (Yeah)
So why would I give a fuck about backstabbin' Trader Joe for?
How 'bout that, I'm paid as Oprah
Think I may have broke the scale
'Cause the wait is over
But wait, wait, hold up, 'cause they say I almost

I almost lost it
I had to reach back, back, and lock it, yeah (Lock it, lock it)

You almost (Stop it), you almost (Stop it), you almost (Stop it), but I got it (I got it)
You almost (Stop it), you almost (Stop it), you almost (Stop it), I got it (I got it)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So sit there and act pathetic and sulk
'Cause I'm getting green, Incredible Hulk
'Cause I usually get it in bulk
But I still will stomp your head to a pulp (Yeah)
You want smoke, I got the tical like Method Man
So get ready to die from second hand
Get a whiff of the doctor's medicine
Like sedatives you'll get popped, Excedrin
'Cause you can get it like over the counter (Yo)
Like I just left the damn concession stand (Yeah)
A mic in my hand's a weapon (What?)
I put that on everything like ranch, I'll never land
I'm too fly, I don't plan to ever Cinderella Man
What I am is better than
Every single one of you
Whether separate or all of you band together
And I put the game on the pill (Yeah)
Now my Shady babies are all stillborns
Meaning abortions that live 'cause they were still born
I can heal 'em with Neosporin
You 'bout to experience euphoria
(I'm a) true warrior, got the plug like Trugoy
Give me the cue like I'm ScHoolboy
And I'll treat the beat like a pitbull would do to a chew toy and destroy it, 'cause, boy, I

I almost lost it
I had to reach back, back, and lock it, yeah (Lock it, lock it)
You almost got me (Stop it, stop it)
I had to reach back, back, and lock it, yeah (Lock it, lock it)

[Verse 1]
Where are you goin'? Can I come too?
The whole world is open, a playground for me and you
And we could be fine, shit, who the hell knows?
It's your eyes and your ears and your mouth and your nose
Head and your shoulders, your knees and your toes
I dream of this moment
Will it come true?
The whole world, they know it
They just waitin' for me and you
And she, just like I
Got her head in the clouds
Don't need to be lower
Before it's all over, I promise we'll figure it out
I ain't comin' down
Why would I need to?
So much of this world is above us, baby
They might tell you that I went crazy
I'm just tryna read you
Ooh, ooh, oohh
Ooh-ooh-oohh

I know we try
And the days, they go by
Until we get old
There's water in the flowers, let's grow
People, they lie
But hey, so do I
Until it gets old
There's water in the flowers, let's grow

[Post-Chorus]
Let it go, let it be
We're all we need today
Let it go, let it be
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

[Verse 2]
Yeah, well
Sometimes I get lonely
Not when I'm alone
But it's more when I'm standin' in crowds
That I'm feelin' the most on my own
And I know that somebody knows me
I know somewhere there's home
I'm startin' to see that all I have to do is get up and go

[Bridge]
Goin', goin', goin' before I'm gone
Gotta get goin', goin', goin' before I'm gone

[Chorus]
Ayy, and I know we try
Days, they go by
Until we get old
There's water in the flowers, let's grow
People, they lie
But hey, so do I
Until it gets old

113,Stepdad,"[Intro]
Ayo
(This a song about)
My, my stepdad
(Let's see if this ever happened to you)
I, I hate
My, my stepdad

[Verse 1]
One thing that sticks in my craw
When I was six and I saw my stepfather hittin' my Ma
Socked her right in her eyeball
I'm startin' to think I'm psychotic
With all the pictures I draw of
Shit that I've already witnessed, it’s probably twisted my thoughts
All I can hear is drama with Mom and him
I can always hear 'em arguin' down the hallways
The walls are thin so the noise is startin' to feel like the norm
Our dog pissed on the carpet, he stomped it so hard
Doctors had to put it down
He killed my chihuahua, this motherfucker!

[Chorus]
I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (Stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', ""Bye-bye stepdad"" (Stepdad)

[Verse 2]
Outside, I look like I'm calm
Inside, I'm a tickin' time bomb
'Cause of this motherfucker, who sticks his dick in my mom (My mom)
Last night, he said I left the kitchen light on
But he walked in there this morning and purposely flipped it, I saw him
Hickory switch to my bottom, I counted sixty-nine times
He swatted me with it, I'd cry
He just started hittin' me harder
God, I wish I could just jaw him
If I could get my weight up
But I'm just a second grader
This prick is bigger than I am
But I've been readin' at school about this shit called liquid cyanide
I'm fantasizin' at night when he's sleepin' at just the right time
Sneak up with a lethal injection
And put him down like they did to my dog
I'm talkin' euthanasia (Euthanasia), like kids in Taiwan
This fuckin' shit's like Saigon (Saigon)
Neighbors called police on him
So many battery charges, this dude's like lithium-ion
Then Mom and him let bygones (Bygones)
Just be bygones
So on eggshells, I walk and just try not to piss this guy off
But this is why I...

[Chorus]
I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (Stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', ""Bye-bye stepdad"" (Stepdad)

[Verse 3]
So this year, I'm goin' into the fifth and I'm tall
I'm five foot six on my block, I'm the toughest kid but I got
Way bigger fish to fry
Which is why I'm tryin' to get this bitch to fly off
The handle and wait for the fist to fly to put this guy in a pine box
He's always lookin' for chaos but tonight I've cooked up a plan
So this Christmas, I got some color books and some crayons
I'm layin' on the floor, in the living room with some friends colorin'
He walks by, kicks my arm and goes, ""Oops"" and just laughs
I yelled for Mom (Mom) and as she's rushin' to my defense
I stood up and said, ""Fuck you, punk"" and I took off and ran
To my bedroom, as I fled
Knowin' shit would hit the fan
Slammed the door and hid behind it with an aluminum bat
He kicked it in
I swung it hard as I could at his head
His noodle went splat, he fell right at the foot of my bed
I'm a little bit scared but my anger's overtooken the fear
I threw down the bat and just started whoopin' his ass
Beat him with my bare hands, the big bad wolf ain't so bad
""Ding-dong,"" the pussy is dead, the bully finally gets his
Stomped him until he pissed enough to fill a two-liter with
Then buried him next to my dog
And if I go to juvie for this, I'ma tell 'em

[Chorus]
I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (Stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', ""Bye-bye stepdad"" (Stepdad)
'Cause I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (Stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', ""Bye-bye stepdad"" (Stepdad)",Eminem,2020,[93],1

I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone

Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me

I never needed anything from you
And all I ever asked was for the truth (All I ever asked was for)
You showed your tongue and it was forked in two
Your venom was lethal, I almost believed you (Almost believed you)
Yeah, you preyed on my every mistake
Waited on me to break, held me under hopin' I would drown
Like a plague, I was wasting away
Tryna find my way out, find my way out (Find my way out)

And it finally came the day
I start giving my heart away
For Heaven's sake, my bones will break
But you'll never own my soul, no

You bled me dry just like the tears you never show

Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go

I took them stones you threw, made chains for the crew (Ice)
I brought up 10 hoes, this coupe only made for two (Yessir)
They all ran through it, it ain't nothin' left to do
I need some more reasons to live out this evening (Straight up)
I've been sippin' forever and just taking whatever
Hoping, thinking whenever you'll be back around
Let's go our ways, whichever
You say how is however long
'Cause you know I'll never be alone (Yeah)

Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go

No, you not fighting alone 'cause I'm protectin' you from 'em, so chill
Life hard and ex-lovers is like scars
'Cause it stop hurtin' but never forgettin' what it was
I was a youngin, my biggest enemy was the club
With voicemails on third rings fucking me up

Talk, let's have conversations in the dark
World is sleeping, I'm awake with you, with you
Watch movies that we've both already seen
I ain't even looking at the screen
It's true, I got my eyes on you

And you say that you're not worth it
You get hung up on your flaws
Well, in my eyes, you are perfect as you are

I won't ever try to change you, change you
I will always want the same you, same you
Swear on everything I pray to
That I won't break your heart
I'll be there when you get lonely, lonely
Keep the secrets that you told me, told me
And your love is all you owe me
And I won't break your heart

[Verse 2]
On Sunday mornings we sleep in 'til noon
Oh, I could sleep wherever next to you, next to you
And we, we got places we both gotta be
But there ain't nothing I would rather do

Is all I want too much to ask?
Is it something wrong with me?

Now happy ever after, it don't come so easily

[Chorus]
All I want is love that lasts
Is all I want too much to ask?
Is it something wrong with me? Oh, ooh
All I want is a good guy
Are my expectations far too high?
Try my best but what can I say?
All I have is myself at the end of the day
And all I want is for that to be okay",Olivia Rodrigo,2020,"[100, 90]",2

He's wanted now, dead or alive
Oh, he's a sucker for a pair of reds
A fool for their eyes
But I've heard he's a really great man
Yeah, somewhere deep down
He's a stand-up fucking man!
So if you ever find yourself inside a room for two
And this man comes up and he talks to you
Alert the town, we'll capture him quick
Alert the town, oh, he's already left

In words what happened to me on the day
He took all that he ever could- she trusted him well
Trusted him good, good, good
All at once he said to me
""You gotta keep it calmed down before it kills me!""
Before I wake up, waste my time
Got a fist full of minutes, but I'm making it right

Ah, son, pull off, pull off

Many men wish death upon me
Blood in my eye, dawg, and I can't see
I'm tryin' to be what I'm destined to be
And niggas tryin' to take my life away (C'mon)
I put a hole in a nigga for fuckin' with me
My back on the wall, now you gon' see
Better watch how you talk when you talk about me
‘Cause I'll come and take your life away

Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me

Now man, these pussy niggas puttin' money on my head
Go on and get your refund, motherfucker, I ain't dead
I'm the diamond in the dirt that ain't been found
I'm the underground king, and I ain't been crowned
When I rhyme, somethin' special happened every time
I'm the greatest, somethin' like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles
I've been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble, show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper, nigga, go 'head, lose your head
Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around, gun on my waist, chip on my shoulder
Till I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over

Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more

Sunny days wouldn't be special if it wasn't for rain
Joy wouldn't feel so good if it wasn't for pain
Death gotta be easy, ‘cause life is hard
It'll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred
This is for my niggas on the block twistin' trees in cigars
For the niggas on lock doin' life behind bars
I don't say ""Only God can judge me,"" ‘cause I see things clear
Crooked-ass crackers will give my black-ass a hundred years
I'm like Paulie in Goodfellas, you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me, let niggas ride on me
I thought we was cool, why you want me to die, homie?

Every night I talk to God, but he don't say nothin' back
I know he protectin' me, but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares, niggas keep pullin' TECs on me
Psychic says some bitch done put a hex on me
The feds didn't know much when 'Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me Tut got knocked
I ain't gon' spell it out for you mu'fuckas all the time
Are you illiterate, nigga? You can't read between the lines?
In the Bible, it says what goes around, comes around
""Hommo"" shot me, three weeks later he got shot down
Now it's clear that I'm here for a real reason
‘Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fuckin' breathin'

Bo tylko ona zna mój ulubiony film
I kuma dobrze mój popierdolony styl
Jestem wolny tylko z nią, wolny tylko z nią
Jestem wolny tylko z nią, wolny tylko z nią
Skarbie jesteś mi potrzebna, gdy nie mam się do kogo odezwać
Gdy cały ten fejm mnie przerasta
I było nie raz tak, już chciałem się chlastać
A wtedy Ty wybaczasz moje wady, wybaczasz błędy

But the fire is so delightful

But if you'll really hold me tight

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all a-glow
Will find it hard sleeping tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

And comfy cozy are we

We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a feather would be

And sing a chorus or two

For a sleigh ride together with you

At the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs
We love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace while we watch
The chestnuts pop; Pop! Pop! Pop!
There's a happy feeling
Nothing in the world can buy
When they pass around the chocolate
And the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print

These wonderful things are the things
We remember all through our lives!

But do you recall the most famous reindeer of all

Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it, you would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve Santa came to say
""Rudolph with your nose so bright, won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""
Then how the reindeer loved him as they shouted out with glee
""Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer, you'll go down in history""

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

[Verse 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

Go it while you're young
Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song
Just get a bobtailed bay
Two forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack, you'll take the lead

[Chorus]
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, hey
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh",Christmas Songs,2020,[43],1

Dum-dum-dum-dum

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
The snow on the ground, the love in the air
Sleigh bells are ringin'
This is what it's all about
The fire is warm, the angels are singin'

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas with Joe Jonas]
And I don't wanna miss a single thing
Don't wanna put end to all this cheer
But as long as you're with me
It's always the time of the year

[Chorus: Joe Jonas with Nick Jonas]
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas
Never wanna stop
Feelin' like the first thing on your wishlist
Right up at the top
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside
Nothin' fake about the way you bring me to life
You make every day feel like it's Christmas
Everyday that I'm with you

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas with Nick Jonas]
Look at the lights
Twinklin' bright 24/7
Every inch of Central Park is covered in white
This could be heaven

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas with Nick Jonas]
And I don't wanna miss a single thing
Don't wanna put end to all this cheer
But as long as you're with me
It's always the time of the year, yeah (woo!)

[Chorus: Joe Jonas with Nick Jonas, Nick Jonas]
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas (Like it's Christmas)
Never wanna stop
Feelin' like the first thing on your wishlist

Nothin' fake about the way you bring me to life
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas
Everyday that I'm with you

[Bridge: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Woo, woo, woo, yeah (Every day that I'm with you)
Every day, every night (Oh, oh, all day)

[Chorus: Joe Jonas with Nick Jonas]
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas
Never wanna stop
Feelin' like the first thing on your wishlist
Right up at the top (And I can't deny)
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside
Nothin' fake about the way you bring me to life
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas
Everyday that I'm with you

[Outro: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Hey, hey, yeah
Everyday, la-la-la
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside
No matter the reason, no matter decision
My heart will keep beatin', you better believe
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas (Like it's Christmas)
Everyday that I'm with you (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Everyday that I'm with you (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Everyday that I'm with you",Jonas Brothers,2020,[44],1
177,Baby It's Cold Outside,"[Verse 1: Marilyn Maxwell & Dean Martin]
I really can't stay (But, baby, it's cold outside)
I've got to go away (But, baby, it's cold outside)
This evening has been (Been hoping that you'd drop in)
So very nice (I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice)
My mother will start to worry (Beautiful, what's your hurry?)
My father will be pacing the floor (Listen to the fireplace roar)
So, really, I'd better scurry (Beautiful, please don't hurry)
But maybe just a half a drink more (Put some records on while I pour)
The neighbors might think (Baby, it's bad out there)
Say, what's in this drink? (No cab's to be had out there)
I wish I knew how (Your eyes are like starlight now)
To break this spell (I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)
I ought to say, ""No, no, no, sir"" (Mind if I move in closer?)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (What's the sense of hurtin' my pride?)

[Chorus: Marilyn Maxwell, Dean Martin & Both]
I really can't stay
(Oh, baby, don't hold out)
Baby, it's cold outside

[Verse 2: Marilyn Maxwell & Dean Martin]
I simply must go (But, baby, it's cold outside)
The answer is no (But, baby, it's cold outside)
Your welcome has been (How lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (Look out the window at the storm)
My sister will be suspicious (Gosh your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (Waves upon the tropical shore)
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious (Gosh your lips are delicious)
But maybe just a cigarette more (Never such a blizzard before)
I've gotta get home (But, baby, you'd freeze out there)
Say, lend me a coat (It's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand (I thrill when you touch my hand)
But don't you see? (How can you do this thing to me?)
There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Think of my lifelong sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied (If you got pneumonia and died)

[Chorus: Marilyn Maxwell, Dean Martin & Both]
I really can't stay
(Get over that cold out)
Baby, it's cold
Baby, it's cold outside",Dean Martin,2020,[45],1
178,"You're A Mean One, Mr. Grinch","[Verse 1]
You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
You really are a heel
You're as cuddly as a cactus, you're as charming as an eel, Mr. Grinch
You're a bad banana with a greasy black peel!

[Verse 2]
You're a monster, Mr. Grinch
Your heart's an empty hole
Your brain is full of spiders, you've got garlic in your soul, Mr. Grinch
I wouldn't touch you with a thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole!

[Verse 3]
You're a vile one, Mr. Grinch
You have termites in your smile
You have all the tender sweetness of a seasick crocodile, Mr. Grinch
Given a choice between the two of you I'd take the seasick crocodile!

[Verse 4]
You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch
You're a nasty-wasty skunk
Your heart is full of unwashed socks, your soul is full of gunk, Mr. Grinch
The three words that best describe you are as follows, and I quote
""Stink, stank, stunk!""

[Verse 5]
You're a rotter, Mr. Grinch
You're the king of sinful sots
Your heart's a dead tomato splotched with moldy purple spots, Mr. Grinch
Your soul is an appalling dump heap overflowing with the most disgraceful
Assortment of deplorable rubbish imaginable, mangled up in tangled up knots!

[Verse 6]
You nauseate me, Mr. Grinch
With a nauseous super ""naus""!
You're a crooked dirty jockey and you drive a crooked hoss, Mr. Grinch
You're a three decker sauerkraut and toadstool sandwich with arsenic sauce!",Dr. Seuss,2020,[49],1

180,Hate Me,"[Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
Hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me

[Verse 1: Ellie Goulding]
I bet you don't kiss her with your eyes closed
I bet you're still walkin' on a tightrope
Miss me so much, you've been goin' psycho
You ain't gotta say it, baby, I know

[Pre-Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
It's a thin line between all this love and hate
And if you switch sides, you're gon' have to claim your place
So baby, this time you're gon' have to seal your fate
Yeah baby, this time you're gon' have to seal your fate

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
And tell me how you hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me

Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me

[Verse 2: Juice WRLD]
Hate me, hate me, tell me how you hate me
Tell me how I'm trash and you could easily replace me
Tell me that I'm strung out, wasted on the daily
Prolly 'cause there's no one around me numbin' all my pain
Prolly 'cause there's no umbrella to shield me from all the rain
Probably because you're the one playin' the mind games
You hate me because I don't let you play no mind games
They give me migraines and damage my brain
Date me, break me, easily replace me
Hopefully you see it clear, hopefully it's HD
Bet you wonder why the last few months I've been spacey
In your head, I sing...

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding with Juice WRLD]
And tell me how you hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me
Hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me

It's a thin line between all this love and hate (Okay)
And if you switch sides, you're gon' have to claim your place (Okay)

Yeah baby, this time you're gon' have to seal your fate (Okay)
