To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left (Mmm)

[Verse 1]
To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet, that's my stuff
Yes, if I bought it, please don't touch (Don't touch)
And keep talking that mess that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time
And, it's my name that's on that jag
So remove your bags, let me call you a cab

[Pre-Chorus]
Standing in the front yard
Tellin' me, how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout, how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

[Chorus]
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

[Verse 2]
So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought, that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for?
'Cause you was untrue
Rollin' her around in the car that I bought you
Baby, drop them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves

[Pre-Chorus]
Standing in the front yard
Tellin' me, how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout, how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

[Chorus]
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I will have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable (Irreplaceable)

[Bridge]
So since I'm not your everything (Irreplaceable)
How about I'll be nothing (Nothing)
Nothing at all to you (Nothing)
Baby, I won't shed a tear for you (I won't shed a tear)
I won't lose a wink of sleep
'Cause the truth of the matter is
Replacing you was so easy

[Interlude]
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left (Mmm)
To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
To the left, to the left
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

[Chorus]
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking (Baby)
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute
You can pack all your bags (You must not know about me)
We're finished (You must not know about me)
'Cause you made your bed
Now lay in it
I can have another you by tomorrow
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking

Shorty, I can see you ain’t lonely
Handful of niggease and they all got cheese
See you lookin’ at me now what its gon’ be
Just another tease far as I can see
Tryna get you up out this club
If it means spendin' a couple dubs
Throwin’ bout 30 stacks in the back make it rain like that

And you know my pedigree
Ex-deala use to move amphetamines
Girl I spend money like it don’t mean nothing and besides I got a thing for you

I see you windin’ and grindin’ up on the floor
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you... you already know
I wanna love you... you already know, girl

[Snoop Dogg]
Mobbin' through the club and I’m low pressin’
I’m sittin’ in the back in the smoker’s section (just smokin’)
Birds eye, I got a clear view
You can’t see me, but I can see you (baby I see you)
Hmm, it’s cool, we jet, the mood is set, your pussy is wet
You’re rubbin’ your back and touchin’ your neck
Your body is movin', you humpin' and jumpin'
Your titties is bouncin', you smilin' and grinnin' and lookin’ at me

[Akon]
Girl and while your lookin' at me I’m ready to hit the caddy
Right up on the patio move the patty to the caddy
Baby you got a phatty, the type I like to marry
Wantin’ to just give you everything and that’s kinda scary
Cause I'm loving the way you shake your ass
Bouncin', got me tippin' my glass
Normally don’t get caught up too fast
But I got a thing for you

[Hook]
I see you windin’ and grindin’ up on the floor
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna love you... you already know

Shady, Konvict, Upfront
Akon, Slim Shady
I see the one, could she be that lady? Ayy

[Chorus: Akon]
I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?
Look back and watch me
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1: Akon]
Upfront style, ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the 'Lac down
Konvict's got the whole thing packed now
Step in the club and wardrobe intact now
I feel it, dawnin' cracked now
Ooh, I see it dull and backed now
I'ma call her, then I put the mack down
Money no problem, pocket full of that now

[Chorus: Akon]
I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Oh, looks like another club banger
They better hang on when they throw this thang on
Get a little drink on, they gon' flip
For this Akon shit, you can bank on it
Pedicure, manicure, kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Lookin' like one of them Putty-Cat Dolls
Tryin' to hold my woodie back through my drawers
Steps upstage, didn't think I saw her
Creeps up behind me, and she's like ""You're —""
I'm like, ""I know, let's cut to the chase""
No time to waste, back to my place
Plus from the club to the crib, it's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
And plus, I got a pal if your gal is game
In fact, he's the one singin' the song that's playin' (Akon!)

[Chorus: Akon]
I feel you creepin', I can you see from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?
Look back and watch me
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oooh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-oooh

Eminem's rollin', D and 'em rollin'
Bu and all marvelous, them rollin'
Women just ho-in', big booty rollin'
Soon, I'll be all in them and throwin' D (D)
Hittin' no less than three (Three)
Block wheel style like whee (Whee)
Girl, I can tell you want me, because lately

I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo?
And possibly bend you over?

Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my—

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me (What would you do?)
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular? (Tell me, would you?)
Well, baby, I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl (Like you)
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you (Saying ""I do"")
Because

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sittin' on the grass, layin' side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot
My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot, my love
Love, girl, my love, my love

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Now If I wrote you a love note
And made you smile at every word I wrote (What would you do?)
Would that make you wanna change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team? (Tell me, would you?)
See, what's the point in waitin' anymore?
'Cause girl, I've never been more sure (That, baby, it's you)
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you been waitin' for (Just say it, ""I do"")
Because

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sittin' on the grass, layin' side by side

Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love (So don't give away)

Ay, ay, ay

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Shawty cool as a fan, on the move once again (Ay)
But he still has fans from Peru to Japan
Hey, listen, baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan (Nah)
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can
'Cause the girls worldwide throw they hands up high
When you wanna come and kick it with a stand-up guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen with a man so fly
And, babe, with friends so fly, I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle my B.I
They call me Candle Guy (Why?)
Simply 'cause I am on fire (Haha)
I hate to have to cancel my vacation, so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gon' try (Nah)
You don't come, I ain't gon' die
Hold up, what you mean you can't go? Why? (Why?)
Me and your boyfriend, we ain't no tie (Uh-huh)
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high (Man)
Baby, it's obvious that I ain't yo' guy
I ain't gon' lie, I'll fill your space
And forget your face, I swear I will
St. Barths, Anguilla, anywhere I chill (Nice)
Just bring with me any pair, I will (C'mon)

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand

From my hands I could give you
Something that I made
From my mouth, I could sing you another brick that I laid
From my body, I could show you a place God knows
You should know the space is holy
Do you really wanna go?

[Intro]
I wear a mean dark pair of shades
And you can't see my eyes
Unless my head is bent, you dig

[Hook]
We fly high, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Foreign rides outside, it's like showbiz (we in the building)
We stay fly, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused

[Verse 1]
Ya boy gettin' paper (money), I buy big cars (foreign)
I need fly rides to drive in my garage (choose one!)
Stay sky high, twisted, fly with the stars (twinkle, twinkle)
G4 Flights, 80 grand large (ballin'!)
So we lean with it, pop with it (Bankhead)
'Vertible Jones, mean with the top missin' (flossin'!)
I'm sittin' clean with the bottom kitted (do it!)
I hopped out saggy jeans and my rock glistenin' (ballin'!)
But I spent 'bout 8 grand
Mami on stage doin' the rain dance (I think she like me)
She let it hit the floor, made it pop (what else?)
Got my pedal to the floor screamin', ""Fuck the cops!""

[Hook]
We fly high, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Foreign rides outside, it's like showbiz (we in the building)
We stay fly, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused

[Verse 2]
Slow down, tonight may be gone tomorrow (one chance)
So I speed through life like there's no tomorrow (speedin'!)
100 G's worth of ice on the Audemars (flossin'!)
And we in the street life 'til they call the law (ballin'!)
I made the whip get naked (what happened?)
While I switch gears, bitch lookin' at the bracelet
Step out, show me what you all about
Flashbacks of last night of me ballin' out (Harlem!)
1 AM we was at the club (what happened?)
2 AM: ten bottles of bub (money ain't a thing)
And 'bout 3-somethin' I was thinkin' 'bout grub
So I stumbled to the car, threw the drinks and the drugs (twisted)

[Hook]
We fly high, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Foreign rides outside, it's like showbiz (we in the building)
We stay fly, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused

[Verse 3]
Nigga, could you buy that? I keep 20 in the pocket (light change)
Talk a buck 80 if the Bentley is the topic (that Grey Poupon)
But of course got a Flying Spur
To the hood to roll dice on the side of the curb
But I know a G a bet may sound absurd (get your money up!)
Drive 80 up Lenox 'cause I got a urge (speedin'!)
The rap game like the crack game
Lifestyles, rich and famous, livin' in the fast lane (ballin'!)
So when I bleep, shorty bleep back
Lou' Vuitton belt where I'ma keep all the heat strapped
I beat the trial over Rucker (let's do it!)
All guns loaded and I'm back, motherfucker (Dipset)

[Hook]
We fly high, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Foreign rides outside, it's like showbiz (we in the building)
We stay fly, no lie, you know this (ballin'!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused

[Outro]
You niggas need to stay focused
When you're dealin' with a motherfuckin' G
You know my name, Jones, One Eye, Capo Status
All the above, motherfucka
This Dipset, ByrdGang, we born to fly
Y'all know the rules: fall back or fall back
Someone tell my bitch Summer I'm lookin' for her

7,How To Save A Life,"Step one, you say, ""We need to talk.""
He walks, you say, ""Sit down. It's just a talk.""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
Pray to God, he hears you
And I pray to God, he hears you

And where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness

Lay-od-lay-od-low

[Chorus]
Wind it up
Wind it up
Wind it up
Wind it up
Yodellay, yodallay, yodel-low (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
This is the key that makes us wind up
When the beat comes on, the girls all line up
And the boys all look, but no, they can't touch
But the girls want to know why boys like us so much
They like way we dance, they like the way we work
They like the way that L.A.M.B. is going 'cross my shirt
They like the way my pants, it compliments my shape (She's crazy, right?)
They like the way we react every time we hear the...

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time the bass bangs, realize it calls your name
Let the beat wind you up, and don't stop 'til your time is up
(Get in line now)

[Chorus]
Wind it up
Wind it up (C'mon)
Wind it up
Yodelay, yodelay, yodal-low

[Verse 2]
You've got to let the beat get under your skin
You've got to open up and let it all in
But see, once it gets in, the popping begins
Then you find out why all the boys stare
See, they're trying to bite our style
Trying to study our approach
They like the way we do it, so original
I guess that they are slow, so they should leave the room
This beat is for the clubs and cars that go

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time the bass bangs, realize it calls your name
Let the beat wind you up, and don't stop 'til your time is up
(Get in line now)

(Uh-huh) come on girl, you know you own it
(Uh-huh) you know your key is still tick-tocking
(Hell yeah) but you know they're watching
Get it girl, get it, get it girl
Get it girl, get it, get it girl
To the front, to the side, to the back, but don't let him ride
Keep going girl, it's your night
Don't let him steal your light
I know he thinks you're fine and stuff
But does he know how to wind you up? (C'mon)

Ayy, pull up in the coupe, let it drop, top go missin' (Ayy)
Ain't worried 'bout a bitch, I'm only worry 'bout them digits

Hear 'em talking shit but I don't really give a damn (Nah)
I been goin' up, I swear I'm feelin' like the man (Ooh)
I been goin' up and I don't think I'll ever land
Big bands on me, fuck about a ho (What?)
Always bounce back, you won't ever see me fold (Nah)

Now I'm 'bout to pop off, I think that I'm 'bout to blow
Oh no, what you even mean? (Huh?)
Hatin' on the boy, god damn, you a fiend (You a fiend)
Fiendin' for attention but you ain't gonna get none
Five star plate and I like my steak well done
Bitch, you know I'm cookin' up, got 'em shooken up
They was lookin' down on me, now they lookin' up
Gettin' to a bag, what you think, I'ma run it up
If I'm on the dancefloor you know I'ma fuck it up
Ayy, had to go and hit 'em with the moves real quick (Ooh)
Brand new kicks and they match with the fit (Ooh)
Oh shit, I'm lit, I think I just made a hit (Yeah)
They ain't really see it coming 'cause I did it so quick
Skater boy, bitch, I feel like Eric Koston (What?)
I'm so fly, feel like I'm up in the cockpit (What?)
Got no time on my grind, I ain't stoppin' (What?)
Bitches on my dick 'cause they know the boy poppin' (Aha)
Whoa, hold up, drop it down, get low
Always- always on the move but you know I tiptoe (Tiptoe)
Always up to something but I keep it on the low
Got too much sauce like I work at Domino's
Y'all cheesy, bitch, I got the keys like Stevie
Pink like watermelon, green like a kiwi
I gotta get it done, feelin' like a Meeseeks
They was hatin' on me, now they wishin' they could be me

19,Far Away,"[Intro: Chris Richardson]
Walk a thousand miles
Just to see her (see her)

[Hook: Chris Richardson]
But she’s far, far away
And I’d do anything just to see her face
But she’s far, far away
Walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Sittin’ on a plane
Reminscing back when I made that mistake
I wish it never ended with a heartbreak
Now your heart broken, tears in ya face
Ask myself why, looking at the sky
If I could turn back I’d make it all right
Praying that you better but its still stormy weather
Don’t wanna let go but the rain won't let up
Now you gone, still thinking bout you everyday
And I know feelings was hurt and you can blame me but
I’m sorry for the games that I played
But now it’s too late
And now she’s…

[Hook: Chris Richardson]
But she’s far, far away
And I’d do anything just to see her face
But she’s far, far away
Walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again

[Verse 2: Tyga]
It’s cold putting up a fight
Arguing back and forth through the night
Regardless what I said I don’t mean most of it
You know I really love you, this the realest goin’ get
It take time to realize what you really wanna know
You was ready for it all but your feelings I ignored
I know my fault, I should’ve gave more
Now you’re miles away and I’m miles on tour
Now it’s drums playing, crowd singing
Life changing, wish you was here to witness all
Now that starts fading
They say two wrongs don’t make it right
And I was wrong and now it ain't right

[Hook: Chris Richardson]
But she’s far, far away
And I’d do anything just to see her face
But she’s far, far away
Walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again

Na na na nah

If I could make it right

20,Hurt,"[Produced by Rick Rubin]

[Verse 1]
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

[Verse 2]
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

[Chorus]
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

21,Walk Away (Remember Me),"[Intro: Paula DeAnda & Divine from The D.E.Y.]
I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me
(I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me
(Yeah, I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)

[Verse 1: Divine from The D.E.Y.]
Yeah, you gonna remember me, boo
I'm gonna remember you too
I can't forget all the crazy shit we used to do
You was doing too much, I wasn't doing enough
That's what your friends are saying, you got a man anyway
I can't explain it either, I ain't never wanna leave ya
Hell yeah, it's hard to walk away when I see ya
When I see ya I remember the day
You put your shoes on and moved on before I could say...

[Verse 2: Paula DeAnda]
I saw you with your new girl just yesterday
And I feel that I must confess
Even though it kills me to have to say
I'll admit that I was impressed
Physically just short of perfection
Gotta commend you on your selection
Though I know I shouldn't be concerned
In the back of my mind, I can't help but question
Does she rub your feet? (When you've had a long day)
Scratch your scalp? (When you take out your braids)
Does she know that you like to play PS2 'til 6 in the morning like I do?

[Chorus: Paula DeAnda & Divine]
I can't explain this feeling (Yeah)
I think about it every day
And even though we've moved on (Uh-huh)
It gets so hard to walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
Walk away (Forever you will live in my memory)
Walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
Walk away (I can't forget how we used to be)

[Verse 3: Paula DeAnda]
Guess I gotta live my life from day to day
Hoping maybe you'll come back
And though I tell myself not to be afraid
To move on, but it seems I can't
Though a new man has given me attention
It ain't the same as your affection
Though I know I should be content
In the back of my mind, I can't help but question
Does he kiss me on the forehead? (Before we play)
Show up on my doorstep? (With a bouquet)
Does he call me in the middle of the day just to say, ""Baby, I love you"" (Like you used to?)

[Chorus: Paula DeAnda & Divine]
I can't explain this feeling (Yeah)
I think about it every day
And even though we've moved on (Uh-huh)
It gets so hard to walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
Walk away (Forever you will live in my memory)
Walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
Walk away (I can't forget how we used to be)

[Verse 4: Divine, Paula DeAnda, Both]
I'm gonna remember you (You're gonna remember me)
The things we did, the way we shared our fantasies
Just you and me; my friend, my love, my family
How did we lose a love that seemed meant to be?
Sometimes I kiss her and wish that it was you I'm kissing
Sometimes I miss him and wish that it was you I'm missing
Sometimes I hug her and wish that it was you I was hugging
And I realize how much I'm bugging
I miss you

[Bridge: Paula DeAnda & Divine]
So hard to express this feeling
'Cause nobody compares to you (To you)
And you know she'll never love you like I do (Yeah)

[Chorus: Paula DeAnda, Divine, Both]
I can't explain this feeling (Uh-uh)
I think about it every day (Yeah)
And even though we've moved on (Yeah)
It gets so hard to walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me) (Walk away)
Walk away (Walk away)
Walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me) (I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, no...)
I can't explain this feeling (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
I think about it every day (Forever you will live in my memory)
And even though we've moved on (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
It gets so hard to walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)
Walk away (Forever you will live in my memory) (?)

22,Before He Cheats,"[Verse 1]
Right now, he's probably slow dancing
With a bleached-blond tramp
And she's probably getting frisky
Right now, he's probably buying her some fruity little drink
'Cause she can't shoot whiskey
Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool-stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know

[Chorus]
I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

[Verse 2]
Right now, she's probably up singing some
White-trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now, she's probably saying, ""I'm drunk""
And he's a thinking that he's gonna get lucky
Right now, he's probably dabbing on
Three dollars worth of that bathroom polo
Oh, and he don't know

[Chorus]
Oh, that I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

I might've saved a little trouble for the next girl
'Cause the next time that he cheats

Already woke, spared a joke, barely spoke, rarely smoke
Stared at folks when properly provoked, mirror broke
Here, share strawberry morning, gone an more important spawning
Torn in, poor men sworn in
Cornish hens switching positions, auditioning morticians
Saw it in a vision, ignoring prison
Ignoramuses enlist and sound dumb
Found 'em drowned in cow's dung, crowns flung
Rings a Tinkerbell, sing for things that's frail as a fingernail
Bring a scale, stale ginger lingers
Seven figures invigor
Nigga, fresh from out the jail, alpha male
Sickest ninja injury this century, enter plea
Lend sympathy to limper Simple Simon rhyming emcees
Trees is free, please leave a key
These meagre fleas, he's the breeze
And she's the bees knees for sheez
G's of G's
Seize property, shopper sprees, chop the cheese
Drop the grease to stop diseases, gee wiz pa!
DOOM rock grammar like the kumbaya
Mama was a ho hopper, papa was a Rolling Stone star like Obama
Pull a card like oh drama
Civil liberties
These little titties abilities riddle me, middle C
Give a MC a rectal hysterectomy
Lecture on removal of the bowels, foul technically
Don't expect to see the recipe
Until we receive the check as well as the collection fee
More wreck than Section Z
What you expect to get for free?
Shit from me, history
The key, plucked it off the mayor
Chucked it in the ol' tar pit off La Brea, player
They say he's gone too far
DOOM'll catch em after Jumah on cue lacka!!
Do whatcha gotta do, grarrrr
The rumors are not true, got two ma
No prob, got the job, hot-barred heart throb
Scotchguard the bar with cotton swabs, dart lob
Bake a cake, sweet
Jamaica trade in treats on the beach
Make her skeet til her feets meet

Can it be I stayed away too long?
Did you miss these rhymes when I was gone?
As you listen to these crazy tracks
Check them stats then you know where I'm at
And that's that

The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead

We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate

And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

26,Welcome To The Black Parade,"When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned?""

He said, ""Will you defeat them?
Your demons and all the non-believers
The plans that they have made?
Because one day, I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer
To join the black parade""

When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned?""

Sometimes I get the feeling
She's watching over me
And other times I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall
The bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know

We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And in my heart, I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it

And while that sends you reeling
From decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back
And let's shout out loud and clear
Defiant to the end we hear the call

To carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

On and on we carry through the fears (Oh, oh, oh)
Disappointed faces of your peers (Oh, oh, oh)
Take a look at me
'Cause I could not care at all

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part

I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scar
Give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here because it's who we are

I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy who had to sing this song
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
I don't care

We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, you'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches on

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
(We'll carry on)

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart

And I don't wanna see you cry
But I don't wanna be the one to tell you a lie so

[Pre-Chorus]
How do you let it go when you, you just don't know

[Chorus]
There's never a right time to say goodbye (Yeah)
But I gotta make the first move
'Cause if I don't you gonna start hating me
'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl, it's not you, it's me, I
Kinda gotta figure out what I need, oh
There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go our separate ways
And I know it's hard but I gotta do it and it's killing me
'Cause there's never a right time, right time to say goodbye

[Verse 2]
Girl, I know your heart is breaking
And a thousand times I found myself asking, ""Why? Why?""

Thought I would see the day we grew apart
And I wanna know

[Pre-Chorus]
How do you let it go when you, you just don't know

Listen to your heart, girl, you know
We should be apart, baby I

28,Waiting On The World To Change,"[Verse 1]
Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing and
There's no way we ever could
Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it

[Chorus]
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change

[Verse 2]
Now if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
But when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
Because when they own the information, oh
They can bend it all they want

[Chorus]
That's why we're waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
It's not that we don't care
We just know that the fight isn't fair
So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
And we're still waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting, waiting on the world to change
One day our generation
Is going to rule the population
So we keep on waiting

29,Make It Rain,"[Verse 1]
When the sins of my father
Weigh down in my soul
And the pain of my mother
Will not let me go
Well, I know there can come fire from the sky
To refine the purest of kings
And even though I know this fire brings me pain
Even so, and just the same

[Chorus]
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Make it rain

[Verse 2]
Well, a seed needs the water
'Fore it grows out of the ground
But it just keeps on getting hard
Hunger more profound
Well, I know they can't count tears from the eye
But they may as well all be in vain
And even though I know these tears come with pain
Even so, and just the same

[Chorus]
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Just make it rain
Make it rain

[Verse 3]
Well, the seas are full of water
Stops by the shore
It's like the riches of grandeur, oh no
Never reach the poor
And let the clouds fill with thunderous applause
And let lightning be the veins
But fill the sky with all that they can draw
When it's time to make a change

[Chorus (Extended)]
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain

Make it rain down, lord

30,Runaway Love,"[Intro]
Yeah, and it go a little somethin'
Li-li-like this

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Now little Lisa's only nine years old
She's tryin to figure out why the world is so cold
Why she's all alone and they never met her family
Momma's always gone and she never met her daddy
Part of her is missin and nobody'll listen
Momma's on drugs gettin high up in the kitchen
Bringin home men at different hours of the night
Startin with some laughs, usually endin in a fight
Sneakin in her room when her momma's knocked out
Tryin to have his way and little Lisa says ouch
She tries to resist but then all he does is beat her
Tries to tell her mom but her momma don't believe her
Lisa's stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get some clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and never come back (Like this)

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Little Nicole is only ten years old
She's steady tryin to figure why the world is so cold
Why she's not pretty and nobody seems to like her
Alcoholic stepdad always wanna strike her
Yells and abuses, leaves her with some bruises
Teachers ask questions, she's makin up excuses
Bleedin on the inside, cryin on the out
It's only one girl really knows what she's about
Her name is little Stacy and they become friends
Promise that they'll always be tight 'til the end
Until one day lil' Stacy gets shot
A drive-by bullet went stray up on her block
Now Nicole's stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get her clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and NEVER come back

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Little Erica is eleven years old
She's steady tryin to figure why the world is so cold
So she pops X to get rid of all the pain
Plus she's havin sex with her boy who's sixteen
Emotions run deep as she thinks she's in love
So there's no protection, he's usin no glove
Never thinkin 'bout the consequences of her actions
Livin for today and not tomorrow's satisfaction
The days go by and her belly gets big
The father bails out, he ain't ready for a kid
Knowin her momma would blow it all out of proportion
Plus she lives poor so no money for abortion
Erica is stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get her clothes and pack
She says she 'bout to run away and NEVER come back, ah!

And I read those pages, do you really love me, baby
Some things don't work
Some things are bound to be
Some things, they hurt
And they tear apart me
But I broke my word, and you were bound to see
And I cried at the curb
When you first said ""Oel ngati kameie""

[Chorus]
Hold on, wait a minute (Oh)
Feel my heart's intention
Hold on, wait a minute
I left my consciousness in the sixth dimension
Left my soul in his vision

Let's go get it, oh, oh

Some people like to live
Some just tryin' to get by
Some people I can't hurt
Some just rather say goodbye, bye

[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
Yep, yep, yep, yep
Let me paint this picture for you, baby

[Verse: Justin Timberlake]
You spend your nights alone and he never comes home
And every time you call him, all you get's a busy tone
I heard you found out that he's doin' to you
What you did to me, ain't that the way it goes?
When you cheated, girl, my heart bleeded, girl
So it goes without sayin' that you left me feelin' hurt
Just a classic case, a scenario
Tale as old as time, girl, you got what you deserved

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And now you want somebody (Hey)
To cure the lonely nights (Hey)
You wish you had somebody (Hey)
That could come and make it right (Hey)
But girl, I ain't somebody (Hey)
With a lot of sympathy (Hey)
You'll see, see

I could stay awake just to hear you breathin'
Watch you smile while you are sleeping

I could stay lost in this moment forever
Where every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure

Don't want to close my eyes
I don't want to fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you (even when I dream)

I like how you behave
But baby, I'm about to drown

40,Through Glass,"[Chorus]
I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
Oh, God, it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
That forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head
'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
All I know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
That forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head

[Verse 1]
How do you feel? That is the question
But I forget you don't expect an easy answer
When something like a soul becomes initialized and folded up
Like paper dolls and little notes, you can't expect a bit of hope
So while you're outside looking in, describing what you see
Remember what you're staring at is me

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
All I know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
That forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head

[Verse 2]
How much is real? So much to question
An epidemic of the mannequins, contaminating everything
We thought came from the heart, but never did right from the start
Just listen to the noises, null and void instead of voices
Before you tell yourself, it's just a different scene
Remember it's just different from what you've seen

[Chorus]
I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
And all I know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
That forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head
'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
And all I know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
That forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head

And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that

Is a letter that you never read

And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place""

I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That don’t bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
I’m not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though goin' on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I’m okay
But that’s not what gets me

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin' so much to say
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowing
What could've been
And not seein' that love in you
Is what I was tryin’ to do

[Verse 2]
It’s hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I’m doin’ It
It’s hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I’m alone
Still harder
Gettin' up, gettin' dressed, livin’ with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken

What hurts the most

Bought more jewelry, more Louis V
My mama couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel man
I ain't one of the Cosby's, I ain't go to Hillman
I guess the money should've changed him
I guess I should've forgot where I came from

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Let up the suicide doors
This is my life homie, you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldn't tell ya who decide wars
So I parallel double parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking 'bout, ""Back in my day""
But homie this is my day
Class started 2 hours ago, oh am I late?
No, I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh they so sensitive
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon' end up apolog'ing
Let me know if it's a problem then, aight man, holla then

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past
He don't even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors, he can drive off of fumes 'cause
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure, what's your pleasure?
Life is a, UH, depending how you dress her
So if the Devil wear Prada, Adam Eve wear nada
I'm in between but way more fresher
With way less effort, 'cause when you try hard
That's when you die hard
Your homies looking like why God
When they reminisce over you, my God

[Hook: Kanye (w/ Young Jeezy)]
La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?

You can't tell me nothing

Were in my life just to get high on

And I do believe that we rely on
When I lay it on, come get to play it on

Before I get my chance to ride
When it's killing me, what do I really need
All that I need to look inside?

And there's nowhere to go

50,Unappreciated,"(Chorus:)
I'm feeling really unappreciated
You takin' my love for granted, babe
I don't know how much more
I can take from you
You don't do the things you use to do
You don't even say I love you too
And lately I've been feeling
Feeling unappreciated

(Verse 1:)
Woke up this morning and saw your face
And you didn't look the same as yesterday
I got the feeling that you can't seem to see
What you want to be
And lately it ain't been the same at all
When you're here its like I'm invisable
I still can't seem to see where I went wrong
Cuz I'm feeling

You don't even say I love you too
And lately I've been feeling
Feeling unappreciated

(Verse 2:)
Lately our house is not a home
You come in, take a shower and then say I'm gone
What am I to do
With my heart just leave
But my feet won't move
Today is our anniversary
But you haven't even say two words to me
I'm trying hard to give you another chance
But ooh baby I'm feeling

I'm feeling really unappreciated
You takin' my love for granted, babe
I don't know how much more
I can take from you
You don't do the things you use to do
You don't even say I love you too
And lately I've been feeling
Feeling unappreciated

(Verse 3:)
Oh when I first met you
I thought you was the most perfect man
That I ever seen
I still don't understand why
You treat me like you do
I use to give into your lust
Now I see the truth
Oh no I don't want to hear it all through
Yea I know I'll still be missing you
But it's not worth the pain
That came from you
You made me feel
Unappreciated

(Chorus:)
I'm feeling really unappreciated
You takin' my love for granted, babe
I don't know how much more
I can take from you

Okay, show me what you got babe
Words is slurring, engine purring

Mami in the zone like the homie two-three
Jordan or James, makes no difference
We all ballin' the same
Nigga, I am the Mike Jordan of recordin'
Nigga, you might want to fall back from recordin'
What you write is not important
So it forced him to go for the hype
For being brave they may applaud him
But misery, I will assure them
Aww baby, just ignore them
Truth or dare, mami, listen and learn
I got a drop, I just took off the top, it's your turn

Gimme some head, gimme some brain
Gimme your number, gimme your name
But if I get one night baby girl, I swear
I'll make you tell these other dudes gimme got you here
I'll take you shopping, take long trips
I'll take the cork off, you can take sips
I'll take you there, take my time
Take your clothes off, you take off mine
Ma, show me what you got
Hovi in the spot, tried to told you I was hot
Tell these other dudes it's a wrap
Get the fuck out the throne you clone, the King's back!

They see me mowin' my front lawn
I know they're all thinking I'm so white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Can't you see I'm white and nerdy?
Look at me, I'm white and nerdy
I wanna roll with the gangstas
But so far they all think I'm too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
I'm just too white and nerdy
Really, really white and nerdy

[Verse 1]
First in my class here at MIT
Got skills, I'm a champion at D&D
M.C. Escher—that's my favorite ""M.C.""
Keep your 40, I'll just have an Earl Grey tea
My rims never spin, to the contrary
You'll find that they're quite stationary
All of my action figures are cherry
Stephen Hawking's in my library
My MySpace page is all totally pimped out
Got people beggin' for my Top 8 spaces
Yo, I know pi to a thousand places
Ain't got no grills, but I still wear braces
I order all of my sandwiches with mayonnaise
I'm a whiz at Minesweeper—I could play for days
Once you see my sweet moves, you're gonna stay amazed
My fingers movin' so fast I'll set the place ablaze
There's no killer app  I haven't run
At Pascal, well, I'm number one
Do vector calculus just for fun
I ain't got a gat but I got a soldering gun
""Happy Days"" is my favorite theme song
I could sure kick your butt in a game of ping pong
I'll ace any trivia quiz you bring on
I'm fluent in JavaScript as well as Klingon
(Here's the part I sing on)

[Chorus 2]
They see me roll on my Segway
I know in my heart they think I'm white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Can't you see I'm white and nerdy?
Look at me, I'm white and nerdy
I'd like to roll with the gangstas
Although it's apparent I'm too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
I'm just too white and nerdy
How'd I get so white and nerdy?

[Verse 2]
I've been browsin', inspectin'
X-Men comics, you know I collect 'em
The pens in my pocket, I must protect 'em
My ergonomic keyboard never leaves me bored
Shopping online for deals on some writable media
I edit Wikipedia
I memorized Holy Grail really well
I can recite it right now and have you ""ROTFLOL""
I got a business doing websites
When my friends need some code, who do they call?
I do HTML for 'em all, even made a homepage for my dog, yo
I got myself a fanny pack
They were havin' a sale down at The Gap
Spend my nights with a roll of bubble wrap
Pop, pop, hope no one sees me, gettin' freaky
I'm nerdy in the extreme and whiter than sour cream
I was in AV Club and Glee Club and even the Chess Team
Only question I ever thought was hard
Was do I like Kirk or do I like Picard?
Spend every weekend at the Renaissance Fair
Got my name on my underwear

[Chorus 3]
They see me strollin', they laughin'
And rollin' their eyes 'cause I'm so white and nerdy
Just because I'm white and nerdy
Just because I'm white and nerdy
All because I'm white and nerdy
Holy cow, I'm white and nerdy!
I wanna bowl with the gangstas
But, oh well, it's obvious I'm white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
I'm just too white and nerdy
Look at me, I'm white and nerdy!",“Weird Al” Yankovic,2006,"[55, 57, 55, 42, 36, 26, 23, 17, 15, 11, 9, 28]",12

[Intro: will.i.am & Nas]
Hip hop, hip hop (Ugh!) is dead
(Had to flip this track again, y'all!)
Hip, hip hop, hip hop (Ugh!) is dead
Hip, hip hop (Ugh!)
Hip, hip hop is dead (NYC! Dirty South!)
Hip, hip hop (West Coast!)
Hip hop (Midwest!)
Hip hop (Let's go!)

[Hook: Nas & will.i.am]
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll load an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
(Hip hop just died this morning
And she's dead, she's dead)

[Verse 1: Nas]
Yeah, niggas smoke, chill, party and die in the same corner
Get cash, live fast, body their man's mama
Quick fast, trigger fingers on the llama
Revenge in their eyes, Hennessy and the ganja
Word to the wise with villain state of minds
Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind
Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind
(Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind)
Whenever, if ever, I roll up, it's sown up
Any ghetto will tell ya, ""Nas helped grow us up""
My face once graced promotional Sony trucks
Hundred million and billin', I helped blow 'em up
Gave my man my right, I could have went left
So like my girl Foxy, the kid went deaf
So people, who's your top 10? Is it MC Shan? Is it MC Ren?

[Hook: Nas & will.i.am]
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll load an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
(Hip hop just died this morning
And she's dead, she's dead)

[Verse 2: Nas]
The bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin'
Come through, something ill, missing the ceilin'
What influenced my raps? Stick-ups and killings
Kidnappings, project buildings, drug dealings
Criticize that, why's that?
‘Cause Nas rap is compared to legitimized crap
‘Cause we love to talk on nasty chickens
Most intellectuals will only half listen
So you can't blame jazz musicians
Or David Stern with his NBA fashion issues
Oh, I think they like me, in my white tee
You can't ice me, we here for life, B
On my second marriage, hip hop's my first wifey
And for that, we not taking it lightly
If hip hop should die, we die together
Bodies in the morgue lie together, all together now

[Hook: Nas & will.i.am]
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll load an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
(Hip hop just died this morning
And she's dead, she's dead)

[Verse 3: Nas]
Everybody sound the same, commercialize the game
Reminiscing when it wasn't all business
It forgot where it started
So we all gather here for the dearly departed
Hip-hopper since a toddler
One homeboy became a man, then a mobster
If it dies, let me get my last swig of vodka
RIP, we'll donate your lungs to a rasta
Went from turntables to MP3's
From ""Beat Street""to commercials on Mickey D's
From gold cables to Jacobs
From plain facials to Botox and face lifts
I'm looking over my shoulder
It's about 80 people from my hood that showed up
And they came to show love
Sold out concert and the doors are closed shut",Nas,2006,"[56, 76]",2

You sit there in your heartache
Waiting on some beautiful boy to
To save you from your old ways
You play forgiveness
Watch it now, here he comes
He doesn't look a thing like Jesus
But he talks like a gentlemen
Like you imagined
When you were young

[Verse 1]
Can we climb this mountain? I don't know
Higher now than ever before
I know we can make it if we take it slow
Let's take it easy
Easy now, watch it go
We're burning down the highway skyline
On the back of a hurricane that started turning
When you were young
When you were young

[Interlude]
And sometimes you close your eyes
And see the place where you used to live
When you were young

They say the devil's water — it ain't so sweet
You don't have to drink right now
But you can dip your feet
Every once in a little while

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
I heard motherfuckers sayin' they made Hov
Made Hov say, ""Okay, so, make another Hov!""
Niggas wasn't playin' they day role
So we parted ways like Ben and J-Lo
I shoulda been did it but I been in a daze though
I put friends over business end of the day though
But when friends' business interests is Day Glow
Ain't nothin' left to say though
I guess we forgot what we came fo'
Shoulda stayed in food and beverage
Too much flossin', too much Sam Rothstein
I ain't a bitch but I gotta divorce them
Hov had to get the shallow shit up off him
And I ain't even want to be famous
Niggas is brainless to unnecessarily go through these changes
And I ain't even know how it came to this
Except that fame is the worst drug known to man
It's stronger than, heroin
When you could look in the mirror like, ""There I am""
And still not see what you've become
I know I'm guilty of it too, but not like them; you lost one

I don't think it's meant to be, B
For she loves her work more than she does me
And honestly, at twenty-three
I would probably love my work more than I did she
So, we ain't we, it's me and her
'Cause what she prefers over me is work
And that's where we differ
So I have to give her free time, even if it hurts
So, breathe, mami, it's deserved
You've been put on this Earth
To be all you can be like the Reserves
And me? My time in the army, it's served
So I have to allow she her time to serve
The time's now for her, in time she'll mature
And maybe we can be we again like we were
Finally, my time's too short to share
And to ask her now it ain't fair, so yeah, she lost one

[Chorus: Chrisette Michele  & Jay-Z]
Lose, one, let go to get one
Get, one, lose some to win some (oh yeah, she lost one)
Story of a champion
Sorry I'm a champion
You lost one

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
My nephew died in the car I bought
So I'm under the belief it's partly my fault
Close my eyes and squeeze, try to block that thought
Place any burden on me but please, not that, Lord
But time don't go back, it goes forward
Can't run from the pain, go towards it
Some things can't be explained, what caused it?
Such a beautiful soul, so pure, shit!
Gonna see you again, I'm sure of it
'Til that time, little man, I'm nauseous
Your girlfriend's pregnant, the Lord's gift
Almost lost my faith, that restored it
It's like havin' your life restarted
Can't wait for your child's life to be a part of it
So now I'm child-like, waitin' for a gift
To return, when I lost you, I lost it

The lean and hungry type
Nothing is new
I've seen her here before
Watching and waiting
Ooh, she's sitting with you, but her eyes are on the door

Like whales beneath me diving down
I'm sinking to the bottom of my
Everything that freaks me out
The lighthouse beam has just run out

For a spotlight, give me something
I need something for protection

(How can I keep up this breathing?)
Not knowing how to think
I scream aloud, begin to sink
My legs and arms are broken down
With envy for the solid ground
I'm reaching for the life within me

Here’s to the strong, thanks to the brave don’t give up hope some people change
Against all odds, against the grain love finds a way, some people change

67,You Save Me,"[Verse 1]
Every now and then I get a little lost
My strings all get tangled, my wires all get crossed
Every now and then I'm right up on the edge
Dangling my toes out over the ledge
I just thank God you're here

[Chorus]
Cause when I'm a bullet shot out of a gun
Cause when I'm a firecracker coming undone
Or when I'm a fugitive ready to run, all wild-eyed and crazy
No matter where my reckless soul takes me
Baby you save me

[Verse 2]
It's hard loving' a man that's got a gypsy soul
I don't know how you do it, I'm not sure how you know
The perfect thing to say to save me from myself
You're the angel that believes in me like nobody else
And I thank God you do

[Chorus]
Cause when I'm a bullet shot out of a gun
When I'm a firecracker coming undone
When I'm a fugitive ready to run, all wild-eyed and crazy
No matter where my reckless soul takes me
Baby you save me

[Verse 3]
I know I don't tell you nearly enough
That I couldn't live one day without your love
When I'm a ship tossed around on the waves
Up on a high wire that's ready to break
When I've had just about all I can take
Baby you, baby you save me

[Chorus]
When I'm a bullet shot out of a gun
When I'm a firecracker coming undone
When I'm a fugitive ready to run, all wild-eyed and crazy
No matter where my reckless soul takes me

Oh yeah and I think I'll go to Boston
I think that I'm just tired
I think I need a new town, to leave this all behind

70,River,"[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said ""Bye Suzanne""
After the first night, but tonight I am

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was ""come sunlight, scram,"" now we hug tight, and...
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
My name's (ooh), my name's (ooh)
River (ooh), river run
Call me (ooh), call me (ooh)
River (ooh), we'll let the river run

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Always the bridesmaid, never ""The bride, hey!""
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one (I'm sorry)
I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain

Ora puoi pure piangere se non ci sentiamo
Ora non mi dispiace se non mi cercherai, ehi

Sperando in un messaggio che non arriva mai
Sono una rockstar, rockstar
A uccidermi, no, non sarà una stronza, ehi

E se provi a scaldarlo rischi che si sciolga
Pusher sul mio iPhone, pute sul mio iPad
Mamma guarda, senza mani, sono una rockstar
Mamma sai che a parte te non amo nessun'altra
Non esco più di tre volte con una ragazza
Non innamorarti mai di me
Non potrò mai essere il tuo boyfriend, no

Amava i Beatles e i Rolling Stones
Metteva kush nelle Rolling Papers
E lo sciroppo nel biberon

La mia ex ragazza vuol farmi il voodoo
La mia nuova tipa sembra Sailor Moon
Sogno il posteriore su una BMW

Che-che tu-tu non sarai mai come me, eh
Con questi rapper io ci faccio un frappè, eh eh
Non ho ancora sentito dire: ""Grazie""

Now I be's the block (Partner, let me upgrade you)

I hear you be the block, but I'm the lights that keep the streets on
Notice you the type that like to keep them on a leash though
I'm known to walk alone, but I'm alone for a reason
Sending me a drink ain't appeasing, believe me
Come harder, this won't be easy
Don't doubt yourself, trust me, you need me
This ain't a shoulder with a chip or a ego
But what you think they all mad at me for?

You need a real woman in your life (That's a good look)
Taking care of home and still fly (That's a good look)

When you're in them big meetings for the mills (That's a good look)

I can do for you, what Martin did for the people
Ran by the men, but the women keep the tempo
It's very seldom that you're blessed to find your equals
Still play my part and let you take the lead role, believe me

I'll be the help, whenever you need me (You need me)
I see your hustle with my hustle, I can keep you
Focused on your focus, I can feed you

And rooms at the Bloomberg, and rumors

You can't fit ya hand in ya new purse

Big ends, condos, collecting cars
Picture your life elevating with me

And you already is a star, but unless you're flawless
Then ya dynasty ain't complete without a chief, like me

79,Pain,"[Chorus: Dan Reynolds & Sam Harris]
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames

I'm a slave to your games (I'm just a sucker for pain)
I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down
Oooohh, I'm just a sucker for pain

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Dolla $ign! I'm a sucker for pain
I got the squad tatted on me from my neck to my ankles
Pressure from the man got us all in rebellion
We gon' go to war, yeah, without failure
Do it for the fam dog, ten toes down dog
Love and the loyalty that's what we stand for
Alienated by society
All this pressure give me anxiety
Walk slow through the fire
Like, who gon' try us?
Feeling the world go against us
So we put the world on our shoulders

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds & Sam Harris]
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you

I been rollin' with my team, we the illest on the scene

I been riding 'round the city with my, squad
We just posted, getting crazy, living like this is so amazing
Hold up, take a step back when we roll up cause I know what
We been loyal, we been fam, we the ones you trust in
Won't hesitate to go straight to your head like a concussion
I know I been bussin', no discussion for my family
No hesitation, through my scope I see my enemy
Like what's up? Hold up, we finna re-load up
Yes I re-load up, I know what up, I know what up

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds & Sam Harris]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uhh, devoted to destruction
A full dosage of detrimental dysfunction
I'm dying slow but the devil tryna rush me
See, I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy
Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat
Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat
Eating peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast
And if I get stung, I get stoked, might choke
Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal, naked in the North Pole
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
So I don't fear shit but tomorrow
And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nuttin' but pain
You just fuckin' complain, you ain't tough as you claim
Just stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne
I'ma jump from my plane or stand in front of a train
'Cause I'm a sucker for pain

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
Used to doing bad now we feel like we just now getting it
Ain't got no other way so we start it and finish it
No pain, no gain
Never stand down, made our own way
Never going slow, we pick up the pace
This is what we wanted from a young age
No emotion, that's what business is
Lord have mercy on the witnesses

I torture you
Take my hand through the flames

I'm just a sucker for pain

80,The Carpal Tunnel Of Love,"[Verse 1]
We take sour sips from life's lush lips
And we shake, shake, shake the hips in relationships
Stomp out this disaster town,  you'll put your eyes to the sun and say, ""I know
You're only blinding to keep back what the clouds are hiding""

[Pre-Chorus]
And we might have started singing just a little soon
We're throwing stones at a glass moon

[Chorus]
Whoa oh, we're so miserable and stunning
Whoa oh, love songs for the genuinely cunning, whoa-oh

[Verse 2]
We keep the beat with your blistered feet
We bullet the words at the mockingbirds singing
Slept through the weekend and dreaming of sinking with the melody of the cliffs of eternity
Got postcards from my former selves saying, ""How you been?""

[Pre-Chorus]
We might have said goodbyes just a little soon
(Stomp out this disaster town)
Robbing lips, kissing banks under this moon

[Chorus]
Whoa oh, we're so miserable and stunning
Whoa oh, love songs for the genuinely cunning
Whoa oh, we're so miserable and stunning
Whoa oh, love songs for the genuinely cunning, whoa-oh

[Bridge]
It was ice cream headaches and sweet avalanche
When the pearls in our shells got up to dance
You call me a bad tipper of the cradle
Tired yawns for fawns on hunter's lawns
We're the has-beens of husbands
Sharpening the knives of young wives
Take two years and call me when you're better
Take teardrops of mine, find yourself wetter

[Chorus]
Whoa oh, we're so miserable and stunning
Whoa oh, love songs for the genuinely cunning
Whoa oh, we're so miserable and stunning
Whoa oh, love songs for the genuinely cunning, whoa-oh",Fall Out Boy,2006,[81],1
81,Stupid Boy,"[Verse 1]
Well, she was precious like a flower
She grew wild, wild, but innocent
A perfect prayer in a desperate hour
She was everything beautiful and different

[Pre-Chorus]
Stupid boy, you can't fence that in
Stupid boy, it's like holding back the wind

[Chorus]
She laid her heart and soul right in your hands
And you stole her every dream and you crushed her plans
She never even knew she had a choice
And that's what happens when the only voice she hears is telling her she can't
Stupid boy
Stupid boy, oh

[Verse 2]
So what made you think you could take a life
And just push it, push it around
I guess to build yourself up so high
You had to take her and break her down

[Chorus]
Stupid boy, you can't fence that in
Stupid boy, it's like holding back the wind
She laid her heart and soul right in your hands
And you stole her every dream and you crushed her plans
She never even knew she had a choice
And that's what happens when the only voice she hears is telling her she can't
You stupid boy

[Bridge 1]
Oh, you always had to be right
But now you've lost the only thing that ever made you feel alive
Ooh, yeah

[Chorus]
Well, she laid her heart and soul right in your hands
And you stole her every dream and you crushed her plans
Yes, you did
She never even knew she had a choice
And that's what happens when the only voice she hears is telling her she can't
You stupid boy, oh
I'm the same old, same old stupid boy

[Bridge 2]
It took a while for her to figure out she could run
But when she did, she was long gone, long gone

[Outro]
Ah, she's gone, she's long gone
Yes, she's gone
Yeah, oh
Nobody's ever going to love me like she loved me
And she loved me, she loved me
God, please, just let her know
I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Baby
Yeah, I'm down on my knees
She's never coming back to me",Keith Urban,2006,"[82, 95]",2

[Intro]
Crème de la crème, homie, top shelf you know
I like my beat down low, down low, down low, down low
Down low, down low, down low, I like my top let back
Let back, let back, let back let back, let back

[Hook]
I like my beat down low and my top let back
Can see me ridin 24's with a chopper in the back
You like your Kenwood hot and your top let back
If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black
I like my beat down low and my top let back
Can see me ridin 24's with a chopper in the back
You like your Kenwood hot and your top let back
If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black

[Verse 1]
I'm the man in my city ain't nobody fucking wit me
You can ask the real niggas and all the bad bitches
I'm a known drug dealer I always have 50's
And the thugs and the killers was all in class wit me
SS'S on 26's watching some television
Shorty I'm never slipping got the Beretta in vision
And ready to pop the clip in, ready to get to tripping
Ready to show these folks a celebrity pistol whipping
Pimp stole the automobile and the roof for the tag missing
Polices' try to pursue me it's nothing but gas given
Addicted to fast living, guess I'm one of my dad's children
Think I'm bad now, you should've seen me before I had children
Give dick to your daddy's daughter and dare her to have children
Hope he got some insurance cause death her ass is enduring
Kill her in Mississippi and drive her ass to Missouri
Still my wet paint drippin' while I'm woodgrain gripping

[Hook]
I like my beat down low and my top let back

Young niggas filthy rich and we ain't worried about much
On this Glock I clutch, In God I trust
If a fuck nigga start, bet his heart I bust
Got your partners and the broad in your car fucked up
What, you're under estimation thought a star wouldn't bust
I got the heart and the guts on this purp I blow
Move 10 bricks daily trying to twerk 5 mo'
Ya see the Cadillac swerving down Hollywood Road
On the fliest Spur in Cali fucking Hollywood Ho's
On a pill and half with my partner Young Dro
Bumping Goodie Mob Soul Food number fo'
Other rappers' old news, told dudes I'ma pro
With a loaded fo' fo' and a quarter brick of blow

I wear the crown down under man somebody better tell 'em
'Fore I spit a hundred rounds and have everybody bailing
I got some bitches in a Benz and my partners in the Chevy
And now we riding Giovanni's and Asani's on Pirellis
If you ever think of trying to run up on me just forget it
The clip in the chopper long as ya leg and leave ya shredded
Pistol way in the truck got my knife on tuck
You think he ain't getting stuck, you got life fucked up
A couple stitches in ya hip will have your night fucked up
Will he live? Will he die? Guess he might luck up
Meanwhile, I'm racing my Ferrari like a light for a buck
Against Lamborghini Gallardos every time I get a car

Show 'em white gold, sorta hold it like my timbs
And the chain hang 24 inches like the rims
Diamonds all blown up (yea) sorta like a pimp
So when the light hit the ice it starts glistenin' off the tip
My chain hang, all it do is bling-bling

So check out my swag
Diamonds red, white, and blue like the American flag (its so colorful)
And see I got that nice cream
So much money I spent on jewels, I call it my ice cream
Give you a black eye cause of the beating

86,I Loved Her First,"Look at the two of you dancing that way
Lost in the moment and each other's face
So much in love your alone in this place
Like there's nobody else in the world
I was enough for her not long ago
I was her number one, she told me so
And she still means the world to me
Just so you know
So be careful when you hold my girl
Time changes everything
Life must go on
And I'm not going to stand in your way

But I loved her first, I held her first
And a place in my heart will always be hers
From the first breath she breathed
When she first smiled at me
I knew the love of a father runs deep
And I prayed that she'd find you someday
But it still hard to give her away
I loved her first

How could that beautiful woman with you
Be the same freckle face kid that I knew
The one that I read all those fairy tales to
And tucked into bed all those nights
And I knew the first time I saw you with her
It was only a matter of time

But I loved her first and I held her first
And a place in my heart will always be hers
From the first breath she breathed
When she first smiled at me
I knew the love of a father runs deep
And I prayed that she'd find you someday
But its still hard to give her away
I loved her first

From the first breath she breathed
When she first smiled at me
I knew the love of a father runs deep
Someday you might know what I'm going through
When a miracle smiles up at you
I loved her first",Heartland,2006,"[87, 80, 68, 57, 56, 51, 49, 45, 36, 34, 36, 37, 39, 43, 45, 45, 55, 62, 75]",19
87,Love Like Winter,"[Verse 1]
Warn your warmth to turn away
Here, it's December every day (I like that)
Press your lips to the sculptures
And surely, you'll stay (love like winter)
For of sugar and ice
I am made, I am made

[Chorus]
(It's in the blood
It's in the blood)
I met my love before I was born
(He wanted love
I taste of blood)
He bit my lip, and drank my war
From years before, from years before

[Verse 2]
She exhales vanilla lace
I barely dreamt her, yesterday (yesterday)
Read the lines in the mirror through the lipstick trace
(Por siempre)
She said, ""It seems you're somewhere far away,"" to his face

[Chorus]
(It's in the blood
It's in the blood)
I met my love before I was born
(She wanted love
I taste of blood)
She bit my lip, and drank my war
From years before, from years before

[Bridge]
Love like winter, oh-oh, oh-oh
Love like winter, winter
Three, four

[Chorus]
(It's in the blood

88,Let's Ride,"[Verse 1]
Pull the rag off the six-fo'
Hit the switch, show niggas how the shit go
The Game is back, the Aftermath chain is gone
The Ds is chrome, the frame is black (So watch it lift up)
'Til the motherfucker bounce and break
And knock both of the screws out the licence plate
Let the games begin
These other rap niggas so far behind me could taste my rims
Shit, let the chronic burn as the Daytons spin
It ain’t been this much drama since I first heard Eminem
In the club, poppin' X pills like M&Ms
Call it Dre day, we celebratin', bitch bring a friend
Bottles on me, tell the waiter to order another round
And put that cheap-ass Hypnotic down (Put your ‘cris up!)
If you feel the same way
Who got 'em hittin' switches NY to LA

[Chorus]
(If I could fit the whole hood in the club)
Hop in the low-rider, long as you got bitches in the back
(I turn it into a strip-club)
Call it a lap-dance, when the six-fo' bounce that ass
(If I could fit the hole world in the club)
Tell the DJ to bang my shit, the west-coast in this bitch
(Pop bottles and twist up)
Roll up chronic and hash
In a blunt, call it Aftermath

[Verse 2]
Somebody tell me where the drinks at, where the bitches at
You fuckin' on the first night, meet me in the back
I got a pound of chronic, and a gang of freaks
Move bitch! Who the fuck you think they came to see?
The protégé of the D-R-E
Take a picture with him, then you gotta fuck me
And you gotta fuck Busta, can’t touch Eve
Got somethin' in my waist that you can’t touch either
That’s, my gangsta bitch, and like Crips and Bloods
I’m in the club on some gangsta shit (So nigga twist up)
Light another dub
Bitches get scared when niggas start fightin' in the club
Ain’t nothin' but a g-thing, baby it’s a g-thing
Bounce like you got hydraulics in your g-string
I fuck a different bitch seven days a week
Hit the switch, watch it bounce like a Scott Storch beat

[Chorus]
(If I could fit the whole hood in the club)
Hop in the low-rider, long as you got bitches in the back
(I turn it into a strip-club)
Call it a lap-dance, when the six-fo' bounce that ass
(If I could fit the hole world in the club)
Tell the DJ to bang my shit, the west-coast in this bitch
(Pop bottles and twist up)
Roll up chronic and hash
In a blunt, call it Aftermath

[Verse 3]
Niggas thought I wasn’t coming back, look at me now
Hoppin' out the same Cherry six-fo'
With the motherfucking top down, I'm The Game, nigga
Call your bitch, she ain't home, she with Game, nigga
Remember that, Dre you passed me the torch
I lit the chronic with it, now the world is my ashtray
Ridin' three-wheel motion ‘till the ass scrapes
Turn sunset into a motherfucking drag-race
Now watch it bounce
Hit the switch, let it bounce till the police shut the shit down
(When you hit the club)
Tell 'em you came with me (We gonna twist up)
In the V.I.P
It’s a new day, and if you ever knew Dre
Motherfucker, you would say I was the new Dre
Same Impala, different spokes
Same chronic, just a different smoke

[Chorus]
(If I could fit the whole hood in the club)
Hop in the low-rider, long as you got bitches in the back
(I turn it into a strip-club)
Call it a lap-dance, when the six-fo' bounce that ass

Tell the DJ to bang my shit, the west-coast in this bitch

89,Ladies Love Country Boys,"[Intro]
This is for all you sophisticated ladies out there

[Verse 1]
She grew up in the city in a little subdivision
Her daddy wore a tie, mama never fried a chicken
Ballet, straight-As, most likely to succeed
They bought her a car after graduation
Sent her down South for some higher education
Put her on the fast track to a Law Degree
Now she's coming home to visit
Holding the hand of a wild-eyed boy
With a farmers tan

[Chorus]
Shes riding in the middle of his pickup truck
Blaring Charlie Daniels, yelling, Turn it up!
They raised her up a lady, but there's one thing
They couldn't avoid
Ladies love country boys

[Verse 2]
You know mamas and daddies want better for their daughters
Hope they'll settle down with a doctor or a lawyer
And their uptown, ball gown, hand-me-down royalty
They never understand why their princess falls
For some camouflage britches and a southern-boy-drawl

[Chorus]
She's riding in the middle of his pickup truck
Blaring Hank Jr., yelling, turn it up
They raised her up a lady, but there's one thing
They couldn't avoid, ladies love country boys

[Bridge]
You can train them, you can try to teach them
Right from wrong but its still going to turn them on

[Chorus]
She's riding in the middle of his pickup truck
Blaring Lynyrd Skynyrd, yelling, turn it up
They raised her up a lady, but there's one thing
They couldn't avoid, ladies love country boys

You wanna make fires and get Norwegian wood with me

It makes a man feel good, baby

91,Nothing Left To Lose,"[Verse]
Happy birthday kid, now go ahead and make a wish
For everything that's old and gray to turn back to new again
Happy birthday friend, let's raise a glass for what's ahead
For all the nights that never end, ""let's raise a couple more"", I said
Happy birthday me, I'm spilling over everything
We drank away the drinks for free, they always seem to follow me
Happy birthday you, the trouble we could get into
When I got nothing else to do, and you got nothing left to lose

[Chorus]
Let's go and bury our conditions
With sex and alcohol and songs with our friends
You call it crazy, it's all that we've ever been
We're making everything old feel new again

[Verse]
Happy birthday kid, tonight we're taking off the edge
Slow down and tell me what you did, so tell me everything
Happy birthday, well I think we got enough for bail
I think we do but I can't tell, we'll probably spend the night in jail
Happy birthday me, I drank away the memories
Do you remember 21? I don't remember 17
Happy birthday you, the trouble we could get into
When you got nothing else to do, and I got nothing left to lose

[Chorus]
Let's go and bury our conditions
With sex and alcohol and songs with our friends
You call it crazy, it's all that we've ever been
We're making everything old feel new again

But first of all, let me say
I must apologize for acting stank and treating you this way
'Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor
It's your fault, you didn't shut the refrigerator
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold

If I could escape (Escape) and recreate a place that's my own world (Own world)
And I could be your favorite girl (Forever), perfectly together
And tell me boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? (Sweet escape)

You melt me down, I'm at my lowest boiling point
Come help me out, I need to get me out of this joint
Come on, let's bounce, counting on you to turn me around
Instead of clowning around, let's look for some common ground
So baby, times get a little crazy
I've been gettin' a little lazy
Waitin' on you to come save me
I can see that you're angry by the way that you treat me
Hopefully you don't leave me, wanna take you with me

If I could escape (Escape) and recreate a place that's my own world (Own world)
And I could be your favorite girl (Forever), perfectly together

But you say that you'll call and you don't

So I'm goin' out tonight in my red high heels

94,I'll Be Home For Christmas (Live),"Rudy lives on the borderline
Between civilization and basic survival
And the summertime treats him fairly well
But the wintertime is a dirty cold rival

It's wintertime now in Georgetown
The streets come alive with the Christmas light
And Rudy sleeps on a warm air grate
With a newspaper blanket on December nights

Deck the halls
Rudolph the red-nosed wino
Knows it's Christmas time
Jingle Bells and Christmas shoppers

Dashing through the snow
God rest ye merry gentlemen
Who've found it in your hearts
To flip Rudy a thin

And I'll be home for Christmas
But this man has
No place to go
Christmas has a meaning at all

The people of greed and incredible waste
They seek the deeper meaning
In the shopping mall
In a yuletide spirit

Of impatience and hate
Rudy is a patient man
Who tries to see the beauty in everything
Yes, and not a very demanding soul

Whose only wish is
To live until the Spring
Nobody knows the reasons why
Things turn out

Like the way they do
And there ain't no one to tell you
The reasons why
There's fortunate folks

Like me and you
Rudy must have people somewhere
Who wonder what
Became of the man

And Rudy must wonder
The same damn thing
As the crowd passes by
And he sticks out his hand

Deck the halls
Rudolph the red-nosed wino
Knows it's Christmas time
Jingle Bells in the Christmas Shop

Others dashing through the snow
God rest ye merry gentlemen
Who have found it in your hearts
To flip Rudy a thin

And I'll be home for Christmas
But this man has
No place to go
Rudy died on the borderline

Of a civilized world
On Christmas Eve
You know the shoppers shopped
And the temperatures dropped

On a man whose absence
Won't be grieved
Peace on the soul of the cop
Who found him dead in a booth

With his hand frozen to a telephone
You know, I think I know
Who he had on the line
And Rudy won't spend

This Christmas alone
Deck the halls
Rudolph the red-nosed wino
Knows it's Christmas time

Jingle Bells in the Christmas Shop
Others dashing through the snow
God rest ye merry gentlemen
Who have found it in your hearts

To flip Rudy a thin
And I'll be home for Christmas
And this year
Rudy gets to go

Yeah, I'll be home for Christmas
And this year, Rudy gets to go",The Be Good Tanyas,2006,[95],1

98,One Wing In The Fire,"[Verse 1]
Daddy's been a back-row Baptist
With his share of front-row sin
His Saturday night still on his breath
Every Sunday when he'd walk in
He's never led the Benediction
He's never sang in the choir
But he's an angel with no halo
And one wing in the fire

[Verse 2]
Mama lives by the Bible
The Bible lives by the bed
And she's lied alone so many nights
With scriptures in her head
Praying Good Lord, just be with him
I know his faith is tired
But he's an angel with no halo
And one wing in the fire

[Chorus]
And I know he lives a little left of living right
And he's come close to going way too far a few times
But I'd trade a thousand prayers
If just one prayer would come true
Lord, please believe in him like I believe in you

[Verse 2]
Daddy's always been there for me
From T-Ball to touchdowns
Fixed my car an' fixed my heart
When they've been broken down
I know he calls for more forgiveness
Than most folks do require
But he's an angel with no halo
An' one wing in the fire

[Chorus]
And I know he lives a little left of living right
And he's come close to going way too far a few times
But I'd trade a thousand prayers
If just one prayer would come true
Lord, please believe in him like I believe in you

Well, I just can't imagine
What Heaven might be like

And one wing in the fire",Trent Tomlinson,2006,"[99, 96]",2

Game don't wait (heavy. wait.)
Eyes heavy but it's time to grind motherfucker
Can't be late (hold up. wait.)
Fuck a nine-to-five, push work state-to-state (shit)
No work, no food, still eatin' off paper plates
Banana clip is a paperweight, paper mate
Tell 'em how you're married to the game
She fuckin' everybody but you still put a ring on it, on it
Keep it one hunnit, homies, home is where the homies
Home is where the homies got your back
Get your backpack get
Back to the block, bring it back to the block, shit
Slangin' crack beats cracks into Sacroiliac
But the Glock cocked back, lay another body flat

[Hook: Mariel Jacoda]
Here when they turn on the street lights
Hustle 'til they cut 'em off, that's the street life
Got the chrome on my hip and a bird for sale
That's how I get mine, that's how I get it

[Verse 2: Daveed Diggs]
Hustlin' is a habit, so they say
This is for the G's who wasn't trippin' and never knew any other way
Other ways of gettin' money, not many do not require
A degree of separation from the streets you gettin' paid in
In which the degree of difficulty is extraordinarily high
And she high while doin' it so see why
Somebody who isn't from it might not understand
How you body a body in other words (how I could just kill a man)
And still a gram is a gram and nobody is Instagramin'
They killin' on Cypress Hill and they still is squeezin' the hammers
Police is beyond the scanners, these some obsequious bandits
And brandishin' flags of function
You fuck a figure, it's fashion then flash on a motherfucker
You fuckin' seeing the passion, forgetting the hunger
This the jungle, time to get active and crack it
So acrobatic, it'll flip in a sec, but set's up and no second guessing
Here in the street, people sweating for the money

[Hook: Mariel Jacoda]

Hustle 'til they cut 'em off, that's the street life

[Verse 3: Daveed Diggs]
No time for wifey's babies or other collateral damage
Checking for snitches, they be the ones order tacos in Spanish
Always thinking that they blendin' in, but then sending them telegrams
To the rollers, they bitches, not meaning feminine
Meaning, fuck it, ain't no explaining, get the fuck up and push cocaine
All these fuckers gon' sleep all day
But if you suck up when one of you step up to these bucks
Knock if you lacing up them chucks, no Taylor Gangin'
This shit is grimy and dirty, clothes stankin' while you slangin'
Get up out to the blacktop, backpack for the crack rock
Take shot at the cops at a spot where they knock a neighborhood watch
Watch him, learn the code if them eyes are closed
That means he sleeping on his feet and been out in the cold
And if he flashin' the gold
He either new or want action and got back up on the toes
Study all of your fractions, get up on the honor roll
Roll the marijuana then flip the hoodie up and get ghost

[Hook: Mariel Jacoda]
Here when they turn on the street lights
Hustle 'til they cut 'em off, that's the street life

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Who would have ever thought that we would fall like London bridges
I know you heard the rumors about me lies and superstitions
Heard but ain't choose to listen that’s what made you different
And you keep me driven guess that’s why I could see us going the distance
On nights you text and text and text with no auto corrections
Misspelling every other word but I still got the message
And you get carried away like you wearing wedding dresses
I'm sorry I even ever gave you reasons to question
Cause you make me feel like the chosen one
Eight billion people in the world and I still chose the one
Answer this question and I'll answer what you asking me
What happened if we got in an accident died tragically
And next lifetime you remembered and had to come after me
And convinced me that we not meant to be that have to be
And like the defending champs you had to win it all back for me
Just got to know how deep is our love actually
What if this was the end and we had to bow out together
I need you to tell me every emotion like now or never
Only two times I ever needed you was now and forever
Don't know what else to tell you

But not out of 10

Wondering when they'll break through these chains
But little boys have action toys for brains
I'm living proof it can last a long time
Now the girls off the street are innocent and sweet
When they're all in bed
They got their make-up and dreams of wonderland
Sprinkled inside their heads
And soon they will change
But tonight Hollywood has never seemed so strange
Now mother's pray it'll last a long time

I want to roll around like a kid in the snow
I want to re-learn what I already know
Just let me take flight
Dressed in red, through the night

Now they boys are all grown up
And their working their fingers to the bone
They go around chasing them girls on the weekend
You know they still can't be alone
I've been racking my brain
With thoughts of peace and love
How on earth did we get so mixed up?
I pray to god it don't last a long time

I want to roll around like a kid in the snow
I want to re-learn what I already know

There's something on the roof
I wonder what this night will bring

103,Mountains,"Far over the Misty Mountains cold
To dungeons deep and caverns old
We must away, ere break of day
To seek our pale enchanted gold

The dwarves of yore made mighty spells
While hammers fell like ringing bells
In places deep, where dark things sleep
In hollow halls beneath the fells

For ancient king and elvish lord
There many a gleaming golden hoard
They shaped and wrought, and light they caught
To hide in gems on hilt of sword

On silver necklaces they strung
The flowering stars, on crowns they hung
The dragon-fire, on twisted wire
They meshed the light of moon and sun

Far over the Misty Mountains cold
To dungeons deep and caverns old
We must away, ere break of day
To claim our long-forgotten gold

Goblets they carved there for themselves
And harps of gold, where no man delves
There lay they long, and many a song
Was sung unheard by men or elves

The pines were roaring on the heights
The wind was moaning in the night
The fire was red, it flaming spread
The trees like torches blazed with light

The bells were ringing in the dale
And men looked up with faces pale
The dragon's ire, more fierce than fire
Laid low their towers and houses frail

The mountain smoked beneath the moon
The dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom
They fled the hall to dying fall
Beneath his feet, beneath the moon

Far over the Misty Mountains grim
To dungeons deep and caverns dim
We must away, ere break of day
To win our harps and gold from him!

The wind was on the withered heath
But in the forest stirred no leaf
There shadows lay be night or day
And dark things silent crept beneath

The wind came down from mountains cold
And like a tide it roared and rolled
The branches groaned, the forest moaned
And leaves were laid upon the mould

The wind went on from West to East;
All movement in the forest ceased
But shrill and harsh across the marsh
Its whistling voices were released

The grasses hissed, their tassels bent
The reeds were rattling--on it went
O'er shaken pool under heavens cool
Where racing clouds were torn and rent

It passed the Lonely Mountain bare
And swept above the dragon's lair
There black and dark lay boulders stark
And flying smoke was in the air

It left the world and took its flight
Over the wide seas of the night
The moon set sail upon the gale
And stars were fanned to leaping light

Under the Mountain dark and tall
The King has come unto his hall!
His foe is dead, the Worm of Dread
And ever so his foes shall fall!

The sword is sharp, the spear is long
The arrow swift, the Gate is strong
The heart is bold that looks on gold
The dwarves no more shall suffer wrong

The dwarves of yore made mighty spells
While hammers fell like ringing bells
In places deep, where dark things sleep
In hollow halls beneath the fells

On silver necklaces they strung
The light of stars, on crowns they hung
The dragon-fire, from twisted wire
The melody of harps they wrung

The mountain throne once more is freed!
O! Wandering folk, the summons heed!
Come haste! Come haste! Across the waste!
The king of friend and kin has need

Now call we over the mountains cold
'Come back unto the caverns old!
Here at the gates the king awaits
His hands are rich with gems and gold

The king has come unto his hall
Under the Mountain dark and tall
The Wyrm of Dread is slain and dead
And ever so our foes shall fall

Farewell we call to hearth and hall!
Though wind may blow and rain may fall
We must away, ere break of day
Far over the wood and mountain tall

To Rivendell, where Elves yet dwell
In glades beneath the misty fell
Through moor and waste we ride in haste
And whither then we cannot tell

With foes ahead, behind us dread
Beneath the sky shall be our bed
Until at last our toil be passed
Our journey done, our errand sped

We must away! We must away!
We ride before the break of day!",J. R. R. Tolkien,2006,"[84, 77, 82, 82, 87, 85, 93, 89, 99, 96, 92]",11

Como aguacero de mayo

Y cae tan fuerte que hasta
Me quema hasta la piel

Y ya no sé lo qué pensar
Si tu recuerdo me hace bien
O me hace mal

(Tu recuerdo sigue aquí)
Le lo lai le lo le lo

Pero que rompe, rompe el corazón

Waiting for so long

Die for anyone

God broke the mold when he made this one, I know
She's breathtaking, but so much more
She walks in the room, your lungs close
Making you never wanna breathe again
Her boyfriend has got so much dough
So much ice, his neck, and wrist froze
Is he faithful to her? Hell no
But she chose to be with him, shorty

Tell me, is the money worth your soul?
Tell me what's the reason that you hold on
When you know that dude has a whole wall of 'em just like you?

Girl, use your mind
Don't be just another dime
Because...

[Verso 1: Anahí]
Ser o parecer quien te imaginas
No me puede hacer la dueña de tu vida
Si no me miras, baby

[Verso 2: Dulce María]
Mucho yo intenté por levantar la voz
Por despertar el interés vacío
Que te haga mío, baby

[Pre-coro: Anahí]
Y sé que tal vez ese día
Nunca me suceda

[Coro: RBD]
Pero tú en mis sueños siempre has de estar
Como una luz que me ilumina
Y al despertar quiero volverlo a intentar
Yo, sé que el corazón late más fuerte, más que un motor
Y aunque no sabes nada de mí
Un día te habré de alcanzar, amor

[Verso 3: Maite]
Cuando lo logré y me acerqué a ti
Me congelé, los nervios me mataban
No dije nada, baby

[Verso 4: Anahí y Dulce María, Anahí]
Otro día que me convencí de hablar
Te vi pasar con otra muy contento
No era el momento, baby

[Pre-coro: Dulce María]
Cómo sucedió que estoy loca
Tan enamorada

[Coro: RBD]
Pero tú en mis sueños siempre has de estar
Como una luz que me ilumina
Y al despertar quiero volverlo a intentar
Yo, sé que el corazón late más fuerte, más que un motor
Y aunque no sabes nada de mí
Un día te habré de alcanzar, amor

[Puente: Anahí, Dulce]
Verte pasar sin hablar es un cruel sufrimiento
Que desaparece de pronto cuando te pienso
Volando a mi lado, colgados de un sentimiento
No importan los días que pase o muera en el intento
Volverlo a Intentar

[Coro: RBD]
Pero tú en mis sueños siempre has de estar
Como una luz que me ilumina
Y al despertar quiero volverlo a intentar
Yo, sé que el corazón late más fuerte, más que un motor
Y aunque no sabes nada de mí
Un día te habré de alcanzar, amor

[Coro: Christian, Alfonso y Christopher, Anahí, RBD]
Pero tú en mis sueños siempre has de estar
Como una luz que me ilumina (volverlo a intentar)
Y al despertar quiero volverlo a intentar, yo

Y aunque no sabes nada de mí
Un día te habré de alcanzar, amor

El tiempo que pasó
Se lo llevó la vida
Solo queda tu aroma
Con la cama destendida

Recuerdos se apoderan de mi mente
Un vaso con un tequila caliente
El dolor haciéndonos compañía
Y yo que pensaba que no dolía

¿En Dónde Está Tú Amor?
¿A dónde se marchó?
A dónde se esfumó aquella esperanza de que vuelvas
Y es que solo el sabor de tus besos me llega

Y lo que sucedió
Que a la gente le asombre
Y es que lo que me hiciste en verdad que no tiene nombre
De que sirve tu adiós si ya no volverás

Aquí te esperaré
Si piensas regresar

¿En Dónde Está Tú Amor?
¿A dónde se marchó?
A dónde se esfumó aquella esperanza de que vuelvas

118,I Call It Love,"I look at you
You look at me
(You can't tell me you ain't feeling butterflies)
It's obvious
We have some chemistry
(I think I know it because it feels so right)
Girl I wanted so long to know
Now you're telling me you gotta let it go
(Don't tell me I have to start all over again)
I never thought that this day would come
(This is something that I've wanted in my life)
I realize that you're the one
(And you're telling me its time to say goodbye)
What's inside of my heart it ain't going to change
So it shouldn't be so easy to walk away
(You feel it, I feel it, let's not pretend)

[Chorus]
Baby, I don't know what love Is
Maybe I'm a fool
I just know what I'm Feeling
And it's all because of you
Don't tell me
I don't know
I want the truth
Because they call it
We call it
You call it
I call it love

[Verse 2]
It's so clear for you to see
(Don't let anybody tell you what to do)
Why they can't they just let us be happy
(I don't want to find somebody new)
If you know whats really in your heart
Then don't let them tear us apart
(Because you feel it, I feel it
Let's think this through)

[Chorus]
Baby, I don't know what love Is
Maybe I'm a fool
I just know what I'm Feeling
And it's all because of you (please don't go)

I want the truth
Because they call it
We call it
You call it
I call it love

We have a bond that's unbreakable
And it's not time to let it go (don't let it go)
And now that we know it's real
We are going to let it show
To the whole world
That I'm yours forever
And you're my girl (you're my girl)
You might live with me, oh oh

121,Tell Me Baby,"[Verse 1]
They come from every state to find
Some dreams were meant to be declined
Tell the man what did you have in mind
What have you come to do?
No turning water into wine
No learning while you're in the line
I'll take you to the broken sign
You see these lights are blue
Come and get it
Lost it at the city limit
Say goodbye, cause they
Will find a way to trip it
Everybody's looking for a silly gimmick
Got to get away
Can't take it for another minute
This town is made of many things
Just look at what the current brings
So high it's almost promising
This place was made on you

[Chorus]
Tell me baby
What's your story?
Where you come from
And where you want to go this time, oh
Tell me lover
Are you lonely?
The thing we need is never all that hard to find, oh
Tell me baby
What's your story
Where you come from
And where you want to go this time, oh
You're so lovely
Are you lonely?
Giving up on the innocence you left behind

[Verse 2]
Some claim to have the fortitude
Too shrewd to blow the interlude
Sustaining pain to set the mood
Step out to be renewed
I'll move you like a baritone
Jungle brother's on the microphone
Getting over with the undertone
It's time to turn to stone
Chitty chitty baby
When your nose is in the nitty gritty
Life can be a little sweet
But life can be a little shitty
What a pity
Boston and a Kansas City
Looking for a hundred
But you only ever found a fifty
Three fingers in the honeycomb
You ring just like a xylophone
Devoted to the chromosome
The day that you left home

[Chorus]
Tell me baby
What's your story?
Where you come from
And where you want to go this time, oh
Tell me lover
Are you lonely?
The thing we need is never all that hard to find, oh
Tell me baby
What's your story
Where you come from
And where you want to go this time, oh
You're so lovely
Are you lonely?
Giving up on the innocence you left behind
Tell me baby
What's your story?
Where you come from
And where you want to go this time, oh
Tell me lover
Are you lonely?
The thing we need is never all that hard to find, oh

122,Over My Head (Cable Car),"[Verse 1]
I never knew
I never knew that everything was falling through
That everyone I knew was waiting on a queue
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth
But that's how it's gotta be
It's coming down to nothing more than apathy
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
The smoke and who's still standing when it clears

[Chorus]
And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind

[Verse 2]
Let's rearrange
I wish you were a stranger I could disengage
Just say that we agree and then never change
Soften a bit until we all just get along
But that's disregard
You find another friend and you discard
As you lose the argument in a cable car
Hanging above as the canyon comes between

[Chorus]
And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind
She's on your mind
Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind
She's on, on

[Bridge]
And suddenly, I've become a part of your past
I'm becoming the part that don't last
I'm losing you and it's effortless
Without a sound, we lose sight of the ground
In the throw around
Never thought that you wanted to bring it down
I won't let it go down 'til we torch it ourselves

[Chorus]
And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind

Takes me back to the fire in your eyes
Texas stars in a purple night

Brought me back from the dead
That's why they call him the doctor
The 'Math gon' drop him
And 50 ain't rocking with him no more
It's okay! I get it popping
Whole club rocking, like a six-four Impala
Drink Cris', throw it up, call the shit hydraulics
Then piss in the cup, call the shit Hpnotiq (Brrrrat!)
I bleed Compton, spit crack and shit chronic
And you new niggas ain't shit but new niggas
Bathing Ape-shoe niggas, I'm talking to you, niggas
Bouncing in the '64, throwing up West side, man
Sell another 5 million albums? Yes, I am
Fresh like ""Damn, this nigga did it again
A hundred thousand on his neck, L.A. above the brim""
Inside the Lambo, the shotgun with Snoop
What would the muthafuckin' West Coast be
Without one crip and...?

I made room for Jeezy

All I need is one reason
I'm the king, and Dre said it: the West Coast need me
I don't know why you niggas keep trying me
Everybody know that I'm the heir to the Aftermath dynasty
And I ain't gotta make shit for the club
What DJ gon' turn down the thirty-eight snub?
You thirty-eight and you still rapping? Ughhh

When the chronic smoke clear all you gon' see is...

I ain't got beef with 50, no beef with Jay
What's beef when you getting head in the six-trey?
And the double Game chain, I keep 'em on display
Black T-shirt, so all you see is the A
Turn on the TV, and all you see is the A
You niggas better make up a dance and try to get radio play
Keep on snapping your fingers, I ain't going away
I don't regret what I spit, 'cause I know what I say
And niggas talking about me, they don't know when to stop
I got the Louis Vuitton belt buckle holding the Glock
No beam, no silencer; I know when to pop
Wait 'til Lil Jon come on and let off a shot
I have the number one billboard spot
Niggas stepped on my fingers, and I climb right back to the top

So after this flow you might owe me a favor

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I hear ""hurry up Hov'"" when I'm out in the public
'Cause niggas like: ""but you love it; you be it, you're of it
You breathe it, we need it; bring it back to the hustlas""
Had to dust off the Hammer dance, can't touch this
C'mon playboys, bring the cars back out
'Cause ya boy Hov is back, you know them broads coming out
Got 'em dancing on the banquette, like they from Bankhead
Fuck Cristal, so they ask me what we drinking
I thought dudes remark was rude okay
So I moved on to Dom, Krug Rosé
And it's much bigger issues in the world, I know
But I first had to take care of the world I know
I'm from the bottom, so I still feel 'em from the bottom
Underdog before my cape, still couldn't stop him
Flash Gordon when recording, spark the light in the dark
Peter Park', Spider-Man, all I do is climb the charts

[Chorus]

Not only N.Y.C., I'm hip hop's savior
So after this flow you might owe me a favor
When kingdom come, you ready?
When kingdom come, uh huh
Not only N.Y.C., I'm hip hop's savior
So after this flow you might owe me a favor

[Verse 3]
Just when they thought it was all over
I put the whole world on my back and broad shoulders
The War-Hova, but who you know took over tracks like that
Guess what New York, New York - we back
And I ain't never been afraid of a drought
Since I was six, seventeen been getting money down South
Bout it, bout it, Master P
Ask the nigga Pimp C, ask my homie Bun B
I run the streets the streets don't run we
Y'all run, we chill still waters run deep
I repeat, sing a long with me
I run the streets, the streets don't run we
Ladies saying ""Where you been Superman?""
When niggas spending ten million in media on my hands
The Bruce Wayne of the game have no fear
When you need me just throw your ROC signs in the air, yeah!

Not only N.Y.C., I'm hip hop's savior

132,Crazy,"[Verse 1]
I remember when
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions had an echo, in so much space
And when you're out there without care
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much

[Chorus 1]
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly

[Verse 2]
And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice, that's my only advice
Come on now, who do you
Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?
Ha, ha, ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control?

[Chorus 2]
Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me

[Verse 3]
My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on the limb
And all I remember is thinkin' I wanna be like them
Ever since I was little
Ever since I was little, it looked like fun

It picked her up and she'll never get let down
And now I can't stop thinking about it
All you people at the top don't know nothing about it
We don't give a fuck what the price is
So just leave us to our own devices and we'll leave you alone

I'll be there when your heart stops beating
I'll be there when your last breath's taken away
In the dark when there's no one listening
In the times when we both get carried away

She says it all without a thought in her head
She says it all and she's pressed up against me
A little something just to take off the edge
A little more and I'll fall of the planet entirely

I'll be there when your last breath's taken away

[Verse 1]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

Catch a Dylan song or some eclipse of the moon

You can't live in a castle far away

A song plays on while the moon is high over me
Something comes over me

All this lean dopey dope, got me spazzin' out
In the bando doin' numbers, worth some figures now

[Verse 2: SDotBraddy]
Ayy, ayy, let's go!
Nothing was the same when I was 17
I would take a giant huff, just like aubrey
Inky and Blinky pull up, get ghost
That's red and blue lights in Pacman of Atari
What would you do if you felt that most of these niggas was lying just to be king
Then when it's yo turn to be a young Simba
They wanna play Scar in the ring
Fuck all that Hakuna Matata and peace for the stronger
I'll blueprint the game like I'm Shawn Corey Carter
That means I'm O-U-T but dead fucking presidents represent me
Me and my ninjas are smoking on Donatello
Everything's moving in turtle time
But that's an inception of what you can dream
When you elevated and extending your mind
So if a nigga wanna play games I'll treat this shit like Smash Bros
Hit his ass with the C right arrow
A Samus with a flame throw
In the pot is that sugar and spice with everything nice so I'm taking the Powerpuff
My eyes will be blossom when inside the bubble
You know I'm in love with that buttercup, nigga

[Verse 3: Germ]
All alone in the dark thinkin' bout fetti
Pockets all flat like no bubbles in the Remy
Talkin' semi incase a nigga wanna act out
Blow his back out like Bill Clinton did Lewinsky
Clock tickin', talkin' shit to my old ho
Gettin' deep throat, smokin' dope in my dojo
Everything spinnin' as I take a push up the street
80 ounces deep, drunk swervin' cussin' at police
Ridin' round town in a stolen Lamborghini
My bitch ass is fat and she look like Tahiri
Sippin' on Henny, I'm loose off the Bourbon
I'm swervin' Suburbans I might leave you worthless
I'm Beer Can Dan off a two xans in a wasted daze, wastin days
Broad day with da K

From a rainbow you're talkin' like you're Martin Luther King, l'il bitch,  it's lit

You can lick the tip but no picture
I'll put that pussy on Insta
I'm a hustler, baby, so I'm even accepting them nickles, pennies and all
Won't see me they dropping they drawls
You snitch and get teared up like Jaws
Get down to the river, we droppin' you off
Takin' yo wallet then stop to the mall

Hey!
Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh
Hey!
Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh
Hey!

[Verse 1]
Four years, you think, for sure
That’s all you’ve got to endure
All the total dicks
All the stuck-up chicks
So superficial, so immature
Then when, you graduate
Ya take a look around and you say “Hey, wait!
This is the same as where I just came from
I thought it was over! Aw, that’s just great""

[Chorus 1]
The whole damned world is just as obsessed
With who‘s the best dressed and who’s having sex
Who‘s got the money, who gets the honeys
Who‘s kinda cute and who‘s just a mess
And you still don’t have the right look
And you don’t have the right friends
Nothing changes but the faces, the names and the trends
High school never ends
Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh
Hey!
Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh
Hey!

[Verse 2]
Check out the popular kids
You’ll never guess what Jessica did!
And how did Mary Kate lose all that weight?
And Katie had a baby so I guess Tom’s straight!
And the only thing that matters
Is climbing up that social ladder
Still care about your hair and the car you drive
Doesn’t matter if you’re 16 or 35
Reese Witherspoon, she’s the prom queen
Bill Gates, captain of the chess team
Jack Black, the clown, Brad Pitt, the quarterback
Seen it all before
I want my money back!

[Chorus 2]
The whole damned world is just as obsessed
With who’s the best dressed and who’s having sex
Who’s in the club and who’s on the drugs
Who’s throwing up before they digest
And you still don’t have the right look
And you don’t have the right friends
And you still listen to the same shit you did back then
High school never ends
Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh
(High school never ends)

[Chorus 1]
The whole damned world is just as obsessed
With who‘s the best dressed and who‘s having sex
Who‘s got the money, who gets the honeys
Who‘s kinda cute and who‘s just a mess
And I still don’t have the right look
And I still have the same three friends
And I’m pretty much the same as I was back then

Didn't have to run, I knew it was love from a mile away

'Cause I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
'Cause I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
So what? You're from the other side of the tracks
So what? The world don't think we match
I'll put it down like my love's on wax
Guess what? I'm in love with that girl
And she told me, that she's in love with me

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Now we didn't have to fall, but we fell in love to the bottom, babe
No one's there to catch us, like when you fell from Heaven that day, baby

Since I saw your face, I've been staring just the same

I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me

You'll always be my baby, baby, baby
It's so amazing
How you became my baby, baby, baby
My little daisy
Come here, let me rock you like a baby, baby, baby
Pretty lady
Don't you know, you'll always be my baby, baby, baby
Now don't it seem like these days
That everybody's got something to say
But I don't pay attention to the talk, baby
And I don't really care if they stop and stare
'Cause they see my number one
My number one girl

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I told you I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
I don't care
So what? You're from the other side of the tracks
So what? The world don't think we match
I'll put it down like my love's on wax, guess what
I'm in love with that girl
And she already told me that she's in love with me

143,A La Primera Persona,"[Chorus]
A la primera persona que me ayude a comprender
Pienso entregarle mi tiempo, pienso entregarle mi fe
Yo no pido que las cosas me salgan siempre bien
Pero es que ya estoy harto de perderte sin querer

[Chorus]
A la primera persona que me ayude a salir
De este infierno en el que yo mismo decidí vivir
Le regalo cualquier tarde pa' los dos
Lo que digo es que ahora mismo ya no tengo ni siquiera dónde estar

[Verse 1]
El oro pa' quien lo quiera pero si hablamos de ayer
Es tanto lo que he bebido y sigo teniendo sed
Al menos tú lo sabías, al menos no te decía
Que las cosas no eran como parecían
Pero es que

[Chorus]
A la primera persona que me ayude a sentir otra vez
Pienso entregarle mi vida, pienso entregarle mi fe
Aunque si no eres la persona que soñaba para mí
¿Qué voy a hacer? Nada
¿Qué voy a hacer de los sueños?
¿Qué voy a hacer con aquellos besos?
¿Qué puedo hacer con todo aquello
Que soñamos, dime dónde lo metemos?

[Verse 2]
¿Dónde guardo la mirada que me diste alguna vez?
¿Dónde guardo las promesas, dónde guardo el ayer?
¿Dónde guardo niña tu manera de tocarme?
¿Dónde guardo mi fe?
Aunque lo diga la gente yo no lo quiero escuchar
No hay más miedo que el que se siente cuando ya no sientes na
Niña tú lo ves tan facil, ay amor
Pero es que cuanto más sencillo tú lo ves
Más dificil se me hace

[Chorus]
A la primera persona que me ayude a caminar
Pienso entregarle mi tiempo, pienso entregarle hasta el mar
Yo no digo que sea fácil pero niña
Ahora mismo ya no tengo ni siquiera dónde estar

[Chorus]
A la primera persona que no me quiera juzgar
Pienso entregarle caricias que yo tenia guarda's
Yo no pido que las cosas me salgan siempre bien
Pero es que ya estoy harto de perderte
Y a la primera persona que me lleve a la verdad
Pienso entregarle mi tiempo, no quiero esperar más
Yo no te entiendo cuando me hablas, qué mala suerte
Y tú dices que la vida tiene cosas así de fuertes

[Verse 3]
Yo te puedo contar cómo es una llama por dentro
Yo puedo decirte cuánto es que pesa su fuego
Y es que amar en soledad es como un pozo sin fondo
Donde ni existe ni dios, donde no existen verdades
Es todo tan relativo como que estamos aquí
No sabemos pero, amor, dame sangre para vivir
Al menos tú lo sabías, al menos no te decía
Que las cosas no eran como parecían y es que

[Chorus]
A la primera persona que no me quiera juzgar
Pienso entregarle caricias que yo tenia guarda's
Niña tú lo ves tan facil, ay amor
Pero es que cuanto más sencillo tú lo ves
Más dificil se me hace
A la primera persona que no me quiera juzgar
Pienso entregarle caricias que yo tenia guarda's
Yo no digo que sea fácil pero niña
Ahora mismo ya no tengo ni siquiera dónde estar
Ni siquiera dónde estar",Alejandro Sanz,2006,[100],1

Even tho I'm on the road doin' shows
I made time for me and her relationship to grow (grow)
They tell me don't trust the woman in this industry
But, she not any woman, more like a sacred friend to me

To all the fellaz, know you feel me, you ever had a woman

Nope
Didn't think so

How you doin', young lady?
That feeling that you giving really drives me crazy
You don't have a play about the joke
I was at a loss for words first time that we spoke
You lookin' for a girl that'll treat you right?
You lookin' for her in the daytime with the light?
You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night
You expect me to just let you hit it?
But will you still respect me if you get it?
All I can do is try, gimme one chance (Chance)
What's the problem? I don't see no ring on your hand (Hand)
I'll be the first to admit it
I'm curious about you, you seem so innocent
You wanna get in my world, get lost in it?
Boy, I'm tired of runnin', let's walk for a minute

Get you on my level, do you think that you can handle it?
They call me Thomas, last name Crown
Recognize game, I'ma lay mine's down
I'm a big girl, I can handle myself
But if I get lonely, I'ma need your help
Pay attention to me, I don't talk for my health
I want you on my team
So does everybody else

156,The Other Side Of Me,"You think you know me pretty well
But how can you tell
You never get inside my head

The times we talk
We never speak
We play hide and seek
So many things are left unsaid

Why can't you see
What's on the other side of me?
The side of me
That reaches out to you
Sweet thoughts and dreams
Like drops of rain on rippling streams
That wind and bend
Rivers with no end
Flowing on the other side of me

It seems I always get unstrung
I trip on my tongue
With words that come out something else
I'm so afraid the things I say
Might chase you away
I have to hide behind myself

Why can't you see
What's on the other side of me
The side of me
That reaches out to you
Why must I hide
These feelings that have been denied?
Only you can set me free
See what's on the other side of me

La la la la la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la

Why must I hide
These feelings that have been denied?

Though all the streets still look the same
Only memories remain
Gone are the folks I thought I knew so well

Heading for a new life here in our country
Different cultures, race and creed

And we'll build a better world to live in

To settle in this great land
To live in peace and harmony

Setting sail across the water

Prolly 'cause there's no umbrella to shield me from all the rain
Probably because you're the one playin' the mind games
You hate me because I don't let you play no mind games

171,Canadian Idiot,"[Verse 1]
Don't wanna be a Canadian idiot
Don't wanna be some beer-swillin' hockey nut
And do I look like some frostbitten hose-head?
I never learned my alphabet from A to Zed

[Chorus]
They all live on donuts and moose meat
And they leave the house without packin' heat
Never even bring their guns to the mall
And you know what else is too funny?
Their stupid Monopoly money
Can't take 'em seriously at all

[Verse 2]
Well, maple syrup and snow's what they export
They treat curling just like it's a real sport
They think their silly accent is so cute
Can't understand a thing they're talkin' aboot

[Chorus]
Sure, they've got their national healthcare
Cheaper meds, low crime rates and clean air
Then again, well, they've got Celine Dion
Eat their weight in Kraft macaroni
And dream of drivin' a Zamboni
All over Saskatchewan

[Verse 3]
Don't wanna be a Canadian idiot
Won't figure out their temperature in Celsius
See the map, they're hoverin' right over us
Tell you the truth, it makes me kinda nervous

[Chorus]
Always hear the same kind of story
Break their nose and they'll just say ""sorry""
Tell me what kind of freaks are that polite?
It's gotta mean they're all up to somethin'
So quick, before they see it comin'
Time for a pre-emptive strike!",“Weird Al” Yankovic,2006,"[98, 94, 82]",3

Just let your shoulder lean

[Verse 1: Young Dro]
Dro, I'm clean in this bitch
Now I'm finna shoulder lean in this bitch
Nigga buck, carbon 15 in this bitch
This Grand Hustle team of kings is getting rich
I lean and get lit, lima bean 6
I take breath, the opposite of Primatene Mist
I ride twenty-six and let my nine screens flip
Dro be watching Oprah, Mac 9 up in a clip
Triple black Phantom, nigga, nah, it ain't Tip
With Lucky Charms, diamonds, man, but nah, it ain't Flip
Can't bounce, okay, then I let my shoulder lean
And I bet my car talk, and I bet my motor clean
Suicide doors, brown Rover look like pork and beans
Everybody know me in the club cause they smoking me
Dro, hoes scoping me, ice come from Boca Raton
Hundred karats have 'em froze for an eon
Red, black, and white Chevy, now I'm riding Deion
Put them lights off in my rims, now I'm riding neon
Our cars look like cra-yon, hoes know I'm the man though
I can shoulder lean, I don't know how to dance though

[Hook x2: T.I.]

[Verse 2: Young Dro]
First, I let my wheels spin, then I let my screen fall
Then I let my trunk beat at Greenbriar Mall, tall
How can I pimp a ho? Take a bitch to Berlin
My bitch break niggas, after that we fuck they girlfriend
My girl got a girlfriend, Chevy blue like whirlwind
Nigga, it's a drought on that boy, so I got that girl in
Pearl Benz, cocking hammer, Arm & Hammer propaganda
Bitches think I'm pimping in linen and salamander sandals
Dirty South hot cause Atlanta, show niggas with ammo
We ride Phantom, holler shorty for grammar
Yep, now I be on TV, BET our channel
Hood nigga from Bankhead, I stay by Grandma Nana
I lay by my banana, dumping and punking monkeys
Don't nobody live with my mom but a bunch of junkies
Donut Dunkin', bitch, I ride glazed on the Haze

Guided by a beating heart

They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself

[Verse 2]
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
I hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
I wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game﻿ made for everyone
And love is the prize

Where the brave are free and lovers soar

We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today

If you're going my way I wanna drive it
All night long

A misunderstanding once
But now we look it in the eye

An empty room can be so deafening
The silence makes you wanna scream
It drives you crazy
I chased away the shadows of your name
And burned the picture in a frame
But it couldn't save me

[Pre-Chorus]
And how could we quit something we never even tried?
Well, you still can't tell me why

[Chorus]
We built it up to watch it fall
Like we meant nothing at all
I gave and gave the best of me
But couldn't give you what you need
You walked away
You stole my life
Just to find what your looking for
But no matter how I try
I can't hate you anymore
I can't hate you anymore
(Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
You're not the person who you used to be
The one I want who wanted me
And that's a shame, but
There's only so many tears that you can cry
Before it drains the light right from your eyes
And I can't go on that way

[Pre-Chorus]
And so I'm letting of everything we were (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It doesn't mean it doesn't hurt

You walked away

But no matter how I try
I can't hate you anymore

Sometimes you hold so tight, it slips right through your hands
Will I ever understand?

We built it up to watch it fall
Like we meant nothing at all
I gave and gave the best of me
But couldn't give you what you need
You walked away
You stole my life
Just to find what your looking for
But no matter how I try
I can't hate you anymore
We built it up to watch it fall

Sometimes you worry 'bout the things he can provide for ya
Whenever you around I seem to come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party, soft lips, soft spoken
I came and talked to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right
If I fell in love with you before I ever even knew

Club jumping, don't stop, off top
But you know we only go 'til 2 o'clock
Put yo motherfuckin' hood up, it's the weekend
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking
Last call at the bar, ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla cause you know they bout to cut the lights on

[Verse 2]
And put my number in it—
I'm staring at you from afar, I'm wondering 'bout you
Like, where you from and who you are?
'Cause you a star—no, not the type that snort the white lines
I mean the type to light the night time, I heard you got a man
But who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out your zone?
Now be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it
No question, I know destiny well
And though I sin the Lord blessing me still
Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday
They say it's just a matter of time
And if I had my way then you would be mine

Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama
She never knew that there was anything more than poor
What in the world, what does your company take me for?
Black bandana, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner
On her merry way sayin', ""Baby, what you gonna—?""

185,If You're Going Through Hell (Before The Devil Even Knows),"Well you know those times when you feel like
There's a sign there on your back
That says I don't mind if you kick me
Seems like everybody has
Things go from bad to worse
You think it can't get worse than that
And then they do

You step off the straight and narrow
And you don't know where you are
Used the needle of your compass
To sew up your broken heart
Ask directions from a genie in a bottle of jim beam
And she lies to you
That's when you learn the truth

[Chorus]

If you're goin' through hell keep on going
Don't slow down if you're scared don't show it
You might get out before the devil even knows you're there

I've been deep down in that darkness
I've been down to my last match
Felt a hundred different demons breathin' fire down my back
And I knew that if I stumbled I'd fall right into the trap
That they were layin'

But the good news is there's angels everywhere
Out on the street
Holdin' out a hand to pull you back up on your feet
The one's that you've been draggin' for so long
You're on your knees might as well be prayin'
Guess what I'm sayin'

[Chorus]

If you're goin' through hell keep on going
Don't slow down if you're scared don't show it
You might get out before the devil even knows you're there
When you're goin' through hell keep on movin'
Face that fire walk right through it
You might get out before the devil even knows you're there

If you're goin' through hell keep on going
Don't slow down if you're scared don't show it
You might get out before the devil even knows you're there

Mhmmm *inhales*
You high, baby?
Yeah
Yeah?
Talk to me
You want me to tell you something?
Uh-huh
I know what you wanna hear

[Refrain: Eminem (& Dina Rae)]
'Cause I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too
(I think I love you, baby) I think I love you too
I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me, baby, you know I want you too
They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
(Oh boy, you drive me crazy) Bitch, you make me hurl

[Verse 1: Eminem]
They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now: got no ring on this finger now
I'd never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship; save it, bitch!
Babysit? You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl, you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I tell a motherfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips? Bitch, why ask?
Kiss my dick, get my cash?
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out, I'll put you out
Won't get out, I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice? Buy you ice?
Bitch, if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What, you tryin' to be my new wife?
What, you Mariah? Fly through twice

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho

[Chorus: Eminem]
‘Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
It's no secret, everybody knows
Yeah, we fucked: bitch, so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends, I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kinda car I'll be in
We'll see how much you be'll partyin' then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?
I'd never love you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo

[Verse 3: Eminem]
First thing you say: I'm not fazed
I hang around big stars all day
I don't see what the big deal is anyway
You're just plain old Marshall to me
Ooh yeah, girl, run that game
Hailie Jade, I love that name
Love that tattoo, what's that say?
""Rot In Pieces,"" uh, that's great
First off, you don't know Marshall
At all, so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave handprints all across you
Good Lordy, whoadie
You must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooh girl, that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two backhands
Put anthrax on a Tampax
And slap you 'til you can't stand
Girl, you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans

193,Ni Una Sola Palabra,"[Letra de ""Ni Una Sola Palabra""]

[Intro]
Le está gritando y hace que no se entera
""Hey, corazón, escucha tu cabeza""
Pero, ¿a dónde vas? ¿Me estás escuchando?
¿Qué hay de tu orgullo? ¿Qué habíamos quedado?

[Verse 1]
La noche empieza y con ella mi camino
Te busco a solas con mi mejor vestido
Pero, ¿a dónde estás? ¿Qué es lo que ha pasado?
¿Qué es lo que queda después de tantos años?

Miro esos ojos que un día me miraron
Busco tu boca, tus manos, tus abrazos
Pero tú no sientes nada y te disfrazas de cordialidad

[Chorus]
Ni una sola palabra
Ni gestos, ni miradas apasionadas
Ni rastro de los besos que antes me dabas
Hasta el amanecer, eh, eh, eh (-Cer, eh, eh, eh)
Ni una de las sonrisas, por las que cada noche y todos los días
Sollozan estos ojos en los que ahora te ves

[Verse 2]
Como un juguete que choca contra un muro
Salgo a encontrarte y me pierdo en cuanto busco
Una oportunidad, un milagro o un hechizo
Volverme guapa y tú guapo conmigo

Frente a los ojos que un día me miraron
Pongo mi espalda y algunos cuantos pasos
Y me apunto otra derrota mientras mi boca dice ""Nunca más""

[Chorus]
Ni una sola palabra
Ni gestos, ni miradas apasionadas
Ni rastro de los besos que antes me dabas
Hasta el amanecer, eh, eh, eh (-Cer, eh, eh, eh)
Ni una de las sonrisas, por las que cada noche y todos los días
Sollozan estos ojos en los que ahora te ves

[Bridge]
No puede ser, no soy yo
Me pesa tanto el corazón
Por no ser de hielo cuando el cielo me pide paciencia

[Chorus]
Ni una sola palabra
Ni gestos, ni miradas apasionadas
Ni rastro de los besos que antes me dabas
Hasta el amanecer, eh, eh, eh (-Cer, eh, eh, eh)
Ni una de las sonrisas, por las que cada noche y todos los días
Sollozan estos ojos en los que ahora te ves

194,Bossy,"[Intro: Too $hort]
You know, it's a hard pill to swallow
When they tell you you strange
You ain't hot
Then in the blink of an eye
They got on what you got
That means I'm a boss

[Hook]
I'm bossy
I'm the first girl to scream on a track
I switched up the beat of the drum
That's right I brought all the boys to the yard
And that's right, I'm the one that's tattooed on his arm
I'm bossy
I'm the chick y'all love to hate
I'm the chick that's raised the stake
I told Young Stunna he should switch to BAPES
I'm back with an 808 cause I'm bossy

[Verse 1]
Ooh lemme slow it down for ya so you can catch the flow
Screw it up make it go extra slow
Real girls get down on the flo (on the flo get down, on the flo)
Ooh I gave you a taste you want some more
Touch down on it like a pro
I ride the beat like a bicycle, icicle
Ooh from the 6-4 hefers up in crenshaw
The money makin playas up in harlem
Don't want no problem
We gon keep it bumpin while the 808 is jumpin

[Bridge]
Diamonds on my neck, di-diamonds on my grill
Diamonds on my neck, di-diamonds on my grill

[Verse 2]
Ooh (i bet I bet I bet) I bet ya never heard it like this before
My baby be cruising them phantom doors
Got the bar popping this that you can't afford (can't afford)
Ooh I'm drinkin blasting the crowds it's all smoking
All the while I'm all open
Me and my girls we stay fly and we love to stay high
Ooh from the 6-4 hefers up in crenshaw
To the money makin playas up in harlem

It's bout time that she get with me

Damn girl, don't hurt em
Don't back that, you gon work em
Put your mack down, I know your background
What chu want girl, you gettin mad now
That's how you do it, huh?
Well I'm the coolest one
In fact, it's in the back bring 'em to the front
Tell that man you's a boss
Make some noise, raise your hand if you's a boss
I don't think he understand you's a boss
Get some help if you can cause he lost it

In your Benz with her friends in the fast lane

They tell me your passion's gone away

You tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carryin' on

Because you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me, don't lie

The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind

And heavens bowed before him

And how his children cried

Hey, Miss Murder, can I?
Hey, Miss Murder, can I?
Make beauty stay if I
Take my life?

[Bridge]
What's the hook, the twist
Within this verbose mystery?
I would gladly bet my life upon it
That the ghost you love, your ray of light
Will fizzle out without hope
We're the empty set just floating through, wrapped in skin
Ever searching for what we were promised
Reaching for that golden ring, we'd never let go
But who would ever let us put our filthy hands upon it?

[Chorus]
Hey, Miss Murder, can I?
Hey, Miss Murder, can I?
Make beauty stay if I
Take my life?
Hey, Miss Murder, can I?
Hey, Miss Murder, can I?
Make beauty stay if I
Take my life?

Story of my life
Searching for the right, but it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul, 'cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man, and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in, because I'm gone again
And to him, I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

I feel it in the air as I'm doin' my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy

Entre poème et vulgarité
J'nique mes rêves, et je ne crois pas aux chaînes de solidarité
Chacun pour soi, la pression est palpable
On est tous solitaire mais on se soigne par le partage

[Couplet Unique]
J'suis en pleine fuite, au moment où j'te parle
Faut pas qu'je sois en pleine cuite, que le bon Dieu m'épargne
J'me répare malgré la rue et ses méfaits
Dans une époque où c'qui est cru est plus important que ce qui est vrai
Tout c'qui m'effraie, c'est les refrés que nos légendes gênent
L'ultime séjour, les mauvais jours pour les gens qu'j'aime
Mon oxygène, c'est quand je veille près de vous
Et mon public est somnambule, je rappe des histoires à dormir debout
Alors j'me bouge entre dédales et cris d'colère
Entre étoiles et vie d'bohême, entre meilleurs freestyles et pires poèmes
J'ai mille problèmes, tant de soucis mais tellement d'inspi
Si j'avais eu un psy, il aurait eu besoin d'un psy
Tout ça m'inspire pour vivre et lutter, mes rimes sont réputées
Mais ce n'sont pas mes rimes qui vont vous éduquer
Ce rap game est truqué comme une pub
Ils prétendent tous faire du lourd alors je reviens léger comme une plume
Le passé lourd comme une enclume, mes démons me l'apprennent
Demain c'est loin, notre futur c'est la seconde d'après
J'étais pas prêt, sorti des bas-fonds
L'histoire : y a ceux qui la lisent, ceux qui l'écrivent, et y a ceux qui la font
Toucher l'plafond, rêveur et indépendant
Être patient, c'est pas attendre, pour moi, c'est agir en attendant
Alors pendant que ce pays me prend pour un intrus
J'prends mon temps, en dilettante, laisse tourner l'instru
J'suis paro comme un stup sur le déclin
Selon l'humeur, j'écris des vers à moitié vides, ou à moitié pleins
Plein d'ironie, mes contradictions deviennent des impasses
Moi, j'suis un genre d'alcoolique avec une licence IV
Je suis d'une puissance calme, ne porte pas de gun
Silencieuses sont les batailles, alors fermez vos gueules
Vous n'êtes pas seuls, n'ayez pas peur, on tolère tous les genres
J'fais pas du rap pour les rappeurs, j'fais du rap pour les gens
C'est pour les bêtes et méchants, les têtes et les jambes
Les thèmes, et les textes de légende
Qu'on a écrit pour s'engager
Même si je sais qu'on peut avoir le bon message tout en restant un mauvais messager
J'viens d'cracher mes états d'âmes, et mes cas d'conscience
Y'a que les connards qui vont croire que c'est du rap conscient
Pourtant, j'n'ai pas confiance, même en mes propres dires
Entre rires de déprime et larmes de crocodiles
Pas de gros deal, que des risques forts
Maint'nant qu'j'ai plus de maison d'disques, j'ai une maison de disques d'or
Triste sort face au charbon, il fallait du cran
Mais je cherche pas à être bon, je cherche à être grand
J'ai pas de clan, j'préfère éviter ; parano
Je crois toujours aux mensonges et doute souvent de la vérité
Quelle idée, vu qu'ici je tourne dans le même schéma
Parfois, je doute, parfois, je pense à retourner chez moi
Laissez-moi libérer mon gospel
La France ne reconnaît pas les communautés mais nous traite comme telles
Quand les gens sont boycottés, forcément, ils se lassent
Quand on met les gens de côté, forcément, ils s'éloignent
C'est pas les lois qui font les hommes, c'est l'inverse
On témoigne, sans respect, un signe de paix sans l'index
Sans déc, les beaux parleurs peuvent mentir, c'est les actions qui comptent
J'écoute pas ce que les gens disent, je regarde ce qu'ils font
J’m'en bats de ce qu'ils sont, j'ne vois qu'un cœur
Quand on voyage, le monde devient plus petit alors il fait moins peur
Viens, on prend de l'ampleur, quoi, viens, on fait une pause
Et, si y'a quelqu'un près de toi, check-le de l'épaule
Et je me pose, authentique dès le départ
C'est plus facile d'assumer ce qu'on est que d'imiter ce qu'on n'est pas
Que Dieu m'épargne de l'aigreur de perdre ma voix
Et qu'il m'épargne de l'erreur de perdre ma foi
Vous êtes ma flamme, je suis fou et malhonnête
Mais, tous les jours, je me soigne et j'apprends à vous connaître
Comme dit le poète : je le cite et je le chante
Faudrait essayer d'être heureux, ne serait ce que pour donner l'exemple
Ça tourne comme un sample, de Paris à Dakar
L'amour nous manque, prends ce texte comme une Sadaqa
On reste calme avant le carnage, qui m'aime me suive
Je cherche la paix pour mon Karma, moi-même, je suis

I don't have time to go round and round and round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn’t if I could
‘Cause I'm mad as hell
Can't bring myself to do what it is you think I should
I know you said
Can't you just get over it
It turned my whole world around
And I kind of like it
I made my bed and I sleep like a baby
With no regrets and I don’t mind sayin'
It’s a sad sad story when a mother will teach her
Daughter that she ought to hate a perfect stranger
And how in the world can the words that I said
Send somebody so over the edge
That they’d write me a letter
Sayin’ that I better shut up and sing
Or my life will be over
I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down

동네 친구 얘기에 다시 보기를 결제
친구 친구였던 놈들이 거기서 경쟁해
난 심취했고 맘 비우고 봤어 대박 친 drama
이번 시즌에는 나는 어떤 역이 될까
검색 검색해 Naver, Facebook, Instagram
그 많은 랩퍼 뭐 해 먹고사나 궁금해
누군 강남 홍대 클럽 죽돌이가 됐대
누군 음원 갱스터 혹은 예술가가 됐네
행사 좀 뛰었대 근데 길어봐야 삼 개월
무료 공개 벌스 몇 개 내고 허송세월 야

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE]
We get the job done

[HAMILTON]
So what happens if we win?

[LAFAYETTE]
I go back to France
I bring freedom to my people if I’m given the chance

I am not throwin’ away my shot!
I am not throwin’ away my shot!

Scrappy and hungry
And I’m not throwin’ away my shot!
I am not throwin’ away my shot!

‘Til the world turns upside down…

‘Til the world turns upside down!

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
This is where it gets me: on my feet
The enemy ahead of me
If this is the end of me, at least I have a friend with me
Weapon in my hand, a command, and my men with me
Then I remember my Eliza’s expecting me...
Not only that, my Eliza’s expecting
We gotta go, gotta get the job done
Gotta start a new nation, gotta meet my son!
Take the bullets out your gun!

[ENSEMBLE]
What?

[HAMILTON]
The bullets out your gun!

[ENSEMBLE]
What?

[HAMILTON]
We move under cover and we move as one
Through the night, we have one shot to live another day
We cannot let a stray gunshot give us away
We will fight up close, seize the moment and stay in it
It’s either that or meet the business end of a bayonet
The code word is ‘Rochambeau,’ dig me?

[ENSEMBLE]
Rochambeau!

[HAMILTON]
You have your orders now, go, man, go!
And so the American experiment begins
With my friends all scattered to the winds
Laurens is in South Carolina, redefining brav’ry

[HAMILTON/LAURENS]
We’ll never be free until we end slavery!

[HAMILTON]
When we finally drive the British away
Lafayette is there waiting—

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE]
In Chesapeake Bay!

[HAMILTON]
How did we know that this plan would work?
We had a spy on the inside. That’s right

[HAMILTON/COMPANY]
Hercules Mulligan!

[MULLIGAN]
A tailor spyin’ on the British government!
I take their measurements, information and then I smuggle it

[COMPANY]
Up

[MULLIGAN]
To my brother's revolutionary covenant
I’m runnin’ with the Sons of Liberty and I am lovin’ it!
See, that’s what happens when you up against the ruffians
We in the shit now, somebody gotta shovel it!
Hercules Mulligan, I need no introduction
When you knock me down I get the fuck back up again!

[COMPANY]
Left! Right! Hold!
Go!
What! What! What!

[HAMILTON]
After a week of fighting, a young man in a red coat stands on a parapet

[LAFAYETTE]
We lower our guns as he frantically waves a white handkerchief

[MULLIGAN]
And just like that, it’s over. We tend to our wounded, we count our dead

[LAURENS]
Black and white soldiers wonder alike if this really means freedom

[WASHINGTON]
Not. Yet

[HAMILTON]
We negotiate the terms of surrender
I see George Washington smile
We escort their men out of Yorktown
They stagger home single file
Tens of thousands of people flood the streets
There are screams and church bells ringing
And as our fallen foes retreat
I hear the drinking song they’re singing…

[ALL MEN]
The world turned upside down

The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down

218,Summertime,"[Intro]
Drums Please!

[Hook]
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

[Verse 1]
Here it is the groove slightly transformed
Just a bit of a break from the norm
Just a little somethin' to break the monotony
Of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be
A little bit out of control it's cool to dance
But what about the groove that soothes that moves romance
Give me a soft subtle mix
And if ain't broke then don't try to fix it
And think of the summers of the past
Adjust the bass and let the Alpine blast
Pop in my CD and let me run a rhyme
And put your car on cruise and lay back 'cause this is summertime

[Hook]
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

[Verse 2]
School is out and it's a sort of a buzz
But back then I didn't really know what it was
But now I see what have of this
The way that people respond to summer madness
The weather is hot and girls are dressin' less
And checkin' out the fellas to tell 'em who's best
Riding around in your Jeep or your Benzos
Or in your Nissan sittin' on Lorenzos
Back in Philly we be out in the park
A place called the Plateau is where everybody goes
Guys out huntin' and girls doin' likewise
Honkin' at the honey in front of you with the light eyes
She turn around to see what you beepin' at
It's like the summer's a natural aphrodisiac
And with a pen and pad I compose this rhyme
To hip you and to get you equipped for the summertime

[Hook]
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

[Verse 3]
It's late in the day and I ain't been on the court yet
Hustle to the mall to get me a short set
Yeah I got on sneaks but I need a new pair
Cause basketball courts in the summer got girls there
The temperature's about 88
Hop in the water plug just for old times sake
Break to ya crib change your clothes once more
Cause you're invited to a barbecue that's startin' at 4
Sittin' with your friends cause y'all reminisce
About the days growin' up and the first person you kiss
And as I think back makes me wonder how
The smell from a grill could spark up nostalgia
All the kids playin' out front
Little boys messin' round with the girls playing double-dutch
While the DJ's spinnin' a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion
Then six o'clock rolls around
You just finished wipin' your car down
It's time to cruise so you go to the summertime hangout
It looks like a car show
Everybody come lookin' real fine
Fresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon
Every moment frontin' and maxin'
Chillin' in the car they spent all day waxin'
Leanin' to the side but you can't speed through
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
There's an air of love and of happiness
And this is the Fresh Prince's new definition of summer madness

219,Why You Wanna,"[Produced by Kevin ""Khao"" Cates]

[Intro]
Hey, T.I.P. pimpin'
Hey, shorty, why you gotta act like that?
I'm sayin', I'm just tryin' to be nice to you

[Chorus]
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye

[Verse 1]
Can't help but notice how you glowing, I can see in yo' face
Now, I just wonder if he know he close to being replaced
Swear I treat you like a queen you put me in his place
So you can give back his ring and the key to his place
Tell the nigga one thing, that you need your space
Selling niggas one thing, you don't need to chase
I wanna kiss you everywhere between your knees and waist
Hear the sounds that you making, get your knees to shake
Holla at me in the A, you feel you need to escape
I got a mansion and a gate, you with me and you safe
A Benz, a Phantom and a truck with 23's the case
600 G's in the safe, how much cheese it take?
This a chance you need to take, ain't no need to wait
Say the word, we can leave today, this song's special
And it feel like fate, hate to make a mistake
How the same thing making you sad making you stay?

[Chorus]
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye

[Verse 2]
Can he touch it like that, and make it feel like this?
How I left and came back and it's still like this?
Do he hit it from the back and make you feel it in your chest?
Take advantage of what you're concealing in your dress?
What, he think he too fresh to show that you the best?
Compliment you on your intellect and treat you with respect?
Give you sex 'til you sweat, tongue kissing on your neck?
It's been awhile since she got it like this, I bet
I can tell you ain't just another bitch I met
Ain't nobody got me open like this, not yet
You confused, ain't decided which way you should go yet
So how you keep saying no with your panties so wet?

[Chorus]
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye

[Interlude]
Ay, this nigga playing mind games, man
I think the time came that your mind changed, you understand?
Life is like a chess move
You need to make your next move your best move
Keep it pimpin', you understand? Hey
I mean, you know what I'm saying
I done showed you how I feel, you know what I'm saying
I put myself all the way out there, you know
The ball in your court, man
But I just got a question for you: Is you happy?

[Chorus]
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack

I'm over here you over there I ain't picking up my phone

Don't always tell you what I do I know you care
But I'm just trying get the bag I know its there
I sent you out to get a bag and do ya hair
I know you figured that it's sad and it ain't fair
But if a nigga get you mad you know I'm there
So baby you should trust me, you fucking with a star
Girl you lucky
You would you would be a fool if you dub me
I just came out here looking busty so I'm getting money
Bitches wanna fuck me, and you should understand
If you love me that I'm just trying do the best I can
I got caught up in the moment the one night stands
The one night stands but..

[Verse 3]
I remember in the crib you was showing me the tricks
And your spits made a nigga wanna kid, i was rolling that spliff while you riding my dick
Feel ashamed that I came that quick
Now you got me reminiscing bout the days I miss
Other hoes play a part but they ain't my bitch
They just wanna see us ruin our relationship
Swear they wanna see us ruin our relationship
But I love them good vibes that's what I deserve
Even though sometimes you irk me and you get on my nerves
I could always make it better when I lift up ya skirt
It surfs, yeah getting busy and I make that thing squirt
Team work make the dream work, now I need a clean T-shirt
Pussy tasted like a Tropicana out the freezer and
When I see you, I know these bitches wanna be you
And they don't even know about that Hurricane Katrina
How I knock it out like we up in the arena
I had them toes curled, but you ain't no ballerina
Yeah that's mine and I love her like my Nina
I keep her looking fly she might just pass it if you see her

[Bridge]
Man slow down, speed it up, slow down, speed it up
Matter fact lay down lemme eat it up
Pu punani with strawberry it’s a decent lunch and I

221,Swing,"[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
When we were kids, we handpainted strawberries on a swing
Every moment was so precious, then
I'm still kicking, I'm daydreaming on a strawberry swing
The entire Earth is fighting, all the world is at its end
Just in case an atom bomb comes falling on my lawn
I should say and you should hear, I've loved
I've loved the good times here, I've loved our good times here

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Say hello, then say farewell to the places you know
We are all mortals, aren't we? Any moment this could go
Cry, cry, cry, ohh, even though that won't change a thing
But you should know, you should hear, that I have loved
I have loved the good times here, and I will miss our good times here

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
Spaceships are lifting off of a dying world
And millions are left behind while the sky burns
There wasn't room for you and I, only you, goodbye, goodbye

[Outro: Coldplay]
Ah, now the sky could be blue, I don’t mind
Without you it’s a waste of time
Could be blue, I don’t mind
Without you it’s a waste of time
The sky could be blue, could be gray
Without you I'm just miles away
The sky could be blue, I don’t mind
Without you it’s a waste of time

This heart of mine
Would take you back every time

A nervous wreck, a day ago
Now you have got no business coming around
I am closing up shop
Shutting us down

It ain't no walkin' round me, see all these killers round me
Lotta drug dealin' 'round me goin' down in Dade County
Don't tote no twenty-twos, Magnum cost me twenty-two
Sat it on them 22's, birds go for 22
Lil' mama super thick, she say she 22
She seen them 22's, we in room 222
I touch work like I'm Convertible Burt
I got distribution so I'm convertin' the work
In the M.I.YAYO, them niggas rich off that yayo
Steady slangin' yayo, my Chevy bangin' Yayo

227,Labios Compartidos,"[Letra de ""Labios Compartidos""]

[Verso 1]
Amor mío
Si estoy debajo del vaivén de tus piernas
Si estoy hundido en un vaivén de caderas
Esto es el cielo, es mi cielo

[Verso 2]
Amor fugado
Me tomas, me dejas, me exprimes y me tiras a un lado
Te vas a otros cielos y regresas, como los colibríes
Me tienes como un perro a tus pies

[Pre-Coro]
Otra vez mi boca insensata
Vuelve a caer en tu piel
Vuelve a mí tu boca y provoca
Vuelvo a caer de tus pechos a tu par de pies

[Coro]
Labios compartidos
Labios divididos, mi amor
Yo no puedo compartir tus labios
Y comparto el engaño
Y comparto mis días y el dolor
Yo no puedo compartir tus labios
Oh, amor
Oh, amor compartido

[Verso 3]
Amor mutante
Amigos con derecho y sin derecho de tenerte siempre
Y siempre tengo que esperar paciente
El pedazo que me toca de ti

[Verso 4]
Relámpagos de alcohol
Las voces solas lloran en el sol (eh!)
Mi boca en llamas torturada
Te desnudas angelada
Luego te vas

[Pre-Coro]
Otra vez mi boca insensata
Vuelve a caer en tu piel de miel
Vuelve a mí tu boca, duele
Vuelvo a caer de tus pechos a tu par de pies

[Coro]
Labios compartidos
Labios divididos, mi amor
Yo no puedo compartir tus labios
Y comparto el engaño
Y comparto mis días y el dolor
Ya no puedo compartir tus labios
Que me parta un rayo
Que me entierre al olvido, mi amor
Pero no puedo más compartir tus labios
Compartir tus besos...
Labios compartidos
Ooh oh yeah!

Te amo con toda mi fe sin medida
Te amo aunque estés compartida
Tus labios tienen el control

If you take a chance to let me put them thangs on you
I could show you why I make them straight A's at school
I'm a hustler, trust my frame and age
Got you thinking that I'm just too young to turn your page
I can picture us switching lanes
In the coupe, with you on the phone screaming my name (Chris!)

Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
She said, ""Some days, I feel like shit
Some days, I wanna quit and just be normal for a bit.""
I don't understand why you have to always be gone
I get along, but the trips always feel so long
And I find myself trying to stay by the phone
'Cause your voice always helps me not to feel so alone
But I feel like an idiot, working my day around the call
But when I pick up, I don't have much to say

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here, singing ""where'd you go?""

[Chorus: Skylar Grey & Jonah Matranga]
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Come back home, you know, the place where you used to live
Used to barbeque up burgers and ribs
Used to have a little party every Halloween
With candy by the pile, but now
You only stop by every once in a while
Shit, I find myself just filling my time
With anything to keep the thought of you from my mind
I'm doing fine, and I'm I planning to keep it that way
You can call me if you find you have something to say

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
And I'll tell you, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here, singing ""where'd you go?”

[Chorus: Skylar Grey & Jonah Matranga]
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, no longer debating
Tired of sitting and hating and making these excuses
For why you're not around, and feeling so useless
It seems one thing has been true, all along
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess I've had it with you and your career
When you come back, I won't be here and you can sing it

[Chorus: Skylar Grey & Jonah Matranga]
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone

Sometimes it's just plain hard
Life can knock you down, it can break your heart

Life ain't always beautiful
You think you're on your way
And it's just a dead end road at the end of the day

But the struggle makes you stronger
And the changes make you wise
And happiness has its own way of takin' its sweet time

No, life ain't always beautiful
Tears will fall sometimes
Life ain't always beautiful, but it's a beautiful ride

Life ain't always beautiful
Some days I miss your smile
I get tired of walkin' all these lonely miles

And I wish for just one minute
I could see your pretty face
Guess I can dream, but life don't work that way

But the struggles makes me stronger
And the changes make me wise
And happiness has its own way of takin' its sweet time

Like they have any right at all to criticize

May he turn 21 on the base at Fort Bliss
Just today he sat down to the flask in his fist
""Ain't been sober since maybe October of last year""
Here in town, you can tell he's been down for a while
But my god, it's so beautiful when the boy smiles
Wanna hold him, maybe, I'll just sing about it

2 AM and I'm still awake, writing a song
If I get it all down on paper, it's no longer inside of me
Threatening the life it belongs to

And I know that you'll use them, however you want to

Always wait so patiently, thinkin'
You was comin' home to me
Well, damn, I never heard the keys
Or felt ya taps sayin', ""Are you asleep?""

Don't wanna play house no more
So dumb to think you gon' marry me
I got to be out my mind to think
I need someone to carry me
I've done enough cryin', cryin', cryin'

It's time I do something for me

[Verse 2]
It's time I choose my clothes
Choose my friends, be with my family
They been askin' ""Girlfriend, where you been?""
We ain't seen you in weeks
Been chasin' this fool around
Thinkin' he gon' hold me down
I would follow his lead
Thinkin' I would be the one he keep around

[Verse 3]
When I ain't need it, not ya finance
And all that I needed, real commitment
I really couldn't see it, not the real man
You said you was be in this relationship

That all a girl needs
Is to be sold a dream
But I won't fall for it

I got to be out my mind to think I need someone to carry me

This ain't yours so let me come in

Don't wanna play house no more
No more, tired of you playin' me
I've done enough cryin', cryin', cryin'
It's time I do something for me

[Verse 5]
You turned your back, and back I came running
But the simple fact is that you ain't want me
Done enough lying and crying to myself
Nothing left to do but move
What else can I do but leave?
I believed that you would marry me, but now I gotta breeze
I be's with LT when you come to your senses
But then it's too late
That's always how it be
Catch me with the B's on the wheels, gizeppi's on the hills
Shoulda Marc Jacob Fe Fe bagged me when you had me
Next dude will gladly pick up where you left off
Ice me, wife me, you ain't gonna have me

Watch my life pass me by
In the rear view mirror
Pictures frozen in time, are becoming clearer
I don't wanna waste another day
Stuck in the shadow of my mistakes

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause I want you, and I feel you
Crawling underneath my skin
Like a hunger, like a burning
To find a place I've never been
Now I'm broken, and I'm fading
I'm half the man I thought I would be
But you can have what's left of me

[Verse 2]
I've been dying inside
Little by little
No where to go, but going out of my mind
In endless circles
Running from myself until
You gave me a reason for standing still

[Chorus]
And I want you, and I feel you
Crawling underneath my skin
Like a hunger, like a burning
To find a place I've never been
Now I'm broken, and I'm fading
I'm half the man I thought I would be
But you can have what's left of me

[Bridge]
Falling faster, barely breathing
Give me something to believe in
Tell me it's not all in my head
Take what's left
Of this man
Make me whole, once again

'Cause I want you, and I feel you
Crawling underneath my skin
A hunger, like a burning
To find a place I've never been
Now I'm broken, and I'm fading

238,Invisible,"[Verse 1]
I've got an aching head
Echoes and buzzing noises
I know the words we said
But wish I could've turned our voices down
This is not black and white
Only organized confusion
I'm just trying to get it right
And in spite of all I should've done

[Pre-Chorus]
I was not mad at you
I was not trying to tear you down
The words that I could've used
I was too scared to say out loud
If I cannot break your fall
I'll pick you up right off the ground
If you felt invisible, I won't let you feel that now

[Chorus]
Invisible, invisible
Invisible, invisible

[Verse 2]
You didn't get your way
And it's an empty feeling
You've got a lot to say
And you just want to know you're being heard
But this is not black and white
There are no clear solutions
I'm just trying to get it right
And in spite of all I should've done

[Pre-Chorus]
I was not mad at you
I was not trying to tear you down
The words that I could've used
I was too scared to say out loud

239,Don't Forget To Remember Me,"[Verse 1]
18 years have come and gone
For mama they flew by
But for me they drug on and on
We were loading up that Chevy
Both trying not to cry
Mama kept on talking
Putting off good-bye
And she took my hand and said
""Baby, don't forget""

[Verse 2]
Before you hit the highway
You better stop for gas
There's a 50 in the ashtray
In case you run short on cash
Here's a map, and here's a Bible
If you ever lose your way

[Interlude]
Just one more thing before you leave:
Don't forget to remember me

[Verse 3]
This downtown apartment sure makes me miss home
And those bills there on the counter
Keep telling me I'm on my own
And just like every Sunday, I called mama up last night
And even when it's not, I tell her everything's alright
Before we hung up, I said
""Hey mama, don't forget

[Chorus 2]
To tell my baby sister, I'll see her in the fall
And tell Meemaw that I miss her
Yeah, I should give her a call
And make sure you tell Daddy
That I'm still his little girl
Yeah, I still feel like I'm where I'm supposed to be
But don't forget to remember me""

[Verse 4]
Tonight I find myself kneeling by the bed to pray
I haven't done this in a while
So I don't know what to say
But ""Lord, I feel so small sometimes
In this big old place
Yeah, I know there's more important things
But don't forget to remember me
Don't forget to remember me""",Carrie Underwood,2006,"[80, 74, 66, 56, 56, 56, 57, 54, 54, 50, 49, 55, 78, 84, 84, 93, 98]",17

241,When The Stars Go Blue,"[Verse 1]
Dancing where the stars go blue
Dancing where the evening fell
Dancing in your wooden shoes
In a wedding gown

[Verse 2]
Dancing out on 7th street
Dancing through the underground
Dancing little marionette
Are you happy now?

Where do you go when you're lonely
Where do you go when you're blue
Where do you go when you're lonely
I'll follow you
When the stars go blue

Laughing with your broken eyes
Laughing with your lover's tongue
In a lullaby

242,Every Time I Hear Your Name,"[Verse 1]
Finally got over that song of ours
Stopped chasin' little red sports cars
To check the license plates
And back wood drivin' by your place
Back makin' the rounds at our old haunts
Honky Tonks, restaurants
And seein' some of our old friends
It feels good to dance again
And I can finally smell your perfume
And not look around the room for you
And I can walk right by your picture in a frame
And not feel a thing, but when I hear your name

[Chorus]
I feel rain falling right out of the blue sky
And it's the fifth of May and I'm right there staring in your eyes
And nothing's change and we're still the same
And I get lost in the innocence of a first kiss
And I'm hanging onto every word running off of your lips
And that's all it takes and I'm in that place
Every time I hear your name

[Verse 2]
Got someone special in my life
Everyone thinks she'd make a great wife
Dad says he thinks she's the one
Reminds him of Mom when she was young
But it's way too soon to be talking 'bout rings
Don't wanna rush into anything
She's getting over someone too
Dinda like me and you
And she talks about him every once in a while
And I just nod my head an' smile
'Cause I know exactly what she's goin' through
Yeah, I've been there too
And when the conversation turns to you

[Chorus]
I get caught in a ""you were the only one for me""
Kinda thought, and your face is all that I see
I know I can't go back when I still go back
And there we are, a point down by the riverside
And I'm in your arms about to make love for the first time
And that's all it takes, and I'm in that place
Every time I hear your name

[Bridge]
So I'm thinkin' 'bout the words I left unsaid
(Every time I hear your name)
Stop tryin' to change the things I can't change
(Every time I hear your name)
In my heart, I know you're gone, but in my head

[Chorus]
I feel rain falling right out of the blue sky
And it's the fifth of May and I'm right there staring in your eyes
That's all it takes and I'm in that place
And there we are, a point down by the riverside
And I'm in your arms about to make love for the first time
And I can't explain, but I'm in that place
Every time I hear your name

In the paper today, tales of war and of waste
But you turn right over to the TV page

Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
We know they won't win

Now I'm walking again to the beat of a drum
And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
Only shadows ahead, barely clearing the roof
Get to know the feeling of liberation and release

Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
You know they won't win

246,Hanging On,"[Verse 1: Ellie Goulding]
You know we can get away
Because I'm calling your name
Every day I feel this pain
But you just turn and walk away

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
No, I just can't keep hanging on
To you and me
I just don't know what is wrong
With you and me

Tell me if you feel this pain
Cause I don't wanna be a ball and chain

No, I just can't keep hanging on
To you and...
I just don't know what is wrong

[Verse 3: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, give me that respect, forgive me and forget
You've got to get a grip, living on the edge
I barely even know this fucking woman in my bed
And if there is too much on my plate then I ain't finishing my veg
And if anybody said the grass is greener on the other side
Well it ain't, swear on my mother's life
You got me wrapped up in your shit, I'm feeling mummified
I've only ever had this fucking feeling in my stomach twice
You gave me what I needed and I gave her everything she wanted
There's something 'bout your cleavage, now I can't put my fingers on it
Been taking me the deepest, I thought that she was gonna vomit
If all women are from Venus then I guess I really got a rocket
You've got a noose around my neck but I'm still hanging on
We've nearly reached the finish line up in our marathon
I spat a verse, she sang a song
She broke my heart, I took some Gaviscon

The one to raise my hand
That was not me
And now that's who I am
Because of you
I am standing tall

My heart is full
Of endless gratitude
You were the one
The one to guide me through

And I believe

But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now
Never been afraid of standing out
But do I make you proud?

[Verse 3]
I guess I've learned
To question is to grow
That you still have faith
Is all I need to know
I've learned to love
Myself in spite of me
And I've learned to
Walk on the road that I believe

[Chorus]
This is what we dream about
But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now
Never been afraid of standing out
But do I make you proud?

Everybody needs to rise up
Everybody needs to be loved
To be loved

But the only question with me now
Is do I make you proud
Stronger than I've ever been now (stronger than I've ever been)
Never been afraid of standing out (never been afraid)

Though hit and all though back's about wit memories

An uneasiness kept here
Even after we made this big giant step here

Although the honey aim style king
Would of took groomin' and tamin' the wild thing
Loud, uneasiness brought out
Still tried to shove my tongue down the bushy broad mouth
Speedin', chasin' after vacant
Tried to string along but I didn't have the patience

I would not cry
'Cause I’ve been waitin' for it
Waitin' for it
Instead I’m sure I'd jump for joy
And reach the sky
'Cause I've been dyin' for it
Dyin' for it

And I know that there are those
That say He lied
He was a false teacher

Once I put my faith in man
And things done by hand
And found that I
Was wrong again
Wrong again
Then I thought it must be in trees
And pretty things that help us breathe
But I was wrong again
Wrong again

And I know that there are those
That say He lied
He was a false teacher
But I know if you looked Him
Straight in your eyes
You'd find that He
Holds the keys
To your light...

And I know
That you try
Everything you've done
At least once or twice
And I know
There’s no joy
Left within you
So why not try Him
And let Him take away
All your sin

Let Him take it away
Let Him take it away

I wear my chains everywhere except the showers
Dealer man said they’d turn green on me
But I don’t got too much green in my vision now
So I’ma rock these boys until they turn green on me
She asked if I had plans of being intimate
What you think, you get a Benz without benefits?
What you think I’m interested in your interests?
I don’t ever invest without interest
And look what love got us, man what you expect?
As far as to look at these girls and have no respect
I used to think they was aiming at the heart…
But these girls straight up aiming at your neck, huh?!
Said throw some titles on these songs, man, give them purpose
I just kept these Beats on and let my feelings surface
They saluting at a nigga like I’m in the service

Maybe cause I never settle, like a nomad…
Maybe cause I get them open as a toe strap

Ball so hard I need two sports; Bo Jackson
Beating Mikes up like I’m Joe Jackson
Swear I’m reading through these niggas like closed captions
All I need is one reason
Don’t believe in off seasons
And I be here all weekend
I should be number one
Man, that’s what we’re all thinking
Yeah, I know you’re tired of dreaming
Your nightmares is real
I know you’re hiding your demons
But we’re gonna make it

You better pray your plans don’t interfere with ours

This is black hoodie rap
Hats low and solars on
Just a star, trying to get my super nova on
Tell me something, have you ever felt overgrown?
Just a matter of time before The Throne gets overthrown
Love is love, it’s no love for liars
You dudes wouldn’t last
I’d throw you into the fire
Make a second round and kill off all the survivors
Snatch your soul out of your True Religion designers…
They say that want that real back, they’re fiending for it
This Martin is Margiela, no Gina for it

I must look just like a fool here
In the middle of the road

The slightest sign that you might miss
What you left behind

But I'd settle for a slowdown

I held on longer than I should
Believing you might change your mind
And those bright lights of Hollywood
Would fade in time

But your wheels just turn
Down the road ahead

You ain't showed it yet

Come on tap those brakes

To fight for the red, white and blue
He was 19 and green with a new M-16
Just doing what he had to do
He was dropped in the jungle where the choppers would rumble
With the smell of napalm in the air
And the sergeant said...look up ahead
Like a dark evil cloud, 1,200 came down on him and 29 more
They fought for their lives but most of them died in the 173rd Airborne

As they carried his brothers away
With the fire raining down and the hell all around
There were few men left standing that day
Saw the eagle fly through a clear blue sky

Now he's 58 and his pony tail's gray
But the battle still plays in his head
He limps when he walks but he's strong when he talks
About the Shrapnel they left in his leg
He puts on a gray suit over his Airborne tattoo
And he ties it on one time a year
And remembers the fallen as he orders a tall one
And swallows it down with his tears

Why am I so in love?

[Verse]
Steady tryin' to maintain
Same things that'll blow a bitch mind frame
My brain can't fathom what the hate say
He say, she say, how 'bout me say?
Get the Vis-a, headed to the islands A-S-A-P
What's that on my shawty wrist? That's a AP
I'm the type to save a bitch, C-A-P-E
Feelin' like ET, flyin' out of the Addy
Fuckin' on shawty, she baddie, casual convo then at it
I mean I'm better than better, maybe I'm lyin'
I'm sadder than most of y'all with the money and the freedom, nigga
What is money really worth if it ain't love?
I'ma find a perfect balance, it's gon' take time
I heard shawty still in love through the grapevine
Heard shawty still in love through the grapevine
Heard shawty in love through the grapevine

269,Who Says You Can't Go Home,"[Verse 1]
I spent 20 years trying to get out of this place
I was looking for something I couldn't replace
I was running away from the only thing I've ever known
Like a blind dog without a bone
I was a gypsy lost in the twilight zone
I hijacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold
I been there, done that and I ain't looking back on the seeds I've sown
Saving dimes, spending too much time on the telephone
Who says you can't go home

[Chorus]
Who says you can't go home
There's only one place they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy, born a rolling stone, who says you can't go home
Who says you can't go back, been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I want to go, who says you can't go home
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, its alright

[Verse 2]
I went as far as I could, I tried to find a new face
There isn't one of these lines that I would erase
I lived a million miles of memories on that road
With every step I take I know that I'm not alone
You take the home from the boy, but not the boy from his home
These are my streets, the only life I've ever known
Who says you can't go home

[Chorus]
Who says you can't go home
There's only one place they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy, born a rolling stone, who says you can't go home
Who says you can't go back, been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I want to go, who says you can't go home
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, its alright

[Verse 3]
I been there, done thatand I ain't looking that
It's been a long long road
Feels like I never left, that's how the story goes
It doesn't matter where you are, it doesn't matter where you go
If it's a million miles aways or just a mile up the road
Take it in, take it with you when you go
Who says you can't go home

[Chorus]
Who says you can't go home
There's only one place they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy, born a rolling stone, who says you can't go home
Who says you can't go back, been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I want to go, who says you can't go home

It isn't worth the fight
Don't make waves and don't look back
And you'll be fine, yeah, right

Turns out that's not who I am
Or who I want to be
So I'm gonna try to simplify
And be the perfectly imperfect me

I'm flying blind, but I know I'll find my destiny
I'm ready to do whatever it takes, my destiny
And I'm not afraid of making mistakes
It might not be smart to lead with my heart
But that's how it's gonna be
No dream too small
Giving it my all
That's my destiny

Every day's a crazy ride
But I'll stay strong because I

I decide my destiny
Facing a long and difficult climb, my destiny
Learning to trust the mysteries of time
There's not much of a plot, so like it or not
Gonna have to wait and see
I'll rise, I'll fall
And heed the call
That's my destiny",Dove Cameron,2006,"[79, 60]",2

Not a thing in the world could get between what we share
No matter where you at, no worry I'll be there
No one's got your back like I do
Even when the business ain't going well, we still cool
When I shine, you shine, always on your side
All my life you'll have what's mine
Mark my word, we gon' be alright

They traveled about

273,Angelito,"[Letra de ""Angelito""]

[Intro: Romeo Santos]
Sentimiento, mami
¡Aventura!

[Verso 1: Romeo Santos]
Hasta en mi sueño tus deseos intenté de complacer
Por ti la luna alcancé
Y en mi jornada un angelito me encontré
Me vio muy triste, supo que perdí la fe
En mi sueño no vi un rostro, solo lo escuchaba hablar
Me daba cátedra de amor y al escuchar
Ansiosamente le empezaba a reclamar
¿Cuál es la clave para que me puedas amar?

[Pre-Coro: Romeo Santos]
Primero me dijo que es un pecado pensar solo en ti
Segundo que no puedo ni debo aunque quiero dar la vida por ti
Tercero que mi destino en el amor corre peligro, me advierte de ti
Y cuarto que un esclavo en el amor, le pisotean el corazón
Que aquel que ama pero no demuestra to' el cariño se prepara para un desliz

[Coro: Judy Santos]
El amor es lo más raro que ha podido existir
Quien de ti se enamoró, lo más probable ni le pones atención
Y otra persona le das una flor, una poesía, entregas tu corazón
Y si ocurre una desilusión, pierdes la esencia y la fe en el amor

[Post-Coro: Romeo Santos]
Esta noche quiero volver a soñar
A ver si aprendo algo más
Y que me salga ese angelito tan divino
Que me ha venido aconsejar

[Puente: Romeo Santos]
It's only a dream, Romeo...
Wake up
We're nasty

[Pre-Coro: Romeo Santos]
Primero me dijo que es un pecado pensar solo en ti
Segundo que no puedo ni debo aunque quiero dar la vida por ti

274,Something's Gotta Give,"[Verse 1]
Loving you, I thought I couldn't get no higher
Your November rain could set the night on fire, night on fire
But we could only burn so long
Counterfeit emotions only run skin deep
Know you're lying when you're lying next to me, next to me
How did we get so far gone?

[Pre-Chorus]
I should know by now
You should know by now
We should know by now

[Chorus]
Something's gotta give, something's gotta break
But all I do is give, and all you do is take
Something's gotta change, but I know that it won't
No reason to stay is a good reason to go
Is a good reason to go, ooh

[Verse 2]
I have never heard a silence quite so loud
I walk in the room and you don't make a sound, make a sound
You're good at making me feel small
If it doesn't hurt me, why do I still cry?
If it didn't kill me, then I'm half alive, half alive
How did we get so far gone?

[Pre-Chorus]
I should know by now
You should know by now
We should know by now

[Chorus]
Something's gotta give, something's gotta break
But all I do is give, and all you do is take
Something's gotta change, but I know that it won't
No reason to stay is a good reason to go
Is a good reason to go

[Bridge]
I should know by now, you should know by now
I think I'm breaking right now, ooh
I should know by now, you should know by now
I think I'm breaking right now

I was reaching for some other love
And I'm sorry for making things so tough
You were the only one that I could touch
The only one, the only one close enough

[Pre-Chorus]
When the tears rolled down my face
He turned and walked away
And you held me, oh, you helped me through
As tears rolled down my face
He turned and walked away
When he acted in bad faith

[Chorus]
You told me not to hold hands with the devil
You warned me that I'd lose my faith
I never thought I'd leave my heaven
But now I know you're my saving grace
And all we've been through is giving us truth
And now I can never be without you
You told me not to hold hands with the devil
'Cause the devil does no good

[Verse 2]
I was reaching for another love
But you were the only one that I could trust
I shouldn't held my breath and bit my tongue
I never meant to be so rough

'Cause when the tears rolled down my face
He turned and walked away
And you held me, oh, you helped me through
As tears rolled down my face
He turned and walked away
When he acted in bad faith

You told me not to hold hands with the devil
You warned me that I'd lose my faith
I never thought I'd leave my heaven
But now I know you're my saving grace
And all we've been through is giving us truth
And now I can never be without you
You told me not to hold hands with the devil
'Cause the devil does no good

'Cause the devil does no good
When the tears rolled down my face
He turned and walked away
When he acted in bad faith

You told me not to hold hands with the devil
You warned me that I'd lose my faith
I never thought I'd leave my heaven
But now I know you're my saving grace

[Intro]
Ugh! (Woo!)
What up, y'all? Yeah
(Soundtrakk, what's poppin', baby?)
Woo! (Ugh)
If y'all ain't know
I go by the name of Lupe Fiasco
(Kick, push, coast)
Representing that First and Fifteenth, yeah, uh
And this one right here
I dedicate this one right here (Uproxx...)
To all my homies out there grinding
You know what I'm saying? Legally and illegally, haha
You know what I'm talking about? (Woo!)
So, check it out, uh

[Verse 1]
First got it when he was six, didn't know any tricks
Matter of fact, first time he got on it, he slipped
Landed on his hip and busted his lip
For a week he had to talk with a lisp, like thisss... (Ugh)
Now we can end the story right here
But shorty didn't quit, it was something in the air (Ugh)
Yeah, he said it was something so appealing
He couldn't fight the feeling, something about it
He knew he couldn't doubt it, couldn't understand it
Branded, since the first kickflip he landed, ugh (Woo)
Labeled a misfit, a bandit
Ka-kunk, ka-kunk, ka-kunk; his neighbors couldn't stand it
So, he was banished to the park
Started in the morning, wouldn't stop 'til after dark, yeah
When they said ""It's getting late in here
So I'm sorry, young man, there's no skating here""

[Hook]
And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be

[Bridge]
So let's kick... (Ugh)
And push (Y-yeah, y-yeah-yeah)
And coast
Uh, uh, uh (Y-yeah, y-yeah-yeah)

[Verse 2]
My man got a little older, became a better roller
Yeah, no helmet, hell bent on killing himself
Is what his mama said, but he was feeling himself
Got a little more swagger in his style
Met his girlfriend, she was clapping in the crowd
Love is what-what was happening to him now, ugh!
He said ""I would marry you
But I'm engaged to these aerials and varials
And I don't think this board is strong enough to carry two""
She said ""Bow!
I weigh a hundred and twenty pounds"" (Woo!)
""Now, let me make one thing clear
I don't need to ride yours, I got mine right here""
So she took him to a spot he didn't know about
Some odd-end apartment parking lot
She said ""I don't normally take dates in here""
Security came and said ""I'm sorry, there's no skating here""

[Hook]
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
And away they roll
Just lovers intertwined with no place to go
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be

[Bridge]
So let's kick (Ugh, ugh)
And push, yeah, yeah (Woo, woo)
And coast... (Yeah, ugh!)
(Haha, swanky)
Yeah, yeah!

[Verse 3]
Before he knew, he had a crew that wasn't no punk
In they Spitfire shirts and SB dunks
They would push 'til they couldn't skate no more
Office building lobbies wasn't safe no more
And it wasn't like they wasn't getting chased no more
Just the freedom was better than breathing, they said (They said...)
An escape route they used to escape out
When things got crazy, they needed to break out
They'd head... to any place with stairs
Any good grinds, the world was theirs, ugh!
And their four wheels would take them there
Until the cops came and said, ""There's no skating here""

[Hook]
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
And away they rolled
Just rebels without a cause with no place to go
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
So come roll with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be

So let's kick (Ugh, ugh)

Alright, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm wandering the streets in a world underneath it all
Nothing seems to be
Nothing tastes as sweet as what I can't have
Like you and the way that you're twisting your hair 'round your finger
Tonight I'm not afraid to tell you
What I feel about you

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
And cannon ball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will

[Verse 2]
Forgive me if I st-stutter from all of the clutter in my head
Cause I could fall asleep in those eyes
Like a water-bed
Do I seem familiar? I've crossed you in hallways a thousand times
No more camouflage, I wanna be exposed
And not be afraid to fall

[Chorus 2]
Oh, I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
And cannon ball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have

If I could dim the lights in the mall and create a moon

Divorce is not an option and prenuptial is void

Bored, kind of like a knight with the sword
Without dragon to battle so I'm running from a shadow

They only like my armor, and that I'm a performer
They read one magazine and wanna think they gettin warmer
They only getting colder hell, maybe I should throw

Even biters will tournament, to see who can be me
Better than me, it's a permanent, smile on my face
Because you said you don't like my style
But that's OK but just make sure you don't touch that dial
And we'll be cool, touch it and you's a fool
Look, I'll get you hooked, y'all crooks might even move
To Atlanta, Georgia, get a wife and daughter
Start a new life, and all that wrong you do you'll make it right

Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

[Verse 1]
I'm from the land of the gang bang
Since I was little, ain't a goddamn thang changed
It’s the same old saying
Bush run shit like Saddam Hussein
I cock and aim, clinically insane
To deal with this bullshit day-to-day
If I sell some yay or smoke some hay
You bitches wanna throw me up in Pelican's Bay
Call me an animal up in the system
But who's the animal that built this prison?
Who's the animal that invented lower-livin'?
The projects, thank God for Russell Simmons
Thank God for Sugarhill
I'm putting a different kind of steel up to my grill
Y'all know what it is, scared for your own kids
How these ghetto niggas taken over showbiz

They give us guns and drugs

It's boys in the hood, it's toys in the hood
Y'all wanna know why there's noise in the hood
‘Cause there's drugs in the hood, thugs in the hood
Nigga killed a Crip and a Blood in the hood
‘Cause when niggas get tribal
It's all about survival, nobody liable
I got caught by Five-O
Grandmama came to court with her Bible
But when the judge hit the gavel
Now I'm too far from my family to travel
I just came unraveled
Socked the D.A. before I got gaffled
Owned by C.A, State Property
Just like the year fifteen fifty three
Looking for me, a one-way ticket out
Don't understand, what's so hard to figure out?

Damn, I can't take the pressure
Pulled the 4-4 up out the dresser
Grabbed the weight up out the closet
Po-po coming, but I'm scared to toss it
Y'all know what happened last time I lost it
Can't tell you niggas what the fuckin' boss did
D game got a nigga exhausted
Gotta go for the plea bargain they offered
Twenty years for what?
Breaking these laws that's so corrupt
Taking these halls and fillin' them up
Some powder keg shit that's about to erupt
Aye, y'all, I'm about to be stuck
Until the year two thousand, what the fuck?
In the hood, don't press your luck
‘Cause these motherfuckers will set you up, word up

Where would I be? what would I do
Without you looking out for me?
Probably be, probably be in these streets

Ten points, like he about to blow that
He probably did, you swallow his kids?
In and out of jail, he a snail, he wasn't wilding on bids
In the summertime, I broke his jaw, had to do it to him
Quick, old fashion, in the back of the mall
Me and him had 'mos forever, like I'm supposed to put him on
When he came home and told on Trevor
Had to bang on homey, ear blocks, out in spots
Throwing them shots, like 'nigga, you know me'
Stop fronting for them niggas outside like you really ride

That's why I put your ass under my arm
Fuckin' with him can bring bodily harm
And where you gonna hide in the streets when the body is gone
If it's one thing I learned that, never trust a female
On no scale, you just confirmed that
Bounce to your momma house, pack your shit

She said her name Shayeeda
I could tell her mama feed her (Yeah!)
When they tight and thick them jeans don't fit
I'm L, nice to meet ya (Uh-oh!)
I could feel my body yearning

Didn't want to go out on the floor

How we lust for one another (Yeah)

Yet we're wilding like we're lovers

Her hips, tossed, back, and forth

Stop it don't make me hurt you

306,Wherever You Are,"[Verse 1: Luke]
For a while we pretended
That we never had to end it
But we knew we'd have to say goodbye
You were crying at the airport
When they finally closed the plane door
I could barely hold it all inside

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
Torn in two and I know shouldn't tell you
But I just can't stop thinking of

[Chorus: All & Luke]
You, wherever you are
You, wherever you are
Every night I almost call you
Just to say it always will be you
Wherever you are

[Verse 2: Calum]
I could fly a thousand oceans
But there's nothing that compares to what we had
And so I'll walk alone
I wish I didn't have to be gone
Maybe you've already moved on
But the truth is I don't want to know

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
Torn in two and I know shouldn't tell you
But I just can't stop thinking of

[Chorus: All & Luke]
You, wherever you are
You, wherever you are
Every night I almost call you
Just to say it always will be you
Wherever you are

[Bridge: Luke]
You can say we'll be together some day
Nothing lasts forever
Nothing stays the same
So why can't I stop feeling this way?

308,Soundtrack To Your Life,"If you can hear me
And know that I'm right here
I heard your heartbeat
It took away the fear
'Cause my life is sliding
I tried to ride the wave
It came down crashing, it's time to start again
Backwards to go forward
Left at every corner
Been there and back again
And when the music ends

Your life is a flashback
A question, a photograph
A statement, a story, a struggle
A chance to laugh
'Cause if you don't laugh you cry
A last crescendo when you die
So hit the rewind and listen
It's the playback
The soundtrack to your life

First step, your last breath
Eveythings been planned
There's questions and answers
You'll never understand
I hold on but let go
Give you room to breathe
Remember the best things
Were never mine to keep
Starting at the ending
You won't break while your bending
Been there and back again
And when the music ends

Your life is a flashback
A question, a photograph
A statement, a story, a struggle
A chance to laugh
'Cause if you don't laugh you cry
A last crescendo when you die
So hit the rewind and listen
It's the playback
The soundtrack to your life

Soundtrack to your life
That it goes by like a bullet
And my name
It may be different than yours
But we are the same
Beat up broken back for more
I'll be dragging my own ass off the floor
I've throw myself right in it
What's the point if you don't live it

If you can hear me
And know that im right here
I heard your heartbeat
It took away the fear

Your life is a flashback
A question, a photograph
A statement, a story, a struggle
A chance to laugh
'Cause if you don't laugh you cry
A last crescendo when you die

It's the playback

309,Upside Down,"[Verse 1]
24, staring in your face like it’s the front of the door
I know right now is hard cause this all feels like a chore
I don’t want this as a job help me find something more
I cannot tell the ceiling from the floor
Is this really what you want?
Swear I never meant to haunt
All I ever do is taunt
Couldn’t handle how you flaunt
Now it’s quiet on the front
Has been for so many months
Now it’s wild to remember I was in love with you once

[Chorus]
It's all love now, upside down
It's all love now, upside down

[Verse 2]
Let me go, cut the leash before
I lose us in a bad undertow
Have to channel how you made me feel
To play every show
Make my snide suggestions about
The things I don’t know
I will not catch a feeling I’ll just float
All that time across the pond
All this resin in my lungs
No more room to shoulder on
Am I even having fun?
Colin’s sleeping with his gun
Scott is looking for the one
Mertz is going by Ryan now that we’ve all had our run

Laughin' loud so all the little people stare
Lookin' for a daddy to pay for the champagne (Droppin' names)

Ooh. Jesus Christ had dreads, so shake em
I ain't got none, but I'm planning on growing some
Imagine all the Hebrews going dumb
Dancing on top of chariots and turning tight ones
Ooh, tell me when to go (dumb)
Talking on my Ghettro on the way to the store
My second or third trip
Some Henny, some Swishers and some Listerine strips
Dr. Greenthumb lips, just to ease my thoughts
Not just the cops, but the homies you got to watch
The moon is full, look at the dark clouds
Sitting in my scraper, watching Oakland Gone Wild, ta-dow

From the soil where them rappers be getting their lingo from

312,The Seashores Of Old Mexico,"[Verse 1]
I left, out of Tucson, with no destination in mind
I was running from trouble and the jail-term the Judge had in mind
And the border meant freedom, a new life, romance
And that's why I thought I should go
And start my life over on the seashores of old Mexico

[Verse 2]
My first night in Juarez, lost all the money I had
One bad senorita made use of one innocent lad
But I must keep on running; it's too late to turn back
I'm wanted in Tucson, I'm told
Yeah, and things'll blow over on the seashores of old Mexico

[Verse 3]
Two Mexican farmers en route to a town I can't say
Let me ride on the back of a flatbed half-loaded with hay
Down through Durango, Colima, Almiera
Then in the Manzanillos
Where I slept on the seashores of old Mexico

[Verse 4]
After one long siesta, I came wide awake in the night
I was startled by someone who shadowed the pale moonlight
My new-found companion, one young senorita
Who offered a broken hello
To the gringo she found on the seashores of old Mexico

[Verse 5]
She spoke of Sonora and swore that she'd never return
For her Mexican husband, she really had no great concern
Cause she loved the gringo, my red hair and lingo
That's all I needed to know
Yeah, I found what I needed on the seashores of old Mexico

Yeah, she loved the gringo, my red hair and lingo

And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you’re lucky, but you’re so confused
'Cause you don’t feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you’ll make it out alive

[Chorus 1]
And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now

[Pre-Chorus 3]
‘Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right

[Chorus 2]
Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one

Konvict {*echoes*} (Dat dada dat da)
(Dat dada dat da, dat dada dat da)
(Dat dada dat da, dada ooh)
Konvict Music, uh-huh

[Verse 1: Akon]
See I can kinda recall little ways back
Small tryin' to ball; always been black
And my hair I tried it all - I even went flat
Had a gumdee curly top and all that crap, now
Tryin' to be appreciated
Nappy headed brothers never had no ladies
Then I hit by the barber shop real quick
Had em give me little twist and it drove them crazy
And then I couldn't get no job
Cause corporate wouldn't hire no dreadlocks
Then I thought about my dogs on the block
Kinda understand why they chose a steal and rob
Was it the hair that got me this far? (uh-huh)
All these girls these cribs these cars (uh-huh)
I Hate to say it but it seem so flawed
Cause success didn't come 'til I cut it all off (uh-huh)

[Verse 2: India Arie]
Little girl with the press and curl
Age eight I got a Jheri curl
Thirteen then I got a relaxer
I was a source of so much laughter
Fifteen when it all broke off
Eighteen and then I went all natural
February two thousand and two I
Went on and did what I had to do
Cause it was time to change my life
To become the women that I am inside
Ninety-seven dreadlocks all gone
Looked in the mirror for the first time and saw that
Hey...

[Chorus: India.Arie]
I am not my hair, I am not this skin
I am not your ex-pec-tations no no
I am not my hair, I am not this skin
I am the soul that lives within

[Verse 3: India Arie]
Good hair means curls and waves
Bad hair means you look like a slave
At the turn of the century
It's time for us to redefine who we be;
You can shave it off like a South African beauty
Or get in on lock Like Bob Marley;
You can rock it straight like Oprah Winfrey -
If it's not what's on your head
It's what's underneath and say
Hey....

[Chorus]
I am not my hair, I am not this skin
I am not your expectations no
I am not my hair, I am not this skin
I am a soul that lives within

[Verse 4: Akon]
Who cares if you don't like that
With nothin' to lose post it with a wave cap
And the cops tryin' to harass cause I got waves
Ain't seen nothin' like that, not in my days (noo...)
Man, you gotta change all these feeling's
Steady judging one another by their appearance
Yes, India I feel ya girl
Now go ahead talk the rest of the world

[Bridge: India Arie]
(Oh, oh, oh) Does the way I wear my hair make me a better person?
(Whoa, whoa, whoa) Does the way I wear my hair make me a better friend? (Nooo...)
(Whoa, whoa, whoa) Does the way I wear my hair determine my integrity?
(Whoa, whoa, whoa) I am expressing my creativity...

[Verse 5: India Arie]
Breast cancer and chemotherapy
Took away her crown and glory
She promised God if she was to survive
She would enjoy everyday of her life ooh...
On national television
Her diamond eyes are sparkling
Bald headed like a full moon shining
Singing out to the whole wide world like
Hey...

[Chorus]
I am not my hair, I am not this skin
I am not your expectations no
I am not my hair, I am not this skin
I am a soul that lives within

Yeah the big boss man, he likes to crack that whip

Gotta fix that calendar I have
That's marked July 15th

Of what used to be
That's the reason

If I could call out a price, let's say I call out a lot
I got like platinum and white rose, traditional gold
I'm changing grills everyday, like Jay change clothes
I might be grilled out nicely (oh) In my white tee (oh)
Or on South Beach (oh) in my wife beat
VVS studded, you can tell when they cut it
You see my grandmama hate it, but my lil mama love it
Cause when I...
Open up ya mouth, ya grill gleaming (say what)
Eyes stay low from the chiefing (chiefing)
I got a grill they call penny candy, you know what that means
It look like Now and Laters, gum drops, jelly beans
I wouldn't leave it for nothing only a crazy man would
So if you catch me in your city, somewhere out in your hood
Just say...

Smiling showing off my diamonds sipping on some potent oil
I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
20 carats 30 stacks let 'em know I'm so for real
My motivation is from 30 pointers, VVS
The frontage in my mouth piece simply symbolize success
I got the wrist wear and neck wear that's captivating
But it's what smile that's got these onlookers spectating
My mouth piece simply certified a total package
Open up my mouth and you see more carrots than a salad
My teeth are mind blowing giving everybody chills
Call me George Foreman cause I'm selling everybody grills

Mama, bless me to my bones
You have started the fire
Ooh, I'm weak now in my soul

With your poison sting
This is deep and true
I'd do anything

You bleed

I see everything in you tonight
I breathe

Wanna turn you inside out

326,Beautiful Love,"[Verse 1]
I’m out for whatever you want to call it, cash or paper
My only purpose to kill, perfect assassinator
I’m on the path of Islam, you on the path of Vader
My nickname Buck 50 cousin pass the razor
The 750i turn you from a fan to hater
Feeling myself like I’m a chronic masturbator
I ain’t the type of motherfucker you should ask a favour
I’m the type of motherfucker that’ll blast my neighbour
I look at anybody as weak that has a savior
The Israeli Galil will turn your ass to vapor
I got an Ingram MAC-11 and it has a laser
I got a thing for MAC-11s, not a passive nature
Everything I write is war on the pad and paper
I don’t listen to rap no more, my passion’s Slayer
My heart is cold as the temperature of a massive glacier
I put a giant hole inside you like a massive crater

[Verse 2]
Everywhere I go the bohl Paz is strapped
I be loading it up, I be cocking it back
I ain’t in my right mind, I ain’t stopping at that
I will hit his lifeline in the back of his cap
See I’m faster than a motherfucker grabbing his gat
Beating me is just illogical imagining that
I’m a G you is just a pacifist rat
I make bodies disappear like a magical act
Yeah, I’m just giving the fans another anthem
This is just another example of my expansion
I make your top drop like the new Phantom
I like to pop shots with my new cannon
The left hook wild vicious, I’m a champion
You ain’t wilding out, cousin, that’s a tantrum
Wild assault rifles, thirty fucking handguns
I’m holding all of you motherfuckers for ransom",Vinnie Paz,2006,"[94, 96, 66, 55, 59, 96, 69]",7

329,World Wide Suicide,"[Verse 1]
I felt the earth on Monday, it moved beneath my feet
In the form of a morning paper, laid out for me to see
Saw his face in a corner picture, I recognized the name
Could not stop staring at the face I'd never see again
It's a shame to awake in a world of pain
What does it mean when a war has taken over
It's the same everyday in a hell man made
What can be saved, and who will be left to hold her?

[Chorus]
The whole world
World over
It's a worldwide suicide

[Verse 2]
Medals on a wooden mantle, next to a handsome face
That the president took for granted
Writing checks that others pay
And in all the madness
Thought becomes numb and naive
So much to talk about, nothing for to say
It's the same everyday and the wave won't break
Tell you to pray, while the devils on their shoulder
Laying claim to the take that our soldiers save
Does not equate, and the truth's already out there

[Chorus]
The whole world
World over
It's a worldwide suicide

The whole world
World over
It's a worldwide suicide

[Verse 3]
Looking in the eyes of the fallen
You got to know there's another, another, another, another
Another way
It's a shame to awake in a world of pain
What does it mean when a war has taken over
It's the same everyday and the wave won't break
Tell you to pray, while the devils on their shoulder

[Chorus]
The whole world
World over
It's a worldwide suicide

The whole world

Because of you

Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you, I am afraid

[Verse 2]
I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with

[Chorus 1]
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust

Because of you
I am afraid

[Bridge]
I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing

Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt

Get a new drink, hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine goin'

Conversation and Hennessy

I ain't even on that, period (period)
I'm makin' millions, I'm serious (I'm makin' millions)
That money come in various (furious)
Can't count it, I get delirious (delirious)
I bought my mama a mansion (a mansion)
So I can't trip over materials (yeah, yeah)

These niggas drippin', that's period
Nah, they can't find me and I'm serious (serious)
They right behind, I'm serious (serious)
And I'm straight off the 9, now I'm serious
Who you gon' send to fuck with me?
Take stuff from me or from any of mine? Now I'm curious (I'm curious)
Better think 'fore you bust at me
If you miss, I'll clap a 50 and, man, now I'm furious
Dived in that water, dived like Aquarius
Young nigga, we was breakin' the barriers (breakin' the barriers)
If you grabbin' that torch, better carry it (better carry it)
Tryna hide on that porch on some scary shit (fuck yeah)

All I smoke is loud, you got that mild like Darius (yeah)
My son ain't gotta work because he gon' inherit it, uh huh (gon' inherit it)
We yell, ""Gang-gang first,"" you don't even know your heritage (bitch)
Took the cash from verses, I give that shit to charity
Lovin' my city like Chano, I swear
Why the fuck I still gotta ride everywhere with it?
""Herb I seen you on the news, I was worried""
We was just jokin' with y'all, that's a parody
We don't talk too much, got D's everywhere (everywhere)
We still fresh, double G's everywhere (everywhere)
I put the VV's everywhere (everywhere)
I do Mike Amiri's, every pair
And they know me for shittin' on everybody
I'm the one that do shit that you hear about
I'm the one that told y'all that I move like Obama
Then how the fuck they end up with my whereabouts?
Hold on, everybody gotta clear it out
Middle of summer, hot like a sauna
We was laid back in the back of the Honda
Told young sneak up, anaconda
It ain't happen, I wasn't there, your Honor
I was somewhere eatin' Benihana's
Get valet and Lil' Benny to park it
All my life I had been in apartments
Move to balley, get a brib, I'm ballin'
My bitch always primpin', keep ballin'
Yes I'm a lil' workaholic
Hit the crib with a 50 and all 20's
I'ma just make her count all of 'em
But I get the backend all blues
Nah don't fuck around, bruh, do all of it
Know it's goin' right to lil' dude
Already got a closet, all shoes
Bought 10 pairs of baby G-Fazos
And my bitch got a closet with some Loubs
Cashed out on the crib, I ain't get the view
I'm like, ""Fuck it, no problem, it'll do""
Mama's crib got a pond, not a pool
We had roaches and rats, I ain't get to move
I survived through it all, it's true (yes, it's true)
Slept on couches and floors all through middle school
Now I'm cool, now I'm 'bool
Now my car go vroom, (vroom)
Niggas hatin' on me, but it's bool

Alone in this house again tonight
I got the TV on, the sound turned down and a bottle of wine
There's pictures of you and I on the walls around me
The way that it was and could have been surrounds me
I'll never get over you walking away

[Chorus]
I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that being strong meant never losing your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain
To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain
From my eyes
Tonight I wanna cry

[Verse 2]
Would it help if I turned a sad song on
""All By Myself"" would sure hit me hard now that you're gone
Or maybe unfold some old yellow lost love letters
It's going to hurt bad before it gets better
But I'll never get over you by hiding this way

[Chorus]
I've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show
And I thought that being strong meant never losing your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough to let go of my pain

I've been thinking about this all day long
Never felt a feeling quite this strong
I can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man

There's no hurry
Don't you worry
We can take our time

339,Believe,"[Verse 1]
And I started from the bottom
Like a snowman—ground-up
Like round chuck, and still put hands on you
Stayin' wound up is how I spend time (Get it?)
Sucker free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes
I just got that air about me like wind chimes (Yeah)
'Nother day in the life (Uh)
Used to have to scrape to get by (Yeah)
Now my community's gated and I
Made it and my neighbors say hi (Say hi)
I'm givin' 'em pounds, I'm upscale now
Guess it means I'm way in the sky (Way in the sky)
But I still remember the days of
Minimum wage for general labor
Welfare recipient since a minor
Look how government assistance has made ya!
Adversity, if at first you don't succeed
Put your temper to more use
'Cause bein' broke's a poor excuse
That should only give you more fuel
Show 'em why you're you
So close, God, it's like I almost got it
But close only counts in time bombs and horseshoes
So I Unabomb shit—tick, tick, tick—no remorse, pew!
Screw it, I'm lit, and that attitude I blew up on quick
That's why they call me firecracker
I grew up on WIC—wick, wick, wick—with a short fuse
I got some important news to report to
Anyone who thought I was done: nah bitch, not quite
Spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours?

[Chorus]
Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

[Verse 2]
Man, I know sometimes
These thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice
To me they're just ink blots
I just fling 'em like slingshots and so precise
So you might wanna think it over twice (Yeah)
Or you retards can roll the dice
But beef will at least cost you your career
'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced
But this middle finger's free as a bird
Nuke warhead at birth, hugest forehead on Earth
Too short for the verse, studied his formula, learned
How to incorporate a curse
Point it towards corporate America
Stick a fork in and turn
'Cause four-letter words are more better heard
The world force-fed a turd to me, you're getting yours
But sometimes I overdo it, but I just get so into it
I was there consolin' you when no one knew it
When your situation showed no improvement
I was that door, you walked over to it
I'm the light at the end of the tunnel
So people are always lookin' to me as they're goin' through it
When that tunnel vision is unclear
Shit becomes too much to bear
Since ""Cleanin' Out My Closet""
When I was havin' trouble with the snare
I'm that unrealistic prayer answered
And I'ma get you jacked up like you're tryna fix a flat, uh
When you struggle with despair
That double-fisted, bare-knuckles coupled with this pair
Of nuts I'm cuppin', I am your 'fuck it' switch, nothin' can compare

[Chorus]
Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

[Verse 3]
Started from the bottom like a snowman
Oh man, put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that
But my battery's low, I'ma need a boost to my pack
And I know that I always got Proof at my back
I called you ""Proof"" because I knew for a fact
My ace in the hole, homie, I'm callin' on you
'Cause I think I'm slowly startin' to lose faith in it, so
Give me that inkling and mo–
–tivation to go, Hussein with the flow
Fake fans that are two-faced didn't show
Let heartbeats loop, produce hate in my soul
Layin' vocals two days in a row
True statement, hate to go down this road
But there's only one route to cross this bridge
So I walk in this bitch with loose change
'Cause all my dues paid, but this booth's takin' its toll
But it's never too late to start a new beginnin'
That goes for you too, so what the fuck you gon' do?
Use the tools you're given!
Or you're gon' use the cards you're dealt
As an excuse for you to not do shit with 'em?
I used to play the loser/victim
'Til I saw the way Proof was driven
I found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet
And when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets
Fanny packs, hourglasses
If time was on my side, I'd still have none to waste
Man, in my younger days
That dream was so much fun to chase
It's like I'd run in place
While this shit dangled in front of my face
But how do you keep up the pace
And the hunger pangs once you've won the race?
When that dual exhaust is coolin' off
'Cause you don't got nothin' left to prove at all
'Cause you done already hit 'em with the coup de grâce
Still you feel the need to go full tilt
That Bruce Willis, that Blue Steel, that true skill
When that wheel's loose, I won't lose will

[Сэмпл: Stariola — ""Drifting""]
My mind is...

[Куплет 1]
Я не нахожу себя, это напоминает гибель
Будто тело на цепях идёт куда-то ближе к рыбам
Я прибитый на кресте и ты со мной, где бы я ни был
Моя жизнь не будет гонкой, думай, сука, что я выбыл
И мне похуй, что ты думаешь
(И потому) И потому я без оков
Это время меня режет саблезубым тесаком
Эти лавры сладко-приторны, как будто Синнабон
Внутри черепа фейерверки, просто жизнь не без забот
Меня не встречает утро, но встречает аэропорт
Просил об этом Бога с чернозёмом на зубах
Но если выбор делал я, тогда кому нужна судьба?
Изнутри на меня смотрит мой единственный судья
Я найду прикольный мир, опять воспряну, как дитя
Научу дышать свободно без задержек и без тяг
Но ты выберешь быть жертвой, что укутана в сетях

[Сэмпл: Stariola — ""Drifting""]
My mind is
Drifting now, drifting now
Mary wants to marry me
It's time to meet Mary Jane
Of course, oh, my mind is
Drifting now, drifting now
Mary wants to marry me
It's time to meet Mary Jane
Of course, oh, my mind is

[Куплет 2]
Я по-новой разряжу в себя обойму
В новой жизни точно всё будет по-моему
Но ничто ещё меня не обезболивало так
Как она и её губы в меланхолии
Я смотрю по сторонам и совсем никого не вижу
Моя жизнь напоминает ураган перед затишьем
Эти фейковые люди, что не нужны даже им же
Эти бляди, что ведутся на бабло или на имидж
Я реально ощущаю, что я в музыке один
Заваленный вещами, что на нюх, как керосин
Твою жизнь на болтовню и Инстаграмом моно-стиль
Привыкать — это не думать, привыкать — это инстинкт
Во мне тысячи причин, но мне не вылечить их чин
Сегодня голова забита только чиличин
Мне всё чаще нужен тормоз, чтоб понять, куда мы мчим
Я охладею почти тут же, что хотелось получить
Я бы зажал без остановки, сладкотелых на ручник
Но я вымолил у Бога меня с музой обручить
Со мной будут рядом те же с кубком или чё случись
От разбитых черепов и до поломанных ключиц

[Припев]
Это мой кайф
Уметь ценить нас вместо них
Жить без цены, невест и нимф
Мой крест один нести
Отец, веди, как не опередить же их, сын
Это мой кайф
Уметь ценить нас вместо них
Жить без цены, невест и нимф
Мой крест один нести
Отец, веди, как не опередить же их, сын
Это мой кайф (Это мой кайф)

346,King Without A Crown,"[Verse 1]
You're all that I have and you're all that I need
Each and every day I pray to get to know you, please
I want to be close to you, yes I'm so hungry
You're like water for my soul when it gets thirsty
Without you there's no me
You're the air that I breathe
Sometimes the world is dark and I just can't see
With these, demons surround all around to bring me down to negativity
But I believe, yes I believe, I said I believe
I'll stand on my own two feet
Won't be brought down on one knee
Fight with all of my might and get these demons to flee
HaShem's rays fire blaze burn bright and I believe
HaShem's rays fire blaze burn bright and I believe
Out of darkness comes light, twilight unto the heights
Crown Heights burnin' up all through till twilight
Said thank you to my God, now I finally got it right
And I'll fight with all of my heart, and all a' my soul, and all a' my might

[Hook]
What's this feeling?
My love will rip a hole in the ceiling
I give myself to you from the essence of my being and I
Sing to my god, songs of love and healing
I want Moshiach now, time we start revealing
What's this feeling?
My love will rip a hole in the ceiling
I give myself to you from the essence of my being and I
Sing to my god, songs of love and healing
I want Moshiach now

[Verse 2]
Strippin’ away the layers and reveal your soul
Got to give yourself up and then you become whole
You're a slave to yourself and you don't even know
You want to live the fast life but your brain moves slow
If you're trying to stay high, bound to stay low
You want God but you can't deflate your ego
If you're already there then there's nowhere to go
If your cup's already full then its bound to overflow
If you're drowning in the waters and you can't stay afloat
Ask Hashem for mercy, and he'll throw you a rope
You're looking for help from God you say he couldn't be found
Searching up to the sky and looking beneath the ground
Like a King without his Crown
You keep fallin' down
You really want to live but can't get rid of your frown
Tried to reach unto the heights and wound bound down on the ground
Given up your pride and then you heard a sound
Out of night comes day and out of day comes light
Nullified to the One like sunlight in a ray
Makin' room for his love and a fire gone blaze
Makin' room for his love and a fire gone blaze

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
See I lift up my eyes where my help come from
And I seen it circling around from the mountain
Thunder!

You keep my mind at ease and my soul at rest

Seen it circling around from the mountain

347,Always On Your Side,"[Verse 1: Sheryl Crow]
My yesterdays are all boxed up and neatly put away
But every now and then you come to mind
'Cause you were always waiting to be picked to play the game
But when your name was called, you found a place to hide
When you knew that I was always on your side

[Verse 2: Sting]
Everything was easy then, so sweet and innocent
But my demons and my angels reappeared
Leavin' only traces of the man you thought I'd be
Too afraid to hear the words I'd always feared
Leavin' you with only questions all these years

[Chorus: Sheryl Crow & Sting, Sheryl Crow]
But is there someplace far away, someplace where all is clear?
Easy to start over with the ones you hold so dear
Or are you left to wonder, all alone eternally?
This isn't how it's really meant to be
No it isn't how it's really meant to be

[Verse 3: Sheryl Crow, (Sting), Sheryl Crow & Sting]
Well they say that love is in the air (love is in the air), never is it clear
How to pull it close and make it stay
Well butterflies are free to fly, and so they fly away
And I'm left to carry on and wonder why
Even through it all, I'm always on your side

[Chorus: Sheryl Crow & Sting, Sting]
But is there someplace far away, someplace where all is clear?
Easy to start over with the ones you hold so dear
Or are you left to wonder, all alone, eternally?

Well they say that love is in the air, never is it clear

Don't ever ever break away
Where there's a will oh there's a way

349,"Jesus, Take The Wheel","[Verse 1]
She was driving last Friday on the way to Cincinnati
On a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her Mama and her Daddy with the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was running low on faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was going way too fast
Before she knew it, she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

[Chorus]
Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Jesus, take the wheel

[Verse 2]
It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said, ""I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life
I know I've got to change
So from now on tonight""

[Chorus]
Jesus, take the wheel
Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
Oh, Jesus, take the wheel

[Bridge]
Oh, I'm letting go
So give me one more chance

But most of the time I call it a night before they do
'Cause she don't tell me to
Sunday mornin', I'm in church
An' my butt an' my back an' necktie hurt, but I'm in the pew
She don't tell me to

Any other woman I know would have tried
To control me and it would be over
Plannin' on my goin' on my own way attitude
All of that stubborness melts away
When I wake with her head on my shoulder
An' I know I've got to love her
Until my life is through
'Cause she don't tell me to

Well, I got demons and I've got pride
But when I'm wrong, I apologise like she's mine to lose
'Cause she don't tell me to
Well, I got dreams in this heart of mine
But nothin' that I wouldn't lay aside if she asked me to
'Cause she don't tell me to

Oh, she's a gold digger
Way over town that digs on me

(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said: ""I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls, you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm""
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her

Eighteen years, eighteen years
She got one of your kids, got you for eighteen years
I know somebody payin' child support for one of his kids
His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money
She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Shoulda got that insured, Geico for your money
If you ain't no punk
Holla, ""We want prenup! We want prenup!"" (Yeah!)

Now, I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke, but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat, he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it to a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries
So stick by his side
I know there's dudes ballin', and yeah, that's nice
And they gonna keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl
And when you get on, he'll leave yo' ass for a white girl

I believe I can see the future
Cause I repeat the same routine
I think I used to have a purpose
Then again, that might have been a dream

I think I used to have a voice
Now I never make a sound
I just do what I've been told
I really don't want them to come around
Oh no

There is no love here and there is no pain
Every day is exactly the same

In case I lose myself again
Sometimes I think I'm happy here
Sometimes, yet I still pretend

I can't remember how this got started
But I can tell you exactly how it will end

Every day is exactly the same
Every day is exactly the same
There is no love here and there is no pain
Every day is exactly the same

I'm writing on a little piece of paper
I'm hoping someday you might find
Well I'll hide it behind something
They won't look behind
I am still inside
A little bit comes bleeding through
I wish this could've been any other way
But I just don't know, I don't know
What else I can do

[Chorus]
Every day is exactly the same
Every day is exactly the same
There is no love here and there is no pain

If we're tryin', so we're breakin' free

In a way that different than who we are
Creating space between us, 'til we're seperate hearts
But your faith, it gives me strength
Strength to believe

This is truth, this is fate
And together we see it coming
More than you, more than me
Not a want, but a need

368,Sorry,"[Written by Julia Michaels, Justin Tranter, and Justin Bieber]

[Verse 1]
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Verse 2]
I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Bridge]
I'm not just trying to get you back on me
Cause I'm missing more than just your body

369,Lo Que Me Gusta A Mi,"Cuando yo estoy pensando en ti
Amor es lo que más fuerte sale de mí
Por eso yo siempre vivo tan feliz
Pues tú eres lo que yo más quiero para mí

Cuando yo me voy para Medellín
En cada montaña yo dibujo trozos de ti
Y si yo me voy para Bogotá también allá
Esa sabana bella de ti me hace recordar
Y he recorrido el mundo entero y jamás

Te digo que he visto una cosa más bella que tu mirar
Te digo que he visto la luna de noche hablar con el mar
Pero jamás he visto una cosa más bella que tu mirar
Y es que son tus ojos tu sonrisa y tu boca
Y t u carita de coqueta a la primero lo que me gusta a mí
Y soy yo quien se pone siempre como un loco
Cuando me miras poco a poco de la manera que me gusta a mí

Ayer hacía mucho mucho pero mucho calor
Y yo sentía frío porque no tenía todo tu amor
Hoy en cambio hace frío y siento mucho calor
Porque estás tú de nuevo conmigo mi gran amor
Y es que he recorrido el mundo entero y jamás

Te digo que he visto una cosa más bella que tu mirar
Te digo que he visto la luna de noche hablar con el mar
Pero jamás he visto una cosa más bella que tu mirar

Y es que son tus ojos tu sonrisa y tu boca
Y tú carita de coqueta a la primero lo que me gusta a mí
Y soy yo quien se pone siempre como un loco
Cuando me miras poco a poco de la manera que me gusta a mí",Juanes,2006,[94],1
370,Perfect Situation,"[Verse 1]
What's the deal with my brain?
Why am I so obviously insane?
In a perfect situation
I let love down the drain
There's the pitch, slow and straight
All I have to do is swing
And I'm a hero, but I'm a zero

[Verse 2]
Hungry nights, once again
Now it's getting unbelievable
Cause I could not have it better
But I just can't get no play
From the girls, all around
As they search the night for someone to hold onto
And I just pass through

Oohh-ho, oohh-ho, oohh-ho-whoa

Oohh-ho, oohh-ho, oohh-ho-whoa

[Verse 3]
Get your hands off the girl
Can't you see that she belongs to me?
And I don't appreciate this excess company
Though, I can't satisfy all the needs she has
And so she starts to wander
Can you blame her?

Oohh-ho, oohh-ho, oohh-ho-whoa

373,Goodbye My Lover,"[Verse 1]
Did I disappoint you or let you down?
Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?
Cause I saw the end before we'd begun
Yes I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won
So I took what's mine by eternal right
Took your soul out into the night
It may be over but it won't stop there
I am here for you, if you'd only care
You touched my heart, you touched my soul
You changed my life and all my goals
And love is blind but that I knew when
My heart was blinded by yours
I've kissed your lips and held your hand
Shared your dreams and shared your bed
I know you well, I know your smell
I've been addicted to you

[Chorus]
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me

[Verse 2]
I am a dreamer and when I wake
You can't break my spirit - it's my dreams you take
And as you move on, remember me
Remember us and all we used to be
I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile
I've watched you sleeping for a while
I'd be the father of your child
I'd spend a lifetime with you
I know your fears and you know mine
We've had our doubts but now we're fine
And I love you, I swear that's true
I cannot live without you

Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one

In mine when I'm asleep
And I will bare my soul in time
When I'm kneeling at your feet

City's breaking down on a camel's back
They'll just have to go, 'cause they don't know wack
So all you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
You won't get undercounted 'cause you're damned and free
You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they come a kissin' 'cause I don't get sleep, no
*Beep*

Windmill, windmill for the land

Take it all there on your stride

Woke up intoxicated from the night before (Night before)
Got so fucking faded I slept on the floor (On the floor)
Don't know whose house this is or where I'm at
Don't know how I made it, gotta find the door
Uh, I'm making bad decisions frequently
Tuesdays I'm exactly the same person that's the weekend me
And recently my girl's friends had told her who they see me with
But it's no secret, baby, cause we both know I'm a piece of shit
Uh, you see the FOMO is forever real
Try to take it easy truth be told but I could never chill
I be out with party girls who all be off of hella pills
And after shows they all just want to come to my hotel and chill
I walk to the bathroom and she follow (And she follow)
We do it all tonight and then regret it all tomorrow (It all tomorrow)

When in New Orleans that's just how it goes
In the city where the bars don't ever close
Yeah, everything is justified inside
When you're still out drunk at five and on the ride
Yeah, uh, I'm waving at the morning joggers
I'm just leaving the bar, stumbling off a dozen lagers
Too much whiskey, too much white, think I might call it a night
The sun is up I'll take her home, tomorrow's not goin' feel alright
Nope, nope
When you realize what you did
And the guilt makes your stomach turn now you just feel so stupid
So you have a beer for breakfast and a blunt gets included
Try forget that you slept with your ex, you can't dispute it
Nope, nope
Nothing like coming down while waking up
Drinking beers while cooking bacon up
That first half hour on your feet will have you shaken up
Just wash down the stress with two Dos Equis then you're straightened up

Yeah, we would wake up early in the morning (All I need, all I need, all I need is a chance to make it right)
And just get in the car and just ride on out (Just one chance)
Remember that? (All I need, all I need, is just one wish)
Use to watch the sunrise
(One wish, one wish)

Use to watch the sunset (All I need, all I need, all I need is a chance to make it right)
We was everything to each other, you know? (Just one chance)
(All I need, all I need, is just one wish)
Damn, I miss those days
(One wish, one wish, one wish)

(All I need, all I need, all I need is a chance to make it right)
If I could, if I could just hold you in my arms, you know what I mean? (All I need, all I need, is just one wish, one wish)
It just feels so good
(One wish)
One little, itty, bitty wish
If I could just have one wish

[Intro]
Damn baby..
Just don't understand where we went wrong
I gave you my heart
I gave you my soul
I gave you...

[Verse 1]
As a matter of fact I was the one who said I love you first
It was about eight years ago, don't act like you don't know
We were sittin' at home in your mama's livin' room
Cause, we couldn't be alone
See your mama knew I was something else, she knew how I felt
Back then we were in school and that's your favorite excuse
Growin' up I was a fool and I can't lie I'm missing you
Listen and don't trip
I think I need a bottle with a genie in it
Here's my wish list

[Hook]
First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'll make you my whole life
And you'll be my wife, make it right this time

If I had one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish
One wish, one wish, one wish

[Verse 2]
Now tell me is this the only way I can get you right back in
If so then searchin' I'll go, then I can have you for sho
Then you'll be loving me, holding me, kissing me
So girl don't tell me what I'm feeling is make believe
I swear if I lose a second chance with you
I wouldn't know what to do
I'll probably check myself into some kind of clinic
I couldn't be alone because without you I'm sick
Here's my wish list

[Hook]
First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes cause I'll be okay if I get one

If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away
Making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'll make you my whole life
And you'll be my wife, make it right this time
If I had one wish

[Bridge]
I don't even know how we ended upon this road
And, even though we are grown, Girl I just want you to know

[Hook]
If I had one wish, we would be best friends
Love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo
Promise to love you, trust me I'll trust you

391,In The Deep,"[Verse 1]
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out, and then I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

[Chorus]
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

[Verse 2]
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you
Now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared

(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Count your blessings to find what you look for (whoa-oh)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (oh-oh)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

I go on and on and on and
Don't take 'em to the crib unless they bonin
Easy, call 'em on the phone and
Platinum Chanel cologne and
I stay dressed to impress
Spark these bitches interest
Sex is all I expect
If they watch TV in the Lex, they know
They know, quarter past 4
Left the club tipsy, say no mo'
Except how I'm gettin home tomorrow
Cease will drop you off when he see his P.O
Back of my mind I hope she swallow
Man she spilled a drink on my cream Wallows
Reach the gate, hungry just ate
Riffin, she got to be to work by eight
This must mean she ain't tryna wait
Conversate, sex on the first date
I state, ""You know what you do to me""
She starts off, ""But I don't usually""
Then I whipped it out, rubber no doubt
Step out, show me what you all about
Fingers in your mouth, open up your blouse
Pull your G-string down South
I threw that back out, in the parking lot
By a Cherokee and a green drop-top
And I don't stop until I squirt
Jeans, skirt, butt-naked - it all work

Turn it up some
Alright boys, this is her favorite song
You know that right
So, if we play it good and loud
She might get up and dance again
Ohh, she put her beer down
Here she comes
Here she comes
Left, left, left right left
Whoo

[Verse 1]
Hustlers shootin' eight ball
Throwin' darts at the wall
Feelin' damn near ten feet tall
Here she comes, Lord help us all
Ol' T.W.'s girlfriend done slapped him out his chair
Poor ole boy, it ain't his fault
It's so hard not to stare

[Chorus]
At that honky tonk badonkadonk
Keepin' perfect rhythm, make ya wanna swing along
Got it goin' on like Donkey Kong
And whoo-wee, shut my mouth, slap your grandma

Lord have mercy, how'd she even get them britches on
That honky tonk badonkadonk
(Aww son)

[Verse 2]
Now Honey, you can't blame her
For what her mama gave her
It ain't right to hate her
For workin' that money-maker
Band shuts down at two
But we're hangin' out till three
We hate to see her go
But love to watch her leave

[Chorus]
With that honky tonk badonkadonk
Keepin' perfect rhythm
Make ya wanna swing along
Got it goin' on like Donkey Kong

[Bridge]
We don't care about the drinkin'
Barely listen to the band
Our hands, they start a shakin'
When she gets the urge to dance
Drivin' everybody crazy
You think you fell in love
Boys, you better keep your distance
You can look but you can't touch

[Chorus]
That honkey tonk badonkadonk
Keepin' perfect rhythm
Make ya wanna swing along

400,When I'm Gone,"[Intro]
Yeah, it's my life
In my own words, I guess

[Verse 1]
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart and you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
""Daddy, look what I made!"" ""Dad's gotta go catch a plane""
""Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?""
""I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writin' a song, this song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself""
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

[Verse 2]
I keep havin' this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screamin' she don't want me to sing
""You're makin' Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?""
""Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more"" ""Daddy, you're lyin'!
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leavin' no more, Daddy, you're mine!""
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door, tryna block it
""Daddy, please! Daddy, don't leave! Daddy, no, stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it with ya!""
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man, I can hear 'em
They're sayin', ""You got one more chance to do right and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late!""
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and this spotlight is on and I'm singin'

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

[Verse 3]
Sixty-thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow, and thank you all for comin' out
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
""Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!""
But baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
""I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin
I get the point, fine, me and Mommy are goin'.""
But baby, wait! – ""It's too late, Dad, you made the choice
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep
Screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah, I bet you you will
You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real.""
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream, ""Die, Shady!"" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was
Supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles, and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing

401,Who I Am Hates Who I've Been,"[Verse 1]
I watched the proverbial sunrise
Coming up over the Pacific and
You might think I'm losing my mind
But I will shy away from the specifics

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause I don't want you to know where I am
'Cause then you'll see my heart
In the saddest state it's ever been
This is no place to try and live my life

[Chorus 1]
(Stop right there) That's exactly where I lost it
(See that line?) Well, I never should have crossed it
(Stop right there) Well, I never should have said
That it's the very moment that I wish that I could take back

[Chorus 2]
I'm sorry for
The person I became
I'm sorry that
It took so long for me to change
I'm ready to
Be sure I never become that way again
'Cause who I am hates who I've been
Who I am hates who I've been

[Verse 2]
I talk to absolutely no one
Couldn't keep to myself enough
And the things bottled inside have finally begun
To create so much pressure that I'll soon blow up
And I heard the reverberating footsteps
Syncing up to the beating of my heart
And I was positive that unless
I got myself together I would watch me fall apart

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I can't let that happen again
'Cause then you'll see my heart
In the saddest state it's ever been
This is no place to try and live my life

(See that line?) I never should have crossed it

407,She Let Herself Go,"[Verse 1]
He wondered how she'd take it when he said goodbye
Thought she might do some crying, lose some sleep at night
But he had no idea when he hit the road
That without him in her life, she'd let herself go

[Chorus]
Let herself go on a singles cruise
To Vegas once, then to Honolulu
Let herself go to New York City
A week at the Spa; came back knocked-out pretty
When he said he didn't love her no more
She let herself go

[Verse 2]
She poured her heart and soul into their three-bedroom ranch
Spent her days raisin' babies, ironing his pants
Came home one day from the grocery store and found his note
And without him there to stop her, she let herself go

[Chorus]
Let herself go on her first blind date
Had the time of her life with some friends at the lake
Let herself go buy a brand new car
Drove it down to the beach he always said was too far
Sand sure felt good between her toes

[Chorus]
She let herself go on a singles cruise
To Vegas once, then to Honolulu
Let herself go to New York City

408,Cowboys Are Frequently Secretly (Fond Of Each Other),"Well, there's many a strange impulse out on the plains of West Texas
There's many a young boy who feels things he can't comprehend
And a small town don't like it when somebody falls between sexes
No, a small town don't like it when a cowboy has feelings for men

And I believe to my soul that inside every man there's the feminine
And inside every lady there's a deep manly voice loud and clear
Well, a cowboy may brag about things that he's done with his women
But the ones who brag loudest are the ones that are most likely queer

Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other
Say, what do you think all them saddles and boots was about?
And there's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels for his brother
And inside every cowboy there's a lady that'd love to slip out

And there's always somebody who says what the others just whisper
And mostly that someone's the first one to get shot down dead
So when you talk to a cowboy don't treat him like he was a sister
You can't fuck with a lady that's sleepin' in each cowboy's head

Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other
What did you think all them saddles and boots was about?
And there's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels for his brother
And inside every lady there's a cowboy who wants to come out
And inside every cowboy there's a lady that'd love to slip out",Willie Nelson,2006,[52],1
409,Must Be Doin' Somethin' Right,"[Verse 1]
A woman is mystery
A man just can't understand
Sometimes all it takes to please her
Is the touch of your hand
And other times you got to take it slow
And hold her all night long
Heaven knows there's so many ways
A man can go wrong

[Chorus]
Must be doing something right
I just heard you sigh
You leaned into my kiss
And closed those deep blue need you eyes
Don't know what I did
To earn a love like this, but baby, I
Must be doing something right

[Verse 2]
Anywhere you want to go
Baby, show me the way
I'm open to suggestions
Mmm, whatever you say
Tonight's about giving you
What you want, whatever it takes
Girl, I hope I'm on the right road
And judging by the smile on your face

418,Georgia,"She is something to behold
Elegant and bold
She is electricity
Running to my soul

And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me
Will work each time
Calling me to come back to bed
Singing Georgia on my mind

Lips generous and warm
You build me up like steps
Eyes innocent and wild
Remind me what it's like

And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me will work each time
Pulling me back into the flames
And I'm burning up again
I'm burning up

And I, I never understood what was at stake
I never thought your love was worth its weight
Well now you've come and gone
I finally worked it out
I worked it out

I never should have told you
I never should have let you see inside
Don't want it troubling your mind
Won't you let it be
I never should have told you
I never should have let you see inside
Don't want it troubling your mind
Won't you let it be
I never should have told you

Don't want it troubling your mind

419,What I've Been Looking For,"[Verse 1: Ryan, Sharpay, Both]
It's hard to believe that I couldn't see
You were always there beside me
Thought I was alone, with no one to hold
But you were always right beside me
This feeling's like no other
I want you to know

[Chorus: Both]
I've never had someone that knows me like you do
The way you do
I've never had someone as good for me as you
No one like you
So lonely before I finally found what I've been looking for

[Verse 2: Ryan, Sharpay, Both]
So good to be seen, so good to be heard
Don't have to say a word
For so long I was lost, so good to be found
I'm loving having you around

I want you to know

All she doin' is actin' like she want me
She cuttin' off all my homies
Even all my other ronis
She ain't even my main lady
See I been thinkin' bout it lately

With nobody tellin' me what I'm gon' do

Now I can handle all my business
All of my fellas, can I get a witness?
But I'm feelin' kinda lonely

421,Better Days,"[Verse 1]
I just want you to know that I'm stuck in your soul
Funny how last week I thought it couldn't be so
What I see in your eyes words can't come close
No matter what your father says I just want you to know
That you're a beautiful person, and I want you to grow
The way he talks to you's just so inappro
I hope that you're strong, when he's doing you wrong
And I hope you find comfort in the words of these songs
Now sing along and while I tell you this story just listen closely
I know you like my music but look, you don't really know me
See I live outside the city where there's nothing going on
I just look around for meaning while I'm sitting on my lawn
One day I met this girl and she was beautiful too
I look closely at her eyes, a nice light shade of blue
She was still in high school, I was one year removed
We're both a little older from the things we've been through
Pretty soon I started seeing all the things he would do
She wasn't black and blue but emotionally bruised
It made me so mad I didn't know what to do
Told her no matter what, I'mma be there for you
But as things became more hectic in my life I started fadin' out
Began to lie to her, I wasn't fair to her, I hate it now
I hope that you can understand my honesty
I really fuckin' wanna knock that dude out honestly
You don't have to believe it but I think about you every day
I sing about you every way cause you're the perfect melody
I know the world ain't perfect but to me you were my everything
My little light of sunshine I'm holdin' on for better days

[Hook]
I pray for better days
I know what has to happen I'm away
I know in my life I've made mistakes
But I'm holdin' on for better days
I pray for better days
I know what has to happen I'm away
I know in my life I've made mistakes
But I'm holdin' on for better days

[Verse 2]
I wanna go back where we were sittin' at that ice cream shop
I'm lookin' at you in your eyes I'm feelin' like my heart has stopped
You laugh at me for gettin' soy peanut butter
Back then I thought (shit, nah)
I don't need no other person in my life and nothing else don't even matter to me
Maybe I'm so numb that nothin' bad can ever happen to me
Maybe I'm so evil I attract all of these tragedies
Maybe we're so graceful we create all of these masterpieces
So facetious we would laugh about it
Nobody can reach us for a half an hour sleepin' in my half-apartment we don't have to watch the news
I never felt more comfortable my face so close to you
And I'mma break it down for you
I think about you every day I sing about you every way cause you're the perfect melody
I know the world ain't perfect but to me you were my everything
My little light of sunshine I'm holdin' on for better days

[Hook]
I pray for better days
I know what has to happen I'm away
I know in my life I've made mistakes
But I'm holdin' on for better days
I pray for better days
I know what has to happen I'm away
I know in my life I've made mistakes
But I'm holdin' on for better days

[Verse 3]
What does it mean if I don't know what love feels like
My parents got divorced when I was young so I just feel like
Examples that I have to look upon are probably not great
Knowing you're in a similar position doesn't make it O.K
I'm feeling like my goal is to make these blue skies turn grey
But in the blink of an eye it could go away
So even if it's just for ten minutes I wanna drive around with you
And think about our life in the present these are our better days

[Hook]
I pray for better days
I know what has to happen I'm away
I know in my life I've made mistakes
But I'm holdin' on for better days
I pray for better days
I know what has to happen I'm away
I know in my life I've made mistakes
But I'm holdin' on for better days

422,Goodbye For Now,"[Verse 1]
I can still see the light at the end of the tunnel shine
Through the dark times, even when I lose my mind
But it feels like no one In the world is listening
And I can't ever seem to make the right decisions
I walk around in the same haze
I'm still caught in my same ways
I'm losing time in these strange days
But somehow, I always know the right things to say

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know what time it is
Or who's the one to blame for this
Do I believe what I can't see?
And how do you know which way the wind blows?
'Cause I can feel it all around
I'm lost between the sound
And just when I think I know, there she goes

[Chorus]
Goodbye for now
Goodbye for now, so long
Goodbye for now (I'm not the type to say I told you so)
Goodbye for now, so long
(I think the hardest part of holding on is lettin' go)
When will we sing
A new song
A new song

[Verse 2]
We’re still smilin' as the day goes by
And how come nobody ever knows the reasons why?
Bury you deep so far that you can't see
If you're like me, who wears a broken heart on your sleeve
Pain's is troubles that you know so well
Either time don't it can't or you just won't tell
I'm not the type to say I told you so
I think the hardest part of holding on is lettin' it go

I don't know what time it is

[Verse 3]
And you can sing until there's no song left (Song left)
And I can scream until the world goes deaf (Goes deaf)
For every other word left unsaid
You shoulda took the time to read the sign and see what it meant
(See what it meant)
In some ways, everybody feels alone
So if the burden is mine, then I can carry my own (Carry my own)
If joy really comes in the morning time
Then I'ma sit back and wait until the next sun rise

[Chorus]
Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn? (All alone)
Too many doses, and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (All alone)
No one can save me, and you know I don't want the attention

[Verse 2]
As I, adjust to my new sights
The rarely tired lights, will take me to new heights
My hand is on the trigger, I'm ready to ignite
Tomorrow might not make it, but everything's all right
Mental fiction, follow me
Show me what it's like to be set free

[Chorus]
Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn? (All alone)
Too many doses, and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (All alone)
No one can save me, and you know I don't want the attention

[Post-Chorus]
So sorry you're not here, I've
Been sane too long, my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me, but
Don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem

[Bridge]
Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
These eyes won't see the same, after I flip today

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I don't know why, we'd rather live than die
We look up towards the sky, for answers to our lives
We may get some solutions, but most just pass us by
Don't want your absolution, 'cause I can't make it right

[Hook]
I'll make a beast out of myself
Gets rid of all the pain of being a man

[Chorus]
Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn? (All alone)
Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (All alone)
No one can save me and you know I don't want the attention

[Post-Chorus]
So sorry you're not here, I've
Been sane too long my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me, but
Don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem

I'm knee-deep in the game
So when it's time to re-up, I'm knee deep in the cane
Real talk, look, I'm tellin' you, mayne
If you get jammed up, don't mention my name
Forgive me, Lord, I know I ain't livin' right
Gotta feed the block, niggas starvin', they got appetites
And this is e'ryday, it never gets old

Like animals, they lock us in cages

I ain't cheat, played the hand I was dealt
Tried to tax the grand pearl when I got it myself
No nuts, no glory

Set the city on fire, and I didn't even try
Run these streets all day, I can sleep when I die

430,What I've Been Looking For (Reprise),"[Verse 1: Troy & Gabriella]
It's hard to believe
That I couldn't see
You were always there beside me
Thought I was alone
With no one to hold

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
But you were always there beside me
This feeling's like no other
I want you to know

[Chorus:Both]
That I've never had someone that knows me like you do
The way you do
And I've never had someone as good for me as you
No one like you
So lonely before I finally found
What I've been looking for

431,When There Was Me And You,"[Chorus]
I thought you were my fairytale
My dream when I'm not sleeping
A wish upon a star that's coming true

But everybody else could tell
That I confused my feelings with the truth
When there was me and you

Oh oh

[Verse 1]
I swore I knew the melody
That I heard you singing
And when you smiled
You made me feel
Like I could sing along

But then you went
And changed the words
Now my heart is empty
I'm only left with used-to-be's
And once upon a song

[Chorus 2]
Now I know you're not a fairytale
And dreams are meant for sleeping
And wishes on a star just don't come true

'Cause now, even I can tell
That I confused my feelings with the truth
Because I liked the view
When there was me and you",Joshua Bassett,2006,[72],1
432,We Belong Together,"[Intro]
Ooh, oh oh
Sweet love, yeah

[Verse 1]
I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so
I should have held on tight, I never should have let you go
I didn't know nothing, I was stupid
I was foolish, I was lying to myself
I couldn’t have fathomed I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself
'Cause I didn’t know you, 'cause I didn’t know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The feeling that I’m feeling now that I don’t hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips ‘cause I don’t have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn’t give to have you lying by my side
Right here, ’cause baby

[Chorus]
When you left, I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
‘Cause we belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough?
Who’s gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up?
Who’s gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together

[Verse 2]
I can't sleep at night, when you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Singing to me, ""If you think you're lonely now""
Wait a minute, this is too deep (Too deep)
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial tryin' to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
""I only think of you""
And it's breaking my heart
I'm tryna keep it together, but I'm falling apart

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm feeling all out of my element
Throwing things, cryin' tryin'
To figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby

[Chorus]
When you left, I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
‘Cause we belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough?
Who’s gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up?
Who’s gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together

Baby, when you left, I lost a part of me

433,Soul Meets Body,"[Verse 1]
I want to live where soul meets body
And let the sun wrap its arms around me
And bathe my skin in water, cool and cleansing and feel
Feel what it's like to be new
'Cause in my head there's a Greyhound station
Where I send my thoughts to far off destinations
So they may have a chance of finding a place
Where they're far more suited than here

[Verse 2]
Well, I cannot guess what we'll discover
When we turn the dirt with our palms cupped like shovels
But I know our filthy hands can wash one another's
And not one speck will remain

[Chorus]
I do believe it's true
That there are roads left in both of our shoes
But if the silence takes you, then I hope it takes me too
So, brown eyes, I'll hold you near
'Cause you're the only song I want to hear
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere

[Bridge]
Where soul meets body
Where soul meets body
Where soul meets body

[Chorus]
And I do believe it's true
That there are roads left in both of our shoes
But if the silence takes you, then I hope it takes me too

[Intro]
Wake up Mr. West - Mr. West - Mr. West...
Uh, yea, uh, yea, uh, yea

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
And I heard 'em say, nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
From the Chi, like Tim it's a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise of the minimum wage?
And I know that the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allāhu Akbar and throw in some hot cars
Things we see on the screen that's not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars - I know it

[Hook: Kanye West & Adam Levine]
Uh, and I heard 'em say (Ooh), nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today (Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today)
But we'll a find a way
And nothing last forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
They say people in your life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And Gran keep praying and keep believing
In Jesus, and one day that you see him
'Til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin
Claiming money is the key, so keep on dreamin
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down
So now my little cousin smokin' them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out, I'm sick of it now

[Hook: Kanye West & Adam Levine]
Uh, and I heard 'em say (Ooh), nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today (Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today)
But we'll a find a way
And nothing last forever but be honest babe
It hurts but it may be the only way

435,I Should Have Cheated,"[Verse 1]
Baby
First of all let me say
You can't accuse me of all the things you know that you are guilty of
And I see
That it is easy for you to blame everything on me
If that's the case
I should go have my fun and do all the things you say I do
Boy I can't
Continue to take this from you

[Hook]
I might as well have cheated on you
As much as you accused me of cheating
I might as well have lied to you
As much as you accused me of lying
I might as well have gone to the club
As much as you accused me of clubbin'
I might as well have threw away my love
As much as you accused me
I should have cheated

[Verse 2]
You say I was out
With somebody else when my girl told me she saw you with some girl
But I didn't
Accuse you of something that I didn't see myself
Realize
That I would never do anything to disrespect you
Trust me
You gotta stop accusing me

[Hook]
I might as well have cheated on you
As much as you accused me of cheating
I might as well have lied to you
As much as you accused me of lying

I might as well have threw away my love
As much as you accused me

[Bridge]
Don't you know I wish I knew that you would treat me this way
If you don't promise me that you've changed your ways, I'm leaving today
And I ain't coming back
And you made it like that
Was unfair to me
All this jealousy
I'm your everything
What will you do without me?
Why you trippin'?

[Hook]
I might as well have cheated on you
As much as you accused me of cheating
I might as well have lied to you
As much as you accused me of lying
I might as well have gone to the club
As much as you accused me of clubbin'
I might as well have threw away my love
I should have gave it all away
As much as you accused me
I should have cheated

[Verse 3]
I should have lied, I should have cheated
Maybe I should have went out to the club
Or maybe I, I should have done it
I should have given away all my love
Or maybe I, I should have played you
'Cause you don't appreciate me, no
And I tried to stay down with you
But your making it hard on me

[Hook]
I might as well have cheated on you
As much as you accused me of cheating
I might as well have lied to you
As much as you accused me of lying
I might as well have gone to the club
'Cause I love you
As much as you accused me of clubbin'
I might as well have threw away my love
As much as you accused me
I should have cheated
As much as you accused me of cheating
I should have cheated
As much as you accused me of lying
As much as you accused me of clubing
I love you
As much as you accused me of cheating

Seems like you'd know by now, when and how I get down, dah
And with all that I've been through, dah, I'm still around

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you ever make no mistake
Baby, I've got what it takes
And there's no way you'll ever get to me

A lime to a lemon, my D.C. women

Watch they entourage turn yours to just mirages
Disappearing acts, strictly 9's and MAC's
Killers be serial, Copperfield material
My dreams is vivid, work hard to live it
Any place I visit, I got land there
How can players stand there and say I sound like them? Hello
Push wigs back and push six Coupes that's yellow
Plus clips that expand from hand to elbow
Spray up your Day's Inn, any 'tel you in
Crack braggin', sick of braggin' how my mink be draggin'
Desert ease street sweeper inside the Beamer wagon
I rely on Bed-Stuy to shut it down if I die
Put that on my diamond bezel, you're messin' with the devil

You can't believe it, dah, you can't conceive it (You, you, you, you, you)
And you can't touch me, dah, 'cause I'm untouchable (And I know)
And I know you hate it (You hate it), dah, and you can't take it (Hoo)
You'll never break me (I'm unbreakable), dah, 'cause I'm unbreakable
You can't believe it (Hoo-hoo-hoo), dah, you can't conceive it

443,Have A Nice Day,"[Chorus: RoZe]
When I woke up this morning and the haters were up on me
I just told 'em stay up outta my way
Because I got a real bad temper, it's the middle of September
I don't think you wanna catch my case
Man, if you do so much as touch me, then it's bound to get ugly
Where police gon' end up all in my face
So, to eliminate the problem, I pop a bottle and yell out ""Sayonara"" and ""Have a nice day""

[Verse 1: Abstract]
How could I know what it's like?
(How could I know what it's like?)
How could I know other life?
Know a lotta artists who don't like to bring it to light
And I'm included in that, I ain't sayin' it's right
But it's been pushed out the news
Don't look like change will happen soon
Donald Trump is all that they talk about, I'm tired of it too
They only talkin' 'bout racism when a city's burning up
When cops are gettin' shot, and when the shooters gettin' caught
Peaceful protest rarely get a mention, y'all demented
This could be prevented
Y'all sensationalize the violence just to get a check in
What's the message?
Only gettin' heard when you draw the weapon
You wonder why these people gettin' hurt
You ain't learned your lesson
Interview yourselves, goddamn it, that might answer questions
Look at how you rep it, what's projected, fuck you Fox News!
Y'all won't ever get it, so I gotta step in
White man from the 307, tellin' y'all I'm fed up with it!

[Chorus: RoZe]
When I woke up this morning and the haters were up on me
I just told 'em stay up outta my way

Where police gon' end up all in my face
So, to eliminate the problem, I pop a bottle and yell out ""Sayonara"" and ""Have a nice day""

[Verse 2: Abstract]
Word to RoZe, I'll never relate to that
Might get pulled over, they check my ID and hit the gas
All these divisions, race, religion, economic class
How are we free till realities can overlap?
I've known what it's like to live 'round dollars on dollars
And I know what's it like to see that money get smaller
And I know what it's like to live with and without God
But I'll never know life at systematical odds
Fucked how the system has played with all of our minds
Wish that we could see each other through a child's eyes
No prejudice instilled, manipulation of the wheel
One world, under one sun
Over one race that is human
We fight amongst ourselves, like, what the hell are we doing?
Shit is so outlandish while we fuckin' up the planet
Fightin' over someone's color while our planet's in the red
A miracle in a sunbeam yeah, y'all know what I've said

[Chorus: RoZe]

Think about all the times that we danced
In the light to it all night long, oh
Then miss me baby

Sunny days seem to hurt the most
I wear the pain like a heavy coat
I feel you everywhere I go
I see your smile, I see your face
I hear you laughing in the rain
I still can't believe you're gone

[Chorus]
It ain't fair: you died too young
Like the story that had just begun
But death tore the pages all away
God knows how I miss you
All the hell that I've been through
Just knowing no-one could take your place
An' sometimes I wonder
Who'd you be today?

[Verse 2]
Would you see the world? Would you chase your dreams?
Settle down with a family
I wonder what would you name your babies?
Some days the sky's so blue
I feel like I can talk to you
An' I know it might sound crazy

[Chorus]
It ain't fair: you died too young
Like the story that had just begun
But death tore the pages all away
God knows how I miss you
All the hell that I've been through
Just knowing no-one could take your place
An' sometimes I wonder
Who'd you be today?

447,Good Ride Cowboy,"[Verse 1]
From the hills to Kaycee, Wyoming
Where life's wooly and wild
Came an Air Force brat
In a cowboy hat
And that Copenhagen smile
And from bucking broncs
To honky tonks
He always sang a cowboy's song
We were much too young
Having too much fun
As we all sang along

[Chorus]
(And we sang) Life's a highway
There's only one way
You're gonna get through it
When she starts to twist
Be more like Chris
Pull your hat down tight
And just LeDoux it
When that whistle blows
And that crowd explodes
And them pickup men are at your side
They tell you good ride cowboy, good ride

[Verse 2]
From gold buckles to gold records
Well, once again he was spinning 'round
Took the whole world on
And he turned us on
To that Western Underground
And from ""Bareback Jack""
To ""This Cowboy's Hat""
The songs were stronger than his pain
He would not slow down
From town to town
Like children running through the rain

[Chorus]
(And we sang) Life's a highway
There's only one way
You're gonna get through it
When she starts to twist
Be more like Chris
Pull your hat down tight
And just LeDoux it

And that crowd explodes
And them pickup men are at your side
They tell you good ride cowboy, good ride

There are just too many
Times that people
Have tried to look inside of me
Wondering what I think of you
And I protect you out of courtesy
Too many times that I’ve
Held on when I needed to push away
Afraid to say what was on my mind
Afraid to say what I need to say
Too many things that you’ve said about me when I’m not around
You think having the upper hand
Means you gotta keep puttin' me down
But I’ve had too many stand-offs with you
It’s about as much as I can stand
So I'm waiting until the upper hand is mine

So many people like me
Put so much trust in all your lies
So concerned with what you think
To just say what we feel inside
So many people like me
Walk on eggshells all day long
All I know is that all I want
Is to feel like I’m not stepped on
There are so many things you say
That make me feel you crossed the line
What goes up will surely fall
And I’m counting down the time
'Cause I’ve had so many stand-offs with you
It’s about as much as I can stand
So I’m waiting until the upper hand is mine

I know I’ll never trust a single thing you say
You knew your lies would divide us, but you lied anyway
And all the lies have got you floating up above us all
But what goes up has got to fall

One minute, you’re on top
(The next you’re not
Watch it drop)

Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the jewelry store lookin' at shit you can't buy
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the dealership tryin' to get a test drive
Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by

Summertime, white Porsche Carrera is milky
I'm on the grind, let my paper stack but I'm filthy
It's funny how niggas get to screw-facin' at me
Anyhow they ain't got the heart to get at me
I'll get down, Southside's the hood that I come from
So I don't cruise through nobody hood without my gun
They know the kid ain't gon' fall for all that bullshit
Try and stick me, I'ma let off a full clip
It ain't my fault you done fucked up your re-up
At the dice game, who told you put a G up?
Everybody mad when they paper don't stack right
But when I come around y'all niggas better act right
When we got the tops down, you can hear the systems thump
Nigga, when we rollin', rollin', rollin'
Shut your block down, quick to put a hole in a chump
Nigga, when we rollin', rollin', rollin'

Niggas love me in L.A. as soon as I pop in
They come to scoop me up at LAX and I hop in
Now when it comes to bad bitches you know I got them
Some from Long Beach, some from Watts and from Compton
You know a nigga wanna see how Cali girls freak off
After that five hour flight from New York
I start spittin' G at a bitch like a pimp, mane
Tell her, ""Meet me at the Mondrian so we can do our thang.""
She can bring the lingerie with her, I sup-pose
Then we can go from fully dressed to just havin' no clothes
Then she can run and tell her best friend 'bout my sex game
Then her best friend could potentially be next, mane
Listen mane, shit changed, I came up, I'm doin' my thang
Homie, I'm holdin', holdin', holdin'
Oh shit, mane, the store owner watchin' you
Before somethin' get stolen, stolen, stolen

Wondering if you're gonna leave
Don't tell me what you see
That you actually believe it
Fuck, I'm blue
And all those photos that you like of a better life, better wife, better nights, better high
Goddamn right I miss drinking
Yeah, I do

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But I've been up late nights
Staring at the street lights
All the cigarette smoke, can't escape a closing window
And my head's like ""What happened to, it's alright?""
Baby, It's not alright
What if we're a closing window?

But I can't shake the feeling
That you picture a better life, better wife, better nights, better high
I can't shake the feeling (I can't shake the feeling)
Do you picture a better life?

[Verse 2]
I found myself up late feeling kinda jealous
Looking at the bullshit, other people's wellness
And it's got me thinking
It's just not you (not you)
I've been all night looking in the eyes of my baby
Right in front of me, what a gift, so amazing
Oh, that's what's true

Screaming at the street lights
All the cigarette smoke, filling up these hopeless lungs
Oh, and my head's like ""What happened to, it's alright?""

455,Skin (Sarabeth),"Sarah Beth is scared to death
To hear what the doctor will say
She hasn't been well
Since the day that she fell
And the bruise, it just won't go away

So she sits and she waits, with her mother and dad
And flips through an old magazine
Till a nurse with a smile
Stands at the door
And says, 'Will you please come with me?'

Sarah Beth is scared to death
'Cause the doctor just told her the news
Between the red cells and white
Something's not right
But we're gonna take care of you

Six chances in ten, it won't come back again
With the therapy we're gonna try
It's just been approved
It's the strongest there is
I think we caught it in time

Sarah Beth closes her eyes
She dreams she's dancing
Around and around, without any cares
And her very first love is holding her close
And the soft wind is blowing her hair

Sarah Beth is scared to death
As she sits, holding her mom
Says it would be a mistake
For someone to take
A girl with no hair to the prom

For just this morning, right there on her pillow
Was the cruelest of any surprise
And she cried when she gathered it all in her hands
The proof that she couldn't deny

Sarah Beth closes her eyes
She dreams she's dancing
Around and around, without any cares
And her very first love is holding her close
And the soft wind is blowing her hair

It's quarter to seven, that boy is at the door
Her Daddy ushers him in
When he takes off his cap, they all start to cry
'Cause this morning where his hair had been
Softly, she touches just skin

They go dancing
Around and around, without any cares
And her very first, true love is holding her close
And for a moment, she isn't scared",Rascal Flatts,2006,"[95, 77, 98]",3

We moved apart, girl, now we livin' separately

Loving you, my speciality, you my secret recipe
You helped me find myself, a part of my identity
My love, my oxygen, to me you a necessity
I hope this reaches you, if not, it's my serenity
Bars on my mind like I'm convicted for a felony
And ahh, that was a hard time
It's been a while since we talked, it's been a long time
I've been on my phone, checkin' if you online
Stalkin' up your page, wonder if you're on mine
Been a couple years, thought that I'd be over you
Still hold the tears when I think of holding you
You left and disappeared, I can't get a hold of you
I can't believe you'd do me wrong, was someone else controlling you?
'Cause after all the times, everything we been through
Every time you lie, I'd always defend you
And when I saw you cry, I'd just hold you gentle
For you I prayed to god, to me you like a temple
So tell me, did you love me or did you pretend to?
Everytime you touched me, was it even special?
Was I a priority or squeezed into the schedule?
Baby, you an angel, same time you the devil
After all the times, everything we been through
Every time you lie, I'd always defend you
And every time you'd cry, I'd just hold you gentle
For you I prayed to god, to me you like a temple

463,Shake,"[JACQUES]
All the world’s a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances,
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms;
And then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)
Best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin'

[Verse 2]
Sex, Love, Pain, baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til a nigga hit the jackpot, I'm saying

[Chorus]
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)
Best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)
Best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had

[Outro]
Uhh, ah yeah
See, this the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody
Just make sure they that special somebody

You know who you are
I got you",Drake,2006,[94],1
465,Stricken,"[Verse 1]
You walk on like a woman in suffering
Won't even bother now to tell me why
You come alone, letting all of us savor the moment
Leaving me broken another time
You come on like a bloodstained hurricane
Leave me alone, let me be this time
You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption
I don't want to mention, the reason I know

[Chorus]
That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss will I run

[Verse 2]
You don't know what your power has done to me
I want to know if I'll heal inside
I can't go on with a holocaust about to happen
Seeing you laughing another time
You'll never know why your face has haunted me
My very soul has to bleed this time
Another hole in the wall of my inner defenses
Leaving me breathless, the reason I know

[Chorus]
That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss will I run
Into the abyss will I run

[Verse 1]
You walk on like a woman in suffering
Won't even bother now to tell me why
You come alone, letting all of us savor the moment
Leaving me broken another time
You come on like a bloodstained hurricane
Leave me alone, let me be this time
You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption
I don't want to mention, the reason I know

[Chorus]
That I am stricken and can't let you go
When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
That I am crippled by all that you've done
Into the abyss will I run

[Outro]
Into the abyss will I run
I can't let you go
Yes I am stricken and can't let you go",Disturbed,2006,[95],1
466,Fix You,"[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

[Chorus: Chris & Will, Chris]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try, you'll never know
Just what you're worth

[Chorus: Chris & Will, Chris]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

[Instrumental]

[Bridge: Chris, Jonny, Guy, Will]
Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face
And I

[Breakdown: Chris, Jonny, Guy, Will]
Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face
And I

[Outro: Chris Martin]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you",Coldplay,2006,[97],1
467,Pretty Vegas,"Falling asleep at the wheel again, baby
You're drifting over the line, line, yeah
Your hands are tight but you're losing grip quickly
Fix me, can you read the signs?

Thumbing your way to Vegas, dirty
And dreaming of the other side
Save your tears and laughter
Because it doesn't matter what you find

It ain't pretty
After the show
It ain't pretty when the pretty leaves you
With no place to go
If you think you need it
Here's the place to feed it
But it ain't pretty

When everything that you do is wrong
And you feel like you can barely survive, yeah
When those around you are crumbling downwards
Buried in the sunset alive

Thumbing your way to Vegas, dirty
And screaming like you're back from hell
Save your dreams and occupations
'Cause it doesn't matter what you sell

It ain't pretty
After the show
It ain't pretty when the pretty leaves you
With no place to go
If you think you want it
Here's the place to get it
But it ain't pretty

The party's over and the road is long
The party's over and you're moving on
The party's over and the road is long

If you think you want it
Then just come out and say it
It ain't pretty

Falling asleep at the wheel again, baby
You're drifting over the line, line, yeah
Your hands are tight but you're losing grip quickly
Fix me, can you read the signs?

Thumbing your way to Vegas, dirty
And dreamin' like you're outta control
Save your tears and laughter
Because this is the ride
And this is the show

It ain't pretty
After the show
It ain't pretty when the pretty leaves you
With no place to go
If you think you want it
Just come in and get it
It ain't pretty",INXS,2006,[98],1
468,Rakata,"[Letra de ""Rakata""]

[Refrán: Yandel, Wisin]
Salte (Doble U con...)
Si no estás bailando con ella, salte (Y, Yandel)
Si no estás perreando con ella, salte
(Luny, medio millón de copias obliga'o)
Si no estás bailando con ella, salte
(El dúo de la historia, en ""Mas Flow 2""; ¡Sumba!)

[Coro: Yandel & Wisin]
Para hacerle rakata, rakata
Si se me pega voy a darle rakata, rakata
Esta noche quiero hacerle rakata, rakata
Si se me pega voy a darle rakata, rakata
Eh-eh

[Verso 2: Wisin]
(Me toca a mí)
Campicu, llego el frontú
No trates de apagarme porque te apagas tú
Doble U, apágale la luz
Mami, acelera duro ese cucú
Tiene veinte enemigas, dos amigas
Pantalla en la barriga, tatuaje en la vejiga
En el culipande'o ella mata la liga
Siga, si-si-si-siga

[Coro: Yandel & Wisin]
Para hacerle rakata, rakata
Si se me pega voy a darle rakata, rakata
Esta noche quiero hacerle rakata, rakata
Si se me pega voy a darle rakata, rakata
Eh-eh

[Verso 3: Wisin, Back-up singer]
(Nely, nos vamos)
Le gusta que Wisin la hale por el pelo
Grítalo (Papi, dame lo que quiero)
Siente la presión del callejero
Grítalo (Papi,dame lo que quiero)
Bizcochito, dame un beso con sabor a caramelo
Grítalo (Papi, dame lo que quiero)
Cielo, a ese trago le hace falta hielo
Grítalo (Papi, dame lo que quiero)
Pues tenga lo suyo, sin orgullo
Yo tengo el agua pa' ese capullo (Sss)
Mami, deja el murmullo
Coge lo que es tuyo (Tu-tu-tu-tuyo)

Para hacerle rakata, rakata
Si se me pega voy a darle rakata, rakata
Esta noche quiero hacerle rakata, rakata
Si se me pega voy a darle rakata, rakata
